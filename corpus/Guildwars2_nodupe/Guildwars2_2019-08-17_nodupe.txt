I'd prefer coffee, thanks.

---
The entire premise.
---
"what gw1 mechanics do you miss from gw2?"
---
Everybody knows that the only reasonable thing to do in front of a gate with a downed ally and enemy is to grab the ram and try to ram your ally.
---

---
That's why this is the default action.
---
Trying to test the pulse of WvW population after the post-mount exodus?
---
I don't think they could balance for 2v2 tho, that would require an insane amount of work and the rework of so many traits and spells.
---
All the pop culture references. They were so fun to find and always made me happy when Devs were willing to confirm what real life things were referenced in game.
---
Vindicators is also really useful in Siren's Reef because none of the ghosts let you rally hence why I love seeing it in that level. 
---
Unless of course We Bleed Fire is up because then you receive 6 fireball hits upon down with all the burning stacks in tow.
---
Class specific dances, too
---
I miss Heroes Ascent the most.
---
To go step by step: 
---
1.) Why do you care if I have a job? Yes, I do have a job. It was a completly unrelated question and indicates at best that you are a condescending asshole. 
---
2.) No, GW2 is not free to play. Which is exactly the point. For a F2P game such "money grabbing" strategies have to be expected, but not for a B2P game.
---
3.) Players/Customers are not a welfare organisation for gaming companies. Players will compare quality of service to price tag - and if other games offer a better value for your money they'll complain. 
---
4.) in a direct content comparision with other games are GW2 expansions a joke (4-5 maps). Even if you include LS. You could buy a well made game as skyrim or the witcher for the same price. 
---
5.) Anets team is mostly not busy with working on GW2.
---
6.) It is debatable if GW2 really is a better game than F2P games. Even more, if you keep in mind that you could spend 130€ on shop content before you reach the price tag of GW2.
---
Conclusion: sell an expansion for 30€ and people will complain if all mount skins are shop content. Offer the expansion for free and the same is fine, people got 30€ spare money to spend on mountskins.
---
Given that Anet has tied access to living story to ownership of expansions: Living story is expansion content. You paid for it. There is no "freeloading". Anet is just inefficiently wasting their money, instead of releasing content.
---
That's the face from the original meme.
---
It would have been kind of cool if one of the skills had the scrapper stab the ground with the hammer's head, and raise a heap of scrap attached to it, before dropping it on the ground.
---
Not the easiest but the ones people are willing to play around. If at all they wish to do that. Plenty of the current instabilities don't add another layer of difficulty but instead force you to utilize skills or even specs and classes which otherwise you wouldn't bother taking. 
---
Think of the "We Bleed Fire" in Underground Facility when you have to interact with the console. Only one stray fireball will interrupt your cast with the console. You'd either take a class able to cast Aegis on themselves to interact with the console and have the switch people step off to prevent more mob spawns or straight up stack a myriad of projectile destruction mitigation on top of them. That's just one of plenty examples. Bottom line is that many people would prefer to have the opportunity to play without a rock tied to their legs.
---
It was a threat. No one got perma banned even though they said they would. Also the exploit would have completely destroyed the economy.

That kid was a norn. As far as I know different races can’t procreate in gw2

Yes, its from Arthur, and he was like a mouse. thats his little sister
---
Not a mechanic but maybe Scepter would feel less insulting to me on Guardian if we had the *real* Ray of Judgement.
---
NPC's blocking the cloth/leather racks in the Black Citadel home instance and people putting crap near the bank in Mistlock and the chests in Auric Basin are the biggest offenders.

Chests/Bank/Nodes should ALWAYS be top priority

It's so rude of people living in Seattle to not work at 2 am. Smh head.

The initiative and interval facts are wrong and I reported them months ago but nothing happened
---
The skill costs 1 initiative but it does not replenish 1 initiative (initiative only appears in the skill description when it is the amount replenished, the initiative cost shows in the top right with a small icon). And the interval thing makes no sense, maybe a relic from the times when malice stacked over time
---
He was an aardvark. The part not left to preserve the integeity is part of the meme. Are you being deliberately dense?

Funny thing is that even though you dedicated so much time on a simple question you somehow didn’t manage to answer it in the process.

Being technically correct can still make you wrong.
---
It’s not a circle jerk when it’s an honest and fair complaint and the devs are radio silent on us. I swear this wait for the announcement is doing more harm to the community than good.
---
alliance battles, different dungeons from EOTN (18 all together), would have like to tried elite missions (urgoz, the deep)
---
People not liking your videos is not a core issue

Glad you’re enjoying the game, Gratz on the drop! That’s pretty rare from t1 fractals!

TY! :)

Both are examples of voluntary exchange. Some people WANTED to buy gold with gems, and were happy to do it. Others WANTED to buy gems with gold, and were happy to do it. It was a mutually beneficial transaction, with ANet taking a cut. It's also a way for the company to make money, and they also benefit. The employees get paid, and the shareholders are compensated for risking their capital. Everyone comes out ahead. Yet some want to step in and stop these these voluntary transactions because they somehow know better what other people should value.
---
You could stun lock, but you needed good timing. And of course a friendly ranger could interrupt the stun chain of the enemy warrior, for example.
---
I like how optimist you are.
---
This is the correct answer. Phase-shifted rift stalkers in Dragonfall evade all attacks when their defiance bar is broken.
---

---
are you? seems to come naturally for u
---
I'm pretty sure those don't exist at all in gw2.
---
It’s not even a real content drought. We know more is coming, and stuff was just release a few months ago. It’s nothing like the end of S2, where we had to wait 9 months for HoT (not yet at least). I think they’re just a few salty, entitled vets, that don’t really have a great perspective on things.
---
groupcontent in a mmo, be it what we see as raids, dungeons, fractals or stuff like ranked pvp or even gvg/wvw is what defines the endgame. i never even once used the word hardcore.  
---
hardcore players are those which push the boundarys on what is possible in a game, be it being one of the best players, having all achievements or simply being a tp baron...just what has this to do with playing "the endgame". nothing...players are perfectly fine there without being hardcore.  
---
maybe you shouldn't overthink too much about what other people write.
---
If you buy season 2 you can reset your progress and go for it before finishing the HoT story ;)

I'm getting back as well. Kinda nostalgic for some GW2.

He has access to both stats, the problem is he's unsure how or what he wants to play. He tends to pick up gameplay a bit slow but ultimately can be really good, the problem is lately he's been switching between builds/specs so often he can't seem to choose how to play either spec.

I don't know if you noticed, but religious people can be a tad humorless. That's basically what name rules exist for; ban all names that might cause outrage/scandal that the company would then have to deal with the fallout of.
---
Even if he is a religious figure, I'd think he would probably think its funny, a lot better than most uses of the name...
---
Some months ago I killed a warrior. He respawned right at the spot and finished me of.

That was really weird.

Or a scourge that was constantly teleporting into top of stone mist.

You killed him, 10 seconds later, he was in again.

- Half the time you get something less valuable than you would have before
---
- if you need a certain resource you have to unslot it
---
- if you're going out of your way to harvest a crappy node for something more valuable (like gold ore to platinum ore) it's easier, faster, and WAY more abundant to just.. farm that node....
---
It's seriously pointless
---
So you're saying this wasn't a Good Friday?
---
I'm a veteran player. The very best thing, absolutely best thing that Anet can do for me personally is to pander to new players. because that's how you get new players.
---
Every single MMO suffers from attrition. New players are starting from way behind to begin with. Would I delete everything I have over 7 years to start over now? No. It would never be worth it no  matter what they give to new players.
---
The point is, new players have a number of barriers to entry that must be overcome before they take over the game. Not getting new players is pretty much the death knell for any MMO. Natural attrition will greatly wear it down.
---
At the end of the day new players keep games alive. If you think that's not good for veteran players I don't know what to tell you. I didn't watch your video, though. You might have good points.
---
Wait until August 30th before giving up on GW2. The points you make in you video are considered mainstream perspective these days, 13 months ago you were way ahead of your time.
---
A single comment on Reddit (from someone no longer marked as ArenaNet, no less) doesn't really mean anything when the ToS says otherwise, unfortunately :/
---
everything.
---
Most likely some arse reported due to the reddit thread and he got an automatic forced rename rather than someone at ArenaNet manually putting it in. Or someone at ANet did it, but wasn't paying attention to what the name was and whether it was truly against their rules or not.
---
\+1 for using screenshot from Arthur :D
---
It has nothing to do with "butthurt cristians" or "lame people". Rules are rules.
---
If you break the rules, it doesn't matter if it's funny/cool/harmless, you still break the rules. We all literally agreed to be "lame" at this point.
---
this is so amazing , had to upvote.
---
I mean...it kinda was.

Good Friday was the day Jesus was put to death.
---
you do know the real jesus was a brown jewish/arab right?

This is hilarious, as Jesus was almost certainly not white.

It'll take a while to watch the whole thing, but for dungeon rewards I'll refer you to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/btfb7d/did_arenanet_ever_fix_dungeon_rewards/eox4ogz/) which calculates them as being higher now than before the change.
---
Maybe change it to Jesus Christ Superstardom? No one can trip off of that. *knocks on wood*
---
Leave Jesus alone Anet!!!!
---
Holy shit hes a holosmith
---
It has absolutely everything to do with it. What happened is some butthurt dude filed a complaint. That person is lame.
---
I don't agree with quite a few of the complaints (I do agree with some of them), but that doesn't stop this from being funny.
---
How now, brown cow.
---
Overly religious people have no sense of humor and are easily offended. The real Jesus probably wouldn't even care about this stuff.
---
Cheese n Rice

the flying spaghetti monster *isn't* a serious figure. pastafarianism was created to mock religion, no one actually believes in it, they just pretend they do.

OMG YES! I got into the post already thinking "Someone must have answered with 'Brown Cow, stunning!!', there's no way".
---
Thanks for this, I never understood why some of these would talk to me and some not.
---
I didn't say it wasn't, he asked why was it being downvoted.
---
He doesn't have a cursor to move because he has action camera toggled on, so it moves his camera instead. That's the issue.
---
What is an arvardk?
---
My water/ice ele (blue color theme) survived 3 years before I was forced to change her name. 
---
Her name was...

Frostitute :(
---
Name him "He died for your Gems"
---
Ah lol though i remember laughing when i saw that picture yesterday, how long did you have it before the forced name change?
---
As others are saying bounty gives you a chance at an extra strike. I think the most extra strikes I've gotten is 3, which means total of 4 harvests on a node that should give 1.
---
Thus if you're lucky enough to get a glyph of bounty, slap it on your sickle and reap (haHAA) the largest benefit.
---
It's a parody of a religion's diety for comedic reasons, for a meme. You have to use some serious mental gymnastics to get around that.
---
I loved when you died, you could jump into another party member's perspective and watch the game. That was awesome. 
---
And I miss vanquishing which was pretty much my favorite activity in Guild Wars 1.
---
Taco Markers has a literal path to each node in living world zones for map currency.   The normal nodes just show up on your map + a compass/distance to it.

so my attack speed increase ?

Congratz! Just a reminder, people on higher level fractals tends to be mostly toxic tryhards but don't let them affect you. There are still a lot of very nice people doing fractals too!
---
[The naming policy](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-naming-policy/) found directly on their website specifically says they don’t permit names that “Reference religious or historical figures.”
---
That other post is 3 years old so it looks like they changed their policy since then. I remember them having this stance for a pretty long time though.
---
Holysmith?
---
Oh god.
---
The skill format; multiple professions and elite skills made for more unique builds than any modern mmo can touch. Probably just too much to balance in the bigger and more pvp/wvw oriented gw2 format though.
---
Elite skill unlocking was so perfect.
---
Heroes and regular instanced map content, I thought it was awesome to build your own balanced team and operate in a vacuum, not saying i dont love the open mmo mechanics of gw2 but it gave a better gauge of difficulty and the effectiveness of your build.
---
Nostalgia-wise, pretty much any map but low level ones and pre/post searing ascalon in particular. Destroyers, raptors, underworld farming shit that game was so good in so many ways.
---
Too bad that’s too soon for him to pose with his Victory Rock...
---
at least its better than every post being someone posting their first legendary
---
Good Luck on the survey! Xhex.9728
---
Whoops. Fixed that. Cap is +3 strikes to any non-rich node, according to the wiki.
---
Infusion effects are not a part of the wardrobe and can't be used across multiple chars. It would be a massive downgrade until that's changed imo.
---
I did not expect it to be consistent across all the nodes, well played anet well played.
---
That's how you can get your account banned. Went through this with the support before. My name was offensive in a non supported language that I did not and still not speak. They basically said if I name it similar again they would ban the entire account.
---
Actually I have a feeling that the 25% isn't overshadowed by potions, cause when I farmed fractal 61 I would go faster when there was this instability. (Normal size)
---
&gt; -The lack of support for dungeons/fractals or meaningful rewards
---
Still no support for dungeons (which is normal since they said they would not be doing it anymore).
---
In Fractals you have the [Account Augmentations](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account_Augmentation) to go after and specifically the Mist Attunements now. It's a long-ish grind (depending on how much relics you already have in store) but it's a nice abjective to pursue.
---
The Shattered Observatory Fractal was release a bit over 2 years ago so I'm not sure if you had already too taken a break then. If it was the case this fractal has a CM (so that's a 2nd one) and has 2 infusions linked to it. We've had 3 new fractals meanwhile iirc [Twilight Oasis](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Twilight_Oasis_Fractal), [Deepstone](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deepstone_Fractal) and [Siren's Reef](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Siren%27s_Reef_Fractal). They do not have CMs but they have the benefit of being new. I think we've also had in this time some rework of Molten Boss (big rework), Aquatic Ruins, Molten Furnace and Mai Trin (less boring when Mai Trin phases).
---
Apart from that there is no other new shiny fractal specific reward, gold is still good though. Not sure when the meta started to shift but now FB + Ren are the way to go even when you want a healer so that could be a bit refreshing for you if you were playing support.
---
&gt;-Felt like the game was becoming more cash-grabby with outfits galore and mount lootboxes
---
They came back a bit from the mount lootboxes and you have a choice now which is basically "less expensive but RNG pick" against "more expensive but you chose what you get". As for the outfits there still are some (mostly because they still kinda need to make some money) but the Living World Episodes have brought some very nice weapon and armor skins (could be kinda grindy to do them all but that's to be expected).
---
&gt;-Only progression being progressively becoming an eye-sore via infusions
---
There is still no gear grind so it's not like much has changed there? They recently released the [Legendary Runes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_Rune) and [Legendary Sigils](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_Sigil) if that can count as progression for you. There is no comestic effect on those, only pure functionality of being able to pick any Rune/Sigil you want at any time. They are expensive to make (6 runes wuld cost about as much as 6 pieces of a PvE leg armor) but hey, they are Legendary things so that makes sense.
---
&gt;-Next to no support for PvP or WvW
---
I've not been playing it a lot lately but from I can see it's not non-existent but it's not that great either. There has been some "funny" week/weekends for WvW such as "No Downstate" with boosts to WvW xp and reward track gain. They unfortunately introduced a mount to WvW which could make it a bit annoying to play in there while you don't have it (mostly need to 1 Reward track and capture 1 of each objective, SM excluded).

I probably forgot some thing so if anyone else stumbles on this feel free to complete what I wrote as my memory is not that good about what happened in the last 2 year :p

Reminds me of the writer who got assassinated because he made a mocking illustration of Mohamad... You can be as religious as you want, but thinking your beliefs are invulnerable to everything is kinda pathetic
---
Look at the character's attire and name. Stop strawmanning an arguement because you can't formulate a better arguement yourself. I'm not at all offended by this, I'm annoyed at how uncivilized and inconsiderate society has become because it seems cool to be nonchalant and inflammatory. Its as if adolescent angst is a sign of intellectual superiority.
---
Well it 100% is against the naming policy 
---
&gt;We do not permit names that:
---
Have offensive racial, ethnic, national, or cultural connotations
---
Include hate speech or bigoted slurs
---
Reference sexual acts or real life violence
---
Are pornographic
---
Make inappropriate references to human anatomy or bodily functions

Reference illegal drugs or activities

Reference religious or historical figures

The only thing I do is raid and I'm not complaining. GW2 isn't the only game out there and why are you forcing yourself to play if you don't like it? Where is the logic in that? I mean if we look at the history of the game, complaining has never worked so why even bother? If the game is dead just move on to another one.
---
Genius. Named my Maplestory 2 Priest in a similar fashion, Priestitute.
---
Fuck you Reddit
---
Could you copy/paste their e-mail?
---
Non of that might be what really happened.
---
You don't need to them, but the expansions are super helpful. Especially Path of Fire, due to mounts. They really change how you get around maps. It's so much more fun compared to walking on foot. The story isn't bad either. 
---
Heart of Thorns is recommended too. It introduces gliding, more challenging PvE (though it still isn't super-hard), great maps. Also IMO the best story so far. 
---
You also get access to new attribute combinations for gear and additional elite specializations for the existing professions.
---
Generally your character does not progress anymore in terms of skills after level 80,but you can unlock masteries (two of which I described above: mounts and gliding, another one are legendary crafting) for your account. Masteries will add new things you can do. 
---
But even without expansions you could try your hands on mastering fractals. They can be fun to learn and gear up for. They are like mini-dungeons and exist in tiered difficulty settings gated by their own agony mechanic: Certain attacks in higher fractals deal agony damage, which is super high and also hinders healing. You can gear up against agony with agony resistance. 
---
Possibly Raids might be interesting, too. Someone else will have to answer details about them, though. 
---
For WvW I'd recommend the expansions again (Path of Fire especially), because a mount is pretty much mandatory. It's a lot of fun, don't listen to people saying that it's dead.
---
PvP also someone else will have to answer stuff about. Mounts are not needed here.
---
Doing runs for $$$ (i.e running to crystal desert from ascalon for 8k ea)

---
The OG T-pose
---
I know it's been told to you but it is absolutely 100% because he doesn't get the backing and resources that he cannot do more. He already does the most of all devs have ever done for pvp/wvw (besides Grouch) communities and trying to listen and implement things we ask for.
---
After 6 years I think picking a class that looks interesting and starting at the beginning is probably best.
---
If you want to continue with your necro I'd look on the TP for some [Named Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Named_armor) it's often quite cheap and probably like Kaihann says run a power minion master build. 
---
&gt; Where should I go?

Try to catch some of the world boss events. A timer can be found [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_boss)

The Expansions do offer a lot, almost too much but that's great for a new player yet overwhelming. Even as a Core Tyria player just pick a direction and go for it! You're free to do whatever idea is possible in GW2.
---
And if you see ArenaNet offering free stuff or discounts (not third party) just take it!

It's hard to see people leaving unless you play one of the less populated game modes where if a group of people leave then that becomes a significant population drop. Right now, the NA PvP, WvW and raid scene are very quiet. Hopefully Aug 30 brings interest and players back in.
---

I'm so sick of shit like this, fuck anet. And there censorship and phoney family friendly attitude.  13 year olds swear more than anyone else.  And why is jesus christ offensive.  Fucking the real snowflakes right here.

I have to strongly disagree about the SoI change.  
---
That shit ***NEEDED*** to happen.  SoI has historically been one of the most overpowered skills in this game ***since LAUNCH.***
---
I'm definitely not hater, but the fact is I spend a lot more time waiting in LFG now than I used to 1-2 years ago. The playerbase for the content I'm interested in is declining, and that hinders my own play experience, which will eventually drive me away from the game as well. For me, the game \_is\_ dying. Not dead yet, but definitely going that way.

Pastafarians didn't write a book with some totally random stuff a thousand of years ago and then call it the book of books. Had they done that, whatever the content, you'd be good to go.

&gt; It sounds like your biggest complaint is the same as most hardcore veterans. You love GW2, but you want more of it. Not much you can do but keep one eye on it and come back when it better meets your needs, or when your needs change to match it.

Also a big difference between constantly saying “it’s a dead game” and wanting more raid &amp; competitive content.  I’d particularly love to see more WvW updates released, as I feel it’s the mode with the most long term replayability. That doesn’t mean I’ll act in a destructive manner and trash the game until I get my way.

---
Yes, you can go F A S T in both WoW and GW2. The difference is: In GW2 you have to fulfill certain conditions (have some decent height for gryphon, have relatively flat terrain for beetle) to be able to achieve maximum speed.
---
In WoW, it's just: Fart 5000 gold into a vendor's hand. BAM, now you can fly F A S T. ^(Note: This is about 72 **cents** worth of gold nowadays from Blizzard themselves) 
---
Additionally, GW2 requires that you remain active while piloting gryphon/beetle, otherwise you land or crash into something and lose all that speed.
---
In WoW, you just: Fly up. Point in general direction of objective. Press autorun. Go and make a sandwich.
---
I agree, just run the opposite direction, its not worth your time.

you might not have gotten any but anet would hear about it one day and they dont wanna deal with that. and their system forces a name change after certain amount of reports, you can still discuss with support if your name should be allowed or not

Come to think of it. Isn't it weird to have strict rules regarding names on supporter languages only? Like a bad word in German is a no-go, but in Swedish for example, no one bats an eye.

Double standards?

Ooh yeah, I remember those. R/N! It was so much fun running after other players knowing that all you need to wreck them is a little touchy touchy.

&gt;Sooo... yeah. Someone did pick up the name even though it's on the filter (I just tried making a character named Dios; got the 'blocked by filter' error). I'll look into how someone got a name we dinged you for. That's just not cool on our part.
---
Now, since we're all here, this is a great time to talk about our naming policy and the recent changes in how support enforces it.
---
In the past; our team was very strict about what we'd allow. As an example we'd censored Girthquake Clamhammer. I love that name; personally. Funny as hell.
---
Poopy Cat Butt? Censored - too filthy. I Eat Farts? Eww, no.
---
Now? We'll allow those. Did I mention funny as hell?
---
As my boss put it once -
---
"If dude wants to be known as cat poop that's his problem; not mine".
---
And that's our philosophy now. This change has been evolving over the past few months as we get feedback on what the community does/doesn't want to see in game. Essentially; if your name doesn't express hate and doesn't violate our game-rating we're probably gonna let it live on. This includes deity names. Going forward you're probably going to see **Jesus Christ**, God, and Allah running around Tyria.
---
Also; any bets on how fast someone claims the name "Cat Poop"?
---
*Edit - Diety to Deity; cause that's a different discussion.

Magdaer doesn't really relate to Jormag at all though. Nor does the Foefire.
---
In addition, Magdaer is the *cause* of the curse. Sohothin - which Rytlock has as you pointed out - is the *breaker* of the curse. Or so Season 2 lead us to believe. Rytlock nearly succeeded in cleansing the Foefire by obtaining Adelbern's crown and using it to unlock Sohothin's true power, but he was missing some unknown component (if legends ring true, the blood of Doric aka Jennah or Wade).
---
Most of us who say the game is dying/dead generally aren't the haters. We love the game and are sad to see it decline as we believe it is one of the best MMOs out there.
---
atleast 4 or 5 hours
---
me too :s (France)

welcome!
---
I want to say boost one char and unlock the raptor mount and gliding for your whole account, but you are completely new and it probably wouldnt be a good experience. also: BIG spoilers.
---
what kind of classes do you prefer in other games?
---
In fairness, GW2 has had the best uptime record of any MMO I've ever played, and I've been playing MMOs since \~2001. It's very rare that outages occur; we're talking a handful of days in the 7 years since release.
---
But Dios has transitioned to a normal name just like Christian, Andreas, Matthias etc.
---
Ješuš ĆrisT
---
While what you say is *mostly* true (Rurik's soul is in the Hall of Heroes unless they retcon it like they did with Turai Ossa), all evidence points to Sons of Svanir/Jormag plot, and not an Ascalon plot.

Which is disappointing to me.

Maybe it's because of them adding the class. Just like you're not allowed to name your character after NPCs

WTF ANET THATS LIKE 2ND TIME IN 6 YEARS ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

Not very often, GW2 is surprisingly stable in open world (story instances are a different thing - it's disastrous there). But don't expect those incredibly rare cases to be resolved in a timely manner.
---
Run before it's too late
---
It's been for so long right now... oh, my sweet nice trebuchets at Bay and Garrisson... I will miss them so much :'(
---
This \^\^
---
However, being new it might be a little overwhelming starting out in PoF and HoT. Maybe you should play with a character till about lvl 30, then use your lvl80 boost. Once you use your boost unlock the raptor mount and the glider by doing your stories.
---
Unfortunately they have a habit of making plots too short. Season 3 is rife of "too short plots mashed together".
---
That said, I don't really see them being capable of spending more than two episodes on it. Especially since there's no room for new maps in the epicenter of the Foefire stuff. Besides, I feel that cleansing the Foefire is less of an arc in of itself, and more a lead-in to a potential charr civil war, given that one of the three imperators is against the human-charr peace treaty, and there's tribunes of both other legions who're against it too. And on top of that, a charr civil war plot would be far more interesting to me than dealing with yet *another* army of mindless, no will, mooks.
---
i have been occasionally getting some level 80 equipment from events and what not and idk if its good so keep them or does it not really matter whether i sell it or not? i can also salvage them but idk what the best idea is, should i keep all exotic and higher stuff and salvage the rest? i dont know

Inb4 current instance will close due to inactivity. You have 60 minutes.

A couple of times that I remember. What usually happens after a patch is that there are bugs somewhere -I'm lucky and I've only been affected by those bugs a couple of times where I could not go on in a raid or finish a mission- and they throw a couple more patchs the next days.

And christianity was paganism draped in new robes. Either they're treating all religions equally or they're hypocritic.

The technology isn't there yet.

I'm not even being sarcastic, for MMOs it's impossible to have realistic physics and stable connection for every single person.
---
Generally I'm a sucker for cool deaths and unfortunately I don't think GW2 has many. I want cinematic deaths dammit! I thought we'd get more with raids, but unfortunately they seem to spend more time on the *entrance* (hello Samarog and Deimos) than on the *exit*. 
---
I loved that Balthazar death though.
---
I played wow while back (cataclysm dropped) and i loved quick gameplay where you actually need to do something. Like different spells and stuff with great mobility. I played rogue and mage mostly. Is there something similar?
---
That's just lame though. Way to take the fun out the game.
---
&gt; I skip so much terrain with the Skyscale that, at times, I almost feel like it was a mistake to implement it. 
---
Then don't skip the terrain :)
---
Hey, I was in your situation about a year ago and i made a big mistake, I used the boosters way too early. What I would do is to try all the clases first before confirming the booster. U can also watch videos and try too find a class that catches you eye, as that is the most important thing, having fun. Also some classes are better for some things, so try to watch pve/pvp/wvw to see what u fancy the most and then choose. But really don't hurry and enjoy it.

To expand with a clarification: Windows treats "shut down" as hibernation these days (check your up time), whereas restart actually closes everything down and boots the system up fresh.

Well he originated in the middle east so chances of him being Caucasian are slim at best, he most likely was brown skinned due to the local climate. Yes we do not know for certain what he looked like, or if he even existed to begin with, but we can definitely make an educated guess by taking multiple factors into account. So basically truth is offensive to Polish Catholics because it doesn't agree with their fan art of Jesus. Ok.

At worst OP is simply correct, because following the letter of the "law" these are all forbidden.

Don't worry he will be back:-D

---
She says she’s got the sword, not the uncle
---
“Nyla Dagdottir: But I've got my Uncle Beemish's magical sword!”
---
So your theory is that a random npc we never head about was contacted by Eir to repair a magical sword but then forgot about it so the blacksmith just repaired it and gifted the flaming sword to his young niece? 
---
If anything, Eir would’ve taken the sword to Beigarth, a skilled blacksmith that has appeared in the personal story, season 1, and HoT. The first blacksmith to craft deldrimor steel in modern times, which was used to fell a jotun king. 
---
Either way. It was Balthazar who reignited Sohothin’s flame, so I doubt a simple norn blacksmith could reignite Magdaer.
---
Weavers are vulnerable to chill. They rely on constantly changing attunements.
---
Why chill is so effective?
---
They have two skills for CC survival, primoridal stance, which has two charges and grants stablity, twist of fate that stunbreaks, evades, and also grants a little superspeed. As for condi and barrier,
---
A little list should give you an idea, there are a few more I missed (not all can be traited at same time but you get the idea):
---
Heal when switching an attunement
---
Heal when attuning to water
---
Cleanse a condi when switching to air (traited synergy with another trait)
---
Gain a barrier after usig a dual skill
---
Gain a barrier on dodge roll
---
Cast a spell after a dodge roll (including a heal in water that cleanses 2 condis)
---
Sword fire/earth 3 also adds a big barrier that is probably what you are seeing. Stacked with dual skills and dodges it can become really massive. If you see this skill activated, dont waste your main damage skills on the barrier.
---
Aim your CC for the end of their evade, if you time it right it'll basically be almost undodgeable. 
---
If he is literally minstrel build, just ignore like ignoring healing scrappers which are even worse with invulns, lots of stab, stealth, superpseed, projectile reflect, even larger barriers etc. 
---
It is very likely he is running water traits which synergises with weaver to cleanse condi. Still, if you stack enough condi, as many different condis as you can including chill he'll likely be in trouble as he needs to switch to cleanse. Don't just back off and wait but do not spam your abilities either, they have a lot of evades. On S/d (I assume) they have evade on water 2, earth 2 and air 5 along with 2x evade on twist of fate, two regular evades + 1 energy sigil.
---
If he is running antitoxin runes, then lmao.

Oh its superquick, you start the path of fire quest on a level 80 character, complete it and you got your mount forever.

---
If only you had the option of getting off the Skyscale when you feel this way.
---
Do a level 80 account and play core story the regular way with no interuptions. Because you unlock the story every 10 levels. That way doing map stuff won't feel too forced. By that time you'll get a sence of the game more or less. Then you have an option either to start PoF story and get the first mount only and continue on with HoT (so it was in order). Or don't get the mount and do HoT first. If you buy ls seasons 2,3,4 then the order of story is better.

I've never heard of anyone named Dios, it must not be a common name, or depends where you live. Jesus on the other had, I've heard of plenty of people named as such. Luna is also latin and spanish for the moon.

Aside from Taco, no. But the site https://gw2efficiency.com/gathering/permanent-nodes has a pretty cool system for copying locations to the rich nodes.

Yes. It's not that you are getting more orichalcum from an orichalcum node*, but you have a 33% chance of dropping some ore when you gather something with the glyph, regardless of what you're getting.

I have the leather one, I currently have it installed in an axe, so when I go to farm wood, I get some leather as well. 
---
*This is what the glyph of bounty does, making it more valuable (i.e it works with living world nodes).
---
Okay, gonna give you an unorthodox opinion.
---
Without the episodes in between expansions, the story flow won't matter anyway. Even if you buy them all, S1 cannot be replayed, and they throw a bunch of characters at you in S2 you are supposed to know. Buying the episodes is sometimes as big, or more of an investment as the expansions, and i wouldn't buy S2 anyway, it doesn't give maps like the rest do.
---
Base game is not up to today's standards, and without mounts, it's really slow.
---
SO! I'd boost a character i like, do the very first part of PoF till you get a raptor. Then you can play whatever part you like.
---
Avoid playing a Mesmer first, it turned away my buddy from playing. Engi is not that straightforward neither.
---
Necro is super easy, and can solo a LOT!
---
Do you even play the game? Tons of stuff can knock you back and cause you to fall off a ledge!
---
I would recommend playing at least one character  from 1 to 80 in the core world before using a boost just so you have that experience
---
Sorry but you perfectly well know where the line is. It's called common sense and people should use it more often. If you have to open google to find out if it's a worshiped character somewhere you are fine. If everybody on the planet knows the worshiped character you probabbly will have to change the name at some point.
---
The only thing anet did for names is restict the worst and then request name changes based on reports. They specifically have a broad definition so they can request a name change in anycase but won't do so if no one is offended.
---
Hesus christo
---
The funny thing is I expirience the opposite. I'm in a guild that keeps growing, getting new players and old ones returning to the game daily. 
---
Perhaps the facts should count more than personal experience, since that's not a factual thing. 
---
So follow your own advice and stop being influenced by who don't know the game, talking trash about it on YouTube. 
---
And you are basicly just repeating what I said.. Group content defines a MMO and there's plenty of group content that MANY players engage in. Metas, world bosses and guild quests are some. WvW is going strong every time I jump in (It might not have changed much - but ppl still play), I have no problem getting a grp for fractals. But dungeons and raids are not as fun. 
---
It just so happend that raids is a big part of other games like wow and that is what many use as measure for food end game content. Guild wars has gone another way and made much of the group content "open world". It's much more like a sandbox instead of instanced. 
---
And the RPG part is way bigger in gw2 than in many other games.
---
So ppl are unsatisfied - well let them. I would be that as well if I wanted an Apple but got an orange.
---
Given how much the limited flight of the skyscale changed, gonna have to disagree with that.
---
I don't think that enough has changed in gw2 for you to come back at least not on a daily regular basis
---
Skilllag in EU WvW is still a problem in big fights
---
Living Story is nice but only lasts for few hours and the maps look good but its still the same grind each time
---
spvp/wvw balancing is still a joke nothing they tried has helped against the powercreep
---
It makes the actual design of the world and any challenges it creates completely irrelevant, it makes people less likely to encounter each other in the open world, generally you just interact with the game world itself far less. You just hop on your mount and bypass anything and everything between you and whatever your objective happens to be.
---
if he were real at all, he came from a group of people who followed the Judaic philosophy and were originally from the Arabic races.. they tended to not have relations with people from other races or religions back then, so its safe to say jesus was brown.
---
I imagine because sending a pre-built "rename your character please" request is just sliiiightly easier than delivering raids every 3 months, re-assesing WvW balance, better communication/roadmaps, and whatever else people want.
---
openworld events is mostly not playing together in gw2, its playing alongside. if you think that is good groupcontent, well then i feel sorry for you.  
---
there is a reason why even the big event guilds which killed triple trouble or tequatl the first time for example died out. or one of the biggest gw2 communitys closed off not too long ago. or why the other gw2 communitys have a big bleeding players problem.  
---
may as well just blabber what everyone says which is new to the game. sorry to burst your bubble, but if you join a 7 year old game and say there is so much stuff to do...hello, its 7 years old and got a shitton of updates. sure there is much to do. you are 7 years late mate.  
---
that doesn't invalidate what ever veteran says and experiences. just because there are a lot of new players running arround, which is do not say that its a bad thing, doesn't mean that the other end is as nice.  
---
get it in your fucking head. anet doesn't listen to anything since years and now we got problems. welcome to the club once you are this far in the game. don't start whining when it starts hitting you too.
---
The policy is intentionally vague so a degree of common sense can be applied. Almost every company does this.
---
Hugh Jass
---
That is completely their fault. The developers putting limits still also put limits on the fun people have. Just because some people choose to do what they don't like justifies ruining the experience for everyone?
---
The beetle stamina bar is also something I hate. It made me not use the beetle almost at all.
---
You are not mean, as long as you do not insult me directly, please provide whatever arguments you wish, it is for the sake of the debate.
---
I don't usually insult, but I don't repay smartassery with cotton candy either. And he was being one.
---
that's a capital offense
---
I laughed at how the picture crops to the crotch part on my phone xD
---
It looks fantastic, It's a shame that it's just an outfit, that helmet would look perfect on my engineer. Wish Anet made armor sets again instead of just outfits.
---
This must be why all the game-breaking bugs in WvW stick around !   
---
Because Anet is too wish-washy to actually get around to deciding to fix it.
---
Nope. The old way to travel was using flight paths, think of it like a waypoint, except a Griffin flies you there so it takes time.  Otherwise you run on a mount, which just have flat speed increases.
---
When flying mounts were created, as soon as you got one flight paths became irrelevant because there are no limits.  Like the post above, just fly up point the direction, auto-run.
---
Do they know about the healing turret though? Because in most instances it is me and maybe one other person doing them. So you tell them turret is up and another person come. So you explain to them that you have to do turrets or boss will heal up and get told to shut up and stop being so fucking toxic and maybe focus on the fight instead *facepalm*
---
That's hypocritical as fuck from them, as I reported a sexual Hungarian name many times over many months last year, and the character still has the same name. I opened a ticket, but the GM said it's basically fine if the character is called the equivalent of "daughter of boobs".
---
(And I don't think it could have been a non-Hungarian user, as the word for boobs was "csöcs", I can't see anyone randomly happening to type that.)
---
So you made a choice and now you blame others for it.... ok
---
So, I've finally dropped GW2Hook in favor of Reshade so that I could use d912pxy.
---
I'm wondering if anyone had any presets similar to /u/mehrune123's [Vivid Lighting Preset](https://old.reddit.com/r/WoodenPotatoes/comments/6xa734/giveaway_and_megathread_guild_wars_2reshade_30/dmf177w/) which used GW2 Hooks custom shaders.
---
Off to the gulag with you!
---
Gray scale phone art again. Kaym, Fera and  Kraat are demonstrating their new idea for patrol pairs. Jenka is left out speechless. :)
---
Time to change the name to "Stale Bread N Wine"
---
[hmmmm](https://i.imgur.com/FCLXy6g.jpg)
---
It may seem fun when you don't have it. If full flight becomes available, it becomes the norm.  Now, everyone who doesn't use their full flight is basically just crippling themselves compared to the rest of the players.
---
Think about WvW now that the warclaw is out.  I could choose not to use the warclaw, because I don't like it. What happens: I can't keep up with zergs, I can't run from those who use the mount, I have little chance to kill someone on a mount.  People will use the better option whether they like it or not because they have to in order to keep up with the game.
---
Is there a specific reason why you wanted that name gone? I mean, I see offensive names in my language all the time, but really haven't felt the need to report it.
---
editable ui
---
map shard selection
---
build variety and templates...instead of nerfing everything to the ground like gw 2 when something becomes too fun, instead they allowed a lot of insane build styles for pve...also the skills not being fixed to a certain weapon, this still seems weird to me in gw 2

better ranger pet and necro minion mechanics

Next time do your nickname "Syka" or "Xyu" or "Mraz" or "Pizda" these are russian swear words. It is not supported language. Only dredges can understand it. If you want more examples you can contact me.
---
XD
---
Ahh Reddit. Once again you are no fun allowed.
---
Ok, it is Charr shit in Azura rest room...
---
&gt; Exactly, it already changed so much, why not just take the final step?
---
Because it would change even more, which would be bad, and I would argue the changes that the skyscale made were already bad.
---
&gt; We can get on any high ground easily, especially with Bond of Vigor, and then use the griffon to fly to the other side of the map in no time.
---
The limitations on the griffon make it fine. You still have to interact with the map and the mount. It's not really comparable.
---
Well, for me at least, it was never truly about the cake. It was about eating the cake with friends. Of course it has to be a good cake, and Gw2 is the best cake, but still it is a mere catalyst of the 'cake-eating experience' that I enjoy so much. This unfortunately means I can't just come and go as I please as I have to take into account the schedule and appetite of my friends as well. 
---
The issue that I, and I believe other veterans/hardcore/whining players (pick what you prefer), have is that getting my friends together for a nice cake party is getting harder and harder. Some are getting sick of the same old cake, some have switched to eating apple pie, some simply have made plans by the time new cake is announced. On top of that, the cake makers seem to have little interest in making party sized cakes, this is completely up to them, but unfortunate for me. 
---
Of course you can make new friends, but there's only so many times you can watch your friends leave before feeling alone, regardless of whether that is technically true. Leaving for a while won't solve this at all, tbh it'll probably make it worse.
---
For now I still have a nice group to play with, but I have to face fact that once they are gone, so will I. Maybe I'll give that apple pie a shot after all.
---
Condi mirage is still good even with CI disabled.
---
I don't know if it still exists, but at Rata Novus Lane during Chak Gerent Meta Event the orange AOE fields that appear during the break bar don't deal any damage or knockdown, which could be used to deal some nice damage to the not moving boss while not receiving any damage except for maybe the blue expanding aoes. As most of the times the boss will rush over the entire area when not being locked in place due to the breakbar, that might have been a reason to say "no cc" \^\^ But idk if that's still a thing \~
---
There is so many people call variations of zeus.
---
Done, hope it helps. Shadowassasin.5127
---
Because they're easy to sell and people like them.
---
Jesus Christ gets a name change while just yesterday I saw a character running around with the name "Need More Lube"
---
Because everybody who says anything against this funny rule break have to be a butthurt christian, right?
---
I don't care about any religion at all, but if you say that only "butthurt christians" say that rules are rules and shouldn't be break not matter for what reasons and if you feel better with this thinking, please do so.
---
not to mention that it's incredibly fun to dodge obstacles with the beetle
---
I never said anything different. I never said anything about butthurt christians at all and I don't care about them. ;)
---
&gt; That's how humans work.
---
So it is not their fault they choose something? You could say it is not a rapist's fault, because all humans want sex.
---
&gt; Every single game in existence has limits. Limits are literally how you create gameplay.
---
So this justifies a ton of more limits, right?
---
&gt; a) The experience isn't ruined for you
---
I am sorry, you do not get to decide what is ruined for me and what is not, just like I cannot say what you like and what not. This just seems like arrogance.
---
&gt; b) It's not just "some people", it's pretty much everyone.
---
Look up the number of posts by unique users, both on reddit and on the official forum then.
---
&gt; but in actuality it's trying to create proper gameplay.
---
_Trying_
---
&gt; If it started with full stamina you'd basically never use anything else on the ground.
---
Not really, there is still a lot of terrain full of holes, ravines and trees/rocks, not to mention the other mounts still have better handling.
---
How do you see this "act" ?
---
There is a big difference between irony and insults.
---
Yet people blatantly hacking are allowed to persist needlessly for months, presumably for evidence gathering purposes.  In the meantime they do more damage to the game than outrage over a character name would ever cause.  If somebody is butthurt over someone using the name "Jesus" then there is a lot of bad news waiting for them in Central/South America and Africa.
---
We had some Underworld hacker yesterday. Some ppl were porting in our EBG Keep top of the tower at the Vista.
---
Poor life choices? Nope, none of those here. =3
---
Probably got reported by the conservatives of this sub.
---
Judging by Anet staff's personal social media accounts linked to here in the past I don't think a Christian in anything more than name would last very long before getting brow beaten out of that company.
---
Sorry we ruined your name. We just thought it was so funny.
---
According to [THIS](https://www.guildwars2.com/en-gb/legal/guild-wars-2-naming-policy/) he did. 
---
&gt; We do not permit names that: Reference religious or historical figures
---
It doesn't matter what a single Dev wrote, the rules are what counts, not a statement. The statement you linked is just wrong (yes, even Devs do mistakes) and also 3 years old. That's no excuse.
---
See you in 3 days or so...I guess.
---
But it is not disrespectful? His character looks badass. And if it wasn't for the sunglasses, it would be a pretty good approximation of how Jesus might have looked, given the limitations of gw2 clothing.
---
I love how they feel so pleased with themselves
---
Jethuth Chritht
---
&gt;But even if we call it buy-to-play, do you really think the game sales themselves, which only happen once per player, are enough to keep a game and its company running for years? 
---
Did you only read my first sentence?
---
I'm a fan of that naming scheme
---
&gt; Let's try it again.
---
Are you suggesting deliberately doing something problematic to then cause issues to support?
---
&gt; The reply implied "he was thinking in a simplified way"
---
As opposed to treating the person as an idiot by acting as if they didn't know how to dismount.
---
Oh wait, I see you did the same thing.
---
Stop. Your. Bullshit.
---
I feel attacked. lol
---
The same "PoF screenshot pre-designed to be popular" [twice](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/crjf5p/the_skyscale_allows_us_to_view_some_content/) in one day? That's new.
---

With the exception that the latter was a *direct* insult.
---
&gt; Oh wait, I see you did the same thing.
---
Where? You are now seeing non-existent replies?
---
&gt; Stop. Your. Bullshit.
---
You still did not highlight the bullshit, so I am going to assume you are trolling.
---
He's claiming it can only be reached with a Skyscale. I'm just making it clear you can reach it and get a better view with the Jackal mount.
---
Wine you whining about
---
I changed the colors a little bit after I ordered the picture but the colors from the screenshots in a comment above are Gold Fusion, Gold and Cocoa, on the arms and legs I also used Golden Sheen
---
It took a lot of whisky and bacon to come up with this idea. :)
---
Calling things simplied is actually not an insult.
---
&gt; Then don't skip the terrain :)
---
This content has been there since PoF release, and I've seen it on the frontpage a dozen times. Along with the pyramid in Crystal Oasis, it's one of those places which were *designed* to be very spectacular and screenshot-worthy, so it gets posted very often.
---
LVL 56 ranger, im conpleting a 50-60 zone but I've completed everything except for 59/60 level stuff in the zone. I'm getting killed really quick, curious what I should use as a gap filler to get me up a few levels. I heard dungeons were pretty good exp.
---
The overly religious people forced him to change his name. It totally wasn't arena net...
---
I couldn't use Tayta Tawt. Got a 3 day suspension after just changing the first name.
---
Using the word especially quite obviously means you place them at a higher position than others, so you're clearly full of shit.
---
Literally nowhere in that post did they claim that you can only reach it with a Skyscale. All they did was share a new angle of the same view.
---
Even though he did (anybody did obviously), you have no rights to call him a "butthurt christian" except you just want to insult this person. In this case it's against the reddit and subreddit rules, so you shouldn't be that stupid. 
---
You also have no rights to judge this person for what he did. If a person feel offended by an character name that breaks the rules, he has every rights to report this person. The reason *why* he reports this person is his personal thing, that doesn't concern you or me or anybody else. What matter is that he is right, no matter what you or anybody else say.
---
&gt; With gameplay. Pointing up and then pointing down while avoiding every part of the game you would normally have to do is patently different from engaging in gameplay. This is like saying that having the ability to one-shot a raid boss is the same as doing the fight normally, just taking less time, because you end up at the same place.
---
So let people decide how to navigate (with or without gameplay).
---
Raid bosses are different because they are beaten for materials rewards, not for scenery.
---
&gt; Evading mobs by using skills vs evading mobs by pointing your camera up and then alt tabbing... one is navigation and engaging with the game and one is not.
---
Same as above - people should decide how to play the game i  their own style, as long as it does not affect others (and navigating does not affect others).
---
&gt;Look at the other post I wrote about the psychology of this sort of thing. Yes, it is technically, physically possible for a player to not mount. That is completely beside the point.
---
I understand. It is, however, more dependent on tastes.
---
&gt; I can say that my fun would be limited if you made the skyscale true flight because I either have to use the true flight or play knowing that I'm doing things worse for no actual gain. The game is made to feel worse for me whether I use it or not. Again, I wouldn't make that argument, but it is just as valid as yours.
---
Right now, you know you have to use mounts or not use mounts for no actual gain.
---
&gt; The framing is "you're making the game less fun for me by wanting the game to be a certain way".
---
I am sorry, I did not want to sound like I was framing you specifically, I meant developers are compelled by some players to limit some other players' fun.
---
You can do either dungeons or finish some other low level maps that you haven't explored. Exp gain is based on your level, not the map level.
---
The diff between Frostitute and Priestitute is Frostitute is only 1 letter removed from a banned word. And you're not allowed to circumvent the banned word list. And while Priestitute is only 2 letters removed, it sounds different, removing most of the associated reference. Of course i wouldn't be able to say if Maplestory had any kind of naming policy. I sure wouldn't try the name in gw2.
---
It only happened due to witch hunting and mass reporting. Single report would never cause them to look into this.
---
Just one thing here :
---
&gt; You literally just made a post about how much you love this mount, I do not think it is unreasonable to say that it is not completely ruined based on that evidence.
---
The post, orinally, is about the picture and how the skyscale helped, not about how much I love it.
---
Other than that, we're going into tastes and beliefs teritorry.
---
Dad spottet

The real J Christ was a jewish radical. If he had lived today. He'd have laughed his ass off. However, he's been dead a while now and its not the dead we're trying to not offend. They don't get a vote.
---
Yeezus Krusty
---
&gt; No, that's not what happens. Even the most recent episode, LS4E6, is an example of this.
---
What, exactly?
---
Commanders do wait for squads in trains, what are you referring to? Or did you just post to write "Stop. Your. Bullshit." one more time?
---
that would just get infracted again.
---
Yea I was thinking going that route so I can work up to stuff and not be as overwhelmed. Is there dungeon raid content pre 80? What about those level up vouchers? I have a 20/30/50/60 lvl boost. If I did use those how would I go about gearing? Just buy some cheap stuff on market ? 
---
How far does 20 gold stretch for gear? What about orange gear buying?
---
I have 160k karma too?

Whatever you say, Simon

Guess which one it is.
---
And the right to wear certain things on the head on the DMV picture.
---
Just bring HoH and GW1 from gw1 to gw2 with somme tweaks. 
---
These are stil the best team pvp (WvW being amazing in its own way) i've seen in an MMO and sPvP not being even close to either still is my biggest disappointment to date. Gw1 pvp mechanics with gw2 combat, just grrrrr
---
Other classes combos can pump out the same boons without relying on chrono vs chrono only able to pump out alac/quick while relying on the rest the support classes making chrono unnecessary especially when other classes provide MORE damage, cc, unique offensive and defensive buffs. The ONLY thing chrono offers is more blocks/evades for tanking which ISN'T used at all in fractals and 90% of bosses you dont really need in raids (exceptions being largos and sh). Ps new soi FEELS like shit, theres no PERSONAL impact.
---
You're asking for completely optional cosmetic items to be given to you for free in a non-subscription game which has a ridiculously low price-barrier for entry, zero pay-to-win elements and has already given a crap-ton of free content over 7 YEARS OF OPERATION.
---
Yes, I do presume that you're a cheap bastard who would rather whine about not getting everything for free than actually go and earn enough money to pay for the things you want. 
---
I think you clearly should be spending your time on more important things than a video game, if that makes me "presumptuous" then that's fine with me.
---
Then do it until then.
---
over time, rules change. Go figure.
---
Sorry, I already took the alternative "Jeebus Crisp" :S
---
its annoying that your name isnt Culminacio
---
He was a Jew from the middle east. What did you think he looked like? Like he came from Scandinavia?
---
All depends on whether or not the name gets reported. When I was a dumb teenager playing gw1 I had an ele named humping rocks. Someone angry messaged me to delete the character and I said no since I put hundreds of hours into that character. Next day I had a 72 hour ban and forced name change.
---
Maybe the opportunity to upgrade it into one
---
Well I know some people who have upgraded their PCs but still want to stick to win7 for various reasons so that's not given.
---
i5-7400, GTX1070ti, 16gb ram
---
&gt; I have no counter arguments, cannot snoop through your post history to find a distraction to this and so will pretend having a new account is a valid excuse to dismiss your arguments. 
---
FTFY, coward.
---
Nope, but it does get reposted by karma-whores
---
For desktop YouTube I'd definitely prefer Linux, browsers work almost perfectly and using MPV is much simpler than on Windows. 
---
For gaming it isn't quite there yet, especially for MMOs where performance isn't great to begin with, but if WINE w/ D9VK continues to make progress, it could become a viable alternative to Windows with D912pxy.
---
What gave me away? blinks innocently
---
Yes, I said the money is significant for me. I don't see why that has anything to do with my views as a Veteran, or stepping away from daily content creation. I'm still entitled to *cast* a day a month, for the PvP community that exists, because they get nothing else. If that benefits my ArenaNet Partnership then that's a positive for me.
---
Again, you're proving your own stupidity trying to prove hypocrisy which doesn't exist.
---
Sure but it's not like he had it for 4 years when he wasn't supposed to.
---
They could have changed their policy back last week.
---
The map was built for mounts. What is even your point?
---
"touch the bot"
---
&gt; I changed the colors a little bit after I ordered the picture
---
...ah, that would explain the silver metal parts on the screenshot up there.
---
I have no problem with people being critical but when people are just copy pasting the exact same post with a different titel just because its the fotm, at that point no. People should just shut up and quit the game, what ever game that may be.
---
You changed the H in to an N, turning it into a sexual reference. And coming up with names isn't hard. In my 7 years and 26 toons, not one ever got flagged or had a "name taken" come up. The trick is https://www.behindthename.com/ find a name meaning what you want to reference without it actually being a curse word. For last names you can try the race naming convention. Even Asura aren't hard, put a profession in front of the wanted name and done. Ya just need to be less punny and more actually creative.
---
Upgrading your equipment is a good start.  If you're a F2P player, your trading post prowess is a bit limited, but you can check on there for level-appropriate gear and buy some if it's not too expensive, it will make a big difference.
---
The better solution, though, would be to just go somewhere else.  You don't need to fight in zones of your level to gain XP.  You will gain more XP there, but the difference is pretty minor, and there are level 40-50 zones and other level 50-60 zones (even a 55-65 one) for you to check out.  You can even go all the way back to a 1-15 zone and still progress there.  At higher levels, it's rare for a single zone to carry you all the way through its level spread just on its own, so exploring a couple of different zones is usually the way to go.
---
Don't worry, you'll be level 80 soon enough, and then doing zones in a specific order goes out the window, you'll be able to go wherever you want and do whatever you want!
---
Cept such things are officially announced. and no, a reddit dev post does not count as officially announced.
---
Stop whining about them. Leave the reddit if you don't like it.
---
Still dont get why people even say it's dead/dying. Every area I go into has a lot of people doing stuff.
---
True story. my kid won't upgrade her laptop... lol
---
Yeah, I have a 1TB external that I threw Linux on... Internal SSD has Win10.  When I wanna go on Linux, I just reboot via USB drive lol
---
Not really, this is basic customer service. If I got anything less than this I'd be pissed at Anet's CS team.
---
Wow, Xar. Great moves, keep it up, proud of you.
---
Yeah you're right, my bad. Still a silly thing to enforce
---
&gt; If you're not a game developer, I'm sure I understand the entire  software/game development process from requirement building to shipping a  product much more than you do. 
---
I'm a software engineer. Not in the game industry, but I'm friends with a few game devs both in small studios and indie. Take that as you see fit.
---
&gt; See my other reply.  Apparently I have to spell it out for reddit "ANET,  Hire more devs and less artists.  Get your playerbase back and then the  microtransaction profits will happen" 
---
I haven't seen your other reply, so I only replied based on what your original comment was.
---
strange, i just record with shadowplay ingame settings (high quality) and use vsdc free video editor to put it on slow motion. i even can reduce it to 10% speed (means very very slow) without any freeze or framedrops. maybe i do it accidently right lol
---
Installed this (clean install) and I noticed some odd behaviour while doing Frozen Maw/Shaman. Once the Shaman himself started attacking, fps dropped to about 25 or so. After a minute it suddenly shot up to 80, even though by that point *more* players are piled in and the screen was busier than before.  
---
I can't say I've noticed it with other events or with the Shaman a couple of days ago before this update. Any ideas? It's not a problem per se as that event isn't one I bother with a lot and it's not like fps matters for it, but it's *consistently* happened every time I've done *that specific event* in the last 48 hours so I'm thinking there might be some kind of error going on.
---
Skill capturing is/was a fun way to add meaningful horizontal progression to the game. GW2 has this to some extent with elite specs and masteries, but they have missed the mark for me, as they aren't that the repeatable, the gameplay/acquisition isn't as compelling and it's much less a part of the gameplay experience (short lived).
---
Also I prefer the mission and campaign structure of gw1 with normal and hardmodes as it gives a   better experience gameplay experience than GW2 story instances.
---
Wtf are you even talking about?. The fuck is wrong with you?
---
Did you really delete him? D:
---
I replied to this in case you forgot.
---
"Ok, 14 comment karma 5 year old Reddit account. Did you really go off racing to see if you had a separate account on the mobile you use to play Final Fantasy Brave Exvius so you could bullshit on it too?"
---
So, what is your point about Ls4ep6?
---
Ascalon to the Crystal Desert, including one of the desert missions! Took like an hour for each group, lol.
---
dumbass, you went on to reply some idiotic comment.
---
Because you did.
---
In that case, you should be pissed at their lack of tools, not at them (or if anything, at the oversight of the developers to have no dialogue box before account-binding something). The customer support reps having no way to simply delete an item from someone's account, remove the skin from their account, or un-account-bind an item isn't their fault, but they still put in extra effort to get around all that and go as far as logging into the user's account to remedy the situation.
---
That's not basic customer service, that's *good* customer service
---
Ask for the ticket to be escalated? I've done that before with an answer I felt was unwarranted and had my issue resolved with no fuss. Sometimes the CS guys have to stick with their policies and let a higher up make the call.
---
Build templates came out way after EotN
---
I mean all things considered the concept art field in the gaming industry largely utilizes contractors and when it doesn't the pool of talent is pretty small comparatively I'd say there is a chance it's the same person.

With that said I've seen numerous similar designs going fairly certain there is a Boris Vallejo piece out there that's similar.
---
I mean you already can fly anywhere with 0 restrictions. Exploiting though
---
GW2 cheats. Wurm throws rock(no cool down and extra long distance) at you and your toon will get hit even if your toon run half screen away from previous screen. Only doge/evade works. Forward run does work, but not backward run. So in cool down, just run forward.

This is just to show speed is meanless to bosses.

Definitely much more mild than what I’d originally opted for which was obviously not allowed...

Weekly reset happened last night so it will take a day for these stats to populate again.  This shows when the most active time for each server is.   These are all the HOST servers.  Ruins of  Surmia is currently paired with Abaddon's Mouth.  So you can look at that server for all the statistics.

Most people I know and myself, when we say the game is dead, it's because the end game has been the same for 3+ years with little to no change. And the changes they make, such as random fractal instabilities, make the end game even worse.   
---
Raids are easy and are released like once every 8 months (at least they were the last I played). The only end game left in raids is pushing for records just to push for 1-2 seconds off the current record. My first clear of wing 6 was selling the wing to someone, just shows how boring raids in this game have become. This gets boring very quickly.    
---
Most "Veterans" will agree that fractals were at their best before the introduction of random fractal instabilities. This update was the last straw for a lot of hardcore players, and refused to do fractals anymore. And those who continued to do them, continuously complained and straight up were not having any fun doing them.    
---
Open World is Open World, it's fun content if you don't care about fun, instanced content. Most hardcore/veteran players would rather afk in the Sanctuary than run around auto attacking a world boss.    
---
Also, Anet's obsession to lowering the skill cap of classes/builds (RIP Distortion, old Condi Druid, weapon stowing Warrior axe autos, etc), even makes playing the little content they have left in this game, boring.    
---
The game might have an active player base, but the veterans/hardcore players are sick of the game being easy/made even easier. GW2 is not an MMO for players that want a fun and engaging end game. It is a game that introduces new people to their first MMO, and hopes that they buy something from the Gemstore before they get sick of the game.
---
It helped when I chose my envoy armor with the wrong stats to get it swapped. They probably just did it because I buy like $400 of gems a month.

No. GvG if they ever implement it would hopefully be 15v15. And why shrink standard ranked to 3v3?
---
You can try any character without boosting. When you go to the PvP lobby your characters skills are temporarily boosted to lvl 80 and you can try any of them out with any weapon
---
true enough; I was merely attempting to provide a framework for the Ascalon/Rurik narrative; but then again; The Shiverpeaks is right next to Ascalon; so a 50/50 map could work (especially if Jormag is _expanding_ into Charr Territory.
---
Oh so a PvP video without 5 minute long intro + stupidly loud music in addition to lots of "power point" effects! That was entertaining to watch!
---
I cast Blue-Eyes, Republican Jesus!
---
&gt; and even hundreds of people barely make up 1% of the playerbase
---
And these are only the ones posting, if you could count everyone in favor of infinite flight, it may well go into majority.
---
&gt; No, just simply go play a game that has infinite flight instead of demanding it in other games.
---
Again, tell that to the dozens/hundreds of players requesting infinite flight.
---
Lol *strokes the salty internet*. The emotional response to replies. You must play PvP.
---
Also confused at that one. It's probably quite commonly used too.
---
Well, that's something awful, isn't it.
---
Judging from what I found looking around online, the player with the "Jesus Christ" character apparently got dinged for 4 other names as well all at the same time.
---
https://imgur.com/DpeUwWK
---
&gt;How many times have you had to argue to keep the name now? I feel like we need a running ticker.
---
That's a good question your buddy asks. How many times have you been dinged for that character name?
---
&gt;Can you imagine someone hating fun so much they'd go and report Jesus Christ, the legendary holysmith? **I hope some kind of Super GM will overturn this again.**
---
Your other buddy is probably right. If it was any player other than a member of [SFD], we'd have no chance to get a naming policy violation overturned.
---
&gt; Just like you're not allowed to name your character after NPCs
---
Really? 
---
This is abit ridiculous...
---
I appreciate that advice. If you got any lowbie toons you wanna play I’d love the company since you just came back too. Pm me
---
I wonder if Jesus Christoph would be alright? Jesus is a common first name around here, "heh-soos" pronunciation. Christoff is a legitimate surname. I mean, Chris and Christian are both (obvious) references to Jesus Christ, and many names are biblical references. I don't understand attempting to censor religious reference names, as many everyday names are just that.
---
I've looked at one of your videos and vsdc appears to be using frame sampling for slowing down video:
---
Let's say these are 5 frames you've recorded at 60FPS:
---
    AA BB CC DD EE
---
And you slow it down to 50% with frame sampling this is what happens:
---
    AA AA BB BB CC CC DD DD EE
---
It repeats the same frames 2 times in a row which works but means you're only seeing 30 unique frames a second in a 60 FPS timeline.
---
Frame blending and motion flow do things a bit different and try to interpolate (fill in the blanks) between frames so in this case you'll get:
---
     AA AB BB BC CC CD DD DE EE
---
Which will give you 60 unique frames without repetition.
---
You can slow down footage in exactly the same way as in vsdc by giving it a percentage value but I'm getting better results by setting a fixed frame rate to the files instead.
---
I don't use action camera, so I was not aware of that. It does sound problematic.
---
Monte H  Cristo
---
You have to be a certain level on one character to unlock it but I forget. Maybe lvl 10 or something 
---
After that you can do it on any lvl 2 character (just finish the intro)

---
yeah i was gunna wait till then anyway
---
I simply mean I'd like it to be a chance of winning the blitz or losing. Not a guaranteed gold by joining an lfg or a guaranteed bronze by not joining one. I'd like to meet up with some mates, give the blitz a few tries learn what we need to do to beat it and go about doing that, some kind of curve besides simply joining an lfg to beat it in the most efficient way
---
TIL there's a whole wiki about a gw2 character player O,o
---
Yeahhhh I'm gonna disagree on that. Getting into groups was never really that bad. Maybe you were playing on a bad timezone, but I remember internation dist 1 always having at least one low rank group forming up. Hell, I never really got to that high of a rank, but I could generally join r6-7+ groups by just saying "hey i'm only r3 but I'm not a shitter will join vent etc" and they'd just say sure.

hope its greatsword elite spec for revenant and new WvW system announced xD

So your account had GM permissions for a moment, and then it got disabled again to a normal account (the part of GM magic). I hope that you don't start seeing weird things lol.

---
“The skyscale allows us to view some content better”
---
Where is the word “only” in that statement? Claiming you can do something with X is not mutually exclusive with other means to achieve it.
---
&gt; Honestly, I see pretty much no one advocating infinite flight in this game.
---
You did not look.
---
&gt; such selfishness
---
What selfishness? That I do not like other players telling me how to play the game?
---
&gt; But it never occurs to you that it's **you** that wants to take that fun away from me
---
Oh, it never occurs? Then why did I kept replying with "simply do not use the mount" - which can be easily manipulated into "simply do not fly infinitely"? There is *nobody* stopping you from plotting any route, only those (apparently including you) that present the "selfishness" to **completely** take the fun away from others. Instead of doing the \*gasp\* huge effort of not pushing a button to fly infinitely, sure, why not go ahead and prevent all players from **any** possibility of flight according to their style of playing the game?
---
Thanks but I already knew about that. I was thinking of something like 50% off both, it happened in the past. Something like $25 for both. Or any sale other than the standard $10 savings by buying the bundle.

Currently a new F2P player  how to unlock trading at the black lion company? Currently I can't hold many things and am trying to craft a backpack or something to carry more items and be able to sell more of the items I currently own. But it says my account needs to be 4 days or older and can't be f2p.
---
Do I have to purchase the game? Or can I get away with purchasing the path of fire expansion for $20 from dlgamers? Is there a cheaper place I can get the game or expansion? 
---
If all I want to do is not have my inventory super restricted is the best way to do this to buy the game or expansion?
---
I currently own the starter backpack, and 2 leather pouches to store stuff, and I'm also selling stuff on the black lion trading market, selling junk, and holding additional items in the bank. I just never seem to have enough inventory space.

Thanks a lot! I can already tell the community here is great :)

So, any grown man can understand why a post like this shouldn't be at the top of RGW2 or have lasted 14 hours. There are Christians who play the game and running around mocking Him is incredibly offensive. It would would be like making a white character named KKKlan with a white hood or naming yourself any other religious figure such as Buddah.
---
Believing in unprovable atheism doesn't mean you should act like an idiot to those who believe otherwise. It just makes you look like a fool. If you believe evolution or other brainwashing techniques to be undeniable truth and complete fact because you were told so, then you need to do your homework.

So much you asked him to change his character name :D
---
"YOUR OPINION IS DIFFERENT THAN MINE REEEEE"
---
I agree. I was pretty disappointed when GW2 came out and the pool of skills was tied to individual weapons. The thing I liked most about GW1 was making janky creative builds with the plethora of skills available.
---
Well you don't have to use the PvP lobby, but you can if you want to mess with your Build, but that game mode has a different Balance than PvE &amp; WvW (These game modes have different Skill Balance, stronger in X content and nerfed or changed in X content).

---
&gt; Then why did I kept replying with "simply do not use the mount" - which can be easily manipulated into "simply do not fly infinitely"? 
---
That's a bullshit argument and we both know it. You're demanding others to force limitations on themselves just so you can have your fun. That's selfish as fuck. Games are for entertainment, to relax and unwind, not to go out of our way to keep the illusion of once good game mechanics, just so some random fuckboy can have a bit more fun for a while.
---
As for why you keep replying with the same crap, that's anyone's guess. It doesn't become less shitty after repeating it three times, I can tell you that.
---
How many more times is this going to be posted?

Hey everyone, I played this game when it first released after pre-ordering and played for around a year. Since the I know the game went free and there have been a lot of updates.
---
I played the game through to a short while after the first major live event of the island with the giant crab things on but I don't remember much about the game and would like to know what's happened in terms of updates since I left.
---
Also, were any benefits provided to players who purchased the game before it went free to play? I doubt much but it's worth checking
---
Thanks for the help
---
I just picked it up again, and it's just as good as I remember. The world feels a lot more immersive than GW2, maybe it's because of the instanced zones and not seeing particle effect bombs flying past on space birds all the time, but I think it's more than that. I love just hanging out in Kaineng Center or Shing Jea Monastery (those background bells and faint music, it takes me back years to when Factions first came out).
---
I love the depth in the team building! Even if you're playing completely solo, there's 8 team members to get classes, skills, equipment, attribute points for, it's RPG at its finest, and there's the option to group up with others and synergise your builds to fill roles in the team.
---
My favourite classes that never made it to GW2; paragon, ritualist and dervish. I wish more than anything they had not given mesmers the illusion mechanic and instead given the same thing to a new ritualist class (skills spawning types of spirits, but only three allowed at once). It would fit the playstyle exactly. With a Communing specialisation that focused on spirit summoning, Channelling for direct damage, Restoration focusing on support/defense, etc. The ranged spear and shield wielding paragon with their chants that briefly gave you big golden wings wouldn't even look that out of place now they put huge cosmetic bird wing backpieces in the cash shop.
---
How so? That's repeatedly breaking the rules.
---
It's a perfectly formed rule for someone who needs to exercise authority needlessly since almost any name anywhere will have been inspired by some culture's religions, legends/myths or historical figures.  They don't even need to redefine words to make it happen!
---
Someone else said it's the same in German in the comments up there.
---
You're just blaming the world for your own lack of self control.
---
&gt; would like to know what's happened in terms of updates since I left.
---
That's...a lot to unpack
---
2 expansions, 3 living world seasons since then, mastery system, mounts, gliding, elite specializations, fractal updates, raids, overhaul of the trait system, 1 new profession

Kind of. You got to play your character for longer, you don't have the f2p restrictions even without expansions, and your longest lasting characters have birthday gifts waiting for them.
---

Your post is the third one that I've seen. The other ones have been deleted I assume by mods under the "don't stir drama" rule.

I really like watching Teapots streams but these posts stopped being funny a long time ago, are now becoming plain annoying and cast an actual negative (not elitist, actual negative) shade on Teapot's stream and upcoming tournament.

Yes yes sorry I deleted them. Reddit bugged and posts didn't appear. All three posts with rude answers like yours just by a mistake I made... Thanks for saying.
---
Looks like the name says Jadexi, but he wasn't talking about his balls, so I can't quite tell.
---
Yeah, waypoints hurt the early game far more than mounts in the first place. They started reducing their numbers during LW2, but then they introduced mounts and we're back to the beginning.
---
If you want people to walk instead of run past, then just make the world interesting. If people feels like skipping everything, maybe it's because it's just trash not worth the attention in the first place.
---
Honest advise is not to play WvW until Alliance update happens. Even most populated EU servers struggle to have full squads atm, and it had been declining ever since PoF/pip update came out 2 years ago. And constant bitching getting only worse.
---
**Body block**, GW2 is ducking arcade.
---
Honestly, being able to choose what weapon skills I wanted to take for each weapon. Flatbow and exploding arrows were my love in GW1. Longbow Ranger in GW2 just got stale after the first several months, to the point where I switched to Shortbow even before the condition cap was increased from 25 stacks.
---
Indulging in nostalgia a bit more, I miss pet charming in GW1. There was a long animation where you had to keep focus with your (future) companion, otherwise it'd get interrupted and you'd have to get annoyed and start again. There was a real sense of a bond being created when you succeeded, not just yoinking some animal and saying "you're mine now".
---
&gt; No, it's not. That's how humans work.
---
Humans with lack of self control, you must mean.
---
Next thing you know drugs, gambling, and crime are society's fault, and the individual is just a victim.
---
&gt;You got to play your character for longer
---
That's all I expected honestly but anything else is great. 
---
As for all those other updates I think I'm going to have a lot of work to work out what I missed. I had a maxed elementalist that was working towards bifrost and I think I was also working on the short dungeon things in the main city to get my levels up or something about corruption?
---
Thanks for the link, I'll start there and make a new character to get back in to it.
---
I couldn't care less even if I tried - not going to waste my time and energy on some random internet discussion unless I feel like it, and today I don't.  
---
Also, I didn't ignore the rest of your post. I understand the greed behind such decisions. I disagree with your take on it, but I don't care enough to try and discuss such complicated issue here.

Nah im enjoying it still, and im working towards getting the mistforged obsidian weapons

Would high res character textures affect the fps?

As much as i despise SWTOR, their pvp modes were hella fun.

Games Like Huttball (basically american football with acid pits and fire traps.
---
Voidstar - a mode where you had to plant bombs on doors while the other team tried to defend them.
---
GW2 pvp ive played a lot in the past and never touch it now, it just seems far too serious and boring.
---
Bring in new game modes please, make pvp fun and stop worrying about esports
---
Thanks will watch that later!
---
&gt; Think about WvW now that the warclaw is out. I could choose not to use the warclaw, because I don't like it. What happens: I can't keep up with zergs, I can't run from those who use the mount, I have little chance to kill someone on a mount. People will use the better option whether they like it or not because they have to in order to keep up with the game.
---
The problem there isn't the mount itself, but the fact that there's no solid competitive alternative.
---
If basic crowd control could dismount the rider and deal him a lot of damage, the warclaw wouldn't be that good. The same way, if walking in PvE had resource benefits you'd miss by flying, you'd not abuse flying that much.
---

You can get a full set for about 10 gold, which won't take long to farm if you don't have it.

Inventory space is a concern for F2P players.  With that said, there's one thing that might be able to help you.
---
At the top-right of your inventory is a gear icon.  Clicking it will open several options, one of which is "Deposit All Collectibles".  By clicking that, all your crafting materials in your inventory will be sent to a special Materials tab in your bank that holds 250 of each of those materials.  This is a great way to cut down clutter, and the deposit can be done from anywhere in the world.
---
If you do buy one or both of the expansions (be it from Arenanet themselves or an authorized retailer like DLGamer... don't buy it from the grey market or you put your account at risk), not only will those trading post restrictions be lifted after a few days, but you'll also get two extra bag slots on each character for a total of five (and three more character slots, too, also for a total of five).  That will help your immediate inventory concerns!
---

Thanks! But i think ill manage. I have played most of the mmos and im quick learner. :)
---
The other response covered things pretty well, but I'll chip in to remind you not to delete your older characters.  The birthday gifts have goodies inside, and will continue to give you more goodies as the characters age.  If you started playing immediately on release, then your first character's seventh birthday is coming up in just a couple of weeks.  If you delete your old characters, then you have to start at the bottom again with birthday gifts!
---
It is a limitation because it either forces players to use the mount abnormally, like randomly landing because it was once necessary to do so, or to not use the mount at all. 
---
I mean, how do you envision such a thing? Skyscale but with no green endurance bar? Then there's zero skill involved in terrain manipulation, because it doesn't metter how and when a player lands, it's just forceful roleplay for nostalgia's sake, with zero sense of reward.
---
But who cares as long as you can have the cake and eat it as well, right? /s
---
Interrupt gameplay was so good, GW2 CC is so boring compared to it.
---
It's quite simple - pick a name that you would not find offensive if you were a worshipper. Avoid literal / full names and perhaps vary the spelling. If you are not sure, pick a different name.
---
You're the one harrassing here though, he just shared a video.
---
Yeah I'll definitely keep them. I know I made a minimum of 2 characters that I had leveled quite far and probably a few more that I gained a few levels in.
---
&gt;Specific skins dropping only in specific areas / from specific bosses
---
Not just skins. If you wanted an item with specific stats and upgrades, you could farm specific bosses to get it.
---
&gt;The cooperative aspect of the entire game. Story (missions) being balanced around a full group of 4/6/8 players depended on the location instead of playing alone (yes, heros and henchmen are not real players but you still need a synergizing team comp)
---
I'm still baffled they ditched the cooperative mission model in exchange of shitty story instances.
---
The minions from summon madness only live for 6s, then explode using the players stats because that's how the skill works. There's no ambiguous meaning there as far as I can tell, death nova is working as advertised
---
The sense of rewards varies from person to person ...
---
Anyway, I am most likely going to stop here, because the point of this post was not to request limitless flight support.
---
I'm less worried about that, and more concerned about "Reference names of copyrighted or trademarked characters, materials, or products". Too many of my characters are named in honor of fictional characters for me to not be. Doubly so since I consider their names to be the core part of their identity.
---
It does a lot (increased loading times, uses 4 times as much texture memory on the gpu for each player) but only when there are other players to be drawn. If you have the player limit and quality turned down to lowest the texture setting doesn't impact the game as much because it won't load most of the players anyway.
---
Run into them while using warrior axe 5 or thief's dagger storm. Very satisfying.

Maybe game uses some time-stretched asset loading or there is something event specific. Dunno, any perf problems need a _pp run to see what is actually goin on.

What does adjusting the target level do? I see no changes except armor level.
---
That's one of two areas of necromancer I wish they would sit down and have a good hard look at, and hopefully some conversation about with the community. The other being staff, which hasn't really been touched since release other than some minor tweaks. I know it has its uses, but they are niche, it could be brought up to date a bit without losing the utility and flavour of the skills.
---
Death magic, and the minion traits in particular, still feel like a relic of the pre-HoT game. All of the other profession's traits that affect their utilities got them consolidated into one trait years ago, but you still have to use a whole specialization just to enhance your utility skills for necromancer.
---
Logic.

I play a good bit of sword / focus condition Weaver in spvp and was thinking about taking it roaming in WvW considering the burst is really solid. 
---
I see a lot of weavers going scepter / focus when roaming and was hoping someone with experience could point me to why that build is better for roaming than the sword/focus weaver spec.
---
I understand it does decent burst, but so much of it is telegraphed so hard. Both specs can kill pretty easily in under 5-10 seconds, just wondering other’s opinions.
---
No 2v2 ranked, there's no way Anet would be able to balance the gamemode.
---
After 7 years of balancing skills and traits around 5v5, there's no going back. You would need to rework every classes in the game to have something that would come remotely close to what you could call balance.
---
&gt;Selectable districts/shards (being able to assign a shard for RP or whatever gathering is extremely helpful, I don't know why they did away with this)

Been clamoring for the return of districts since long time ago. Would make meeting friends and people of your own language far easier than with megaservers.

It's in the skill description that one scales and one doesnt. Summon madness is locked behind a huge cd and the horrors have to live the full 6s for the damage to occur, that's why it has to scale off player stats or it wouldn't be worth using
---
Yes get mount and blaze through the base content! I’m sure that’s a great idea 💡... 
---
Many vets now hate on leveling but as a first even second third time the world was really captivating and I think using a mount to go extremely fast destroys a lot of the exploration
---
I can't confirm nor deny but that webpage is absolutely hilarious.
---
I can not figure out if this person is genuinely kind or a good actor.
---
Jesus Christ doesn't exist anymore

That is in the Wiki skill description, ingame that is not the case.

Guild missions are a decent way to get core stat accessories (like berserker). They are easy to do and give gold as well but will take a couple weeks to get (since guild missions are limited to once/week). But There are many other options like living story, fractals, various collections, etc. See more [details in this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) but usually your best shot is doing living world season 3 episode 3 or season 4 episode 6 to get trinkets (or usually both). And there are many guilds that do missions weekly (like mine) if you wanted to try and find one.
---
...oh, wow. That's impressive. And raises interest in more. "I can outrun a centaur!", for example. Can we get you to do a whole line of these? &lt;3
---
Sorry, I don’t have any money.
---
Yea we as a couple. Plenty of people say it the way I did, there’s really no need to be that petty and nit picky with it.
---
You should be able to buy them in bulk, in the upgrades tab (I think) there's a bulk buy. That's the item that will go reduced price if it's included in the anniversary sales for this month, if it indeed goes on sale. But their normal price would be 200 gems per episode, yes.
---
By Ogden’s hammer, what savings!
---
You should count the amount of times you've said "infinite flight", then.
---
1. Hearts are optional, everything will give you exp in the game. If hearts are taking too long, you can find an event nearby and completing it will give exp for heart completion.
---
2. There are multiple lvl 1-10, 11-20 maps etc. With 5 races in the game, each race has its own starting area. If you feel the map is too challenging, you can teleport to the starting zone of another race and complete that map. 
---
3. As someone said before me, you are probably trying to equip a 2H in off hand. 
---
4. Sell all junk and trophies, deposit materials and salvage gear you dont need. 
---
5. :)
---
Exactly. You can't have your hat on or a sweater's hood up in a high school class and say "it's a religious head-covering," even if it was your own religion. I don't think that would fly in most places, and you probably wouldn't have a good case for discrimination.

---
1: The thing that appears at the top-right of your screen is the Content Guide. It directs you to nearby things that you **can** do.  It should not be taken as directives, it is not telling you what you **must** do.  It provides guidance.  You can enter the Options menu by pressing F11 and change its settings or potentially disable it entirely.
---
2: If you progress in linear fashion, around level 15+ you likely will hit a spot where new things on the map are too high level for you.  That's your cue to explore a bit off the beaten path, and check out another lower level zone rather than trying to proceed in linear fashion.  All new players start with a waypoint unlocked in each race's newbie zone, so if you've finished your human newbie zone of Queensdale but Kessex Hills is too hard, feel free to waypoint to Caledon Forest or Metrica Province or Wayfarer Foothills.  You'll still gain good XP doing another 1-15 zone, and then you'll be level 20 or 22 or so by the end of it and better prepared to go all the way through a level 15-25 zone, be it the first one you found or a new one bordering the zone you just did.
---
3: Are they underwater weapons?  Comparing an underwater weapon (Spear, Harpoon Gun, Trident) to land weapons is pointless as they occupy different slots.  Similarly, if one of your weapons is off-hand only, like a Shield or Focus, you can't compare it to a main-hand weapon like an Axe or Sword.  There's no point in the comparison, they fill different slots.
---
4: Sell your trophies, salvage what you can.  Use the Deposit All Collectibles command by clicking the gear at the top-right of your inventory to store all your materials in a special Materials tab with room for 250 of all types, to save your actual bank space for more important things.

New OTP

That's strange, because as I've already stated, I did have a bone to pick. Is "telling everyone else how wrong they all are" the new way of saying someone is defending their argument?
---
"God" originally referred to the Christian (/Jewish/Islamic) deity exclusively.
---
pretty inconsiderate to text the phone number, they could've given someone else's number to annoy them etc
---
Punishing repeated offenses is cool. The rule is ridiculous. And the people who report it as well.

have you tried turning your pc off and back on?

How do you change servers? Does it cost gold or gems? and how often can you change?

Don't support resellers trading copies bought with stolen cards.
---
Well, the first thing you need is an actual build, which is a proper choice of armor and weapon stats, plus runes, sigils, traits, etc. Using the boost gear ain't gonna cut it for any kind of higher level fractals.
---
You need to decide what kind of necro you want to be, power dps or condition dps, and make a build from that. I advice you to check [Discretize's](https://discretize.eu/) and also [Snowcrows'](http://www.snowcrows.com) to check the popular builds that are currently being used by the community. These sites often go outdated due to frequent balance patches, so keeping an eye here on reddit is always good to see the latest news. 
---
Builds are always being updated as new strategies are discovered. Also, since we're talking about fractals, make sure to look for videos and/or guides that teach basic strategies for each fractal. The community has a full defined metagame for what's good and what's bad on fractals, which doesn't mean you shouldn't use the class you like. Just make sure to check how that class can help your team in each situation.
---
You might want to read up on the naming policy. But this part boils down to that you can't avoid an infraction because your name doesn't EXACTLY match the forbidden word. Mostly so players can't pull a "I'm so smart" on A-net.
---
Having watched the IT crowd, that was the first thing I tried ;)
---
the skyscale will drop faster if you press c.
---
Currently there is no decent HoT discount, but you may expect one at the end of the month/start of the next one; around the upcoming announcements. For PoF current highest discount on official retailers is on DLgamer: https://www.dlgamer.com/eu/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43768
---
I think also that one of us didn't read the games naming policy.
---
in hindsight, yeah there was an advantage to play from a bought game copy at the beginning, but in reality now depends on what content you own, hot/pof/livingworldseasons/ we are all playing the same whole game...at its core, just some players might have unlocked/and/or/bought other content like expansions/livingworldepisodes(and some lounges require passes or permanent passes)
---
You play their game, so you have to play by their rules. Not such a big leap to understand.
---
yep, its good / important knowledge to understand that :)
---
Hehe ... all those Skyscale issues is what ANet calls "Joy of Movement" ;)
---
Necros also gain life force off of deaths that don't grant experience, it would be good if death nova could trigger on anything life force came from.
---
Yes in most cases, but the maps with sickle-gathered mats are not capped (Bitterfrost Frontier, Siren's Landing and Dragonfall). I bought one to be able to powerfarm winterberries on demand, it allows me to get ~70 berries per character/run.
---
Congrats on getting this successfully resolved. And kudo's to the devs who fixed things so it COULD be fixed.
---
On the other hand bad controls is a great reason to hate underwater combat. Actually bad controls is a great reason to hate any game in general.
---
No that's perfectly fine, they have the power so they make the rules. But the rule itself is stupid. I'll follow it, but it's stupid.
---
[deleted]
---
Good job! It’s cool you were open to change the “rank” of this player’s account to force brute the removal of that weird Eternity. Clever solution!
---
god dammit
---
Wasnt there recently a thread with a pic from Augury Rock where a char named the same got to be fought as leggy? ;)
---
Oh shit you guys are still about? Ex-member here who thought the guild died a year or more ago. If Fera and Jenka are still about tell 'em Koren says hi?
---
New phone wallpaper :)
---
How about: "That's quality armor." or simply "Shiny!"?
---
hearts are really areas with activity where events, those large orange circles and escort events, usually start. if you don't care about map completion or OG legendary weapons you can pretty much ignore them.
---
Events, exploration, world bosses and even crafting will be your bigger xp gains
---
So you have the collection unlocked? If so, yes. If not, no. 
---
Tip for when you get there: advertise it on the LFG. While I was completing Spark I teamed up with someone else doing Spark and two people doing Nevermore and we took turns working through the collections together. It was quite fun and we just hammered through T1 fractals in a chilled out sorta way.
---
wtf don't resist it, DO
---
if u enjoy pvp u can easily get a good amount of tomes of knowledges, whic insantly increase you lvl by 1h
---
Agree on all points; here are a few more:
---
When dual wielding in wardrobe preview, allow showing both weapons instead of only the one that you’re currently selecting a skin for.
---
Fix the « mount into the ground » issue.
---
Allow cycling through available nearby interactable objects when pressing F.
---
Make it more than 4(?) mails before cool off period.
---
That's ones "I've attained the awesome.", according to the wiki. I can see how you'd hear it that way, though.
---
Jeez Us
---
How does this even work? I have been trying it all morning and my dps is so low. I literally die in every fight :/
---
daughter of boobs seems like something a norn would come up with tbh :p
---
Omg please do more of these- you're super talented! Love it!!
---
Are there any pvp training groups/guilds out there? I love spvp and am desperately trying to improve, but i suck. so much. And it just makes me mad when i lose EVERY single fight and discourages me from learning.
---
Wow! That's quality armour.
---
Thank you so much!
---
Do you have a link to them stating this?  or a screenshot from a support ticket saying as much?
---
I would buy a print and frame it.
---
i dont think any dev will read this without reading a TL/DR first or at least have some bullet points
---
We need someone to make a toon named Jesus Frankenstein.
---
what are this mesmer posts lately? didnt mesmers quit the game some patches ago?
---
Real question is whether you'd spend 1k gold on it :D
---
Jeezy Chreezy
---
I don't have it :[
---
How about a regular gold?
---
If you don't put this on a shirt somewhere...pls do it.
---
Thanks for the suggestion but I don't think I will do that.
---
Note to self: draw skritt holding sign 'will draw for shinies'
---
Thanks for the suggestion! Great price but not sure if the source is shady or not.
---
https://imgur.com/oVJ6z2H
---
Is that helpful? &amp; What makes you say that it starts with the ISP? I believe you because it's a horrible ISP, I just need to know what to say to them to argue my case.
---
Nice point, although that might be the case we cannot be 100% sure.
---
Thanks, I'll try to wait :)
---
That's definitely true! But it's not easy watching others with all those crazy mounts while I have to run like a peasant lol
---
Thanks for the suggestion, what's on Sept 30th?
---
Pretty much all norn female character models are more curvy and have larger breasts than human female characters.

theres always the one guy that needs to bring up politics

Been meaning to do an embroidery of this for a while now, well done :)
---
"Swift and steady!"
---
&gt;Cool, can I hire your services?
---
Yes. You pay my company, my company pays me. As it always works. You never worked (or paid for something) I asume?
---
&gt;It says 'Play for Free!' in massive letters right there on the front page.
---
I paid for GW2. Maybe you are a shoplifter and got it for free?
---
&gt;If other games offer a better value for your money then GO AND PLAY THOSE GAMES.
---
That's what most players did long ago and that's why more and more players are leaving, yes. You know what? Less players = less money for Anet = more people need to be fired. Simple basics. If Anet wants to earn money they should release content for which people are willing to pay. Simple as that. Players are no welfare organisation. Anet has to offer a product worth buying.
---
&gt;you think everything should be given to you for free 
---
Learn to read and stop bullshitting.
---
&gt;lso did you seriously just suggest that two single-player games have an equivalent amount of content to an MMO which has been running for 7 years with constant FREE updates?
---
Every free to play asia grinder offers "content for free". You can't compare high quality content as Skyrim to "kill 5000 giants" in GW2. Quality of content matters, good quality content in GW2...well, do story once, done. How many hours? 150? Do all dungeons...5 hours? Etc. Total of...200? 300? hours of content in GW2? Anything else is grind, repeatable content and therefore low effort/quality. Which is ok to some extend. MMOs need "filler content", sure. But it's not ok if a full priced expansion as HoT has only 4 maps. A 20 maps, 10 dungeons, 2 raids, 5 new fractals expansion would be a VERY different story. As GW1 expansions, as example. Back in the days people were also not complaining about a content drought weeks (!) after an expansion has hit. Expansions should keep players busy for months/years. Ideally people would now slowly run out of PoF content and start asking for LS content.
---
&gt;Citation needed.
---
In 2016, while PoF was in development: "120 devs working on live game, 70 devs on expansion 2, 30 devs on core teams that support both." Team size of Anet at that time was 400 people. http://dulfy.net/2016/03/05/gw2-reddit-developer-ama-summary/
---
Anet never again gave numbers, but since then teams have been merged, optimised, shrinked. And, unlike directly with HoT, no new expansion was announced. So at best 150 people now. Given that Anet really needs a new game: it would also be incredible stupid to not work with full power on GW3 or whatever.
---
&gt;Dude you clearly don't think GW2 is a good game.
---
GW2 SAB is the quality content. WvW is also good, but sadly got wrecked hard by Anet not caring about the mode. 
---
&gt;I'm sorry but if you're so tight on money that 30€ is such a big deal, then you have WAY more important ways to be spending your time than in a video game.
---
Has more to do with valueing the money you get. Do you also burn 30€ on a daily basis for fun? You seemed like a spoiled brat which pays with daddies money, but never had to work for his own money. https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2016/01/06/63-of-americans-dont-have-enough-savings-to-cover-a-500-emergency/
---
This is not because people earn not enough money. It's because they waste money. I know people which are constantly short on money, but always buy their overpriced, low quality starbucks garbage. Simple put: if GW2 offers only 4-5 maps for 50€: that's 50€ for like 50h of quality content. After doing story etc. you are stuck with low quality content as achievement farming. Asia grinder content you'd get for free in other games. To justify the 30-50€ price tag anet has to offer a better service than these asia grinders. 
---
Anet has to offer the same amount of quality content you'd get in other fullpriced games. Ofc it's a MMO, so quality can be a bit less than in final fantasy games or elder scrolls. Grind content as achievements is filler content. Content to keep the players active - but not the content players are willing to pay for. Simple put: no one would buy an expansion which just raises the slayer achievement cap, so you can kill more undeads and get some additional APs. People are paying for maps, story, dungeons. That's the content which has to be compared to other 50€ games. HoT maps are a lot smaller than skyrim world. It's even by far smaller than GW2 core game. Would be a different story with 20 new maps and 10 new dungeons.
---
This looks great, fancy doing a commission of my character??
---
Thanks!
---
Cool
---
anet unintentionally gimped a lot of "on kill" procs when they implemented an anti-farm measure, because of spaghetti code, when they removed xp on mobs in instanced areas, the skills wont proc.
---
wooden potatoes explains this in one of his videos on reapers onslaught
---
https://youtu.be/9whN4CCcd-0?t=1435
---
"That's quality armor."
---
"Thanks!"
---
Yeah, i totally get it. The other alternative would be to grab only path of fire for the mounts and wait for the sale on Heart of Thorns.
---
BTW File -&gt; Save Image in PingPlotter will do a nicer job of creating the graph but it doesn't matter in this case.
---
I say it starts with the ISP because all those 10.128.x.x addresses are inside the [class C private network range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_network#Private_IPv4_addresses) but even without knowing or caring about that the average for the second hop is already a big giveaway. At 521 it is around twice the ping I would get if I were playing on an EU server(I am in the US) but there an ocean between me and the EU servers.  Presumably there isn't one between you and your ISP ... unless you are actually using a satellite connection?
---
"hey Dev coworkers, people is having too much fun with this. And the farming is way to enjoyable. Let's make it more annoying"
---
Yeah, I don’t know much but your new you got base game plus 2 xpac you got time my friend
---
Sure but you veterans would like to see something new too right? :)
---
I’m not a vet I just play when I’m bored tbh but I keep up with info just to stay informed
---
Have a good one mate, Im outa this convo.
---
New name : Biggus Dickus
---
Ain't my theory. My theory is she took it to Beigarth.
---
But the thought of that line referring to Magdaer has crossed my mind because poot twists like that would be par the course for GW2 level writing.
---
Jormag is still recovering. It's not expanding anywhere.
---
I like it as is, keeps the design tighter.
---
Huh, Starfleet Dental, didn't know you guys played stuff other than Star Trek Online.
---
I appreciate your guild's unique characters and recreations, I just wasn't thrilled with how they handled Leonard Nimoy's in-game vigil with the party poppers and glitching into the fountain on Vulcan.
---
Participants were chosen from certain raiding guilds that entered awhile back. It's a bit late to try and enter now and sadly their likely won't be one next year unless anet really steps up supporting the raiding scene
---
Cool, is this your first?
---
But for real now , how is this offensive to anyone, while Odin, Athena, Anubis or Joe Pesci is fine ? What if i believe in Joe Pesci, should that make that name forbidden ingame ?
---
Its just fuken name of some random hippy dude who got really high at som point in time and had nice story telling skills, jesus christ ........
---
What do you mean by "why"?   =)
---
Chill spam them if you can.
---
Otherwise, they’re prettysimilar to old bunker chrono or bunker druid or even bunker scrapper in that they never fucking die but the less they die the more useless they become. Full minstrel weaver might look op because it spams dodges and riptide and cant die but it also does 0 damage and is extremely vulnerable when evade cooldowns are down.
---
That might be a problem with the laptop or the router.
---
40ms is still higher that what I would get while pinging the servers which should several states away.
---
You could try pinging the router. That should give results in the single digit range.
---
If you are using wifi have you tried moving around? Stuff inside walls can sometimes interfere with wifi signals. If this is a new problem that popped up check your windows update history. Maybe a driver got updated and there is a bug. There is also the new win 10 build(1903) that is rolling out.
---
So basically you just troll around then, gotcha. "I'll say what i want but i won't hear anything in return."
---
I'll let you sleep on the question who acts like an "edgy teen." Cya around.
---
Both of those are hidden until unlocked so they should be fine. The beetle on the other hand ...
---
I'll run it through a converter and see if I can get something half decent :)
---
Does the beetle has timegate or gold sink? Its been a long time 😅
---
Question for the raiders.
---
Suddenly i felt the need to start playing support roles in raids. How good / bad is tank firebrand? Is it just better to take a chronotank instead? 
---
How would a good build look? with defensive gear and offensive gear.
---
He has the right to feel offended and to report . I have the right to be offended by his action and judge him any way I want. You can't have it both ways by asserting his right to be offended and then come back and tell me I have no right to do the same.
---
i brushed off the original report posted because when i looked at the picture it wasn't even close to the JC we know from the movies. it really is far off base maybe that's why it got reported.
---
that would have been a good slogan for the people of Flint, Michigan
---
Leave jesus alone!
---
Not that I recall but you do need to do some events. One of them is on a 2 hour schedule.
---
I support all of those proposed changes 100%.
---
100% chance we won't see any of them, because even delegating *one* person to sloooowly implement them would be taking away that person from making gemstore skins and outfits.
---
Make legendary weapons and sell them.  You can, in fact get stuff you want for free.  The richest player in the game has like 1.5 million in liquid assets and doesn't farm at all.
---
Is this a sonic OC?
---
Event is not active because there's no champions untied to meta (read fuckhuge or convoluted timers) in those maps. Silverwastes technically has one but decide for yourself if it's excluded because
---
1. Tied to beetle unlock
---
2. Used to be a veteran and anet being anet """forgot""".
---
Tengu and Kodan yes!
---
God is also called Yahweh, at least in the old testament.
---
They like to pick and choose what to believe in.
---
Ik, still working on my art, but it’s of my toon so the clothes do, that is if u see my toon
---
Definitely!
---
I love it, great work!
---
Yeah!! It’s hidden at the bottom let’s bring it up bois
---
With arc in the right place, is it that you are able to load gw2 but arcdps doesn't appear, or are you unable to load gw2 at all?
---
Thx for checking. I can put it down on my list now.
---
chrono is overnerfed asf,but still playable,we just need to remove FB cancer,which is basicly chaos chrono before nerf + heals.

&gt; Reference names of copyrighted or trademarked characters, materials, or products  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; In addition, if a name is found to violate a third party’s proprietary rights and the rights holder complains about its use, we will not allow the name.
---
Odd. I've seen a million pun or straight-from-source character names. The fact this is an actual rule confuses me in all honesty. Could ANet or a player actually realistically be sued for using a character name? I mean, can you imagine getting a cease and desist for a  virtual name? Surely this is protected under consumer rights.
---
Maybe they just want players to be inventive and original with their characters...
---
Religious zealots also have a lot of money. Sure it's fine for the rest of us, but the company that makes these games can't make more games without it, and that leaves us worse off.
---
Stop buying anet games. Make bad PR. If you haven't noticed, religious people have a lot of influence. Especially with parents, who now aren't gonna buy their kids GW2 because their pastor said it was blasmphemous.
---
I love this! My husband and I always laugh when my norn randomly yells "I am awesome!" and "I like it!"
