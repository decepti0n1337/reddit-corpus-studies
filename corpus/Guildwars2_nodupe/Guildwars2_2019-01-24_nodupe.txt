Well, charr also call humans 'mice' so, judging by how offended asura commanders are by that line, it's probably just another insult.

Look for [these](https://i.imgur.com/0KRYtVz.png) icons in your Hero Panel -&gt; Achievements. It means there are achievements in that category that give you mastery points for whatever expansion (Core (red), HoT (green), PoF (purple))
---
So you clearly don't understand the mechanics behind what's going on.
---

---
Don't comment on things you don't understand.
---
Griffon is so gracious
---
I started using it a couple weeks ago and I love it.
---
Only thing I'd like to suggest is adding an option to ignore the GW2Mounts hotkey while you're typing in chat.
---
I like to use a single hotkey for my mounts so I unbound the in-game one and only use GW2Mounts to trigger my 'x' mount key. I also leave the deadzone set to my favorite mount to mimic the behavior of pressing the default in-game mount key.
---
The problem is that every time I'm typing on chat and press my GW2Mounts hotkey (x), it inputs on my chat the actual favorite mount binding (which is my '=' key, for my Jackal). So every time I type 'x' in the game chat, it outputs to 'x=' and it's annoying as heck.
---
A chat detection method and an option to disable the mount hotkey while chat is on would be great. 
---
Other than that, the only issue I have is that sometimes when I'm moving with either the left or right mouse button held on (to adjust the camera), pressing 'x' will not summon my favorite mount, but instead it will bring the one facing the last position my cursor was at before I held down the left/right mouse button.
---
I'd rather have a fractal of them.
---
I usuallly tell them that the entire game, all six years of it, is available for about six months of fees from a sub game, and since it's not pay to win that's all you'll ever have to pay to not be locked out of content.
---
What kinda potato are you playing on lol
---
I second the recommendation to go Shortbow/Shortbow Soulbeast.
---
It’s condition damage, and ascended Vipers gear isn’t the cheapest to get, but trinkets should be fairly easy with living season 3 maps (Bloodstone Fen, Ember Bay, Bitterfrost Frontier, Lake Doric, Draconis Mons, and Siren’s Landing). You can use any cheap exotic armor with condition damage while you save up. Throw on some Krait runes for bleeding duration and your preferred condi sigils. 
---
The Skirmishing and Wilderness Survival traitlines give you access to stuff that helps you survive in longer encounters while still doing nice damage. I tend to favor stances such as One Wolf Pack, Vulture Stance, and Moa Stance. Sharpened Edges for more damage. Dolyak Stance for defense. Merge with a condi pet, such as Lynx or Warthog. Warthog merged skills include a CC if you need it, and you can also use your 5th weapon skill and maybe Entangle for more CC. Your 2nd and 4h weapon skills should be used off cooldown. 
---
It makes a lot of content easier in my opinion. 
---
It honestly would be better if people like you only talked for themselves. If you're stupid, it doesn't mean that everyone around is too.
---
Precision Blade has got to be the most stupid achievement this company ever came up with. I have to make a new character fully equiped with a specific spec just for 5 AP. God.
---
Turn this upside down and you've got the Incredibles logo!
---
One of my favorite moments from that was getting all the way to the top with my partner and doing a costume brawl at the top...only to be feared off the edge by a costume brawl skill. Epic fail. It was great.
---
Singaporean here, can confirm on the ping spikes. We never get good pings in any games anyway :(
---
Introducing... the Bog
---
Yeah, and people don't seem to realize the danger here. These little bastards multiply fast. That's why the other week I made a guild for my Engi called "Asura Pest Control \[VRMN\]" to finally do something about this rodent infestation we have across all of Tyria. It's completely out of control and especially bad in Divinity's Reach. TINY little rodents running around everywhere! 
---
I did it to save the children, and the orphans. 
---
I'm currently working with the fine folks in Amnoon to negotiate trade contracts for the rats we don't burn on sight. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
At least that's pretty obviously a joke. Maybe there's some terribly clever sand pun we're not getting and Anet is just laughing at our collective whoooosh.
---
Lol I just read your name. I am glad your looking in to fixing this for us all from the post i read earlier on reddit I had kinda of got the impression you had had enough. If you actually watched my video you can see I still have the LB shortcut waiting in hope on my desktop  lol x 
---
But I'm not going to lie I only run LB when I want to multibox I'm just used to having the shortcuts there that I can move around a little so I know which I have done .... Maybe add a last logged in hehe 
---
This has been my push from the start. I really, really want, if nothing else, a Marionette fractal.
---
Buy daily envelopes + do Lunar Festival dailies. If you can get &gt;800% magic find, open them, if you can't sell the rare ones, and open the blue ones at the highest magic find you can achieve.
---
I don't agree. I think it could've been given longevity by making the event maps permanent additions. They're already doing that with areas like those in season...three? The ones with special currency. Only instead of new areas they'd be mistlocked versions of maps affected. A "present day" map and an echo.
---
Unfortunately, their design philosophies at the time also tended to be "if this doesn't work, discard it. Fuck iteration."

You can't preview the box' contents from the key.

okey thanks, did overlook it
---
You mean buy divine lucky envelopes and sell them on the TP unless you have &gt;800% magic find?
---
They come in different rarities? Or did I misunderstand what you mean by “sell the rare ones and open the blue ones”?
---
This, a hundred percent. Unfortunately, they tended to throw things away when they didn't work exactly as they hoped rather than refine them, which is why we don't have dungeons (fractals instead), WvW has no orbs, we don't have dedicated servers with inter-map affects, and the town clothes got replaced with Outfits.
---
Couldn't you just open the Gem Store and right click to preview it there any time though?
---
Nice, I just got into using Launchbuddy... Huge bummer
---
Oh, awesome! That symbol does look familiar but I never knew the story behind them. Though maybe not a mystery, it definitely could use more documentation! Thanks for this!
---
Is a protection focused Guardian worth it (ie trying to keep Aegis and Protection up as long as possible on self and allies) or is it better to go with a more generalized support build?
---
I’ve been leveling a guardian focusing on shields and virtues and right now I can solo most champions (although dps is sub par). I’m wondering if this is viable long term.
---
The divine lucky envelopes from the vendor for 1G sell for ~1.5G so you make a profit of almost 30s for each one. If you can get a decent amount of [magic find](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_Find). Silverwastes buff alone goes to 200%, lunar 15%, 40% food, 30% utility, 15% banner, 10% guild, 20% amulet, 10% fireworks means that even without boosters you should be at 340% + account bonus (up to 300%) and then up to another 300% of boosters. So if you can get high magic find, save them and use boosters in silverwastes. If you can't or don't want to you can sell them. Guild hall also has another 3/day you can get with guild coms. The [divine lucky envelopes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Divine_Lucky_Envelope) are the rare (yellow) ones. You can see [all the kinds here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lucky_Envelope). And the blue ones you get from daily and race rewards are the [little lucky envelopes.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Little_Lucky_Envelope)

[It's Kruber time!](https://i.imgur.com/PByrf4t.png)
---
Crafting is really useful only at max level for ascended equipment and weapons. You could try and leveling a discipline alongside the leveling experience and world completion but is mostly a flavor thing since you can get more and cheaper items through drops. 
---
And now we don't have enough badges to control them
---
This was like a day ago. You're still on this? Get over it dude.
---
This is sexy! 
---
2 weeks ago, i was testing power renegade (my duo buddy testing power fb so it inspired me a lot). as we both come from wvw/spvp scene, our old raid static is off meta and i think it's very unusual but fun at the same time. Since it's like instabilities in fractals with pugs. We run very different comp and strats from time to time just having fun but also get things done is a plus. But they moved on to BDO so it's just us two now. 
---
As we trained our guild run in wing 6, a guildie brought a renegade he just finished training the hp, but he's in full zerk gears. And im a big fan of off meta, I don't want to force people running something they don't. So i saw the opportunity and passed the build i was working on to him. Everyone that is raid often tell me no. Cuz on SC site there's only condi renegade =[ so i had to go to your site to check out and feelbadman. 
---
But now with the new gears, it looks millions better and videos like these are nice. Bring something new and fresh to the table. But at the same time, i guess rip power renegade =p it's not off meta anymore. Lol. Keep up these vids. I wish you'd include prestack time
---
Given the amount of salt and posts about the changes I would think most reddit users have more than 1 account or maybe is a very vocal minority. 
---
Asura trafficking. I'm glad you found it
---
Same, I still remember Flame and Frost, when you supposingly meet Braham and Rox (I think) making no sense to me. I always did the event in the Charr 1-15 area, but that really only had me interacting with the Ascalon Ghosts there.
---
A more condensed storyline (that's still the same story as before) would be greatly appreciated as a fractal.
---
The [machined shield collection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Machined_Shield_\(achievement\)) is a separate collection that the elite spec collections just check to see if it's done. So long as it's complete you'll get credit for it when you unlock the other collection later.
---
To mess this up, they'd have to literally remove mount keybindings. Hopefully that means "never"!
---
&gt; Increased the radii of the charging crystals in the "Repel invading Branded, and kill them near the charging crystals to fill the resonance crystal" event. Creatures killed outside of the charging crystals’ radii will no longer drop loot, and Branded creatures will cease dropping loot after a certain number of kills.
---
This is a fun change. 
---
Regardless of the other comments - open inventory, top right gear, deposit all materials - inventory management at its best.
---
2FA vs social engineering, which the social engineering was a fault with their support staff. Why do we have 2FA in the first place then?
---
1) still want to continue the Shadowstone. 
---
2) What does killing the central preservers on the lower tier of the trees in DS do? 
---
it is the opposite of fun
---
&gt;Fixed a bug in which player and creature models would permanently become invisible.
---
Is this a fix to the fractal bug or is it a different invisibility bug?
---
1) Unfortunately that seems like a stalled story arc.
---
2) Could you please elaborate on that? I'm not familiar with the mystery you're describing.
---
just call it a time paradox or something
---
Somehow this reminds me of the Mortal Reminder music video
---
no more reset THK meta it seems.
---
I had a lot of crash problems with this last version of ARCDPS and Reshade. I took everything off and I haven't crashed since
---
feel by this point season 2 should be permanently discounted or made free at the very least given you get less per episode...like 100 gems each(80 each on average with the bundle.) at the very least...there also needs to be an option on the buy pages for HoT and PoF to get season 3 and 4 bundled with their respective expansions.
---
I recall somewhere "heavy stone." But I don't recall if it was eventually resolve to be Rurik's Ring or something completely different.
---
In the Final Trees with the commanders eg [Southern Blighting Tower](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Southern_Blighting_Tower) you have the main level everyone is used to with preservers and pods, but down below in lower tier of the tower there are also 3x preservers and pods. Its always been a mystery what these ones specifically achieve, ive always speculated by killing those there will be no adds on the main level. But nobody has ever tried
---
Looks good so far. First thing I noticed was the text clipping (https://i.imgur.com/uNTiym7.png), and maybe add a button to launch the game?
---
I am running this on Windows 10 Pro 64bit Version 1803 Build 17134.523

Send me a message here if you want to meet up in game and get a tour of what's going on. It can be pretty confronting if you don't have experience.
---
The [Strange Rock](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Strange_Rock) found in Ember Bay was what turned into Rurik's Ring. Is that the one?
---
I did see a Wooden Potatoes video covering some of the Wizard's Tower.  I do remember him saying it was visible from somewhere in Claw Island, and there was some more but I can't quite remember.

Yes it is a fix for the common fractal invisible bug. https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/66790/hotfix-for-invisible-player-and-creature-models#latest

Hm.  Played all gw1 and gw2 a bunch, but my guild just got old and dissolved; joined a new one but never really connected... been trying to solo most of the living stories, until I either finally get there with pugs, or give up and youtube everything... I guess I'm 2 or 3 stories behind now?  Fell off right as Mounts hit; still haven't earned one.
---
Still have the subreddit subscription, and kind of kept up with it peripherally, but for some reason, this image got me?  Real curious to see a purple tornado...
---
Suggestion:
---
when a delay is added for ''Pop-up delay'', Do not reset cursor position until the delay happens, that way typing my keybind won't move my cursor when i am, for example, typing on chat, or a mail.
---
thanks for the addon, i love it!
---
It's been so long that I dont have a reference for you, but i heard/read somewhere that killing the preservers below stops the ones above from spawning.  It's otherwise exactly the same thing, just in a different location.
---
I want to say that was mentioned on a live stream, but I am not digging through ~3 years of videos to find a 7 second sound bite &gt;&lt;
---
The harbor's watchtower plays chimes (or used to) at certain hours.  The sound it makes when you stand close was also possibly a part of it?  (That sound actually sounds A LOT like the alien ship signal at the begining of Independence Day IIRC)
---
Too bad we don't have more like this, it's so nice.
---
Three what
---
This should fix that because I had that crap happen last night too where no one would kill them near the crystal and it took almost 10 minutes to finish that part. 
---
But it's also going to be fun hearing everyone bitch and moan in map chat who was pulling that.
---
Yup. 
---
There are other portals like that in the world. Straits of Devastation has one at the southern side, and Dredgehaunt Cliffs has another at the eastern side. There might be more, I don't remember all of them.
---
They're relics from another time, when they probably had other plans for the game.
---
The only overlay I use is ReShade, I'll try disabling it and see if that works.
---
Is there a hotkey for it?
---
Season 2 of Living World can still be bought, but unfortunately, season 1 was built as temporary content, and is therefore mostly gone indefinitely. I'm pretty sure that you can also experience season 2's story by partying up with someone else, but you won't get any rewards from it.
---
As for the story of season 1, there's a 3-hour video about it on youtube. I could give you a short recap here if you want though, same for season 2.
---
About Mordremoth, his big reveal was poorly handled, but basically he is "surprise!", the 6th Elder Dragon when everyone in the core game says that there are only 5. The playerbase already knew about Mordy though, mostly through hints from the core game, but when the time came, Anet somehow botched it and it was all very hastily explained. Everyone just... knew all of the sudden.
---
I fixed the problem. My mail window was dragged ALL the way down to the bottom of my screen so I couldn't see it. Thank god I didn't get far enough to file a support ticket! lol.

Where are all the horses in Tyria?
---
Istan was too lucrative and took attention from other maps is how
---
I bet some people would pay that.  All items would need to be account bound though or else they could screw up the market obviously.
---
I probably should have provided that to begin with :) 3840x2160 with 125% scaling
---
With all the new mount masteries and good use of the mounts I think it might be possible to do it 3 times in one event, even.
---
Unfortunately that turned into a huge disappointment when it was revealed that Rockstar canceled the mystery updates in favor of shark cards and microtransactions.
---
&gt; Yeah, that's what I first imagined, but still wondered if you were aware about this 'issue'. My first thought would be trying to detect some active elements of the UI that only appear when the chat is active (such as the resize arrow), but I'm aware this still represents some issues, not to mention it would probably be hard to implement given the chat window doesn't have a fixed size.
---
The only way I could do something like this would be some kind of image recognition algorithm, and that's way too heavy when GW2 is already super CPU bound. I already wanted to do something smarter, but after I asked Chris he sided with not letting me do it because it's too close to hooking into the game. I'm afraid that particular feature, while definitely something I'd want to do, is off-limits for now.
---
As for the rest of your comment, I'm mulling it over right now. I'm not sure just how much I can fix it, but I'll certainly try to reduce the annoyance you're pointing out.
---
If after waiting 13 years to see the Wizard Tower, they only let raiders in, you will not believe how unbelievably pissed off at ArenaNet I will be.
---
I don't multi-box, and I do use `-autologin`, but sometimes the launcher locks up after the countdown. I'd use the virtual desktop option, but that causes my mouse to get locked to the right ⅔s of my screen for some reason that I assume is caused by having 3 monitors. Thanks for the advice though.

---
So I've been playing gw2 for just over a week now, and I have both expansions. I read a lot about how its a bad idea to boost your first character, so I started leveling a Warrior, and by the time I got to level 20 I decided that I would boost a Guardian to 80 so I could get the mount. Now I'm just working on leveling the warrior; I don't plan on touching the guardian again until I hit 80 naturally.
---
I'm at level 43 right now, and just did my first dungeon, Ascalonian Catacombs. It took a surprisingly long time to get a group together for, and when I got into it it seemed like everyone else knew exactly what was up, where to go, what to do, etc. while I was just utterly confused and getting 1-2 shot by traps. I know that they were getting frustrated, and I felt pretty bad.
---
I'm super excited to get into PvP, WvW, doing dungeons and everything else there is to do, but I know that I will be bad at them when I start. Before going into Ascalon, I had watched guide videos on it, but we went on a completely different path. (I watched a guide for the story mode one assuming that I would be railroaded into it on the first time through.) I didn't see any of the story after the first cutscene, because after I watched that one I realized my party members were already fighting and I didn't want to be left behind. Also, there was no clearing of trash mobs, just a every man for himself rush through tons of gravelings.
---
I can't help but feel that something similar will happen when I try out PvP for the first time. I can throw together a build from metabattle, but those are all designed for people that know what they are doing. I can't help but feel like even though I can technically play a support firebrand, I will be pretty useless. The crux of the problem is that I don't want to drag a team/party/whatever down but I do want to experience these parts of the game, because right now I only feel comfortable doing world bosses when I happen to be in the same area as one that is spawning, and that's only because no matter what I do the rest of the group will probably succeed.
---
So, I know there's a taboo against new players asking questions in this sub, but I really would love some recommendations.
---
Are there beginner-friendly(read: easy to play) PvP builds out there that might not be top tier, but are serviceable? Even better, are there any for guardians or warriors?
---
Are there resources that I'm missing that provide informative walkthroughs of dungeons, and fractals when I'm ready for them?
---
Is there a practice PvP arena for new players to bang their faces into each other until they get the hang of it?
---
Should I even be worried about WvW? On the one hand, its PvP, and I know from previous experience that that kind of environment causes the most frustration towards everything, especially underperforming teammates. On the other hand, there are so many people in there that what I do can't matter that much, right?
---
Lastly, I know that looking for a guild here is against sub rules, but is a guild the answer here, and if so how do I look for said guild?
---
I appreciate any help you all can give me. I've been having a lot of fun so far, and I really hope to be able to jump into something besides overworld PvE soon because I just can't do that forever.
---
The genie storyline in Super Adventure Box
---
I'm pretty sure there isn't a gate that denies you for not being a "raider." There are plenty of guilds and groups out there that are happy to teach people or maybe even carry them.
---
Right! I totally forgot about that one! Good call!
---
*tips crown*
---
Seems legit. 
---
I'd like to think the Golden Sand is just a reference to the area. It is after all called Pyrite Peninsula. 
---
I should point out that the Golden Sand thing appears to have been added around early 2016. Why would they add something to a base map without some kind of reason? Especially something that can be consumed but with no effect?
---
This is a huge mess. We waited so long for a fix, and they didn't think to fix it for those of us that completed that achievement? How idiotic. How else do you think the issue was reported in the first place!?
---
Could've been an idea for the original location of the Capital portals, until they were added to that nice area on the coast in old LA. Devs probably just left the old area they'd intended to use for them there under the justification that they'd be used "eventually".
---
It was either Side Stories or updates to Festivals, as it seems the same team is working on them. And people complained every.single.festival. that it was the same thing every year. So now we get festival updates, but no side stories.
---
Hopefully they fix that with alliances.  I play on a T1 server and we aren’t that great (fu bg!).  I primarily roam and have still been able to cap t3 towers dou’ing.  I cap about 20 camps a day soloing  for PIPs.  When trying for SMC or a keep it takes some dedication, but if you are having problems capping a t2/t3 tower with a tag on a regular basis then your server just isn’t into it and you should accept that.  If you want to improve your WvW game maybe you should consider a different server.
---
Sadly, I do not.  I'm sure there are a lot for items we just don't have uses for though.  There are probably some from the core game that have you bring in map specific items to create some green item that will never be discovered.
---
[This](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Mad_King) is where I first noticed it.
---
This man. He's asking the right questions!
---
Was.
---
Dungeons aren't run as often as other content so finding groups is a little slower especially at non-peak times. You can look up guides and info on them or just include that you're new in your LFG post and see if people want to help out. You can always be the one to post the LFG and open the instance on whatever path you want (but yes, story mode will be harder to find). Lots of people want to clear dungeons as fast as possible for rewards so skipping trash mobs is a must for them, though I will say it's much better to run past a lot of the harder sections there instead of trying to fight all of them. 
---
&gt;  taboo against new players asking questions in this sub
---
This is the perfect place for questions and people are happy to help. Not sure where the idea comes from that people don't like questions :(
---
I'd say any of the [bunker builds](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Firebrand_-_Mantra_Bunker) are going to be easier to learn since you stay alive a lot longer and shouldn't be burst down right away. 
---
Use the [PvP lobby](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heart_of_the_Mists) to practice in the free for all arena or on NPCs.
---
For WvW you'll want to wait till level 80, it will up level you but you'll be much weaker than normal. It also, unlike sPvP, uses your normal gear so the more regular players have specific sets and gear for WvW. Can be a lot of fun and there is a lot less pressure when running around in a large group (zerg), can even join voice coms of a commander if you want to get a better idea of what they want the group to do.
---
/r/guildrecruitment can be used to find guilds, will be especially important if you want organised WvW and less so otherwise but you should find a good group that you enjoy spending time with. 
---
Let me know if you want some more personal help or have any other questions, I'd be more than happy to hop in game and help you out!
---
&gt; Being yelled at for trying to complete an event
---
This is the one I always enjoy. I see players try to finish a event and the farmers will lose their mind and yell/berate them. That isn't good for the game.
---
go cry a river
---
which maps, and is still doesnt explain how people farming certain maps to earn cash takes away from you doing....anything
---
I'll keep that in mind, thanks.
---
&gt; Better nerf SW too
---
This needs to happen but this leads to a bigger issue with metas. They need to have the end bosses drop more loot so its desirable to "finish" the meta and move on. The change to Istan is how I feel the game should be. Have every be worth doing daily but not so good players spend all their time doing the meta/farming mobs 24/7.
---
Oh. Oh, then I got nothing.
---
So I haven't played in a long time and I'm not up to date on in game lingo. Can you briefly explain the "daily stuff" for 35g? Basically all I know how to do is log in, do 3 dailies for 2g, Teq for 2g, craft deldrimor steel and elonian leather (can't be bothered with the others) and that's basically it. After that I usually dick around doing map completion or WvW which isn't super lucrative.
---
I believe that the fountains were one feature that took a while to discover.  From the wiki on Mystic Plaza:  
---
 *The fountains nearby play a slowed down, even tempo version of the Lion's Arch theme*.

I'm still pissed about that event. Being split up into 25 groups that almost all have to succeed just meant that the event is most likely going to fail and waste everyone's time.
---
The Vinewrath is a much better and more forgiving version. It's more fun when you actually have a chance to succeed.
---
I can't, I'm too busy enjoying the game now. 
---
It's been a while since I last played, but I'm getting the itch again and this thread reminds me of my little condi burning tempest build. I actually managed to make it work for lower level PVP lmao. D/F, fire, earth, tempest, WtPA, FtB, Fire signet, and I think rebound. Balthazar rune, Sinister amulet, sigils of doom and I forget the rest. It was really fun! Sometimes I'll role a version of it in PVE for shiggles.
---
&gt;And how many do you think are actually following those rules?
---
Following that logic, Arenanet should remove the chat because some people are abusive within it, the contacts list because others use it to stalk people, pets, turrets, and other automated AI allies that allow one to get loot while afk because some people abuse it and don't follow the rules.
---
&gt;There are very well known ways to exploit ranked PvP and other content using multiboxing
---
And those people can still do that even with this option removed.  ANet didn't fix anything by removing this option other than removing any convenience of autologing in across multiple accounts.
---
&gt;there are far more ways to exploit multiboxing than I can think of reasons to "legitimately" use multiple accounts at once.
---
List them then.  Things such as acquiring, crafting, or otherwise multiple daily gated loot sources or craftables doesn't really count.  It's no different than having friends or guildmates share their loot via guild bank or otherwise.  Saying that the person using multiple accounts to make lots of money isn't really a good argument either as they could have spent the real money they made on gems instead and made the gold that way.  
---
The only thing I can really see this exploiting is mystic coins and lucky envelopes, but hey, I spent $20 on one expansion for another account, the same entry price a lot of other people pay to get into this game, why shouldn't I be able to get the same rewards on that account as anyone else?
---
it's a matter of lack of communication from Anet (on LS not being included in expac) , not their intent to make money out of LS episodes that's in question here, from new player angle. So they should not bring a comparison where a patch in wow is requires more money. That's a brain dead argument for a subscription model game. People will riot if that happens in wow. But no one riots in Gw2 for charging for LS, because logic understands. Having said that, for clarity and honesty, Anet should put a * in each expac saying, LS not included. 
---
Thanks for the response! As far as "questions taboo" goes, I've seen several threads while searching around for info mostly looking something like, "new player, just boosted to 80, what do I do now?" And those people definitely get made fun of.
---
If you don't mind I do have a few more questions:
---
Does what server I selected at the very beginning have an effect on which guilds I can join?
---
Is doing dungeons not really worth it,  or is there another reason why people stay away from them?
---
untill the next person yells at you, and you wet yourself that is
---
"You mislabelled the Alchemy as 'circle of life'."
---
"Are you insulting my religion, Professor?"
---
"No, you're insulting my intelligence and your dissertation score."
---
You have to remember LS1 was every 2 weeks pretty much, where as now its... every what, 3 months? So yeah, of fucking course it feels better for the like 1-5 hours you get to enjoy after every 3 months but there is WAY more waiting with nothing new storywise. Sure, sometimes the 2 week update barely added anything, but it was constant progress, its not always supposed to be something huge. It felt alive because it changed every two weeks. You could miss it, so you had to be there to enjoy it, and after that the story just moved on. I think it was a really cool take. I do agree it needed to change because yeah, you can't keep that up cuz you then waste a fucking shitload of content being made just for 2 weeks-1 month, but it was fucking cool to be a part of.
---
Could it be a new segment of the Fractals? Something like, "Fractal Flashbacks"?
---
God, what a fucking way to come back into the game. I'd taken a break for a little bit, so I missed the end of the molten alliance and the beginning of the aetherblades, I think I caught some of the toxic alliance? But damn, when I did have time to play and I come in to "hey random maps are being fucking invaded with entire armies across the map, go fucking fight in the war" it was fucking beautiful. 
---
Then 2 days in everyone is deliberately failing the event just trying to spawn champions to farm and ruining it. But damn those first 2 days were cool as fucking hell. 
---
The attack on Lion's Arch was also fucking great, and just seeing all of the shit going on and having you see those people suffering from mustard gas and still dying after being "saved", damn. Good times. 
---
It was cool that it constantly changed and you could miss stuff, but at the same time that does suck. It especially sucks that they implemented it live and thus didn't really have a way to instance it well, especially not for small parties. It changed maps and moved on, instead of the instanced chapters we have now which are easily replayable. 
---
Because you keep oversized, child killing rats in cages.
---
I saw people doing that today but the goal just to drag it out until reset so it counts for the next day instead.
---
Have you considered adding it back as an instability?
---
Yeah, but I'll just be pissing a river, not crying it, so I still win. 
---
It was such a good era of the game.
---
Far too much programming.  It'd probably be far worse than actually putting an easy mode into the game with buffs similar to the one's you get at the end of the last living story chapter.  
---
&gt; No, I'm talking about the point that your login data are stored in plain text. And that you - the user - would need to take action to use this function in a save way.
---
&gt; 
---
Ergo, if something happens to my account, it's my fault.
---
Oh please take some personal responsibility and stop bagging for legislation. The last thing we need is more goverment restrictions invading our lives, fuck that noise. 
---
In the US around 2.6% are gambling addicts, that is a vast minority of players and they need to deal with their own issues.
---
All that said if my some chance it ever happens all that income Anet loses will come in cost increases to everything else and not by a little.

I don't get the point? The amount of tweaking you're doing is not only useless for  completely redundant when the focus should be on your CPU. Overclock and tweak that, and you'll be able to run higher player counts and player quality.
---
There were 3 good events:
---
The Tower of Nightmares,
---
The Marionette
---
The end fight on the ship
---
The rest was terribly written guff with the worst ever mary Sue antagonist. But it got us to where we are today.
---
Maxed the height slider
---
Exactly people are responsible for their own actions thats not victim blaming its just the truth of the matter. People seem unable to take personal responsibility for themselves anymore. It's not ANets job thats for sure nor the Govs for that matter. It's sad really that society has slipped into this state imho. 
---
Not Dak, but I'll take a shot. Dungeons are abandoned content; they're not getting updates or bug-fixes of any kind what-so-ever.   
---
They have arbitrary spikes in difficulty, a mix of telegraphed (and untelegraphed) attacks (including crowd-control like knockdowns), the NPC's are prone to bugging out getting stuck on terrain, breaking entirely and having really weird overall behavior.  Dungeons are also vulnerable to all sorts of weird exploits such as merging explorable paths together.  Some of this stuff has been adopted as "features," but only by people that can intentionally reproduce them for benefit.  
---
Without understanding the specific strategies, paths and skills to take to certain dungeons they can be downright frustrating and rage-quit inducing.  They've succumbed to power creep via HoT/PoF elite specializations and everything melts in 15-20 seconds.  If you want to do dungeons you really need to make sure you bring along an experienced mentor that'll either bring massive DPS or the necessary utility.  Furthermore, lots of the common "skips" can be lengthy and someone can easily get left behind. 
---
I'd strongly suggest you avoid doing Caudecus Manor &amp; the Lost City of Arah explorable paths w/o an experienced guide or mentor. 
---
you must be some special brand of idiot if you'll readily admit that you'll piss yourself at someone typing in caps at you and think you come out on top in any capacity
---
These descriptions are like diary entries from the Commander, and they of course assume she is dead. 
---
Woah there, why you gotta kink shame?
---
Yep I got the shoulders on my 5th key, the op balanced the odds out for me. Really I wasnt even going for the shoulders I just like opening some chest every now and then. 
---
I wish death was an illusion
---
1) Chrono is still very useful in fractals. It is used in all runs other than FB/Ren groups. 
---
2) SOI did not affect chronos so badly, as long as players stand in wells and you place Shield 5 well. In fractals, look to reach 100% BD and learn how to pre-stack at the Mistlock Singularity. 
---
On my gear, I run Diviner’s with Scholar runes for more DPS. But anything that gives you 100% BD is fine. Your damage is not your primary concern. 
---
3) I don’t find staff useful. I typically run sword mainland and focus (for pulls) or pistol (for CC). Staff may only be good if you are kiting 99CM or something weird like that. The encounters are so short that the benefits it gives are negligible. 
---
Path of Exile, Singapore server. As long as it’s not having one of its hissy fit days, 17ms ping. I teared up.
---
Meanwhile, everywhere else 230-280ms...
---
...and then there’s GW2 on a bad routing day without a proxy, 800-3000ms, with 120 ping spikes in less than half an hour. Thanks AWS server move.
---
What comes out of the forge when you throw in 4 different colored lucky rabbit's feet. 
---
Heal Scrapper, let's make it mainstream
---
One of the game which I don't really play... Sigh. I would kill for a below 100ms ping in those major games like gw2 and eso haha.
---
Has no one attempted this?
---
Also came here to link to that video. This comment needs to be voted much higher for visibility.
---
That was the only time I saw it happen, delay till reset. All the other ones were just nuking to get it done with.
---
Big twist in episode 6: we never made it out of Mordremoth's brain and we're just having increasingly upsetting dreams. 
---
&gt; Are Boon Chronos even worth taking in Fractals any more?
---
Are you kidding? Chronomancer will never not be overpowered as long as they're the only class that can give both Alacrity and Quickness permanently by themselves. 
---
Definitely fair point, I just saw a lot of people switching over to Power Chrono when the changes came through.
---
The event that happens right at the first Queensdale waypoint in Shaemoor has been bugged forever, and that's the only place you can buy different colors of feet. I had three colors for about a year waiting for a fourth color to drop but it never happened and I finally gave up last week. You can put three in the forge but it will not accept a mystic stone as a fourth... so I am still wondering what it will take as a fourth item. 
---
I'd stop playing if that was true.
---
Yes.
---
But this would also make it easier for groups that just need some extra hand (a tank, a healer, a buff bot) as they can't find more people. 
---
And once they AI is in place it can be reused fairly easy on other encounters with some mechanical variations (tank would probably need positioning, etc)
---
The main idea is to try to create a scaling "easy mode" that can also be used by people training or needing some extra members on the squad.
---
Calm down there satan.
---
This this digital or watercolor?  I love the style.
---
What if we were mordremoth all along.
---
Oh, sorry, one more question - should the non-diviners pieces be still be berserker?
---
Seems like they're holding fast on that one. I don't think they'll revert it anytime soon. 
---
We already have 4 fractals like that, kinda.
---
* Molten Facility
---
* Molten duo
---
* Aetherblade
---
* Mai Trin
---
They could certainly draw inspiration for more fractals, but dunno. I'd rather see them explore something new.
---
Simple, do what I do and just don't have friends!... 
---
;(
---
If the intention was to replace Istan in the next episode, it would have been much healthier to nerf Istan  at the same time they release the new episode... Ah 
---
Yea I just got back in after I quit a week or so after HoT came out. Came back because PoF was on sale for half off. I was surprised people still to world events in HoT. I just put my main character through all of HoT(just killed the dragon today) and now on my way to do PoF. 
---
I also found out the one class that I love and really good with is literally the only one I haven't leveled. Elementalist with a staff is just freaking amazing. 
---
"AB nerfed after berries"
---
If you have Hot and access to AB, then you have access to winterberries.  Unless, of course, you consider logging in once every 3 months a paywall.
---
i played it for straight 4 years i have over 10k hours and i just cant get back into it anymore as much as i have tried i think the lack of dungeons is what completely ruined it for me i was one of those speed runners that loved running them for money i did the first two sets of raids with my small group of 8 friends and we would sell the last few spots. It wasnt just pve i also did wvw hardcore back in blackgate and jq glory  days and  grinded pvp for the legendary and the first seasons when the ranking diamond and what not came out. It really saddens  me how much i love this game but every time i try to come back to it there is like nothing else for me to do :/ Its like vet players dont have  much to do outside of just farm legendaries or ap. :(
---
Oh, I thought the crash was on my end because I got a BSOD soon after.
---
They are running the Fresh Air trait, which refreshes the cooldown on air attunement when you crit. As the SC build has 100% crit chance, they will always crit with Twin Strike and refresh air attunement. Attuning to air will cause a lightning strike, which will crit and refresh air attunement again, allowing you to instantly double-attune.
---
Im 80% certain a dev confirmed, when someone made a post about the weird screaming noises some of the corn makes when running through in the south eastern part of LA, that being the "hidden function"
---
iirc it was something in the corn fields, east of LA, near the windmill. 
---
If you were there some time and move around the corn, you could hear ghostly wispers.
---
There's no reason to change maps without Istan, as no other new PoF maps are particularly engaging or rewarding. They just took our farm away and gave us nothing. I have very little reason to log on, and absolutely no reason to give ANet more of my money.
---
When I get on in a little bit I can try to take you there if you want.
---
It has this autotype feature plus plenty of plugins what can make it easier. Still toying with it.
---
Oh and one more thing. Map completion can be quite lucrative, if you don't wanna build a gen 1 legendary yourself. Just sell your Gift of Exploration over at /r/GW2Exchange for 500-600 each. You can find the requirements in some posts there.
---
We met E

I will no longer be purchasing anything from the cash shop, as a direct result of these changes, since I no longer have a low-key but worthwhile activity to spend the time on between living stories. I'm not a mobile user and I am not really interested in the new time-gated, daily-heavy system they're pushing.
---
Very disappointed as I've been a fan of the franchise since GW1.
---
I have the same settings from that image from wiki, still won't work.
---
I bought my Replica Job-O-Tron backpack from the BL less than 24 h ago.
---
Awesome work! 
---
Those features make me want to try that one over my original autohotkey script! 😁 The novelties menu sounds killer, I'll have to check it out.
---
1. At the moment, if you are not aiming for speed run kills/records, you can play: A: “classic“ Support chrono+druid (both wells); B: fb+chrono (well of recall, mimic); C: ren+chrono (well of action, time warp, mimic). Have done all three in the last week. B and C might not be “meta on paper“, but show perfectly, how versatile chrono now can be for pugs - you can fill every boon gap for quickness, alacrity or both!
---
2. The more BD, the better. Lower bd makes only sense in speed run scenarios, where everyone plays in a way, that the fights just take so much time you can provide boons without many rotation loops. Not the daily business in pugs, so 100% will never be bad. 
---
3. Staff is not neccessary anywhere. Someone mentioned kiting in 99cm. You could as well choose GS. Up to your preference!
---
4. If I understand the recent discussion correctly, as support chrono you aim first for 100bd and then for 100% critchance. Runes can be eagle or scholar or pack (if your party lacks fury and might, more a convenience choice, when you have no druid and the bs qon't compensate that with ps and fgj). A huge chunk of both stats can come from overcapped AR due to pots and the masteries. Anguished teat of alba can help to further enhance your ar for the stat boosts. You can find numbers and the discussion in the DT discord #mesmer
---
lol u mad bro
---
Both are crafting material coffers. The desert one is completely worthless.
---
Thanks so much for the info! Is it even possible to hit 100% CC with 100% BD?
---
I love the Northern Feather Griffon skin!
---
Plot twist: none of this matters since Zhaitan actually won and we are just risen. The story we see is just an illusion to keep the dead under his control.
---
Would you be okay if it was "We are in a dream **now**"
---
Like we're still in the Kralk fight but he used a spell to put us into a nightmare of sorts. When we wake up eventually we will be back in the middle of the real fight with Aurene beside us.
---
All of season 5 takes place in a minute of real-time and it's just mind fuckery the whole time.

---
Or Eye of the North. To witness the "birth" of norns and asuras. Or the death of dwarves.

Welcome back.
---
Also it's just annoying.
---
[Power](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/) [Chrono](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer) is pretty viable.  
---
It's easier than boon chrono, but it's still a chrono and ranger elites will be easier to learn and execute. Mesmer, and chrono specifically(even pchrono), can have a lot of depth and variety.  
---
TBH it's pretty hard to recommend or unreccomnd a mesmer in this case because it's really up to personal preferences. I feel like in your case until you've played a mesmer for a bit you won't know if it suits you or not.  Look at the links to dT and SC above and read up on what they have to say. It might help you get a better feel of the playstyle.
---
Ok here is a quick VOD of my methodology. [GW2 Culling Test Method](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/368894905)
---
There is no real answer to zerk or assassin. It depends on: do you have banner of discipline, perma fury and spotter provided by your party?
---
How much do you have?
---
Example: I run with 215ar, so i am getting much cc and bd just from the infusions. Sometimes in my pugs, i take a few zerk pieces after reaching bd cap, because i have all three mentioned buffs from druid and warrior available and geared my scholar runes to not overcap cc. Sometimes i pick 1-2 assassins trinkets and eagle runes to get to 100%.
---
It is really up to your current gear, ar and party setup, if you need zerk ir assassin.
---
Here is the link to dt's gear optimizer, give it a try: http://old.discretize.eu
---
Which rarity did you use or need to use?  I have 5 white/basic lucky rabbit foots
---
Yep. A goddamn talented 5 year old
---
Do not level boost your character to max level. Play slowly and explore surroundings and your own class before reaching max level. After you have completed base story you will be competent enough to jump into dungeons story/explorable paths. After you have done all dungeons my suggestion is to start doing fractals. Meanwhile try to get mastery in multiple crafting disciplines with the gold you are earning in fractals.
---
After doing a lot of fractals you will have highest grade gear and hence good amount of experience in your class. Then you can jump into raids and pvp/wvw seriously and start looking at tutorials about rotations etc to be more efficient and whatnot.
---
This is the usual advice i give to newbies as a sort of path to follow.
---
It only feels like an empty theme park because the areas of the city that have services that players use are wide-open.  The northwest of the city is housing, the south of the city is housing, but there's generally little reason to go to those places.
---
You don't remember when Scarlet tried to cook Lord Faren?  And kidnapped Hobo-Tron?  And how Hobo-Tron offered to work for Scarlet voluntarily, and that was how he wound up having to do community service afterwards?
---
You probably saw this since there's been a lot of mention of the golden sand, but there's also a Pile of Pink Sand which has no supposed use.

---
Based on what i see with d3d, game uses separate thread for drawing &amp; culling and separate thread for resource loading, and ofc sync on main thread. When game is minimized in true fullscreen it render nothing, that true, but!
---
It basically should use wait-and-check scenario on device state till window is restored, not work-full-force.
---
So to be more correct you should find that threads and jmp-stop them.
---
Also SLI, i have feelings that it uses a lot of extra memory bandwith, which is IMHO the limiting factor for engine.

You're welcome!

&gt; taboo

ridiculous, no this thread is exactly for asking questions
---
&gt; they were getting frustrated 
---
Most of dungeoneers will notice a new player, if they did not vote-kick you this means they are not that toxic and are prepared a) to help you out, b) to carry through the dungeon path; Make sure to watch the party chat for links and short instructions. Alternatively, list your lfg with proper text (i.e.: new/need help) - majority of dungeon community, most of the time will join such group over all 80 blah-blah and with varying amounts of patience and detail explain you the mechanics/tactics of the run.
---
&gt; pvp
---
go unranked, do not wary of anything, practice is important as well as think skin against toxic players skim through www.godsofpvp.net and metabattle details of your build, do some more games before returning to theory again.
---
&gt; wvw
---
it's a large scale pvp with pve gear, be 80, get a gear, follow the mob, there is nothing to worry about in there (your deaths might rally the enemy, but i dont think anyone cares at this point). find the voice comms of your server if you are interested in serious wvw and talk to them about how to progress from there.

see what you like or post your own reqs at r/GuildRecruitment off. forums also have similar thread
---
TACO has a little raid window box that shows what you have killed in the week.
---
Mirage is really strong for soloing and decent in fractals. 
---
Chronomancer is in an odd position at the moment as it used to be ridiculously overpowered and people are still working out how it fits in best. 
---
Power chronomancer is very strong if you keep your illusions up it sort of turns into a tower defence game with your illusions running round protecting you and dealing damage while you back away and time your blocks. There's a chronomancer shortage so you will find it easy to find a place in raids, but be prepared to switch into support builds (either two wells+SoI or mimic+SoI). I find two wells a bit less stressful and seems to get better results, with the additional knowledge that if players aren't standing in the giant noisy neon pink clocks, it's their fault. 
---
If you speak to Ela Makkay again after watching her short S1 cinematic recap in game, she provides rather lengthy voice acted summaries of most of the relevant S1 plot points and the biconics' involvement in them (except for Canach, Ellen Kiel and Evon Gnashblade who also had stuff going for them back then). It's not quite as extensive as the 3-hour S1 movie, bu Ela's voiced explanations provide more context than just watching her short Scarlet's War recap in game.
---
[Ela's dialogue is also recorded in wiki.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Remembering_Scarlet%27s_War#At_White_Crane_Terrace) :)
---
Positive is good :)
---
I'm using gw2launcher instead.  It does work.  Just seems it would have been so much easier for them to fix security on their end by making it not plain text.  
---
Perhaps they didn't realize how much it would affect players and seeing it, maybe they'll make the effort. :)
---
yeah you meet her at hot, but how much time do you acutally spend with her, because the only times you do anything close to bounding is durning this episode and the one in tarir, the rest of the time all she is doing is swooping down to kill something then flys off (and a majority of the time its shit you could have killed on your own) and being in the general area while you talk to npc's isn't bonding. though I can understand them having a hard time making you relate to aurene because she doesn't talk and models in this game have a terrible time acutally showing emotion.
---
gotta ask though, when the hell do you collect presents the second time, because achievements =/= story instances
---
Still no fix for people affected by Asaliea the Channeler bug (deed #3 not checked) :( Can't finish achievement, can't forge new ascended focus :(
---
Intel still King for gw
---
Does he cost cost less than an extra character slot?
---
The tornado lets you fly in it if you jump from a high point :D or utterly destroys you on the ground, whatever makes you happy. 
---
And by the way I got back from a looong break a few months ago and everything is just so much better than it was when I left (some time after HoT was released, never even finished the story there). 
---
Sadness :( I am also waiting on this
---
I am not patient at all thats why I dont even try it haha
---
Welcome to not paying attention.
---
We take her as an egg we're protecting, stolen by Caithe. Retrieve it. Place it under protection of the exalted.
---
Where there for it to hatch in one episode where we defend the new baby against destroyers.
---
We come back in the next episode to train her. We teach her. We share a bound with her. We do a dual attack with her.
---
In PoF, she's a bit older. No longer completely under our control, but always there aiding our cause. She wants to help. She loses not only her mother, but also her brother in POF in the story. The last family she has...besides us.
---
Some people need to be smacked in the head with story because they can't remember from time to time.  So play it on more than one character once when it comes out, and once before the next episode if you can't remember. It's like rewatching a TV series on Netflix before the new season comes out.  It's not rocket science. You can even replay it on the same character if you don't have more than one.
---
But yeah, there's plenty of building if you're paying attention. Anything that would be good for you would be a spoon fed, lead me around by the nose disaster to some of us. 
---
I already think parts of the story are too obvious/spoon fed and you want it to be more like that?
---
I don't know what game you're playing but I'm sure as hell not playing it.

Truly disturbing.

Well, you can never know with these sylvari.

---
Reward tracks are nice that you get some extra gold income but could be implemented much better across the board.  What happens is that the supply for items just goes up and up while the demand mostly stays the same.  This drops the prices for nearly anything added to the reward tracks.  Another example is the skirmish chests with the availability of choosing unidentified dyes.  The prices of them just keep dropping slowly because of supply and demand.
---
Back to reward tracks.  The big problem you can see too is that most of the recent ones are the same.  The only thing that changed in the most recent reward tracks are the final rewards which are usually an item skin and map currency.  I think Anet would have been better off just making a PoF track and adding in selections for final rewards as new map currencies were released.  One great thing Anet did was the ability to choose what you want to buy with excess VM or UM in PvE.  This helps keep prices across the board down but also allow players to keep making money.  Instead you are given more and more of the same loot and the values just keep dropping over time making them all mostly useless.  I’d love a decent reward track with interesting items along the way or that gives badges of honor.  Then let me exchange those at a vendor in spawn for the most valuable items to help both myself and the game’s economy.

&gt; This Saturday January 26th at 8PM GMT (3PM east coast USA), myself, Deroir, Frostball, and WoodenPotatoes will discuss game design topics in Guild Wars 2.
---
Will you and your guests be discussing these topics here on reddit as well or is this just an advertisement for your personal livestream?
---
.
---
If u had to choose between CM only or Dailies only due to time constraints which would provide more loots/rewards/profit?
---
Hm, Had the same problem anderen turning off freesync helped.
---
But i think limitating my FPS to 60 also helped.
---
&gt;!Unlike Aurene!&lt;
---
just daily
---
Thank you for this! It's great to have an explanation as to why choices are made, but also different options and reasons why Snowcrows isn't the best in every scenario. 
---
Really comprehensive. Well presented. Thank you!
---
I would probably do regular T4 because you also get all the "Daily Fractal X" chests for all 4 tiers which brings a lot of gold and some nice chances to get ascended weapons/armor pieces.
---
If people know how to do 99CM you could probably do 99 in CM when it's daily as it's not that hard imo. Since it's not that hard, if you do fractals with mostly friends/guild-mates you could probably do 99CM + Daily T4 for additional profit and not that much more time (if you one shot  99CM bosses regularly).
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
I don't ever do BLC's but I really wanted the shoulders. Like I've literally been waiting for something like this for a long time so I just felt like if I was gonna go and waste my money now would be the time. And what a waste of money it was haha
---
edited, dunno where to put tengu at
---
No chrono ? :o 
---
You think a bot can control a character, farm, use the trading post, spam chat... But can't log into the client without command line arguments?
---
I'm sorry, but you're incorrect.
---
The German word for "referee" is "Schiedsrichter", which is pronounced very similarly to "Cheatsrichter" (if you pronounce the "richter" part as you would in German) . So the name "TheCheatsrichter" could be a pun. Not sure if it was intended or not, but being a German with a passion for puns, I couldn't help but chuckle. 
---
that is just in terms of replayability, I find the maps and story of PoF a lot more enjoyable than HoT
---
To be honest this was always there, you just had to mouse over the price of the item to show the buy offer price.
---
What is your ruling about using Outfits?
---
I haven't done any PvP in a long time so I don't any unique stories past the standard salty whisper after a match, telling me to kill myself.
---
But I remember very early days of raids, doing VG with a random group and this one person losing his absolute mind over how terrible nearly everyone was, and how it was literally impossible for him to carry all of us. Berating us over failed mechanics etc. But whenever someone would even dare call him out on not filling his role, they would not have a bar of it. He was the healer, When I think back then the meta only called for a single Healer.
---
I distinctly remember him yelling back "I shouldn't need to heal your stupid ass if you just avoided the fucking AOE's." (or something to that effect)
---
It's technically true, but it's still the healers job to have the back of the party members who need their health topped up.
---
No one really said anything back, probably because they didn't want to listen to any more of his whiny screeching, or listen to him brag about he was the an amazing healer as he used to heal in elite raids.
---
Anyway, after a while it proves all too much for this "Pro Healer" and former "WoW Elite Raider" and he finally bails, not before reminding us of how much most of us there were trash.
---
So we get in another healer. Everyone welcomes him into the group everyone is still maintaining their positivity and we get set up and go once again.
---
SMOOTHEST FUCKING RUN EVER! (for the time)
---
We clear VG first attempt with this new healer.
---
The new healer was like "How long had you been at it for?" 
---
"2 hours" someone said (I had joined the group midway through this, so I can only imagine what this was like for everyone else involved)
---
Someone else says to the effect of "It's amazing how easy this was once we got rid of that guy and got in an actual decent healer."
---
And to be honest, it really did feel satisfying, to just succeed and prove that the only one keeping the group from success was the very people blaming everyone else but himself. I thanked everyone and took my leave from that group.
---
\---
---
In closing, I have to give kudos to the perseverance of those that group, and the healer who did their job and did it amazingly. I can only hope that the person who im talking about reads this and realizes that despite his ever inflated sense of self worth to the group, it was him that was holding everyone else back from victory, not the other way around.
---
Nope. You are a 100% RNG victim. On the shoulders thread some people bragged how they got them within 5 keys.
---
Tengu are birds, so Avian.
---
Naked charr cub.  I'm not sure how I'm supposed to feel.
---
Oooh! I had just assumed it was people who didn't understand the mechanic (which surprised me, given it was explicitly introduced in the story). Hadn't realised it was farmers.
---
I think we value different things. I love the openness of the PoF maps and the colors used in them. They're far more gorgeous in my opinion. As a GW1 player I also loved to go back to familiar places, and the story about the human gods was far more interesting to me than "dragon #2 awakes from his slumber, go kill it".
---
You're right, the metas are crap and it blows my mind that Arenanet hasn't bothered to fix them. But I generally have a better time roaming around in the desert than I've had trying to find my way through a place like Tangled Depths. Plus I feel like more (all?) HPs in PoF are soloable which makes completion more fun to me.
---
Tarir's still got the best music in the game though. 
---
they just look like birds, never seen them in action
---
Wait was this really you?  O_O
---
This is the worst box in the game! Once you have the recipes you have to open it, scroll to the bottom of the list, select and click - all to get a few flax fibers!
---
At the very least flax fibers should be at the top of the list, as it's the only option anyone would pick after the first few times, but really this box needs to be junked and the rewards made available in other ways.
---
That's very sad as I got the Desert throne and the gecko springer from keys I got from world completion and it took like 3 chest to get both. So I guess I thought uncommon was a little more "common" lmao
---
Yeah, I suppose it's to mitigate the whole 'area appearing overnight just for the sake of the portal' cliche. Probably intended for use with the White Mantle LW3 storyline (possibly the first raid since it's at the edge of the jungle? I can't remember if it's been there since release)
---
Or maybe those bandits are just really, really slow at building that bridge...
---
Like in the list of items before you click into buying it?  Yeah that would be great..
---
please no .. the old Lion's Arch was so unaesthetic.
---
I know you're trollin, but:
---
&gt;log onto my 22 accounts to do the chest farm, crafting and home instance on all the characters?
---
Technically yes, this is a thing. Though it's not necessarily daily, because that's a lot of time spent. xD And you can only multibox for crafting and home instance. Chest runs would all be manual.
---
&gt; I have been making a steady 1k gold a day
---
Not a thing, sorry.
---
&gt;now everything has to be 10 times slower.. 
---
Incorrect
---
&gt;my daily farm already takes up like 5 hours now its going to be 6.
---
5 \* 10 != 6
---
Git Good @ Mathing. (Hint: it's more than 24)
---
&gt; I still need time to do the dailies, pvp, fractals + cm's on at least 4 of the accounts
---
Dont know what this has to do with multiboxing? You'd need to do this manually per account. You might be able to AFK a single account, but why? Unless you're breaking the ToS this isn't really a thing that has to do with multiboxing.
---
&gt;leaves me barely any time to eat and fap. 
---
30 seconds should be long enough, just do them at the same time.
---
Ha I just finished typing out my comment and we're saying exactly the same thing. :) 
---
That damn Coffer is the joke of the year. First of all those recepies you will get in a few days. After that you can choose flax fiber OR food. Well food is great right? Sure except the food is MOUNT food, in which we do not have in WvW at all so the food is utterly useless and used for trolling players to pick up the troll food of the year provided by Arena Net. There are lots of food that came with PoF that could be used in WvW, i mean our comanders pay tons of gold to give us the food that is the better one in WvW, why not do them a favor and give the damn food instead of mount food.
---
And on top of that you have to open each box (and i get about 8-10 every day) scroll down, pick the flax fibre, then open next, scroll down, pick flax fibre and so on. Most people i know simply throw it away.
---
And add to this complaints about this have been done here on reddit numerous of times, been reported to support in game, and i seen post on official forums. AND on to of that even one of Arena Nets partners have explained exactly why this is a bad thing that should not be a reward on both twitch and youtube so it is impossible that this is something that Arena Net could have missed and yet it is still there. 
---
And yes it is harsh explained, but it is nothing what my poor fellow players on my server have to listen to every time i explode in chat or TS about the dumb food and i have happen a lot of time. 
---
At least this one is directed where it should.
---
I work during the week and have little time to play, so 12h on the weekend having fun with other people is actually nice for me, and of course I don't do 12h straight, people need to eat and other stuff
---
Jesus Christ man, too soon.
---
LOL, by shit net, I meant shit "internet".
---
Don't you need a lot of players for raids though?
---
The invisible bug in WvW that been there for years, maybe you could have a new look at it and see if this fractal bug can give any answers to the WvW invisible bug.
---
I usually get everything I want within the first 5 keys.(seems blessed by RNGesus) But I still continue buying my 100-150 monthly keys just to support the game.
---
*Soft...*
---
God I love the patterns and fur on this
---
Since when are magic-warped bundles part of HoT reward tracks? 
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic-Warped\_Bundle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic-Warped_Bundle)
---
This seems easy to answer. Probably a scrapped legendary step. IIRC, one legendary needs you to 'collect' the PoI using a special item (used only for making the legendary in question).
---
Likely the original intention was for each collection piece to start as a regular crafting material but they streamlined it.
---
Yeah it does feel good supporting them honestly. Especially in the last year or so I think they have been doing some great work so I guess there is a silver lining there.
---
because they mostly dumbed down everything in PoF what they introduced with HoT. 
---
in HoT every map had its own reward track (because of different currencies/keys) + we got 8 jungle finisher tracks. 12 in the end.
---
in PoF? 1.
---
I was really looking forward to see the new desert themed finishers but nope, lets just dumb everything down and forget about it...
---
Yeah, I heard if you eat 10,000 of it within 2 minutes, you resurrect the Ancient Karka...
---
(Can't wait for my next Consortium paycheck to come in!)
---
This seems like a weird comment, considering that Ben literally did answer it in the threads he posted? 
---
Do you have a guide for power chrono dps and not support? I'm new to Chrono
---
During yesterday's match, when i mentioned that "no one seems to be here to play to win" (let's count that as toxic remark) after 2 went far, and none to close, 1 died mid right away and 2 of us failed to kite vs 4 of them and we where 200 pts down within 1 min of the match - people seemed to regroup and we won in the end 500 - 490
---
Now if anyone were really toxic, someone would probably tilt and we would loose. Do not be toxic people, and if you meet one, make fun of them, but keep it short. 
---
only reason to do the pof reward track is to unlock armor skins, additionally HOT had 4 reward tracks where as pof has 1, it is very haft arsed
---
But that is not the bug i talk about. There is a bug were you npc goes invisible (every were), then your weapons  and then your self (if you open your hero panel you don't see the weapons and then you are also invisible in the hero panel) then you get the loading bug which takes about 5 min to load in every time you respawn. And if you keep on going you will soon not be able to jump and after that i don't know what happes because at that point people relog. Issue is that it happens more often to the comander because he get moad and this is one of the reasons why this happens. But it can also trigger by using the skill Tornado or Rampage. Some of the tonics makes you instantly invisible when you leaving the transformation. 
---
I realise it is much more complicated then the bug in the fractals, but it been years now so would be great if someone could look in to it. It sucks when the comander have to relog on reset when there is like 40 man queue.
---
&gt; tell your friends
---
Hah!
---
Oh no.. 45 minutes.
---
&gt; You're not listening, the whole point is to break the meta. Keep people in a constant state of discovery - keep the game feeling new.
---
And as I said, only the tiniest fraction will actually discover anything. The other Metas and farming spots aren't unknown to players. There is nothing to discover on that front. The only thing to discover is figuring out which farming spot is now mathematically the best to do. That's it. And only a handful of players will put in that effort.
---
The rest just runs after the them. For them the only change is where they farm. That they farm something new. And for these 99%+ of players, you get the exact same effect with bonus rewards for changing farming spots.
---
And of course it is obvious. So what? Changing drop rates within the Meta is just as obvious. There is no difference whatsoever between the two in that regard. Except maybe your imagination.
---
&gt; Which would require someone to work out what rewards to set, and that loss of resource is exactly what you're saying the main issue is.
---
You don't really belive that setting a bonus reward like this takes the same amount of effort as trying to constantly balance overall drop rates from farms, do you?
---
Yeah, like literally every post asking for most profitable reward track gets answered LS4 map ones 
---
There are some classes which have a decent (or even better) core/base build, like Warrior for example where it's still preferred to run core warrior instead of spellbreaker.
---
Most other elite specs are superior to their core version though.
---
&gt; HoT every map had its own reward track + we got 8 jungle finisher tracks
---
All non-repeatable. Once you finish those tracks, you're left with just one that you can actually repeat.
---
While PoF only had one track, it's one of the best in the game in terms of rewards, especially the armor set selection you get from the end cache.
---
I've opened a bunch of divine lucky envelopes, and the items I've received seem fairly basic and not of much value. However, you can sell the daily 16 envelopes for nearly 10g profit on the TP. What am I missing? Is there a really valuable drop coming from them that I'm not aware of, or is this value just because some of the food is meta?
---
I am uncertain what you want to get out of this. If is about multiboxing then you probably should have added that first. Because i have several accounts but i log in and out manually and never multiboxed ever so if i answer the poll it will be very scew.
---
Fighter games are player versus player oriented so they are competitive by default. I have people on my friendlist and know of people who only play WvW as they enjoy(ed) their competitive aspects. 
---
If you want a better chance to be profitable when opening the enveloppes you need to open them with very high MF (800+% seem to be the threshold).
---
&gt; Dzjinn (how you spell that?)
---
Djinn.
---
good catch, but theres also [Pink Sand](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pile_of_Pink_Sand) that that doesnt seem to do anything
---
Thank you very much!
---
Should rename it to how many friends you have contest, "tell your friends".
---
Yeah, will have to look a bit more on traits, but I believe I've got it mostly correctt.   
---
Understood from guildies as well that the main reason to get Ascended is to put infusions in them. We do these on an almost weekly basis, so I expect I'll need it sometime sooner than later. Only playing since maybe 3-4 weeks, been doing T1 fracts and had one with infusions yesterday but had a druid along to keep me somewhat in life.   
---
Figured there's a plethora on sigils and runes. It's difficult choosing :P  
---
Oddly enough, I didn't spend much time checking out all different pet abilities. Half the time I even forget I have one :x   
---
There need to be some extra checks - like triggering only on manual party leaving by particular player
---
yea, i get.
---
lets start with #4, one who wants to leave will ask commander to kick them. so there be no waiting. #1 who keeps their bags full?
---
Been doing some PvP recently, although I have 0 idea what I'm doing.  
---
LB works since it doesn't require too much instant adaptability and I can just "snipe" from a distance.   
---
Tried A/A  and Sw/A the other day... was an epic fail. Sometimes it feels like I get one shot. 
---
Can by bypassed by disconnecting the computer manually from the internet to make the game think it's a disconenct. Or even easier. Alt+F4. 
---
You see, this doesn't work.
---
*Running around with both of the SAB infusions*
---
Is there a story line to that madness?
---
I am a lettuce, are we more pure mordremoth ?
---
**— GET TO THE PACT CHOPPER!**
---
Ah thanks! So I guess they changed signet of inspiration, right? but isnt chrono still one of the few specs that can maintain alacrity and quickness?
---
Allow you to get 8g88s88c, it's just raw gold.
---
You kind of cant because for living world season 1 they used to change the entire map for it. E.g.
---
*Nightmare tower in kessex hills, loading screen for kessex hills also changed, now you see the debris from the tower explosion
---
*Lions arch was not a town map, scarlet attacked and you could find mobs in the map like in any other map, the buildings and monuments we were so used to seeing were destroyed (like the lion fountain)
---
So now they do things differently, by adding a whole new map, like bloodstone fen, bitterfrost frontier for each episode instead of altering an already existing one, since for season 1 when the episode ended they used to revert the map back to how it used to be. 
---
While that was really fun because the world was as if it was changing and "living" as time goes, it also stopped the newer players from being able to replay it.
---
well the pack thing was wierd. You want pack for anti-snowcrows comps with healing necro/rev/ele. Pack really should be default imo.
---
Well ascendant gear is account bound , so you can switch them around on different characters as you wish.
---
The crafted ascendant gear can be stat swapped via mystic forge for a small price, so some people craft the cheapest set and then switch the stats around.
---
Ascendant trinkets cant do that, unless they come from a special set. The pvp mist trinkets can do that, and the LWS3 bloodstone set can do that as well.
---
Pets dont just have different abilties that you can activate every 20 seconds or so, but also different auto attacks as well as stats.
---
Some can become pretty good tanks for you, some can do good cc, others can provide additional condition dmg, and switching between 2 tanky pets can allow you to solo some champions even.
---
[this](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/) can help you try out different runes and sigils, and you can even try them out in game inside the pvp lobby
---
Thats some new cammo there
---
I actually made mine recently too (also Bifrost).   
---
Took me 2 days then it started feeling the same as an ascended but with pretty effects! (xcept from that eye-cancer rainbow trail that stretches when you move. It's 2001 tier graphics).   
---
 PLS UPDATE GRAPHICS ANET
---
The thing is, pressing your mount 1 button (the dive button) without moving forward GAVE you that endurance regen infinitely without needing to use something like bond of vigor, allowing you to get more flaps for more height as long as you didn't move forward.
---
It was a very long existing bug not many knew about.
---
ty so much. this is really helpful
---
Any item that drops that has that gray text is technically "Junk" -- items that exist only to be sold to a vendor for money. When you hit the "Sell Junk" button when interacting with a vendor, those gray items are what get sold.
---
The Ornamental Golden Trophy specifically happens to be very expensive junk, selling to a vendor for 8g88s88c.
---
She's just trying to go off the grid.
---
I rarely use the few outfits i have (most of them are free, but i use the haloween one during the event just for fun sometimes).
---
Normally whenever i decide i want to invest more time on a character , after i get the armor/weapon set with the stats for a specific build i usually stand naked in front of the bank wardrobe and try out every single piece of armor in the game. I hunt the skins down, and then i have the perfect armor set i like for that character.
---
There are also only a few of my characters that use multiple builds, having 2 armor sets in total, in which case i make 2 different armor "outfits" for them as well and im perfectly happy i can switch my appearance based on the role/build im playing.
---
This also means i payed the 9-10 trans charges per set and i dont have to anymore
---
Thats how i deal with my fashion wardrobe :)
---
You can easily give groups that same easy ness and teach them with mechanics using the system they used at the end of the last LW episode. Personally, I don’t want so much dev time wasted on developing NPCs when it could be just easily be done with boons, buffs and scaling the bosses down.
---
Just like that one time in archer:
---
	Lana: What the hell are you doing?
---
	Archer: I’m Archerizing this plan!
---
	Lana: What? No, no, uh-uh, you cannot make yourself a verb. I will not allow it.
---
	Archer: I’m a verb now, Lana, deal with it. And then also cover me, please.
---
I haven't seen any guide that propely emphasises Focus offhand. Focus is your main (after shield) NOT Sword especially for first 3 wings. Understanding importance of pulling and how to execute them is far more important for a chrono than benchmarking with Sword. Focus needs training, sword does not.
---
But I am a sylvari.
---
"let's start with #4 and downwote based only on that single thing" - I guess this is what happened here .\_. disappointed
---
No, it wouldn't.
---
I don't believe in death. I've lived for about 10.000 days now and I never died. Statistically speaking, the chance of dying is 0% for all of us here.
---
That doesn't matter. It's a joke (that makes me unhappy).
---
Exactly. When I see 5 players go down 5 seconds into sloth I'm out. 
---
And even if they would implement it, it would just be used as a tool for grieving because you can just gg at the start of the fight to make a wipe
---
👉😎👉
---
Im not massively experienced in pvp. But my guess is that on average its faster to respawn than to risk bandage being interrupted. Theroetically someone could keep you downed for the whole game.
---
The person who downs you often keeps an eye on you in case you start to res and will throw one attack on you to cancel the revive. If that happens, you are extending the amount of time you are out of the action, which is a huge bonus for the other team. 
---
Yup.  
---
But ren+fb is being run successfully as an alternative to chrono+druid.
---
According to lore, minis can be categorized in various ways: we have dolls (e.g. the humanoid ones) powered by micro golems (made by asura) or djinn essences (made by humans), or they are simply small or shrunken creatures (when it comes to the actual pet-like creatures) as seen with Zommoros's trade. :)
---
Here's some of the stuff we know about minis in lore from GW1 and GW2 (I'm sure there are other sources as well):
---
* [The Gwen doll](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gwen_Doll) is powered from the inside by one of Zinn's magical micro golems. Toymaker Tixx's minis from the Infinirarium and Toypocalypse are likewise golems which are sabotaged by Toxx for her own nefarious purposes.
---
* [The Toy's Story](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Toy%27s_Story) quest's toymaker Mahk suggests that some minis are toys made by humans and activated with a specific method: "That broken toy you have there would be perfect. I could never get it to work, though. It needs to be imbued with essence from a whimsical djinn to activate its magic. Perhaps a hero such as you could acquire the essence for me."
---
* [Mythwright Gambit raid](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mythwright_Gambit) has an event (one out of two variants) dealing with mini and megapets going on a rampage and describes the process of how the mini tigers etc. are created by Zommoros in the Mystic Forge.
---
I still love it when I see ipos floating in front of me, I think I crafted it about a year ago. 
---
Beautiful... I am in love with the quality of season 4. It’s amazing seeing how they get better with every season and expansion. Anet knows how to make a great MMO. 
---
Chess Dragon corrupting all the npcs
---
Considering they never did it for episodes after Bloodstone fen, they probably thought it was a huge mistake since people would only ever farm one set. Hence why the rest of LS3 doesn't gave it
---
Also I've only seen a single [NPC](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gr%C3%ADmur_Oddursson) with a mini, but he doesn't talk about the technological background.
---
Would be super disappointing if it was a raid tbh, especially after all the hype surrounding the Wizard's Tower. If anything it should be a dungeon (wishful thinking) or LS content. They shouldn't block off something like the Wizard's Tower, which everyone is curious about, behind a super difficult type of content that only certain players do.
---
Black Lion Claim Tickets are made up of Black Lion Claim Ticket Scraps, which drop randomly from BL chests. If you don't want to rely on RNG, you can buy the skin from other players through the Trading Post. The Wiki shows the lowest sell offer and the highest sell offer. Sell offers are the price players set their price at and buy offers what buyers set their offer at. In this case, as a buyer, you can either spend a bit more gold but guaranteeing you get the item immediately by buying from one of the sell offers (the lowest one to save some gold) or if you're more patient you can set your buy offer for a bit less and wait for somebody to instantly sell it to you. Keep in mind that anyone could post a higher offer, making the wait longer. You can cancel your listing and post another one if this happens.
---
So in the case of the Abaddon Greatsword Skin, you can either instantly buy it for 110g or list it for ~71g and wait until somebody sells it to you.
---
When you get the skin, you can consume it to unlock it on your wardrobe, or use it on a weapon AND unlock it on your wardrobe. Once unlocked, you can use a transmutation charge to change any other greatsword to have this skin.
---
A raise? For what? This bug had been present for too long. Its embarassing they fixed it that late.
---
Don't listen that guy
---
That, even if true, will never make me leave.
---
Obsidian armour skins leaked
---
Expressing any opinion about raids on this subreddit, unless it's a 100% regurgitation of the collective herd mentality re: raids, is guaranteed to generate tons of shitdownvotes.  Expressing any opinion about WvW is almost as bad.
---
On the good side, you now have a lot of [Black Lion Statuettes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Statuette), and can spend them on stuff that only appeared in the BL Chests at some point (with a rotation). Like right now, you can buy the BL Chests exclusive [Exalted Gloves](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exalted_Gloves_(consumable)) for 60 statuettes, which were in the chest a few months ago. So cheer up, the Exalted shoulders will be available at some point!
---
&gt; AEDT
---
Ouch, that's a 10 hours difference with me (CET) so it rules pretty much europe out.
---
As for guilds, there are a lot of guilds that shout in Lion's Arch, maybe you can try that, that's how I recruit sometimes.

I'm a GW1 vet as well and loved checking out the familiar spots but that wore off after the first time. I also didn't pay for PoF to just roam around. Dropping the ball on repeatable content for an MMO is pretty asinine. Also I think Anet did Mordremoth the most justice out of any of the dragons we've seen so far. People seem to reduce him to Zhaitan 2.0 but Zhaitan didn't have fucking Dragons Stand like meta and the build up that went along with it. TBH I'm disappointed every time we see Kralkatorrik and he's just flying around screeching. I think they could've given him a voice and personality to contrast with Mordremoth. 
---
Where did the wvw devs go
---
If you had been working in Software Development for any length of time you'd know how hard it can be to pin down the source of bugs that are this complicated. Sometimes you are literally fishing in the dark, staring at code that looks perfectly fine.
---
I find it admirable to stay on the case for this long when you could easliy postpone it even more as "Can't fix"
---
Thats the reason, why Canach is one of my favourites, because I saw him joining the group. Of course we had a history before that (Southsun), but there he was our enemy. 
---
The others are just like "Hey, you don't know us, but we are really really good friends!" As if you woke up from a coma.
---
Its just bad rng, 5keys for a very rare item is nothing.   
---
Think about what other very rare items do you usually get from keys in general?
---
Its like saying throwing rares into MF for a precursor is rigged.
---
Upgrading mats via MF is also total rng and if everyone had overall profit 100% of the time then i would assume everyone would already buy up all the mats and sell the high end tier back for instant profit by now.
---
As for rng loot drop, it depends on what and where you were doing lately. If youre farming various events and large metas then it might seem very different than from just exploration and doing story during the same time frame.
---
Lol too late I spent like £40 on keys. At least I manged to get them so there's that. 
---
Because asuras belong in cages.
---
Trust no one, not even yourself
---
BIGGEST MYSTERY IN THIS GAME IS DATE OF BALANCE PATCH,HALF YEAR AFTER ANNOUNCING NEW BALLANCE TEAM.
---
Now, THAT is quality armor!
---
We were losing 100 to 200 in Arena i think. A player just stays afk (no disconect, just afk) on the 400of the enemy i ask to please report the idle player and then he just start talking in global about how imposible was to win (100 200 is an really easy comeback...). After game endend that player just keep whispering me about how shitty player i was and how i should quit pvp.
---
Classic ranked MM
---
This is exactly what I wanted to know. Thank you for the great answer :)
---
as some1 whos doing daily cms+t4,find yourself and quickbrand friend and you are back into perma 11 boons spam,solo chrono is still good,but lacking fast cc obviously and its possible to hold perma quickness and ala without any issue,belive me ppl already learned how to stand in wells. you shoud go for 80% boon duration and if you feel like you doing good in rotation,you can tone it down to 60%. chrono shoud never use staff in cms,in t4 it doesnt rly matter i guess. focus on boons and allways blame dps :D you will not save pt with +3k dps,but you can save them with perma boons.
---
Every time my charr ele does that idle animation where she tosses her scepter in the air, I'm like "aaaah don't DO that?? don't you know how long it took to make Meteorlogicus for you?? Don't drop it!!" :D I finished it back when HoT was new (though I had the pre before precursor crafting came out. A guildmate got TWO Storms in a week, it was ridiculous). It's still special!
---
I have a Bolt. Love it! the only irritating thing is its sound every time u popped it, and I had to disable the sound. But I hardly play sword in any class nowadays. May be time to go dust it up from some toon somewhere.
---
I was one before i mained one
---
Chicken or egg?
---
Quaggan will make you FOOBAR.
---
Does buying the Replica Job-o-Tron backpack skin from BL statuette have the same features as any other Replica Job-o-Tron backpack? Mine seems to not proc. I also checked the sound settings, I did not disable it. 
---
Speaking of that, to this day, I still carry a lucky rabbit's foot in my inventory... for... reasons.
---
You can play quickbrand, a guardian build with the PoF elite spec firebrand. It is an offensive support that provides quickness while still doing good dps.
---
If you want to go full support you can pick up a healer (druid will be the most wanted one), heal and alacrity renegade, or support chrono that gives quickness and alacrity and can extemnd other peoples boons. 
---
You can find builds and guides for any of those choices on snowcrows.com
---
It has nothing to do with the amount of people playing WvW itself. It has to do with the attitude of the players playing WvW. 
---
The vast majority of players are "fairweather". They will happily follow and join whenever you win and it's pleasant for them. They are NOT interested in sticking with the team the moment things get difficult. That's why you can get 50+ players and karmatrain / dominate the maps when you win hard, but go down to almost no players the moment you face stronger groups. Numbers aren't inconsistent because there aren't enough players, but because most players aren't interested unless you feed them bags. 
---
This makes it impossible for both commanders and many pug groups to learn. You don't learn much from running around the map dominating it and karmatraining everything. And as soon as you find stronger enemies, most of your group will leave you so quickly there's not much left for you to do. It's hard to learn if you're either winning by default because your enemies give up, or losing by default because your allies give up. 
---
You can only break this by having a dedicated following. A community, a guild, people that stick with you if you win and if you lose. You can then discuss what you did well in fights you win. What you did wrong in fights you lose. How you should move as a commander. How you want your players to move and use their skills around you. You can improve as a group, community, both in individual skill and in teamplay. 
---
The vast majority of players (left) in GW2 have absolutely no interest in this. You're a free service that provides them with bags. You're a means to an end; they don't care about your interests or the interests of the group / community.   They don't care about improving. If you're not providing them with bags you're a bad comm and they'll simply go do something else. 
---
The difference between "stacked servers" and all the other servers isn't population numbers; but that stacked servers have a **minority** of community players. People that play together for the sake for playing together and improving. And plenty of players that enjoy the benefits they provide. These include "tryhards", when they lose they start trying harder to win. Instead of suddenly having no players, you have players discussing what went wrong. Sometimes things get heated, but they won't just silently log off because "oh losing isn't fun for me". 
---
You can swap to servers with higher coverage than stacked servers, but the inconsistency won't change. The inconsistency isn't the result of a lack of players, but of almost all players having no interest in the server they play on, the groups they play with, the commanders they follow, ... They only care about their bags and feeding the delusion of being good players while pressing random buttons without strategy, tactics or teamwork. 
---
You can try to form a community. Convince people to stick around. Improve and play together. You'll need lots of energy and time, and most players that follow you will not respect this effort. Keep in mind that, unless you have a reasonable idea of what you're doing, these community servers won't suddenly follow you either. Therefor most tend to favor closed "guilds" nowadays, as pugs have become incredibly entitled without offering much return. 
---
GW2's WvW will continue to struggle with "inbalance" as most players aren't interested in "even" fights. And while many players on non-stacked servers accuse the stacked servers of only wanting to faceroll; that's not true. Facerolling non-stacked servers is simply a consequence of not playing as badly as possible. It's so "easy" to make most servers crack and stop playing entirely that any server with a small core can do it.
---
Honestly.. I only ever do reward tracks for the end chest... only time I carried about middle cheats were the dungeon tracks.
---
Only underwater.
---
You just need to install CS:Source 
---
Firebrand is now a great support option, especially in fractals if you can find a renegade to complete the duo build. [Here's an up to date guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ahcoqh/updated_builds_and_benchmarks_for_diviner/). While it's focused on raids, the build is also good on fractals, just make sure you use the power build, not a condi one.
---
You might need more diviner than their build if you want to be safe on the boon duration and the runes and weapons are different. If you're committed to playing it changing this shouldn't be too expensive.
---
&gt;This theory assumes that Aurene obtained Joko's power to revive from the dead. I hardly keep up with theories and speculations, so apologies if this idea has already been put on the table.
---
discussed to death my dude.
---
&gt;Fighting Kralkatorrik over and over, slowly wearing him down until he is defeated.
---
that's kinda fucked up my dude
---
Idk but I remember when someone finally got Final Rest and I think it turns out Anet just forgot to activate it in game or something. 
---
Generally it takes longer to get back into the fight by rezzing yourself than just dying. There are some exceptions like Ranger who can have their pet rez them, but otherwise just take the death I guess.
---
While I agree with you, it would be nice to list at least some issues so that you don't get downvoted just for being negative.
---
Especially the LS rewards. Im still running back to all LS3 maps for the ascended stuff while LS4... only the Ep2 and the latest map. even that only last until i got all the ascended weapons and maybe a handful Serpent Jewels for stat swaps.
---
Im grateful for the new skins, i do but i kind miss the previous map metas since its almost always dead empty. kinda feel bad for new/returning players since it would be hard for them to finish some achievements.
---
Still, preventing further adds from spawning would actually allow you to place three people each where the menders spawn, making the event much more reliable. Can we try this some time? I really want to know if it works.
---
What's going on in the Dominion of Winds? It's a central area in Tyria and is a giant hole in the map.

I know some of those words.

when i ask a legitimate question and someone responded with something stupid and unrelated with"well my feeling are hurt because people type angrily" yeah it makes me think that he/she is actually an idiot, i wouldnt mind playing with you but im mostly a pve guy.

then you  should be upvoting me, im hoping this is the fattest nut you'll have all year

there, I've updated it.

    Wasn't it speculated that E was just how &gt;!Lord Faren signed his name? Laying the L over the F. E.!&lt;
---
Ahh I wasn't aware, thanks. 
---
They weren’t considered the default until snowcrows put it on their site. There are *many* situations where you run a standard comp with 2 Druids, making the bonus from running pack runes unnecessary if your Druids are good/somewhat competent.
---
Additionally, it hinders new chronos trying to cap on BD through the 10% less that it provides as opposed to water or leadership.
---
That said, they absolutely do have their strengths in certain situations :)
---
Rule of focus n°1 : Use the pull of Focus4 just when your friend ate the shroom during slothazor.
---
I recall hearing (could have been speculation) that there would be an orb-like item for each dragon.   
---
For me it was somewhat bolstered by the Gilded Forrest orb in Orr and seeing the Golden Cave and finally the Exalted...  Turned out to have been nothing or maybe just dropped.  
---
On the subject of items that fight/remove dragon corruption:  The Altar of Glaust in Arah where Glint was first cleansed by the Forgotten.  It's still there, why hasn't anybody even thought about it?
---
But isn't Pof a "god #2 escape from his jail, go kill it"? 
---
And on a meta level, a god and a dragon in gw lore is juste more or less a "box of flesh" with a lot of energy in it. And when you destroy that box the energy is released and could be channeled into an another box. I never considered Balthazar really that different from a dragon. He had an army he created so as each dragon, he had local ennemies so as each dragon.
---
I never felt Mordremoth or Balthazar being that different. And wouldn't be surprised if someday we learned that human gods are dragons and humans are their creation/minions.
---
Don't be so sure. My guild have 2 members dead in real life. 2 tombstones in the guild hall to remember that death is real
---
There were a few mistakes/misconceptions -
---
1. You can run pack runes when your second healer is not a Druid *as well* (I completely forgot to mention this)
---
2. Focus should absolutely be emphasized on fights where you need pulls (I may not have emphasized it enough)
---
3. Druids absolutely do provide might to ten players, it’s the fury and swiftness and 5 stacks of might from WH 5 that would be made up by pack runes that I was talking about
---
and there might be another point or two- but overall I believe the large majority of the info (esp for a 45 minute video) is correct :) I will update this post if more comes up 
---
Farming is part of mmos. Its part of the economy. Whats ruining the game is handing players something and anet taking 1 yr to remove it and then claim its "buffed". People would complain, but it wouldnt be as much of an issue if anet were just truthful upfront.
---
Also material prices are unlikely to change much. Its like ectos, too little too late.
---
Scrapper in WvW isn't used at all for damage. Just pure healing, you're expected to stay in Med Kit pretty much all the time unless you drop it for the utilities of hammer. For instance Skill 2 for a Combo Whirl Finisher, Skill 4 for Block, and Skill 5 for dropping a Lightning Field. You'll also generally take Elixir Gun for the utility and heal, also for the toolbelt heal. So basically your entire job in WvW (Zerg) is putting out heals this way, while also using your Gryos (Bulwark and Stealth) for Stability, Damage Reduction and obviously Stealth. The Utility Gyro (Can't remember the actual name) is also extremely helpful allowing you to both rez allies and finish foes from afar. When I tend to run Scrapper (Which isn't often) I always take Tool Kit as well, just so I can pull people down from walls.
---
You certainly have a lot of insight on the matter, and I agree with what you said. Also thank you for putting in the time to write all this. The only thing I can really do at this moment is I will continue to play WvW and do my best to encourage teamplay and community. If these efforts fail then I will consider transferring to a more populated server and try again with a "larger" playerbase. Whether I must lead or follow I don't plan on leaving WvW any time soon. Hopefully in time myself and others can strengthen the GW2 WvW community and perhaps bring it back into the light. Again, thanks for your input.
---
Alternate futures/timelines can be seen as other dimensions. I agree it's not the best terminology, but that's string theory in a nutshell.
---
There is a Quaggan in rage form hiding behind the nearby bridge also. Though not explicitly said, I believe they're connected.  
---
There is a similar murder mystery in the large mausolieum under the Grenth waypoint in Divinity's Reach.  They make it sound like they found the lair of a serial killer.
---
It's funny that I never even thought about the rune breaking part...
---
...hopefully the underwater fractal is the easiest and fastest one, but that's something to keep in mind if they put some underwater content.
---
There really shouldn't a reason to not remove the luck cap completely, cause with how the requirements scale it's not like people's luck is going to go up by much.
---
Fucked up?
---
https://pics.me.me/lets-try-this-again-starter-pack-eckdeeporn-10387169.png
---
Its pretty common. Not only anime but games like ghost trick, 999 and stuff.
---
Honestly both expansions are a must if you want to have the full experience, but if I have to chose one my favorite is POF (unlike most of this sub), I like the mounts, the story, the map, the raid's wings and the new elites. 
---
Yknow that Support Necro as a 2. Support, especially in Training Groups is way better than a 2. Druid r? The carry Potential w/ strong Barriers and it being a rez God makes it waaaay better than running a 2. Druid. 
---
I've literally kept a reaper in downstate for over 3 minutes of a match, which made those 3 minutes a juicy 5v4 in favor of our team. Trying to bandage can cost you the game. 
---
Yeah, and tbh I messed up because I *forgot* to say that you can use them if your second healer is not a Druid.
---
Also, I think classifying then as BiS for DPS is a bit of stretch- two competent Druids will get you all the boons that you need in most situations.
---
Agreed. I generally just would like to have some clarification on Anet's part. Weather there are plans, or this is the final solution (and if we get an Option to turn stacks in). I currently have 800 Slots full with stacks of luck, so I just like to know:)
---
Look into another Comment of mine. Druid is most definitely not the best Choice as 2. Support, especially in Training Groups. 
---
There are actually alternate dimensions. WvW's lore is literally three Tyrias fighting each other, and since Prophecies it's been stated that the Mists is a multiverse.
---
Multiple possible futures has also been a thing since A Light in the Darkness in the PS, where we see a possible future that doesn't (fully) come to pass.
---
I do most of my achievements between Power Soulbeast and Chrono with shield. Chrono is great because shield gives you extra blocks, and the evasions/distortions allow you to avoid getting hit.
---
Well we’ve died before so we know what death is like. This doesn’t seem like death.
---
The first part has been discussed a lot. But fighting Kralk over and over hasn't.
---
Is there any way to fix the mount not loading after i use a waypoint bug? I have this bug for month now, i try to mount up and i stuck in the ground but on the map i keep moving.
---
That’s fair - I’ve never really thought the overall proportion of fights that use it in regards to the # of encounters. But in any case, if they take my advice at face value then they’ll use focus in the cases that require pulls.
---
That is something I’ll try and emphasize more though :)
---
It is not, but Anet can't do anything about a key logger.
---
IIRC, some visions show members of Dragon's Watch dead, then later show them alive. So if they're meant to be of the same timeline, rather than multiple possible futures, they're out of order.
---
But this theory has been brought up. The "Joko's magic will revive Aurene making her immortal" is literally bandwagon theory #1, while the "visions were not of multiple possible futures but one" is climbing its way up to join the most commons.
---
Thanks for the explanation, suppose the crafted ascendant gear is the "legendary" gear people talk about?   
---
There's a whole lot to do to get to that though, but it's something to work on.   
---
Will have to look more into pets, currently using mainly Hyena in pvE. 
---
&gt;Pink sand seems to be too expensive to just be an useless item so what could it be for?
---
If WP doesn't know, its unlikely somebody else does, otherwise he would have mentioned it.. but hey he is human, I'm also supperr curious about it too!
---
*Disclaimer: After typing out this comment I realize how mean it sounds, but I just feel like you're very wrong and I'd like to explain why. I hope there's no hard feelings.*
---
Gods have personalities, a dragon is just a dragon. There's no negotiation with dragons. They're just large primal forces. Balthazar is a god with a *lot* of established backstory, so it was very interesting for me to have him as our adversary. There's also plenty of people in Tyria who have spent their life devoted to the worship of Balthazar, I liked seeing the ramifications of his treason.
---
&gt; And on a meta level, a god and a dragon in gw lore is juste more or less a "box of flesh" with a lot of energy in it.
---
That's like saying "on a meta level, we're all just a collection of atoms". Like, yes, that's true. Doesn't mean that on a non-meta level we're something else, too. The gods are not at all like dragons. They are curious, vain, treacherous, loving. They make mistakes and they do inexplicable things. They're very much like humans. Some even were human (Kormir) or half-human (Grenth). 
---
Dragons just want to consume magic. They're predictable, boring villains. There's no reasoning with them, there's no intrige. If you feel like Mordremoth and Balthazar are similar villains I can't help but think that a lot of the plot is lost on you.
---
I also liked how Vabbi was portrayed. The propaganda, the centuries of brainwashing. It was a kind of nuance you don't see often in MMO's. As a player you feel like these people are being lied to and that you should help them, but you soon find out that many of these people's family members are Awakened. That to Awaken is an honor to these people. Is it right to intervene? I liked how that part of the story was morally ambiguous. There isn't anything on that level of storytelling in HoT. The dragon just corrupts, and that's it.
---
Yeah it sucks that it is most likely because other people are not as secure with their systems that this was taken away. However remember that if this results in a chargeback, and it most likely will, then that cost Anet money. Money that can be used elsewhere to help improve the game. But again this is just a possibility of a reason that this was taken away. I don't know the specifics I'm just speculating on one of the most reasonable scenarios I can think of that got them to do this.
---
Lmao open community voting on a fashion wars contest. Came here to say don't bother concerning yourself with winning
---
&gt;Fighting Kralkatorrik over and over, slowly wearing him down until he is defeated.  
---
Sounds like my first experience fighting Caudicus at the end of Head of the Snake.  Or a number of early on GW1 experiences when I simply wanted to explore the zones but was too hard headed to quit when my all hench team and Arenanet-endorsed ham storm build couldn't take on the enemy groups.  
---
Doing it sucks but it does make for some fond memories...years later.
---
Why so you need to farm m8
---
Don't doubt yourself! That's exactly what it was. If memory serves, it included the D'Alessio Arena, Claw Island, the Wizard's Tower, and the gap between Lion's Arch and Kessex Hills (D'Alessio Seaboard).
---
However, I don't think it looked like a particularly fleshed-out map, given that most of the area was water and the D'Alessio Arena looked pretty featureless. I see why they cut it.
---
I hope this gets Upvoted so the community will know, what it's ont he mind of the devs. If this is the permanent Luck sink they talked about years ago, or there is somthing else comming. As well that they might consider the option of turning in stacks of luck. 
---
I think the mods shouldn't remove anything, the upvote/downvote system is there for the actual community to decide.
---
But his name is Bob, not Lord. 
---
Just finished gearing my Chrono. Perfect timing!
---
Likewise, I've recently gone through all LS1 achievements with my condi guardian who I gradually switched to a power dragonhunter in the process. 1 legendary weapon, 1 ascended weapon, a few ascended add-ons and exotic armour.
---
A couple of those toward the end required a few tries (No Refuge, the final Point Of No Return boss) but practice and gradually increasing damage output got me through.
---
As we've pointed out, there are plenty of people willing to teach players or even finish the raid and keep it open for others to explore. I guarantee if you are proactive about it, you'll be able to see it for yourself.
---
And if it's any further comfort, keep in mind the "mini-raid" design they used for The Secret Lair of Snowmen. It's possible they were using that to test the waters for less-intense raid-like experiences.
---
Frankly as someone who get lost in games/real life, the HOT maps were too confusing to navigate through. 
---
&gt; Mini Djinns
---
Yes! That's an excellent point! I'm sure plenty of people would be willing to help figure that out.
---
isnt that perfect to get lost? ;)
---
Very well drawn! 
---
Really brings out the grotesque in necromancy! 
---
This is one of my pet peeves about PoF, I get that it's part of the story and all and it's kind of obligatory, but man.. I wish we could experience all of Elona without the ugly Palawa Joko tar stuff and purple brand everywhere. I had been hoping to seeing the beauty of Elona in GW2 ever since I got it a month or so after launch, it had always been my favourite continent/expansion from GW1 :(
---
still plenty of sales for both expansions running:
---
https://gg.deals/games/?title=guild+wars
---
they are ALL legit sites. no BS.
---
I think you can just buy the ls3 stories, first one and third one have backpacks available. (Blood ruby backpack (stats can be changed) and petrified wood backpack)
---
especially since stuff is now more worked around quickness. Backstab -&gt; AA --&gt; backstab feels so weird now without quickness QQ
---
The only one I found are those for the mystforged/glorouse armour and that pvp one for that (mini?) the rest should be the same 
---
May be wrong or have overseen something but I don't think so.
---
Destroy. 
---
top of my head it's the glorious track, the stronghold tracks and the rank and then jungle rank tracks that are pvp-only, apologies if I'm wrong on that score, at work
---
This sounds as crazy as the Harry Potter theory that says he was in coma
---
Power reaper.  Has solid AoE damage output and enough CC. Can just facetank minor attacks and adds while saving dodges for the "achievement attack" that you need to avoid.  Or use endurance regen food.  You can add minions as a distraction if you need to babysit an NPC or, alternatively, add blood magic line and well of blood for healing ability.  
---
"Not spoiler" *gets marked as spoiler*
---
&gt;You are an elitist asshole for expecting everyone to play GW2 with the aim to become a hardcore player.
---
You are defining anyone with a competent build as a "hardcore" player?
---
What stat changer from bloodstone fen? Did I miss something big here?
---
  
---
Also I fully agree with the reward track argument, it blows...
---
I just feel the lore isn't solid enough on the matter to allow ourselves not distinguishing timelines and "dimensions".
---
And WvW is obviously not something to take seriously from a lore point of view.
---
Can I get some sip!
---
How would that method use 4 subgroups? the method i explained would still use two, the main zerg which cycles the main level for pods/preservers then drops down a level and circles there, then the boss group which catches the last preservers on the main level before going against the boss. i dont understand where two more groups came from.
---
You can get the basic "feel" of a class by the time you hit 30 IMO. When I say that many disagree with me but by leveling nearly every class up to 30ish before committing to a "main" helped me decide. 
---
But the 80s boost in case you didn't know doesn't have to be "activated". You can mess around in SW and then make the decision if you want to use it or not.  
---
I had some comments when brlinking on higher field -most maps have  thes places where blink is a shorcut to climb - and people often whispered me "thats not fair" or "that shouldnt be allowed". Note, there were mostly comments, and talk after that was friendly. So not toxic this time but this comment made me remember that. 
---
I did the same thing when I started. Played every class to around 30 and it helped me decide on what I liked or not. I feel like it saved me a lot of time in the end. 
---
Romperoo don't play no *shit.*
---
Thanks! I'll have a try on your fix!
---
Oh wow interesting. I hate even more water combat now.
---
Reaper Minion Master. Made one few days ago to go thru story and achievements that my Ranger could not finish and I am loving it! Has a lot of hp, the minions take the aggro of you, and if you feel like hitting from far than with the greatsword, the axe 2nd skill is strong. In shroud mode 4th skill can easily kill veterans and take a lot of champs hp. I have been completing a lot of achiements with her.
---
Probably some PoF meta, but it is not best gold/hour so people refuse to do it... :(
---
unlimited use tools don't have a level requirement. You just need to place it on a shared slot and it's easy to roll all your characters parked there.
---
Unbreakable gathering tools do not have a level limit.
---
Added! Thanks for the suggestion. Any other tables missing it?
---
Yes lol.
---
What kind of Overlay allows you to have these Heal Numbers on your Screen? Ive seen it b4 but nevet got a response :/
---
Same reason you needed a bunch of expensive sigils to create an armour set.
---
They can't see you if you're transparent *taps forehead*
---
&gt; yesterday i did 100 cm with qb and chrono in 6 mins
---
Nice, you should've recorded and posted it as it'd be the fastest 100 cm to this day. 
---
There is also the chance that you did not do it in 6 mins but hey why would anyone lie about this right?
---
I'm with you on the BD part. Before Diviners gear came out getting high BD without Leadership Runes was hard because you needed a Commanders/Harrier mix (or you'd have to run Chaos). But with Diviners being available now you can easily get 100% BD even without any BD on your Runes.
---
Since DPS won't be that important for a new Chrono player who is going for high BD, I guess it's up to you if you want to either farm DS Meta for Leadership Runes or Thunderhead Peaks Meta for Diviners Insignias/Inscriptions to stat swap your gear.
---
I'd probably recommend Firebrand Runes if you go for high BD and double Well, because it will balance out your Boon output a bit and it gives a lot of Quickness Duration (maintaining Alacrity really shouldn't be a problem with 50%+ BD and double Well).
---
And a scythe as weapon ;) or some massive magic shit
---
Everybody is bringing up all these landmarks in the game that are left over from it like Marinette in Lornar's Pass and the ruin of the Tower of Nightmares in Kessex Hills. I never knew what these were from untill this post. Not being able to play them, in game they are never mentioned.
---
Thank you very much, I just watched the whole thing and it was very informative!
---
Btw I know this is about raiding but I have a few questions about fractals if you don't mind me asking :).
---
1. Can you run the exact same build to do fractals? (Although I assume you don't take the 10-man SoI trait in this case)
---
1. At which point does support chrono get relevant ? I'm only doing pug T1 right now and I felt way more useful as Power Chrono than Support.
---
1. Since I don't have all the necessary stat for now (Boon Duration cap for example) is it even relevant to play this build ?

This is the lowest current price ($37) I could find for both expansions from an official retailer.  The lowest I've ever seen both on sale is $30, so this is a good price.
---
Deluxe editions are nice if you have extra cash, but absolutely not necessary.
---
They dont? Huh, didnt know, thanx xd
---
This. I loved all the random weapon/backpack/armor skins from S3 episodes, not to even mention the stat-selectable trinkets. I have no idea why they chose to go with this shit in S4, especially when they are doing so many other things better this time. 
---
There are servers on EU that dedicated for doing those tracks, for those who don’t want to PvP or screw up the matchmaking due to ppl just want to farm.
---
If your on EU write [Luck] in the search bar for PvP servers. Also read up on wiki so you won’t get kicked out of these servers. (Would send link but on mobile atm)
---
Write in game: /wiki rank farm 
---
Heh i told it was eles causing the bug mostly since we never had it unless we pug and an ele joins even before the other "fixes" were applied. Nobody believed me back then though.
---
Time for me to feel special! :P
---
Same with Forgal and Almorra right now
---
Raids are supposed to be an endgame *challenge*. If you're not willing to learn a fight, or just not skilled enough then you don't belong in a raiding environment to begin with.

Tomato, toemahto, still unavailable.
---
As some have already mentioned, I also can't recommend this guide although I appreciate the time OP has invested in this. Some of the information given is objectively false and will lead to further confusion about how to gear a Chrono.
---
First of all, let's start with the Pack runes. Why are these runes good/meta? Is it because Snow Crows or other high-end guilds like to run with 2 Chrono's and 1 Druid so that they need Fury and Swiftness in one subgroup since Druid can only provide Fury and Swiftness to one subgroup? Nope, that is not the reason. The reason why Pack rune is meta has nothing to do with the active 6th rune bonus. It has to do with the fact that the rune gives 15% BD while giving 175 POWER and 125 PRECISION which are HUGE BONUSES. These bonuses are so huge that even with the 10% extra BD you can get from Leadership runes you will be unable to cover 175 Power/125 Precision by using different gear while staying at the same BD. The 6th rune bonus of Pack runes is just a very, very nice side effect.
---
Now, one could ask another question. Why were Pack runes not meta before? Why did Snow Crows put the build with the Firebrand runes on their website after the SoI change? The answer to this question is interesting. You could IN THEORY still run Pack Runes back then with 2 Mimic Chronos and maintain 100% Alacrity/Quickness while doing more dps than what you would do with Firebrand runes. But this required a build with very low BD which would make it hard to use in some encounters and you couldn't increase BD with Diviner's gear back then (you had to use Commander runes). I assume this is the reason why SC put the build with the Firebrand runes up, since it was much safer to maintain boons (overall higher Quickness duration and double Wells). 
---
I hope this post will help some answer some questions about how to gear a Chrono in the current meta.

After the last windows format, on window mode we could clearly see that his driver is crashing with the msg: Nvidia Display driver stopped working and has recovered.
---
So far it seems that this is the issue which has been hunting him since he started playing, even tho we made sure he installs a fresh copy of windows. Which makes it weird that the driver keeps on crashing even when we installed a clean version of windows.. the tempetures aren't too high too as we were told to check that because it might cause the driver to fail, the temp reached up to 73-74 under presure while playing which is okay according to everywhere i looked online. Any idea to what may cause the driver to crash and reopen?
---
It's a random tyrian eel.

I know that feeling.

I stopped playing for over 2 years regulary.

i started 6 weeks ago and i am in love with that game. Sadly I am still a lone warrior, don't have any friends playing the game with me ;/

You are correct, and I have addressed this elsewhere in this thread and in the comments of my video.
---
But aside from the discussion about pack, the vast majority of the content of this video is correct. With that asterisk applied, new and semi-exp chronos would absolutely benefit from this imo.

I had the same problem with Bercilak, nightmare court is getting really fancy with their color schemes.
---
Hmm what is the reasoning behind the triple support at KC? Is it because the Chrono can stay mid for instant boons and pull the orb at the same time?

You are confusing negativity with disagreement. This sub, and all subs, heavily downvote things that are unpopular. If you go to a Neo Nazi sub and start talking about treating everyone equally, you will be downvoted into oblivion.

Got a build link?
---
Right now I just delete them, fibers or coffee is simply not worth the effort.
---
Pretty much this, except I use pistol/shield instead of hammer. It lets me get tags in so that I can get a few bags, and you can trait to have shield skills give protection to allies, which is super useful. But mostly you just camp healing kit and roll your face across keys 1-5.

You'll get more profit if you stack MF beforehand. You can save a bunch of them, do a RIBA run and then open them all at once.

I really like how this looks and the auto update of Arc+Build Templates is super nice.

Ok. All you did was try to poke holes in my arguments and tell me "ThAt'S yOuR oPiNiOn!" without providing any counters. What a riveting debate. "That fees don't 100% account for inflation doesn't mean they aren't helping" - my favorite example here. You're not arguing FOR anything, just trying to poke holes I what I said based on the assumption that the things you were taught about economics are inherently true everywhere and must apply in a virtual fantasy environment. You seem to be here just to argue, as though you don't have a point.

Linsey Murdock confirmed that was a planned zone for the initial release that got scrapped fairly early in development. Thanks to Linsey, know of [6 maps](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aj6juu/what_ingame_mysteries_still_havent_been_solved/eeuofvp/) that never made it into the final game (though one, Lake Doric, did get re-envisioned for Season 3).
---
Episode bundles come on sale whenever new season starts. The current one just ended and the new will come in 4 months.
---
If you don't wanna wait that long then I'd suggest they place the expac first without the seasons. Surely the grind is doable as they progress deeper into the game. Easily the game content reached 500 hours to finish the core + HoT + PoF got to offer.
---
If they are dying to do the seasons for the story well then, ~150/160 gems per ep is about 50g which isn't that expensive.
---
I see why people took this the wrong way, I'm sorry for wording it this way. The next contest (next month) will be structured better!

That's not fair dude, and you know it. You made them feel guilty.

Yeah, nitpick the smaller releases we got between the bigger ones, and try to pretend that's what LW1 was all about.

All those items you're getting as you progress the story are used for the [Mawdrey backpiece](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mawdrey). Dulfy has a step-by-step [guide](http://dulfy.net/2014/08/13/gw2-cultivated-vine-backpiece-guide/) for it. It's a pretty neat scavenger hunt and an ascended backpiece as a reward is nice imo. For the Chaos Orb, you can try asking during the Fire Elemental if anyone has a charged key, so they can trigger it for you. It's more likely of this happening if this boss is part of the daily achievement. When I did this, I practically spammed F as I walked around and eventually picked one up.

Dialogue choices won't affect the story instances. After the personal story, all players go through the same story steps regardless of dialogue options. There might be a small reference here and there on your character's race or profession, nothing major though.

They can clone the old maps and make us access them through Mist portals instead. So, a portal to Toxic Kessex Hills, with the tower still up. Meanwhile, present day Kessex Hills remains the same, no changes.

LW1 was good because it was open world, instancing it would ruin it completely.

---
Do you imagine you Charr having sex wit a quaggan or a tengu? If not, don't worry, you just have good taste. 
---
This is true of course but I don't think you can gain a lot of dps from Diviner Ren or FB by lowering their BD.
---
As far as I know the difference between Diviner Ren/Berserker Ren is around 11% since Ren is critcapped with Diviner gear + Spotter anyway. You could also go with a Condi Renegade with 20-30% BD but that's also not a great solution in my mind. When it comes to FB, I am not sure if the condi version can gain a lot of dps by either dropping the Quickness Mantra or FMW or by going Renegade runes. Power version would probably benefit more from that.
---
While I agree that 2xFB+1Ren has its problems when it comes to boon application and CC, I feel like the dps will always be better than Chrono+FB+Ren if you can pull it off.
---
This wouldn't happen
---
The WvW borderland gates were something different. Charrikayu is referring to [the original Coriolis Plaza](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Coriolis_Plaza_(old).jpg) which was eventually used for new LA's city gates.
---
I mostly do all story stuff on a Thief. It has good mobility/cleave, can stealth for some of the more pesky achievements, and is relatively easy to play (Slap on Invigorating Precision + Signet of Malice, and as long as you keep AAing, you should never die). 
---
I've recently started playing power chrono and that's been really good as well (Minus this last episode, as phantasms seem to refuse to work on just about everything). You've got good quickness/alacrity/might/fury uptimes by yourself due to the traits and the phantasm spam, as well as good cleave/burst. I usually run with Sword/Sword-GS because it has really good burst but you can easily replace the GS for Focus if you need pulls.
---
You can reach the opposite side of the bridge and get stuck in invisble texture far from portal, can't reach the portal itself.
---
Sooo being all noob to this kinda stuff, what's the chances of anet being upset if I used this? Just the idea of a potential ban gives me palpatations but I want better performance goddammit xD 
---
&gt;The original intention of those gates was indeed as a way of future proofing part of the city's design. Part of the reason that the asura there didn't have any concrete information about their destinations was because we didn't yet know where the story of Guild Wars 2 would take us, so they were marked as "under construction" until we started developing Living World, and then from there the necessity of having them shifted as we figured out our content delivery strategy and asura gates didn't really play as big a role as we expected them to.

Marcello begs for his life, while Hobo-Tron first tries to sell Marcello out, and then offers to be Scarlet's lackey.  And, yes, that's what got him in trouble with the Seraph.

Aw no! Don't feel bad! I totally get what you're saying and it's fine. : )
---
You're not funny, or clever. 
---
Yes, just as any other way people choose to play this game. Imagine that. People can actually decide by themselves how much effort they want to invest in a game. And it doesn't make you a superior human being for investing more effort then others. I know it is important for your self-esteem to feel superior in a game. Which is rather pathetic. But just because it is important to you, doesn't mean it is actually important.
---
So...let me get this straight...OP asks for advice on which classes are superior for Achievement Farming in Living Story. You respond with the childish, troll behavior of L2P. Someone calls you out and you proceed to further climb down the immature “grow up”/“no u” response. 
---
I’m impressed. I wonder if you also message people that kill you in WvW...You know, if you do that sort of thing.

Very confused and generally uneducated on the topic but I thought that Anet said DX12 wouldn't really improve fps performance? How does this do it then? I know this is not the same as the game running native  DX12 but if this is seeing gains then native DX12 should be better right?

AFIK Taco is just a transparent overlay window, so it should work fine.

Why shouldn't it? The only rason you bitching here is because it is absolutely imperative for you to feel superior to all those Plebs who didnt manage it. Which is even more ridiculous considering we have actual hardcore content in the game. So you could just go do that. But that's not enough. For you, all content has to cater to you and your personal preference.
---
That's exactly the attitude Wildstar failed with. By completely missing the fact that players like you are a tiny minority. Even if they make up the majority of whining about difficulty in Forums.
---
Yes, people will use the binaries, but the source code is there for people to be able to check if there is any weird things hidden in it, the fact that the source code is not available without having to manually unpack the binary for it does make it seem even more likely that there is something weird in it.

Sure, to a degree skill affects the viability of a class. But it would be incredibly naive to assume that certain classes won’t be more viable in certain content, regardless of skill level. You seem to be implying the answers are varying, yet if really read the comments, there appears to be a pattern. Necro, Mesmer and Ranger being the more popular choices.

As far as your “snowflake” comment, you do appear to be missing the point. I’m not offended. As stated, it wasn’t directed at me and I wasn’t the one being childish and implying OP was just incapable of playing a class. I’m merely pointing out your comment provided no beneficial information to OP regarding his request. It was, in fact, a childish response. 
---
I called you out, you became instantly offended and began attacking yet again. It’s really not hard to comprehend.
---
But again...the point...there are classes that are significant better at the content that OP was referring to. The pattern in the comments also indicates the same. End of story. :) 
---
I remember them saying that about DX11, when that was a commonly suggested update years ago. Not sure if they ever said DX12 would not improve performance.
---
1. Daily Fractals + CMs = 1h
---
2. HoT Metas (VB + TD + AB)  = 1h
---
3. Daily Crafting, Home &amp;  GH Gathering, Daily PvP = 1h?
---
No source code so this is potentially just a malware anet don't want to be held responsible if anything bad happens
---
None, if it does what the author claims.
---
There are, however, considerations to be had about the stability of an early release of a tool like this - you may have more crashes, at any random times (both under heavy load and when you would never even be worried about crashing before). 
---
4. Read README.md before doing any actions, i will not respond on errors that originate from not reading it.
---
9. Really, really read README.md if you plan to use it.
---
And again read that file on how to install, please!
---
No problem. It is also visible in it that one of his side "horns" + part of mouth is missing.
---
I will definetly try this out the instant I get on my pc. Does it work with ArcDPS and reshade/gw2hook? 
---
Are CMs worthwhile to do? It’s something that I’ve always looked at, but never taken the leap to do them. I generally just do T4 and recs.
---
The only thing I actually noticed in game was that we sure fucked up his eye. So all this is quite interesting. Thanks again! :)
---
One of my main problems currently is that running GW2 often overtaxes my cpu and I run into thermal issues that cause random freezing ( I assume by throttling cpu functions to mitigate heat inducing processes). Would this sort of thing be something that would reduce the cpu burden that I am faced with so I am not often hitting 100% usage? I suppose what I am wondering is if the cpu usage I see on task manager is based on all cores or single core peaks? Thanks!
---
Interesting, I might try this out later. Question: by "high draw call load conditions," are you referring to more general situations like high numbers of particle effects or high player counts specifically? I seem to recall one of the devs mentioning that slowdown due to player count was a problem intrinsic to the engine and changing DirectX versions wouldn't make a difference in that area, so for players who already have powerful setups your solution might not have much of an impact in those cases.
---
You are right, it was mostly about DX11 and a post from 3 years ago about the DX9 situation. If DX12 is more viable than 11 though then maybe this is something they should really consider.
---
Yeah. I'm not running code with a Russian readme (Sorry, I've dealt with too much shady code from there finding its way into systems without anyone explicitly installing it) without being able to have a look at the guts and see that what we're told it's doing compiles to the binary that is provided.
---
I'm a sysadmin and I write code every day that would make Jesus cry for my sins, but that's no excuse to not let other people see my work if it's helpful. Either this is shady as fuck or OP needs to get over themselves and acknowledge that everyone writes trash code before they make it better; then they should learn to shrug off the haters who think code is just birthed whole and immaculate into the world.
---
Hell, if the full source and commit history were online, people could probably start hopping in to help with issues that have and are plaguing the development of a non-alpha build and I don't know too many legit devs who don't appreciate getting free solutions to their problems.
---
Not saying that we should be mean to OP and shun their efforts or work, but being the sysadmin that I am, I can't just sit around and not advise users when they're about to throw all best practices out the window and do something that is at best a bad idea, at worst a nice way to lose your account and/or potentially anything that you've trusted to the care of your computer.
---
i have read it, and if root folder is "Guild wars 2" idk where im making a mistake , between clicking install.bat and launching the game 
---
This is brilliant, Andy should hire you and put the resources behind your project to make this translation layer part of the proper game! Once ArcDPS is supported, I’ll make this a permanent installation. GW2 overheats and under utilizes my 12 Core dual D700 Mac Pro (Win 10 Boot Camp), can’t wait to play around with this. 
---
I've been coming to this subreddit for years, they used to be good about the low-effort image macros/memes. Seems to have slackened in the past half year or so. 
---
What...does that show? The dragon is VASTLY different to kralk...
---
What art rule? There is not rule prohibiting art.
---
Draw calls is anything drawable: shadows, objects, characters, particles, ui, effects, etc.
---
So high draw call is like: all max, looking at bank in LA
---
What the foo ?
---
Eldritch Horrors in the Mist. Are Eldritch Horror real in Guild Wars 2 universe? 
---
I care if that causes at least one person to crash during every boss pull in raids. Performance means nothing if the app is not stable.
---
That's not Kuunavang
---
&gt; I might start just outright deleting them. 
---
I suggest you do.  I just drag them out of my inventory window.
---
The only real reason to do them is to get long-term prestige rewards (red infusions, account augmentation titles), or if you want additional challenge. That's your call to make.
---
I started doing them about a month ago and find them fun. It can be frustrating getting started because you will mainly be limited to training/learning groups until you get more kill proofs, at which point more groups will start to accept you. Skilled PUGs or coordinated statics make them a cakewalk, for the most part, but bad instabilities can make some runs very frustrating.
---
If you want to get started, I suggest picking a non-dps meta role to main (support/heals/banners) in order to learn the mechanics. Many fights are effectively DPS races, and the group as a whole will suffer if DPS is low, so you should only try to play a DPS once you understand the mechanics of each fight, and after you have practiced your rotations. Also, bring tons of cc (including consumables that give you cc bundles).
---
&gt;It seems to be a good link to the Commander's role as Aurene's source of hope too - To never lose faith no matter how many times you lose.
---
The Commander themselves also came back from the death, remember.
---
Isn't the last part "cease dropping loot after a certain number of kills" a bit too much? If mobs are only dropping loot inside the radii then the event will progress and go to the next step (so there will only be a specific amount of loot, to begin with).
---
Ginyu theory!  It would be interesting.  I will continue to believe that her death was part of the plan as Glint saw it, and we just haven't seen how the final dominos actually fall (or we don't know what we've seen yet).
---
Of all the possibilities, this one has the benefit of clearly no longer needing to fight or encounter Kralk again at all (because I don't think you build that encounter if you're going to do another one against the same dragon in the upcoming episodes); if this is true, he's already dead and we've already won.
---
The one proposed by the mods earlier this week that was met with a pretty big push-back from the actual users. 
---
Thank you for proving they could improve the things without rewriting entirely the engine.  
---
BUT... Seven lover here... no way for a similar tool with DX11 ?
---
Aren't the HoT ones non-repeatable?  That's probably why.  Also the PoF tracks are pretty good for materials.  Yes the material coffers are completely useless, but that's pretty much it.  Oh and all the eyes of Kormir I guess.  
---
Nicely done!
---
Oh wait...

Look at that smiling puppie! Isn't he cute when he has fun?
---
i know, that was my point. No reason to say more than that.
---
G-sync will be in effect only on fullscreen windowed, on any not fullsceen windows it should stick to "system screen composition time", but you should know it better, cause that is what docs say =). I just surprised about 30 FPS flat, it should not be that fixed.
---
For crashes: pointing a method to reproduce is enough :D
---
Illegal aliens =/= immigrants. Nice False equivalency. Go back to creeping on people posting their charr and larping as literal fantasy stand-ins for nazis
---
Maybe they should introduce an \[Art\] filter so people like OP can filter them out ? I love the art posts btw. 
---
Maybe there's a plot twist and you're actually right, but at that point that would be cheap.
---
Add me in GW2. IGN Dosch.1894
---
If you want we can go through some of the content together or with teleport to friend I can show you some amazing spots! I'll try to keep my drawing streak going and hopefully I'll be able to motivate more people to see the great work the art department of anet is putting into this game. (Also the rest of the team!!)
---
Lions Arch can transform into a massive Lobster, final episode of this season is a power rangers style Lobster Vs Kralk battle.
---
You finally posted it! I was an alpha tester for this thing. Performance was increased, but inability to use arcdps was a dealbreaker for me.
---
Don't accuse me for random stuff, wtf....
---
Go home, if you're drunk, but stop bothering ppl.
---
Please just sign up for 2FA. You can use SMS or an authentication app.  
---
You can also get a weekly BL key by completing any lvl10 personal story. Faster one is the human, you'll find plenty of guides on youtube. You just need 8 tomes of knowledge every week, and less than 15 min if done right.
---
There's also a key at lvl 40 and 70 of the personal story every week, but it's a longer investment.
---
I agree. We don’t all need this shit.
---
Mimic is better on paper, but double well helps make up for mistakes on either your part or your squads'. But no matter which you take, the basic rotation ends up being pretty similar - I like to break it down because when you originally look at it on snowcrows it seems very daunting :)
---
Man, that pic brings back memories... 👍
---
Virustotal is pretty much useless.
---
True. Might do some more personal story for some keys. Those shoulders will be mine!!!
---
i like how i get downvoted because people dont get the joke
---
Be carefull when using the word "Game design", it adds a different expectation to the conversation instead of just discussing the game
---
Bifrost was my first too, I made it about a year ago. I remember being /thrilled to bits/ when I first equipped it. I hopped around all night, showing off my pretty rainbows!
---
But a year later, the shine has mostly worn off on pretty much all of my legendaries, which I now have 5 of. Even Xiquatl. 
---
The footfalls still really do it for me, though. They are a great touch. 
---
season 5 confirmed to be called "Bubbles Rising". ^*bathtub ^not ^included
---
So you rather see the same text questions being repeated?
---
So I just put this on, you will know if it works because there will be a lot of shader compilation going on right away. If you run fullscreen windowed then you will notice the game launches in a little bit of a different way.
---
Loading screens seem faster.
---
Camera jank is still there sadly.
---
Vsync on windowed fullscreen when you reach refresh rate is there and working and it's fantastic.
---
I'll update this when I play with it around more.
---
I don't want OC on my front page, I only want the 754747th post of "I just built my first legendary!"
---
Quaggan is here to oooo seaweed and foo you up, and Quaggan is all out of seaweed...
---
There's still a chance those crashes could be fixed even without a source code rewrite.
---
It's always possible they ban you with how open ended their 3rd party program policy is. If this does what it claims than you could argue getting extra fps is an advantage over someone else and is a banable offense.
---
However the real reason not to use this is it's such a terrible idea to run executables without any source code from some rando on the internet. You have absolutely no idea what this could be doing on your system.
---
I think if you open source it, we will be able to do the cleanup and improve it as a community.
---
I'm speaking as an OSS supporter and enthusiast
---
At this point they probably stopped working on the engine over the barely neccesary and are moving to only support it with story content, while the rest of the teams work on their next project.
---
You can use the google Authenticator, so you don‘t need sms.

For me it crashes when loading a character.

Crash.txt says

0 | "d912pxy\_swapchain::Swap" | hr = 887A0005 
---
1 | "texture object create failed" | hr = FFFFFFFF 
---
0 | "ring buffer overrun" | hr = FFFFFFFF 
---
0 | "can't close command list" | hr = 80070057 
---
Note: I only got 10 GB RAM, not 16
---
Thanks for the link, I'll be sure to read up on it
---
Could be right, the 70+ devs that worked on PoF are doing what? Has to be another project of some sort.
---
Yea I had this before. You should lower the number of system interrupts the mouse sends on moving (there is a name for this but I forgot) 
---
Mordrem had such nightmare potential (and in cases, they truly went for it). Still can't see Mordrem trolls without being utterly disgusted at how bees have built their hives in a living creature. I am glad you're picking up on the notion and keeping the horror alive. Man, I almost wish we'd encounter some new types somewhere... 
---
Thx for report. You can try to wait for shader compilation or use clean_shaders.bat and wait for shader compilation for things to show up properly. Note that compilation can take a significant amount of time.
---
HW spec helping a lot, proving some my thoughts.
---
keep in mind that without d912pxy in game root folder it will not work.
---
what hw you use?
---
We foo foo foo all day up here in the Great White North.
---
&gt;It's fine, I'll clean up these nested `for` loop recursive callbacks eventually...
---
I hate this particular theory (Aurene branding Kralk and maybe taking him over) because I don't want Aurene to be trapped in the body of a half-wrecked, age-old, twisted, magic-addicted behemoth that can't go anywhere without accidentally killing something, 
---
but we will see. 
---
That's some pretty crappy logic. People use binaries from sources they *trust*. You, OP, are not inherently one of them.
---
...someday...maybe... :P
---
Yea, not maliciously. I wouldn’t jump on their body or anything. Just keeping them in downstate while I held a point. The point is winning the game after all.
---
1: There are already two massive threads about this.
---
2:
---
&gt;Lets complain here and maybe they'll undo that unnecessary change that only annoys its most fidel player base while doing nothing positive in any way.
---
I think people are vastly overestimating the amount of the player base being affected by this. And it is doing positive things: It forces people to care about their own security rather than having their email and password in PLAIN TEXT, which is stupid as hell. 
---
Here's a good question: why not sign up for it?
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Polling rate.
---
YMMV though. Personally, I've never noticed a difference on any of my desktops.
---
Should I level up Scrapper or Holosmith first? Both interest me and I'm not sure which to pick first.
---
Also is Scrapper a good support in PvE? Looking at all PvE content, but if there's a certain group it's better/worse in please specify.
---
There are the same amount of threads with "I changed my phone number and support isn't answering."
---
this is why 2 factor authentification exists i could litterally post my password here and it wouldnt matter besides me gettinga  ton of sms
---
Bear?
---
Absolutely, if he doesn't release the source code. I don't care if it's "a mess". ANet's security department's job in this is, as they've always said, to verify that this won't endanger accounts. Not releasing the source code is not going to help.
---
this. And you don't need to wait 3 weeks for support if you change your number.
---
ArenaNet.
---
Give this person a job and pay them well.
---
Steve is the Labyrinthine Horror, who gives blessings of calcium and strong bones. 
---
Absolutely. DX10 and DX11 added more optimized ways to do pretty things like subsurface scattering, screenspace reflections and tesselation. All of those were the major selling points.
---
DX12 (and Vulkan) are branded more toward allowing games to draw more stuff by smarter CPU and GPU utilization. Also workload sharing that can reduce bottlenecks.
---
The devs might have said you can't just slap it on and get a performance increase, which is reasonable.
---
However, the OP of this thread may have just proven that there is a way to implement it that doesn't require tearing the game apart and rebuilding it.
---
It is more a matter of a state of mind. Not everything have 2 factor authentication. 
---

I removed that part since there were some leftovers from the install.bat I used.

The way I wrote it definitely doesn't launch the game properly.

Hahaha well played sir

did you just assume kralkatorikks gender?

Gonna second this. This is *extremely* shady, and OP's excuse - that most people 'use' binaries, not source code - is beyond shaky. I'd ping /u/ChrisCleary, but he's deleted his account, so...
---
Pressing Y now, sir
---
now if only someone will do this for win7 and dx11 for my desktop. my laptop is win10 and i hate playing on it, every update alert minimizes the game and forces me to update during the play session. tbh its been over a year since i even turned my laptop on since i installed win10
---
Reminds me of pride from FMA. It looks amazing 
---
P7x64.dll is this: http://baical.net/p7.html
---
Yeah, no, I'm not using it before I can compile the source myself. I see no reason why a telemetry sending library should be there.
---
Yep, just did the tomb raiding in Thunderhead Peak and had an odd feeling something was missing - it was the wooden platforms. The collision is still there, but they didn't appear / looked like your screenshot.
---
Hmm. Well, if I get around to trying it out I'll report my results, but my gut feeling is that it won't be a huge improvement for me.
---
I learned that the hard way haha my opponent let me get really close to fully healed and started hitting me.  Sat out of combat for a solid 2min+ rofl 
---
The only time I’d say it’s worth to struggle and stay alive is in a big team fight and one of your opponents is down too so it’s possible to get a rally but other than that, it’s not worth it.
---
insane fps increase, hope in will work with arc dps soon 
---
We know that just isn't true as the story content has brought with it numerous engine updates.
---
What a beautiful concept and art!! Please tell me there is a place I can see more of this art style?~ Just stunning
---
If only!!!
---
The sad answer is that Scrapper just isn't very good in PvE. 
---
We all want it to be, and there are some interesting support builds, but every class does support better than Scrapper.
---
Which is strange because anytime i change my phone number i literally get a reply from support within 30 minutes to an hour.
---
So use the app. 
---
thank ;;
---
What would you recommend, bigfatwaifu?
---
It's better than nothing and I don't have access to enterprise virus checkers. 
---
Which ones, that actually change the way that the engine performs, or add new graphical rendering features?
---
Neither of which I want to consent to. Telemetry, in my opinion, should be an explicit opt-in, and its presence should be well-disclosed.
---
hey so i've been having a lot of trouble getting decent numbers with this rotation and to what i can see pretty much everything i'm doing is exactly the same as what you're doing, but i've never seen over 32k first number and 31k final number, what are some major things you think could go wrong with this?
---
Of course there is a massive difference between them, and unfortunately in these times everyone must take these kind of thing seriously.
---
What if there is a cryptolocker inside?
---
None..this does not give any advantage to be bannable. But if you want to be sure you can wait for the author to release the source code to be absolutely sure it is doing that he say it is doing.  
---
How come Spirit Watch was like removed from the game? I never see it in ranked or un-ranked.
---
The leather farm is mostly for people who want leather, from my experience. It's not enormously profitable, but is good way of saving money, if that makes sense. 
---
I have it on all of my alts. There's literally no reason not to.
---
Can we please not do this unfunny bullshit?
---
You start gearing up another character... 
---
That! 
---
It's the new Andy Serkis skin from the gemstore!
---
(no really, Korius here is a garbage person. I can attest to that.)
---
I am suspecting that the author may have taken some ideas from Wine that has a dx12 to open GL translator. If that is true his code might have benefited by the maturity coming from Wine a bit. 
---
My daily routine tends to be PvP and WvW for my dailies and the progress on my dungeon reward tracks (they were recently added to the unlockers and I don't want to get them from that!)
---
the rampart set is right now. should stay until next tuesday i think
---
This sort of reminds me of stuff out of Gyo 
---
I don't know about the no art rule you're referencing, but there is a rule against low-effort/-value posts.  
---
I believe there was a post out there on the forums awhile back about this. Guile said they pretty much never intend to remove it, and you can only have 5 accounts per phone number/authenticator.    
---
Another giant fuck you to the multiple account owner players.

What purpose does that library serve then?

As a person on the internet, you must run plenty of other closed source programs day by day. Wanna run this program I have for you?
---
For those who already launched your game with this dll, I guess changing your password would be the safe thing to do right now.
---
What is a telemetry sending library? :o
---
Are you sure that's the kind of response you want to make? 'cause now I'm even more suspicious, given that you made no attempt to convince me that I'm wrong.

Random question: Has anyone tried this on linux with wine?
---
i like how confident you are in forming these ideas about me when we've literally never talked beyond a commission that was botched due to your incompetence and unprofessionalism.  but sure, align yourself with morally bankrupt people and continue involving unrelated parties to this matter instead of talking to me directly just so you can further nurture your victim complex when i haven't even accosted you and so you can continue harboring your grudge because you're so easily upset by the idea of someone playing a flame legion character (:
---
additional capital, no, not without NCSoft backing for the long term future of the IP.  If GW2 continues to be stable operating with a clear enough direction, which the LW Season system seems to be, maybe there will be more confidence to let them allocate or bring in additional resources.  
---
Obviously it's a major decision, stick with the GW2 engine and allocate resources to overhaul it completely and shelve a sequel in favor of a WoW structure of sticking to the same base for an additional 5-10 years or allocate said resources towards a new engine/v2 and PoC a GW3 project around it and banking on a majority of the existing userbase continuing onto the new game.
---
&gt;You, OP, are not inherently one of them.
---
However that would instantly change to the polar opposite as soon as you open up the source code because you'd signal us that there's nothing malicious inside that you could want to hide.
---
Bonus trust points if your builds are [reproducible](https://reproducible-builds.org/)! :)
---
How has this not been fixed??? Reported this the first night and I've waited until post patch to play through with a second char because its so bad. Constant 180 degree flicker if the camera. Makes me feel really sick but besides that it's a Massive massive epilepsy trigger in the Crystal dragon instance wtf!!!!
---

Ooh, what's your charr look like in game? I'd love to see a comparison if there is one. Do you do commissions?
---
&gt;G-sync will be in effect only on fullscreen windowed
---
I'm interested, why doesn't it work in exclusive fullscreen?
---
&gt;just surprised about 30 FPS flat, it should not be that fixed.
---
Yeah, it should be triple buffered, not double buffered; isn't 3x V-Sync enforced by Windows?
---
The emailed code is an implementation of 2fa.  Not sure why people seem to forget that it is the default.
---
Silver fed is still better for salvaging gear that can drop ectos. There was a post about comparison of all 3 kits, including copper fed.
---
There are many achievements that are tricky to get. Some of them is to survive, while some others are about dodging aoes .. 
---
I have a thief / necromancer and I've done all the achievs in PvE with these 2. 
---
Oh yeah and it's that bad it just made me loose eligibility for the timed kill achi because you can't see where the hell you are going have to use the slash stuck command and then be inactive for a while. 
---
Looks awesome, what program are you using?
---
sorry, buddy. take the time you need to take care of yourself. i only recently started using it and it was a great help for having an NA and EU account setup where i didn't have to constantly re-input my credentials.
---
Telemetry is when an application sends some usage info or statistics to the developer. It can be stuff like: when and how often do you launch the application, which of its functions do you use the most, what is you hardware. It can also be stuff like how are you interacting with its UI, which buttons are you clicking, how are you moving your mouse etc. It can be anonymized, it can be not.
---
The point is: you don't know. It can potentially be anything the developer desires, and all you can do is trust the developer that they aren't using it with malicious intent. For all we know, this may be a keylogger. Is there any proof that it is? No. Is there any proof that it isn't? Nope. Opening up source code will provide that proof.
---
Alas, telemetry is being increasingly used by many major applications, both desktop and especially mobile, and even websites. But at least in the case of major companies like Adobe, Microsoft, if any misuse of mishandling of the data will occur, you can bring them to court thanks to their public face, while in the case of an anonymous developer, it might as well be a hit-and-run scam. Not saying that it is. But it doesn't harm to be careful. I personally view any telemetry that isn't opt-in and isn't advertised as a breach of privacy.
---
You can check the specifications of your particular GPU online for the maximum supported DX version but I'm pretty sure all 700 series GTX cards support DX12.
---
Silver is obsolete if you use the rune salvage AND regularly use mystic salvage kits.  If you only use 1 or the other,  than a silver is still useful for various reasons.
---
fuuuuck off. You were a person who was hard to work with and I didnt want to draw your murder-fetish.

&gt;3) You use it on your own risk.

Forgive me if I'm a little sceptical.
---
2-factor. I'd like to see him try, LMAO.
---
I mean you're giving them your phone number to sell or lose in a data hack, that seems like a reason not to? 
---
Will you post your phone number here? There's literally no reason not to.
---
It also had one of the best tracks in the soundtrack. I get always pretty nostalgic thinking about ruined LA. 
---
not addressing his concerns directly, but instead making a stupid comment?  
---
yeah, fuck you. no way i'm using this.
---
No, it sounds like "A guy in the street wants to sell me a security camera, without telling me he might remote access it. What could possibly go wrong?"
---
Undisclosed telemetry and OP isn't saying what he's collecting even after it's exposed?  Yeah, fuck this.
---
Like someone else said, you can set up Windows 10 so that it only updates when you tell it to update, and never gives you popups about it.
---
he is more likely to be father and mother in one unless you know who glints mother is or aurenes father
---
2fa through authenticator works great. No more waiting for sms or mail to come
---
Is there a story behind this one? I would love to hear it. The faces being recognizable as former persons and there being two of them seems to say there is.
---
If it is malicious that may not be good enough. If it is malicious the only way to be 100% safe is to perform a clean installation and then change ALL the passwords. A virus scan might be enough instead of a clean install but it might not. Nuking everything and then changing the passwords will work though.
---
I don't own a cell phone.
---
I mean they could be working on an expansion...
---
Why does ANET need my phone number when they already use my email address for the same purpose? 
---
Yes, please. As someone that doesn't even won a cell phone, this constant reminder is annoying AF.
---
Yeah that’s gonna be a no from me dawg. 
---
&gt;Taimi is going to need to build a bigger ~~nest in~~ Sun's Refuge o.O
---
FTFY
---
same happened to me in personal story and caudecus manor story
---
Berserker is far better DPS.
---
Reaper is the tankiest class in the game.  Shroud essentially gives it 2 HP bars, plus you can have minions to draw agro away.  You are plenty tanky, I would highly recommend going zerker to kill things faster.
---
Are you being serious? Because that's a fairly ignorant comment. Of course there's a difference between activating SMS 2FA and posting my phone number on Reddit. Regardless, it's not even applicable to this situation because /u/Something_Memorable already signed their main account up for SMS 2FA, which means Anet has it already.
---
&gt; What happened to the rule that was supposed to be enforced?
---
Which rule would that be? https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules
---
Except SMS 2FA is easy as hell to get through
---
Hundred*, and shit was going on in my life that I couldnt disclose due to legal reasons (father having an affair and family ripped apart, lawyers didn't want us saying anything and I was emotionally messed up), smaller commissions were easier to finish within a day of instead of big ones. And it wasn't half assed, it wasn't finished yet, but you wanted me to start over! You didn't like me drawing how I drew things, you wanted it to be exact and I spent more time on it than I needed on your grocery list of changes, which unfortunately, is not what I do. You picked the wrong artist to draw what you wanted. You picked the wrong artist for what you wanted. I wanted to try but your murder fetish was too yucky to draw. You got all your money back, too, so you can back off.
---
I disclosed this to "unrelated parties" but I guess he didn't tell you. Now stop fucking calling people pedos, and fuck off. You're such a pile of vitriol, it's not cool.
---
You can 2fa without a phone
---
OP doesn't provide source code, hasn't had it checked by anet, and the binaries include a P7 library which enables telemetry and trace data to be collected.  
---
big nope.
---
She's sleek. I love how you handled her horns. Perspective with the horns is something I'm still working on myself.
---
how is it safer ? the credentials are still written, and accessible. Only now its on a launcher, right when whoever coming across it would look for it, while it was in a shortcut's parameter where only people knowing this is a thing would look at. 
---
so in both cases, whoever has access to my computer has access to my gw2 account. still wondering how safer that is
---
also we had a choice to do this "stupid as hell" thing, while now we have no choice. only for that reason, this removal should be cancelled. i understand and own my actions.
---
I’m surprised Anet still hasn’t added all of the issues you mention to be features within the game already?? Raids have been out for awhile now
---
Possible, if so then it's the most time they've put into an expansion since launch because we won't be seeing one this year, season 4 rolls into season 5.
---
i'd love a link to that post, since i've been looking for "command line" and only saw the post with a script to bypass that.
---
would be nice to have it linked by default in this kind of case.
---
[Living World](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World)
---
Who's the other Charr she's assimilated? I didn't see it at first, but now that I have, the creepy factor just jumped up another notch.
---
anet should just give us the option to disable the launcher altogether back...
---
Ok, on what server data is pushed, and what data is pushed?
---
Oh it's pushed onto your hard disk in P7logs directory, oh my!
---
Probably is not a shure, so you should prove your insults on someone doing something bad before doing them.
---
Easy, delete the character.
---
Sure beats SMB on NES
---
They don't have my phone number at all?
---
Same to you, mate.
---
They said that they don’t sign up for **SMS** because they don’t have a cell phone.  They never said (nor implied) that they don’t use email for the 2fa.  They were answering someone else’s question and you made (from what it appears to be) an assumption that they had no second factor at all.
---
Good god, this is a nightmare.
---
*KONMARI'S YOUR INVENTORY!*
---
Not really, you have bank and you have mat bank that you can deposit anywhere in the world.
---
It’s just poor management from player or maybe new and don’t know about the deposit function ^^ 
---
GW2 don’t do such thing ^^ 
---
But we're talking about getting SMS 2FA for alt accounts.
---
SHUT UP and take my gems already!!
---
Is this some weird US-only thing?
---
I can't recall ever giving ANet my phone number, and I can't find anywhere to add it in the security settings on my account either. I've used Google Authenticator for my account since the day they added support for it, though.
---
I pass out at the sight of needles, tattoos just don't bother me. I have about 30 hours worth of tattoo work and none of it has bothered me. Avoid bony areas and it's just a little pain :) apart from the cost.. That's pain. 
---
Got maybe another 5 hours left to finish the Eir side but it's going to look amazing once done. 
---
SMS doesn't really add that much security these days. SMS are unencrypted, the  "hardest" part would be getting your cell phone number/service provider in the first place.
---
Aquabreather should just be a wardrobe slot :(
---
You can never build a virus scanner that can detect all viruses. [Source with proof in the discussion](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/201992/has-it-been-mathematically-proven-that-antivirus-cant-detect-all-viruses)
---
If VirusTotal says something is bad, then you can trust it. However if VirusTotal says something is fine then it might not be fine. In that case use your own judgement to see whether or not you trust the file. If you don't trust it, don't download it. Points have been made here in the comments about the safety of the files OP posted (it sends data to a server somewhere and the source code is not available so no one can verify what it actually does) so personally I suggest you do not trust it.
---
Yeah I feel you bro. It’s hard to play the game like you used to without your old friends. I suggest trying to bond with a guild or other players you might meet. It’s not the same but it’s a start
---
Am I getting paid to educate you? Fuck off. As a consumer you should try turning on your brain now and then.
---
..If his deposits arent full that is =P
---
I focus my time on a larger goal and challenges i set for my self.
---
Over the last few years there have been different goals and challenges.
---
From focusing on getting spirit weapons for my guardian, phantasmal weapons for my mesmer, making new 0 death characters over and over and over again with specific gear  acquisition and a specific limited leveling route and much more.
---
I have multiple very old characters i dont actually play but keep for storage and some other different things so its easy for me to do the quick pve daily for 2 gold (also big spender daily!).
---
So heres a check list i usually go trough before starting to play on my latest "challenge" character:
---
* Get daily for 2 gold and some writs of experience
---
* Gather draconic mons trees around the JP on 1 character, often asking help for a quick arid devourer that gives extra currency.
---
* Gather a few bloodstone rubies on another character, often asking for help for a quick "meta" event that gives extra rubies
---
* Run across the seashore/lake in Sirens landing to collect a bunch of Orrian Pearls on a 3rd character.
---
* I usually do a few easy LS3 dailies such as "get 10 unbound floaty magic orbs" for extra loot
---
* I get on my current challenge character and pick up t3+t2 guild hall gathering nodes,+ all of my home instance loot before i continue to play trough the challenge with it.
---
Depending on the festival, i also blaze trough a route on that one as well. Such as the karma farm during wintersday being 3 JPs, 3 bell songs, orphan runs. I also get the 3 dailies to progress for the exotic weapon. Currently i just pick up the 16 lucky envelopes and maybe do a few dailies if they are instant.
---
I dont really farm much as im an old veteran that has most of the things i need and actually ever wanted as well as a good sum of gold.
---
I wanted to make a legendary WvW armor but the most efficient route would require playing 3h of wvw per day, for 22 weeks or so...so i just reserve wvw for a few hours per week instead.
---
My long term goal is to settle for 1 character that finally finishes all of my challenges. I also wanted to craft Eternity on that character as a epic legendary final journey/reward...buuut more and more i keep making characters that dont actually use eternity so im kinda 50-50 on that. 
---
He made it like this for karma. He has two incomplete stacks of ectos.
---
And if you are not willing to give people stepping stones to get there, than the mode will die.
---
Looks pretty normal to me. No problem found
---
https://imgur.com/a/NZKNVhj for album. It's a star-field reused all over this game, but those two stars are always in the same Southwestern spot and very distinctively red and yellow. Why only those two? There are no other stars that absolute in color, and then they're right next to one another. Perhaps coincidence, but I feel there's something more to it.
---
[as i originally said](https://i.imgur.com/Z6aTCed.png), if you had shit going on in your life, then that's all you'd have to say and i'd understand.  i never asked for details, merely a reply to know if you were still active.  but instead you chose to just ignore my messages for over a year.
---
&gt; You didn't like me drawing how I drew things
---
if i didn't like the way you drew charr why would i have commissioned you to begin with? 
---
as for my "grocery list of changes," they resulted from a lack of communication on your part.  most of the changes i requested were flagrant inaccuracies that could have been fixed early on, but again, you were silent for over a year so i could not suggest any edits until you suddenly showed up with a colored piece at the end that i had no input on.  drawing something flat out incorrectly has nothing to do with me being picky about your style.  
---
&gt; I wanted to try but your murder fetish was too yucky to draw.
---
so pinning down tied up charr = murder? lol
---
&gt; You got all your money back, too, so you can back off.
---
[i offered to let you keep the money](https://i.imgur.com/jhSYR07.png) and you declined, so don't suggest that i was clamoring for a refund
---
&gt; Now stop fucking calling people pedos
---
show me where i called someone (which you're clearly taking personally to mean *you*) a pedo
---
again, just like before, you refuse to communicate when i've been perfectly open to talking.  instead, you've chosen to involve as many other unrelated people as you can because you enjoy creating a shitstorm out of nothing to fuel your crusade against the evil flame legion (:
---
The more you boys ask for source, the more you get shady. Why you all need an instant source? I don't trust you too. Ppl checked files on virus scanners, and they reported nothing. Let's this be our judge ok? Or you can forward some security spec that you trust to me and i'm send him source code to inspect on.
---
That’s... actually not the case strangely.  I have accounts made wel after that That never signed up for SMS or an authenticator and have been sending mats/gold from them.
---
I’m guessing that stance changed since all new accounts use email 2fa by default.
---
You have to rotate your character 3 times beforehand that’s why
---
Meh you did this in purpose. It takes any non retard to deposit materials, open the boxes you are stacking and fuck off. 
---
Romperoo about to get foo'd up.
---
I feel like you're not really responding to my arguments here. Yes, in their essence they are the same: they're the villains. But my point is that gods are more interesting villains. What you're saying here reads to me like: "They're the same because they have the same purpose in the story", but apart from having the same purpose they are extremely different beings. So..
---
&gt;How could I be wrong in what i feel? I feel that way, and I'm pretty sure about it.
---
I never said your opinion was wrong, but saying dragons and gods bring the same kind of issues to the plot is not true. You might as well stop reading a lot because most stories have protagonists and villains so on a meta level, they're all the same. 
---
I thought I'd be the last person to defend Arenanet's storytelling, but I'm glad I didn't think the story was as flat as you seem to have experienced it. 
---
The solution to this would have been to save the IP from each location upon the first log-in...and then removing them (if felt necessary) later.
---
...but some people think differently.
---
atleast we know its a pretty hard dong
---
Oh that is cool. I look forward to seeing how this develops. The game engine is getting increasingly creaky as they push it to its limits so anything that improves the lifespan of the game would be amazing. 
---
Ah, that is interesting. Thanks
---
I'm not goin to argue on this more. 
---
Wait for sources if you are concerned. If you trust that i'm a good person, or trust i'm a bad person, that is your choice. 
---
But mind your blamings, if you blame me on something, please, do it with proves. 
---
I'm not goin to run and post sources instantly, anyway.
---
There is night time, so i'm out for today. See you later!
---
delet this
---
Thank you, will give it a shot. :)
---
Nope. You can sell your items on the TP from anywhere and there’s deposit all mats and right click -&gt; salvage all.  It would take less than five minutes to clean up OP’s inventory. 
---
you didnt said second head's name
---
Too late right now to read this but I'll definetly read it. Thanks.
---
Best part is that I told you specifically what to do but you getting butt hurt over my tone is pretty amusing. Dumb shit.
---
I noticed this in the cinematic also.  Keep in mind though that at the last stage of the battle you are fighting his eye (this same right eye), and when you 'defeat' it, you see it breaks and becomes discolored.  This may just be continuity - his eye was injured.
---
Don't forget using a lesser vision crystal to unlock those design-a-weapon collections.
---
I'm sensing a pattern!
---
Great art! The name Trisha is a bit anti-climactic. 
---
The Soap Dragon?
---
Okay, PUA. 
---
If it's worth anything, the Russian part of the Readme file has a very low number of spelling errors. This looks too well-put to be *total* scam (and IIRC it's also been proven to work).
---
I have it on all accounts and I can very well tell you why some people might want to keep their alts "unsecure". Whenever you change IP for some reason (ISP router restarts or simply power cut, changing place, be away from home), you have to go through 1 code per account again ... Well no problem here, that goes with the security. But wait, there is more : the system won't allow more than a few SMS sent to a given phone number. You simply can't login after gathering daily rewards on a few accounts. You have to wait like 2 hours before you can login a few other accounts. You'll easily reach sleep time and/or reset (which is basically the same in EU) before you're done ... bye bye loot.
---
Maybe we'll get to use some of those fancy charr submarines 
---
Two possibilities:
---
1) OP is a brilliant but malicious programmer, who actually managed to write a wrapper for dx9 to dx12. He then also bundled telemetry tracking into his binaries, which them steals everybody's banking info.
---
2) OP is a brilliant but paranoid programmer, who does not want anybody to look at his code. That telemetry binary he included wasn't hidden in any way, and he really was only using it for debugging purposes.
---
Either way, it's suspicious.
---
It looks like absolute garbage on everyone, if that helps
---
Eelectricity ?
---
Do you remember the names of the tracks that played there?
---
Woah, I love it!
---
I didn’t. I am very interested on that app, but will only use it after a security check is possible. Nevertheless, I want to see how things develop, that’s why I want to know what happened to that post
---
How many Lions Arches will we destroy for that? 
---
Can you know if mods deleted it?
---
He told me he didn't delete it.
---
There are ways to attack SMS authentications.
---
2FA means : TWO FACTORS. If you lose any of those factors, you're back to one.
---
If you *know* that the password might have been compromised, there is literally NO reason not to change it. All you have to lose is a few seconds of you time. Boom, back to actual 2FA.
---
its just a risk one should not take. especially when the ban/account theft risk is so high.
---
stealing MMO accounts is big business with these black markets.
---
Its pretty bad unless you are mostly covered up.

---
i'm not that surprised given the fact that the userbase has been ragging on about performance upgrades in any way possible for ages now, for good reason.  Any glimmer of hope would immediately be jumped on before any experienced developers could pour over the source code for validity of both the method and any other items being thrown into the pipeline.  
---
Would it have been better if the source code was released?  Absolutely, especially for those like myself curious as to how the translation aspect was handled.  The developer didn't do themselves any favors either by being defensive and aggressive postured towards the end of the thread.  All in all though, a new promising PoC method was put forth to the community at large and I have no doubt there will eventually be other developers that will start developing similar libraries knowing that the method has some substance behind it.
---
Why log if it won't be sent?
---
Calm down dude it was just a example and like I said, I’m not a big lore buff so I don’t know how ‘possible’ as it would have been
---
Take a seat
---
Also curious to see the character!
---
Reddit overreacted and everyone adopted one user's words without doing any research, what else is new.
---
I had this when I installed arcDPS.
---
Once I removed it, editing was back to normal.
---
When I first saw it I was confused by the reports until I read through everything. While there is still a possibility that it was perfectly fine, those answers were very suspect. 
---
I love the idea of the tool and if it does work I would love to use it but right now better safe than sorry. OP was a brand new reddit account and just there was way to many suspicious things going on. 
---
They don’t need it for that.
---
There was no evidence, link to evidence? There was theories. Nothing changed on its trustworthiness i mean it is a 3rd party tool without source code, trust it or not up to the user.
---
There was no such evidence that it keylogs, although it can, just like most other 3rd party tools. **can** is the word.
---
Unless mod team has a new rule where no 3rd party programs are allowed to be shared unless source code is released with it, this removal is just stupid.
---
Worst part is that, people will link the git now instead of the thread and ppl won't see those comments that you call as "evidence".
---
Throw that magnetit vendor device out of your shared inventory slot and replace it with a permanent bank access. 
---
No more inventory management problems (I won't say anything about bank management).
---
the mere presence of that particular binary is a bit of a red flag.
---
if the OP wanted to collect debugging data, using that binary is unnecessary -- one does not use such a powerful binary just to write text to a file on the hard drive. after all, one of its features is the ability to send data over network.
---
until the OP shares source files, i recommend avoiding it, even if it "works".
---
You can't link to either one right now.
---
All these years telling people that merely using a newer version of DirectX won't really improve performance if the engine and assets aren't reworked to take advantage of it, and it doesn't seem to sink in. 
---
People keep thinking it's like a switch one flips to enable it.
---
I literally cant look at this ....
---
Infusion effects don't show on the character selection screen, btw.
---
Do NOT change your password UNTIL YOUR PC IS CLEAN. We don't know what was in those files. It's possible that by running GW2 with them active they infected your PC and as soon as you change your password that new password is compromised too.
---
A virus scan CAN be enough to clean your PC but it is not a guaranteed to be enough. The only way to be absolutely safe is to perform a clean install (as in nuke everything, reinstall your operating system with clean partitions) and only after that you change ALL passwords. If the files contained malware it's possible it's not only going after your GW2 account but any and all accounts you use anywhere, e.g. online banking accounts.
---
Changing the passwords on a clean PC is not enough if you ever use the infected PC again. It can be a good idea to do that until you have time to clean your PC though.
---
playing other games
---
Nope but the game contains all the req. for M rating.
---
The tool definitely works, though, even if the improvement is minor.
---
scary oO but still looks nice
---
I've been there! It's gorgeous, and the water is lovely &lt;3
---
I mean the red flag was the OP not wanting to release the code to the open. Lol. I have intern developers under me who I mentor and have their code public so they can share it even if its not the neatest. Someone would have caught it.
---
today seems the day of scary but still nice looking pics ;)
---
Right now i'm on Thunderhead meta schedules for the serpentite jewels so my usual thing is 
---
1. Work on dailies
---
2. Thunderhead meta
---
3. Thunderhead hearts and mine the map currency along the way
---
4. Try to jump onto AB because i'm working on the Auric Weapons collection because it's the last thing i need for the Auric Backplate
---
5. Second thunderhead meta
---
6. Max out on the metal farm and the map currency farm on thunderhead
---
7. Do thunderhead treasure room
---
8. Finish Dailies if they aren't done yet
---
9. Mat farm in Siren's Landing (elder wood cluster to the south) and Cursed Shore (ghost peppers, saffron, truffle, wood, metal)
---
sweet :)

---
So how do you explain how others have formed a connection then, when you haven't? Aurene is clearly a popular character. People obviously  have strong feelings about her.
---
This isn't a tv series and it's not a novel. It's a serial that paints in broad strokes. It requires you to process what you're seeing. If you're not processing it, the problem might not be the stories.
---
clearly yes, wvw and pvp might have their issues but if you play pve or even more than one gamemode you will have a lot to do and you still find enough ppl in all gamemodes. gw2 is dead is more meme than true atm, even tho anet need to do more for wvw/pvp.
---
Wow you completely destroyed all my arguments and totally convinced me that the Rune you didn't even mention is definitely better than Pack Runes. *Sarcasm off* Maybe you want to share your enlightenment about the real BiS Rune for Supp Chrono with the world?
---
&gt; This is not riskier than any other shit ppl download and use without any source code availability
---
ironically GW2 is a case of that.. i mean.. they fucking sniffed for cheattools on our pc's...
---
This asura is insane ! I love her !
---
2 days was my record. Hated guardian back then so i ate cookies while mindlessly run AC for the two days. Don't forget to sleep.
---
reddit is not the only platform where stories like this one get shared.
---
I know the feeling , I had the issue while making my legendary weapon , but found out as much I save them I need to spend them by using or selling .
---
At some point you will find a balance , the main issue would be if the player is a horder ^^ then no matter how much space they get it will always get full.

---
there's Steve the Skeleton and then there's Scuba Steve.
---
looks like a furry REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
&gt;It was such a good era of the game.
---
Going to disagree.
---
I think the individual bits were good, but the pace of delivery and the amount of content was really lacking.
---
Something to remember from back then was that ANet were really pushing the idea they would *never* do an expansion in the manner of the GW1 expansions. The first few LW parts were underwhelming, *and* we had the devs insisting that *this* was how the game was going to remain for the future.
---
It *did* improve; for instance, the invasion/retaking of Lion's Arch was one of the most fun things I've ever experienced in a multiplayer game - and *Heart of Thorns* eventually came along and proper expansion content became part of our expectations, something to always look forward to. However, for quite a long time, people were really torn about where the game was going.
---
*"You royal boob!"*
---
idk +20 fps for me was not minor
---
More than many, most likely 99% haven't experienced it. Especially after Bless and any other games that had players migrate here.

Guardian also has higher than average selfrez potential with their downstate 3, so watch for that. A lot of times warriors will selfrez till they can use vengeance (they can't cap during that so just run away, especially if the warrior uses rampage). Mesmers often do the same thing because their illusionary rogue is so OP.
---
&gt;Remake them as instances, scale down the difficulty/add in NPCs who can actually throw in some damage, and now you have people paying $10-$20 for the season.
---
Yeah, I've always thought this would be great.
---
I have to assume that (putting aside whether ANet have the staff available to do it; that's something only they can really know) that they have data which informs their decision.
---
For instance, they might believe many long-time players would object to paying for something they've already done (because although the instances would be "new", some people would definitely debate whether they should have to pay again) and they *must* have figures for how many players are joining/have joined since LW1 was over and have played through enough of the story to suggest they do it.
---
I just say this because I would happily pay 20$ for a bunch of instances that recap LWS1, a lot of us would - but ANet haven't done it despite plenty of time passing, which can only mean they have good reasons not to do it.
---
It did not. It was a combination of overriding a few safety measures that prevent crashes and placebo effect.
---
Hey there guys, I would like to know if it's possible to set explorable things like this on your sidebar, I'm playing this game now since release, but I was never able to tell how this is done, it just happens randomly sometimes and it really helpful to find some tricky stuff without any guide or struggles.
---
am i wrong? for it to recharge, an enemy must die otherwise, you apply a blindness that only blocks 1 attack and you have a lot of ads in PoF that has multiple attack skills. e.g rifle dude shoots like 4 times, the guy that charges hits multiple times who also has the skill where he calls fire from sky that also hits multiple times, the surfer hits multiple times while skidding and while running into you, even the dogs that pull, jacaranda's storm hits multiple times... you get the point.
---
i guess if you're skilled enough that you can read all the attacks are coming from where will you then be able to time your dodges and blocks since guardians are great with blocks to begin with (focus for the win) or if firebrand, time your stuns and immunity, but as a newer/lazier player this will suffice and his choice isn't necessarily wrong -- it's open world, have fun with builds. If he said something like fractals or raids, i woulda cringed a tiny bit.

the creator of the wrapper is now asking for someone to review his source code.
---
this step is unnecessary, btw. if the source is available, everybody can review it.
---
FooOooo
---
i think it is sketchy too, i think ppl have a right to be skeptical about it. I just don't think these are worth a removal unless it is going to be a general rule and there is no real evidence it is harmful as of now.

Let people decide if they want to use it.

You can easily kill 1 add/second just by using GS4/GS2.

Again, this has nothing to do with skill. You literally just run around using your weapon skills while spamming F1, sometimes multiple times per channel.

Why are you making it this hard?

Down voted because people who “farm pvp” are the ones who afk mid game and ruin it for those who play to win..

Given that the original thread isn't to be linked, I'd like to post some relevant screenshots of it:

When I first saw the post, it seemed like a weird workaround for dx12, but okay... whatever. When I realized it had a telemetry library in it, I was a bit confused as to why that was included. More than anything, it was the author's responses that made me actively not trust it. It could be completely fine and a cool trick for getting dx12, but I have no way of knowing that's all it does. Source code would fix that and I'm hopeful the author will post it.

If I had to guess it would probably be a combination of the posture, and the general softness the style has. Charr are normally more hunched and typically have a few rougher features to them, like protruding teeth.
---
Also missing the 2nd pair of horns.
---
Looks good though, like the minimalist leaning style.
---
Can this be the next mount? Looks really cool
---
It’s called opinions, I put that it was in the title, I never claimed that no body did.
---
And I even say in that the 3 month break between episodes is a big issue (which does go in part with the processing bit) but to claim that that is 100% the viewers fault is just stupid 
---
True!
---
Pretty sure that’s R18+
---
No.
---
Well, there were serious clues that we shouldn't trust or use it until we get source code, but not true "evidence" afaik.
---
Also, no matter if it was clean or actually malicious, I think it raised a real idea. If it actually worked for what it claimed it was doing (improve performance a lot), as suggested by ONE happy user in the original thread, then it may open nice things for the game. It would then prove that it's actually possible to make a dx9-dx12 adapter to get pretty good performance and technical gains without having to actually port the game to dx12 (which anet doesn't want to do afaik). Such possibility could be used at best by anet by including it in the game, or by other good 3rd party developers like we have in this community.

Very nice!

Are you being sarcastic or do you just have no idea what you are talking about?  Replacing the hardware is not necessary.  
---
Is it really an improvement?
---
Choose the objectively better option:
---
A: Stable shitty performance  
---
B: Fluctuating okay to great performance with constant crashes
---
If you'd like to ask questions about Sword Weaver in raids ( and perhaps fractals), you can feel free to ask in either Raid Training discord ( Raid Academy or Raider's in Training), and people there can answer. 
---
Marjorie doesn't have anything else defining her as a character other than being a lesbian? As someone with half a brain cell, fuck off. Referring to someone as "that lesbian" instead of using their *very well known name* is an unnecessary throwaway. Try calling Anne Frank "that Jew" and see where it gets you. 
---
It's a vicious cycle. People act like that because they think they won't be punished, or do not care about being punished. And go around telling people they won't be punished. So people end up giving up on reporting them. And that makes dealing with them take longer, so more people can act like that for longer without being punished, which makes people think they won't be punished, and things only get worse. 
---
To slow down and even revert the cycle, what we need is a better report system that is more clear and leaves no doubt about which one is the right choice so people do not give up mid-report. And we need the game to give feedback to players telling them that a report they made helped addressing negative behaviors. Not telling them who got punished, just that someone they reported got punished. 
---
One people know how to report, and know that reporting does work, the myth of going unpunished will lose power, more people will report those who deserve it, and more people will watch their behavior to avoid being punished. 
---
Of course, it has to be made clear that frivolous reporting will get punished too. We don't want to go all the way to excessive reports clogging support either. 
---
By going to PoF map and find herochallanges and make them. Will give you 10 points per challange. 
---
How ever you are not gonna dual wield sword on ele since you can only have sword in main hand and not in offhand.
---
Actually not the most of stats(by far). But it's still very nice, cuz additionaly you can swap the runes anytime. 
---
Gonna need a source on that.  
---
^(\(oh wait it's closed\))
---
The hero challenges in HoT and PoF each give 10 points per hero challenge. I recommend the latter since they can be soloed, but both have fairly regular trains through the maps that you can find by going into LFG.
---
Otherwise, you could go do the singular point challenges around Core Tyria.
---

So there is roughly 3 categories, trustworthy, unknown, harmful right. This is unknown, still is, was before. So i am trying to say that, if unknown is not allowed, it should be said so. Then people can decide if they want to share their sourcecode to be able to share it here or not.
---
Why is that such a bad thing to ask for? Same mods also said for a long while it had keylogger in it, which they had 0 way of knowing. They make mistakes, rules are good to have.
---
is this come from new update or it just a addon? 
---
Dude. You're way too invested in my account security. Back the fuck off. I know you don't mean to, but you're coming across as a massive, possessive fucking asshole right the fuck now. FYI, I changed the password when the telemetry was first discovered. But at this point, you're way more invested in my account security than you're allowed to.
---
And don't make this somehow about me encouraging other people to not act responsibly, because at no point in all of this did I address the room and encourage them to stay in the burning house.
---
Mate. Have a nice fucking day, but enough. alright? butt out! 2 posts ago!

holy... thank you very much - this function is insane and will change everything for me xD

At least the artist that unwrapped the uvs respected the texel ratio.

I just started back, last time I played hero points weren’t a thing.

Hello there.

So what do they dual wield, sword and what?

This is a competitive game mode, lacking voice comms, on the internet, with strangers. Saying “this kind of words should not be in game”  is kinda hilarious. Have you ever played another competitive game mode in any other game?

While I’m not going to say smack talk is acceptable, it’s a common thing.  Block and move on.
---
Log in, receive my daily mats in my black lion expedition mail, go to guild hall to gather all nodes, go to home instance to gather nodes and chests, proceed to go on all LW3 maps and do my dailies and farming routes for map currencies, move on to do 3 of the LW4 maps for currencies and farm routes, then move on to do dailies and recs for T4 fractals. THEN finally do whatever map meta I want on various maps for a few hours, maybe pug a raid or two. Then log off. My daily GW2 life.
---
And then i think best thing is to only allow things with source code to be shared. Don't you think this would solve all of these type of issues? And if this is not what they want, i just still find it rather stupid they'd remove a post because some ppl think some .dll could do x or y.
---
There are many examples out there, even on youtube, where ppl find weird devices out in wild and they look into it like here and it can look like malware then turns out it is totally harmless (or other way around)
---
...That said, the author was indeed sketchy :P
---
Should I watch this video?
---
Though I do stress that these kind of tools need to be open source to verify that there's nothing malicious going on, I do understand the author in his frustration that his thunder was stolen by paranoïa. Whether well meant or not, it sucks to be on the receiving end.
---
Having said that, the telemetry part isn't malicious per sé. There are very good reasons to be needing to log what part of the program causes a glitch or crash. You can't help people that are having issues with your program, or figure out what's wrong with it, if you don't know where to look in the first place.
---
Lay down the pitchforks, just kindly ask for the source code in order to verify that your accounts are safe.
---
The five intro race areas together provide 30 points collectively.
---
1)full Istan meta (gh-&gt;pala) 
---
2)Matriarch
---
3)Tarir
---
4) guild synthesizers
---
Then I progress the story a bit( I'm in hot right now) or if I'm locked due to masteries I'll do some fractals or something else( node farm or some wvw depending on the mood).
---
Hero points are just skill points that there's a limited amount of. Skill challenges were replaced with hero challenges. So once you hit 80, you only need to complete some hero challenges to unlock train elite specializations, and that's the only way.
---
Unless someone is trying to *sell* their 3rd party tool i don't see why that rule would have a bad effect in general. So yea sourcecode or gtfo would be a good rule.
---
Usually sword/dagger for the most common build.
---
You say that as if they are recording the episodes all within one week, all of it takes around as long as 2 episodes of living storyto complete the records for a season (and that’s if they don’t have any issues that stall production), they just space out the releases of episodes so that it doesn’t face this long gap between and record during that time
---
Playing WvW is an alternate way to unlock hero points, completing random hero challenges:

Testimonies of Heroics are earned pretty quickly.
---
A poster made a post sharing a tool to convert the game from DX9 to DX12, there was enough suspicion to remove it as it may have contained malicious code. If you didn't download anything there is nothing to worry about.
---
DX9 is DirectX 9. It is a graphics API that all Windows games use. Guild Wars 2 uses the oldest version. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX
---
Hero points are all throughout the game, but the expansion maps give 10 points per hero challenge whereas core Tyria it’s just a single point per challenge. 
---
Man, I wish I had your istan maps.  Mine had comms that acted like assholes for simple requests and people cussing others out for staying near the gate (aka the only place to stay when gh was starting).
---
Hopefully this behavior stops and istan will feel less stressful.
---
It takes, according to Anet, six months to make a map. The maps are part of the story. I'm not really sure what you're suggesting.
---
The meta is (used to be?) super profitable. The last patch nerfed it a bit, and I'm not sure if it's as ludicrous now.
---
i have friend which every day starts with AB meta,than orr meta,fractals,istan,pinata,raids,AB meta,wvw for few hours,some pof meta and than i usualy log off,dunno whats hes doing after that XD
---
Dagger, Focus or Warhorn (if you own HoT expac)
---
Terms of service do not supersede law though. They are regularly thrown out in court cases
---
i didnt download anything from reddit or forum so i am safe
---
thank you for quick responding
---
i really worried
---
Its a great idea, but our system and mode of production don't promote that. Its fine to wish a better world, but you shouldn't let yourself be "hurt".
---
Yup. Way too many flags. If it was open source I would of ignored the reports and kept the original up there as long as others verified it was safe. But the users answers regarding the source code and everything else was just too much. 
---
I’ve just returned to the game, gave a shout out in LA for a guild, joined the first guild i was invited to and spent the rest of the evening having a blast and feeling so very welcome.
---
I love the social aspect just as much as the story aspect of this game, and i feel like whilst there is lots of bitching about how anet handle certain sutuations, that there really isn’t another game quite like it! 
---
You do know the thread gets linked with you posting the username of someone who commented on the thread right. Was quite easy to click name view their  profile to see the threads they have commented on.

Oh ok you're a toxic child

Keep thinking whatever crap you're thinking with your brain.

Wait, what is this infusion?? Looks like a texture glitch :o

I don't care about your account tbh. I'm just debunking the crap you're saying.

At this point and after this insane insulting/mega-raging epidermic post, I'd even be happy if something happens.
---
Really, don't worry about me caring too much.
---
Also, you have no say in what I am "allowed" to say here.
---
Toy-Shell Infusion.  was the new infusion for christmas but every hated it so its like 100g.

That's what I assumed too. Thank you.

15k ap cap on what? i assume its achievement points but i thought they were borderline infinite 
---
Isn't Braham half Norn too?

It's all good :) Just gotta keep the subreddit tidy. It's been reposted a loooooot today, you're not alone :)

Take a look!

At some point I just gave up and made an empty chat tab just for PvP. Seriously, my sanity is worth more than an ephemeral strategic advantage in something that I just can't care about any longer.
---
"Everyone else is doing it so who cares"
---
What a defeatist attidute. This is part of the problem, making toxicity of PvP norm. It's why it has grown into norm over the years. It didn't use to be *this* vile. The change for better comes from all of us. If we just shrug it and do nothing, it will never change for better.
---
You were gradually getting better at it.
---
No. It has been stated reproduction between different races is not possible so a half Norn is not a thing in world.  
---
Thanks mods!
---
 As a dev, there's literally no reason I can think of not to release the source code. The *only* legitimate reason to not release the source code no a project is if you plan to make money off of it, and considering this is (apparently) so heavily leveraging ANet's stuff... Yeh, no.
---
Probably. We sort of saw some eldritch style beings in the Shattered Observatory fractal, as well as the "Voice" in the Deepstone fractal which could be assumed to not be from this world. Hard to say tho because we know so little about what the mists actually are.
---
&gt;CHANGE YOUR PASSWORD and run a malware/virus/everything scan on your PC just to be safe.

Yeah, you may clean your PC *first*, and *then* change your password.

What's this armor skin?

We should have a policy about no posting/advertising addons or utilities without disclosing the source code upfront.

Norns are irrelevant.

Why am I looking at Drax and John Cena?
---
I prefer pof as well.
---
Other people argued he "had a third of his face missing". Perhaps the severity of the damage is a subjective matter.

Might as well get a love interest for Brahm since he got cucked in season 1.

is there a `P7logs` directory in your gw2 folder?
