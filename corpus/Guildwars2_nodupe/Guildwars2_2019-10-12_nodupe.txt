...and you missed the joke

---
The way I look at it, new dyes only come out once per year in august.
---
Ooooooh nice.
---

---
I am both pleased for you and jealous of you. It's a weird combo 😆
---
Nah, a new player that wants to do story wants to do the full story lol, not 40% of it
---
More variety but 1 obvious choice to go with, how more GW2 can it be, it sounds like the trait system
---
That's actually funny
---
biggest; chunkiest male ~~charr~~ Norn. being able to see yourself is useful :p
---
Racials really don't matter much; but flavour wise a [Snow Leopard](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Become_the_Snow_Leopard) Attuned Norn is pretty sweet; also get some stealth out of it too :)
---
Anet had been good at making sure the first 3 2nd leggo weapon covers until HoT specs. Now for the PoF elites, the newer 2nd gen covers but the 1st lacks flavor on them.
---
To answer your question, reaper shroud 4 and sunrise doesn't work (unfortunately) and quip not stacking with photon pistol barrage
---
Pretty spot on.
---
I feel the need to tell you that you sound like a dick.
---
you respond to the old ticket, you don't make a new ticket. A new ticket puts you at the end of the line again.
---
Unless you force opponents to use default skins.
---
I have responded to each of the 3 tickets, multiple time. I think the first time had 3 bumps on my part.
---
When did you ininiate the dispute?
---
Given the cost of development, I'd rather just use the "easiest" way and use the TP to sell my old bags and buy the ones I need. Much rather have that development time spent on bug fixes and improving templates.
---
I love the idea but I agree the clone should be a limited duration.
---
Sylvari.
---
I went with Asura for my thief and now have a tiny, deadly Yoda-ish type daredevil.  Complete with the absurd flipping.
---
Whoo, chile. It's all fun and games till the retal doesn't get stripped.
---
Yes. 
---
Snowcrows.com for raid builds.

Funerary and Foefire armor, Caudecus mask, Ambrite weapons. The whole look is built around Ambrite weapons - charr are so big the most beautiful weapons look even MORE beautiful on them.
---
The "destroy" button.  It's as worthless now as it was 3 years ago.
---
You'll need some to craft Ascended gear, but you should never need so much that you need to stack extra in your bank.  It's easy to get more.
---
No, you won't lose anything.
---
By levelling to 80, you earn exactly enough Hero Points to unlock everything from your base class.  This is what you saw on your Guardian.  If you use the boost on a character that's already earned, say, 20 Hero Points from exploring the world, then your end result after unlocking everything from your base class is a level 80 character with 20 extra Hero Points left over.
---
&gt;  it's on a MASSIVE stock-effecting scale
---
is it tho?
---
yeah, you bump it back at the end of the whole queue with that, as moth said.  
---
as long as no one from the support has it in progress, all you do is put your ticket back at the end of the queue as if its a new one since you added new things onto it.

Thread removed: Stirring up drama or violating the CoC is not allowed.

See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Occultist necromancer spec:  
---
**Weapons**: dual pistols, specializing in ranged power-based damage output.   
---
**Life force**: life force for Occultist will be a cursed ammunition bar that has up to 6 fixed marks on the bar representing ammo.   
---
**Death shroud**: Engaging occultist shroud would provide massive defensive buffs for a relatively short duration (protection, aegis, vigor, stability) on use as well as a moderately large barrier, but not grant an extra health bar. Life force is not drained with incoming damage. The abilities would be moderately powerful and work on the ammo system using your accumulated ammo pool without individual cooldowns. Once you have exhausted the last "full" round of cursed ammo you have, you are forced to leave death shroud.   
---
**Death shroud abilities**: "cursed" skills leave a mark on your initial target, causing the effect to apply in an area around them. The difference in effects would be similar to how Reaper shroud mimics the types of effects of baseline death shroud abilities.   
---
**Death shroud visuals**: a gaunt, lean grim reaper in a trenchcoat and a wide-brimmed hat, wielding a unique revolver rifle model.  
---
**New utility type**: glyph. Occultist glyphs are inscribed on the victim and apply un-dodgeable effects around them after a delay (dodge is checked once on skill application).
---
maybe, but I have been doing strike mission everyday from the patch. Everyday lots of people say they are having fun doing them when I ask them about it. Maybe the most important thing in video games is the fun aspect?
---
"fun" is subjective, if you wanna call something good or bad content you can't just say "i don't like it therefore it's bad"
---
i do the strike mission and fractals every day, *some* fractals can feel like a chore for me, depending on the instabilies (i do CMs t4s and recs every day), but the strike mission always feels like a chore. the only reason i do the strike is for the 300 volatile magic
---
Well "fun" is subjective so it's different for everybody. Obviously having fun is the main reason for playing vidya games.
---
well every opinion is subjective. That means every post on reddit is subjective as well. I like strike mission and I have a feeling more people like tham judging by what people were typing in chat everyday on my strike missions. I have made this post so people can agree or disagree. And anet can see that and take notes.
---
&gt;all I do is masturbate and play video games.
---
thats right. And as we know usually people are more likely to talk about negative experience. So strike missions judging by reddit posts could be considered a failure. Wanted to make this post to  show there are some people who actually really enjoy them.
---
no you can evaluate content on an objective level and the strike has next to nothing to actually evaluate.
---
i'm ok with them making the first one easy but this is just braindead. people were soloing it the first day it came out.
---
if they want to make it *that* "accessible" for casual or new players they should have at least gave it a hard mode with more health, mechanics, breakbar, etc. with better rewards for more dedicated players or incentive for the casuals/new players to get better.
---
Honestly never been spawncamped before in wvw.  Whenever I see people sitting outside our spawn I used one of the other TWO EXITS.
---
It's virtual currency that is useful for absolutely nothing else but in-game purchases. What you purchase in-game is not going to affect anything outside of it, and therefore, does not matter what you do with it. If it makes you happy, then that's what counts.
---
How many times are you going to post that poll? People obviously don't want this stuff forced in their game.
---
That was 6 years ago. 
---
The updates now are not planned to be biweekly.
---
The updates then were successfully biweekly (although yes they failed on many other fronts).
---
You're comparing apples to oranges, and that title seems practically inflammatory and intentionally clickbaity to me.
---
Look, god knows, I'm worried as hell about the future of this game. That said, the rate of updates aren't the issue. It's the lack of communication and lack of difficult content for veteran players that really worry me. If anything LWS3 and LWS4 proved that ArenaNet is 1000% capable of handling a constant flow of casual content.
---
Human female, obviously
---
Also a *lot* of temporary stuff.
---
I did the maths for another post, it's $70 without any temporary discounts. Going with [DLGamer's](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807) $20 expansions and anniversary sale discounts for LWS, it's $50 ($45.4 and 368 leftover gems). With current rates LWS bundles total 1,461.79 (1,170.69) gold.
---
My recommendation (on top of your excellent advice) would be to skip LWS2 at first, and buy LWS3 episode by episode with gold. It's after all only around 73 gold per episode, and they'll be spending a good amount of time in HoT maps grinding mastery XP, earning decent gold as well. They may even hit the required 351 gold to get the whole season as a bundle.
---
I'm not comparing anything what is up with your sudden defensive behaviour lol.
---
If you're attempting to min max and are taking racials into account, you already failed.
---
Clearly sylvari. They photosynthesize, so they don't require breathing. Makes for an accurate sniper ;) Not like you'd play any other races anyway, sylvari are clearly the master race.
---
Pretty much all major unlocks are now account-wide (dyes, skins, masteries, mounts). I'd recommend doing the first mission in each of HoT and PoF so you can unlock your glider and your raptor, respectively. This will give you some welcome mobility
---
How do you know they are not escaped crickets from Area 51 in human suits?
---
You missing lightsaber and prime light beam.
---
Hmm maybe, I play mesmer and thief mostly so I guess it's more fast paced for me. Try free cam it helps.
---
Agree! i want this mini/backpack
---
First of all, if  you think the manifesto backfired on them, I don't know what to tell you. It was a mega successful marketing tool that did more to sell the game than anything else pre launch. Every marking plan should backfire they way the manifesto did.
---
The very definiition of a manifesto in the first place is a statement of intent, not a guarantee of delievery. The manifesto was produced 2 years after the game launched. There as also an immediate clarification about it just after that explained some things since the way it was edited felt confusing.  Colin was talking about dyamic events and Ree was talking about the personal story.
---
I shut down reading this article, though I didn't downvote it once i saw the words the manifesto backfired. The manifesto has a pretty strong hand in making the success of this game what it is.
---
Ozzy's just trolling you.
---
I went with Asura, the red laser effects from the Deadeye rifle is extremely high tech looking, and perfect for Asura-themed Rifle skins.
---
Thieves are also a fitting class for Asura because within-lore the Asura are known to steal research and inventions from one another.
---
ah strike missions.. i forgot about that bad joke that anet delivered here.. even diablo immortal doesnt sound that disappointing compared to them
---
Off the top of my head; enlarge party/squad health bars, remove all names except NPCs, adjust your FoV, lower graphical settings (**turn off post processing**), and turn off motion blur.
---
So I want to start GW2, is it region locked? I will be playing from SEA.
---
Which server would be best for me?
---
Mine didn’t but he’s still in the box.
---
Sorry, but you are naively overestimating this “boycott”. It’s no massive in any sense and won’t ever register of Blizzard’s radar.
---
Reddit is like 1% of the player base and just a vocal minority who absolutely in no way represent the entire player base ; it won’t even register on Blizzard’s radar.
---
And let’s be honest, it’s just memes and slacktivism for Karma and they’ll return 1 week later when inevitably there’s something new to aim pitchforks at. They like to play revolutionary but only from the safety of their computer chairs. 
---
That’s how outrage culture works
---
How to prevent the exploding bombs that one shot you if on full glass ele?
---
Maybe it’s a test for guildwars mobile?
---
But honestly, the loot is so bad, people skip the chests, stack to kill the boss and pay for teleporting out abecause of the stupid 2 min wait time at the end.
---
I'm sorry for all the salty downvotes, OP. I like the missions as well
---
I read "Norn racials are useless" and I member the video of some dude hitting 50k DPS oneshots in bear form.... Hmmmmmmmmmmmmm....
---
Thank you!
---
Ps: I hate the "you need to be ranged to DPS me" mechanic. F\*ck this, sincerly: every pure melee class.
---
Bounties could've been so good without the RNG.
---
Pay for teleporting out, what? There is the button to leave the instance on top of your map.
---
It'd anger the furries, won't happen
---
I always do public. Maybe there is a difference. I will see later. :)
---
if you put it that way it sounds like I should just stick with my daily treasure mushroom kill XD
---
I can definitely see *why* ArenaNet has chosen this tactic. It's not that they have no reasons or merit for doing so, they definitely have some valid motivations behind it. I just don't think it's the right idea, or the best for the game's health.
---
I think in terms of *player expectations and customer relations* the manifesto absolutely backfired. Most of it is not true, or, if it is true, is true in the technical sense, or in that they did something different that happened to meet the same goal. But none of that matters so much to the point of this as the fact that the community hates it and constantly throw it back in ANet's face, as many people have pointed out in the comments. Was it a successful "Hype" tactic? Certainly.
---
Yes I have, but as you might have seen, I never mentioned pay 2 win items in my post, so it is irrelevant.
---
Fashion wars is not a expression that I came up with, but rather from all the people where collecting skins IS the endgame. Just because you don't see it that way does not mean you can totally dismiss that point.
---
It's mostly happening on Hearthstone reddit, WoWers don't even know about the situation.
---
Is that bragging or?
---
Command tag. Mark object/person. (Hide/turn off com tag if you don’t want others to join your squad/team)
---
We mark people and run “tagless” in WvW all the time with just a marker (only people in your own team can see it).
---
In pve a lot of meta event squad leaders will “mark” objectives like... stand here (at the big purple circle) and wait for XYZ to pop up and kill them and move to the next marker. 
---
Just Search the wiki for command tag.
---
So just team up and put a marker out and play with a big green arrow over your head, or a purple circle, or there are all sorts of them so good luck, have fun and please enjoy the game and community!
---
Does watching the Season 1 Story will spoil Personal Story for me? Technically it only happens after Personal Story - but I did some leveling in Kessex Hills and the zone is a mess. Scouts are not streamlined, you can't get into the Fort, people keep speaking about the destroyed tower etc etc. So I'm assuming Season 1 story happened in Kessex, and that's the zone is already "changed" around what happened. I'm thinking about watching Season 1 just so I can be more connected to what the NPC are talking about and the general story of the zone.
---
Chat are 3 options for chat text size. small medium and large. You can access it by clicking the little cog at the top right of the chatbox. All ui boxes can be enlarged by click and drag. Also if you google gw2 shaders you find ways to alter the colors of things in game. useful if you have some form of color blindness. These are perfectly safe to use and there are tutorials on youtube for how to.
---
ah yes SC totally never wrote class guides
---
"but but... BLiZzZarD" - that guy probably
---
&gt;Well he did destroy property
---
welcome to germany "das internet ist für uns alle neuland" destroying someones whole inventory in a mmorpg is not considered property cause there is no real laws around the internet
---
Don't Have a question. Came to THANK YOU all, cause without the wiki, there is a 60%+ chance I would not be playing GW2 any more. 
---
Please keep it up!
---
also, the last time they tried to regulate the internet, 14yr old brats collectively lost their mind and hardraged
---
Well, it's a sense of accomplishment for me - seeing your hard work used by readers, and it's fun to fill out blank pages with information. I guess it appeals to the "DOCUMENT ALL THINGS" person inside me. 😌
---
&gt;Or do your feefees say he broke the law?
---
didnt you know the first rule of reddit ? feels over reals
---
Does it come with the game? Do you get the base game when you register it, or are you automatically upgraded to both expansions?
---
Asura with a Charrzooka ;)
---
also do Asuras need to kneel? They're already too close to the ground
---
dude.. he got access to all of those accounts. There is no "thinks it would" it HAPPENED
---
Actually they are not. Lots of ppl do them every day at every hours and I dropped 3 shoulders which let me earn more or less 400 gold. So it is a wonderful content since as he said the time u spend doing can grant u a reward. Not like the 4 keys vault chest .
---
Hey guys, doc ref here. Good luck in the AMA!
---
To me, it's a fun, productive and meaningful hobby -- I've always struggled with feeling guilty about "wasting" my life and editing helped easing this kind of guilt. Aside from that, I joined the wiki back in 2015 because I wanted to make friends and belong somewhere, so I'm very happy and proud to be a part of this awesome and incredibly talented community.
---
&gt; look at how Bungie handles communicating to their playerbase with Destiny 2.
---
dont need to look into another genre. When even the archeage publisher/devs outcommunicate you, you got a big problem. Anet is a joke in the industry
---
That is the whole point. A dps golem for them go get data or avarage dps of ppl.
---
yupyup, best thing to do is bind dismount, so if you really don't need to pounce then don't...at least till they fix it maybe?
---
It's a hobby, of sorts, that I mostly do after work, or while playing; reading through recent changes, checking the edits, it all comes sort of naturally to me while being in the game.
---
It does take some time out of your day (although it's became a routine thing for me to do), so sometimes you can't really effort to check *all* the things, unfortunately.
---
Dont really have any questions but wanted to thank you for you hard work!
---
&gt;(2) Finishing off area articles, there are so many areas in the game and getting every gathering node, foe, ally, bit of dialogue takes a while  
---
  
---
cough cough *Icevine Dale rams* cough cough
---
Dedication relies on new ingame content for me... content droughts are tricky, there's always stuff to modify/add if you look hard enough. There's a button 5 links down on every page to "Random page" -- [Special:Random](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special:Random) -- its amazing how few clicks it needs to find an article with something to improve.
---
It might be weird but I almost get more enjoyment out of adding something new to the wiki (e.g. a walkthrough) as encountering it ingame.
---
Definitely NPC-related information such as locations they can be found, dialogue, combat abilities, and stolen skills. In fact, the wiki category [NPC articles with stub sections](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Category:NPC_articles_with_stub_sections) currently has 3661 NPC articles that are missing information.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Icevine_Dale#Trivia wtf? :D
---
I’m not sure as these were all put together for the base game. It comes with a few in game items though.
---
First of all, a bigs thanks to everybody editing the wiki.
---
Some feedback/questions:
---
Are there video guides available on how to edit the wiki?
---
When big content patches go live, it usually takes a couple of days to get the majority of the info online, which is quite normal and not meant as criticism.
---
But maybe its a good idea to make a wiki-meta thread hereo n reddit or the foruns with every new content patch, where players can just dump info for  you guys to edit in.
---
Well, it seems like your really into the game lore. If you suggested finishing the Personal Story before checking the Recap/Video for season 1 - I can live with the NPC speaking about events I don't know :-)
---
[Those things were such a pain to find for a second time and record](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Talk:Icevine_Dale)
---
Personally, I’ve heard of the quality of Dulfy, but never had to rely on her guides due to the quality of the Official Wiki (so thank you, for all you do for it)!
---
How do you feel about fan sites? Has Dulfy provided any edits to the wiki, or has the wiki ever offered (or been offered) to collaborate with her?
---
it's an issue anet introduced when they attempted to fix the abuse of pounce (pounce -&gt; out of combat -&gt; mount -&gt; pounce). their official solution was to put a CD on mounting back up itself, but i would guess the CD on the engage skill was one of the potential solutions that slipped into the live-client.
---
what happens is that if you are mid-air (or the game thinks you are) the skill entirely fails yet still goes on full CD, which then leads to a pretty jarring and inconsistent experience in the field.
---
frankly i would have expected anet to fix this at the latest with the introduction of the lance skill, alas they haven't, and to me that is just yet another sign of how irrelevant wvw is to the decision makers, and how much of a rushed project the warclaw has always been.
---
its not about the article, more about bree and MOP.
---
https://imgur.com/a/nwZxiLM
---
I guess it's not too surprising that most of the sysops moved on elsewhere in the 12 years since GW1W was started.
---
The b'crats went through their election campaigns on the GW1W and eventually ended up with JonTheMon, Tanetris and Poke - Jon hasn't been around for ages, but we do see glimpses of Poke on the wiki discord, and Tanetris is still about.
---
For some reason or other we never ended up with as many sysops on the GW2W. I've been a sysop since 2013-ish.
---
chat codes are only for trait templates not equipment templates. so not any good.
---
I think far more people loved and accepted the manifesto as what it was, than every complained about it by percentage. You're always going to have your lawyers in every gaming population. Complaints about something doesn't meant that it's backfired. 
---
I absolutetly believe you're juding the general reaction to the manifesto wrong.
---
Favourite images on the wiki are either [File:User Ventriloquist turtle.jpg](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:User_Ventriloquist_turtle.jpg) or [the Cowboy Cactus revenant icon when we were creating icons with HoT release](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Chieftain_Alex/tango_icons#Options%20for%20discussion)

I occasionally find that I'm searching for small tips on achievements but there aren't any because my search only leads to the mega-table of all achievements for the episode and a particular achie doesn't have its own page, and probably for good since it's so minor. Would it be a good idea to maybe have a field for completion tips right there in the table, and for non-editors to just drop this info into the Feedback section?
---
(As a side note - text info is great, but all those small scripts and dynamic tables linked to the API are absolutely fantastic, thank you!)
---
There are two main avenues, imo:
---
# The [On Wiki of Gold project](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Projects/On_Wiki_of_Gold), wherein two articles in need of love are brought to editors' attention every other day or so. Improving one of these articles will net you some gold and gems are a reward!
---
# Check out our maintenance categories, which catalogue all articles and files in need of attention. Good ones to start with are: [Images that need updating](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Category:Image_update_requests), [Articles with stub sections](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Category:Articles_with_stub_sections), and [Articles that haven't been created yet but probably should be (warning, this one loads slowly)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special:WantedPages).

This would be a good design to DIY with some freezer paper and fabric paint, or bleach. /r/bleachshirts/
---
as an arc use i can tell you it's prolly around 4-6k and that's with me on my fractal hb build so they have 25 might fury and quickness lmao.
---
I finally logged back into my account...
---
Three characters (which I have not even played recently) were renamed with random trash and quite offensive names.
---
I submitted a formal ticket about this and requested for it to be reversed.
---
I will take it further if I don't get anywhere, but considering reddit action here over the last while where anything remotely shedding a bad image on the game being wiped, it is a bit difficult to take on the fight in public.
---
are you using any addons
---
I just wanted to say thanks! I'd've given up on 1 let alone 2 without all your hard work over the years!
---
Dulfy claims to produce the vast majority of her sites’ guides, that proofreading is her only struggle with them.
---
You think that she is assisted by dataminers or playtesters? I suppose she is known for her speed in producing guides very shortly after releases...
---
How much time a day or week do y'all spend playing the game for fun compared to researching for the wiki?
---
Although the first strike encounter is on the lower end of the difficulty spectrum and duration, I agree with this. I really think it's a great thing and step in the right direction. If they expand on this system and maybe bring some more dungeon/boss mechanics into it rather than just a pretty boring JP followed by a 1111'able boss, I could see myself enjoying it even more. I already do the first strike daily, so more of that would be a good extra method of burning some ingame time and hoping for nice rewards (got lucky twice with the shoulders and it felt pretty good ngl). I hope they'll release at least one new strike with every release, hopefully with different levels of difficulty.
---
Also ... it's a great opportunity to introduce us story nerds to more lore.
---
Likewise!  The wiki has saved me more than a few times when I've been stuck or couldn't remember how to do something.
---
Maybe 60%/40% editing the wiki versus playing the game? I got into WvW recently but I might easily spend over an hour a day tinkering.
---
Big Spender is the only WvW daily I ever do, it's easy via guild halls Badge of Tribute :)
---
&gt; matchmaking system

Wait what? We have lfr now?
---
I believe the most visited page is the [Event timers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers) page.
---
Trivia: For years after I modified it to refresh the world boss row, the wiki suffered from instabilities on the hour every hour. Eventually we realised my shit coding was causing the wiki users to DDOS the servers. [Server requests spike graph](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User_talk:Chieftain_Alex/Archive_16#...Were_you_the_villain_all_along.3F)
---
First off: thx you are great
---
Second off: Do you also work on other language Wikis? 
---
Because I live in Europe and speak German. But I most often use the English wiki because the German one lacks information (shows probably how good you do your job on the English wiki). 
---
Is there someone on your team that works on Wikis like: German Wikis, French Wikis, Spanish Wikis etc?
---
Asura because they're smallbois/girls
---
Anti toxin was a HUGE boost to their condi cleanse and the main reason why conditions haven't been great for a while now in wvw. Without it they do still have a good amount of cleanse, certainly more than most classes, but if you aren't smart with your cleanses you can get overwhelmed pretty easily now. Not many used anti corrosion plating before the patch since it wasn't needed in any situation with anti toxin and it also doesn't quite reach the insane amount of condi clear anti toxin provided even in a perfect scenario, it'll probably be a situational thing now since Medical dispersion field is still such a good trait comparatively.
---
You should try pugging a T3 Mai Trng then.  Most of the time the elite adds don't die at all
---
&gt; "fun" is subjective
---
It's ironic that this argument is only used when people disagree with someone. What a joke.
---
Same, still waiting Dulfy to post a guide... so I can finally understand what truly is happening at W7, not just playing DPS rotation at boss and blindly following other players, though so far it has worked fine.
---
Thanks. I played another game with normal 5 vs 5 and the decay is now gone and seemed to work.
---
To modify a wiki achievement table to link to a dedicated guide page, you can do something like this edit: [link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Prologue%3A_Bound_by_Blood_%28achievements%29&amp;type=revision&amp;diff=1953829&amp;oldid=1953106).
---
Adding the "| page = " line adds the link.
---
```
---
{{Achievement table row
---
| name = Additional Secrets of the Khan-Ur
---
| page = Chest of the Khan-Ur
---
| description = Open a long-hidden vault and loot what's inside.
---
}}
---
By doing that, Ventriloquist has created a link to the [Chest of the Khan-Ur](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_the_Khan-Ur) page. From there you can add any content you like to the linked page.
---
Might be a bit indiscrete, but have you guys ever met IRL ? :o
---
&gt; we add a tip to the Notes section underneath the big table.
---
It's understandable why this would work that way but it's not the most convenient place for them since it's so easy to overlook their existence. Do you think it would be feasible to have in the table itself a scrollto link/icon for achies that have those note tips, or that's too non-automatable?
---
Otherwise, it seems like dumping minor achie tips to the feedback for their main page would be the correct thing to do for now. Thanks!
---
As a friend of Wiki’s discord, I love watching you guys figure out how to display the information, working together. Patch day Chaos channel is particularly fun to peep at, like watch little bee’s buzzing around a new flower. Keep up the good work team. Lily the Shiny

Public awareness of your inability to manage your financial life? There are no "malicious practices" here, just somebody who failed to properly use the dispute/claim process.
---
A PayPal *dispute* is limited to 20 days from the day you file it and provides an opportunity for the two parties to resolve the problem between themselves. If that's not working, you elevate it to a *claim*. If the seller doesn't respond to the claim within 10 days, you get an automatic 100% refund. 
---
Since you're claiming that there's been no response from Arenanet or from the online seller, that means 20 days plus 10 days *at the very most* and the process is done. So, "3 months in and I still haven’t gotten my money back" means you screwed up. You are 100% to blame for the fact that it's taken "3 months".
---
No. Reward equals content ppl would keep on doing. So it is successful content .
---
Wikis are strange beasts, simultaneously bureaucratic and anarchic, and I think we do a pretty good job of treading the line between maintaining a consistent standard vs not worrying too much about doing everything exactly by the book or clinging to outdated practices.
---
Ultimately, however, my guess is that it comes down to the Guild Wars community in general being abnormally friendly and driven to help each other! The wiki sub-community is certainly very friendly, and we try to do what we can to ensure our editors, no matter how long they've been with us, feel welcome and supported. :)
---
Some of us have known each other for a long time. I think the NA contingent of the wiki editors have met, u/FelixOmni probably has a  better answer when he's awake later.
---
This is without doubt for me the best dedicated wiki for a game I've ever seen, for the past 6 or so years that I've used it, it has always been not just a good resource, but the best companion for exploring Tyria. I always play with the wiki open, and I thank you all for the hard work and dedication that has made this experience more enjoyable for me and my friends.  
---
Do you have any resources or guides available for starting editing? I would love to contribute translating for the spanish section on my free time.
---
Try kitless holo. It is same as SC build (sword/pistol), but with holo wall instead of grenade kit. Use holo wall toolbelt skill same time with surprise shot (same cooldown). Do not overheat.
---
DPS is fine in raid encounters, not probably top but still decent. Holo also has good amount of CC. Fun to play!
---
I think at some point she had access to the test server like some press/fan sites, but lost that privilege.
---
u/Doodleplex has contributed loads to the spanish wiki.
---
Personally I don't contribute to the other language wiki's, though we have been known to share resources. Examples: (1) locator maps you see on zone articles (red blocks) have been exported from EN to DE for use, (2) the occasional widget [this one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World#Currently_linked_worlds) is from the french wiki, (3) CSS themes from the french wiki like the [this one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Skin_footer_%28Wintersday%29.png)
---
I agree, they are pretty easy to miss, thank you for the feedback! I'll bring this up on the wiki discord (did you know we have a discord? Everyone is welcome: https://discord.gg/C4RMwPN) and see if we can figure something out!
---
Probably because it's already known, tons of maps of this, etc
---
Nah if you love it then gold well spent! Im a collector and I usually unlock anything I don't have, got really lucky the day it was released and got it, but I sold it to fund a legendary, now I cant wait to buy it again... looks great!
---
I find that channel really tempting when I haven't finished playing through the latest patch!
---
Seems like a good opportunity to promote the link to the Wiki Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/guildwars2
---
I personally adore the multitude of widgets and the event timer we have -- our tech wizards are spoiling us truly!
---
I'm saying what item he has to buy so he doesn't buy both.

For guides to the basic nuts n' bolts of editing, see [Help:Editing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Help:Editing) and [Help:Tables](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Help:Tables).
---
For a guide to our current standards, see the [General formatting guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:General_formatting). (Note that this guide only applies to the English version of the wiki; the other wikis have their own approaches which I'm not familiar with.)
---
Yeah I think making the maps work for mobile devices is probably insanely difficult. I'd skip those out of any mobile app tbh. I managed to trap myself in a map on my mobile the other day... couldn't zoom out ;)
---
As it should
---
I like to see things optimised, so whenever I come across stuff that's missing or doesn't look quite right, I try to improve it.
---
Yeah I've never gotten around to really looking into the bones of how it all works now compared to GW1 wiki days. And when I got the time previously, I was like...oh! They overhauled everything! I'll come back later lol. 
---
There is a side project I recently restarted for information that isn't easily found yet. I'm also using it as an opportunity to learn some programming so it may take a little while, but it should be very useful.
---
I understand how videos can help and how they are apreciated (sometimes I use YouTube) but PLEASE, keep stuff written!
---
Add videos or link to videos is fine. Just don't replace written material with it!
---
I'm sure the Spanish wiki would love to have more people over to help! I suggest getting in touch with u/Doodleplex, one of the admins of the Spanish wiki, to see where you might be able to help out! Other than that, this [future welcome bot message](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Incarnazeus/Pandora%27s_Box) contains a bunch of links to useful pages on the wiki.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Help:An_introduction_to_editing
---
Hmm our basic guide to editing a page is pretty ropey. Needs some improvement, add it to the to-do list!
---
It's never too late to get involved. I'm sure we could easily find a bunch of tasks for you to work on!
---
Thanks from your dedication and  amazing work.
---
For anyone who has also participated in or contributed to the GW1 wiki, do you feel the GW2 wiki is better or worse and why?
---
I don't think this is a question we can really answer as a team, since we're almost entirely independent from ArenaNet, so there's as wide a variety of opinions about ANet amongst us as there is amongst the playerbase in general.
---
Heh.. I promise i'm not quite as bad as I used to be :p
---
Dude thank you for your work. I have made so much thing because of your work
---
I'll see about making a _grand return_ one day, i'm sure :)
---
Btw, the game sometimes bugs out, and turns #1 AA on even if you did not set it, and it doesn't show on the icon. Just ctrl+right click mouse on #1, there is some kind of trigger that sets the auto attack when pouncing so it will either not trigger, or continously go on cooldown.
---
I've got a couple of questions for the krewe, too. 
---
During your time on the wiki, what has been the most memorable thing you've worked on? 
---
What are you particularly proud of creating and/or contributing to?
---
 What was the most fun thing to document?
---
We'll be waiting!
---
It is a constant issue , and no , it isn't being addressed.
---
Thanks so much for all the work you guys have put into the wiki. Something I’ve always wondered is how do you get all of the recipes for the mystic forge? When I look recipes up on the wiki, I often find myself wondering how I ever would have figured it out unless it was already on the wiki. Cooking recipes too, for that matter.
---
What are some everyday things I should be doing to efficiently gain some easy gold, besides daily achievements? I've just recently come back from a long break and started crafting my time gated pieces for ascended gear, not sure what else I should be doing every day while playing.
---
If you're going to pvp then use asura for the size.
---
The majority of my edits are somewhat minor -- fixing typos, adding or removing stub tags, that sort of thing. The sort of stuff that's easy to quickly fix as you spot it without having to devote much time. When I'm feeling up to it, I allow myself to get drawn in to articles that need more work and make a frenzied burst of major improvements until I burn out and return to maintenance mode for a while. :p
---
I always find myself returning to the wiki as an editor. I use it heavily as a player, so it's almost impossible to avoid coming across something and thinking "I could help make this better."
---
Looking at is working on. If 5 people a spending every day designing a system it still working on it. Most of time is spent in pre-production. Where you simply try to figure out how best to implement an idea or concept. Figuring out what to include and what to leave behind.
---
Once you start programming and implementing the solution, that feature might have had people working on it for months or years.
---
There's still plenty of those , too. I see them all the time.
---
I myself have terrible vision. What I've found works best is using the largest ui scaling in the graphics settings, and also make sure your chat settings are set to max size. You can find that in the little gear sign on the chat overlay.  ( Chat is the hardest thing for me to see at default).
---
Other than that not too much you can do in game accept for lower the resolution. Everyone low vision is different but I will also suggest a monitor larger than 24 inches and One with an IPS panel. I have a 27 inch IPS panel. IPS panels are good for getting close to your monitor as it  has a larger viewing angle than regular tn panels. If you try to  zoom in on something by moving your head on a tn panel it fades away pretty bad. 
---
I hope this helps. Cheers.
---
I think the copy all boons is bit too much, and its a slap in the face to Chronos.
---
That being said, something like Heat Sync that shares Quickness (and maybe one other boon like Might or Fury) can work.
---
This is so cute. Also, anyone who buys this at the very least has a sense of humor.
---
:P
---
Drood Perfect
---
No, ANet don't give a damn. You can use report function in game, to forward your report fast, efficient and directly to ANet's /dev/null
---
Flotrol and 2 drops of silicon in the black paint
---
This is only the first stepping stone: episode one will add a more challenging version of the fight, so I think the idea was for the entry-level encounter to be easy enough that no-one was put off by it. Then when the harder version arrives people feel familiar with it and are more likely to try it out.
---
No.
---
Oh, right.
---
All those backs that you get from story and leveling and that drop in dungeons and fractals should also get their own skins.
---
They do not have to be extremely detailed, they could be made out of bits of existing models and decoration assets.    
---
For example, Ghostly Spineguard could look look like a bit from an ascalonian ghost armor, bluish and translucent, leaving a blue ghostly trail as you walk.  
---
Arbor's Embrace could look like a piece of aloe vera-lloking plant tied to your back.   
---
And the Prototype sheath could just be a bit from a golem carcass strapped on your back. 
---
Since many of those with unique icons are account bound and can't be in the trading post, if they were made rare but tradable, it could relive interest for dungeons.
---
but isn't it I need to do story instances for unlocking some tracks?

Also since I know I saw it asked before somewhere, it's not a human ranger in all of the pictures. It's a variety between warriors, rangers, and elementalists. Occasionally male thief for legendary footsteps(and occasionally pistols if there's no clipping issues since that's just a hand) too so it's actually not all female.
---
Thank you! gonna check that out
---
I am new to the game, hit level 80 and finished the personal story today. Can‘t wait to get better and explore more of the world but where to go next? (I have the addons but no stories) I was looking forward to elite spec but sadly not much hero points at the moment. 
---
What would be a good and affordable weapon and armor (warrior) right now? Looks aren‘t important atm, I‘d like good stats to set me up for further playing.
---
Also damn, I want to continue with my warrior but also try more classes (elite specs, playstyle, builds) all at the same time! 
---
Thanks for all the advice and help guys. If you can recommend any good videos/guides btw I wouldn’t say no to them.
---
Icebrood Saga is the closest thing to an expansion we are going to get sometime in November.
---
nope. living story continues with the icebrood saga
---
lol, we wont get any new expansion, this game is on maintenance mode and cash grabbing the last customer (see build templates etc)
---
Yes the expansion will take us on a land so far away it’s not actually part of the game /s
---
I'll check those out too, ty!
---
Will I be reprimanded if I talk about Hong Kong in the in-game chat?
---
what should i eat today?
---
Stop saying Maintenance Mode, it's just not true because content is still coming out (whatever the content is). Unfortunately, the cash grabbing part is a bit true.
---
No, they're returning to their original model of Living-World-story-only for a season (although keeping all the content around, unlike S1). It's the best they can do after half the studio got fired. There might be an expansion after that, but nothing is promised right now.
---
Oh yeah! That one assumption was quite puzzling, lol. I personally use a warrior, thief and mesmer (since the elementalists have the attunement effects around their hands).
---
Hi fellow editor, how do you decide if the stub tag should stay or not? Sometimes I complete a page, but then I'm not sure if it's really complete. What if I missed a node, or a for in some small corner, or an object that I don't have unlocked yet, etc.
---
Since they said they aren't currently working on an expansion, but it isn't off the table for the future then maybe at some point. The earliest it would probably be is 2 to 3 years away, which is optimistic. could be longer, or not happen at all.
---
Do you even know what maintenance mode is?  I don't think you do.
---
\^Same. If I'm solely doing wiki work while playing that means I'm taking weapon pictures, otherwise it's just play game and screenshot if something is shiny.
---
Astralaria - Not unknown but funny - when anything yeets you in the game(fire wallows in draconis monis for ex.), you get a long ass trail from Astralaria and it makes you look like a nyan cat with a space rainbow. 😹   
---
Nevermore(?) - sometimes those ravens scale with the enemy model and you get tree sized ravens. 😨  (I was just the confused 3rd party, re-evaluating my life that caused me to encountre a raven that covers my entire screen)
---
No you aren't, in pvp anyone on the opposite side is a target in any situation.
---
Maybe just for fire brand. But the dps rise isn't substantial.
---
rumours aka wishful thinking since 2012
---
If sorry, the translator also played against me. What I mean is, a server in the EU that more or less plays (approximately) at the time we play in NA (which is almost always after the reset in NA)
---
Gems are not a problem😅
---
Nice joke
---
If you have both expansions it will literally take you about 5-6 hours to max out both specs on your characters. Join a HoT and PoF hero point train. They will run 25 hero points in each set of maps to get you enough points to max a specialty each time. Super easy and they’re pretty regularly in LFG or find a guild that runs them
---
I don't want to be mean, but...  
---
jk, I'll be mean. You're playing an mmo. Let's repeat, an mmo. And you don't want to grind.  
---
Let's even ignore the fact that getting elite specs to max is 1-2h of running around.   
---
You don't want to grind in an mmo.   
---
I have something just for you, this way you should experience no grind whatsoever

---
Is probably my favorite page. 
---
My favorite change is most definitely when u/Cheftainalex fixed the location pages so they weren't generating wanted pages. Made the number of wanted links go from like 30k to 15k. Since on Wiki of Gold started up, the current number of wanted pages is down to under 4k. So thank you Alex!
---
leveling to lvl.80 isn't considered grind ?
---
Thanks, i guess i salvage it then. Last time i used them was for condi engi years ago, since then they gather dust in my bank.
---
I don't understand bitching about Holo in PvE. It's doing good, just git gud.
---
To all benchmarks-must-play-kiddos, PvE is not a benchmark. PvE is about skill and feeling of the class. 99,99% of players are not SC/LN level so don't focus on benchmarks that much.
---
Nope but I predict we will get a reveal at PAX Prime next year.
---
Posted this extremely late in the previous thread so don't think a lot of people had the chance to see it: "What are some everyday things I should be doing to efficiently gain some easy gold, besides daily achievements? I've just recently come back from a long break and started crafting my time gated pieces for ascended gear, not sure what else I should be doing every day while playing."
---
k
---
nah,its irony son,its fucking common sense that,if you crafting something so expensive,to look on wiki,vids about that item,with all posible animations and if you are not satisfied with that,shoud in LA *CAN SOMEONE PLS SHOW ME *INSERT LEGENDARY WEAPON/ARMOR/TRINKET*? its ez as that. if you are brave,you can ask that person,if he has necro or whatever you need to see. common sense ppl,try it.
---
See this is what happens when you destroy parts of the mists.
---
To be honest I've always found those guides a wee bit dry, so if it's not for you absolutely feel free to simply do a random edit and try something out.  
---
If you have information and don't want to drop it on the main page; each page has an associated talk/discussion page where you can ask for info/ask someone to update information X.  
---
You can also go on the gw2w discord server ([https://discord.gg/C4RMwPN](https://discord.gg/C4RMwPN)) and ask for some help on how to do X in a few of the channels
---
Most fun thing to document: How many times I die to NPCs while taking their picture. =D
---
I'm proud of the Shared Model Project. It was my first big shiny, and it is still my favorite shiny.
---
Probably the most memorable would be creating a large number of dedicated skin pages. It taught me a lot of the inner workings of the wiki just trying to take that project on. I re-familiarized myself with templates, learned about the API and Semantic MediaWiki properties, and mainly got comfortable with editing again after a long hiatus. Finally finding the unlisted skin ID for Caithe's Bloom Dagger (the impetus of the project) was a wonderful capstone moment.
---
As for something that I'm proud of, it's probably something at which I failed spectacularly. The wikki krewe was trying to figure out a way to organize all of our navigation templates which had become quite disparate and useless for navigating, specifically for professions, skills, and specializations. I thought I had hit on 'the' perfect solution, only to see it get a muted response. Rather than feeling insulted, I stuck around in the conversation, and happily saw others make [these expandable beauties](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warrior#External_links)! I'm quite happy that no one chose to champion my idea, lest we be lacking one of our better template styles.
---
I'm gonna echo this sentiment. I always have like 5+ tabs of the wiki open on my second monitor while I'm playing. It's absolutely invaluable. I would have been completely lost getting into / back into this and likely would have quit out of frustration. 
---
THANK YOU.
---
What do you suggest for GW2 to sell in their cash shop to continue funding the development of the game?
---
**I know the cost of development because I managed a development group.** Even a simple change has to be test coded in Sandbox, fully coded and documented in Development, tested (by others) in QA (and possibly kicked back for recoding), moved and tested again in Regression, and then moved to Production, and also likely F and S environments, so that the code can be hot fixed if there is an issue later in Production.
---
This is not costless. Given the known issues ([https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/231272908-Known-Issue-Tracker#top](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/231272908-Known-Issue-Tracker#top)) and the other stuff that needs to be developed that is more important, **this is a C priority at best** given that there is a known workaround.  I used to tell my clients that a trivial change was $25k, a minor change was $50k, and anything that I couldn't estimate in a minute in a meeting was $100k plus. **You may not like or want to hear this, but this is the reality of developing in a complex environment, and GW2 code is complex.**
---
Great! Thank you, for that and for all your job you people do. Gw2 wiki is almost my homepage 😀
---
I was thinking the same thing. I’ve been playing ESO. Their wiki gets the job done, but it comes nowhere near the functionality and comprehensive of this one.
---
bad pic. it only show page 1 of 31
---
*gundam intensifies*
---
If I were a mountain-sized monster, the last country on earth I'd go to is Japan. Fuck that. I'd go to Brazil or something.
---
I find that the atmosphere of the two wikis are slightly different.
---
The GW1 wiki had a large number of policies and rules which helped to codify how to do things, but hamstrung those who felt change was necessary.
---
The GW2 wiki has much looser guidelines with a [focus on consensus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Practices_and_processes). This approach allows for changes to occur in step with the community, but it can leave people feeling lost when looking for what's "right" or "wrong".
---
WVW? for other things lfg is the same regardless of server
---
The elite specs for engie are for people who don't like playing with kits. But anet thinks they are too good for how easy they are and nerfed the kitten out of them. So you might as well just play core as long as you don't do hardcore content.
---
With warrior, your main weapons will be axe/axe. Your top priority is unlocking expansion maps and getting the crap ton of hero points there to unlock the berserker elite spec.
---
For gear, get the cheapest, exotic, berserker stat (+power, + precision, +ferocity) armor and weapons (2 axes will do, a greatsword might be fun tho). You want full superior runes of vampirism for your amour, and a superior sigil of air and accuracy for each weapon SET you have. These runes and sigils are budget sigils that help a lot with open world. Trinkets are harder to get, but if you want to buy some berserker trinkets, feel free. If you buy some living world season 3 or 4 episodes, you can get ascended trinkets really easily.
---
So here is your [gear shopping list](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/tp/search?list=8145).
---
This (hopefully) lists the cheapest berserker armor and weapons and the runes and sigils I mentioned. You will notice, the boots already have the vampirism rune in it, so you will only need 5 vampirism tunes to complete the set.
---
Basically, buy the armor listed, and TWO of the axes. But FIVE superior runes of vampirism, one air sigil and one accuracy sigil. Put in the runes into the armor pieces EXCEPT for the boots. Put the air sigil in one axe, and the accuracy in the other. You’ll destroy the runes and sigils already in the weapons, but that is fine. IF YOU WANT TO, buy the greatsword, and an additional air and accuracy sigil. Put those into the greatsword, but make sure you use the two slots in the greatsword. This gear will be great for all of open world, and entry level fractals and raids! Best of all, you can INSTANT BUY ALL and it’ll be under 9-10g!
---
Now for the traits and rotations. [Sowcrows.com](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/warrior/banner/) is your friend for the best pve builds. You will focus on [core warrior banner](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/warrior/banner/) and [berserker dps](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/berserker/power/). Follow the traits and rotation carefully for the best results. You can drop the banner abilities in the core warrior build if you wish. Berserker is when you actually do insane dps, so make sure you unlock that quick. You’ll have some trouble with warrior without a lot of investment into gear, as you won’t crit cap, so you won’t have 100% critical chance. This kinda hurts your rotation, but it doesn’t need to be perfect. The actually correct stats, good runes and sigils, along with traits will make a HUGE difference.

Mac client updates, future directions like Metal adaptation etc., who is in charge at ArenaNet and who, how, where to contact about issue?
---
We've never had a mass wiki meet-up (though that would be really fun), but yes, a number of us have met IRL! PAX West is probably the event where the most wiki people gather, at least for the NA crowd, but there are also some more casual connections that have sprung up over the years when people realized "Hey, we live near each other!" I know of a few folks that met on the wiki and now have a regular board game night, for instance.
---
Hah. Thanks!
---
This sub hates content creators. Check news, you find videos downvoted every other day.
---
You actually don't need to know any html at all to help out on the wiki. There's one editor I know distinctly goes around catching spelling errors and letting us know that a spam bot created a page that needs to be deleted. That requires no technical knowledge at all just an eye to know that we don't need Canadian steroids for sale on the wiki, [that Logan is a human, not an asura](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Thackeray%27s_armor&amp;curid=200019&amp;diff=1375066&amp;oldid=1370251), and that I can't spell for beans. ;D
---
It has been brought up before and will likely be brought up again. One of our community members put [this overview](https://prezi.com/view/GBErVUBRlPkfS61Co5cC/) together for us. Perhaps someone with a bit more technical expertise may reply, here.
---
I got all his achievements, and never did he hide at the forge. Not once. I was basically convinced that this spot is a hoax until I saw him actually stand there in your video.
---
Weird.
---
RNG's gonna RNG I guess?
---
Running an invisible tag helps as you can mark things, but you can't squad up in personal story instances.  
---
I am forever annoyed at ANet for refusing to allow us to run the chat pane and the minimap pane on the same side. I've begged for this since launch and they refuse to make the UI more accessible. Frustrating, because one of the reasons I played GW1 is that its UI right out of the box was friendly to those with visual disabilities. GW2 went backward in functionality!
---
Some of us get a card for Christmas! 
---
Other than that, yes, we do get support from ArenaNet in some cases. Our awesome wiki liaison Stéphane has been a huge help in sharing information and images with us when we ask. :)
---
It looks great! Gold is meant to be spent, imo, on goals that make you happy. If the dye makes you happy, it was worth it.  
---
The first goal I set early on was to own every dye. I'm now off by about a dozen. Some people think that's silly, but the right dye makes a big difference and people do notice!
---
I don't think he cares as long as he can be edgy.
---
No questions but I wanted to tell you all that the wiki for this game is the best I’ve ever seen. I play a lot of different games and always expect them to be like that of Guild Wars 2, but they never are. Thank you for spoiling everyone that plays GW2 with such an incredible and constantly updated resource.

We have a wonderful liaison that we work with, [Stéphane Lo Presti](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Lo_Presti). If we're in need of anything, be it artwork for the new release or help with the wiki's backend, he's our go-to.
---
ArenaNet has been extremely accommodating with a project that they're funding, but have left in the hands of the community.
---
Nah. It's just that some of his minions gained the ability to make their own brandstorms.
---
Aurene will get there eventually and 'cleanse' [them](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&amp;q=iridescent+clouds).
---
Wiki contributors are not ArenaNet employees, so we don't know about their plans for the game or their internal structures beyond what's publicly visible. If you're having game-related issues, please reach out to ArenaNet support at http://help.guildwars2.com and open a ticket.
---
2027 is just around the corner, yay!
---
Sword feels terrible though. Ecsu holo feels also quite terrible. Forge 3-4 aa 3. leave forge -&gt; sword 2 + sword aa until at like 75 heat and repeat. Bonus points for using grenades and laser disk. The "feeling of the class" sucks in my eyes. Prestacking heat with ecsu is complete cancer and sword on its own just sucks. Engi has 3 weapons. why did they give it a single weapon as elite. Spellbreaker got mh + off.
---
He should be using that gold to upgrade his computer, duh.
---
ArenaNet also provide the gems given out as rewards for [On Wiki of Gold](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Projects/On_Wiki_of_Gold) (which is an otherwise entirely player-run project.)
---
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear? Lance?
---
That's a question I feel you'd be better off asking on the forums. Us wiki editors are just regular players just like you, and don't work for ArenaNet. The forums are a better place for your question as ArenaNet employees are more likely to see this question there than here. =)
---
It all depends on how things go.
---
If they get good revenue, they may afford more hiring and voice recordings and developing an expansion while they release episodic content.
---
If their revenue is not good, they'll have to cut expenditure and reduce what they can do, and stick to episodic content only.
---
To my fellow editors, what do you think is the biggest thing regular people get confused/don't know about in regards to the wiki. Other than "Everyone on the wiki is an ArenaNet employee".
---
Fun fact for non-wiki editors: We're all players just like ***you***. 99.9% of the editors on the wiki are not ArenaNet Employees. Our  liaison  [Stéphane Lo Presti](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/St%C3%A9phane_Lo_Presti) is the 1%. ;)
---
Converters can only consume between 150-250 dust a day.  If you play actively in some of the game's better farms, it's entirely possible to generate that much dust in a day's play.  So don't forget about that "destroy" button!
---
I personally have destroyed thousands upon thousands of Bloodstone Dust, Empyreal Fragments and Dragonite Ore with no regrets whatsoever.  Inventory space is valuable, letting items with negative value clog it up isn't a wise investment.
---
And the strongest attack isn't that strong. I avoid it every time, but other players just ignore the round platforms and just keeps mashing while hit.  
---
This boss would be a great opportunity to teach players how to think to beat mechanics. 
---
1. Make all avoidable attacks that do not require limited resources hit much harder. If you can jump over it, make it harder. If you can avoid it by staying outside of the area, make it hit harder.   
---
2. When a player gets defeated, show them a guide on how to avoid what killed them, like a video or an image inserted in a tooltip.
---
When I meet new players in-game the first thing I usually tell them is "/wiki is your best friend."
---
I'd like to take this moment to apologize to anyone who has ever been stuck trying to navigate through some item pages just to see where to get one! Sometimes Anet codes for account bound items to be contained in other items, which are contained in yet other items, which are given via mail to your inbox, which is sent to you because of a gem store purchase you need to make.
---
We are not documenting all of these steps because we're trying to drive you crazy; trust me, it drives us crazy, too. We're documenting the game as it is. If you find that a item is very detached from its ultimate source, feel free to add a comment to the page's Notes section, or leave us feedback asking if there's a way we can help clarify what's going on.
---
I'm so proud of you, Jaz :)

I actually remember the password! What I lost was the keystore that the password unlocks. See, in order to be distributed on the Play store an Android app has to be cryptographically signed with a developer's release key, which ensures (among other things) that a malicious actor can't trick users into installing a fake update to an app that they didn't publish. If two apps' signatures match but the keys don't, Android requires you to first uninstall the existing app so the new version can't pull out your local files and upload them to their own servers or other shady stuff like that. Those cryptographic keys are stored, naturally, in a file called a keystore. I made the app's source code publicly available on github, but for obvious reasons you should never make your keystore publicly available. However, in my infinite wisdom, I neglected to back up the keystore anywhere else! So when the laptop I had been using back then went kaput, I lost the the keystore and thus lost the ability to publish updates to the wiki app's Play store listing. When it stopped working correctly due to MediaWiki API changes, I had no choice but to pull it down. ):
---
At least in recent history, she just had public parties/squads dedicated to solving achievements right after an update. Also a Discord server.
---
Once we've accrued enough good will from the community, we're looking to trade that in for world domination. A few of us have some inroads with some Elder Dragons.
---
That aside, we're always open to suggestions! I liken the wiki to a lumbering giant in that it can be slow to move at times or it can lurch suddenly with a big change. The wiki project is by players for players, so input from non-editors are just as valuable as from those who do edit.
---
Yeah WvW
---
I support this!
---
Not sure why you ask this now? They are making the saga which will likely take a year or more before it ends. With that they will release expansion content as well. After the Saga we do not know what is about to happen they just said a expac is not off the table.
---
my problem has been solved by update
---
Im in NA and play on EU ( for now ) it will depend on what you do in game, if you are doing the map metas you can usually find a map until around 7-9pm EST, if you are doing WvW you will want something like Gandara ( they seem to have the most coverage into late NA ) you might get away with Desolation too, most other WvW servers are dead after 7pm EST,
---
If your goal is to do raids or fractals, unless you can get on earlier in the day around 2-3pm EST you will want to move to an NA server, or find a dedicated guild that runs them off hours.
---
Seriously screw that guy and his poorly telegraphed knockdown flip.
---
If you want to contribute to the wiki actively, let me quote another wiki editor:
---
" The wiki can seem offputting because it's pretty big and complex and we use some fairly advanced stuff sometimes... but on the whole, it's really quite straightforward.
---
Refer to [Help:Editing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Help:Editing), [Help:Tables](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Help:Tables), and [General formatting](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:General_formatting) for some guides on basic editing. Don't be afraid to jump in and start making changes even if you think you won't get it right! We always welcome good-faith efforts to improve the wiki, and someone more experienced can (and will!) come along to fix any mistakes while you're still getting the hang of it. :)" - Idris\_wiki
---
If you still feel overwhelmed, you can always use the "leave article feedback" button at the top of the page to let us know of anything we could add to the article, anything that is wrong etc..
---
That being said, even the smallest change can be important and feedback is always welcome and appreciated.
---
Why are you so wonderful and perfect and the best game wiki ;-;
---
We are *so* spoiled by you guys. I die a little inside every time some game turns out to only have a trash Wikia/Fandom wiki that never gets updated and is full of ads ;-;
---
Idris covered this already pretty well in a [previous comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dgsnge/we_are_the_community_behind_the_official_guild/f3egvh8/) :)
---
But seriously, every bit helps! Whether you're only fixing a typo or uploading a better quality image, the Wiki is better for it.
---
it's just a site update :D
---
If you're truly minmaxing on a deadeye, pick the asura because norn will just be a bigger target out in the field and asura with its smaller frame will make better (IMHO) use of the thief's natural spinny mobility along the way.
---
Are you using the UESP wiki or that gross fextalife / fandom one?
---
In UESP's defense, they're a wiki for ALL the Elder Scrolls games, so they can't just focus on ESO.
---
You've been playing since release but cant post an lfg for a legendary bounty? FeelsBadMan
---
I actually thought this was a troll haha
---
Not to be sentimental, but my single favorite page on the wiki is the [one we made earlier this year](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Wiki:Love4ArenaNet) following ArenaNet's layoffs where we invited players to share their wishes for the departing developers. I think this really showed the best of our community, and I'm very proud of it.

I just like helping. Even if life is really mega super busy, I always try to poke my head in to make sure that everybody's okay and nobody's running with scissors(so to speak).
---
I *desperately* wish that Digital Extremes would take a page from Arenanet's book here and host the Warframe wiki. Even with ad blockers, I still get stupid Fandom crap on the bottom of the WF wiki pages :/
---
UESP.  It’s good, but not nearly as good.
---
Context?
---
Ehhh you should probably ask that in wow subreddit first. I doubt something is gonna change, corporate public fuckups happen all the time and the average wow player isnt affected much if at all. Even if they were to mass-migrate they would probably go to final fantasy as it is the most popular mmo atm and sticks to the traditional MMO structure, it is much closer to wow in terms of gameplay,content and progression.

The melee classes that deal big crits are warrior (especially axe/axe berserker dps) and guardian (greatsword + sword/focus or scepter/focus). Warrior has bashy weapons, guardian is still bashy weapons but also magic, take your pick
---
No

Honestly, the reason we're able to maintain the wiki with no ads or interruptions and with such regular, high quality updates is because of ArenaNet's hosting, support, and promotion. Speaking as a survivor of the original GuildWiki, whose treatment at the hands of Wikia falls just shy of violating the Geneva Convention, I'm incredibly grateful that ArenaNet given us both a stable platform as well as absolute editorial independence. It's a great environment in which to contribute, and I'd love to see other game companies provide their communities with the same.
---
[April fools 2018](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day_2018/Clip-o-tron_memorial) was pretty good. We added microsoft's annoying Clippy assistant to the site for the day. We got complaints on random talk pages asking how to silence it, and asking where the glass-tapping noise was coming from.
---
Having a greater majority of players prefer playing soulbeast, condibrand, dh, and various other meme builds over support classes says nothing about the viability of support classes.
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Doodleplex/Silly\_Things](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Doodleplex/Silly_Things) For the funny. For favorite page,  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scholar\_Wikki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scholar_Wikki) because it's the wiki's NPC. ;)
---
Since you go into detail it wasn’t even a once omg moment. It was several omg moments over a few weeks as I would discover new features I wasn’t aware. The biggest one is when I accidentally dragged and dropped to rearrange in the order that I want and deleting the metas I didn’t want. 
---
And I like anything with the total cost of making something with short overview linked to tp.
---
My brothers cousins fathers sons best friends grandpa works for areanet. He said we get canta with rightualist in 2 weks
---
The GW2 wiki is easily one of the most well run, complete, and frequently updated wikis for any game that I've played. A huge thank you for all of your hard work!
---
You are my hero. That NPC missing an image has been bugging me for years. Thank you! ; \_ ; &lt;3
---
/wiki ET and /wiki PSNA are probably my most used web pages
---
I love the strike mission. I run it every day (i go and pre-lit the beacon before LFG) and it's a blast.
---
I play Healbrand on it. People says it's useless but when i don't i always, 100% some people get downed. This way i can give everyone stab, quickness, fury and might *AND* everyone has a good easy time.
---
I have gotten 2 shoulder chests so far. My friend that runs with me got 2 too, and theres always someone getting a drop every other day or at least every 3 days. It's probably around 3-5% drop chance (or maybe my squads are lucky).
---
I like it more than raids even if it's too easy. I can't stand the tryhardiness of raids, especially since most raids are easy AF and it's been proven you can do them in greens or with 4 people, and still you are asked for 250 li full ascended meta build and get snowcrow performance at a golem to be able to join for some golem boss like mo or sammy or vg or something lol... Lucky for us w7 is probably the last one and we are just getting strikes from now on.
---
Someone starts a squad of 20+ people who all run from hero point to hero point completing them together. It takes a couple hours and is the best way to take care of HoT points.
---
&gt;  I just want to make another character to try something different lol, even tho I can experiment with the specs I have avaible it will take a lot of time to max the spec and I can't bring myself to do it.
---
So you don't have an hour to run a hero point train on your max level character but you have 50 hours to level up another character to max level?   
---
Cool story bro.
---
I have literally done strike mission since day 2 of the realease (skipped only once) and i literally haVe NO CLUE of what the hell you are talking about. Like Ive never seen that?
---
To OP: in my oppinion best way is to run full DPS to kill the boss as fast as possible, so it does less attacks, and bring some supports to give blocks and stuff. I play healbrand and with one in the squad you can literally not move and you will take little to no damage
---
Healing Power/Toughness/Condition Damage. Not 3 defense stats, 2. You're right in that running 3 offense stats is going to go through content faster than 1. That's not what I was saying. I was saying that Toughness+Healingpower &gt; Vitality+Healing Power. Also, strength is a relative term. I ran this build even when Full Berzerker D/D core thief was the meta roam in WvW vanilla, and I ate those thieves for breakfast.
---
The boss has two phases:
---
* Phase 1: It mostly slams its huge arm creating large weaves and 'bullet hell' balls. You can just stack on the boss, ignore the balls, and jump over the waves.
---
* Phase 2: It will now do frequent fan attacks covering a large area, and produce 2 or more circular platforms that fire balls around. Like before, you can just stack on the boss and simply move away from the fan attacks. 
---
 * Eventually, the boss will slam one of those platforms, and create a large wave that is too high to jump over it.  You can ignore stability, protection, regen, healing and all that cowardly nonsense and just jump on a different platform, jump off it, and continue the DPS until the next large wave.
---
If the dedicated players are 5% of the population and considers them trash, and like... 25% of the population considers them fun, then they are fun. 
---
I run the SM every day and for my friends and me it's fun, also NOONE EVER in my squads said they had a bad time.
---
Compare to raids where u spend more time in lfg getting that *totally needed i swear* minmaxed comp... At least with strikes i can PLAY THE GAME.
---
Oh I see, basically just nuking the trial bosses. Sounds cool lol
---
We can only hope of one after the Icebrood Saga, but nothing official yet.
---
[deleted]
---
I get that the subreddit is all down on these and whatnot, but my Pvp queue times are fast (often faster than my WoW arena and BG queues were), and the WvW in my bracket usually has 2 maps maxed out with a queue, and we're not tier 1. Where does this sentiment come from, just like super high end play?
---
As someone who plays moderately casual, the modes seem to be populated for me...
---
Perfect! Thank you very much for answering!
---
* There's no "best" for PvP. If there was, the balance team would have to fix that asap. Some builds can be more successful on average than others in certain PvP seasons, but that will not last.
---
* What's more fun for PvP depends greatly on personal taste. My favorite are "versatile balanced" builds meant to both take and do decent amounts of damage and that have different tools to address various problems and a decent amount of crowd control, but others may prefer going tanky and act as a bunker sitting on a point, or very mobile and decapture enemy points quickly, or opportunistic glassier cannons that avoid combat as much as they can until an enemy is primed for a quick burst and finish.  
---
Firebrands, engineers and mirages with spammy gimmick builds are problably having the most fun these days. 
---
* All professions have melee options, and all have high direct damage options with big crits. Some elite specializations are better than others at it, but they all can do it too.
---
The best way for you to find what you will like is trying it all by yourself.
---
Choya
---
Funny how there's barely 1 queued map every other day during the week unless your server is overstacked. Reset says nothing about general population because everyone logs in to play then and even in that scenario you can usually find 2 active maps because most servers just dont have high enough coverage in those hours. 4 queued maps on one server doesnt mean that all servers in same matchup will have the same amount of players.
---
Okay its active for one hour a week.... Husk
---
You are clearly worried enough to provide a response now.
---
As others have pointed out, you are welcome to run non-meta things but promoting them as a good option isn't helpful. You still need to know your builds well to play something that is "meta", the difference is just that your build needs to be concerned about burst rotations for a single veteran mob while other alternatives like power staff Daredevil or M7 trickery rifle Deadeye are more concerned about large packs of elites and vets or champs.
---
You can simply do more with objectively stronger builds because those "burst" rotations are going to be an awful lot harder hitting than a thief messing about with acrobatics and healing and vitality stats while also providing more healing through sensible use of abilities such as Mug, M7 and Invigorating Precision.
---
cool story bro
---
Like what? Because trust me i'm able to argue whatever content you enjoy is bad.
---
I hit end game and I liked helping new players get into the game. I got really good at typing guides in chat,  then realized that the fractal guides were out dated. I went and started doing fixes here and there on strategies. Then I copy edited new guides,  then I went and started scavenger hunting images that were missing,  and it became like another way to play the game. :)
---
Oh nice. I never paid attention to the platforms i will try to remember after reset. I just aegis and stab that stuff!
---
I wholeheartedly disagree.
---
Its not always hard,  but annoying are the thief stolen skills. You can steal 20 times from one mob and get 2 skills,  then on the 21st you get the 3rd. I had a separate trait setup on arc just for stealing CDs.
---
You will be back to blizzard games before gw2 gets third expac
---
The GW2W was the first and only wiki I contributed to. I think at some point I'd love to help out with the original wikipedia as well though!
---
Most proud: creating [GW2W easy mode](http://mymeanderingmind.com/GW2W_Easy_Mode/) which gives editors a skeleton page for any items/achievements/skills/skins on the api.
---
Most fun thing to document: Honestly it was probably the first few raids we had. I also fondly remember my hate for [short bow pages](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Beastslayer_Short_Bow&amp;action=history)
---
Some tips for getting started: 
---
Make sure you remove your hud overlay (ctrl shift h ?).
---
Try to take high contrast pictures. If lighting is too hard,  torches do provide some light,  but aren't ideal. 
---
Try not to have NPCs selected. An outline highlights them and a circle appears under them. Thieves are quite fun for getting up close pictures of aggro mobs. 
---
Upload images as jpeg, not png. Png files take up a lot of space and that level of detail isn't very necessary unless it's for a skill icon. 
---
Try not to use 3rd party shaders. 
---
And while corny to say,  have fun. It's all a game and there's no such thing as a perfect picture :)
---
The BEST in pvp is the amount of serious spvp players is so low, wintrading got realy cheap and affordable
---
i cant stop laughing. made my day!
---
We also use preview streams and notes to set up bare bones pages ahead of time. It helps that our general formatting is copy paste able. (For example,  the warclaw wiki page started as soon as it was announced and was mostly filled by the time release hit)
---
low usage % is only due to this thing not being mobile friendly, imo
---
imaging typing /wiki in game and getting your article open up in the mobile app
---
/app
---
what did i miss here oO
---
Best places to farm wood? Asking for both dailies/regions (except Orr), and for wood types (specifically soft, seasoned, and hard).
---
I started off on PvX wiki, the build wiki for GW1. It was completely different to the gw2 wiki, with most of the site being about rating other people's builds, and debating the benefits. I didn't really understand at that point how much of working with others is about compromise - i'm still shit at compromising but sometimes i will try and have a constructive argument about things I believe in.
---
Firstly I just want to say thank you for your work. 
---
I guess I need a question....
---
Do you guys know that I love you for the work you've done?
---
oh hell, anet should add an emote for each time we use /wiki and technically afk from the game, our character needs to represent
---
\+1 for the artwork comment. I think I asked him for 2-3 LS episodes to provide us with the promo image for the wiki, and now I don't even have time to notice there's a promo image before he has it uploaded and pinged in the discord server. The man is a machine.
---
i think it is because of the near camp that ppl are more in fight and conquer mode at harpy. during inbetween warg and camp is a longer distance with water to cooldown ;)
---
I've made a handful of edits to other game wikis and wikipedia in the past, and I've occasionally helped out people who wanted to start wikis for new games and needed some pointers, but by far the lion's share of my work has been on GuildWiki (the original, unofficial Guild Wars 1 wiki), GWW, and now GW2W.
---
We do now! :D
---
I go in spurts. I did a lot of content guides for fractals,  raids, and wvw (my baby). I was maybe 70/30 edit/playing for awhile. Now I go a few months without then a few weeks on. Its nice to not have hard commitments to editing. It lets me enjoy it :)
---
I dont think WvW was intended to be a 50v50 mode with no roaming or small scale fights.
---
Calling people no life trolls because somehow your server cant get 3 people with roaming builds to defend routes for reinforcements is also pretty idiotic.
---
Ahh yes. Back to not having a decent response.
---
You do realise it's just you that looks bad acting like that?
---
Anyway! Have a lovely weekend and enjoy spending absolutely ages on trivial mobs and misleading players with poor advice!
---
Is it possible for you to create a multiple level tutorial for creating new Wiki pages AND editing existing pages?  A tutorial and practice space where we can experiment and try out what is being learned?  A tutorial with a lot of hand holding and spending a great time on the first beginner levels?  With additional ones to take us from beginner to advanced at a slow and very easy page?  
---
Can tutorials show us, additionally, how to perhaps copy templates of existing pages to very easily and quickly create new pages with other tutorials stepping us through the entire process of creating a new one ourselves?
---
Dang that's disappointing. Well I can give it a go and see if it's fun, if not, there are other games to play. I have too much of a backlog anyway.
---
Imagine if the "update" arrived a week early.
---
Everyone rushes to LA only to find cardboard cutouts of the doors and Thorn laughing at them.
---
*-casually hides the sliced "cactus" table-*
---
I can share this feeling, helping with it just makes me feel like being part of something and it's nice helping others somehow (either with editing itself as with the accuracy of the info itself).
---
I had to manage down to the level of WBS estimates from developers, so I mostly know how to call BS when sub-projects are over-estimated or under-estimated. 
---
I also managed both 3 and 7 system environments, and while I really prefer 3 (DQP), larger projects with millions of lines of code usually couldn't live with only D-Q-P, and needed S-D-Q-R-P plus F and X, which really ballooned the cost of development. I'm ASSuming that GW2, based on developer comments, is spaghetti code that's complex to manage simply because of poor documentation and the risk associated with cascade failures caused by a simple change.
---
As an olive branch, I like your original suggestion. But it's simply not high on my priority list, and, assuming limited funds (development hours), I'd rather they work on stuff that is really lacking in the game.
---
It's sad that it takes Blizzard to fuck up monumentally to bring new people to GW2. Like if the latter didn't have anything to present other than "well, we *didn't* bow down to China, that's a feature".
---
I've written a lengthy explanation at a salty guardian main before about how core virtues &gt; DH virtues are an upgrade not a trade off lol. The only notable difference is the marginal "cast time" which is nothing compared to the 5 second cooldown that photon forge puts on kit swapping. Then he tried to say that DH's trade off was giving up another trait line, as if every other class doesn't have to do that as well.  
---
I don't hate DH/FB for not having trade offs. I just use it to point out that "trade offs" is a buzzword anet used temporarily to justify heavy handed nerfs. Tempest/Weaver have no trade offs either. Soulbeast has no trade off. Berserker -sort of- has a trade off now though I'd still consider it a direct upgrade personally, but Spellbreaker doesn't. The idea of "trade offs" is bullshit because it only affects a limited selection of elite specs and was only a thing for a single patch, and then promptly forgotten.
---
This drawing has a feminine face, but isn’t the character male?
---
PogChamp
---
Seeing tens of people unable to use their fucking ccs and unable to break even ONE BAR on twin bosses, every day for a month, made me give up on making friends along the way.
---
You said it better than I could.
---
I think OP is an open world player who may or may not dabble with low fractals or dungeons with his engi. Thats the only way I see him valuing a tanky flamethrower build with turrets that take aggro over what elite specs have to offer.
---
There isn't much more relation with anet devs than any other players. The only exception is probably that we get to talk to Stephan (the wiki liaison) a bunch to ask for more info and details.  
---
I have yet to be able to leverage my position as a wiki editor for a free legendary.
---
Some people are really playing something else than berserker?
---
Ok, how about how we got bored of waiting for ArenaNet to update their map tiles endpoint, and when every update hits, [I have to do this stupid process](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Chieftain_Alex/raster_tiles#Process) to create the tiles.
---
Every other widget to integrate with the API is pretty much a copy-paste job - [see this category](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Category:Widgets).
---
edit: u/Da_Anh reminds me that the first API integration widget was the hungry cat one.
---
I am a NA player on EU servers I am EST U.S. timezone. Generally the maps don't start getting sparse til 9-10pm EST during the weekday. On weekends usually even at 12am EST U.S. there are more than enough people for metas on.Even then there are usually some Comms doing bounties at PoF,possible Dragonfall and some other pve stuff. Fractal wise you going to need to simply pug or join a guild that has active players that play around your time or just make some similar timezone ingame friends.
---
Exactly, you should have 250 hero points in around 2 hours or so
---
And WvW? I'm play few pve 😅
---
Welcome to raiding and T4’s
---
Having read all that... the tedious trauma inducing process of "simple picture scaling colashs" gives me newfound appreciation to your work.
---
Most of the time the reason we can't do more DPS is because we have to baby-sit over-aggressive DPS players with a limited pool of builds that think they're way better than they actually are.  The reality is that they tend to be selfish and terrible team-players.
---
What's the condi dps scrapper build and how does scrapper give itself and the squad boons?
---
Lovely, thank you for sharing. :)
---
You mean holo? Because I don't think there's a condi scrapper build, much less a power scrapper build. 
---
 https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/holosmith/condition/
---
the thing is, if you give the "rare" boons to more builds you run into the risk of..well exactly what's happening right now with people stacking DHs for fmw to bypass the need for support
---
firebrigade is broken not because of those boons but because of how insanely stacked their kits are(and the fact that unlike wells you can just press a magic button whenever you feel like it)
---
soulcleave is almost like having an extra healer without the usual healer dps of 2k or whatever..firebrand tomes are simply crazy full with utility and the dps version hits pretty hard, especially when you get f1 resets
---
i do agree on one thing, boons such as might and fury should be more widely available..especially for 10 people at once which is what keeps druid meta
---
I think OP's aim is to have multiple AI that take aggro for him. So yeah its pretty much like playing minionmancer in engi. 
---
His build would be suitable for afk farming as you say, though for that purpose I would pick one more turret over flamethrower.
---
Not in the AMA but I do edit the wiki frequently so I'll say my funnies.
---
Does GWW count for these? Because the most memorable thing would be when we were setting up the interactive maps on GWW; I didn't have much hand in it other than userability feedback (though eventually I did figure out how the coordinate system worked on the maps and helped fix things here and there).
---
Proudest thing I contributed to would probably be bringing the lore articles up to par on GWW. There was *so* much speculation and false information when I had begun editing.
---
Most fun thing to document would be when I fixed up The Lost Shore phase subpages. I found it very fun digging through other articles, old youtube videos, and other guides to try to piece everything together properly. Been meaning to fix up other Season 1 stuff but I'm always distracted.
---
Before chrono gave resistance+a lot aegis or disto+ stabi :)
---
For weapons, I assume it's for mystic forge gambling wherein you put 4 rares of the same weapon type and hope for a precursor.
---
The armor though, no idea.
---
&gt;GW1 is smaller and "finished", so there are less gaps that need filling in.
---
There's still some major gaps though. Particularly with the EotN bounty NPCs' dialogues (which, admittedly, is very time consuming to document).
---
Sounds like Warrior and Thief are your cup of tea.
---
But if you want to try something different, Mesmer is a mage capable of high melee damage and Holosmith is a melee spec for a ranged class.
---
That being said, cancelling your WoW sub won't help anyone in Hong Kong. I understand its about making a statement but the only thing you're actually accomplishing is not playing a game you like.
---
Smalo details (:
---
Remember Ascalon
---
I have never felt so vindicated by an online comment before.
---
Respect❤
---
That sounds like a good way for start editing, I'll keep that in mind!
---
Thank you for my next wallpaper
---
it's amazing how poorly my daily fractal runs go whenever i try to do anything but HB because pug supports so often think "all i have to do is spam feel my wrath, healing bow, and empower :)"
---
Try reaper. Pretty simple rotation and a good dps.
---
Actually, they're male character options in game.  I just outright refuse to follow the trend of MALE CHARR BIG, BULKY, HULK. RAAAWR.  
---
Much rather play to the sleeker aesthetic of the feline aspects of the race, rather than the bulky one.
---
I saw loads of these recently.
---
thank you!  
---
I don't have much experience with wiki editing, but there are some good suggestion thrown at me here, I'm thinking the easiest way to start is just to copy the template of a page and just translate the text. I haven't read the guides yet, but I'll make sure at least I've gone through them before starting.  
---
I hope I can get into this, I'm always translating for my friends and guildies, so it seems to me it's more efficient to put that effort where everyone can use it.
---
I imagine the talk/discussion page is different for each language, but maybe I can drop translations there if I find the editting too overwhelming at first.  
---
I haven't read the guides yet, but I'll check them out anyways, thanks for the discord link though, that will be a great help. I hope this encourages other people too to start helping!
---
Depending on what you are looking for, ranger can be a lot of fun for open world group content like world bosses. Also great class for soloing if you run with a tanky pet. Play it right and you can solo group events in exotic gear without much trouble at all.
---
I have a lot of fun with mine, sit back with a longbow for easy tagging and zerg events or switch it up to a greatsword for small group work.
---
This is every mmo ever, the tank/healers/support master race.
---
love the vid, also, how did you make your TP look compacted?
---
I should start using that phrase when downing an enemy player in pvp and wvw which take place in the Mists. It's the proper way to honor that lovable if treacherous rascal. :)
---
type "I am Evon Gnashblade" in search bar
---
One more PSA:
---
&gt; **Unused Glyph Slot**
---
Thanks for sharing! I like the composition and the use of shadows in your piece which give Jake volume. Our treacherous thief friend would be *honored* (to Grenth with that word!) to be remembered by such a lovely tribute. :)
---
" piss supports off, and we'll just run with friends." talk about yourself plz. Don't put me in the bag with your holyness the super elite PvE support.
---
and then what will everyone do ? it's not like everyone can make everyclass !! We'r doomed !!
---
You may be right , but the way you self glorify yourself like your some sort of saviour , in gw2 PvE ...  it just feels like my little brother explaining why in LoL or OW he dies cause "the team sucks", both may be right but jesus it really sounds like you should be soloing shit if you have so much talk.
---
If everyone stops playing support classes in open groups , ppl will just flock to support and repopulate it , like it happens in every game, since they would get easier groups.
---
I have had situations were I feel support sucks , and sometimes that dps sucks , and while I may be enfuriated on those times I do not need to write an essay that basically reads "The 10 reasons why I'm so important while I'm being condescendent to others. ", I either don't care or if I act I try to fix the problem, not be " Look at me so important , you all don't get it cause your dumb".
---
Seems your only choices are to play with friends , or come and QQ here how important you are cause of your chosen class, I hope you choose wisely.
---
Yes, i do pug and yes, i play support classes occasionally. It clearly does not feel like that once you surpass tier 3 fractals.
---
Is there anyone experienced with ripping models from the game so screenshots of models (especially hostile ones) would be much easier to be taken? Most of my contribution to the wiki is [providing screenshots for enemies in game](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Special:ListFiles/Hansmith)  . Some of them are really tough to be made such as [Pestilent Golem](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Pestilent_Golem.jpg) due to them being being part of popular meta and not really good options to completely remove players and their effects.
---
I wish there was a possibility to make private/local servers like WoW so I could have much easier time for this heh.
---
Very Educational
---
BRUH this is eye opening thanks!
---
i'm pretty sure all classes can do all PvE content, at the very endgame if your considering raids you want want to do pugs and you'll want to join a guild for it so you won't need to worry about invites.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
different classes perform better/worse at different raids so it never truly matters which one you specifically select. I have all characters at 80 and i have always loved mesmers even since guild wars 1 so i was mainly focused on that. However, recently i decided to give the reaper necro a shot and OMG i have just fallen in love with it, so much more than i ever did on my mesmer. It can solo anything open world wise with ease and just melts the majority of mobs whilst having great sustain.
---
Best thing to do is just play the game to start with, each class has 3 specializations from standard to HoT to PoF specs so there's alot to unlock and test before you get the feel for each one.
---
Hi everyone,
---
I often see people say something spawn near them and it's near the "Tag". What do they mean? are those the icon I see on map? aren't those for "Mentors" only?
---
Also, what exactly does Map bonus mean? I see the zone has "Map Bonus", but I'm not sure when I get them?
---
It has almost no cast time, it has zero tell, and even if they triple dodge they get out of the range for YOU to mount up again (because once you reach a certain range away, you leave combat.  It's almost exactly enough time to catch up to them JUSt when their warlcaw dismounts from the burn ticks, that continue to keep them in combat for several seconds after they dismount)  before their own warclaw falls, giving you time to catch them.  I've done exactly that hundreds of times.  stone heart dire weaver, the build I run it on, is also nearly immune to power ranger... and in fact can 3-5v1 pretty much every power build... which is what most roamer killers are running.
---
You haven't played engiee much if you question why two turrets and a flame thrower. Esp as a scrapper.  Since day 1 gyros have been discount turrets. Tho now that they are wells they have some use i guess.
---
Turrets scale decently enough and basically act as free  damage, esp since last i checked might applied to you buffs your turrets. Flame thrower builds 30+ might esp with scrapper and provides a decent chunk of self healing along with healing turret.  Flame turret + another can be very useful sources of free damage (not much else to put in them) 
---
I mostly did spvp and wvw with my set up, and higher level fractals. Never was a fan of raids.
---
I love how everyone assumes I'm trying to be a tank. 
---
I do need to play around with the new gyros, and yall are right supply crate is trash. But then again pretty much all engineer elite skills are haha. Adds abit of burst i guess? 
---
And holo i wouldn't exactly call the damage insane, considering it has absolutely terrible synergy with the rest of the class, and its own skills are decentish? Yet now that they shut down your toolbelt and kits...it kinda drives home the fact that holo has poor synergy with core even more. 
---
I agree engineer is in a bad place, but don't crap all over a tried and true build that has been a core engineer build since hot came out. And i see nothing to indicate that it doesn't work any more.
---
At least  not worse then anything else.
---
Its a brawler build,  that holds a point well, can dish out heavy damage, and  now self applies a ton of barrier as well as might.
---
Absolutely the best wiki for any game I've ever seen. I've been playing some classic wow lately and it really surprised me how much worse the wow wiki is despite the behemoth community it has. Y'all are killing it. 👏
---
Anims, no. Meshes, yes, but static.
---
IS there any chance that anet will reduce the time it takes to grind WvW legendary armor from 6 months to 3 months to be in line with PvP and PvE legendary armors?
---
I have half a set of WvW legendary armor already but my new job makes it difficult to spend the time necessary to complete the WvW legendary set.
---
Condi is really strong but from my few attempts with it is that if alacrity is lacking or you have to do mechanics during the Weave Self opener you will be really sad. Also your cc output is very low and you really don't want to interupt your rotation for it while fresh air weaver has about 1000 break bar damage that can be dealt within a short time at any given time and can easily continue the rotation.
---
Condi is maybe a little harder to play than the power variant, but not by a huge amount in my opinion. The condi build is fine for open world, as a lot of the damage is from burns, which ramp up damage quickly compared to other conditions.
---
You definitely want focus for the condi build (mainly because of flame wall and transmute fire aura), but there is also a dagger/focus build which might be what you saw? The sword/dagger build is power.
---
Viper armour has to be crafted for the most part, but what you can do is make a cheaper ascended set like berserkers, then stat swap it to Vipers.
---
 Thanks for your feedback! I LOVE to draw in black and white \^ \_ \^ 
---
We thank Jake for his many sacrifices XD
---
Imagine if a death knight had a blind cousin that was more interested in staves and shields than big swords or huge damage ticks.
---
Edit: it does offer somewhat of a plated thief build though thanks to one of the spirits whose power you channel.
---
So you're basically playing how the support is supposed to play and cry that dps players don't recognize you. That's how the game works tho, I think that in my 10 years of playing support online I've been recognized for that only a handful of times, and that's mostly in lol XD  
---
Try to focus more on internal gratification, not external, it works pretty well
---
[Glyphs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_(upgrade\)) are minor improvements to gathering tools (of varying usefulness). Older tools didn't have any glyphs so were just unlimited and slightly faster but did have a unique skin. Newer tools outside of sales are priced identically to the old ones but have inbuilt glyphs which are often otherwise expensive by themselves on the Trading Post.
---
The absence of the glyph is the reason for such a discount, so if you only want these very skins and the basic faster/unlimited utility, that's a reasonable purchase considering you can reskin and reglyph tools anyway.
---
 Wait.  
---
 If you do it, I definitely want to see the screen ahahahaha
---
I, too, like to look for legitimate lore reasons to abuse rat people.
---
If it was an unbreakable tools with a very useful glyph (reaping especially for home instance) at such prices, I might consider it for alt accounts.  But if one doesn't desire glyphs, great deal.
---
&gt; **Initially, the challenge of Inktober was focused on traditional inking.** Although learning how to ink digitally is a skill separate from traditional inking it is no less valid.
---
Of course there are, and while I mostly know the raiding point of wiev I can plan around hitting the boons right where everyone will be once the well expires and make sure I take care of the mechanics, adds and proper tanking as a chrono or swap attunements, blast boons and cleanse at the right time as a healing tempest. I only get nasty when the dps get unreasonable and blame me for getting downed somewhere far away from the group in multiple aoes or cry about the boons after I see them running out of every well or, recently, not being near the group - that shatter has a pretty small radius, probably the same as "distort greens" back in the day.
---
Are you sure that's not Uncategorized?
---
Lmfao. Good one Bovan!
---
Of course it’s not less valid, but let’s not misuse terms. If you had to describe the medium of the picture you’d say it’s digital, not ink
---
Very nice parody, I personally found it funny as always. :D  
---
One question though, how did you make your trading post look different ? o.o
---
This reminds me, there's a tumblr blog named talk-of-tyria that records NPC chatter all around Tyria. Might be helpful to you guys, but even if it's not, it's still very cool! :)
---
That's *literally from the Inktober FAQ!* Initially the focus was on traditional inking, but as the event got popular they decided to be inclusive of digital mediums as well, because gatekeeping is stupid. [But don't take my word for it, clicky click on the underlined sentence instead.](https://inktober.com/faq)
---
Again...
---
&gt; Inktober is a month long art challenge created by artist Jake Parker that is focused on improving skill and developing positive drawing habits.
---
I don't get why you're so set on gatekeeping drawing, it's ridiculous.
---
I’v seen players jumping over the towers gates in WvW, what profession and skill allows that? Or is it a bug?
---
If i didnt have to work today, id reinstall and join
---
So people will keep on saying that but yet they are comming back to GW2 PvP because of the combat. I would say rather watch Sindrener who also took a break and playing classic WoW and are back to streaming some PvP. He is litterally the God of PvP and you should be able to see what PvP can offer you.
---
Anyway link to his channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXQEmr_-XvMRSIKJg4MDMIA/videos
---
Omg it works and are so easy to do.
---
Already made 3k gold just today, be quick before anet will catch wind of this and will get nerfed!!!
---
Old Loin's Arch sure warms my loins
---
Who uses bow ROFL bro get some decent utilities.
---
That Durarara OP music &lt;3
---
Yeah by definition digital inking isn't inking cause it doesn't use physical ink, just like digital shopping isn't shopping cause you don't go to a physical shop.
---
If you're not trying to gatekeep I have no idea why you'd be this obtuse.
---
Cheap salvaged excellences anyone?
---
It would be an interesting tie-in for sure as there's enough ambiguity in that fractal's setting to allow for it (especially because of all those golem bosses and because devs said that all the fractals we've seen so far have been set in the past). There is (or was?) supposedly even ambient dialogue at the Golem Mines involving Snaff and golems:
---
&gt; **Peacemaker Officer (1):** The Peacemaker golems certainly are functioning well these days.  
---
&gt; **Peacemaker Officer (2):** Not too may hiccups. Remember when Snaff lost control of them? What a mess.  
---
&gt; **Peacemaker Officer (1):** Don’t let Zojja hear you say that. As far as she's concerned, Snaff could do no wrong.  
---
It would be nice if there really was a tie-in between Snaff's little debacle and the great uprising of the past. If combined with other ambient dialogue about someone figuring out how to remove the inhibitor to cause another golem uprising but this time for nefarious purposes, we could see the likes of Overseer Kuda or steam creatures attempt a takeover this way. :)
---
&gt; **Peacemaker Officer (1):** So, what should we do in the case of a golem uprising?  
---
&gt; **Peacemaker Officer (2):** Impossible. The sedition inhibitor prevents any insurgent behavior.  
---
&gt; **Peacemaker Officer (1):** And if someone determined a way to suppress the inhibitor?  
---
&gt; **Peacemaker Officer (2):** Well, then we die or we bow down to our new golem overlords.
---
I mean it’s WvW.  It should be understood that “getting back to a Zerg” could be dangerous and there should certainly be no expectation of “not running into players” or “not being outnumbered.”
---
not even halloween yet and you hit us with the spookiest memory distortion of all time.
---
no, we have too much asura stuff in the game (and fractals) already.
---
HoT nightmare court plot would be nice, we basically don't have any sylvari fractal
---
Entering "I am Evon Gnashblade" into the search box (without quotes) shrinks the display of results, by ignoring the icon size. This effect will persist until you type the phrase into the search box again to toggle it off.
---
pepega
---
There is no such thing as “proper WvW” though. Your definition is your own subjective interpretation of how the game mode should be played
---
"complexity"... What fractal boss is complex again?
---
Like you literally complete all encounters without Dodge if you save your blocks for attacks instead of burning them all (actually i burn them all and i barely Dodge anyway...)
---
Honestly, you don't really need to know much about wiki editing to get started, and you've got the right idea with the copy past; I do that *all* the time. 
---
If you want to start helping out with small stuff, check out this category on the Spanish wiki:

---
It's full of "I used Google translate, please help" and the occasional "was copy pasted direct from the English wiki so there's English text in here". So you definitely do not need to know any wiki editing to help there, and helping out with that category would be a huuuuge help! =D

This is awesome 🙌 thanks for sharing!

The sooner we remember all "DPS mains" are kids/manchildren on powertrips, being allowed to live out an online power fantasy, the better.
---
&gt;We're not running Harriers/Minstrels out of choice; we're running them because we acknowledge them we're inevitably going to be playing with at least one village idiot.
---
I have a theory that the amount of boon duration necessary beyond a certain point is relative to the group skill.  Absolute godtier DPS rotations and mechanical understanding: 0%, can go full DPS and take the bare minimum skills to put out those necessary boons.
---
Your average PUG group: &gt;=100%.  Full on diviner's, harrier's, or minstrels is a requirement to keep buffs on these people.  Sometimes, it's not even possible to put buffs on them as they like to camp out somewhere between where the buff skills' range ends and Narnia.
---
Ehhh... You are supposed to block arts stomp with those instas. You can also stab+prot they shouldn't die.
---
LOL, for some reason, I thought this was a post from the monster hunter subreddit. I kept on looking at that picture, not understanding anything, like, DID THEY ADD SOME NEW SUPPORT MECHANICS TO ICEBORNE, OUTSIDE OF MUSHRO- MANCER AND FRIENDSHIP?
---
Then, 10 mins it dawned on me. Healbrand, is firebrand, alacrigade is renegade with alacrity. I really should get back to gw2.
---
I believe u/da_Anh was able to rip some models out for mobs we simply had no way whatsoever to get a clean screenshot of. You'd have to message him about it though.
---
The fuck does that have to do with liberals? Every liberal I know supports Hong Kong's protests.
---
Warrior, revenant or thief sound like classes that you would enjoy. Also holosmith (engineer elitespec) and soulbeast(ranger elitespec) to extent sound decent choices for playstyle. Personally from these I would recommend warrior or revenant. I used to play dk and warrior back in wotlk. Also if you enjoy all gamemodes, especially warrior will be viable and good in every mode.
---
That’s true that we don’t have a lot of Sylvari related fractals but then again they haven’t been around for quite as long.
---
Haha, I'm literally doing the same right now. 👍🏻
---
This is why I always thank a support player no matter how rough the fractal/dungeon was. I tried a simple heal druid build one time for T1 and T2 fractals and the sheer amount of hate made me vow to myself that I will always thank the support unless they're a jerk about it.
---
It's pretty vague to just list professions in terms of difficulty because all 9 of them have what is basically sub-classes that often completely change the way it's played.
---
For example, Core Warrior is very simplistic and naturally tanky, making it great for beginners. However, Berserker is much squishier than Core Warrior due to it's toughness penalty and lack of condi cleanse and has a much greater reliance on sustained adrenaline gain (meaning you have to constantly be attacking during your Berserk mode), and Spellbreaker is extremely reliant on counterattacking with proper timing, watching for boons that can be stripped, and interrupting foes when possible. Both of the elite specs make Warrior much more difficult than it is at it's core, so I could recommend playing core Warrior if you really want a relaxed and beginner-friendly playstyle.
---
Ranger is another profession that simply becomes more difficult and complex with the addition of an elite spec, while ironically Necromancer actually becomes easier with elite specs.

Check ShortsGaming. Not sure if he’s done anything super recent, but has a ton of Mesmer training videos.

&gt; You don't have to worry about "rotation" in 99% of the content, that's only for raids and high level fractals.
---
I second this. It's also worth noting that having knowledge of your abilities is WAAAAAAAY more important than just going go the aerodrome and slapping the training golem to learn a rotation you found online. Ideally, you shouldn't need 3rd party resources to know what skills do the most damage and how to queue them properly. Also dodging is something you **will** have to do in nearly all fractals, which makes rotations even less important.

1. Condi is considerably harder to play than Power and has a better payoff in terms of raw single target DPS as long as the encounter doesn't have very frequent phases like Samarog's breakbars.
---
2. Condi is generally inferior to power in most Open World situations as most enemies can be bursted down by Power builds while Condi builds need to ramp up. I personally tend to play Power Tempest in Open World due to it's cleave and sustain advantage.
---
3. I never play Dagger offhand and honestly don't know why anyone would. But maybe I'm missing something.

You bite your tongue. Asura are everything.

Ugg I hate this so much in Bounties. There's 3 necros and still Prot is up on the Awakened. &gt;&lt;
---
Oooooh it look so good ❤❤❤❤
---
Still not an answer
---
Oh that analogy actually makes sense! My sincere apologies for my misunderstanding
---
Is the prologue really free with PoF or does it follow the same system as the other episodes with free when you log in while it is the newest one?
---
As a support fan......you are actually right.  
---
Well, there is no better or worse role. All are necessary, what we choose to play is just affitiny with one or another. It is just, most people will go for dps, and so we will see more bad dps players; But yeah, even I who don't fractal as much, I've seen druids that die more than the melle dps, and healers that had like, one "heal" in the entire skillset. Also have seen a LOT of dps with worse damage than healers.... all of that happens.

I’m working on my map currency and finding it all around the world rn lil biotch keeps running away lol.
---
I like how you automatically think the guard has ascended diviners/full legendary armor 150 agony gemmed and ready to go
---
Thread removed: This sub is not LFG.
---
And honestly what most irritates me is that only what, two classes can provide that?  
---
...I hate this stale meta....
---
While this would be cool, it is probably waaaay too late to add something like that... (assuming they've done anything new for the festival at all)
---
I'm now picturing my revenant channeling Legendary Chef Gordon Ramsay while cooking and IDK if that's terrifying or hilarious.
---
It would be nice for us to witness Joko and Thorn's reunion although they'd have to use some phasing technology for Joko and Thorn's jokes in order to not spoil Season 4's events for new players. :)
---
Another figure from Thorn's past that I'd like to see appear on Halloween is his fifth wife, the Elonian beauty [Zola](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Zola), who has quite the temperament and whose father [Bennu](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Seamarshal_Bennu) we've already met in GW2. We already have the Mad King and the Bloody Prince so it'd be high time to add the Temperamental Queen to the unholy trinity so she could flame Thorn to no end in an effort to sabotage his plans due to her neverending hatred of him (even though courtiers believe it's only a [matter of time](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Til_Death_Do_Us_Part...) before the fires of passion light in her ghostly heart).
---
&gt; **Zola:** Very good! I can see why my deranged, good-for-nothing ex-husband has you running around as his little errand monkey.  
---
&gt; **Zola:** Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to head to Kryta.  
---
&gt; **Zola:** If that screwy, delinquent husband of mine is coming back as a mortal, I want to be the first in line to send him right back into Grenth's waiting arms!  
---
&gt; **Emissary of King Thorn of Kryta:** Oh yes, I was expecting the queen to be...surprised by our request. Don't you worry, I'm sure the trip to Kryta will give her time to cool off. Once she sees her beloved husband's regal visage I'm sure it will light the fire of love in her heart once more.
---
My understanding from the announcement was that the prologue is free with PoF no matter when it's purchased.
---
PoF does indeed have raids, I just jumped to HoT and PoF being the same for the sake of brevity.
---
I did mention vision, but I completely forgot about Coalescense; you're right about that.
---
Depends on how much of each mode you do, minimum time for a full set in raids is 6 weeks but that's full clearing each week and you need [provisioner tokens](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Provisioner_Token) from ~4 weeks during that time. 
---
PvP takes 3 seasons minimum but having higher ranks and placing 1st-3rd in monthly tournaments will speed things up too.
---
WvW needs minimum 21 weeks of max skirmish tickets per week (7,880 total).
---
So yes, you can bypass some time gates by doing multiple types but you'd have to put in some crazy amounts of time to cap out more than one time gate really, I'd suggest focusing one the one you want and not trying to gear for WvW/PvE or learn to play 3 different game modes at top tier. My go to suggestion is raids since you also get a free set of ascended and another set of precursors for free and the first set is pretty cheap. Not to mention you then unlock crafting more sets and they all count for the PvE exclusive armor achievement (not to mention the unique transformations).
---
No, that would be a pretty heavy spoiler for every new player that just bought the game (which isn't unlikely, considering the recent DLC changes). What could work are extra instances or extra dialogues for accounts that played through certain episodes but no idea if anet would bother to code such thing 
---
By the way, that\_shaman made a hilarous video about the Mad King and Joko's death ("He's My best enemy"), I think you'll like it :P
---
I guess he tried to make humour by trying to imply that GW2 will never get the third expac but he shouldn't have expected you to understand it as a new player you are.
---
Melee in the face is Warrior class in this game btw. I remember feeling the burst in my faces many times. You can check out some build examples  [here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Warrior) under the conquest title.
---
PvP however is kinda cancerous right now, especially if you are playing solo and a talented player. Makes you feel bad when you play fine but lose the game because of your team.
---
WvW is super fun if you are interested in the fights with big zergs tho. Make sure you chose a good server for WvW.
---
Who did you commission? Its lovely!
---
You guys are awesome! Thank you for doing this. :)
---
Any ranger or minion necro are perfect for that, I'm sure even a gaming journalist could learn to play them with minimal assistance.

Players should not be able to jump over the walls. Do you remember where it was since they could have used a jump pad from one of the desert borderlands shrines.

taco markers?
