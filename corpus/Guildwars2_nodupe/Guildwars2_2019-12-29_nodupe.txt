People have been screaming "maintenance mode" and "Games dead" for about 5 years now, dont listen to them. You have thousands of hours of content, game is alive and well and full of new players. You just have some salty vets who want more specific content who complain.
---
---
---
We're getting another patch with new content coming in at the end of January. The problem for a lot of disgruntled people is that the nature of the content (open world/story content with a new set of achievements) isn't always what they consider to be worthwhile content (repeatable end game difficult content)
---
We're still getting patches every two weeks and new content every month. People who like to raid or people who PvP or WvW are annoyed that their patches are much much fewer and further between but plenty of open world and story patches, the last one was small...but it was just a few weeks ago.
---
It's worth playing with tempered expectations.  I wouldn't expect the game to receive much in the way of competitive PvE or PvP updates; so no new raids, fractals or the fabled WvW "Alliances" update.  
---

---
The game receives anywhere from between 2-4 hours of story content and anywhere from 2-3 weeks to a months worth of open world content every few months.  There's a lot of progression to sink your teeth into.  
---
That said, the game does seem to be doubling down on its casual majority.  Most of the weekly/bi-weekly updates push new gem-store cosmetics and micro-transactions such as exclusive loot-box skins.  After a while the disparity between in-game rewards and monetization leaves people feeling grim.   
---
All in all GW2 is a great game, but it leans towards an increasingly aggressive cosmetic monetization curve.  If you're interested in dungeons (fractals) or (raids) then you would do well to acknowledge that these are declining communities.  The game isn't dead, but it can be difficult to get involved in this context.
---
ArenaNet doesn't really have the same wholesome or earnest appeal anymore.
---
I thought the people there hated every MMO
---
ummmmmm they changed it like months ago
---
Not sure financial status has anything to do with it. I could have Jeff Bezos's wealth and I still wouldn't buy gem store cosmetics because I don't care about that content.
---
It really was. Too many players dismiss that, but 40 minutes of story, combined with hours of map meta content, it was plenty to tide me over until Wintersday.
---
Why does that matter? If you don't want to buy gem store stuff, don't buy gem store stuff. We don't need to know about that.
---
The free to play game is basically the whole core game (game without expansions). It is restricted mostly just to make sure people don't abuse the fact that it is free (for example to prevent people from spamming map chat, you can only do that once you reach a certain level in the free to play version).
---
You will miss out on expansion content and features though, like mounts, gliding, elite specializations (a different way to play a profession), the revenant profession and of course the areas of the expansions.
---
Buying the newest expansions gives you the first one too by the way, so its $30 to get everything and remove the free to play restrictions. (it will still miss living story chapters though).
---
Regarding professions and playing a support type of character. In theory every profession can support/heal others, but some are better at it. For most content it won't matter that much, but if you want to do meta end game things, then you should probably check out websites like [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/) and [discretize](https://discretize.eu/builds) first.  
---
On the other hand if you don't buy the expansions you will most likely not have access to a build (the elite spec) that people want in their group (for meta groups in high level fractals and raids).
---
Overall it is one of the best free to play games at the moment and you will probably have lots of fun before you spend anything. Once you reach level 80 and want access to elite specs etc. you can still make the decision to buy the expansions. You would only miss out on daily login rewards which would be a bit of a shame, but also not a deal breaker.
---
10k of hour here , and i complain , soo what? for sure for a new player there is tons of things to do cos the base game is still amazing , but acting like it's all ok and player who complain are liar is just sad...
---
Open pve didn't have much use for healing. And f2p has severe chat restrictions unless it has changed.
---
Or GW2 Marketing.
---
Every MMO community, hates their respective MMO. It's how we grow closer.
---
Well, it seems like I dug my own grave here, because I sure as hell won't be nominated again after such an ungrateful post... But thanks for everything up to now, I really appreciate it! :)
---
You should be on that list every year for what you've been doing for the wiki, although I understand it's a bit weird nominating oneself... :D
---
It's all good , congratulations .
---
This is the world we live in now. Fans hate the thing they claim to be fans of.
---
MO is gone?
---
What armor pieces are those? Guns look like pact guns but I have no idea what the rest of the outfit is called.   
---
I'm digging the blue-trim on white though.
---
I would wait on how well received the upcoming episode 2 will be on the community.
---
 I its as bad as episode 1 and other game modes dont get any attention as well, i dont have a good feeling recommending this game for a new player anymore.
---
Even tho it would take you quite a while to work through all the backlog and content which is already there and most of it is good...
---
&gt;I've seen Scourges outdpsing even average Mirrages
---
Unless something has changed while I was away, comparing against a mirage only gives usable data if you specifically ask them for their personal reported damage.
---
Note the IP address of the map Pepperseed is bugged on using the "/ip" command in the chat line.  Then look for maps with different IP addresses after a meta event and/or a new patch.
---
This is true. Mirage (and by proxy, condi chrono) shine extremely well in fights like twin largos due to the high attack rate.
---
Scourge, however, shines very well when coupled with other condi classes in long fights. Get multiple condi scourges together for epi bounce and, well... 
---
Condi scourge, while lackluster alone, scales incredibly well with more condi classes, and brings epi, along with other awesome utilities, so its far from useless for sure. But yes, mirage leaves other condi classes in the dust on single target dps due to confusion. Scourge does win in multi target though. Granted, condi scourge is also relatively meh to play - it doesnt have much feedback for your damage skills, so often you dont realize youve done much until suddenly the enemies all simultaneously drop dead.
---
At least your inability to recognize someone with more talent than you is consistent.
---
The fact that they put Aion on the christmas card is pretty bizarre, Aion has been a barren wasteland for quite a while.
---
If reaper is better than dragonhunter/weaver/soulbeast in fractals, why do none of the records run it? Why do none of the records in any group run reaper? Why is it not seen?
---
Also, you're mistaken about the scholar uptime in shroud. If you are below 90% shroud, you will not have scholar. And since you can't get healed by most healers in shroud, you have an almost permanent loss of scholar.
---
I mean, I could literally point to the numbers. By just raw healing alone, heal renegade is the highest healing off healer in the game (taking into account scourge's barrier). Not only that, it brings utility for the group: the most busted cc skills seen, surge of the mists, and darkrazors daring, and Assassin's Presence.
---
I'm sure discretize is very well known for their fractal records. Why don't you point me to one of their fractal CM records? (Their site hasn't been updated for a while.)
---
Honestly, my thoughts exactly
---
What game?
---
I think I'm just going to come back and give it a chance. I still have a bit of nostalgia that will keep my interest till I get used to it. Seems like there's a lot more to this game than it's predecessor.
---
Starting now! Just trying to determine what profession and I'll be set. Was thinking either a warrior or Ele.
---
Odd pose in a void like this but I can see someone making a pose like this in the middle of explosions, incoming fire and other dramatic combat stuff.
---
I don't agree with you sorry bud. When the original game came out it was refreshing and new, and had all of its potential. They axed that potential by abandoning the dungeons team and basically releasing no content whatsoever for years outside of temporary releases in the form of LS. Their HoT expansion was straight up garbage, you can tell that they wanted to do much more with it but just didn't have the time or budget to do everything that they wanted and had to rush it. The PoF one was okay as a first playthrough but offered no replay value and was extremely underwhelming in terms of gameplay. I mean honestly I don't have much of anything positive to mention about this game's raids because they're just so dull and uninteresting to me compared to ones I've seen and tried in other games.
---
It was never alive, the player make it alive when they play.
---
It was:
---
* Core release
---
* S1
---
* S2
---
* Hot
---
* S3
---
* PoF
---
* S4
---
* Ice brood "saga" (S5 but rebranded)
---
Thank you for the feed back.
---
Lower population mean higher impact per individual, which isn't a bad thing in my book.
---
As for mounth, taking a keep seems like a big task for new player in order to have their mounth, but with today's few encounter, I'd say they don'T change much to the gameplay.
---
Diplomacy?  Not when you're making a damn fool decision.  
---
Shit talking while he threw torches into the renegade's tents.  
---
His half-crazed laugh he gives to jeyne after storming the renegade cave.

I mean, if he had a daughter she'd be a lot like Jeyne except smarter, stubborner and better lookin.

The ale house on free curry night comment was epic.

I used to hang there too a long time ago. That website lost me cause of the users who come there. A ton of ignorance and stupidity running rampart.
---
Dolphin is going to foo up your day
---
Wait, you think the PoF raids are dull and uninteresting, but thought dungeons were awesome?  
---
95% of all meta dungeon combat was just “stack in a corner, dps, and power rez each other” while playing one of the two acceptable classes...  How is that choked full of potential but 100 CM, Dhuum CM or Largos twins is dull?  
---
I’m curious tho:  Aside from FF XIV, which is the undeniable king of content right now, what mmo has better raid’s than gw2?  I’d actually love to know cuz I need a new game.  -.-
---
Gz, I'm in the same boat with you - around since launch day +2 and made my first leggy a month ago. Got the itch to make more - I found my endgame content!
---
TIL you can turn that food into gifts. I saw toy weapon skins and the random old wintersday junk (Ugly Wool Socks, etc.) and thought that was it.
---
give me MORE then you can transform into a snowman LOL
---
What are the other pieces?
---
Tenebrous revolvers, kodan boots and gloves, magitek leggings
---
That's not even what I'm saying though. Someone on the article said they'd failed to deliver on the combat system, BECAUSE it was not the action style combat they'd expected. Which couldn't be further from the truth if you ask me. Like I said, the only way they could take it further is by making you aim your ranged skills.
---
Minus the living world seasons.
---
Not even signed.... that's so sad
---
For the North hemisphere.
---
Just play the game really.  You'll see people doing the things you love and as you see them more and more, ask to join.
---
And this kind of Anet bootlicking is exactly why we are where we are today - with a game that's gasping its last rattling breaths before it gets taken offline due to mismanagement leading the company into inevitable bankruptcy.
---
Hmmmm nice teeth
---
Shield is most commonly used for chronomancer and healbrand (for projectiles). In pvp/wvw you will probably see some warriors and engineers run shield. I guess the closest to what you want to run is some condi berserker build with a bow+sword/shield, but it's not at all meta.
---
It's not even necessarily that, but seeing the gem-store consistently get better, more high quality skins than those released within the game as a natural pursuit via collections or achievements *hurts.*  It makes me feel undervalued and underappreciated.  I think for a lot of us legendaries aren't particularly special anymore, what is special is something accompanied by a story, journey or memory, and lately, there is no story, there is no memory or journey.  There's just the cash shop.
---
I made the same ass joke like two weeks ago and got flamed into obscurity.
---
This fucking community.
---
shield is generally a defensive weapon.  in raids you don't need defense. Chrono is the only commonly used shield class for raids, though i've seen heal FBs carry shield for sloth.   
---
In almost all cases, tanky classes are not necessary in gw2. There a very small set of exceptions to this (some raids have mechanics that need a tank, like Deimos). Most durability in PVP is due to dodges, evades, and heals rather than many tanky stats. WvW your commanders are tanky, but very  few other ppl in the group need to be tanky.
---
SMH my head
---
In PvE content, pure offense is what shines, considering the amount of damage you can negate just by dodging. As others have said, Chrono is King when it comes to using shield in PvE content for the alacrity and aegis it provides, same goes for Healing Firebrand's shield. You may also see Holosmiths running around with Sword and Shield in non-instanced content. There is a nice build for that playstyle you can see [here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith_-_Protection_Sword/Shield). 
---
Shield is a lot more widely used in PvP and WvW. You'll find Spellbreaker Warriors running x/shield for one of their weapons a lot of the time because of how useful the stun and projectile block (reflect when traited) is. A great tool for building adrenaline in big fights. You'll also see Heal Scrappers likely running Pistol/Shield as an alternate to hammer. Heal Firebrand also performs incredibly well here, and shield is a staple for it's role. On the other hand, Chrono is very mediocre when it comes to PvP game modes. 
---
I don't see many heralds running shield in either game mode.
---
I hope that helps!
---
I'm about 99.999% sure it's called "Presentable Liberty".

The instances aren't the only part of the story, and the story isn't the only part of the Whispers update. I took about an hour and a half to two hours to complete the story, and then spent several more hours playing the meta, farming mats for the new high-capacity bags and the weapon set.  It was more than enough to carry me over to the Wintersday content. At some point I might even try the Strike missions.

Everyone everywhere hates GW2
---
What the fuck has that to do with experience?

Game has been in maintenance mode for nearly 3 years now and all they add are story. The newest game system is just another damn set of story missions on top of the main content only being story.
---
&amp;#x200B;

It's sickening and a joke. DO NOT play this game unless you want to play a single player story driven MMO for w/e reason.

I thought this was some weird photoshop for a second but saw the links and it is legit.

Shills are posting them to bury the more important discussions about the state of the game.
---
Watching this game die is like watching a friend slowly fade away. Really makes you realise that nothing lasts forever.

Such as?

How are all the art on topic then? Hypocracy imo...
---
Not at all
---
&gt; favoritism towards the Mesmer
---
\*cries in butchered Chrono*
---
What does that have to do with the state of the game?
---
Cool. Hope it's fun.
---
Its issue is that it isn't optimized to take advantage of high end GPUs, so it doesn't run great on insane PCs, but also doesn't run horrible on potatoes. If it is moving to console though, part of that might involve rebuilding the engine to be more efficient, which would benefit both console and PC.
---
I'm looking at real life quaggans in a repost in a repost in a repost in a repost.  Nice thread.
---
Anyone looking for "a signal to stop spending money on the gem store" already wasn't spending money on the gem store.
---
I see nothing there worth discussing 
---
Game companies working on new games is nothing new. You can trip balls all you want about a “console”
---
Game when in reality all modern games are “console games” with that so happen to be on PC as well either better controls and graphics.
---
And for them trying to branch out and try something new.
---
Next gen is just around the corner and that can be a very lucrative market for them to
---
Porpoise, I think?
---
Me and several guild mates finished EVERYTHING there was to do within first 2 days. Including non-timegated achievements.
---
You really should stop defending a company that clearly is only after your money. They are not your family or friends. They exist to take your money and if customer is dissatisfied they have to change. Whiteknights are part of the problem.
---
GW2's stat scaling (not level scaling - the compounding nature of the stats) is a farcical travesty, and the buff system creates all sorts of balance problems, such as the nonsense of Perma-fury, Alacrity, Quickness, and 25Might that cripples build diversity and content comps. 
---
Guild Wars 2's core combat concepts have a solid foundation that really stands out in PvP (or at least used to), but the game's systems in group PvE turn it into a shitty WoW-style rotations done far worse.
---
Exactly.
---
(A few months back when they were announcing Icebrood Saga, the NCSoft marketing guy spent almost half the presentation pushing merchandise like yoga pants and Funko pops. 
---
Based on the fact that they had rented out a fancy venue, we the players had expected most of the presentation to be something related to the state of the game. Turned out to be the exact direction we were headed in. Gem store is the new GW2.)
---
What's wrong with them working on a second game? Was Red Dead Redemption Rockstar giving GTA fans the middle finger?
---
just report the posts so the dupes can get nuked by the mods.
---
So? The stage presentation was a mess, they didn't have enough content ready to promote to justify putting on a show like that, but it doesn't mean anything about the future of the game itself. There's no harm in them making funko pops, if you don't want them, don't buy them. It's not like these take resources away from the game, all they do is sign a contract with Funko and collect money that they can use to make the game better.
---
&gt;Me and several guild mates finished EVERYTHING there was to do within first 2 days. Including non-timegated achievements.
---
Ok? 
---
What does that have to do with me?
---
&gt;You really should stop defending a company that clearly is only after your money. 
---
Every company is after my money. If that bothered me I'd move to a mountain and eat grubs. All I care about with ANet is that they provide me a game that I enjoy playing, and so far they've been doing that just fine.
---
right you are sir &gt;\_&gt; i think he didn't take that into account :P
---
Objective fact is that recent release was underwhelming with lack of things to do. 
---
Sure if you are into afking on top of a tower and watching blizzard and get a hard on for that, then good for u, still doesnt make game that much more enjoyable or playable for majority.
---
Oddly enough, reaper is actually one of the least consistent DPS since it doesnt cap crit in its main DPS set-up for around 50% of a fight. Outside shroud, a GS2 might hit for 10k or 40k, causing pretty wide fluctuations on a fight by fight basis.
---
Also, with regard to heal scourge, youre right in that it has no meaningful buffs and it does pump out pretty decent barrier, but the raw healing it does it fairly poor. It has pretty much 2 raw healing skills, transfuse and the well--you can regen too, but so can every other healer, and it doesnt stack. If any significant damage doesnt get soaked by barrier, it isnt easily healed up. This means that eventually, and ironically, a heal necro will lose to attrition. It does have the interesting mechanic of being the best resser (though the new mesmer buffs may contest it), though as you mentioned, that isnt a meaningful mechanic--as if you dont get to actually make use of it if your group is playing well.
---
I'm not really into pokemons.
---
you can checkout "  [https://discord.gg/hB73zQh](https://discord.gg/hB73zQh)  "  this is mainly a trading guild, but they also organize the ls4 meta train daily for eu and na  (it is the most efficient way of farming gold)
---
Because condi scourge isnt a spec, epidemic with condi gear is the entirety of any condi necro build. People dont bring condi necro for their DPS, they bring it for epidemic mechanics like adds and such. Hell, even if you bring multiple necros to epi-bounce, due to the low base damage of the class/spec, youre likely better off just bringing an OP firebrand, who has something like 7k+ higher base DPS and doesnt need to use anyone to set up a DPS spike for him like an epi-bouncer. If epidemic was removed from the necro kit, condi necro (any spec/build) would not exist.
---
Patch was about 19:00. I was done with **all** non timegated achievements at 2:00
---
So far to content till wintersday
---
&gt;Objective fact is that recent release was underwhelming with lack of things to do. 
---
I won't get into semantics about the misuse of the term "objective" in this case, but there was less content to the most recent release than in some previous ones. Whether that's a trend that will continue indefinitely is something we won't know for another few releases. 
---
&gt;Sure if you are into afking on top of a tower and watching blizzard and get a hard on for that, then good for u, still doesnt make game that much more enjoyable or playable for majority.
---
It's at least better than another raid instance, objectively speaking.

&gt;Patch was about 19:00. I was done with all non timegated achievements at 2:00

12on7 uses Windows 7 kernel exports and is locked to function on 7 only, the DirectX team have obstinately taken the position that windows 8.x users do not matter despite still existing, and having legitimate reasons for not using the Windows 10 experiment.
---
uh no? even in duo/trio dungeons condi is super bad because fights are still bursty and short
---
as usual, condi fb is an exception! but this is about necro and no way you can dps race any power build..by the time you finish a scepter auto chaim the dungeon is already over
---
He's not. They're all good.
---
1640 hours since last april (so a year and a half-ish.)
---
Haha, I imagine so. Really 7 was more than enough for me.
---
Because tybalt is cute and has apples and most people don't pay attention to the story. 
---
Forgal is the real deal.
---
Anet partner here, I got exactly the same card.
---
I've still got my 2015-18 ones somewhere, but was kinda sad there's no signatures and it's NCSoft, not GW2.
---
Just logged in again after a year to find chrono was neutered. Feels really bad as a mesmer main to have your class completely gutted.
---
servers are only important for wvw &gt;\_&gt; if you've been here since release how come you missed the point when megaservers where introduced?
---
well gw2 is not a game for raiders to begin with, expansions or not
---
If ANet weren't so intent on shitting up an IP with every single decision for five years running, the game wouldn't be in this mess. MO spending all that time and money on side projects which went nowhere? = Fuck you, this is an NCSOFT project now and you lot get to deal with with that.

There's something in the water.

What settings do you run?

so what you trying to do then?
---
I remembering that being a Korean MMO with a Z axis.
---
what is your ram and do you have other programs running same same with gw2. what kind of processor are you running. It’s becoz your story sounds like you bottleneck at some point.
---
It's all about presentation
---
I have to say if you're looking for a game with endgame/Raids but can't afford to spend 30&amp; on it, don't know if you will be able to find one
---
That's awesome and congratulations. I've been playing the game off and on since release and I still haven't made one and am too poor in game to buy one.
---
I think the top comment is likely closer to the truth. Gaile&amp;mdash;or another veteran that has left&amp;mdash;probably conceived the Christmas card project and made it happen each year. And although they left nearly a year ago, we're only feeling this aspect of their departure now.
---
This isn't as much a canary in the coal mine as it is a canary in the aviary. We're sad that it's gone, but I don't think there's value in reading more into it.
---
It's worth it because there's a lot to do for someone that hasn't really sank their time into it already. Most of the complaints and grumbling come from grizzled vets who have seen this movie too many times to be happy. Newcomers and those returning after only playing a little bit tend to have a blast.
---
Accenting on ONLY the positive side of anything in general is a disservice to the reader, white knight...
---
No it's a dead game /s
---
It's waaaay better and cheaper to just craft one than buy one anyways.
---
Winter in November ?
---
Core only? Because if we include HoT and especially PoF, I feel Balthazars end deserves a spot as "best badass lines ever" as well! Although I'm biased, because its my favorite most badass line in the game \^-\^
---
Balthi: **I AM FIRE, I AM WAR! WHAT ARE YOU?**  
---
Player: *Still standing.*
---
Yes, every PoF license includes HoT
---
This cannot be said enough. Don’t buy from sites like g2a. There have been so many bans in the past (already since launch of GW2 core!).
---
What was it that made you strike it as not objective? Was it the mention of the word "personal" in the very first sentence?
---
The cycle continues.
---
Management is unnecessary and a waste of resources.
---
It's especially sad when you consider how people who 'manage' developers typically get paid more than developers.
---
There are a lot labours of love with a game and company like this. Things that don't *need* to get done, but someone does it because it's their personal passion project. We saw this reach the game in all kinds of random ways especially in the two years, but we still hear ANet talk of new ones from time to time. Super Adventure Box is a prominent early example.
---
If the Christmas card project was somebody's "baby", and I think it's safe to say it was, then it makes sense that the project died with them. It's not like no cards went out at all, but the person who cared about making this awesome is likely gone.
---
I don't think it's fair to extrapolate this to "nobody gives a shit about the playerbase"
---
what ranking do you play in?
---
You don't have to explain obvious stuff, yes there are much better specs in this game. My point was, that even scourge on most bosses can do reasonable DPS when played properly.
---
I'm not talking about minmaxing and pushing to the limit, when you speedrunning with your static etc. In a regular pug group you can do pretty well.
---
BONUS: I'm not even saying (well I do actually) that GW2 raiding overall is a joke, difficulty wise. Killing boss in pug 30-60sec sooner or later won't make any difference.
---
*Lol, you can even do full raid clear with scourges as a dps only and have no problem whatsoever.*
---
If the problem is random disconects during private instances (such a story steps) try using a VPN. This game's connection to the instances is extremely sensible to some ISP QoS policies, which stop applying using a vpn.
---
Tybalt is the goofiest and experiences the greatest growth. Seiran just prances around chaotically until suddenly, hey, suddenly she feels she needs to sacrifice herself to feel responsible. Forgal was sort of always a begrudging badass who already reached his apex and his only arc, his beef with you, comes to terms with you after the first mission.
---
Also, apples, and I'm not just kidding. No other mentor had a similarly iconic meme.
---
Touchè. Point taken.
---
GW2 is a buy to play game and always was. The f2p version is more of a extended trial in which you get the full core game were you can level to 80 which is the level cap and then there are some lvl 80 content to play around. There are no time restrictions so you can stick around in the core game for as long as you wish. In the end the expansions would be something you want to have since this is were all the stuff happens. 
---
The core game is something we all show up in due to events, gathering nodes, festivals, leveling and so on, so you will find people to play with. The Silver Waste map for example at lvl 80 is still the most gold profit map to play in.

Just jump in and start level, it goes pretty fast if you set your self up too it. Maybe watch a guide on how to level so you dont get tunnel visions on hearts :)
---
Id have to disagree and say its combat system, while not perfect, is leaps and bounds better than any other currently available.  
---
It has the perfect level of intricacy mixed with an approach ability some other games have struggled with.  For what the game is and how its supposoed to be easily accessible, it accomplishes an engaging but not overly complicated combat.
---
Having to now add aiming, which is some cases you do, or having to take into account a 3rd axis during combat, which occasionally happens anyways, would make it a steep learning curve for new players and the gap between vet and newbie even greater.

&gt; Now that doesn't mean you can't run an extremely tanky build, you can probably get away with a super tanky character in open world, though it honestly just means that you'll take longer to kill the content than everyone else.
---
I ran a scrapper like that. Eventually I had to start doing might stacking just to speed things up. Thing is I only had a minor reduction in sustainability so all that beef was a waste to begin with.

Not all forms of applciable revealed are AoEs or PBAoEs, but some are:
---
* Light's Judgement. 
---
* Sight Beyond Sight
---
* Detection Pulse 
---
* Tainted Shackles
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Revealed
---
If you are close enough, you'll get Revealed.
---
If you are losing stealth without getting Revealed, then that's either a bug or cheating. But if you are getting Revealed, it's likely on of those area effects.
---
"Nothing Can Save You!" should definitely also get AoE revealed.
---
OooOOOooooOOooo, nice shell.

Quaggan likes you!

It depends what you want to do, if you want to roam and flip camps then marauders longbow works really well. But if you want to play in blobs then roll another class
---
That is impressive! 
---
Also your character armorset looks nice too, is there an in-game comparison anywhere?

Anyone who plays all professions more or less equally will be able to tell you they do not really play favorites.
---
Everyone goes through the chopping block sooner or later. Just not at the same time. So everyone has ups and downs.
---
Every time there's skill balance, some of those who favor a single or a couple of professions will think the sky is falling and they've got it worse than the rest.
---
Changes are coming, and some of the most gimmicky one-trick-pony mesmer builds will be hit hard, same for other professions. But then the dust will settle and people will figure out more builds, and the process begins again.
---
Isn't that game full of microtransactions without content updates nowadays? It used to be a fun game, if you got used to the lag. But it was also more grindy the more you got to the end game.
---
Fun fact: Me and a couple of my IRL friends got to know a person there that wanted to try GW2. We looked it up and decided to buy it. This was during the first Halloween in 2012. Sadly I'm the only one still playing GW2, although barely.
---
Are people that fast nowdays? I'm nearing 6k h and still don't have close to the level of salt that people in the sub usually throw around.^^
---
Sure dude, keep saying that to yourself. There must be always someone with lack of faith, that character is even featured in most of the movies. Usually their beliefs are proved to be based on nothing but their own delusional perception :D
---
TBH this sounds like either an issue with your computer's power supply or overheating. In both instances if something(GW2 per say, because GW2 is CPU intensive and draws a lot from the power supply which can generate a lot of heat) maxes them out, there are built in safety features that cause the PC to reset itself to prevent permanent damage.
---
This is why you never skimp and buy cheap power supplies and why you always ensure there is good air flow and cooling in your system. Overheating and Bad Power Supplies kill more systems than just about anything else period.
---
Uh yes? As you yourself said it's a burst fight, you don't burst with an auto chain, you burst by dropping bigger shit. And necro has plenty of good aoes that melts ads.
---
But by all means it's still shit compaired to power, but still usefull.

Teams need leaders and organizers - especially in projects as complicated as game development. Trying to coordinate anything without somebody to make sure everyone is on the same page and they're working in sync with other parts of the team would be insanely difficult.
---
But *bad* management? Bad management micromanages, it doesn't keep things in sync, and while in a disorganized development environment individual devs may have different conflicting visions for the game, the vision of bad management is almost *guaranteed* to be holistically bad. At least in the other case, there's a chance that things will work out.
---
Bad management is worse than no management.
---
Congratz! You have analysed what an MMO with multiple gamemodes is
---
You're getting downvoted because you are fundamentally misunderstanding that a person must be focused on a single thing and cannot both appreciate how they are cute and like something from a game and be concerned about it being endangered.  There is no "opposed to" in this situation.
---
I asked questions. Want more interaction? Answer them. Otherwise I'm bored of playing "No U" with your ass. Until, lil' babboo; Peace.
---
I really like the terrace, even though I have the more useful Armistice Bastion pass.
---
But I got the terrace [for free](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Commemorative_Sprocket) back when we got those season 1 boxes. I don't think I would have spent money on it.
---
For some unfortunate countries, yes. Also maps tend to last around 3 months since release lately.
---
I did think of that, but majority of the players is concentrated on EU and NA.
---
&gt; Open worlders **cry about** others being toxic and **their gamemodes ruined by people in wvw who like to blob**

That's a new one.

I don't have to answer shit, but here we go anyway... 
---
Background looks like you randomly sprinkled in transparent "snow" which is too large and has no depth, the large flakes should be less transparent to indicate focus and depth, the smaller should be more transparent to give an out-of-focus look and depth.
---
The ice jutting from the ground shows no sort of 3d space. You just sprinkled the shit in there, because laziness?
---
Mesmers cant dual wield so this is weird.
---
The mesmers head is also rotated too far, That's a neck sprain right there.
---
The mesmer has rocket boots? It would of made more sense if it was an engineer.
---
The weeb comment comes from this being a very Anime style fight scene. Dagger dragging against the ground? Fucking weeb shit.
---
Are they ice skating? On a tiled floor?
---
The floor is also a hill? the perspective is off. Especially since there is no horizon, its just a gradient which you tried to cover with your shitty "snow"
---
LASER SWORDS, why? Too lazy to draw any amount of detail?
---
I hope you try harder at your "PrOFeSsIoNaL IlLuStRatOr" gig.
---
There are rules in pvp/activity that multiboxing is not allowed there, but what if I play on 2 diff pcs, with 2 diff accounts, can I do the activity(like keg brawl) achis myself then?
---
Personality-wise, I found Tybalt to be one of the more engaging personalities. Throw on his tragic story, and you have a recipe for sadness.

Thanks for sharing such a lovely video! It's a fun selection of many holiday favorites, and you all played them well with beautiful arrangements; I particularly liked the Feliz Navidad and Angels We Heard on High performances.
---
It's always nice to see people spreading musical cheer throughout Tyria. Keep up the good work, and keep on rockin'! :)
---
so tell us what negative impact gw2 had on the mmo genre or the gaming industry.
---
Oh no, the revenants have been corrupted by &gt;!Jormag!&lt;
---
&gt; And what makes this a "true MMO experience"? 
---
Call it traditional, then. I've given a few examples where people, cross games, either invested heavily in or examples that straight up don't exist in other genres, like an economy.
---
&gt; Who made you the arbiter of what an MMO experience is or isn't? Do the hundreds of thousands of other players who play for other reasons not play "true MMO experiences" because it's not the content you like?
---
The unique selling point of MMOs is a connected, player driven world with meaning and value to your actions, where doing an activity in one gamemode can impact another. If people only played GW2 for the story, have they actually played an MMO then? Where's the difference to any other single player game? IMO, there isn't, and they haven't experienced an MMO. 
---
&gt; Whats more "true MMO experience" about a 5 person dungeon over a 100+ person huge open world event?
---
Almost nothing, both are mostly run to farm currency. But looking at the meta events of GW2, player interaction is almost non-existant, with the majority either waiting afk or doing the bare minimum spamming autoattacks. Dungeons require more interactions.
---
5oO °/o bEtAmInEd
---
This is well done. Looks quite balanced on the paper at the fist look.
---
why am I crying..
---
So what is the impact?
---
GW2 is great for new player  , there are lot of content to enjoy BUT there is no endgame at all compared to many mmo.
---
That was a lot of work.
---
D/p is still okayish just not great due to daredevil changes and the lower damage of dagger now. 
---
Could try d/d core but it's a one trick pony.
---
It's a simple choice for me - I refuse to support (with my wallet) the direction this game has gone.
---
Great to see some positivity, and o totally agree with all they said. Game has had a lot of bumps but it’s still fantastic and I’m not going anywhere
---
Me too lol, will be interesting to see ice maps in the summer as Icebrood progresses
---
Anets lack of proper communication with the community i think
---
Same. Similarly, I refuse to allow Anet the slightest chance at good PR until they either fix the game or reigns of the game is given to someone else.
---
Desert was amazing. Still is  favorite roaming map.
---
I am one of those people that slowly phased out of the game after Icebrood Saga was announced, you know, from daily login to once a week to once a month to currently never.
---
For me, more than the excruciatingly slow pace in which they release raids, fractals or anything WvW related and the very weak balancing until the moment I quit, it was the fact they completely forego of new elite specs. I didn't even know I wanted new elite specs so bad until I saw there weren't coming anytime soon.
---
And now I understand why, elite specs allow you to play older content in a brand new fashion. 
---
I agree with many when they say this an amazing game with wasted potential written all over it and it's imo closer and closer reaching point of no return.
---
Playing multiple accounts at once is still multiboxing, regardless of whether you're doing it on one PC or multiple.
---
[The rules say that](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013658134-Policy-Dual-or-Multi-Boxing) "You are not permitted to run multiple accounts simultaneously in PvP*, WvW, activities, or in other competitive environments." -- presumably activities fall under that last category, so multiboxing in them could lead to your account being actioned.
---
You could try to make the argument as so long as no one else is in the activity, it's not competitive as there are no other players around... But that's a pretty hair-splitting argument and I don't think support would be persuaded by it.
---
Would they even be able to turn their focus towards the less profitable avenues like Raids/PvP/WvW at this point? Wouldn't they lose money until they regrow their veteran audiences again, which would take how long?
---

Nice post. I appreciate your attempt to encourage a more welcoming environment for new players. I very much suspect it will fall on completely deaf ears, except for those who already understand such social dynamics. But maybe your post will inspire some of the already understanding to counter the intense unhappiness of some with welcoming enthusiasm for the new folks. Of course, they’ll just be called white knights and downvoted, but so it goes. That’s Reddit. 
---
How are the official forums. I don’t go there. Same situation? Same tone?
---
You want a game with harder content than any raid in Guild Wars 2?
---
You want a game where after 10,000 hours you can still learn something new every day?
---
You want a game that has millions of players and will never enter maintenance mode?
---
You want a game with almost unlimited amounts of content?
---
You want a game that lets you communicate with intelligent players and make you grow as a person?
---
I am glad that I finally found that game. 
---
I am learning Chinese now.
---
What specific things do you think ArenaNet could do to turn it around?
---
Similar tone, but way less cynical and negative, at least on general discussion (the biggest board).
---
WvW polls were the most public example of that. They were bad and not designed to elicit meaningful feedback.
---
WvW reset night change (from Friday to Saturday evening) was the strongest example of ANet simply disregarding overwhelming community feedback. Nobody wanted it, everybody correctly diagnosed how it would crush WvW participation and existing groups, and ANet barrelled on ahead anyway.
---
Golem week is the highest profile example of absolute tone-deafness. They even said that it was done without thought or consideration for gameplay.
---
I'm not even addressing plain old bugs and unusable wvw content that they shipped at HoT launch. Defects happen and they did address them over time.
---
Simple follow season 4 with an expansion.
---
The saga has not the features i wanted.
---
I've quit this game after a long time playing. I still play GW1 sometimes, but not 2. This is after a good stint with raiding, fractals, WvW, all the stories and LW seasons, and a pretty solid run in PvP with top 250 and some tournaments.  
---
It just feels like everything they do is misguided *and* not enough. I understand that casuals will always come first, but you shouldn't focus on only casuals, you need to make that gameplay loop for hardcore players and facilitate transition from casual to regular to hardcore. In some instances this is very easy. Swiss tournaments for SPvP, balance changes from someone who actually plays the gamemode, a quick-- even messy-- GvG mode, WvW rebalancing and changes by someone who actually plays that, and a commitment to at least put a raid wing out once in a while-- especially with harder modes for replay. That's more or less all that needs to happen on the hardcore side of things to keep and bring back players in that scene.
---
GW2 has one of the best combat systems out there right now but it's not fun for most players to beat up a virtual punching bag over and over for several years. Hook them with the combat, lead that into story content, strikes, fractals, raids-- or conversely combat, story, WvW, GvG, SPvP. Make a decent progression from starter to hardcore player, and make that hardcore loop feel fun and rewarding.
---
I don't even enjoy logging in anymore. I was really optimistic about a build system, but they fucked that so royally I lost what little faith I had left
---
Oh well, no game lasts forever. Gw2 had a pretty good run for me
---
Christ..
---
I'll be honest. I was expecting: \[&amp;AgHcMABAVQsBAA==\]
---
I understand and feel your frustration. It's just hard for me to give into cynicism because I love Guild Wars so much.
---
drop what? you gotta cast 3 shades, then you bip into f5, maybe torch..your condis will tick for like 2s before the fight is over
---
it's really not useful it's insanely bad especially scourge cuz it has huge ramp time
---
a bursty condi like fb does fine, hell even mirage probably performs better
---
dont think open world pve players to be a bulk of the games population , you just see people from other gamemodes in it form time to time
---
Actually I'd Argue Templates, Strike Missions, Ascended Cooking (with a huge quest associate), and Dynamic UI are at least expansion-level features. We also got Blue Masteries, instead of piggybacking off PoF.
---
"But templates are monetized the hell out of it!"   So are gliders and mounts.
---
"But we didn't get any raid!"  when have we ever gotten a raid with an expansion? Spirit Vale wasn't even released for a few weeks until after HoT. 
---
Now, I'm with everyone else when I say we want, and we NEED new elite specs. 
---
But to say we got "jackshit" isn't giving them any credit where credit is due.
---
Let's see if ArenaNet can deliver the rest of the expansion throughout Icebrood Saga. If so, I will be happy. If not, then we can make the ded gaem posts.
---
Support is normal (great for some people) to deal with easy tasks, when it comes to real issues they're just shit
---
I think you're right, sadly enough.
---
Arenanet has never been willing to truly invest into gw2.thats what's killing this game..so it's no surprise the community no longer wants to invest into it either.
---
This is just unacceptable.
---
Its not like players haven't been vocal about what they want literally for years.  Anet's communication and failure to realize what the players want is 100% on them.  As a customer, you can only do so much before you move on even if you wholeheartedly love a product.
---
I think its pretty obvious if you take even 30 minutes out of a day to read the forums, this sub, or play in-game that people aren't happy with the way things are going.  Sure maybe that one person who logs in a few times a year might be happy but why cater or even really care what that person thinks?  They aren't loyal to the company, game, or probably even talking about it with their friends.  Its the truth...maybe a little harsh but its true.  Even if a hardcore player doesn't spend as much as a whale, the fact that they still play and talk about the game draws more attention to it and in turn makes Anet money.  Its not as direct or maybe even as much as a whale might spend but its still money.
---
We are so far into this hole now that I don't think anything but an expansion would bring people back.  That expansion would have to also be LOADED with features....not new PvE open world maps.  Elite specs, 1-2 strike missions, a raid wing, 1-2 new fractals, WvW rework + alliances, some kind of guild content, a new PvP map, and a balance patch right before its all launched.  That kind of loaded.  Its not going to happen though.  Living story and lore about Charr is all you can really expect anymore.
---
Come on bro. The community is not at fault. ArenaNet needs to improve Guild Wars 2. They could have made sweeping and bold changes to make the game interesting and instead they’ve gone down the content route.
---
The game will decline. It’s been out since 2012 and many people are waiting for a true Guild Wars successor.
---
Very well thought-out and, as a veteran and fan of WvW, I grudgingly agree with several of your points.  The only statement I really had a counter-argument to was :
---
&gt;And in GW2's specific case, the constant negativity from people who fail to recognize that their demographic is just not a profitable market demographic for ArenaNet WILL become a self-fulfilling prophecy of death for what remains of the GW2 community. Market forces have shown in the example of Wildstar that a hardcore fanbase won't sustain a game on its own.
---
If Veterans have so much power to create a sulf-fulfilling prophecy, that makes them a really important demographic and therefore a target demographic even if they aren't the most profitable one (the latter being arguable).  New players have so many new skins free in-game that it is veterans who invest money to keep up with the "Fashion Wars" alone.
---
I also think that veterans are the ones who splurge the most in the cash shop, but I can only guess based on my own buying habits and my friends/peers....well until recently. I have stopped spending money in the cash shop as regularly as I used to once it became apparent that they would always cater to PvErs. **So if anything is a self-fulfilling prophecy, it's Anet's apparent decision that veterans are not a target demographic.**  If they treat us as not important, we will certainly respond in kind with our wallets.
---
Where is that location in the picture?
---
From the title, it's clear this is a discussion post about a complicated set of issues. Not sure what to tell you if 5 sentences is too much for you to read to get involved in the discussion.
---
Well 28th December any business most likely not on full capacity. Maybe after holidays support can escalate those.
---
Anet considers this expansion level content. Stories, new zones, masteries, things like Sun's Refuge, strikes, etc. They consider that stuff "expansion level content".
---
And to an extent, it kinda is. Sure, the only thing missing, elites, is the bulk of what we care about, and is effectively the only thing the community considers expansion content, but how different is season 4 and 5 from PoF, aside from the amount of content released in a single day?
---
Can't judge with only one episode to be fair. The next couple episodes gonna tell how it gonna be.
---
I'm running monitoring software whenever it's up, nothing is reaching high temps. I assumed it was also an overheat issue at first.
---
Addressing the individual praise points:
---
&gt; Templates
---
Is an expansion-level feature. Implemented pretty well in some peoples' eyes, completely half-assed in others' eyes.
---
&gt; Strike Missions
---
Is an expansion-level feature, but they suck.
---
&gt; Ascended Cooking (with a huge quest associate)
---
Is an expansion-level feature. Pretty fair.
---
&gt; Dynamic UI
---
Is not expansion-level; it's hardly an update. The implementation is quite rudimentary.
---
&gt;Blue Masteries
---
Which are currently sub-Koda's Flame-tier useless or super lame
---
&gt; Spirit Vale wasn't even released for a few weeks until after HoT.
---
To be fair, it was originally supposed to release with Heart of Thorns.
---
&gt; But to say we got "jackshit" isn't giving them any credit where credit is due.
---
We got jack shit
---
Well, this appeared to work last night, and I was able to get through the personal story quests but crashed again today. Thanks for your help though.
---
I can partially understand the people, who doesn't like the current state. But for me GW2 is still the best MMO. Things why I don't play too often usually lie somewhere in the real life and not in the game. I'm hoping to spend more time playing this holidays.
---
I'll give the RAM thing a try, the other two I don't have any addons for the game. Thanks for your help.
---
I'm with you in terms of expectations for an expansion. More than anything, I want an expansion with new elite specs. I feel like they could do so much to integrate the Tengu story into a new expansion into Cantha. Part of me is holding on to hope that they will capitalize on the idea and make it a reality because I know hands down it would re-vitalize the game.
---
I agree 100%. 
---
Looking at the comments on this article made me wonder if they'd actually played the game at all. Especially that specific comment.
---
&gt; This is a call for people in this sub and in online GW2 communities to recognize that they have the power to influence the development of the game.
---
We don't, otherwise non singleplayer content would be more supported. 
---
[Proof](https://i.imgur.com/zLCOESF.png)
---
2018 and 2019 brought us:
---
* 2 raids and 2 fractals for group content
---
* 1 pvp map and a controversial wvw mount for competitive content
---
* That's it, lol
---
pvp in 2019 ¯\\\_( ツ )\_/¯
---
I can try running the game in Windows 7 compatibility mode, I'll try that. Thanks for your help.
---
Second suggestion of a VPN, I'll try that if a few other methods haven't worked. Thank you.
---
I'm not saying this is the community's fault, I'm saying lets work together to keep a level head and not destroy the community before ArenaNet can do anything to address the problems. The problems with GW2 are 100% Anet's fault via negligence or lack of communication.
---
How can I talk about things like WvW balance? Because I've been playing the series since Factions and only very recently quit. Despite quitting I still read this subreddit (obviously) and also keep up with Naru, Jebro, Mighty Teapot, and Wooden Potatoes since I'm still invested in the series and would like to see improvements and return.
---
I wouldn't really say I'm a typical hater? I tend to be constructive in my complaints and still support anyone that chooses to play the game. I still recommend the game to many people when it seems like a game they'd enjoy, and I tend to keep complaints to threads like this and similar company to not turn off potential players. I understand fully that new players will never see these issues inside of a year, and many casual players won't see them at all. 
---
I do play other MMOs, I'm sorta notorious among friends for playing just about every MMO (and fighting game). I'm very active in FF14 right now, and also putting good hours into Destiny 2 and PoE-- which are not MMOs, but are frequently lumped in. I've capped out on most MMOs though including DAoC, SWG, BDO, WoW, ESO, etc etc. I'm not saying other games are perfect, it's just that most other good MMOs at least have some degree of focus and that shows. 
---
I can't really say what was going on when Mike was there since I don't work at ANet. Most of what we've heard has been hearsay and not too detailed. I will say, however, that ANet absolutely needs to make another game or else they'll be bankrupt in a couple years. The good news is it appears they're working on something new now, so hopefully that is a financial success, and hopefully that skims off some less interested devs on GW2.  
---
Overall my complaints aren't just saying the game is bad, it just has direction issues. It feels like the devs are constantly pulled in 20 directions and they never get to finish anything they're working on. Instead of just putting off a gamemode or two temporarily to do a meaningful change to a mode, they release a half dozen poorly received changes for different modes and every single facet of the community complains at their lackluster changes.
---
If anything they should focus more on stuff outside living world in 2020. they basicly only did open world in 2019 except for 1 raid and the warclaw.  
---
If you expect more open world you should probably play another game because you're not gonna get more open world than this year. not because they don't want to, but because they went all out open world this year already.
---
eh thats bs, if you're starting a new game the only thing you get is the new content while you dont in reality play any of the previous stuff, when people play wow they go to w/e max lvl is then and do dungeons there and ignore the previous expansion like the plague if they can, in gw2 everything is the current expansion but the problem lies that people who have 10k hrs in 7 years dont want people who just started to progress through the game a bit quicker so the community tries its best to fk newcomers in some areas as hard as they can ; aka wvwers dont want faster ranking so people can catch up to them cause they already did the grind and people should be greatful they're playing with such selfless and wonderful individuals
---
WvW has the issue because people want to win and to win you need to be competitive.  Its hard to win when you need to stop and hold someone's hand to teach them how to play a game.  WvW does very little teaching you how to play.  You literally enter a map with an NPC that gives you a very basic idea of what's going on from 7 years ago.  It doesn't explain metas, commanders, PPT, etc.  Its as if players should be responsible for doing it.  There are so many guides and videos online but people are lazy and want to be carried so they blob up and get carried by better players.  This just frustrates people trying to play the game and win.  Nobody wants to be the asshole to tell you to screw off on your ranger but it happens because people want to win and they are tired of the laziness.
---
Raids are no different.  Join a raid on random exotic gear with traits you think are good.  Don't do any research and see how long you last in a group.  Its just like WvW, its endgame content, be prepared for it at least a little bit.  People are willing to help if you're willing to help yourself.
---
I was reading about tempering expectations prior the living saga and new elite specs. What I thought might happen is instead of a new elite spec for each class, a new elite trait line would unlock for all classes as part of a campaign. I was thinking maybe the line would allow harpoons for land use and channel a Paragon theme as a call back to GW1. The trait line would be generic dps, heal, utility/tank for each tier that would be easier to balance as a flat power creep.  I was pretty bummed out when not even that was talked about. I haven’t logged in since I got the sky scale. I’m into WoW and don’t think I’ll be coming back to play.
---
Your explanation about ArenaNet's focus on development is a nice way of showing why a strictly capitalist mentality is flawed and just sucks.
---
Aside from the usual downvoting to question posts, I see people being mostly positive to newcomers, saying that there's ton of playing hours and stuff. Veterans behaving with a positive mentality won't really make any difference on a small scale and doesn't affect a corporate way of thinking, they won't refocus on repeatable content just because people are asking nicely for it, they'll just keep following their statistics. I see a lot of the the people being negative about the game being still passionate about it, and they express frustration as a feedback to make things better. At least they still care. It's common to label every negative opinion as toxic and create this conflict between positive vs negative, but over all, people commenting are at least still caring. People who hated it for real just moved on to something else and never came back. I also don't think anyone that is having a blast playing the game comes here and suddenly decides it's time to quit for good.
---
100%.  A new race or something that is completely fresh has to happen.  Just like mounts and gliding, it has to be game changing.  There has to be plenty of features and content to surround that though.  Interesting metas in PvE are what hold attention.  Collecting new currencies to buy minis are not.
---
so where are the screenshots and proof where Anet support is refusing to help you?
---
Elite specs are just part of the expansion level content.
---
We're missing fractals, Raids and exclusive rewards. If Strike missions had some kind of unique rewards or achievements it would've been at least something but no, we're just getting faceroll weekly bosses with shitty world boss chests.
---
Also we're missing Legendaries of any kind to work toward. Nothing from Pve, WvW or PvP. Not even a blank legendary item w/o skin like the ones that were datamined months ago. They literally have them and can release them but they've not even considered it, and I'm sure there are people like me that would indulge in such stuff just for having full legendary gear.
---
Finally we're missing the most meaningful part of an expansion: a new engaging Mechanic. We had gliders from HoT and Mounts from PoF. With the saga we're not getting anything, not even a new kind of "unbound magic" currency to amass for some nitpicky rewards. Not even a new stat combination.
---
We're actually not only far from expansion-like content, but even far from Living World Season content. And that Visions of the Past incoming? Yeah, we don't know much, but do we really expect anymore than Story missions? Because I don't.
---
I'm with you on how dire the situation is, but I made this post in hopes ArenaNet could get this specific, targeted feedback and hopefully change it as obviously this matters to a lot of people, not just myself. I 1000% agree with you. The amount of re-playable, multi-player cooperative content they release is abysmal for an MMO. This game feels more like a single player experience at this point.
---
The dodging and no global cooldown make a big difference. Plus positioning matters as well, whereas other games feel more like you're pushing buttons for the skills you want to use. But other than that you're just watching. 
---
Other action style games fall short, even if they take it a step further. It comes off as more of a gimmick. As far as I can tell, the main difference between gw2 and other action MMOs is having to aim your skills.
---
Devs have been softcore favoriting necro since Gw1. May not be at the top of the foodchain like, anywhere, but it seems to avoid a lot of butchering XD
---
Scourge got slaughtered last major balance patch with the shade changes but it wasnt really much in the end. Just made it half as fun to play tbh. Still murders people in WvW. Reaper on the other hand has been slowly buffed as the recent balance patches have rolled out lol. Last two big butcherings necro went through that I can remember without searching is the murdering of condi reaper, and the time when they made reaper no longer able to permashroud. Granted, both of those were relatively broken, truth be told.
---
I used to feel exactly like you did.  I couldn't figure out why they just don't start communicating because it's literally killing their own game.  And then sometime in the past few months I sadly came to the realization why they aren't communicating.
---
The reality is there isn't a long-term, big picture plan. At least not one worth getting excited about.  What you you see now is what we're going to get - filler holiday content, a short story with a map once every 4 months, a strike mission, and a few PvP updates. 
---
I love GW2, and I will still hop on once every 4 months to bust out the new story... but the reality is the glory days of what GW2 'could' or 'should' be are over.  What we see is what we get.
---
I think you targeted what you wanted to take from it and I really don't think that's fair because literally the whole point of the post was to encourage people to see how both demographics are important and I'm calling on ArenaNet to take account of it. Work on your reading comprehension.
---
I don't want to rain on your parade but years of valid criticism about everything got ignored. Most recent one: build templates. We gave honest, legit, constructive criticism about limitation, pricing, "characterbound-ness", functionality and whatnot a month before its release. All for Nothing. They are still loadouts btw, not templates.
---
The state of the game has nothing to do with the community IMO. There would be a happy community playing a third expansion right now and breathing life into the game if ArenaNET hadn't decided they didn't need new expansions. Expansion every 2 years, and replayable content in between... not that complicated. Players begged to have this type of system, instead we got some fairly fun living world maps that mostly didn't offer much replayability and excitement. Was anyone particularly hyped we killed Kralkatorrik? No, because it happened in 1 hour segments over a year and a half. They honestly made piss-poor decisions so many times in a row, prioritized selling us things for real money instead of building a fun game, and even stopped supporting most of the team PvE content. Why would veterans stay? Haven't played beyond 2-3 hours per new content release since December 2017. 
---
This game is heading to maintenance mode, let's just be honest here. ArenaNET isn't what it used to be. At least when Guild Wars 1 went to maintenance mode, we had something to look forward to. Here, there is nothing.
---
&gt;ArenaNet has infact spawned these very special rewards into the game before, infact you can see in this next screenshot; a player who SCAMMED support for the Champion's Sun.
---
And that's why they will not do it again unless you have valid proof and elevate ticket to lead level. It's true for almost any 100gold+ item in the game now.
---
"Grunts" are not allowed to do such things.
---
I feel you and agree, thanks for taking the time to read.
---
Why do you think they finally decided to make capes ? they need the money $$$$$$
---
Honestly.
---
  
---
My issue with gw2 are plenty.
---
But a few as gw1 vet are simple..
---
Pvp is worse.
---
Coop missions are gone and worse.
---
Story is okayish...
---
Every add on gave you tons of new stuff including pvp pve class ability (even when many were copy but they needed to be it was all standalone)
---
Anet partner here, that was my exact reaction too when I got this year’s card :(
---
They accidentally sent me two cards last year, and it was clear to see from the two that the signatures were actually handwritten. Getting a generic card about NCSoft instead this year hurt in a way that I didn’t expect
---
&gt; before ArenaNet can do anything to address the problems
---
It's hard to take this idea seriously when they haven't even acknowledged big problems. There isn't a reason to think they intend to address any of what you've written.
---
Guild Wars 2's combat system is fun when you don't know exactly how it works. It's also great for PvP, where the enemies can keep you from trivializing it. In high-end PvE, it breaks down almost as hard as ESO's animation-canceling based combat, though it's not quite THAT bad. But all the flexibility and options vanish.
---
&gt; I'm saying lets work together to keep a level head and not destroy the community before ArenaNet can do anything to address the problems.
---
You are being way too naive because you don't want to realize that Anet has no intentions to address anything. They'll milk us for a few quick bucks and funnel it into some console game. Once we've served our purpose we'll be discarded in a blink like they did with GW1.
---
This is why I actively encourage new people to stay away from it. Why would I help a corporation milk more people if they don't even put in the effort to hide it anymore? Telling people to buy GW2 makes me feel like I'm scamming them.
---
It's clear that you love the game and don't want to let it go, at one point I thought exactly like you did. It sucks.. but it is what it is.
---
Let's assume they do communicate about everything they're working on right now. Wouldn't it just be more LW episodes and some console game that's not even ready to show? Wouldn't that be just as disappointing?
---
Except that victims of domestic violence have to endure emotional or even physical abuse from someone they share an intimate relationship with. We, as a community, don't share an intimate relationship with ANet and the worst we have to endure are feelings of disappointment. 
---
So no, the analogy was not spot on. It wasn't even remotely related to the situation we have going on with GW2 at the moment.
---
I know it's easy to be blinded by rage and panic etc., and that the anonymity the internet provides might be an incentive for certain types of behaviour, but please PLEASE try to actually think about what you're about to post and maybe step away from your device for a moment and try to put worries into perspective.
---
Play the zones, do their respective metas and other such ways to get currency (Rift events in Jahai, meteorites in Istan, etc.).  Do hearts on multiple characters each day if you can be bothered, you can buy bundles for karma.  Play in Bjora Marches and convert Eternal Ice into whatever you need via karma.
---
I liked where you were heading and it reminded me of something. If we only focus on the negative we will only see negatives. Seld fulfilling a negative reality. So focus on the positives. Talk about what you adore about this game. This franchise. If it was as bad as some people make it out to be, it would not have the devoted fan base it does. I'll add what I love about the game. I love the endless customization. The countless builds, regardless of silly "meta's", and how the countless combination of look and styles there are. I have been playing on and odf for the whole of this games existence and I still have yet to do and see everything it has to offer. Hooray!
---
&gt; Guild Wars 2 is by no means the best MMO that’s ever existed, but right now it’s the only good one left.
---
What Anet did fucking right in both of their games is their server structure. This is by far the best I've seen in any game. In GW1 you can play with *everyone*, in GW2 it's NA/EU divided but within those regions you also can play with everyone. Also no server downtime.
---
I recently tried GW2 out, and I was disappointed that there isn’t a hard or even “medium” trinity like in other games, and even after getting all my skills unlocked, there were no dungeons yet until much, much later. While the story is really cool, and the quests are awesome,, I was really disappointed in the lack of group content for my first thirty levels or so, and learning classes with kits to heal like engineers, aren’t really considered healers. 
---
That plus not being able to be a support in pvp without being a firebrand was very disheartening
---
You get as much socialization out of a game as effort you put into making these bonds, if you needed someone to come and pet your head to get into a game I don't even know how to respond to this.
---
And if this wasn't your point, it seemed like it was.
---
I actually don’t understand how this game isn’t doing well if the problem is with not enough players, this is the only mmorpg I’ve ever played for more than like a day, it’s an actual game not just a grind fest
---
Just to be on the same page: of course I don't think this is on the level of domestic violence. But the mindset and circumstances of the two cases are almost identical, and that's the point.
---
Some people here grew up with the franchise and have been following it for half their livespans or longer. This game means a lot to them and it's part of their lives. They are in denial and try not to understand the situation they're in. They keep telling themselves things can be fixed if we try one more time, "just give them one last chance" (forget about the previous 10 last chances, we mean it this time! it'll work! for reasons!). Meanwhile Anet is just using them as ATM with less and less effort being put into keeping the illusion of development alive, but even after years these people keep sticking with them because they can't bring themselves to realize where this is going.
---
Microtransactions are a source of income for gw2...... So no, they're not pointless. That's money going to the development of this game.
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
they are pointless in the game. it is not a pay 2 win game. and i'm ok with the presence of microtransaction. if u want something u pay. otherwise you don't
---
Anet is NOT trying to save or develop gw2 anymore. Nothing will change their mind, they are working on new gw game or new ip that probably will be cross platform. And they are just milking players for next 2-3 years, until they have something new and gw2 will be at maintanence mode like gw1 is now.
---
Nothing will save gw2. 
---
Alliances are most likely never going to happen, same with expansions or especs. We will probably see 1 more raid wing and thats it. Fractals i think are not gonna be developed anymore.
---
Thats my take, ive uninstalled gw2 few weeks ago and not gonna comeback anytime soon, cause atleast first quarter have nothing to offer to me.
---
I think you're confused as to why we're even talking about microtransactions... You used it being a F2P game as an argument. I told you it's not a F2P game it's B2P with microtransactions. I said nothing about the content of the microtransactions that's completely unimportant to the conversation. What's important here is that expansion sales and microtransaction sales are a source of income for the game.
---
As someone who was effectively a brand new player  1 year ago (had a level 30 launch character and that's it), the game gave me 9ish months of really enjoyable content that my girlfriend and I played through together.  With that much content built up, the game felt endless and that there was always 5 new things to do every time you finished one.  After about 9 months of playing it quite a bit we got to the end of the content and stopped playing.  
---
But for a new player there is a *lot* to recommend the game.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to someone who likes these kind of games - the world is so rich and interesting and the content mostly enjoyable to play through one time.
---
Any build is viable, is that what you mean?
---
ok you are right. now tell me the names of the other games b2p which lasted 7 years without declining
---
&gt; "But templates are monetized the hell out of it!" So are gliders and mounts.
---
glider and mount *skins* are monetized, not the feature itself, and especially not to such a high degree. they are also account wide unlocks.
---
&gt; when have we ever gotten a raid with an expansion? Spirit Vale wasn't even released for a few weeks until after HoT.
---
it's been a few weeks since the announcement, the prologue, and E1, and not even the "roadmap" mentions raids.
---
&gt; I'd Argue Templates, Strike Missions, Ascended Cooking (with a huge quest associate), and Dynamic UI are at least expansion-level features
---
- already touched on templates, but they were (and still are) rather buggy. we are essentially beta testing. i'd count them as much as an expansion level features as the wallet, shared inventory, wardrobe, the LFG and the novelty tab. if anet's concept for them wasn't as ridiculously flawed to begin with i'd certainly be tempted to count this though.
---
- strike missions are very rough around the edges, resemble certain open world bosses in difficulty, lack incentive for repetition, *and are based on and arguably a step back from the concept an __intern__ came up with.*
---
- ascended cooking is as grand as and spectacular as any other lvl500 crafting profession, of which we got three at a time back in the day. i'd argue it was a bigger deal when they updated the crafting UI to allow us to open sub-recipes at the click of a button.
---
- dynamic UI is a really misleading name for the feature. it's the ability to hide individual categories of UI elements. it's CTRL + SHIFT + H split up into *preexisting* categories. that's it.
---
A good chunk of the game isn't though.
---
Also you can join non cm groups for fractals but stay away from cm groups, they dont like necro there. As far as dungeons, it is forgotten content so use whatever you want there.
---
why are you like this?
---
yes - if your guild can run a great team comp then power power power :)  100% correct
---
Since SadShots is coming back from a few years off he may not be wired into a situation like that, less than optimal team comps will appreciate you and you can still do some wonderful damage.
---
Hurray - hurray - it's Wintersday!!
---
I bought three shared inventory slots because it was on sale.  Come at me bro.
---
It's sad, but the game is in free fall. The game urgently needs something new and fresh to calm down people, Icebrood Saga has been fine so far, but I think the third expansion could be 20x better than season 5. 
---
I hope Guild Wars 2 end up with Icebrood Saga and they announce the third game.
---
same with build templets
---
&gt;gem store cosmetics because I don't care about that content.
---
&gt;gem store cosmetics... I don't care about that content.
---
&gt;gem store cosmetics... content.
---
Have fun playing **ultra** clean then; every day, every time - for the rest of your GW2 existence.
---
I prefer YouTube and Chill during my *daily* CMs + T4s.
---
All builds are viable. His questioned like he meant optimal. Why am i like what? You make no sense, he at least meant something
---
&gt;the whole point of the post was to encourage people to see how both demographics are important and I'm calling on ArenaNet to take account of it
---
What is this, a My Little Pony episode? How does it mean anything? If this was the whole point of you post, that it is worthless, not like anyone in a-net really going to read or consider it. 
---
They only ones you can reaslistically expect to be talking to are players, and for them you have a valuable message of "don't be negative, there are reason things are as they are, lets quiet down all hope that people higher up will fix it!". Doesn't quite make it in 2020 gw2.
---
Cause regular support are just a bunch of overworked dudes outsourced somewhere in Asia who have no clue about the game.
---
So many people in the raid scene left for Shadowbringers, it’s ridiculous...  If FF14 wasn’t on a sub model it probably would have put GW2 completely out of business.   And I feel like ESO could probably do the same if they even tried to market their game.  
---
And this is what’s going to happen if GW2 keeps putting 99% of their development efforts into the living story, which quite frankly sucks compared to other MMO’s.   Like look at GW2’s current story and then look at Shadowbringers, which is being praised for having the best story in any final fantasy game, not just mmo’s.  
---
It’d be comical if it wasn’t so sad that they even try to compete in this field while ignoring PvP/wvw—where their game actually has an advantage over others in the field.  Or even their raids are pretty good (not as great as ff14, but better than wow/eso/etc)...  Combat is one of the things that GW2 actually succeeds in, but they are constantly back shelving it to try to compete with other games in terms of story, crafting updates, their laughable attempt at player housing, or other areas that they stand no chance in.  It’s really frustrating to watch.
---
Well written and insightful
---
Not at all. It was a sincere question for OP to clarify their thinking and temper their expectations. The game GW2 will be at the end of 2020 isn't much different from what it is at the beginning of 2020. Asking for change and talking about wasted potential now, 7 years in, isn't useful or realistic.
---
Based on the title I was honestly expecting more about how Guild Wars 2 impacted other MMOs and what features they implemented because GW2 did it.
---
The article feels more like it's just reminiscing about good times in Guild Wars 2 and a couple cool things they added later on content wise, which isn't a bad thing. Just expected something a little different.
---
&gt;I'm saying lets work together to keep a level head and not destroy the community before ArenaNet can do anything to address the problems. 
---
ANET destroyed WvW and shot us one last time with there 0 content road map. Our big update for WvW the next quarter is a fucking mount fix. Are you serious? That shit could be done in an hour. Doesn't take 4 fucking months to roll something like that out. The game is dead. Move on. Downvoteing me to make your self feel better about it not being dead is just false hope like this entire post.
---
"  If you care about the game, help it grow  "
---
Too little too late. ArenaNet has done very little to deserve this kind of trust, and at some point you got to just cut your losses and move on. We, as a community, don't owe Anet a damn thing, least of all our money. GW2 has been made of unlived potential since HoT, maybe even before that. Why would what we do \*now\* suddenly make the game live up to that potential? Don't be delusional.
---
GW2’s systems encourage social behavior, It’s not the fact that somebody “came by and patted my head” it’s the fact that the chat interface, game mechanics, server structure, etc. all create an environment where it’s super easy to be social. It has less to do with the community and more to do with the actual environment. The person could have sent me absolutely nothing and done nothing but strike up a conversation and it would still be memorable.
---
A great example of a game that completely fails at this is BDO. BDO feels like a single player title that just happens to be inhabited and has a chat box but that chat box is full of all kinds of spam and it’s not really easy to communicate with somebody you’re **right in front of**. It doesn’t feel at all like an MMO, in order to make any kind of meaningful connection, you **HAVE TO** have discord.
---
On GW2, it’s real easy to be social right out the gate, no external programs needed, no voice chat needed. In game events happen that require multiple people and at least a little communication, right in your first map. Partying up has benefits, filling hearts with strangers is more fun than filling them alone as well. Your chat box also isn’t being spammed by a million things that have nothing to do with nearby chat or map chat. You’re not being notified that xxxpussyslayer69xxx enhanced their weapon to +50.
---
My point is, this is how MMOs should be, it’s how they were, it’s what made them good.
---
Just look at WoW, people complain all the time that their server phasing system is a huge strain on the community. If the social aspect of an MMO didn’t matter, then why would this matter?
---
People in this community are always on about how it “feels like a single player game” but they don’t know what they’re talking about, GW2 is one of the very few titles that actually **doesn’t** feel like a single player game. They should really get out there and try some other MMOs to gain some perspective.
---
U are saying too much. Game is dying cause u keep on spamming It Is. New players Read this and won't join. Sites read this and thibk that playerbase is angry while it is just a vocal minority.
---
Keep on doing what u are doing and it will be your fault
---
&gt; it’s an actual game not just a grind fest
---
You haven't hit the endgame right? You either play HD Gaia Online or running around pressing 1 until you have enough gold to turn into gems and repeat, it's as grindy as other MMOs, the focus is just in another sort of unlocks.
---
I don’t know man, i stopped playing after getting into the second difficulty level in Fractals, and I was really enjoying practicing them and trying to get into the next one. I’m likely wrong but are you possibly talking about literally the end end game? Like some of the last stuff you do in the game? Cause is that not meant to be Grindy so that people who are into that get to keep playing? Idk
---
it's probably too late... i think that after pof there is no hope anymore , they totally missed the scope of an expansion, they literally didn't understand the importance of making content fun to repeat and the importance of dungeons or something like that open for anyone with different tier of difficulty, they totally trew out of the window competitive spvp and wvwvw (this is a big foult also for gw2 section on twitch , cos some of the bigger gw2 streamer was spvp and wvwvw).
---
it's normal for a game Btp to make items on gemstore , but you can't make all the fashion stuff on it and literally don't give a shit about in game rewards (the only mode with good rewards were raids).
---
the last point for me is bugs... ppl on this reddit keep saying it's the same in every mmorpg, but this is not the truth, gw2 have some really code issue and arenanet seems to have no solution on the amount of bug with every release.
---
I couldn’t imagine playing a game that treats me this way. You should just move on.
---
about new race i think it will be good to add some mid-low level maps... i mean one of the best part of the game is levelling, new low level map can give to players a reason to creato more character
---
I appreciate your sentiments here, Crux, but the "if you care about the game, help it grow" argument just feels like empty advice when, in my opinion, "we" have been doing exactly that for years and years now. Except, instead of Anet recognizing how many of us still love raids, fractals/dungeons, WvW, sPvP, whatever, they cheated on us with other game projects and other ideas, and, predictably, it all blew up in their face, to the tune of hundreds of employees let go, likely at least one major game project shelved, the company founder/CEO leaving the studio, etc. etc. 
---
Now what? What are players supposed to do differently? Welcome the one whom they loved back with open arms, despite them cheating on you, neglecting you, telling you that Alliances and balance patches and tournaments were coming, only for those promises to look like lies or half truths with every passing month? I don't mean to sound edgy here, but in many ways I think a good bulk of players are dealing with a kind of grief. The game that they have, in fact, cared about and done so much to help grow over the years has pretty much given up the ghost because Anet haven't met the players half way. It takes two to tango, and for the players who have put thousands and thousands of hours into keeping this game one of the best out there, it's incredibly hurtful and discouraging when it feels like it's Anet who has given up on the game, not us. 
---
As a WvW player first and foremost, it's not my fault or anyone else's fault that Anet doesn't care about the game mode. I've put in my time, leading guilds, leading zergs, following behind others who did the same in the past, and some who still do so now. I put in my part, as have thousands of other players. We've been here "caring about the game, helping it to grow", and all we have to show for it is, in this example, a game mode that is increasingly smelling of dirt and pine wood. 
---
What more do you want from us? What exactly does Anet want from us? At some point, as human beings, we have to recognize when we're being taken advantage of and when it's not worth it anymore. Just because the community has become more vocally critical of the game in recent years, doesn't mean speaking the truth out loud is less valuable than sugar coating the state of the game for new players. I wish all this weren't so, but I think the players have done their best to keep the game going. It's Anet who hasn't done their part. The hot potato has been in their lap for a very long time, not ours. We've had our turn, it's theirs now to make the game great again.
---
they gave up GW2 when they put it on maintenance mode while all working on side projects, and good DEV all left for Amazon. This game is done especially more mmo coming out 2020.
---
They tried that already. Their parent company fired half the studio in response.
---
I want to know what rewards are being “funneled into the cash shop”  since ice brood saga came out.
---
I'll suggest buying 12 or 15 slot boxes when starting. When you really commit to a character buy 18 then save up for exotic gear, runes , sigils and ascended trinkets, backs and weapons when you arrive at lvl 80, then when you're done with your character you make your ascended armor of choice, then go and see where you can get 24 slots gear from and check if buying those precedes your wish to make leggy gear, be it weapons or backs or armor, when you have done so check if you find the grind to max it on 32 slots worthwhile.
---
Note: any cheap or free 20 slot bag is very nice and I'd suggest you use it. Your starter backpack will be with you for quite some time.
---
Spousal abuse is not strictly physical.
---
It's not just NCSoft. There's been talks for a long time about ArenaNet's mismanagement of resources and we're just seeing the results of that. 
---
Guild Wars 2 is one of the most ambitious MMOs ever created though, so I'm not going to fault them too much for their failures. I can appreciate a developer that's willing to take big risks in crafting a unique product.
---
Your statements about people need to move on if the game is not for them any more AND GW2  needing both casuals and veterans are kind of contradictory given its the vets playing the sidelined content that are mainly complaining. 
---
I don't move on because my guild still plays WvW and I love playing with my friends therefore I am still here, still being critical of the game and Anet for its reduction of content production to the lowest common denomonator. I sincerely believe this is a mistake.
---
TL DR. Stop supporting ANET SOFT.
---
No, I'm neither saying this nor they do that. But nice try on polemics.
---
I do agree with many of the points. I hadn’t really thought about it but after playing for hours daily over a few years, I very rarely play at all these days in favour of single player games. Part of that is down to me, with changing tastes and priorities - but I can’t shake the feeling that while I adored new specs, neither of the expacs or living world seasons managed to capture that same magic of the original game. Path of Fire was much better for it, but not quite there.
---
There was a real sense of exploration and losing yourself in the fantasy from the vanilla release, with expertly crafted maps and intertwining stories per region. I feel like living world and HoT in particular really pushed content that was aimed towards the loot train runners, and a lot of the lore and explorable content was very surface level. Heck, even the hidden events and vistas didn’t seem nearly as original as the base game!
---
Likewise I remember losing a ton of interest when dungeons were discontinued. Fractals are _not_ the same, and nothing beat wandering into a dungeon with some randos and clearing story mode, then explorable paths. I really missed that progression system and wasn’t willing to spend all week running raids, which otherwise really appealed to me.
---
Now I’m aware I could be looking at it through rose tinted glasses, but I think you’re right - the game is no longer what I look for, which is a change on both sides.
---
Ngl I forgot what I was on about by the end of this, turned into a vent. Apols
---
&gt; willing to take big risks
---
"we made a good thing, it's already working and people ask for more of it - let's drop it and reinvent something else"
---
Mismanagement aside the studio itself is capable of finding its own footing and has talented people on it that have been pushing itself back toward the root of what people loved about the franchise. It just seems that NCsofts greedy little mitts are making it more difficult.
---
Cynicism is not what this is called. Its cynical to think the game is dying when it is literally in its last throes. Theres no more content. The only content we have is go to work daily to make money to spend on the game 
---
That's the only content that is being released at a regular rate
---
great video. I always enjoy your content. The jukes! lmao. Good times. More WvW content?
---
let's imagine a world in which NCsoft is thanos. in that very same world ANet would still be (avengers 1) loki or some such.
---
they are of different caliber, but neither is innocent.
---
I don't quite understand your argument.
---
As long as a business is generating profit with least opportunity costs, there's no logical reason for a parent organization to shut them down. 
---
We all know Anet probably lost a crap ton of capital investments due to all the failed projects, whether it's requested by NCSoft, or Anet's own initiatives.
---
But that's what businesses do. If you can't balance favourable profit for ROI while also investing in future projects, you're out. 
---
At the end of the day, it's the market that controls the businesses, and we (most of us, for now) are their target market. But my monetary support for the company depends on how much satisfaction/utility they can deliver. If they fail, they fail, there's nothing I can do and that's the extend of it. 
---
I don't think the word "Evil" is right in this case.
---
If you look at city of heroes their profits after the redesign of free to play increased profits and they actually had a very high quarter before NCsoft shut it down for “design not fitting with the brand”.  And aside from shutting down the game they also destroyed the studio
---
Guild Wars 2 was already backtracking on its design philosophies within months of the game's launch through adding Ascended gear. Fractals and Agony were then added so you had to grind for Agony Infusions to do higher level content. The first expansion added raiding with a distinct DPS/Tank/Healer Holy Trinity which even became the meta in Fractals. You even had a "gear treadmill" in the sense that new stat combinations were created which had a DPS advantage over what could be gained in old content.
---
That being said, I think they were right in doing so. They just wanted to see what would happen if you created a game without dedicated tanks/healers and without lategame gear progression.
---
&gt; The state of the game has nothing to do with the community IMO. There would be a happy community playing a third expansion right now and breathing life into the game if ArenaNET hadn't decided they didn't need new expansions. Expansion every 2 years, and replayable content in between... not that complicated.
---
The only explanation for not doing this is the expansions weren't profitable enough. The revenue jump during expansion quarters was not especially high and the development costs were probably quite high given the artwork involved. I actually do think Anet could do expansions at a more budget cost given the artwork is probably the highest cost, focus on content NOT maps, but they don't seem to want to.
---
I''m sorry but Anet never said their focus would be 100% on Guild Wars 2. Not once not ever. They said certain projects were canceled. They didn't say all side projects were canceled.
---
Nor is it right or health for a company to have or work on just one product or one IP. When I ran the business I ran, if a company wanted me to carry one specific line of product and not invest in anything else or expand my business I'd ignore that costumer. Had I done that, just stayed on one product without expanding, that business would have been gone in a decade. This is not the way businesses work. It's not good for them to work that way.
---
Anet would not survive on just one or two titles or one or two IPs. There is such a thing as natural attrition. Companies need to find new revenue streams. This doesn't necessarily mean they have to abandon older projects, but obviously they're going to expand. 
---
I agree we're starved for information but some stuff is just simple logic.
---
Anet has boxed themselves into a corner because there is no gear-treadmill, but they also can't offer decent cosmetic rewards because it affects their cash shop income.
---
Progression, one of the prime motivators of MMO players, can't happen anymore, so we're getting some story content and gem-store stuff until the game dies apparently.
---
Aw. I remember you getting me lnhb with your static ages ago
---
I'm not a experienced GW2 gamer, but from what I see, much of the negativity comes from gw1 vets who hate the game because of what it is. They will always be negative about it for how much different it is. 
---
But guess what, they risk losing the players they have that like the game.
---
Not saying everything is perfect, far from it. Just a thing from this sub.
---
I'm not debating any of that.
---
What I'm saying is that controllers wouldn't allow exploiting GW2's combat to its full potential, making many of its intricacies and "tricks", that are learned once you reach a certain level of expertise, irrelevant and redundant.
---
And many skills are balanced around those high level outputs and made to counter them.
---
All of that becomes irrelevant if players can't pull that stuff off anymore, therefore there is no need for it, and combat has to be simplified and rebalanced to make it more useable with a simple gamepad.
---
The thing is they made their minds long ago when anet started working on 2 other projects while instructing the devs to make it look like [nothing had changed](https://mobile.twitter.com/delafina777/status/1098736620780441600?lang=en) in regards to gw2. 
---
But it backfired since those 2 projects were canceled and at the same time they had neglected gw2 by siphoning many gw2 devs into those projects.
---
Right now they are doing the same with a third project [console game](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/eg8epo/arenanet_is_working_on_unannounced_3rd_person/) and I don't blame them because game studios have to branch out eventually. However, they shouldn't have done it at the expense of their main cash cow, not this much at least.
---
At this point they'll continue to milk it doing the bare minimum until is more profitable to move the remaining LS teams into the new game, other future projects, or disband them.
---
Exactly. And I feel like the remaining are scrambling to fix it. Honestly I wish they could pull a bungie and pull away from the publisher or find one that has their best interests at heart or pushed for them to fulfill potential instead of cutting corners and allowing every other game they own to be a title that wishes it was BDO
---
You can raid with 10 hybrid builds. It's more fun but requires players to be good and it's harder, propably impossible, to pug.
---
Oh, it's definitely a "soft" trinity unlike most other games. It's just very telling that they added what's clearly a tank specialization and a healer specialization right as raids came out, and started designing encounters to greatly benefit from having those two roles in one's party.
---
The problem that everyone discovered in core GW2 was that not incentivizing dedicated tanking/healing/supporting is that you end up with a zergy damage meta. What the big question that needs to be addressed by developers isn't how to get rid of tanks/healers, but how to make tanking/healing fun enough that people *want* to play them to not avoid the classic situation of sitting around in Stormwind waiting for a Warrior to come tank Strath for you.
---
I truly want longbow for Necromancer, I'd give my soul for it.
---
Wasn't the NCsoft acquisition relatively recent? Unfortunately Anet isn't in a position to leverage their own release from them. If they had a massively successful expansion launch maybe, or even a successful GW3 announcement and reception. But GW3 is never happening and GW2 is entering its twilight.
---
Ive been playing gw as long as i can rememeber, like many others i saw my friends leave cause fractals and raids were just not coming.
---
Yet i remained, hopefull for changes.
---
Strikes were announced, and i thought it would bring my mates back. One guess how that went.
---
And now i am also starting to lose hope. All good things come to an end. Now its also time for me to pack up and look for something new as well. It was fun while it lasted.
---
&gt; Realize that your negativity and cynicism can become a self-fulfilling prophecy of defeat for the game's community.
---
It's not my responsibility to keep the game entertaining, it is only to play it should it already be compared to other offerings for my entertainment-focused spare time.
---
&gt; If you care about the game, help it grow and have clear eyes about the root of the problem. 
---
I care about **consuming** the game. I did. There's nothing left despite ultra-casual play. Hence I'm out.
---
Shoot death
---
Anet killed themselves by trying to work on multiple unannounced projects which failed while not giving enough content to gw2. The rate at which content was introduced with the release of the game and the first 6 months or so after compared to living story releases and PoF is abyssmal.
---
The game has been slowly bleeding out players, and many have warned about this and said you need to focus on player retention through repeatable cooperative content. Instead we got single player non repeatable content, and assurance that a constant stream of new players and casuals would be enough. Except mmos are a niche market and the stream of new players has dwindled, probably partly due to bad word of mouth.
---
Not calling it trash. Been enjoying the new map a bit, did a couple strikes. But also unconvinced about their line about expansion-level content. Just thinking about new elite specs—which our OP points out, would certainly excite some number of people. 
---
In any “expansion-level” thing—a saga, a new expansion pack, whatever else— when would you, a player, want to start developing the skills towards that new spec? Especially since the mechanic of getting the spec involves earning skill points to unlock traits. 
---
The OP suggests that “hanging out the sign” would be alluring. When in the past, relative to “expansion,”  have we known about new elite specs? When have the developers “hung out the sign”? 
---
New maps, new map currency, strikes, don’t scream “maintenance” like a chunk of grumps on this sub think. But the “saga” and the publicity around it, and the way it fits the pattern of story, not “expansion-level,” releases—and the way “expansions” have operated in the past—do not give me the confidence to a) expect a new elite spec, and b) expect the other things that have come in “expansions”
---
Thanks for the tip, currently I have a spellbreaker, dragonhunter and a elementalist. I don’t play them as often as my reaper becouse I don’t enjoy my warrior and I feel like dragonhuter was really underpowered, back when I played him.
---
Thanks again for the feedback and will look at the other classes. :)
---
Just gave that a look to see what it says, every crash is a "kernel power" and then just says "The system has rebooted without cleanly shutting down first. This error could be caused if the system stopped responding, crashed, or lost power unexpectedly." which is basically what's happening each time.  
---
BSOD automatic restart is off.   
---
There's nothing listed as a crash log, but there is "ArenaNet.log" and it shows that a memory couldn't be read. I'll reach out to support and ask them. Thank you!
---
[My favorite comment on the forums about feedback for build templates.](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/1087726/#Comment_1087726) Probably it's still too early for changes according to this person (:
---
And do you play in higher leagues in solo que? Like platinum-legendary??
---
Thanks for the reply
---
whoooooooooops     
---
omg tenebrous pistols look wayyyy different than pact pistols -.-  
---
clearly im not a fashion guru :/    
---
ty for the outfit! marauder coat looks weird on my characters but maybe that's just me
---
&gt;wouldn't allow exploiting GW2's combat to its full potential, making many of its intricacies and "tricks", that are learned once you reach a certain level of expertise, irrelevant and redundant.
---
That's why I gave you BDO as an example, GW2's combat is considerably shallower than BDO's and the complexity of tricks and the speed/precision on the execution that is required in GW2 is also much lower.
---
When I take your old quote here:
---
&gt;Let's say something like starting to cast a long heavy skill, cancel mid-animation to bait the enemies to your location, turn around, blink to the top of some terrain and instantly look back and cast a different ground target skill from high ground just in the middle of the various enemies you baited. And you'd probably have to slot a stun-break and dodge in there if they managed to CC you while trying to pull that off. That requires an amount speed and accuracy and many simultaneous actions that a gamepad just won't give you.
---
BDO is basically that, at a higher pace, with at least twice the amount of skills + many hidden behind combos, without tab targetting, with cc and defensive mechanics that are too complex and diverse to explain here\*.
---
As someone who played both games at highly competitive level, I can't think of a single aspect of GW2 that is more difficult than in BDO. And they still managed to pull an extremely convincing and playable console version.
---
What you call
---
&gt;high level outputs
---
in GW2, is normal gameplay in BDO, be it on console or PC.
---
\*if you're still interested, [this youtube search](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=bdo+iframe+canceling+armor) returns good videos on the subject.
---
Literally no longer suprised.   
---
And they wonder why it's the most disappointed MMO of 19
---
Is hard to be welcoming when you don’t feel yourself welcomed in the first place.
---
While I enjoyed GW2, I talked about it to friends, I recommended it, I reported bugs, I helped newbies out, I bought stuff from the cash shop and I also respectfully spoke my concerns about the game in the officially provided channels. I think I was a great fan and a good enough customer.
---
But I stopped enjoying it, I wouldn’t recommend a game I don’t enjoy to anyone.
---
I own ANet nothing.
---
I would like however to enjoy it again and I would like to recommend it but it is really hard to do because my concerns aren’t heard, my bug reports go months or years unsolved, and I don’t feel that the company that runs this game respects its customers at all.
---
They lie to them after all, they don’t recognize their mistakes, they employ some nasty anti consumer practices in behalf of monetization, etc. Why would I ignore its very evident defects when talking about it?
---
GW2 in 2019 ¯\\\_( ツ )\_/¯
---
I agree that we don't. Even worse : this call to action is contrary to common sense. We have more to lose trying to care than we can win by ignoring and just stopping altogether. Especially compared to what our impact can be. 
---
Not talking about if gw2 is truly in decline or just waiting to rise. For this reflexion it doesn't matter.
---
Because we're customers of a product. And worse : it's a product we cannot custom. For those who are ashamed to see wasted potential and lament in their memorirs of gw glories : check the amount of hour played, realize that gw2 was pretty rentable for you, and move on because the husk you see is not worth bothering for when there are hundreds of other games (not necessarily mmos) or other things to do than gaming. Complaining about a product where you don't have voice to the chapter leads nowhere. You don't even represent a fraction worth bothering for as an individual. 
---
And to those who are starting, or currently are still having fun : just enjoy it. Maybe you'll get bored later, but for now it's fine. Enjoy it just like others did enjoy it in the past.
---
The only tangible thing we can lose is servers. If gw goes offline... Well that would suck. But I don't think it's on the table right now, so fear not this night.
---
You're failing to see my point. A reaper can also skip nightfall and well of power to just immediately get into shroud and use soul spiral. Im not talking about damage, Im talking about the speed to set up the burst. In my post before, I even addressed the fact dgh can place traps before the boss. Ignoring this, the full burst of dgh takes longer to set up than the full burst of reaper. And yes, Ive played with many good dghs, as a reaper. a common comment is that they dont even get to do any damage by the time Im bursting. I am not commenting on damage. Dgh outranks reaper by far there, again, Im pointing out simply the speed at which reaper is capable of dishing out their burst. If you still dont believe me, then youve either never played with a power reaper, or the ones you have played with have been dog shit horrible.
---
Thank you for this post!
---
What i think a lot of people do not understand (also in this thread) is that the 'this game is dead' comments are having a significant negative impact on the player influx. In todays time when you want to invest a lot of time in a online game, you always visit the forum / reddit of the connected community. In gw's case, the reddit has not only a very negative atmosphere about the game, but also a lot of toxix behavior against people who have a genereally positive opinion on the game. All of this "white knights vs. whiny veterans" memewars is really funny to me, but if i were not yet invested into this game, it would 100% put me off and keep me from playing it.
---
Every "should i play this game?" post gets spammed by "game is dead; arenanet hates us" comments, which more often then not actually seem to hold the op off from buying pof or investing more time into gw2. And for no good reason at all. Gw2 is still probably the best value for money game you can get. The raids in this game are great, they just dont offer the right reward structure and replayability. Every single person, and especially every mmo fan, should play gw2 and will have a lot of fun for little money. The insane thing is, that the people who spam thos posts are often frustated people of the raid or spvp communities who complain about a lack of players, while (wrongfully) driving every potential new member of their communities away from the game.
---
I understand those players are ultimately the product of bad business practices by arenanet and ncsoft, but as someone who is reasonably invested in the game, but never was very invested in any forums or reddit, the toxic comments worry me more and make me more sad than the so called "content drought" and bad game updates.
---
I would much rather have elite specs come out as a part of an expac rather than piece meal release in living story.
---
This is going to be counterintuitive to a lot of people on this sub, but actually GW2's only hope is if people spend *more* money on the current content and microtransactions and enough new players join the game to prove to NCSoft that GW2 is profitable enough to warrant enough investment to hire more developers to work on core content such as raids and fractals.
---
If the current content proves to be unprofitable, then the only logical next step from the publisher's perspective is maintenance mode.
---
So you're arguing that they will release no new features over the next year or two? This is it? Where's your basis for that?
---
&gt; If anything they should focus more on stuff outside living world in 2020. they basicly only did open world in 2019 except for 1 raid and the warclaw. 
---
That was one raid and one warclaw too much. If they can convert that effort into open world content in 2020, they will be in a better place.
---
you also forget that PoE is competing with.. what?
---
diablo.. and thats pretty much it.
---
as far as I know and thats why PoE had it so easy there arent a lot.. or even any? other online dungeon crawlers.
---
GW2 however, especially during its first years had to prove itself against the competition and most noteably WoW. LS1 went okay.. but then.. especially after the content drought before HoT... thats when the honeymoon phase was gone.
---
I'm someone that got in with my then girlfriend, and we played the ever living shit out of the game. As time went on though, We got the first expac, and it was dreadfully different, even challenging. The problem was, it felt hard to do without groups. We were noobs then, so ofc it was hard to kill stuff.   
---
Everything feels so empty right now, and its all so confusing so we stopped.
---
Should be top comment. 
---
We all want this game to be supported. We begged Anet for dungeons when they left then we began to support their new direction. They abandoned the direction as soon as players wanted more. Same for anything else the players want. I regret every dollar I've ever given the gemstore.
---
