When Balthazar attacked Vlast to turn him into a weapon so that he could defeat Kralkatorrik, did you consider him heroic?
---
---
---
not me
---
?
---
we should be able to consume magic too since we are aurene’s champion.
---
Nice!
---
I for example come to play and do my best, not to socialize... But that's just me. I like the cooperative aspect of the game, I don't come to it to make friends or be in an everlasting party.  I will reply kindly if you ask me anything tho.
---
I love him, but he doesn't act like a Sylvari at all. I would probably be annoyed by it less if we actually had a Sylvari rep who carried that Arthurian nobility with them instead of just being a knock-off Asura like Canach is.
---
Currently doing it, most days I just bother to flip for a 20g or so profit, but some days I can go up to 100 or more.
---

---
Dyes do still work but are a bit sketchy since people get the pricy ones from birthday gifts. I personally like flipping pre's and named exotics. Sometimes legendaries.
---
It just takes patience :)
---
That would make sense, its good for economic (by keeping precursors and coresponding materials on adequate level) not to mention entertaiment value.
---
Well, what sort of stuff do you want to do? I understand that you don't know all of what's available, I'm talking in general terms.
---
For example, would you like to do **more things with a small party?** Dungeons or Fractals.
---
Dungeons are a bit... rough around the edges let's say, but they're quick and easy. Fractals can be daunting, but anything below, say Fractal 20, we kinda expect new Players. Just ask questions and be willing to learn.
---
**Do you want to fight People?** Small, more skill based--5v5 PvP. Find a Build to start off with (Metabattle will be fine) and hop in on some unranked.
---
Larger group, more objective base? Hop into Eternal Battlegrounds in WvW, find a commander tag, and follow them. Ask questions, but use /map (Not /team)
---
**Do you want to farm gold?** Look up the RIBA farm in Silverwastes, or check the LFG panel for a "Season 4 Train" (Less gold, more variety) that goes around to most of the Season 4 maps doing the meta events.
---
Alternatively, if you're liking the idea of meta events, try the HoT ones. Specifically Auric Basin, Dragons Stand, or Tangled Depths.
---
**Perhaps you want to fill out your wardrobe?** Well, lots of maps have associated weapon or armor sets. Take a look at Ambrite Weapons. If you like them, head to Dry Top and start doing events. Or Thunderhead for the Ambrite Weapons. Or Istan for Astral or Stellar. Or Silverwastes for Luminescent. Or Verdant Brink for Bladed Armor. Most maps starting at Dry Top onwards have some associated weapon or armor.
---
**Perhaps you want a PvE challenge** Keep on Fractals until you can do T4, or find a Raid Training group. Getting into raids fully can be problematic, but you can usually find training groups during prime time.
---
So yeah, if you can give me even a vague "I like the sound of this goal" I can give you a tailored answer.
---
Also if you kick them you get "why kick" or just abuse. Yeah, sorry for kicking you from a group which requirements you clearly not fit, come join again and leech along. The mentality of some players in this game is actually insane.
---
Wholesome af!
---
i just heard about the lay offs, is it worth getting into the game now?
---
Hope you like it. This is prob the last legendary weapon ever,
---
It is so boring that after doing 7 bosses I had enough and went to HoT metas to farm these Amalgament Gemstones (for legendary) and farming at least 250 LS4 currencies for possible Aurora 2.0.
---
I have a [section on it](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Crafting_2) with some links. Take a look at the other sections too if you want. Also I am on NA, if you want any help in game or getting a handle on things.
---
This is an impossibly open ended question. They are everywhere and nowhere depending on your tastes.
---
Every person see "good/bad" differently.
---
Simply go to the bank&gt;wardobe page. There you gonna find ALL skins available in-game.
---
Pick the skin you like, then find it in gw2 wiki. You gonna see all the information about it, like how to get it etc.
---
Is Power or Condi Quickness Firebrand better? I see that both are somewhat evenly matched on MetaBattle and SnowCrows, but I don't have the resources to have both gear sets.
---
Didn’t even know there was that in the game thx!
---
you probably minimized the bag it was in
---
Power is easy to gear and is better [in fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand). Depending on the fight, [condition quickness](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition%20quickness/) should be better in most raids with exceptions being on power or burst heavy fights (like CA, Sam, Sloth, etc).
---
For Fractals and dungeons definitely power. For raids it depends on the encounter, but generally speaking in most encounters where you want condi, you don't want to play Firebrand+Renegade(there are exceptions). So if you can only get one for now, I'd recommend power, since it's also rather cheaply gotten (mostly berserker, some diviner)
---
What's fun to you? Do you like being mechanically challenged? Do you like having those high dps numbers? Fast characters or slower? Etc.
---
Wow, thats awesome!
---
Really like the first pic, with Kralk's head in the background. Hope you'll do more cool stuff like that
---
Flip dyes? If you were buying unid and selling them id'd, that's gambling. Not flipping
---
I would say I generally prefer melee characters, usually ones who are fairly mobile. I’m not super concerned with being able to top the charts as I’m not sure how intensely I’ll play, but I would like a class that can pretty easily solo most/all of the non-group content.
---
it‘d be cool to have sth similar but I think Anet’s current trend in armor design is a bit more out there than that. At least concerning Elegy/Requiem/Mist Shard stuff.
---
I‘m hopeful that we’ll get more tasteful sets like the corsair one in the future though, something like your example could work in a cantha expansion for sure.
---
Like many before me have already said, I want legendary weapons for the skins, mostly. The fact that they take a while to craft is a nice challenge and adds a log term goal in game. 
---
Also, I do it for the shiny footsteps. xD
---
Mounts have become such a default thing nowadays, I realized a while ago that I hardly ever walk around and admire the environment anymore. The shiny footsteps are an incentive for me to get off my mounts more (as much as I love them) and stop to smell the roses. 
---
And for example I always complete all my jumping puzzles with a character that has shiny footsteps. It just makes me giddy. :3
---
Glad I could help! :)
---
Well, you need either HoT or PoF to join raids. Getting those gifts you with instant 80 unlocks and given the amount of "hey I'm new, boosted and now I'm lost!"-threads we see here, there is a chance at least some of them are newlings ;)
---
Especially if they raided in other mmos and assume gw2 is "just another mmo" and raiding would be similar to other games too.
---
You're still expected to tell why you're here, your role in the group.
---
I prefer my autotargeting to be on.
---
If it's off, you have to click a target before you use the skill. The skill will activate so you get traited buffs (like the beastmastery swiftness with shouts) but you dont get the res effect
---
If it's on, it should automatically target an ally (downstate player) in the vicinity. I'm not sure if it works for NPCs though
---
yeah i hit that wall a few weeks ago, i decided to try again in another year if i should run out of things to do again. the last collection is so big
---
I love this :)
---
*Who?*
---
Starlord man, legendary outlaw. *Sigh*
---
Yeah, I'm fond of Rainbow Railroad, we supported them with our 2017 fundraiser after the news about the killings in Chechnya came out.
---
We could definitely revisit them as a potential fundraiser again! Back then, Tyria Pride was kind of just a couple people interested in doing something good, so I'm sure we could raise even more funds this year \^\^
---
We're planning to make another reddit post after the meeting, with all the final details about the event &amp; the fundraiser - I hope the GW2 redditors won't consider that too spammy \^\^°
---
I don't keep 60fps consistently, but never drops below 30 excepting periods of extreme network lag. Your system should be outperforming mine by a wide margin though. Benchmarks have your GPU giving at least twice the framerate in almost every game they checked. Your CPU being overclocked should be outperforming mine as well, despite being a generation older.
---
Do you get expected performance in other games? If not, you might try reinstalling your drivers and testing your HDD/SSD. If that doesn't work I'd double check the BIOS settings to make sure nothing is set incorrectly. I've noticed my computer runs noticeably hotter when I'm playing GW2 than with other games, maybe your CPU is throttling itself down due to excessive heat? If so you'll probably need to reduce your overclocking or invest in a better cooling system. My wife had to upgrade the cooling unit for her CPU in order to play GW2, even without overclocking.
---
I don't think I can be of much more help than that though. If none of that works, you'll probably have to ask someone who knows more about it than I do and provide detailed specs. Best of luck though, these kinds of issues are frustrating.
---
Brother! I make extensive use of rocket boots.
---
I'm considering getting the Nightfang griffon skin and sun gecko springer skin before they leave in 3 days but I'm worried that the mounts won't see much use after the new mount comes out. Will they still have a use or will I basically be throwing away $50 to make mounts I won't ever use again look cool?
---
&gt; Kill kralk in the mists no overload of magic in Tyria
---
The overload of magic is all throughout the Mists. The entire system. It doesn't matter where we kill Kralk, the effects will be the same.
---
The only benefit I can see in fighting Kralk in the Mists is that the gods might actually be willing to help. Remember Kormir told us that the gods didn't want to absolutely desolate Tyria by fighting the dragons? *Maybe* they'd be willing to mess up some Mists landscapes instead.
---
"Commander, over here!"
---
Souns about right.
---
Maybe a friendly hacker logged onto your acc for a few weeks to get you your daily log in rewards
---
Good luck with the event, might attend if I can.
---
Account bound or can they be sold?
---
How cute is that??
---
I'm just expecting this statistically to get banned since that video and their youtube is blocked for me.
---
  Its good to raise awareness but atm I don't see the evidence purely because its deleted links for me. Without major "hey mods and anet here is screenshots" this looks kinda witch hunt.
---
Instant Kill?  B.b.but Spiderman doesn't kill anyone!
---
We've heard of them refunding the difference when purchases are made shortly before a sale, but not refunding *then* upgrading.  
---
My Guess:  Either they will just give you back the difference, and then you can buy the "PoF deluxe upgrade" in the gem store -or- maybe they'll upgrade you manually and then give you the difference between full price standard and sale price deluxe.
---
I would be extremely surprised if they would rollback/reset/cancel your account as a solution for this, especially without your explicit consent.
---
Usually if you bought the game just a few days(not sure what the actual limit is) before it goes on sale support can refund the difference. That is just from what I've seen I haven't gone through the process myself.
---
I have a mouse button for mounts.   alt+, ctrl+, shift+. alt shift+. shift ctrl+, alt ctrl+.   thats enough for 7 mounts. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Use hotkey modifiers for everything, makes you faster.
---
Balthazar wasn't a god anymore (thank the ~~six~~five)...
---
Well its not like you're learning english as second language almost everywhere now. Also its not like you get bombarded with it on every social media platform there is. Most content is created in english, so if you're looking into topics or research different information (not just gaming) nowadays you're forced to at least read and comprehand the language.
---
30 years ago it was ok not understanding it, nowadays even shoolkids know english ...
---
Lots of people boost who are new...so theres no guides for that?
---
I believe they've said it's a level of effort thing. It's way easier to make 6 armor pieces that don't interfere with each other than to make 6 armor pieces that don't interfere with any other existing armor skin.
---
[removed]
---
The absolutely fastest way would be to buy any expansion and using the boost which comes with it.
---
If you are a leather wearer I think the mask is dead up Sneakthiefs.
---
Not my xp in WvW at all, and I play almost daily. There's like 3 choice people you need to block and it's pretty smooth aside from random trolls spamming team or something, but it's just spam. People are pretty nice as a whole.
---
Yikes. =s
---
Do you want to learn the mechanics of your character(s) or the mechanics of your enemies?
---
If you want to learn about your character(s), necro isn't a bad choice: it's very forgiving, it allows you to experiment with combo fields, and it'll give you a chance to see how conditions work on you and your enemies. You can do all that without having to worry too much about the enemy in front of you.
---
If you want to learn about your enemies, thief is a good option: you've got dodges coming out your ears and it's straightforward to play. You'll know when you miss a dodge, but it's more forgiving than ele, particularly with Signet of Malice and Invigorating Precision. Once you learn your enemies' moves, you'll almost never take damage.
---
If you want to learn both, stick with ele! You don't need to make a new one, just spend some time in low level areas until you feel more comfortable. Read your skills and traits. Don't try to tackle everything at once. Make it a goal to make use of one new skill or trait until you understand it. Use the wiki and ask questions here on things you don't understand. Don't bother with tankier gear-- in most HoT/PoF maps, it'll buy you a few seconds at most. Learning your character will take you much further.
---
Good job, you have now entered the true end game called tp wars. We barons just play tp cuz fuck grinding
---
In raids that's a real long 1-&gt;0% and if we're spaghetti-ing the end then it gets more and more pog to know
---
Yea either you didn't remember correctly or your buddy has logged in religiously to collect the daily login rewards for you.
---
Haha actually funny. Made my day tho
---
You can use standard enemy models. Turns off all LoD gunk clusterfuck
---
I will probably decide based on the skin, rather than price. You might be able to get the rest through map currency like requiem. But thanks for the heads up.
---
you might find guides for endgame content like raids and top tier fractals. there are also some guides on how to get/craft ascended gear (top tier gear). but of course you won't find guides for regular content.
---
since the usual answer to the question "where to start?" is "at the beginning"
---
I'm not bothered by new players not chatting or not responding and I'll tell you why. Perhaps they don't realize you're talking to them specifically, they might not have that chat channel activated or they don't speak the language. Some new players might not even know how to enter chat mode or change channels. I know because i could be talking in party chat and they might be responding in in Say chat or even map chat. 
---
I'll tell you what does bother me is when I make a fractal group titled "T4 Dailies Food and Pots" and one or two people not willing to food up and they get salty when I initiate a kick after I tell them to grab food before we start and and we go ahead and start and they're still not buffed up. 
---
This hasn't been an issue really until recently at least anecdotally for me. But seriously in the last few weeks its been really annoying or i get someone running magic find food for some  stupid reason.
---
Banners in Amnoon?? Nice I'll have to check it out. Thanks!
---
They are looking for people to play with. They want to be in parties. They want to be with groups. They don't know that they are not ready for raids or Arah yet. That Revenant probably thought this "Someone is looking for Renegade. Renegade=Revenant. I am Revenant. Now This Looks Like a Job For Me". And when you ask them weird questions which they don't even understand, they feel too embarrassed to answer and fear they might get trashtalked/blocked/immediately kicked out of the group etc..  
---
When I was new to this game and finally unlocked LFG, first thing I did was join a group for Living World because that sounded most exciting.
---
This. Logan should actually do something useful this time and I'll stop hating him.
---
Right, but if they're upgradeable skins and there's a collection for the base set, it'd make sense to go for medium to unlock first if you're going to get the whole collection eventually
---
This comment made me sad 😢
---
They might be saying hi. But not in your party chat. Next time tell them to use /p before message.
---
I did it on release, i wont go back to that map anytime soon.
---
They were in Draconis Mons for 3 of the collections so far....their month has been ruined. This new bit of information was just the cherry on top.
---
Canach is such a badass. My favorite moment of him is in the intro to HoT senario if you take Meetala's path to fortify the camp. My man ACTUALLY calls Mordremoth's call to Sylvari "like a buzzing fly." What an absolute Chad.
---
Just on the Shadow Nexus, I'm going off the wiki:
---
&gt; The Shadow Nexus is but a single shard of reality left behind by the Five Gods when they imprisoned Abaddon. Once used to control access to his realm, Abaddon has turned their clever scheme upon them and now uses the Nexus to send his foul spawn of Torment to invade other realities.
---
And on the Cauldron -- I reckon that shape is just as iconic as the Wizard's Folly tower -- gonna need to explore Talmark for these pillars, but I doubt it's more utterly distinctive than the Searing Cauldron. Certainly not as important to the narrative. I'd be super surprised if that was a generic asset -- it's a very specific model so I would assume it is a valid implication. 
---
The idea Khilbron manipulated the key lines is perfectly plausible so I'll concede that.
---
hahaha yes that was me ;D just made this character today!
---
thank you!! ;D
---
I find weapon skins the best. Choose the current lot in the BL chests and after they rotate back out the prices go up. Greatswords are almost always a sure bet.
---
I already have a build and have fractals 1-10 cleared. I just wondering if fractals are how you get the best end game gear
---
Against humans sure, an invading army of aliens however....
---
No one ever said it was hard or not doable. It's pretty easy.  
---
  
---
The problem is the absolute borefest of having to complete all 4 renown hearts for sixteen days.  
---
"but you can do it slowly, spreading these days through some time, and it doesn't feel so boring!" yeah except no one does achievements like that. You set your eyes on something and focus on it.
---
Answers are normally under 24 hours... but can take a bit more, I would say just wait an answer back.
---
If you have an actual Confirmation Bill for the purchase, you should include those in the reply. or a Proof of your purchase, if it was done with you, normally with an authification of the payment method, if the Expansions, and the Gems were bought via Paypal, or Credit Card (this infos should suffice).
---
If you still have an open support ticket, try to mention these things to get your account status reinstated. Otherwise, open a new support ticket.
---
Things that will help a lot are transaction references and/or payment information to provide to support to prove that the purchases were indeed legitimate and made yourself.
---
Theres a bug thats been happening to not obly me, but other people as well. When you join a group on lfg, you sometimes join another group on lfg. I joined lws4 map and it added me to another map. Some person joined my raid group when they wanted another open world squad.
---
I know which one. The one where you sabotage an Inquest base. It fucking sucks, and the fact that you have to repeatedly complete it so many times makes it a top contender for worst Heart of season 3
---
I think the helm is the racer one but it might be the sandstorm one. The chest is from the glorious set. I can't tell what the gloves and pants are but the shoulders and boots look generic.
---
Even if I already have all expansions?
---
Thank you I appreciate it
---
  how popular we assume GW2 to be 
---
That's right, people usually only assumes. 
---
Out game is mostly populated by veterans and I highly doubt the advertisement of "11 million strong" is true at all. 11 million players I believe, but ACTIVE players? Come on... There are still people out there who believe this game died months after release or lost all interest when the lay offs came.
---
I want wings
---
I want glowy staff
---
I am firebrand with all my hero points
---
I have unlocked 2/3 Raptors
---
I have unlocked mushrooms and stage 2 on glider 
---
I like raids and have 1-10 fractals cleared. I mostly want to be stronger for raids while looking glamorous lul :)
---
I have, it's just annoying because of sunk cost.
---
The goggles give me a real Man-spride vibe
---
the story is bad. even in the expansions, it's bad, only slightly better because they give you more eye candy and TURN UP THE STAKES because the world is being destroyed at every turn. I experience the story in a second language because then I can focus on building my vocabulary instead of thinking about how bad the writing is.
---

---
For gear, this has always been a nice guide for me.
---
Spoodermon!
---
You can buy the Supreme Runes of Holding from the TP too. While they are only generated via ecto gambling, it can be quite a costly endeavor to get them that way.
---
I hated Draconic Mons. It was the beginning of the decline for me. I never finished all the achievements. I curse every time I have to go to the map for anything.
---
So I tried Samarog for the first time, and did about 8-9k dps? is that an okay dps amount? What value should I am for like 15k+? playing berserker warrior
---
People that only want instant gradification weak in their heads and pathetic in nature. I suggiest trying to put effort in what you do, and that applies to everything not just a silly achievment in a video game.
---
It’s got a nice flax farm!
---
Gloves were in the vendor just before this one, so it’ll probably be a while. I’m really hoping for shoulders next though, been waiting on them.
---
Damn I missed it :/
---
Same here!  The volcano was a slog unlike any other I’d done up to that point.  This poor guy must have thought he was finally done, only to discover the last ach.  From happy to sad in .5 seconds haha!
---
I just wish I hadn’t mapped away so I could have seen what everyone‘s relies were  :)
---
It's different. Waaaay different. I'm currently progging Ultima weapon ultimate in ffxiv and am pretty fresh into gw2 raiding (only two wings cleared 31LI). It's not scripted like ffxiv where at a minute into the fight hello world 1 starts and right after archive peripheral and so on. Boss phases in gw2 from what I experienced so far are more based on boss hp. The mechanics are much less of a choreographed dance like ffxiv is. Ff is more stand here, run there, be here to resolve x and it all happens at specific timestamps in the fight. Progging ff raids is like a rehearsed dance whereas gw2 feels a more on your toes experience and so far I feel like I have to actually learn what's happening with mechanics whereas in ffxiv I cleared o12s probably over a dozen times before I knew what was actually happening during hello world 2. I could go to my spot when I needed to be there and things would work out. I also feel like the few gw2 bosses I've done can be learned in a few hours tho I hear wing 5 and 6 are much harder than the others. Ffxiv obviously requires dozens of hours of prog to clear some fights but it's all about learning the specific strats (dances) until you did it while meeting a dps check. I also feel like with a few exceptions gw2 rotations are much harder to master than ffxiv. I hope this was helpful. Trying to get more gw2 raid experience myself.
---
It wouldn't be that interesting. Being fully healed is already pretty good. And if you don't pick scholar runes as the only fastest speedrun runes then it would be just be some other rune, the next fastest one. So it wouldn't really improve choice at the top level either.
---
Well, I am looking at it specifically as a side game to FFXIV, so that's not so bad for me.
---
Team comps change a lot based on the fight. Some fights have required tanks, some don’t, and some fights have unique rolls for just that fight, like hand the kiter on Deimos. You almost always see at least one dedicated healer (usually a druid, sometimes a tempest, and rarely a revenant) along with some support classes (chronomancer, banner warrior). 
---
As for difficulty, I can’t compare too much because i’ve never raided a lot in any other mmo, but there’s a wide range of boss difficulty. Across all 6 of the current wings, most are fairly challenging, with really important party-wiping mechanics to be on the look out for. Some edge into really difficult, but which bosses are really challenging depends a lot on the kind of player you are, cause each one requires a different skillset. And theres one encounter, called escort, thats pretty much free loot.
---
Also some (but not all) bosses have challenge modes that really ramp up the pressure. Best way to find out if you like it is to try. Learn the mechanics for the wing 1 bosses (wing 1 has a really good mix of execution fights and dps checks) and lfg. I recommend finding a guild you can learn with.
---
It almost certainly will. This is a Big Deal patch
---
Also reminder if you end up getting other tools that are "better" somehow:
---
You can wardrobe skin change gathering tools and get the better part of the tool while keeping the old tool. At least that's how it worked when I changed my sickle to the molten one (fastest gathering animation)
---
Easy savage isn't so bad. I could definitely play a game filled with something similar to EX Trials in difficulty.
---
This is extremely helpful, thanks. I'm sad that GW2 doesn't have the "dance", but I wasn't really expecting it to anyway.
---
2x speed and ez
---
Probably I just **so much** love Edgar Poe.
---
I think I rezzed you when an evil, red circle of poisonous deathy-death appeared at Tequatl a few hours ago!
---
I just had a realization. Ffxiv is like learning a choreographed dance for a ballet recital in a hall whereas gw2 feels more like learning how to dance more casually with a partner(s) at an informal venue. That's how it feels to me anyways lol.
---
Oh no... There's 4? I haven't even gotten myself to start the first.
---
Goodbye, my dreams of Aurora.
---
I guess right now I'm trying to level my crafting as fast as possible so what's the best way to get gold? My materials are running thin after leather and huntsman
---
Thats what happened in jurassic world where the sea behemoth monster thing ate the big big mutant white t rex
---
adding a second greatsword moveset would add variety.
---
No, I didn't I just had a password on. It had back 4 states trusted on it which I removed all of it and I just open a ticket. I still have the cd key when I bought it off of Amazon in 2012 XD
---
Yeah and I hope Krallkatorik suddenly talks to us before he dies and is also voiced by Nolan North.
---
In my experience essentially the entire floor will constantly be cluttered with a menagerie of effects. Its very hard to tell whats happening a lot of the time. You cant move or change your UI so youre stuck with raid frames top left and UI on bottom. There are also no good ways to monitor buffs and debuffs apart from standard UI on the bottom. Boss raid timers aren't really a thing you can get and bosses dont really have a cast bar for abilities. Its really weird.
---
There used to be the chrono csplit trick that soloed this easily, but they've since patched that, so it doesn't work the same way portals don't work.
---
Your best bet now might be (if you're trying to solo it, which it sounds like you are) getting a thief with shadowstep + shortbow. Pick up the bag, throw it immediately, while it's in the air shadowstep to where it will land, then rinse and repeat.
---
Error Code 7 says that there are general issues connecting to the game server.
---
That doesn't, or most likely doesn't, mean that it is a problem with the game server because there is an issue on the route from your network to the game servers in which you have package loss that the server is then not accepting and kicking you out.
---
Use ping plotter or WINMTR to check the route to the game servers IP (with /ip when you are in the game) and see if you have package loss.
---
If the package loss starts at a host with arena.net then it is a game server issue, if not then it is an ISP issue.
---
Impressive work! The backpack is a great addition.
---
The legendary greatsword out of the 'improvised weapon skin set' to repair those imrovised weapons...
---
Shit son, you don't need advice. Just hit up metabattle and figure out a FB raid build. Boon/ quickness FB seems to be popular.
---
That is so lovely I am happy to see such things in our community. I do sometimes share cookies. :D
---
Dungeons in FF XIV = harder than gw2 raids
---
But what's a curse word? Damn isn't a curse word, it's used in game all the time. You say it once, banned.
---
You're trying to argue "It isn't all bad!" If the SE GM's were actually good the game wouldn't have the rep of being the special snowflake safe MMO. 
---
You lost this dude, sit the fuck down.
---
its just how reddit works, donald
---
This is amazing! Love the title choice also! Great job!
---
New mesmer spec, T*he Stripper.*
---
It will be my first year as well, and I am honestly extremely excited!! Really an amazing initiative!

Uh, you reckon? Killing Abaddon in The Mists released enough magic into Tyria to kick-start the rise of the Elder Dragons in the first place. This is more like releasing the magic of one and two sixths of an Elder Dragon, plus the better part of a Bloodstone and a God. I'm not as optimistic
---
Guardian and mesmer both have proactive defence styles. Guardians use aegis and blocks and mesmers use evades and block, basically. A lot of it is about timing.

Have fun!

Liked bard style classes so I had to make the minstrel. Sadly don't use it to much on my main anymore.
---
Nothing comes close to the hearts of Lake Doric.  Though my least favorite heart for DM is the mercenaries - the named enemies can be a real hassle, especially if you're not looking out for them.
---
think it says quite a lot how casual gw2 community is. just wow....
---
Been gone for like 4 years, and I bought the HoT before I left and never finished. Now I kinda wanna get back into it and started again. So is the Silverwaste runs all dead now? I don't see any LFG instances for it anymore
---
And I kinda assume no one does dungeons anymore either
---
Should I just start doing HoT storymode and then PoF stories too? The Silverwaste meta event was pretty fun, are the new ones like Dragon's Stand the same equivalent people are doing now?
---
It's funny, I usually dislike grindy/farmy stuff, but I really enjoyed thus one just because DM is such a fantastic map =)
---
Get exotic armor/weapons with the right stats for your build (check metabattle). Ascended rings for laurels, fractals  or living world currencies (if you have LS3 bitterfrost frontier is the best). Infuse or attune them asap for easy AR. Get accessories with laurels/LW, and a backpack from PoF achievements (raise the banners). This should get you enough AR for T1/T2. Always slot in +9 infusions or below, anything more is inefficient.
---
Climbing to T3 will take a while; level your armor weight's crafting profession with the gold from fractals, and start doing daily crafts. By the time you need more AR, you should have enough gold+daily crafts to make ascended armor. 
---
For raids, exotics+ascended trinkets should be enough. Find a training guild and just practice ;)
---
None of the quickness firebrand builds - which would most likely be played alongside a Renegade - use Renegade runes.
---
That's so sweet, thank you &lt;3
---
Just get anything that's modern. GTX 10X0 or better. Intel 8X00 or better. DDR4 8-16GB or More  
---
It's all about your budget. Get the best thing you can with what  you can afford
---
Not soon enough
---
Wait, free? It costs 1k unbound magic, so you'd wound up paying like 60k unbound magic which is insane.
---
It's been almost 4 years
---
Saying raids are easy gives a very wrong idea of what raids are and I would really like a clear source on GW2 having the easiest raids because I really do not believe it in the slightest.
---
Were that true, we'd have more raiders even with a slow release pace and composition wouldn't matter so much.
---
The best part about GW2 raiding, which makes it better than any other MMOs raiding, is there's always a reason to do it. You'll always need gold bby.  
---
Now if they'd only do CM for every single fight and make it another difficulty with it's own weekly lockout rather than a one-and-done. This game would be dankosaurus.
---
1. Yes, unless you leave the map. However, events int he expansions are different. You might lose participation if you don't contribute to the event for some time.
---
2. Can't tell, never used the GPS. But if it only points towards undetected locations: sure why not.
---
3. Doing personal story and hitting level 80 - where the game really starts - are good goals for now.
---
4. Map completion is character dependend. Your alt will have to do map comp all over again. The alt friendliness is due to the horizontal gear progression. You don't have to treadmill all day to get better gear. Ascended gear is the best stat-wise and will never be "outdated".
---
Probably because, while this is informational, the meta changes all the time so it's best not to decide what class to roll purely on what's most OP right now.
---
Ah you're right, I forgot the most meta one since it lacks a benchmark (due to it being focused on confusion stacks). Thanks for pointing that out.
---
You can post an advertisement in https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildRecruitment
---
I tried but no one responded
---
as a former rs member i can confirm this. its caused to weird upscaling on a 21 thief which is purely build around power. together with buffs from the subgroup it gets amazing damage ticks. i dont know exact numbers, but without might one shot of the duneroller reduced a veteran guards life to 30%. 
---
that beeing said, its a wellknown issue, so anet should fix it or more ppl should use it to pressure a solution.
---
Honestly wait a month. Amd is releasing new processors most likely at the end of this month and from what the leaks are telling us they will have way higher clock speeds, thread counts and core count than current Intel ones.
---
Incredible work!

That stuff is easy, farming karma for when you need it, is hard

She was weakened by an attack prior from one of Mordremoth's champions and placed in a vegetative state (heh) prior to Mordremoth corrupting the Dream.
---
To have fun with others? To be social?
---
Not every clan/guild needs a purpose outside of simply, having fun together.
---
PvP had more attention than WvW back when proleague was going on I think.
---
Yeah there are many that have been accused of things like account sharing, ddosing, etc such as Frostball, Blackjack and so on. Too many to count almost, really.
---
Yeah, that's cute.
---
git gud, become a legend so ppl beg to join. start by leading runs, get a good name as a commander, climb the leadership ladder and offer to teach others how to do it.
---
get a guild hall and provide services that would entice ppl to join, like the tavern for buffs, farming nodes and vendors.
---
if you cant afford this, join another guild, recruit into it, run as a commander. you dont have to have youre own guild, just piggy back off someone elses, they might make you an officer or offer joint leadership.

"All the way" to 17?

You what, auto attacked with a dagger for 29 minutes and came to the conclusion it doesn't get any better in the next 63 levels?
---
Aren't Snowcrows's builds updated pretty frequently?
---
Says you.
---
GW2 raids have kept my attention way longer than XIVs ever did.
---
Been playing thief as my main open world character since launch. Feels pretty good.
---
More like:
---
Taimi: "I found this stick, and turns out it kills Kralk in 1 hit."
---
And then GW3 rings the door!
---
What exactly you hated except Druid collection and JP here?
---
i spent over a thousand hours on my thief, but can barely play elementalist for over an hour at a time. so idk anymore !
---
&gt;The best part about GW2 raiding, which makes it better than any other MMOs raiding, is there's always a reason to do it. You'll always need gold bby.
---
In all mmos(ffxiv/gw2 included) you can sell raid clears.
---
She was blessed by the gods so that she could become a god. Normal humans cannot just absorb a bunch of magic and be fine, and we don't know what that blessing actually did to her other than allow her to absorb magic safely and become a god.
---
Besides all that, the magic Kormir absorbed is different from Tyria's magic as shown how the Elder Dragons have repeatedly had issues corrupting and consuming magic from the Mists (Forgotten and divine magic) - only Kralkatorrik has been able to corrupt this magic (as shown with the djinn which used remnant magic from Abaddon for protection against the brand), and that's only after consuming Balthazar's released magic.
---
All of this, however, is besides the point ultimately, since my point was that if the gods and former gods could replace the Elder Dragons in the All, then there was no point in antagonizing Balthazar during Flashpoint (and yes, we *did* antagonize him; had we allied with him, the Forged would not have been made, and he might have had a chance to be redeemed).
---
Name me a few games where there is a possibility to buy gems (premium currency) with gold and vice versa.

and then dies because of her illness.
---
you heard it first here
---
It's also a thing for many guilds in wvw.
---
Now I can agree when I first made my thief I *hated* it. My first character was a Ranger, so playing a thief was a big flip for me. 
---
But oh boy as soon as I unlocked Daredevil thief instantly became my main. I had mobility, I had evasion, I had damage and I had pretty good CC. 
---
That was ~2-3 years ago. I’ve now maxed a mesmer and a mesmer and honestly *most* classes are boring in the start. 
---
Get them to lvl 80, get an meta build and then make a judgement call. Or just play any build really, as long as you’re enjoying it. But lvl 17 is *way* to low to make a decision to say the least.
---
Try taking them to pvp to see what they are like at lvl 80, you will have access to all your skills and traits and can play about in the pvp lobby.
---
It's really tiring to move my index finger all the way over to the 3 key
---
I have full bags of purple crafting material from 80lvl locations and I have no idea what to use them for.
---
Also Mithril, elder wood, silk and eyes of Kormir.
---
I am running out of inventory and bank space quickly because it cannot be sold. Also I have Jewelcrafting (400), Weaponsmith (440), armorsmith (420), huntsman (440), Tailor (430) and Leatherworking (400).
---
Is there any way I can turn it into gold or easy equipment? I have now 6 characters with exotic gear and weapons from collections, with accesories from story achievs but missing out on Runes, I dont have any proper set on any character.
---
I just started
---
Thanks!
---
Haha, yeah that's true, but 0-80 is the time when we actually need to be active and use other skills. It's endgame when we get to stand still and auto :P
---
You have a couple options, you can convert the Obsidian Refinement materials into their [refined form](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodstone_Brick) to be used in mainly [vision crystals](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vision_Crystal) for ascended crafting. Your other main option is to use a [converter](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Converter) to turn the resources into random loot. I'd suggest making at least a couple of the refined materials before getting converters but that depends on how much you plan on using, the refinement materials aren't all that hard to come by. I'd suggest looking into what you want to do with your characters and following a [guide on gearing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) or looking at a [general guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Start_Here).
---
So the purple material is only to feed those gizmos? It is not used for anything else?
---
I stay in Asia and I join the NA server.
---
But this was not about instant gratification. It was about a person believing they had finished only to find out more needed to be done. 
---
This person is merely taken aback by the situation, but if you want to imply that being bummed out you thought you were done with an achievement equals being a weak minded person who is subsequently pathetic in their convictions across all spectrums of life, then by all means act a fool.
---
For WvW/PvP you need to be a commander or someone people want to follow before you can start your own guild. That means running as a commander.
---
For OCE and Asian players, many of them are on NA servers and have dedicated communities revolving around that. I'm not sure about EU but I've heard their downtimes are more dramatic whereas NA has lower peak population but spread more, especially during off-peak timezones including OCE and SEA.

and glitter!
---
We had an expack with Sylvari background and one with Human background. Far Shiverpeaks is a good bet for the other races. Norn Homelands and old Rata Sum. Or Charr Homelands, which are also kinda northy, which could connect
---
I agree. I thought about it being problematic in terms of forcing players to play certain specs for certain skills but in the same time it seemed interesting enough so it might work with the right skills and synergies.
---
Yeah, mentioned that in my edited section.
---
&gt; I want wings

Conceptually, a raid consists of several 10-man trials connected with the in-between bits of a 24 player alliance raid.
---
Username checks out.
---
No sane person is going to buy a clear for Shiva EX though.
---
Old Rata Sum? Do you mean Rata Novus in Tangled Depths?
---
Probably non nativ speaker used the wrong translation of achievement
---
Yeah, divine origin was needlessly vague of me -- he corrupts the uh, magically imbued locations of other divinities. Fair points, though.
---
On the uh, "portal access", it seems like part of the um, fallen god process, is getting your Mistwalker powers revoked. Balthazar couldn't port out until he jumpstarted himself with Sohothin, too. Never really thought about that in relation to the Shadow Nexus though -- why would the Gods need a shard of reality to control access? Maybe it was to bring in all of the Forgotten jailors?
---
On the variety of cauldrons; I'm gonna need to replay Borlis Pass. Do you mean the Storm Beacons listed on the wiki? And while the uh, spikey cauldron might have just been whatever old Bonfaaz had on hand at the time, it seems like that specific construction is considered to be the canonical "this is going to ruin your day" cauldron design as of GW2, judging by the similar one(s?) near Khilbron's tower in the Straits of Devastation. Not saying it's a unique artifact, but the specific structure seems to be purposeful - and unless the Charr took the long way around when invading Orr, it's very odd seeing that design in the Crystal Outlook.
---
And that’s not a bad thing.
---
You can try other modes, both in WvW and PvP you would get plenty of AP starting off because the milestones are less at the start.
---
Apart from that you can create an account on gw2efficiency website and give your API, it will help you track what AP you already have and what you can get.
---
Hahaha, I had the same reaction. Luckily I am obsessed with doing achievements that I just kept smacking it day after day for dunno how long. 2-3 weeks?
---
Grind Wars 2? Buddy have you tried Black Desert Online? \*Cough cough\* I meant Grind Desert Online.
---
No I mean the underground City the Asura came from before the Destroyers expelled them to the surface
---
Repeat that 10+ times and you have a summary of LS4. Cant wait till Taimi dies so we can actually be something else then Taimi's assistent.

You are from Earth.

Yeah that's on Earth dipshit. What are you hustling on us for?
---
I recently did this collection after not visiting Draconis Mons since it launched. DM has grown on me and it's actually a really cool map. The daily hearts are easy and it takes 10mins - I don't know why people complain about this, and there's usually people to help with champion events for the other parts of the collection, especially on weekends. If it's the timegate that's triggering you remember you can still go do the other LS3 achievements/masteries while doing this in the background.
---
Where did they give a release date?
---
This is exactly why I bought my first bank expansion tab. I wasn't allowed to use the Trading Post, I didn't know what salvaging was, and I didn't know what was worth anything. I had bank tabs full of mediocre gear and literal junk. And I bought a bank expansion tab because the game didn't explain this stuff to me.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
LS4 maps let you collect volatile magic, which you can use to purchase Trophy Shipments. They drop a mixture of T5 and T6 trophies. You can upgrade T5 to T6 in the mystic forge at a rate of about 50:7.

Flipping dyes is like flipping any other item, you buy one cheap and sell it expensive.
---
Gambling unid dyes =/= flipping.
---
I hope that they will focus more on minor races such as Dredge or even Tengu.
---
Rata Sum has always been in Magumma.
---
We may head east next. They expanded the map a lot with PoF. Here's the link to the world map.

My theory is that we will kill Kralkatorrik in the Mists to avoid another magic leak in Tyria. This will, however, bite us in the butt later on. We need to remember that Kralkatorrik is now able to open portals between the Mists in Tyria. If he is killed and his magic spreads in the Mists, some entities, even old GW1 vilians and heroes may absorb his magic and come back to Tyria again using his magic and open more portals. Some fractal loops can be broken as well, so the assets can be reused. 
---
I would like to see revival of old gw1 charr enemies from Ascalon times, their leaders and maybe even Khan-Ur. Also it would be nice to bring Charr ghosts from the Mist so ghosts of ascalon have more fun in the War Eternal they've already led. Rytlock, as revenant, could help to deal with the problem to send revived invaders back to the Mists.
---
In this season we've had new charr tribe in Elona and also some hints about Rytlock's cubs. I hope we will visit Charr Lands next season.
---
HAHA thank you! this comment made my day XD
---
Kudzu was the only one I really liked, I just loved the 3d flower trails and growing plants on people when shot. It also has all these nice falling leaves and petals effects when drawn. 
---
I saved up for it over the course of 2 years while waiting for a pre drop since this was before the change to legendaries, finally dropped from the mystic forge and was able to make it.
---
I’m currently going for either Sunrise/Eternity or the new gradesword, hard to choose.
---
Unleash the lawyers!
---
For EU vs NA regions, it depends. I think generally people are playing on NA servers but EU servers are better at peak time, so if you can play EU peak times then EU servers might be fun as well.
---
Even coming to NA, it is not an easy choice to pick what server you want to be on. It totally depends on what you want to achieve with your guild or yourself. To that end, I'd suggest if you want to move, find a group you'd like to run with at first on NA during your time zone; and *don't be afraid* to jump around and try out different guilds or servers until you find one that you truly enjoy. That's the easiest way to build a group up, by understanding your timezone on your server and then seeing how you can make people come play with you and what you offer.
---
The alternative is taking a crap shoot and just tag as a dedicated commander at fixed times every week, for months on end, until you start to pick up traction. This is a long grind but the most organic way to start a guild. It will be very difficult if you don't already know a lot about the game mode. If you are a veteran/experienced player or returning veteran with some idea of how the game is played, then you might be able to do a bit better.
---
will try to find a way to bring my char there! :D
---
thanks man! ;)
---
Thanks:) this is what I wanted to know 
---
Also how much per hour are those currency runs?
---
Yea, you gotta' choose Path of Fire and then add Heart of Thorns as a bundled item.
---
Is it to late to get into it? I bought the base game on launch but never played much of it. Now they have all these expansions..
---
So we basically create a Bad Dragon to pleasure kralk with?
---
Lol, the higher level content remark is even true even on higher level content, on T1 fractals everyone is super supportive and gladly explains and as you get up people can get a bit more grumpy as they expect more out of you.
---
The idea is to watch enemy animations to identify attacks. 
---
This thread is really interesting to someone who never raided outside of ge2.
---
Down and death in FF14 are still very different IMO in terms of how people react. Downed state means res now or lose forever in GW2. Death in FF14 means res whenever possible but no direct penalty for not immediately doing it.
---
Guessing hes french or spanish
---
Let me guess. You didn't liked Tangled Depths as well?
---
Look at the username...
---
Get out, grandpa

When I see the photos from this article [http://www.buffed.de/Guild-Wars-2-Spiel-17072/News/Termin-Ewiger-Krieg-Episode-1281572/galerie/3011306/](http://www.buffed.de/Guild-Wars-2-Spiel-17072/News/Termin-Ewiger-Krieg-Episode-1281572/galerie/3011306/), especially the one with meteors in the sky and the burnt tree, I really think we're going to where Kralk was asleep in GW1. It also makes sense another article said the map was linked to Kralk's existence, or something like that.
---
So yeah Charr Homelands is a good guess
---
level 1 - 19 in fractals is basically being in the starter area of the game, killing some trash mobs. really easy, but a good start neverless, just keep going until you hit the wall called tier 3.
---
I know. I don't want to sound like a dick but I don't care that you got world completion or that you got a legendary. I see people walking around with them in game and don't stop to be excited about it. It's really cool for you and I'm happy for you, but it's not interesting to anyone who doesn't know you. I don't like it when game subs get flooded with that kind of stuff. The no man's sky subreddit is completely dominated by "look at my new ship!" posts and dumb stuff like that. I don't care about your new ship. I'm here to see interesting things relating to this game.
---
Oh right, my bad, I mean hearts.
---
In that case, look for other things you can do to progress the heart, or other areas with monsters - hearts are usually pretty big.
---
Unless you're buying ALL the ascended jeweler's items, you don't need unbound often. Some people opt to use the unbound magic slappy axe thingy to passively get it over time.
---
Not his post, OP's title. Unless Angeleremite means something?
---
I meant it more like there's nothing to prevent people from being dumb and not reading the LFG.
---
Well if they're nearby in open world and don't say anything in /s /m /p, where are they talking ? To their guild ? Even being new doesn't excuse everything at this point. Even new players have a right to think.
---
I've had little luck with that, things like collecting stuff on the ground barely progress the hearts most of the time.
---
I say this a lot, but I'll repeat it again here...heart are not he quests in this game. In this game, dynamic events are the quests. Hearts didn't even exist in the first two betas. They were added to the game to get people to hang around in areas where events spawn. That's why when you go to Orr, the end game zones, all three zones have no hearts, only events.  Same with all three zones introduced before the first expansion, Southsun, Dry Top and Silverwastes. No hearts. Same with the entire first expansion. Four zones, no hearts.  Hearts were added again after due to some players wanting more solo/easy/casual stuff to do. Many people can't stand them.
---
The good news is, there's no reason to do hearts, until you want world/map completion. They're not particularly a fast way to level. They're not every rewarding, and very often, events incidentally fill them in anyway.
---
I tend to ignore most hearts, or only do them very casually. What I do instead is look for events, the orange markers on your map. Orange skull is a boss event. Orange basket is a collection event. Orange shield is a protection/escort event. Orange circle denotes an event boundary. 
---
You can open your big map and look for events, or they appear on your minimap if you're close enough.  
---
To give you an example of why I said hearts aren't the quests, this game launched with 303 hearts...it launched with over 1500 dynamic events.
---
I don't know.  I just saw multiple posts the last few days saying they only got one code when ordering both, and wondering if it was a mistake.  Others responded that it this is normal.
---
I don't know if this is just when ordering the "collection", or also happens when you add-on HoT.
---
Also, since that post was made 4/26/19, it should be 2 months from then correct?
---
Haven't been able to find much else though.. a few events from time to time.
---
I don't think that's true. I've done full world completion (which means all Hearts, everywhere) 10 times, and have not found this to be the case.
---
The skeletons in the effect (zoom in closely) have skulls which look vaguely like a Roswell Grey.
---
Around noonish EST? I don't really remember, I'm sure someone else will come by and give you a more precise answer. Also yes, there is two months between linkings.
---
Thanks for the info, appreciate ya!
---
Mesmer is the best in every single mode shortly followed by ranger with a big gap, then everything else is somehow more balanced.
---
Hey, not that i want to transfer myself right now, but thanks for sharing this info good to know!
---
Alright, my bad. Thanks for all the info. I'm not having much luck with anything, even events, but I'm somewhat low-level right now anyway.
---
There are a lot of different activities that require different things and thus this is impossible to say. On top of this - and as you yourself stated - these things tend to change quite a bit.  
---
There are still trends of sorts and classes that are stronger or weaker in particular tasks (Ele tends to outclass most other classes on PvE, Big hitbox, DPS checks, but hasnt been part of the PvP meta for high rank sPvP matches for some time), but if you are on level 20 right now chances are that a lot changes before you reach the point where these things become relevant and in Story, Open world, Dungeons, low-midlvl fractals, mid-lvl sPvP you can play any class you want.

If you're on a US server, I can help show you the game. Hit me up on Vayne.8563. If you're a  free account, you'll have to message me here so I can friend you or you won't be able to whisper me.
---
Saw you at Mt Maelstrom. Nicely done.
---
Maybe on a static golem, but not everywhere else.
---
Mesmer &amp; Guardian, overall.  Strong personal damage builds, useful elite specializations and plenty of utility for PvE &amp; PvP/WvW.
---
Oh! that makes more sense.
---
PVP, WvW, Personal Story when available and Dungeons when you hit a high enough level for them all level you up. Just exploring the world and discovering new locations will as well. 
---
There are some guides in the sidebar which explain what ways there are to get to the level cap without going mad doing hearts. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/newplayers
---
Aion lived longer than I'd expect it to without a proper sequel, which apparently it'll never get. Lineage likewise. NCSoft is 'failing' because they refuse to do what they need to to hold a decent market share in the PC MMO space. :P
---
Hearts aren't really quests. They're fillers for when events aren't active.
---
Seems lile comtacting support just to be sure is the better option. Thank you!!
---
Ohh that reminds me of the weapon skins I bought before going hiatus myself, their gold worth should have raised by a lot by now. Also, congrats on your gold!
---
Ok at this point it's legit to report you for spamming.
---
Yep, if you get the double pack HoT/PoF on sale right now it comes as one code. That one code unlocks both expansions + the two max level boosters.   
---
You can 'gift' the whole thing to someone else but you can't split it in two or anything.
---
It's a guild hall decoration too if your guild has it unlocked
---
I doubt the map will be expanded until an expansion, so we have few choices within the current maps:
---
https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/
---
Some approximate space left in number of possible new maps that could fit there:
---
* Heart of Maguuma: 1 map, 1 small map.
---
* Maguuma Wastes: ~5 maps.
---
* Janthir: ~5 maps
---
* Orr: ~ 2 maps
---
* Northern Shiverpeaks: ~5 maps.
---
* Southern Shiverpeaks: 1 maps, ~2 small maps.
---
* The Charr Homelands: &gt; 20 maps.
---
* Blazeridge Mountains: &gt; 5 maps.
---
* Crystal Desert: &gt; 11 maps. 
---
* Dzalana: &gt; 10 maps.
---
* Unending Ocean: &gt; 30 maps.
---
Since the most space other than underwater seems to be in the Charr Homelands, and underwater combat has been mostly deprecated, chances are we'll end up there, if they do not expand the map.
---
I might be missing something, so sorry if I am.
---
But "Nightfall" can be set to autocast in game.
---
I hate afk farming with a passion and I **personally** think it should be a bannable offense. But the devs have specifically said that if you are able to respond if they message you it's sufficient proof that you arent fully afk and then it is fine.
---
I also believe you straight up broke one of the rules by the subreddit, as follows:
---
"Witch-hunting is trying to get someone punished for something illegal they have done without a proper proof. Currently only accepted proof is unedited video, but doesn't guarantee the post will be allowed. Moderators will asses the proof and can determine it inefficient.
---
If you do not have proper proof, remove the character and player name as well as the guild tag. If you do not follow these rules your post/comment will be removed until you have edited them to fit these rules. If the name is in the title, the post must be reposted without it."
---
So report him in game and dev's will take a look at him sooner or later, if he isn't fully afk it's fine. Otherwise he will be dealt with, just dont take your witch hunt to the sub.
---
Story in GW2 isn’t just delivered via cutscene, the best I stories I think are often told through ambient dialogue or environmental story telling. Definitely consider exploring with full sounds and an open mind
---
I hope they don’t expand the map but instead fill in the gaps.
---
It turns into a scythe for reapers though
---
Literally the song I blast as I drive to work ahahah
---
I loved that bit where she helps you during that fight! It was so good.
---
I imagine there's some sort of moment where the two talk about things between scenes. I'd love to see the Commander and Caithe have a real heart-to-heart discussion, but it might be better off-screen. But that aside, despite focusing so much on her thoughts regarding her relationships, especially with Faolain, I think there was plenty of material there to demonstrate the bond between Caithe and Aurene. She goes into detail about how much she's grown, and the pain she endured for much of her life. How she's learned to love because of Aurene, which is exactly what I was hoping would happen when Caithe volunteered to stay and watch over her all those years ago.
---
I now headcanon that eventually she will talk about this with the Commander (specifically I headcanon her talking about it with my female Sylvari Commander, since I ship them together).
---
And what do I take from it? That death is not death because it actually DOES inspire people? What is death, then?
---
Man, I remember Guild Wars 2 years ago had a ton of bots. At times, I saw more bots roaming around the Human world than actual people -- just mindlessly forming bot-trains as they kill random enemies.   
---
Guessing OP could have accidentally been a part of that wave when they left and their account got compromised. :/
---
Lol, I just finished that last night! The hardest part for me was the timing of the final boss fights. I was never around when they happened.
---
But I'm happy today!
---
Finally, he's barred from this comic.
---
I came from XIV too. To give you a baseline, the core story there I felt was just serviceable. Heavensward, however, I felt was really good. With that in mind, to compare it to GW2, don't. Don't play this game for it's story, I doubt you'll end up satisfied.  
---
All of it is bad, in every way it could have been bad. Bad writing, bad pacing, bad dialogue. The plot has an air about it like it thinks it's game of thrones, but in actuality it's about as strong as a saturday morning cartoon. Many times they'll approach a somewhat interesting idea, but it's ruined because the antagonist is always a mustache twirling unambiguously bad guy.  
---
Do yourself a favor and watch the season 1 video posted around this thread. If you don't end up feeling borderline offended by what they expect you to take seriously as a story, maybe you'll be able to find some enjoyment in the rest. Otherwise, I urge you to try not to care about it.
---
Yeah, that would be great, but to me, filling in the gaps felt kind of "forced" in LWS3? Like, we suddenly went to Lake Doric, then to the Fire Islands, then to Orr, it didn't feel that cohesive :/
---
Looked it up, I suppose that's true for hardcore groups like SC.
---
Personally though, I'd rather stay safe with firebrand runes especially for pugs and more casual groups, and to help patch up errors.
---
They still haven't fixed that lens flare? Wow.
---
I'm new to gw2 and I won't join a random group for any specific thing unless I have watched and read guides on what I am grouping up for and that is something everybody should know lol
---
&gt; And what do I take from it?
---
It's poetry so it's for your own interpretation. In context of what happened in last episode, it's more a question to the team, what we do now that we lost Aurene. Anet is basically copying Avengers Infinity War/Endgame with the tone and the very core concept of the finale.
---
&gt; What is death, then?
---
The answer to this question could be taken from Game of Thrones, where Sam said that death is to be forgotten.
---
&gt; Or that there are things, like death, that just don't have anything good about them but exist anyway so they have to be accepted?
---
This is basically hakuna matata philosophy.
---
I took it as "death is not the end if it inspires people to have new beginnings", not so much anything supernatural, more like "live your life as if death didn't matter"
---
Because WoW and FFXIV and god knows how many other gear treadmill MMOs taught them that you're there to clear the content so shut the fuck up and get to work.
---
I love playing it because of the flow. 
---
For a Condi Renegade: Swapping legend+weapon every 10s allows us to engage in a dps rotation in smaller chunks rather than a bigger whole.
---
Renegade also brings a lot of support to their teams in PvE. Namely Alacrity and Lifesteal. 
---
Heal Renegade has really good healing output. They are only held back by the lack of active damage mitigation or rez skills.
---
Power Herald is also cool. Can help bring boons to the table in situations that otherwise lack. Great for open world.
---
Shiro Legend is just plain damn fun to play, and amazing in both power and condi builds.
---
Unless the party leader tells them what to do and they aren't cooperating...
---
If you aren't already, try using a [crafting guide](http://gw2crafts.net/) to keep your costs down.  Depending on the material you could hunt for it directly, or farm silverwastes for gold (*if* you open bags on a level 40-60 character - look for sw guides).
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Colors are like this (make locked ones hidden) already so there is already foundation made to extend it for armors as well.
---
Did you try to proof a point by not reading that?
---
If you people remember you after you die, and do great things because of you are you really completely dead?  You are still having an impact on the world.
---
If you spend your entire life locked in a safe room and never risk doing anything or interacting with anyone are you really alive?  What's the difference between that room and a coffin?
---
Some people make a bigger difference with/after their death than others make with their entire lives.
---
Dear god no. Aquatic zones are ALWAYS the worst.
---
Unless your main is heavy/light class and you would rather equip them asap than some ranger you left on wood farm near Pagga's waypoint.
---
I mean don't forget that the game is almost 10 years old. Could very well be the game will just "shut down" in terms of development before we even get to the the underwater dragon.
---
wha'ts the average gold per hour? Last somoene told me about this he was making between 30~60
---
I thought we will think about possible new mechanics.
---
Anyway, I'll post mine.
---
Ele don't really have any mana related mechanics. There could be some kind of elemental charges maybe or some new way to use old overcast from gw1. Maybe mantra like abilities that can be used many time but when we cast it too often they start to hinder our stats. Maybe class mechanics that gives things like thief initiative. We can use it to vast with no CD but if we use half of it, it starts to regenerate slower or gets temporary capped.
---
Necro. We need more ways to use shroud. Using it as a pure fuel for dps skills or enhancing them would be nice.
---
Warrior. Warrior needs more weapons we don't have. He could get two additional F skills to choose an exotic weapon kit, so he can use for example spears or two handed axes. On the other hand, he will loose second weapon slot so he can have one physical and two from kits. Also, he could get traits that modify access to F skills. Let's say grandnaster will select him those two available kits depending what he will pick. Ninja, with shuriken and nunchako? Nice.
---
Thief have no support. No ideas what could be good enough. Maybe they will come with some new and fresh ideas like holismith was. 
---
Also, they tested new tech allowing them to replace skills using traits. This allow to make elite spec that will overhaul weapon skills or maybe utilities as well. They not only change effects but skill icon and graphics are changed too.
---
It's about luck really:-)
---
I gave up on those after harvesting probably at least 100 mussels and not seeing a single pearl
---
Renegade or Chrono can rip boons more efficiently than warrior, I'd only take spellbreaker for molten boss or sirens reef, since aoe boon rip is extremely strong there.
---
*i know but please dont talk about gw2 dying, i'm not ready to accept this is a legitimate argument, i'm just gonna ignore this fact and keep on wishing we go to cantha one day alright*
---
It's still a dance, if your DPS is consistent, think of it like a11s and phase skipping stuff with dps. If your dps is consistent you will almost always get the same mechanics at similar timestamps, but if you go lower or higher you might as well be doing a different fight.
---
There's a bit more of random targeting because there are no actual role mechanics, excluding the main tank which can't be targeted by a bunch of mechanics, most of the time if a mechanic isn't random people will define who will deal with it beforehand. It's much more of a dance than people make it out to be, but being so easy to recover from mistakes because the healing threshold is very low in most fights and "raising" is free as long as someone isn't permadead makes it so that things go weird sometimes as this usually makes the script invalid as people shift to adjust, but this also happens in FFXIV, mostly in ex-trials as in savage things usually just explode if you miss an important mechanic.
---
and if you do it wrong you have to do the JP 3 times.
---
if you have a mesmer. use him at that JP.
---
I used to always recommend using the 80 boost for Rev because of this.  Now that they've added [Ancient Echo](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ancient_Echo) it should be a little better, but still tougher than the other classes.
---
yes the map is good. i cant unterstand the hate it gets.
---
/r/whoosh
---
lmao this subreddit is the only place where a post will have 55 comments but literally 2 upvotes
---
That and 
---
#Reviving animations.
---
Imagine summoning an angelic figure or like a cosmic beam falling down on the downed character etc etc
---
Great video and welcome to the community!
---
Ranger doesn't even exist in WvW and hardly in sPvP, not sure what you mean by every single mode
---
Is the reviving animation bound to the player who revives or the one who is revived? Like the system with he mail carriers, which are bound to the one who sends the mail (or receives, if you are buying from the trading company).
---
Thank you (^__^)/
---
Arabic and Cyrillic are not supported in GW2 (witch is Anet choice btw, since trading post support it). So some people cant even communicate through chat.
---
I use Smokescale &amp; Jaracaanda for my soulbeast.
---
The Jara is a great 'oh shit I need healing' backup. 
---
Smokescale is just and awesome model with a built in seven-sided strike. Kinda neat
---
Thank you for confirming it!
---
I will message them. I hope I get a positive answer.
---
There's a bit on the side of this reddit that has a wiki with links to useful information and guides. The expansions are enjoyable, as are the dlcs(living world). I've gone through the stories for both expansions and I'm currently playing through the LWS3 while collecting bits for ascended gear. Finding a profession you click with is really important for this game, more so than warcraft I think. Take your time messing with each one and different weapons before picking a main. Have fun too.
---
&gt; I often stab people I recently stripped infront of.
---
That's a risk I'm willing to take.
---
&gt; good beginner advice
---
Learn to dodge, hearts are not the same thing as quests and are not good at giving exp, pretty much everything you do gives exp, and again, learn how to dodge. Facetanking is not a thing you can do in this game under most circumstances; some builds can withstand it a little bit more, but none are really meant to just stand there and soak up all the damage
---
&gt;are the dlcs worth?
---
Yes
---
There's two types you need, 
---
the expansions: large content packs that introduce completely new mechanics like mounts and gliding, maps, and elite specializations,
---
The living world: smaller periodically released content packs that introduce new maps and masteries, which add on to the mechanics that already exist in game
---
Both are for level 80, the living world continues the story in between expansions and transitions between the expansions, in the order
---
Base game-&gt;season 1 (currently can't play anymore)-&gt;season 2-&gt;Heart of Thorns-&gt;season 3-&gt;Path of Fire-&gt;season 4 (finishing up)-&gt;season 5 (announced)
---
The living world comes out in episodes that you can get for free if you're online during the release window (3 month period until the next episode), otherwise you have to pay to buy them, but this can be done in game. The expansions have to be bought for real money, so look for a sale (I believe there's one right now)
---
Again, level 80 mostly, and if you only want to buy some of them at first, I'd start with the expansions, and then seasons 3 and 4, and then season 2
---
&gt;I was a rly good and skilled player in wow
---
This game isn't WoW, so don't come in with thinking that it is just WoW reskinned. The basics of MMOs will be the same, like experience, HP, levels, etc, but the games are very different experiences overall.
---
Unsubscribe.
---
Power herald is a blast to play in PVP. High risk, high reward, and heavily based on reflexive play. It’s the new thief (rip thief) 
---
Renegade is a visual spectacle and all the skills have such a visceral feeling to it. Moreover, it has such a good package of utilities that make any fractal fight a breeze.
---
Now, you can run fractals in power, condi, and healing so rev has several builds to choose from which can be edited based on the situation. I’m a sucker for jack-of-all-trades classes.
---
Also, raining Disco balls and unicorns. I don’t
---
Think I need to say anymore.
---
what we need is weapon dye channels :D
---
Mallyx / kalla or Mallyx / Shiro*
---
To be fair, Rev is the most dead brain class in open world. You just upkeep a skill then auto attack.
---
The condi and healing variants are a lot of fun to play, and in PVP modes, you’ll definitely get a kick out of playing rev.
---
shiro is not a good legend for condi rev, it is geared towards power dps builds.
---
it does almost nothing for your condis.
---
I just had an idea - I don't know if the RemindMe bot is still around, so how about people reply to this comment if they want to be reminded a couple days before the meeting? And then I'll go in and make sure everyone gets a lil notification a day or two (or three) before the meeting?
---
As long as there's an option to turn off seeing other player's ones, then it sounds good. Nothing against them, it's just that I could see them potentially causing issues when you have like a zerg of people all loading to the same WP at once and they all start procing at once (like mass porting in WvW, boss trains, map meta events, etc). 
---
Some ideas for ones; 
---
* Clawing out of the ground like a zombie.
---
* Just falling out of the sky and faceplanting.
---
* An [Unstable Rift](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/794933296094388225) opens and your character jumps out of it. 
---
* A [Charr copter](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Deluxe_Charr_Copter.jpg) flies down, lets your character out, and flies off.
---
* Skritt (or some other type of race/creature) carry your character in on a [throne/palanquin](https://i2.wp.com/bunnyears.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/palaquin.jpg?fit=640%2C405&amp;ssl=1).
---
Reviving animations, teleport animations, death animations (like queen bee or chak egg sac), drinking animations w/ various drinks, more emotes in general. I would buy then in a heartbeat anet.
---
Inbetween? They already confirmed there's no expack inbetween S4 and S5.
---
its super tanky but theres no need for it in PvE and in WvW its about equal to guard but people dont know to to play with it as much as they do with guard. it actually has a ton of % damage reduction with dwarf and either ventari or herald. its actually really strong with mallyx for the AoE resistance too. but its tricky imo. maybe im too used to guard though.
---
Thanks for the suggestion!
---
If you want a little reminder a day or two before the meeting, I made a [little comment you can reply to](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bnfnur/tyria_pride_2019_call_for_volunteers/en8absd/). I'll go through it a couple days before the meeting and make sure everyone gets a notification.
---
Unfortunately, dev confirmed that they can’t do that due to limitations.
---
That's one of the best things about GW2 - you can always just jump into it whenever something cool's going on :P
---
Mesmer, because it’s mesmer. Always will be
---
Awh. There's great and supportive people to be found in every community &lt;3 I'm sure there's a ton of A Hat in Time players who were very excited to see themselves or their close ones represented that way!
---
Nah, not really.
---
Trials like Thordan EX, synced though? Yeah those are harder.
---
Unrelated to Gw2 expect the Asura part, but that means Mister Smit.... Ehh I mean the fourth wall police wont be coming back?! :O
---
It is definitely Sunrise. Eternity has a glowing jewel on the pommel and Twilight has bat wings. Also you can see Sunrise's gold sky behind the right arm.
---
What an awesome work again!!
---
No they're really just repackaged quests, they're functionally the same.
---
With you there, generic spooky skeletons is all they're supposed to be.
---
it sounds like you think you can only level by doing hearts or quests as you first called them. GW2 the only thing you need to level is exp, and exp comes from a wide variety of source. Hearts give a tiny amount, events a so-so amount, exploring new areas and getting map completion (collecting POI's, vistas etc etc) give a nice amount, killing mobs yields the best xp. All of these things scale to your level so you always get decent exp regardless of the lvl of the map/mob and your current lvl. Mobs have a base xp value and then the longer they have been alive they get a bonux exp value, add in the %exp modifiers you can get from the guildhalls, food, exp boosters etc and you can end up getting more exp from a single kill than spending 5min on a single event.
---
Go fourth, explore, experiment, and most importantly stop thinking Gw2 follows the same rules the rest of the mmo world does. Well most importantly have fun it is a game after all.
---
Mr. Smith is dead, his funeral will be attended by his billions of clones.
---
Congratulations!!
---
they have? well shit.
---
Yeah sorry to burst that bubble :S Season 5 will start 2-3 months after tuesday
---
Nope
---
Mesmer sees little meta play in wvw, ranger sees absolutely none unless you're playing casually or in a low tier.
---
Used to do this farm all the time, except I did Maguuma Lilies too.
---
They could add skins for many things like that and it would sell, probably without backlash. Look at all the Gathering Tool skins for an example. They could add: Waypoint animations, more emotes in general
---
Yeah there's a definite lack of enrage timer tuning and DPS checks in GW2. Raids could be more engagin if they actually forced you to DPS well in addition to just doing mechanics.
---
Quests usually tell a story, hearts only do this in a very indirect way. The fact that hearts were a last minute addition, because test players felt a lack of guidance should say a lot. 
---
Events on the other hand do check most of the boxes of what quests usually do.
---
Thief and ele can be insane in roaming or small groups.  Thief can run the super cheese one shot deadeye build, and condi tank weaver is kinda cheesey, but still strong.  Ranger can also be a very strong roamer. Mesmer I will agree to a certain extent, but mirage in a PvP environment is inherently strong due to the confusion factor. Warrior is very very common in my experience both roaming and zerging.
---
Don't know if your interested in considering raids.  But there is an easy to obtain set of ascended armor with any stats you want which would be a lot cheaper, obtained from doing the first collection for legendary armor via raids (Envoy armor1: experimental Armor).  Its how I got my first set of minstrels way back.  The first collection is essentially just kill each raid boss and some open world stuff.  No cost, no materials, free entire armor set (its not even the actual precursor so you can do with it as you please).
---
Should've known Mouse Child's power would never be contained
---
Well, I don't think either of us know the gw2 musicians, so all we can do is keep it at speculation.
---
Most PvE would be ok, but PvP would be rough.
---
Mounts in GW2 are different from WoW and are more about function than looks.  Skins are available from the gem store.
---
You can buy gems with gold.  100gems for ~35gold, which takes about 2 hours to farm.  Convert when gems are cheap, then spend when sales hit and you can get a nice outfit with 6 hours of play.
---
Healers are rarely, if ever, in demand in open world content.
---
&gt;just kill each raid boss
---
Since I main thief and am not part of a raiding guild, this feat is out of reach for me.
---
A lot of the servers from anet are running on Amazon EC2. Anet most likely didn't configure them to respond to "ICMP Echo Requests" (e.g. ping command). This way to will never get a response from the servers even if you are able to normally connect to them.
---
Hence why I'm not willing to waste my time searching explanations and rationalization. 2s kick, and I've forgotten him already.
---
Yeah for WvW purposes. I ended up doing a transfer to the linked server, which was a lot cheaper gem wise. Thank you everybody for your input!
---
I was reading this while YT was playing the opening of "This is America", of Childish Gambino. Damn timing... xD
---
I’ve played PVE with 250 - 350 ms ping. It’s not that bad; you’ll just have to adjust your timings to accommodate the difference.
---
Does this even have anything to do with GW2 anymore
---
Doing fractals, pvp or wvw is a far better way to get a minstrels set due to its insane cost. If you must have minstrels ASAP, I’d recommend getting an exotic set from reward tracks until you can get ascended from one of the sources I mentioned above.
---
and if you wanted a second set, you can keep doing the collection and make the crystalline heart for 100 amalgamated gemstones
---
thank you!
---
Understood.
---
so from what i gather, the conversion rate is something like that of a stocks market. And the Black Lion Trading Company store sometimes have sales for their skins? 
---
the time-measure is very helpful thankyou!
---
You'd never see it since you need to wait out the loading screen while your character model loads in.
---
Awful idea.
---
I don't want to wait around for an animation when I waypoint.
---
The current system works perfectly. It's instant, as it should be.
---
alright! sounds doable. thank you
---
New legendary dagger incoming!
---
Heal scourge is OP in raids as second healer ( first should be druid). In fractals u rather go with druid or heal firebrand.
---
What helmet is that? i've never seen a full cap on the goggles.
---
the appeal of an elite spec is the flavor of the theme, but also the new array of skills to choose from. If I'm having to choose between getting a new heal and a new elite skill, that's a huge buzzkill for me.
---
Then it was still a useful post. Personally, I really like the way GW2 fights are designed as I don't much care for rote memorization. I think it's naturally a much better fit for repeatable weekly content since you aren't just doing the exact same thing over and over, but you're free to hold a different opinion so long as that opinion is well-informed.
---
Despite a massive case of alt-itus my heal scourge is probably the closest I have to a main and I do occasionally find myself using him for open-world content, larger meta events in particular. You obviously won't have the damage of a full reaper build so when doing basic solo stuff it'll take a good bit longer to kill enemies. The damage is far from negligible, however, and on the other hand your survivability is insane. I've been easily able to solo champions with this build and can solo-hold one of the defense points in the Verdant Brink night meta. For big meta events and open world bosses, you bring all the same advantages that a support spec brings to dungeons or raids; big heals and rezzes (especially teleporting downed people with f4), a good amount of break bar damage, plus cool utilities like epidemic or spectral grasp. 
---
I've also had some decent success with just keeping the same gear but switching my talents over to an open world reaper damage build when I knew I was going to be doing solo stuff with this character. You still won't delete enemies quite as fast as a full damage option but basic enemies still go down quick enough, plus you still have extra survivability. I also highly recommend heal scourge in general for fractals and raids; despite lots of alts I generally prefer healers and it's my favorite to play: you utility slots are very adaptable and can be changed to matched the current encounter (particularly good for matching fractal instabilities), the heal and barrier output is ridiculous, and the ability to teleport and quickly rez downed allies helps you hard carry bad PUGs who miss mechanics and get themselves killed away from the group (looking at you Sloth and Matthias).
---
Hope this helped, and feel free to ask me anything about the build!
---
If the node names are anywhere near their actual locations it looks more like somewhere in Madrid. The 55% packet loss at the 8th hop propagates downward.
---
All mounts are account bound. New characters you create will have access to mounts you already have at Lv1. And yes, mount skins can be used by any of your characters within the same account.
---
seeing this i think aurene might be able to revive herself through the power of joko...
---
If dying saves others, it is not a bad thing.
---
If life is wasted by avoiding risk and new situations, it is a bad thing
---
Also pay attention if you get red bombs (high damage to the group), CC 2nd mini boss and kill turrets on 3rd miniboss.

Sorry for the downvotes dude, here have a meager upvote as I considered it to be on topic and valid/respectful.
---
Bound to player who revives of course.
---
* Imagine a necro reviving someone with a raising corpse revive animation! The rezzee's body would float with arms underneath the body and some green aura effect
---
* A Guardian with an angelic pose and wings reviving someone
---
* A vine/plants/flowers themed revive animation with Druids and whatnot
---
Thanks for all the feedback everyone. Knowing that I'm not locked into a specific build takes a lot of stress off my mind.
---
I main power herald in solo/small group wvw and pve. High damage, high mobility, high reward, but high risk. Those who claim you claim you camp hammer are useless outside of a zerg. Same for those who claim your rotation is just autoattacking. Though to be fair in raids autoattack is king. But I dont raid much
---
I find thematically the playstyle is very much like a thief. At this point no other class feels right if that makes sense. I always find another class lacking in some way in comparison. The exception is condi clear which I have almost none of.
---
However, I leveled my rev the hard way and it was extremely unpleasant. I had to force myself to play her and now I adore her
---
Gold matters to different degrees in other games though.
---
In GW2 anything that isn't gold related tends to drop from raids :p 
---
I get what they are saying, even if I don't personally value it as much as they do. In GW2 gold is versatile and allows you to progress whatever reward path you desire for the most part.
---
I think season 5 will prepare us for Bubbles and the expansion after it will come with complete UW rework with whirlpools (as updrafts) and new mounts.
---
I've played heal ren for a month and don't like it. Heal fb can provide Everything for any situation without trade offs, unlike renegade

No, only Rangers have pets that can fight. But anyone can have [Miniatures](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Miniature) (Mini Pets) that are just cosmetic and follow you around.
---
I'd certainly love to be proven wrong. But every single game I've ever played with aquatic zones, those zones have been my most hated.
---
&gt; and saw this cosplay
---
...today on the frontpage? https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bnkicp/activating_instant_kill_spiderman_ingame_cosplay/
---
What are the leggings and boots skins?
---
Well druid has easy 10 man might and spirits. Also if u want to play around the stuff druid usualls does in raids,  go for it.
---
Your print key broke?
---
Ending of this season cuts to black when we reach the new planet, 'Guild Wars 2' is displayed and we're all awe-struck that everything we have done so far was just the tutorial.
---
No, they check off what events do. Hearts are functionally quests. Events are their own thing, they're basically the same as fates from FFXIV for example.
---
I want to come back to the game, haven't played since release. I'd want to buy both expansions and there's a pretty good deal on the store: 25€ for both of them (standard). Can I upgrade them to deluxe later on? Thanks in advance.
---
Yep, I seem to get worse performance too, even with 6 cores, if it does indeed use two cores.
---
The lower performance, may be also, because I use windowed fullscreen, as it crashes alot in fullscreen mode.
---
Strictly speaking the bonus is now a glyph you can move to other tools (or purchase separately from the TP)
---
Not really.
---
I mean, if it happens to be up near me when I'm around, I'll go whack it, but I wouldn't return every day to a map I hate just to do the TM for a ridiculously tiny chance of getting something valuable.
---
Edit: missed a word
---
A core Necro Condi build can be strong even in newbie hands. Very tanky, good damage, easy to play. You won't be able to solo a whole team by any means, and the more skilled your opponents, the worse you'll perform, but overall it was pretty easy for me to jump into PvP with this and have decent performance. 
---
Though I would say if you have a main you really love, you might as well try it in PvP. You'll probably suck. Everyone did when they first started playing it. Learn your role in an sPvP match, learn your tools, and practice in unranked. If you lose - so what? You still get track progress, and it's just unranked fights anyway. You'll want to learn it eventually, so why not start early?
---
No, no, no. For a shaman spec we shall need a new weapon type - a tambourine.
---
What varies is the amount of purposes gold have in those games. The only "useful" way to spend Gil in FFXIV is to purchase glamours off of the market board.
---
 And suprising amounts of support questions. 
---
And cosplays.
---
If you don't wana raid, don't raid.  But thief is amazing in raids, so I have no idea why thats a problem.
---
I don't. My experience at trying to get into raids is getting kicked upon joining a squad, because Thief doesn't do as much on-paper-DPS as an elementalist.
---
so many fewer particles to render; it'd be huge during world boss trains or major map meta events.
---
Actually SC considers theif the meta healer for matthias due to the stolen plasma skill.  The only boss thief is amazing at would bc cairn, and even for that you have condi thief as an option if you really wana min/max.  Alternatively just play a normal thief there in a pug group that doesn't care.
---
I have a brilliant idea. What if.. hold on. What if.. Aurene comes back with Jokos power?
---
Yeah try healing and giving stab or reflect in chaos fractal as heal ren. Heal fb cheeses any fractal or instabilits, which is good for pug groups. Also dps ren can take boonstrip so warrior does not have to go spb which evens the loss of having the fb being zerk.
---
Right. For pug groups and survivability I still recommend fb though.
---
Lets not forget Mini Raccoon!
---
Metabattle is actually still up to date to show how builds rank these days.
---
Firebrand replaced Tempest as the support of choice. Core Guard is popular but got nerfed recently.    
---
Necro's role didn't change much, strong damage, AoE, and node denial, but easily targetted and require to be protected. Reaper got pushed away from condi into an all out juggernaut type spec.    
---
Engineer got a lot better than in your days, Holosmith being in the same kind of role as Revenant, Scrapper being a strong side noder.   
---
Dagger Pistol Thief just got hit haaard, people are playing old Acro Sword dagger. Deadeye is a fringe gimmicky burst build, but you see some quite often.  
---
Portal for mesmer got nerfed hard, so you don't see it anymore, but Mesmer is just very strong at everything since the rework to phantasms.  
---
Druid is not that strong anymore, and Soulbeast is more of a versatile dps ala warrior, its strong.
---
Ele is overall the weakest class. Tempest is average, core fresh air is dead. Weaver has either a sword bunker variation or a fresh air all in burst build, but both are sub-optimal.
---
&gt;Death in FF14 means res whenever possible but no direct penalty for not immediately doing it.
---
This is true to an extent, first is very important what role is dead, especially if a tank is dead. Secondly is what mechanic will happen in the future, if is something like grand cross(o4s), forsaken(o8s), hello world(o12s), debuff heavy mechanics, if you don't have all 8 players alive when the boss casts it then the party will probably wipe.
---
Talking with blank messages, very productive
---
I came back to the game today after a lengthy break (ive just been signing in to get the LWS4 chapters unlocked for free, been busy yo). I did octovine today for loot and everything dropped as unidentified gear, akin to PoF stuff. i sent the champion bags to my bag opener as per standard protocol, and that all dropped unidentified gear, too, and all of those "identified" as level 80 items. does this happen for ALL champion loot bags now? if so, how are people supposed to make ascended materials without making a million alts every week or farming centaur for eternity?
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...
---
Buut due to our new rules the questions must be left in the [&gt;weekly QA post&lt;](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/search?q=title%3Aquestions+thread+author%3AAutoModerator&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new&amp;t=week).

contact support. we can't help.
---
Your account is only in danger if the key you bought was purchased from a stolen credit card. If it is a legit key, then you'll be fine. You'll just have to live in that fear though unless you can contact support and get their advice/help on the matter.
---
Its tough for people, like me, who can only play on weekends, to resist the entire week not visiting the sub :) I never got anything spoiled, mainly due to the mod team removing things quickly.
---
you could ask support if they can replace your extensions if you buy them from them maybe
---
Yes, they're terrible.
---
That's why you must not stop.
---
Doing dailies every day will give you 10 AP until you hit the cap of 15k points. There's a lot of achievements in replaying the stories as well. Raids, WvW, and PvP have a lot too. Most of the time I just search through my achievement list to see stuff I can still do.
---
I think i Will Just craft ascended weapons for characters I like to play and continue playing casually... I was thinking about crafting legendary bow through legendary collection kudzu but amount of resources needed is just crazy.
---
Flipping legendaries? This got me curious. My business was always crafting legendaries and selling them for profit, and I've seen a steady decline in their prices. Maybe a bit of rebound after Istan nerfs, but still way below what they used to sell. Isn't it hard to flip for profit in a market like this?
---
Understandable as well. Most people run dark reapers so ya it wouldnt fit at all. But seeing as i run a more white base theme on my reaper adjusting to a bright ghostly blue wont be a problem and im gonna rock the new gs :D
---
nothing like 2 lvl 20 joining AETHER EXPERTS RUN....
---
Do them enough times and they become predictable too. At least, they are when your group is skilled and experienced.
---
And yes, animation cancelling is fucking dumb when the skill still casts (useful in PvP for faking actions and wasting a defensive) but ANet tend to remove more and more of them with each patch.
---
And "I never ever played this game didn't even watch the trailer or a gameplay video, bought both expansions, boosted my char to 80 right after tutorial omg am lost help this game is bad"
---
Trolls are in every competitive online game ever so....
---
Nah, as with flipping anything there is always a **risk**. But spend some time and look at what sells/buys for what. Compare if the risk vs movement of stock is worth it or not etc.
---
It's kinda like buying stocks, only way safer if you ask me. Going in blind is a certain way to lose cash though.
---
Youre btter off with dmg in open world (seeing as you still havent corrected the post) 
---
Fractals no take druid
---
Raids dont ever ever use metabattle for builds. Take ideas from it. Only good as a secondary healer (when you have a druid in group) and when you do have take it its amazing and i love it. Use snowcrows setup and guide but use magi gear for the op barrier unless its a high skilled group then use their gear setup
---
Also with the [Gallant Greatsword Skin](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gallant_Greatsword_Skin)
---
Go watch  [https://www.twitch.tv/roms\_hut](https://www.twitch.tv/roms_hut)  or  [https://www.twitch.tv/mightyteapot](https://www.twitch.tv/mightyteapot)  (he plays pvp occasionally).
---
I've got over 1200 boss kills and have never cancelled an animation in any rotation I've ever done, except maybe once on staff elementalist over two years ago... But that meta is long gone. As for "the dance," 65% of gw2 raiding is being at the right place, to do the right thing, and the right time. The other third is dps/tanking/healing.
---
I, on the other hand, tried FF raids and found it horrible how 'locked in place' you felt. Arenas are small and cast times are long. On the other hand, fighting Qadim or Dhuum feels like you've got an entire map to yourself and the raid boss.
---
There's a huge freedom of movement in gw2. But it's still very much a "be here at this time and do your rotation" experience.
---
From my experience:
---
Every 3 match in silver
---
Every 10th match in gold
---
And every 5th in plat
---
Edit: yes i climb silver to plat almost every season, because i allways do placements at the worst times :D
---
I kinda loved the collection and the back is really awesome with all those animations
---

at this point its just embarasing for ANET,base is solid,but that random shit on every outfit or armor is like 5 years old makes final touches.

Needs some silver in the suit or light gold cuz endgame
---
i used to send champion loot bags to a bag opener alt to generate lower-level loot to get my T3/4 materials, so it kind of has for me. I dont know how everyone else is doing it aside from botting for centaurs
---
Love PvP, loathe dubstep, but upvoting because it’s actually fairly accurate.
---
I phinally crafted my first legendary after 7 years!!!! I am beyond excited and wanted to dedicate it to my in game hero KIGGLES who reached out to donate towards my goal without any prompt whatsoever! I wouldn't even have this beautiphul longbow if it wasn't phor him! Beyond gracious for this game's community and beyong impressed that I had the patience to craft it... my snow owl Snubnose is also frickin shocked!
---
For fractals, 
---
[Hybrid](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/hybrid-chronomancer) and [Power](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer) Chronomancer are strong picks
---
For Raids
---
[Support](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/support/) Chrono is pretty much always wanted, [Condi](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/mirage/condition/) Mirage is meta for very particular bosses because of its high condition damage, and [Power](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/) Chrono is good pretty much in all instances, but it can be swapped out for other power DPS roles
---
I didn't play nearly enough GW1.
---
Let's be honest, Snubnose is the real highlight here.
---
Okay Kyle, calm down BRO

For companys these ringtones are useful, for others... don't.
---
It was just a possibility what anet could apply.
---
There are certanly enough people out there who would give money for either of those.

i was just about to say that too. but i can hardly see it need a better view. But if i had to guess i would say corrupted shard
---
Congrats!

It's missing the "Did map completion and crafted my first legendary after x amount of years" posts.

Fortunately, Chalice of Tears is infamous enough that a lot of people port it.

imo, [Searing Ascent](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Searing_Ascent) is a *lot* worse.

Thanks to you both! it definitely looks like it

r/guildwars2 the past few years*
---
Hmmm.. Where are the tar regions other than in Fireheart Rise? As for the colouring, I think it was done to differentiate the region from Kryta. I use reshade to adjust the yellows and oranges to make it much greener like pre-searing.
---
This is exactly what I was wondering.
---
You know, being a crystal dragon that ate Joko its entirely possible thdt she'd come back by awakening herself. We've only seen her manifest her powers of the brand but not the other powers she's eaten so far and I wouldn't be surprised if they decided that in 1996, Mordremoth attacked the Mother Tree in the Grove, meaning he could attack us anywhere.

Thank you!!

This scene would make for a kickass DM screen.
---
Those bags only gave lvl80 loot before too, you just didn't notice because it looked like everything else. Bags that scaled with lvl before still do.
---
Really? I spent some time there when I began HoT, but other than the quests that was it. What's so good about it?
---
nice, i phinnaly crafted it too 10min after the patch had brought it to the game, damn felt good
---
I guess I'm out of touch since I'm so frugal, but given that the stuff you can buy is mostly cosmetic, are people really buying that many blue crystals? I mean, sure, many people buy them, but there's a certain limit to how much the average person is willing to spend on cosmetics, and it's not like we're talking about a game like Fortnite that's played by many millions. And an MMO has to pay a lot of server costs and salaries to devs, overhead etc...
---
Well, I guess the point is moot, the game is profitable and that's all there is to it, no point in me trying to understand it.

Good pick. Was my first weapon i worked for when I hit 80.
---
Thanks! Definitely doesn't get the appreciation it deserves! Stunning details in this weapon for sure
---
Would not work since there can be multiple ressurectors. Unless the first sets the animation.
---
I still have the box too! :D
---
I adore the white stardust-like projectiles along with their soft thrumming sound.
---
there's a couple of account upgrades and gems can be traded for gold
---
That's not how flipping works really though, you buy a lot of different items. Not 100 of X item. Unless its something that moves super fast.
---
Typing in the name of the individual dyes, clicking them, changing the price, clicking list buy order then times that by the amount of different dyes you want = a lot of clicks.
---
GW is not about "oh there is a quest, I have to do it" it's more about "okay what's over there? A cave? Cool, what's inside? It's there something hidden for me?" you have to get the mindset of an explorer rather than a worker! Don't think in tasks you HAVE to do to get to a certain point, just travel where you want and see what's going on. 
---
Oh someone suddenly needs help?
---
 What's the matter? 
---
Do I want to do it? 
---
Yes? - great! 
---
No? - nvm I'll get exp + Loot elsewhere
---
Many struggle to get this mindset where you simply do what you like and progress in your own pace. The only quest like content are the storylines, the rest is choice based. You can level by crafting, pvp, WvW, doing dungeons, farming metals /wood /plants, just running around and discovering new vistas/POIs/way points..
---
The second hardest step to get yourself ready fit gw2, is to accept that there is no gear treadmill! Most "classic" mmo players are so used to it - the urge to get better gear to qualify for harder content - that they can't get along with it
---
"what? Wait, you mean that's it? No higher stats? The game is over now?"
---
No its not over, it just begun! If you reach Max level equipment (exotic or even Ascended /legendary) you are on the same level as the rest of us - stats wise. But there is whole lot of improvement you can get from this point. The difference to e.g. WoW is that you have to improve you personal skills, you can't rely on better equipment because there is none. If you want to kill something you haven't killed yet (meta event, Raid boss, fractal boss,..) you have to learn the attacks, you have to learn more about your class, you simply have to get better day by day.
---
Edit: tipos
---
Hey. Hey. Fun fact to know and yell: Sometimes you can just choose NOT to post.
---
I buy things on the cash shop every once and a while. 
---
Fashion wars is one of the main things people do for endgame in this game. Trying to get every single skin and dye can get quite grindy so people may choose to go to the cash shop for that. 
---
Also, there are people like me who spend money just to help support the game. Yeah, I don’t “need” to, but I have the philosophy that I should support the truly good games. Saying that you seem to be a little short on money to give to the devs by your original post, remember that it’s not the only way to help. Gather some knowledge, help out new players, or writing articles about the game are great ways to help as well. Having a character you don’t play as often stocked with consumables and dyes that you already have (you get unidentified dyes a lot) around racial starting zones and using map chat to ask if anyone needs assistance or just mailing some people some stuff with a nice letter attached is a great way to help. For new players, ten silver is A LOT of money the first few levels. This game wouldn’t be nearly as amazing without its community, so making people feel welcomed so that they’ll want to play (and want to help out the devs as well) is a great way to do things.  
---
Or you can be like me who uses their phone to constantly check the forums and answer any questions there. 
---
Happy Dragon-Slaying!
---
I was looking at mine while I was doing my room earlier this week. Its such a nice box :3
---
Looking like a jackass... to own the libs
---
The LSS2 ones do require story and achievement progress though and since they added in the mastery insights it's very easy to get enough mastery points without them. There are 66 mastery points without season 2 (82 counting it). 49 points are needed to fully max out every track. There are 5 hard rare collections, 1 hard fashion collection, and 3 harder to get fractal masteries. This leaves 57 options for only needing 49 without any season 2. Will also say that newer players shouldn't be in a rush to get the 19 points for legendary crafting as that should be the last one you fully unlock. Players should be getting a "free" 11 points from the "Hero" achievements, 9 from insights, and then be able to work on the 15 in fractals (+2 from nightmare and shattered), and can also get 7 from just silverwastes. Just the 4 areas listed there almost fully cap out.
---
Every skill animation includes the skins equipped by the player though; every leap; blast &amp; spin involves those. The Legendary Greatswords have a large trail on spinning skills like Binding Blade (guardian) or Whirlwind Attack (Warrior) 
---
any legendary that adjusts the skill animation (Nevermore's Raven Projectile)
---
The more people buy gems with gold, the more gold you can get getting gold for gems, so people with less time to grind and more cash to burn will be more tempted to spend a bit of cash for gems and get gold to buy things like legendary weapons.
---
Yup, any gear that would have been level 80 is replaced, bag openers still work the same as before.
---
That invulnerability won't work against fall damage, tho.
---
Be careful when using a vista while riding a mount.
---
I love the idea of the class, but cannot stand having the “legends” talking to me when I’m not in combat. 
---
Does that get better or do you eventually learn to ignore it?
---
Start a legendary
---
Fireheart is definitely a big one. Otherwise, we also see refinery equipment at [Irondock Shipyard](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Irondock_Shipyard) (Plains of Ashford) that can get clogged by tar elementals, as well as an entire water treatment installment at [Ebonshore Plant](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ebonshore_Plant) (Diessa Plateau), where tar elementals are also a threat.
---
Not to forget one of the first locations a new charr will encounter, [Lake Feritas](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lake_Feritas) (Plains of Ashford), also has tar puddles and elementals to clean up after.
---
It's rarely as bad as having standing puddles of tar on the surface of the water, but the effects of the Searing are still a notable part of everyday life in Ascalon.
---
Edit: Also, I'd love to see some screenshots of that reshade you described! I've yet to find one I like, but it'd be cool to see your version of Ascalon.
---
Warrior
---
Mine is in my room back home, so whenever I come home it’s there waiting.
---
And if you want infinite stores of random ascended junk lying around to insta-gear anything you want whenever you want while bypassing all stat-specific costs and time gating, join a raid static!
---
I know how flipping works...
---
Stop talking to me. go away
---
Yup I do the same haha
---
all of these questions can be answered with necromancer
---
And Instabilities are Anets way to buff Necros in Fractals, since most can be used as an advantage.
---
Good job :-)
---
dont play chrono
---
dont exhaust yourself on farming for legendary weapons
---
dont zerk farm in silverwaste or istan
---
look up the proper builds for the contend you play: [Open World](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World/Soloing), [Raids](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/), [Fractal](https://discretize.eu/builds)
---
if you dont have expectations yet warrior is probably the best core class
---
I wouldn't get one; I have one and barely ever use it. unless you're _serious_ about wanting to run organized events; a mentor tag is enough to get people to your location for help with an event.
---
Honestly? Don't play it like you'd probably play WoW.
---
Gw2 is more of a journey, and less of a "you got to max level, now GEAR YO ASS". As others have said, take your time, try everything out, don't really rush it. And most importantly, enjoy what you do. Levelling and gearing can be a slog only if you make them, so like... Look at the sky or listen to the NPCs, there's a lot more hidden gems than you'd think. :)
---
Source: ditched wow 2 years ago, came here, never looked back :P
---
I don't like how the violence was censored.
---
It’s just so clean, if it was released now it would be praised for the design
---
Fair enough. I figured OP should know about it in case that sort of thing interests him/her
---
Exactly. And that's only the magic that got released, since Kormir absorbed almost all of it. If she hadn't, it would have been much, much worse for Tyria, and Kralk's magic is much more than Abbadon's I reckon.
---
I guess some just never buy with RL money (except expansions and stuff), but I find that most people from time to time just think "What a nice game, I should pay at least a little for it.", so they do. Because that gives them a reason to buy that stuff, even if it is cosmetic, and most of all: they can feel good about it.
---
Hm yea, I saw those, but I don't know what I'm always doing anyway in the game.
---
No, its a challenge.
---
With the new mount coming next week you might not need the griffon mount.
---
We are praising Anet for their current advertising campaign, maybe bringing back those collectibles would be a nice way to make the game even more popular
---
And (as someone who doesnt use it) Way too much spam about new ‘taco’ features no one asked about but will still (probably) be used by plenty people
---
Wakwa it is! and has been for a around 3 years now
---
Speaking purely from WvW experience right now the top tier roaming classes are:  
---
Holosmith- great burst damage, great CC potential, good disengagement abilities. Tricky to use but once mastered its arguably the best for roaming over all.  
---
Soul beast- great damage and really high burst potential. Good access to stealth. Boonbeast build in particular is nearly unkillable in a 1v1 situation.  
---
Hm.. condi mirage isnt really as good as it used to be, but if you're into DoTs its still the best for dueling. Power Mirage is good and can one shot unaware players but can struggle more in longer fights.

Berserker may not be top tier but its def the flavor of the month right now. Can pump out crazy high crits with overall good sustain for longer fights.
---
Edit: oh and forgot power herald. Has the burst and mobility of a thief with the defense of a warrior.very strong in duels, less so in 1vXs and tricky to use.
---
Or a prediction?
---
I have Keyrun and Free Key Run. Keyrun later on evolved into bag opener and home instance gatherer so he's 80 now, but Free Key Run dies and reincarnates every week :P
---
Yeah. I agree. Back then simply having on-demand stability and protection was huge.
---
WvW isn't really for solo classes. I main a Daredevil, and WvW was torture so i switched to Deadeye. Still was terrible until I made a Scourge Alt. Now it's easymode, and much faster to get rewards than Daredevil ever was.
---
I'm so glad I'm not on NA.
---
So, we hear in Caithe's Requiem story that the Commander has been doing nothing for days. In this most recent trailer, we see the Commander kneeling before Aurene's corpse before *standing up* as if to finally make a move. In the latest "behind the voice" video, we hear the commander say "this is for Aurene."
---
I think this all together is meant to convey the idea that Aurene's death doesn't have to be *the end,* but rather a reason for us to keep fighting. Even with the threat of the universe falling apart, we will end Kralkatorrik. *For Aurene,* because her death *inspired others*, and our lives will only be fulfilled by *taking this risk.*
---
Aurene lives on in our hearts, and we will make sure she lives on in our actions.
---
Does that help at all?
---
Exactly in the same boat as you :)
---
Key farm characters are the only time I make silly character names so I tend to go with "Key" puns as well. It's fun to spot other key farmers easily identified by their names as well.
---
Honestly this is the most likely, apart from OP simply misremembering (which I doubt was the case).
---
thanks ! I forgot to add that i'm ususally really agressive in my playstyle. I like big burst and chasing down ennemies. I like evading, in and out, counter and such.
---
What is dislike is straight up kiting and playing chest game with ennemies.

Is it tho? In HoT maps you gain level trough one meta event
---
&gt;Cosmetic cash shop that also allows you to buy the premium currency with in-game currency.
---
This is to take control away from people that sell gold for IRL money outside of the game. It's better for Anet to have control over it than lose money to gold-sellers.
---
FYI; park alts on JP with teleport to a friend, easy 3 orchids per day per alt.
---
Reaper really feels like one at the moment. Extremely powerful melee damage with tons of cleave.
---
&gt; On the uh, "portal access", it seems like part of the um, fallen god process, is getting your Mistwalker powers revoked. Balthazar couldn't port out until he jumpstarted himself with Sohothin, too. Never really thought about that in relation to the Shadow Nexus though -- why would the Gods need a shard of reality to control access? Maybe it was to bring in all of the Forgotten jailors?
---
Balthazar's power and divinity was stripped. Similar to Dhuum.
---
Abaddon, however, was still a full fledged god. His power was merely sealed behind the "locks" (aka "Gate of ..."s).
---
&gt; On the variety of cauldrons; I'm gonna need to replay Borlis Pass. Do you mean the Storm Beacons listed on the wiki?
---
Nope. Though the design is similar. I'm referring to the beacons at the *end* of the mission, which has a different design - there's three small beacons and one large one; the small ones match the design of those found in Lyssa's cave temple.
---
&gt;  And while the uh, spikey cauldron might have just been whatever old Bonfaaz had on hand at the time, it seems like that specific style is considered to be the canonical "this is going to ruin your day" cauldron design as of GW2, judging by the similar one(s?) near Khilbron's tower in the Straits of Devastation. Not saying it's a unique artifact, but the construction seems to be purposeful - and unless the Charr took the scenic route when invading Orr, it's very odd seeing that design in the Crystal Outlook.
---
Yes, as of GW2. As of Eye of the North even. But not necessarily as of Nightfall or Prophecies. It's possible the one in the Crystal Overlook was intended to be one from the get go. I've theorized as much. It's possible ArenaNet can retcon it into being one if they didn't. The important thing is that we don't know one way or the other.
---
In retcons, they could easily say that it was brought by the Olmakhan, who originated as Flame Legion. Not with the intention of using it, but because it was part of their faith they were slowly abandoning. Or to spite the Flame Legion.
---
It is! Sadly, i don't see that many anymore since i switched the character-creating day to Saturdays.

Mine's Random Key Generator. Had several others, but I forgot them ._ .
---
oh that explains people with mounts in the starting area. thank you!
---
Breaking news! Put you flux bomb-kind mechanic (what is it, the forth one in the game?) away! Wooooo. As if there weren't enough reasons to do so.
---
You'd better bet I am! It's just a great feel, since I play the game for fun, not profit.
---
(Well, at least after I finished all the content and masteries and world completion and crafted my favorite legendary already)
---
You can have miniatures, which are cosmetic pets.
---
If you meant combat pets, then you need to play Ranger, additionally there are some abilities and runes that will summon pets for a short duration while in combat, for instance the [Rune of the Ogres] (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Ogre).
---
Necro is best class. Anyone who disagrees is incorrect.
---
no
---
From the original art of book??
---
That is what sold me on this game too!! Kekai Kotaki’s work basically is Guild Wars 2 for me. It makes the load screens 100x better for me and reminds me that I should feel ashamed that I am playing and not painting. 😭
---
To answer the question in your title..
---
It uh, it doesn't.
---
Runescape animation please, I want to shrink into a tiny atom with a purple light.
---
what the....what the fuck?
---
I have 2 necro characters, One female char and one male human, also have 2 mesmers but thats only needed for for raiding! the rest of my characters only have character only
---
Good job man!
---
Chris Keys/Christina Keys. Gender is based on the last person I saw before the run.
---
The thing is, it only plays in LA I'm pretty sure. I haven't been there much ever since I got Mistlock sanctuary, as there's not much reason to go back there for gameplay reasons.
---
Mines a guardian called Keyla Pharm
---
WoW convert here, beta to LK. Here's the big differences:
---
WoW is about playing the gear and leveling treadmill. It's endless because the core content is RNG bullshit keeping you from the carrot, forever.
---
GW2 is about acquiring wealth and converting that wealth into something you want - cosmetics, new characters, legendary weapons, whatever.
---
GW2 will never increase the level cap, and a capable set of equipment for most solo content is 15 gold or less. There is no gear treadmill. New expansions bring new ways to play your character, not a new way to grind RNG for a couple years.
---
There is no trinity, except for raids and high-end fractals where there kind of is but not exactly? Everyone can heal themselves, everyone can buff the party somehow. There is no "tank" in WoW terms... you have to resort to active avoidance to keep big bois busy.
---
If you have a favored playstyle I can try to direct you to a class you might enjoy.
---
It's a not existing German word. Todesdarm.
---
In English it would be "Death intestine".
---
Don't ask
---
Quaggans have been out of the reddit meta for a while now. "is gaem ded" and "first world completion ever!!!1!2" is where it's at.
---
So when I got the game which was close to release I made an Elementalist and hated it, in hindsight because I was terrible at playing the class, and dropped the game because of this after like 80 hours of game time. About two years ago some of my friends took up the game again and we all decided to make new chars and level together. That's where I made my Guardian, and started to really fall in love with the game. Guardian and both it's elite specs are great to get into the game. It's relatively easy to get a hang of and play to be decently effective. At the same time it can get complex and more difficult to play if needed. I have played that char for more then 400 hours now and I'll probably never get bored of it.
---
$25 for both xpacs right now is an absolute steal though.
---
The aggressive monetization models are for games with a short life cycle.  They need to make all their money over 3-6 months, if not a couple weeks before people jump to the next free to play game.
---
A.Net and MMOs lend themselves to developing long term player bases.  Providing good value through the cash shop in the form of account upgrades reinforces long term buy in from players.  You could monetize GW2 like a phone game and make a quick buck, but once players got over the initial rush of playing the game that model would hasten them moving on.
---
Generous cash shop offerings are consistent with a long term player retention model and likely maximizes the long term value of their customer relationships.
---
Why not play a chrono? I'm leveling a mesmer at the moment with the intentions of playing a chrono.
---
Hi, whats the best pass to get i.e. Captain's Airship Pass, Royal Pass or Mistlock Sanctuary Passkey? Or are all areas the same?

---
Had to do it huh haha, nice stuff there!
---
Human shoulders just aren't enough here.  So sad.
---
My understanding is:
---
&gt;But death's not death that breathes life into others
---
This follows the notion that a person "lives on in memory". If you're remembered in death, it's not truly death.
---
&gt;And life's not life that never dares to risk
---
Similarly, it isn't a "life worth living" if you never take any risks in that life.
---
Is it announced or at all likely that Ele will be able to use a GS at some point in the future?
---
I hope we get to recreate this scene in the new living world episode.
---
That's disgustingly awesome
---
I got into the franchise after seeing a picture of Eve from the first game.
---
The GPU is good and the RAM is sufficient. You probably want to get an SSD rather than just a 1 TB hard drive. The CPU has a great single thread rating, so this computer should have no problem running Gw2 at near-max graphics with a good framerate.
---
Could you get better value for the same price? Yes, definitely.
---
In terms of how people play that is purely a function of rating.  Pretty much anything lower than plat will have lots of mistakes each game.
---
Honestly I definitely feel your pain where you can only have 2 people in ranked.  I would take a few lopsided matches with better community over what we have today.  
---
My advice is to play a class where you really enjoy the playstyle rather than one you want to win with as winning is going to be a lottery.
---
Not sure on how well it'll run GW2 (does anything *really* run it well?) but you can build it yourself for much cheaper - it is not worth 1000.
---
50s is barely any money, even at low levels, so I’d keep it and try using it, see if you like it. (If you need that gold, I can help you out if you’re on NA servers) Even if you were to ignore the fractal stuff, having instant access to bank, TP, and merchant whenever you want AND being able to go back to what you were originally doing is reaaally nice. Run out of pickaxes? Buy another immediately and go back to farming. Ordered a new weapon to use? Pick it up immediately and start using it. Material storage filled up? Sort it out in the bank and go back to doing whatever you were doing.
---
It’s one of those major quality-of-life things that you don’t find particularly gamechanging at first, but the more you use it, the more you can’t live without it.

Hello. I downloaded the most recent marker pack 1.9.6 - 12.5.2019 but I don't see the checkbox for PoF areas. Only your old mussel farm markers and I do not get the path connecting the mussels, only the individual nodes. Is the current pack link updated? Thank you :)
---
maybe one day i'll understand what anyone sees in this legendary
---
It's under Gathering Nodes, other mussels are just leftovers I've removed them for newer version but since they are on the exact same spots it should not do any harm now:-)
---
I've just double checked my all in one pack with fresh taco installation and it works for me.
---
&gt; GW2 is about acquiring wealth and converting that wealth into something you want - cosmetics, new characters, legendary weapons, whatever.
---
This part is the best way to describe it.    
---
Also I'd add that the best part about GW2 is that the goals here are crystal clear with almost zero RNG involved. Collections, mystic forge/regular crafting, if you want something - you get it step by step, always seeing the path ahead and how much there is left. It's very refreshing after WoW's rng bullshit fiesta. Bar some extremely expensive items like bee infusion or invisible slippers, tasks are pretty straightforward. Want a Nightmare Corsage skin for your focus? Kill the boss without being hit by explosion and you are guaranteed to get it. Want a Machinized Hammer? Buy Plated Hammer with salvaged plates, do a collection - bam, aggressively red engineered hammer is yours. Same with basically everything.
---
Lmao Gimmie Key
---
It sucks but theres no good heavy single shoulders
---
I've re-downloaded your marker pack 3 times and overriden the one I had before. Mussles still appear under HoT and I still don't see the PoF markers.
---
Ssds are extremely fast in comparison.
---
That is it, same function but personally I don't have a single harddrive in my pc, just ssds, windows staring in 17 seconds or so? Check. Loading screens in gw2 being so fast that I tend to stand and wait around for other people loading in group content? Check.
---
First class that comes to mind is [Hammer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Juggernaut)
---
Key McLuck (my bag opening char is Open McLuck)
---
Actualy with the nerf to spirits, Druid can easily be replace with even increase in performance. It now only bring 10 man Might, Spirit  and really low uptime in other boons. I found Healer Herald way more strong, consistant and carry way more than Druid.
---
SC didnt change whats BiS for ages and did it with only the idea of traditionnal composition when you could actualy get more consistant kill with other comps.
---
But yeah, Scrouge healer is trash tier.
---
Ignore those under hot and pof its all under Gathering Nodes 😊
---
Until I moved yup! Then it got thrown into a drawer XD. Just found it the other day when I was cleaning up my desk
---
First and last advice is dont buy pre-build pc's. At the same price you can build a much better pc.
---
This pc has no ssd in freaking 2019. That alone should pop some questions. Secondly, having a 4gb GPU in 2019 is also low. More than enough for GW2 (as it barely uses the gpu) but new games will just bottleneck the GPU heavily. U want at least 6gb GPU to be comfortable with newer games.
---
This pc can definately run GW2 at max settings on 1080p but it is very very low Future-Proof. The cpu is good for old games that use only one core but buying a cpu with no multithreading capability will perform same or worse with a ryzen on new games as they can take advantage of multithreading. For 1000$ its not worth it. Generally pre-build pcs are rip offs.
---
Also this pc doesnt mention a lot of important factors. Does it have the stock cooling? Cause stock cooling sucks BIG TIME and cpu will barely boost to 3.7-3.8 before it reaches bad temperatures and will have to throttle, especially on intel CPU'S which run hotter. Is the power supply good or will just fry after 1-2 years? 3000mhz ram is good but if its not high quality ram it will be unstable or might have crushes when running at maximum speed. Again no ssd, which is just disappointing.
---
Pre-build pcs try to take advantage of people not knowing about pc parts and performance so they overcharge hardware and sometimes put very shitty parts inside like ram or hdd or ssd or psu as the average consumer only cares about cpu and gpu. Basically if they dont say what brand a hardware part is, u can bet its gonna be some crappy second-hand part.
---
My suggestion, there are wonderful guides to choosing parts and building pc's on youtube. Some are for budget gaming, other for high end gaming, others for workstation-gaming, you can find everything. Building a pc is not rocket science, you just watch a youtube guide and follow the instructions. As for windows, u can just make a bootable usb drive (there are insrtuctions on youtube). Install windows and buy a licence key from ebay. I bought mine for 2$. Some people spend 100$ on windows which is such a big waste. Better keep that money and spent it on the GPU or CPU.....
---
How is a sword _literally_ an armor?
---
I'm at work atm but go to snowcrows.com and they have the build listed. I prefer the sw /sw and sw/focus build but the great sword variant has its own pros and cons.
---
I like the play style. It's much more about anticipating and reacting than just spamming skills. Pair that with the energy system forcing you to ration your OP stuff, and it just feels like a really unique profession I can take anywhere. I know a lot of people complain about the energy system, but I almost wonder if it would improve the feel of a few other professions if they also had to abide by it, too. Just a thought, don't crucify me over that.
---
I remember being totally enamored with the profession during the HoT previews, and it kind of stuck ever since.
---
&gt; Any tips on playing them?
---
Again, I'll point to the "anticipating and reacting" thing I mentioned earlier. Staff doesn't do a ton of damage but it can wildly improve your survivability in a big fight (I mainly do PvE, as a note). Hammer and shortbow are both good for backing off when you need to let your energy/cooldowns/health bounce back, while still maintaining some good pressure. But then the CQC weapons are great at hit-and-run tactics and in-their-face tactics.
---
All that to say, this is a good profession for being more adaptable and maybe not as closely tied to "meta" (edit: "meta style of play," I mean). It's still really solid when breaking away from rotations and switching gears.
---
I would highly recommend that you look into building a pc yourself. It really isn’t *that* hard if you’re scared of difficulty or not knowing a ton about technology. There are plenty of YouTube videos out there on how to build one, but picking parts will take some time to research on your own end. If you really don’t want to go down the rabbit hole of learning about what makes each different piece of a PC good/bad, then try a subreddit such as r/buildapc (I believe that’s a good one?). I’m sure you’ll find people more than willing to help you piece together a build for your specific needs. Best of luck!
---
Did you ever play through GW1?
---
I'm hoping for a devourer mount.
---
Yes, WvW takes place on an entirely different set of maps which you can access by pressing B (default keybind).
---
I actually think at the moment SoS may be full so you might not even be able to switch regardless, but it’s only really relevant to switch if you want to do WvW with other SEA players, and WvW only becomes decently worthwhile after reaching level 80 anyway, so you have plenty of time while you’re levelling to decide if you want to make the switch.
---
I think after the upcoming finale coming up, the writers may have more room to venture out to different territories in episodic fashion.
---
I usually create a look around the weapon so, perspective I suppose.
---
It's true for every group that runs a Chrono and a firebrand, my group isn't even close to being close to a guild that is somewhat decent, yet having a Chrono doing their normal rotation and me on renegade rune quickbrand is still more than enough, In bosses like sabetha it can actually benefit pugs a lot because youll do a lot more damage whilst still providing the same defensive and offensive buffs for your party. It's not even a case of your Chrono being slow, even with human error taken into account, renegade runes in a 10 man setting is plenty
---
Whew..it sure is a good thing you aren't the one that crafted it, right?
---
 I like the subtlety of it. The weapon draw effect is awesome to me and the animations are sweet. I don't need crazy effect trails to be happy.
---
i just run herald to pretend to be playing a gw1: nightfall dervish...
---
When that question was raised on the forums, Connor Fallon [clarified](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/698948/#Comment_698948) that Zafirah didn't kill any of the Pact members at Argon Garrison:
---
&gt; TBH, I never intended for those pact people to be dead dead so much as downed/passed out from the gas, but I disabled the ability to rez them because players would stop and try to revive them and fall to the poison themselves. She was going to try to stop anyone who tried to take the sword, she was desperate to accomplish her mission, but... yeah. More intense than I intended.  
---
Given her desperation and the fact she'd been fighting for Balthazar and more than willing to kill Elonians for her god's campaign, I did find her showing mercy to Pact intriguing although her actually killing the Pact members and then joining the Pact and Elonian alliance's side would've been a bit of a mood whiplash for players even though narratively it makes sense for everyone, including former enemies, to join forces to take on a bigger threat.
---
I've enjoyed Zafirah's role in the campaign as she helps humanize the misled Zaishen Order, their feelings towards the Commander, and shows us the human cost of how Balthazar's selfish crusade affected his worshipers. Her being around to explain some of the more faith-based and mystical stuff surrounding Balthazar and his sword has also been useful for the narrative, and the Requiem story appears to give some clues towards something players have been speculating about the existence of a new god of war ever since Balthazar's divinity was taken from him.
---
I only hope the Forged (who themselves were ultimately tragic heroes-turned-villains due to Balthazar's ambitions) aren't completely forgotten and that Zafirah plays some role in helping to act as an ambassador to let us negotiate with the remaining Forged to join the fight on our side as she did with the human Zaishen (still no word on the non-human Zaishen, sadly) and perhaps come to realization that someone else might now be carrying on Balthazar's work as a deity of conflict in the Six. :)
---
You pick one. Kiepha Ming, Blake Layonki, Quieve Arming...
---
So basically Destiny's Edge, you mean? :p
---
As far as I'm aware, there are pre-events. I had to do one of the refugee escort events and then wait about fifteen minutes before it would fire. Last time I checked the wiki it was kind of nebulous and getting the event to fire. I'd recommend getting some friends together, split up and do the escort events and have someone sit back in the temple and call you all back if the event you need fires up.
---
While leveling you will only ever open up more content/zones for you to play in, you don't outlevel anything. Keep an eye out for what NPCs say in the world, take note of it and follow them cause it  can lead to dynamic events and DE chains that all tell a story. That is how you level through PvE, Hearts are just supplemental and if you do an event near a Heart, the Heart progress will skyrocket and complete really quickly. Also, no matter your race you can move to any zone at any time within your level range and do whatever. There's no restrictions and you can get to another zone easily by going to the nearest city, find an Asuran portal to Lion's Arch(capital city) and then to another city from there. Everything you do gets you XP, events, hearts, exploration, rezzing other players, crafting, daily achievents, etc.
---
Yo moms house, ooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
...Yes,. You can go to Rata Sum in GW1 - the ingame year 1078AE. Primordus awakens in 1120AE.  
---
Prior to the founding of Rata Sum and the events of GW:EotN, the Asura were underground however. But Rata Sum was founded in Maguuma a long time ago.
---
You are absolutely right. Ty for answering my question. 
---
Just saying storm bow or chaos bow have similar effects lol.
