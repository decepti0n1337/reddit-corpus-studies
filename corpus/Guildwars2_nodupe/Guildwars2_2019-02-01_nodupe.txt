So for some reason mine is bringing up the first email saved from the previous one.

Let's say I set  "account1@gmail.com"  to the first account.  Then I try to do the 2nd account.  It'll still come up with the same email saved from the previous one.  What am I doing wrong?

Yes, and there are videos too, and one was even a pretty upvoted post on the sub too

Could just do the "this map is closing because of too few players" except it's not too few.

Herald is only really used effectively in PvP, renegade has good support and condi DPS builds.

Same for me.

Cutting edge achievement: should I craft mordant edge or buy cothol field burner off the TP? I have 0 weapon crafting.

1) White Stag is a creature of the Dream and would be very good at helping the Sylvari people. Friend who helps you catch it actually is Nightmare Court and wants to torture it to increase their influence on the Dream. You get the Stag.
---
2) You rescue a male Sylvari. Was poisoned and left for dead by the Nightmare Court. He wants to rescue his female love interest. She has turned to Nightmare and wants him to join. We find out that once you become Nightmare (even forcefully by torture) you never leave.

There are some darker dyes on different types of materials in the note section of [Shadow Abyss](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shadow_Abyss_Dye) wiki page. Try to preview those and see if they are any darker.
---
Weakness makes me sick. 
---
My new phone background (and that means something because I havent swapped in 3 years)!
---
I recently replayed through Season 2 and this really bugs me. In Episode 1 you aren't even sure there is a sixth dragon and in Episode 2 everyone suddenly knows Mordremoth. It is especially strange that it happened between episodes rather than between seasons.
---
1070 is a great card and would be a massive upgrade over the 1050 TI. I'd definitely recommend hitting up craigslist though and seeing what's out there - there's a decent chance you can find a 1070 TI / 1080 for a similar price as a new 1070 - especially with the mining crash. 
---
Please submit this as a shirt. It’s amazing 
---
Encountered this like 2 times too
---
on which spot was that?
---
that's not graphical option problem. It's from the texture of armor materials. If an example given, think of [Ice Encasement  outfit.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Ice_Encasement_Outfit)
---
Thanks bud!(:
---
&gt; and the time you said condi engi is strongest dps while nemesis showed you condi ranger is strongest dps before HoT.
---
Incorrect, condi engie was higher DPS than ranger pre-HoT. And Guang was the one who popularized condi ranger, and I picked it up right after he created the build.
---
I've been hearing rumours that former mining cards that are flooding the market now are usually on their deathbed. Any truth to that or just a fairy tale?
---
The crash is the reason why I started looking at 1070s too, wouldn't be able to afford one otherwise.
---
AFAIK that hasn't been confirmed anywhere. In February, probably, but Anet hasn't said there's a balance pass on Tuesday. 
---
&gt; This dye thing has nothing to do with "shiny". It's just the way the material works.
---
I said that... just not as eloquently as you...
---
The leveling curve itself is horizontal so there aren't any bottlenecks.  HoT &amp; PoF are just significantly more difficult than anything in the core game except maybe Southsun, Drytop or the Silverwastes.  Overall, it's a big shift in-terms of how aggressive enemies are and how dangerous they are.  Nothing can really prepare you for momentary lapses in concentration vs. certain enemies being deadly, taking significantly longer to kill enemies that have protection or realizing that you rushed and need a defensive trait line. 
---

They're all closer to about 35 gold a piece. Side note: [GW2 crafts](http://gw2crafts.net) is fantastic,
---
I'll take a poster please
---
Yes! I post a lot of my stuff on [twitter](https://twitter.com/henri_ev), and thank you!
---
This post was immediately followed by one of u/srgrafo 's RimWorld posts on my news feed. I was  well confused for a moment. :)
---
That's 0-400. Add it with 400-500 which is often times just as expensive.
---
then I'd accurately say as shiny off from all kinds of armor. We're talking about shiny from armors which we can't dye, thus shiny off might be closer to turn shiny off from armor, not to set post processing none.
---
Also Arenanet publishes gw2 without NCsoft now
---
Good; I was hoping for the strokes to be meaningful, with that overall level of quality, and OP didn't disappoint.
---
I absolutely need this
---
I believe they just teleport you far enough away that you're out of aggro range of w/e you were farming (a programmed bot would move back to the exact coordinates they were set to be at) while a real person would be like "wtf"
---
Woah, thanks for the link, your art is amazing! 
---
I got The Chosen randomly from a box in WvW about 5 months ago now; while I was wielding The Flameseeker Prophecies .__. (for which I crafted the precursor)
---
This is really interesting; I wonder if they're able to join ad-hoc any existing instance on the servers or have to join party and hide themselves from the UI. Either way, the possibility that they can watch us and manipulate stuff is scary :C
---
Any event is sufficient to trigger credit, from the lowliest defense event, JPs (but not on starter maps) through to big meta events. Every two events* (some slight diminishing returns after 18 or so events) you'll get a map bonus reward.

Is this just for pvp or all gamemodes?

"Buffed shatterstone damage by 12%, in exchange it now takes 1.25 seconds longer to detonate and we reduced its radius by 25%. We feel this changes will differentiate good elemetalists from great elementalists!"

That's why it'll release as a WvW mount during alliance update

When I see one in my home node and I'm not playing guardian, I just move on, they deserve that point just for existing, I just love when my teammates go there, in group of 2 , fight the mesmer for a few minutes and then the mesmer keeps running towards the back of the point, tugging them around.... when one of them leaves, the mesmers just burst the remaining one and there goes the point again....
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It is infuriating, frustrating, even if you manage to kill them because **THEY** messed up, you know that on next respawn they are coming back....
---
This is actually really good. Do you by chance do commissions? If so, please DM me! I'll be sure to look into more of your work soon. :)
---
Consider that the "balance" team nerfed Elementalists over Alacrity and have never done anything to mitigate it.  That's a boon the Elementalist still (a year or more after that nerf) has zero natural access to.  
---
If anybody wonders why some classes are broken in the most stupid ways possible and others somehow ended up with all the tricks at once, it's because those people are the ones calling the shots.

Next Halloween, I want to see a friendly centaur dressed up as an actual horse. When you talk to him, he should be concerned that no one seems to know what he's supposed to be, and begins asking you why people don't remember horses.

His Halloween will probably end up a bit more depressing than he originally intended.

How can I check if reshade (gw2 hook) is still active? Yesterday I wanted to try it out but I can't seem to pull up the window with the usual shift + f2. I have gw2 mount, arc dps and reshade together. It was working alright but just randomly can't pull up the reshade window to check. Please help.

My god. Take an upvote sir!

Backline hammer rev (Hearld) is a meta class on wvw. Fun to play, usually top tier dps.

I noticed this change after a patch that mentioned a fix to the way lighting affected the racing scarf/scarves. I assume this is meant to be 'fixed' but honestly I havent worn the scarves since, cuz they just look bad color-wise now.

Ice bow 5, more like longbow 4
---
Oh lord, don't remind me.  To be fair, Zeni's support isn't THAT bad... if you bought the game from them directly.  Anywhere else, especially steam?  Gooooood luck.
---
It's not dead, that's just a negative attitude.
---
99% of the "difficulty" in gw2 raids is offloaded onto supports. Mostly on chronos, although less so than it used to be.
---
I did this last weekend, so it may just be a map specific bug. See if you can get into a different instance of the map, and if not try again later, especially during peak hours or just after reset when there may be more instances available.
---
It would me more fun if it's destructible.
---
To be fair, there's not much room for an investigator on the front lines of a war. Or a noble's child. So both Kasmeer and Marjory couldn't maintain their original roles that made them so enjoyable while doing the plots of Heart of Thorns or the like.
---
Also, I think we're sick and bored of her *because* she's largely ignored by Anet, not the other way around. She wasn't too bad in Season 2 (though some folks complained due to the female human idle animations going on thanks to her and Kasmeer), but in Heart of Thorns she, Rox and, Kasmeer were largely just mutes. This being because they focused so much on Canach, Rytlock, Braham, and Taimi.
---
And that was a very bad move on ArenaNet's writers because Marjory had the biggest reason to be among the group at first (Belinda's death) and when we finally got to Mordremoth, as poorly written as that was by itself, she completely forgot about her desire for revenge and promises to personally kill Mordremoth. She should have been a fourth option to take into the Dream.
---
Because you have no crafting skills (I would highly recommend working on this just for future cases!) buying it would be faster, cheaper, and you'll have your ascended sword in no time.
---
But don't forgo crafting! You need it for making legendaries or saving some gold on getting these achievements. I am currently almost done with Kudzu, and saved about 200g on the precursor just because I had most of the crafting materials ready to be used alongside having 500 in Huntman. 
---
Hmmm that's not really the problem, the problem is that the game does a very poor job explaining the true mechanics, what weapons work with which stats, and you end up killing everything in the core game by spamming 1.
---
When you arrive to the expansion zones, the enemies have all special mechanics which suppose you know how the game works and they deal a lot of damage. I'd advice Metabattle Open World Builds so you give yourself an idea on how the class you play would look like at level 80 so you avoid using stuff that will just get you killed.

Funny though.

but have you seen drifting horse? ^^^^^because ^^^^^i ^^^^^want ^^^^^to ^^^^^see ^^^^^it ^^^^^too
---
I'll get the shredder.
---
Well, for me it is because I've made world completion and leveling like... 4 times. After getting to the expansion zones and fighting throught their respective stories and enemies, vanilla GW2 just feels boring, you plow through everything, enemy variety is way too few and their attacks mostly the same, you can't really "feel" a new class until you reach the endgame and in turn the expansion zones.
---
I would buy the hell out of a unicorn mount. I’m basically a three year old 🤷‍♀️
---
I usually don't look at the chat at all when I'm playing, so a whisper wouldn't do anything... but I guess just avoiding all the repetitive stuff that could be mistaken for botting works.

\[Help\] VERY new player looking for some guidance from an experienced Necromancer(want to make a minion build)
---
 Hey guys, this is my first time ever trying Guild Wars 2. I sank probably about an hour into it today with friends but I think I need a bit of guidance. (To be clear again, I am VERY sparkling new to this so please try and use layman's terms). We haven't leveled up too much yet, but looking into the future I'd like to not make any mistakes and know how to make a build focused on minion damage, but not be helpless with dealing out it's own damage. I'm looking to participate in PvP a little at some point, but for the most part I expect me and my friends to be doing Dungeons and other PvE stuff. I just feel kind of lost at the moment. Using scepter/dagger + staff rn. (By new I mean like lvl 9 or something lol). Thanks for taking the time to read! 
---
Interesting, I live in Canada and play from my laptop, my average pin in game is around 120 most of the times. I am connected through ethernet hoping that would help a little. I thought something like that might be happening as well, but didn't dig much into it. I'm planning on getting a new laptop in a few months, hopefully that would help too :D Thank you!!! ♥
---
Hahahaha, the Gods forbid I get to live that long, thank you for your good whishes tho ♥
---
Same, Core Tyria needs a good revamp, it's quite abandoned, hard to come back to it after experiencing the joy of the expansion zones.
---
how do i delete someone elses post?
---
Yeah I agree that it's too short and if I was intentionally recording it for this purpose I would have made it longer,  I was just recording the intense battle between the drake and the risen for fun and accidentally captured the risen running after him at the end
---
Can GMs whisper people appearing offline? I appear offline when I play, although I'm too lazy to do farming that looks like botting, but it seems easy for a botter to avoid whispers by appearing offline.

Razah was eventually changed into having a dynamic profession setting wasn't he? Togo was one of my favorite characters in the original franchise by far.

Sell sell sell.
---
1) Silk and Mithril is essentially trash when it comes to TP costs. It's more effective to vendor light and some heavy blue gear than it is to salvage them.
---
2) Don't bother if you don't have way to boost MF to like 600-800% (even tho I'm not sure will that work as the item says "account bonus" not character bonus)
---
3) green gear might drop you charms or symbols but it's so low chance you probably get more sustained money by selling the unid gear than gamble opening and salvaging them and getting 8c more and 20c silk scrap..
---
Your confusing the events as the complaint its not, its how faceroll the core content is and how fast it is to level, the base leveling is not very interesting because of the lack of depth for ability customization as well but 80 plus is where its allot of fun because masteries and unlocking your elites.
---
I'm a little late, but you're running Sigil of Force on both sword and focus. They don't stack. Don't overwrite the sigil, it costs 4g. It's worth waiting til you get a black lion salvage kit to guarantee you get the sigil back when you salvage.
---
I'm going to guess you bought the focus since you're new. The focus called "Adam" is less than half the price and has the same stats as the pearl conch. You should use the filters to search for gear with power, precision &amp; ferocity instead of searching for stuff named "berserker's". It'll save you some gold in future.
---
Damn really? Made a good choice then. Sounds awesome. 
---
The leveling process can feel tedious if you are trying to get absolutely everything done. The hearts themselves can be boring to do, so I prefer to look at those as hubs for exploration, around which you can find points of exploration and events
---
The expansions do come with a boost to level 80, but I'd recommend not using that immediately, as suddenly opening up everything at once can be a little overwhelming, especially since expansion content is noticeably more difficult.
---
At level 30, you do get access to the first dungeon, which might be more interesting to you to do.
---
Typically both expansions can be bought for around $45 without a sale in total, but you can also look on other websites (there's a list on the arenanet website, dlgamer is a popular one), which might have their own sales. We don't know when the next sale might be, but I'd assume around April (next episode of living world)
---
Living world is just the content packs between expansions. You unlock them either by purchasing them (in game currency or real money), or by being online during their release window (about 3 months long between each episode)
---
If you want the story, then you need all of them. In terms of gameplay, all of season 3 and 4 introduce new maps and content, while season 2 is mostly just story. Season 3 is better for gearing up at level 80, season 4 gives other benefits like the Istan farm (gold farm that actually just got nerfed), and mount masteries
---
Anhai stream lul

Just respond with a null string. Nothing could possibly go wrong.
---
I actually feel like they're far too difficult to break. Given that you're only stunned for a couple of seconds when it's broken, it can be an absolute pain to shut down someone with a banner unless they're being really reckless. Most groups i've run with will mark up any banner holders they spot immediately, so that they can actually be singled out for sniping, otherwise they just never go down.
---
If we don't kill Kralkatorrik, we're all screwed. So the hope is that, yes, Aurene can take his power and maintain the magical balance
---
It's a tournament. Not a participation event like the beetle race. Yes everyone has a chance to win this since there are no qualifying points required to enter. No I don't think people like yourself will win because you're not good enough. The people who want to win will put in the effort.
---
&gt;Because Aurene can absorb the magic that his death would cause
---
Exactly, however early in the episode it is explained that Kralkatorrik is winning the war in the mist, meaning if he isn't stopped soon he will devour an entire metaphysical plain of existence.
---
Its stop him now and hope Aurene can do what she was born to do, All or nothing.
---
Does your Instance Manager work?

&gt;:3c become one with the pink glitter class

because it would be cool as fuck if it were implemented.

Thank you for letting me know this exists
---
Entirely like that, yes
---
Rifle Deadeye perfect rotation is fairly demanding, but a very relaxed casual rotation that benches maybe 2k less is basically smash your face on keyboard easy. Just because SnowCrows call it "hard" doesn't mean that you need to use their perfect rotation. 
---
A lot of dots would move to that zone?
---
Ever been in a big guild around Teq or TT time? Same exact thing really, just slightly fewer dots.
---
I agree, it probably is working as intended, but that doesn't mean it couldn't work better.

Would recommend getting Magi’s instead if you’re using LS3 trinkets as tenporary replacements - your groups will probably want to stay alive more than they want perfect 25might+fury uptime. Death is a DPS loss.

Trojan horse. Build it, park it outside enemy keep, enemy takes it inside, entire squad bursts out.

It's an instance bug. For sur. Few days ago, a dev finally stated here in reddit that the team will work on it asap to find a fix. They are looking for what can be the origin. And they'll add it to their issue webpage. 
---
I'll edit with links in few seconds.
---
Not all Elder Dragon power, but one Elder Dragon's power. The plan was for Glint, Vlast, Aurene, and three unknowns (to us?) to replace the Elder Dragons, one for one.
---
I see nothing wrong with this. In fact, I see nothing at all.
---
So strong your interrupts get interrupted.
---
Basically, we need Elder Dragon replacements. Balthazar could not fulfill that role, Aurene can. It's more than simply getting rid of the magic in the world, otherwise we wouldn't have needed to stop Balthazar or we could just kill Kralkatorrik in the Mists. It's the balance of The All and the six spheres tied to it - killing Elder Dragons imbalances The All, so does one Elder Dragon becoming far stronger than the rest according to Taimi during the PoF epilogue.
---
We decide that the time is now to kill Kralkatorrik during A Star to Guide Us because of two reasons:
---
1. Aurene has undergone the steps required to become an Elder Dragon.
---
2. Kralkatorrik is tearing apart reality while inside the Mists.
---
The second one is the real clincher, else we'd probably focus on getting a replacement up and running for Mordremoth and/or Zhaitan if possible.
---
&gt;but am I missing any concrete evidence that Aurene 100% has the capacity to absorb an ELDER dragon's complete power? 
---
That's the purpose of the trails at the beginning of All or Nothing. It's the final steps she needed to become capable of replacing Kralkatorrik. When they end, you'll notice she's now glowing.
---
Chronomancer is now able to break the fourth wall by using continuum split to revert to a prior build of the game.

The normal one is still glossy :( it does look nice, but it would loo even better matte.

I am unable to swap accounts using the small menu that appears with the list of active accounts inside.

Don't do that

This is a consequence of the recent "lighting fix" on the racing scarf, before it used dye without the sheen, but now any darker dyes don't look anywhere close to black.

I really don't understand why they made the fix.

Coolbeans. Would you recommend just purchasing Season 3 and 4 and watching a recap of 2, based on the statement it’s just story?
---
Nothing beats a spectral walk when fooling people on Red map when jumping from a cliff 😁
---
I'm very satisfied with reaper roaming, only heavy sustain warriors or hardcondi mirages are my Problems. 
---
Damn, GW1 is still a beauty... Guess who's installing right now.
---
If you want achievement points and some mastery points (unlocked with the expansions), then go ahead and get season 2 as well
---
But if you don't care so much, then you could probably just find a recap.
---
And if you want season 2 later, you could probably just farm gold to buy it
---
What is a good way to practice heal/boon druid rotation for a total druid noob? I do a lot of T4 fractals on other classes, but I want to learn druid for fractals and possibly raids. Normally I'd go to the golem to learn the rotation, but that doesn't work with druid CA requiring more players.
---
Did you even bothered to watch his 3 parts videos about the comparison when it was against the mossman? Or you just self centered self proclaimed top player who just distorts facts and misinform people with math in a void?

People want to see Mirage nerfed because its unfun to play against and not exclusively for being OP.
---
If i think of playing PvP, i always ask myself: Do i realy want to deal with 1-2 enemy mesmer today? 
---
Would that be fun for me?
---
Answer: No. 
---
Doesnt matter if you win or loose. 
---
If your first thought after the fight is: Pfffff... that was fucking annoying. I dont want to do that again.
---
Then you know something is wrong.
---
same issue here
---
When a pawn or a knight (what the pawn transforms into when it reaches the end) enters a tile it claims it for its side and thus turn it orange independently of when you claimed it for your side.
---
On thing you can do is delay a claim if you know a pawn is about to enter a tile so that you don't waste it. 
---
For example, one way to deal safely with Knights is to wait for them to come to your tile and to "pull" them near the center of a tile (to avoid the Knight from going out-in-out-in moves near the edge) and then claim the tile, that way you can safely kill it without risking your tile to be reclaimed right away.
---
Coolbeans. Any other advice on what to purchase, perhaps? And are there any integral rewards to progression in S2, then?
---
aNet: "We continued our on-going streamlining and necromancer skills no longer crititally hit. Instead, they are buffed by 5% damage. Maybe in few years we will move to other classes"

That. Is. Fucking. Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It  is all down to anet claiming that armors take "months" to make as compared to outfits. Which, sorry, anyone who ever opened a modeling program can tell you is a lie, or incompetence.

On a side note, the way you talk about clicking every single bag and alavaging the items, I wonder if you're familiar with the open all and salvage all functions?  It's not a 2 click process, but it's not tedious either.
---
I need healing!
---
Awesome art! I actually really appreciate the edgy style of the characters; you definitely have your own unique style of face and body shape, shading style, etc. It's refreshing to see something new!
---
When any jade scout (small ones that only move) OR the jade soldiers move into a tile they activate it. This only happens when they enter the tile but will happen again if they leave and come back.
---
Gotta be honest, I don't think you know what you're talking about here. 
---
unlimited potential 
---
Yeah this is what happened. Thanks!
---
Kralkatorrik is going to "devour reality itself". Even without Aurene we have to try and stop him anyway :x
---
Chrono.   
---
End me.
---
I play in the same room as my girlfriend, and we might talk about it in person and then just carry on, and seeing how ArenaNet treats suspected cheaters this is scary!
---
Take a look!
---
How tf is 2 minstrel 2 harrier usual?
---
reposted here a way around to make it work again i found. look for my comment in this thread or search keyword: ui switcher
---
I wanna see  the front of this fashion.
---
Once again, asura continue to look better in art than they do in-game.
---
Amazing work!
---
&gt; There doesn't seem to be a fix though...
---
thats because players rather post it on reddit than submitting a bug report or a CS ticket
---
Absolutely brilliant
---
That and I think the PvP version has a duration of 5 or so seconds with a 90s recharge.
---
Just stow your jugg like any other reasonable person. Not like hammers will be meta any time soon.
---
PoF zones have shit lighting, so I expect it to be washed out. Having juggernaut gives you an appreciation of the older maps. Especially ascalon and the black citadel where the lighting is glorious.
---
I think the easiest way would searching in the banks  wardrobe, where you see all possible pieces of chest armor
---
Hello,
---
for now they nerf farms - Silverwastes, then Auric Basin and now Istan, so prices will stagnate for some time. In the past Anet added ascended stuffs - so wood, ore, clothes and leather went up, then they added ecto gambling and the last was guild hall - some T materials went up + flowers and herbs.  
---
So they have to come up with brand new idea, something what everyone would need and what everyone could afford. Then they can use for crafting/creating cheapest materials in huge volume to pump their prices up.
---
If arcdps starts hidden, there is zero graphics drawed, you need to init imgui at start to be shure it uses correct PSO and have zero effect on rendering.
---
and be shure that you not changing any render states outside of imgui code, cause any get/stateblocks not working
---
[Maybe it is this one?](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Luminous_armor_(medium))

M I N I 
---
HI thanks, I hope i will be able to make some this Saturday.
---
The probability of each chest doesn't improve, but you get more chests in higher tiers.
---
Riding on a skimmer ...oh the possibilities!
---
I always saw an angry duck so now I'm kinda disappointed
---
Could be used in mounted combat, those 1-5 skills feel empty man :)
---
They'd better release new elite specs and gamebreaking mechanics like gliding and mounts in the future, expansion or not. Or the game will slowly die.
---
Ask them i you can join.
---
Actually rigid sylvari animation makes sense, they are kinda.. wood ;P
---
Essentially an imaginary fight.

My man! Gonna test tonight, if it's even better than the last version, I'm giving you another tenner!
---
you wondering about a bug that is here for months?  
---
what about all the bugs that still exist in CoreGame-Dungeons?  
---
What?
---
LOL Okay so this is our standards for balance now?  
---
If I don't have fun fighting Deadeyes in virtually stealth should that be nerfed?  
---
"Warrior passive healing is pretty unfun to have to tolerate."  
---
"Holo and Scourge has to many AoEs that flood points, this isn't fun!"  
---
"Rangers always have such an annoying pet, and it's unfun having to fight a target with something so persistent nipping at your heels for decent damage! it should be removed."  
---
"OMFL This Ele healed to full for the 3rd time even though I got it so low, this isn't fun! I don't want to do this!"  
---
"OMFGWTFBBQ That Guard just warped through the floor up here to kill me! This isn't fun to fight against!"  
---
"This DareDevil has way to many dodges! I can't land anything yet his attacks close gaps and do so much damage! This so isn't fun to fight against!"  
---
Just because I have to think more to kill a mirage doesn't make it any more unfun than anything else, and the claims of being OP is just people who really don't understand what they are fighting.  
---
This is now how we balance, also what about all the people who do find mirage fun to fight?
---
This. Build diversity in PvE is in the hands of the player base mostly, and only in Anets to a much lesser extent. There will always, always be optimal builds and DPS rotations. The players choose whether they want to obsess over it or show flexibility and realize so much is viable unless you go for speed clear records.
---
Another huge point is - if you say they should balance for PvE because bigger playerbase, what does that mean? Because funnily enough what people often mean by that is balance for raids, when raiders themselves are a tiny section of the PvE base, probably at this point not a bigger player base than PvP and definitely not WvW. If people want balance for the majority then you balance for open world casuals, is that what people want? To balance the game around content you can get through with yellow clerics gear and builds that make no sense?
---
PvP is competitive. Poor balance negatively affects players' experience. 
---
This is happening a lot more lately. I've been "semi-afk" farming for over a year. The first year i only got one GM interaction to verify me being at my system. That was worrying.  
---
The last two months i got moved a couple of times and i'd say that's a good thing!
---
Now I got the reference.. thank you for saving my sanity
---
Username checks out
---
Oh no, I mean they make me want to stop playing a Mesmer. 
---
:^)
---
Same, I really like the male sylvari animation. Very precise, economical.
---
Thanks so much for all your hard work which will allow me to keep using your great program again without having to copypaste my account details in 8 + launch windows.
---
Wait, is it? I don't really know what Mesmer was like in PvE in the final years of GW1 as I mostly played PvP in the years leading up to GW2's release, but Mesmer's design was highly PvP oriented in GW1. I remember for the first couple of years it was basically an unwanted class in a lot of PvE content and was definitely the least played in PvE.
---
Mesmer design in GW1 was perfect though. The ultimate high skill floor, high skill cap shut down and mind games class. The best mesmers were a joy to spectate in GvG's. What they did to the class in GW2 is an absolute crime, it shares the flavor and almost none of the gameplay.
---
The Asura are perfect for a neo-noir expansion or LS episode. Races across the city, existential crisis, dramatic lighting, gray morality. 
---
That was a really interesting read. I've had the keyboard for a while though, and it seems the issue is fixed after having deleted all related files and doing a fresh install. If you don't mind explaining I'm interested to hear what IRQ is as well :)
---
Just another deception from the matrix 👀
---
Do I need to boost a character in order to get taxied through that first story instance tho? Great idea btw! 😄
---
Engineer?
---
Qadim CM is a lot easier than Dhuum CM because Qadim's CM mechanic is a lot more predictable than Dhuum's. Dhuum requires you to be constantly aware of your surroundings and the Echo's location whereas Qadim CM is scripted to the point where you don't really need to have that level of awareness at all times.
---
Ahah Nice :) 
---
Well thought of!
---
So was Brodak Steelstar! As soon as Caithe said we were going north, I was pretty certain we'd be going to Thunderhead Keep.
---
As far as I'm concerned, anywhere along the Brand is fair game for Episode 6, and possibly anywhere else seeing as Kralk can TP to friend now. But, just along the current Brand, I can think of 4 interesting locations for a map - Wizard's Folly is the LEAST likely of these 4, but even so I reckon there's a couple compelling points it has in its favor. It's my favorite though, so I wrote some fan-fiction on the internet about it. The Tombs of Drascir, just east of Iron Marches is the next least likely, but it's also the place I have the least information on so I'm probably not going to say too much about it; other than "man, Odran REALLY liked putting portals in Tombs didn't he?"
---
Really looking forward to season 1 since i missed it
---
Keep up the good work!
---
I really don't know if it's important or not. But what i know is that we came here to farm icy lodstones for Nicholas Sandford. We came here to xp eventually and find some wolf to tame... But then, nothing. We never came back and we never heard a word again about this beautifull building. So i just presume it's not an important location in the Tyrian Lore. But i can be wrong. ;-)
---
That would explain 
---
It literally destroys the game(mode) so YES.
---
Like many others said: You guys can have fun playing Mirage Vs Mirage all day long.
---
The gamemode PvP is simply not fun to play.
---
We can discuss actuall balance when all the cancer is out of the game.
---
Maybe then more people would see PvP not as a giant Joke.
---
IIRC there have been map background alterations on tthe south-western corner of the Charr Homelands, so I presume that's where we're going next.
---
Thanks
---
You can roleplay your way into a guild?
---
all of Personal and Living Story is "EZMODE" ;P
---
Classic WvW guild.
---
improvise, adapt, overcome
---
Sounds like wvw guild. They often have strict rules, often psychorigid. If I dared a generalization, I'd also say often childish/led by young people.
---
I was in one like that a few years back. There was a minimum number of raids you had to participate in per week (3). I participated 4-5 times a week. Buuuut ... sometimes I rather play pve as the filthy pveboy I was (I was the guy playing the whole game, others only cared about wvw, mostly). Drove them mad. Others participated in 3-4 raids a week, while spending other evenings on other games. No problem. I tried to explain them that playing another part of gw2 was basically the same as playing another game entirely, as far as raid participation was concerned ; and that I was more than respecting the raid/week rules. But it was beyond their brain's logic capabilities.
---
Better up that bloodtinge stat lmao

Walker was Great, I remember my SPS and SE got a whole conversation in White Chat to Look like real Player.
---
group of friends for over 6 years, definitely one of the most lax least toxic WvW guilds i've ever been a part of.
---
Helo everyone, 
---
I'm a new player, I've been playing for a month or so, I just hit 80 ( Ranger ), and as you'd expect, I'm a bit lost when it comes to gear and builds,  I checked some guides and builds on metabattle and snow crows, it's usefull, but a bit overwhelming for a new player. What I'd like to focus on right now is exploring so can you guys give me some advice on a good open world builds ? 
---
As for gear, I barely have 18g, so I can't afford anything fany, so in what order should I upgrade ? Are named armor sets worth it ? What's best for open world, Shortbow or longbow ( I'm not a fan of a full melee ranger tbh).   
---
you can watch an animated reolay of the fight at the dps.report webpage if u have the arcdps log
---
Getting it in 2 months 8) Hype!
---
I once watched a branded soldier go completely out of his way just to kill a poor defenseless prairie dog :(
---
Those are the mastery related ones, and have nothing to do with the map, but is about the tribe.
---
Welp. I loved hammer DH :(
---
Nope. No need to boost. But beware, at low levels u will die so fast, so its all on the other player to clear the level. Though its a pretty easy stage. 
---
Didn't like it personally but objectively, it's not bad. 
---
Holy moly, the toxicity in this thread is real!
---
While I see that it might not have been the most thought through action, I do understand it and respect it. Also reading through your responses, I see that there is a lot more to it, that we don't get to know, which is fine.
---
I do however feel sad about the sudden departure of [gw2tool.net](https://gw2tool.net) since I used it pretty much every day - but therefore I am really happy to see, that you made it open source, so I can try to run it on my home server.  
---
Additionally I'd like to thank you so much for developing such a wonderful tool!
---
What? I love the way asura moves and they are my first choice of race at any point. I am pretty picky about this things even and can reject games for bad movements.
---
The only movements that annoys me in the game is the Norns, not because they are bad really, but because they feel slow and it makes thump thump thump thump noices. 
---
Since I haven't gotten a clear answer, I'd like to craft the shining blade twice. Is that possible, or does it fall in that category?
---
Thanks!
---
who knows maybe they'll soon nerf SW too. that would be nice, wouldn't it?
---
If you can do it in SW for similar results, then do that. The only reason to be doing Istan would then be because you actually enjoy the content, and thus the amount of loot you recieve shouldn't be as important.
---
How dare you, i'm offended now.
---
maybe because off the longer time investment needed for SW and thinking diminishing returns is good enough on SW
---
The Shinig Blade was released after Heureka and is also one of the 2.5 Legendaries, which means: yes, you can craft it twice.
---
&gt; easy to get into?
---
Yes. easy especially since you have experience with wow. But one key difference when you start is, gw2 is a semi-sandbox experience. Don't expect quests to guide you. You go where you please. Do what you want to. Explore. Take part in a dynamic result based event chain, which will take u across the maps. Everything rewards you with experience. Its Free to Play so you can check out by downloading it right now.
---
&gt;friendly community?
---
I would say very friendly. People have accused this player base of being carebears and being too nice. As if that's a bad thing! Anyways, if you see players with Red apple sign on top of them, they are Mentors who volunteer to help other people out. And if you can't find them, you can wiki anything directly from the game chat  and gw2 wiki is very powerful. If nothing helps, just ask in map chat or in reddit.
---
Shinies !
---
And they fall for it every time 
---
you don't know how hard i'm holding back my inner edgelord RN
---
Hi, welcome. I am not a ranger main so take this with a pinch of salt.
---
The longbow/GS option in metabattle is a good start for open world. It gives u the ranged attack and GS slowly will teach u melee. Melee is essential if you want to partake in end game content (raid/fractal) because of how boons work in this game. The bear pet is also very tanky to ensure u survive almost everything that's thrown ur way. Ranger is actually one of the easiest classes to start gw2 for new player.
---
You can get named gear (Zhed's Armor) . They have the same stats as their unnamed counterparts, but named set is much cheaper on TP. With 18 gold you should be able to gear considerably well as each named armor piece goes for 2 gold. 
---
You can do your dailies for 2 gold, tequatl the world Boss for another 2 gold, the HoT Meta events for easy materials and "Amalgamated Gemstones" - another 4 gold. (You can sell your materials in bank for gold, Though I do NOT recommend this short sighted approach)
---
If you have access to HoT, playing the Verdant Brink Night Meta event will get you a Bladed Armor box once a day. Play it for 6 days and you have a full set of berserker armor set. Not spending one gold. Though you need to find a commander doing the event. 
---
And scrapper support is viable now as well! 
---
Great job on these, I loved the LW1 recap.
---
Can we get armor like this? :) minus the scarf since we have that.
---
You'll need to do the map clear on a second character or take the POF route for your second shining blade
---
 Behind there Wild hunt dogs! scary stuff
---
Try power dragonhunter, in my opinion this class can give You so much fun.
---
I have two mesmers, a Power and a Condi.
---
Try Power Dragonhunter and Power Daredevil.
---
Battle moose!
---
All armor skins do this, it's a limitation of having the chestpiece basically being one piece and replacing the actual chest.
---
I immediately thought the same, really bad it won't appear in wardrobe. Got mine last month and must say it's the best birthday thing so far.
---
then i'll advise you to look up some guides/ take classes on hiding your accent
---
It is really bursty in pvp. I ahve been playing boonbeast this season and a rev +1 is the thing I watch out for the most.
---
Will do somehow :D ^^ 
---
Read it from left to right :)
---
*Choyas FTFY
---
of course everybody is wearing it, it just came out, that's not the fault of it being an outfit that's the fault of ppl being basic.
---
it's obvious that outfits are either easier to make and/or sell better
---
Uhm.. Not using Clone/Phantasm Skills while having 3 Clones up (and both Cds on MW) is stupid. You should always aim for using SW5 and GS4, GS2 off cooldown. The amount of dps both phantasms are doing and the amount of might you gain by GS2 is not even compareable to MW, with waiting to get it off cooldown b4 using Clones again. 
---
No it really hasn't,the vast majority of ele players however have eternally been shit at the game and refuse to adapt to their environment and ask anet to buff them so their environment adapts to their bad play styles
---
It... works from time to time
---
Don't you think people would be less "basic" if they had the choice to mix outfits? 
---
 Yes, it has some engaging gameplay, I will give it a shout one day.
---
That's awesome, thanks for sharing !!
---
Well if there is access to hot, why not Reaper? And if fractals why not power?
---
Give your miserable life meaning again. Play holo
---
You're more or less limited to stats sets that don't have Concentration/Boon Duration as Necro doesn't output as much boons than other supports or healers can (and even then the re-application of the limited boons they can supply aren't something to write home about either) which rules out Plague Doctor or Seraph stats as they have boon duration, and since you're leaning more towards support than actually dealing damage (though you'd still want to be maximizing your damage whenever possible without giving up your support or utility) stats like Marshal or Shaman would be better for damage-oriented support Necro, while something like Magi would be better suited for a pure support Necro (for example the MightyTeapot Scourge build).
---
As a heal Scrapper, run towards me!
---
&gt; engaging gameplay
---
drop trap, spin, ???, everything's dead
---
Is this the plot twist in your plot armor?
---
Probably, yeah
---
It's significantly lower damage that melee weapons. So you could but you most likely won't be doing enough damage for end game 
---
That's lighting
---
Not making xpac is basically just brainfuck dumb. Sales showed a boost for the last 2 times
---
Yes you can; it just depends on how good of a DPS weapon you're using in group content. To keep the focus on Ranger, longbow doesn't do good DPS up close, and isn't a particularly good DPS option compared to Greatsword or Sword in PvE (it has some utility that makes it good for solo PvE, and is bursty enough for PvP). 
---
Shortbow, on the other hand, does great in melee. One of its damaging skills shoots poison arrows in a fan at your target. The skill in practice works similar to a shotgun, where the closer you are the more arrows you're able to land on a target. 
---
As long as you're close enough to receive boons and support if you're in trouble, using ranged weapons isn't inherently bad as long as they're true DPS options, or providing good utility if you aren't DPS. As a general rule of thumb; melee will do more damage than ranged due to the lack of safety that ranged provides, so getting used to melee weapons will allow you to do better DPS and will help you get better at the game overall. 
---
Considering that dhuum is one of the easiest bosses to find an opener for(as alot cant clear it), I'd say its not that inconvenient. 
---
Thank you for giving your time to me :)) &lt;3
---
Are you really such a braindead individual? Of course the buffs added by Anet would be situational and not limited to vit + toughness. For Dhuum that means that failing greens does not kill you or wipe the party.
---
... I don't know what either of you is taking about. Could you elaborate? 
---
Now thats the kind of money I wish I had T^T. Take that upvote tho!
---
I partialy agree with everyone.
---
Yes more mix and match is welcome and an opportunity to be less "basic"
---
Yes, I dont think the majority would make use of it, sadly
---
Yes ppl stack those effects and lush colors way too much in my opinion

Sorry Fred
---
It's safe to make a macro for that.
---
TP is limited so I can't buy them tho I have collected a vast sum of gold(\~30k) same goes for crafting I suppose need to farm every single resource but will give it a try.
---
We had like 50 people gathered there last night trying to push the map into making a second shard but it didn’t work. Not sure what the number would have to be but that’s the only known fix until they roll a new game build.
---
Gonna be a long time but if its worth it to get Ascended gear from Tailoring then I better start farming up since can't use TP.
---
My main problem in this case is the fact that, because of people using lush colors, Anet shouldn't release outfit as skins? That's nonsense, if people like to wear a rainbow on em, why shouldn't they like it with a larger pool of skins? 
---
If I ask around wouldn't that be begging and prohibited?? I would love it if there is a person with an extra key but don't want to impose myself.
---
Take the files (all the files) not associated with gw2 out of the directory. 
---
Launch the game 
---
Load in to a map 
---
Quit the game 
---
Put all files back in to the directory although this time, put these files in the main directory:
---
d3d9.dll
---
"Allyourpresets".ini
---
Run game. 
---
Open gw2 hook with shift + f2 
---
Navigate to settings 
---
Locate your shader folder and texture folder within the app. 
---
Reload hook (click the reload button in the gui) 
---
Should work now
---
After I collected the cadalbolg reward, and if I want another asc weapon, do I need to craft it or can I get it other ways too? I got armor on 500 and only need 1 more item, but good god, this is a lot of money down the hill. 
---
they can hop into any instance
---
Woops, sorry for reviving dead thread for a moment, but as a F2P, how much progression can I get before finally needing to get the expacs? Wondering since I don’t know when the next sale is.
---
It will sound dumb but whever my rotation is at the autoattack part...I spam the autoattack button and god does my finger hurts after long hours of playing...dont do like me, its called autoattack for a reason x)
---
You... you don't wring out your arm after using it?
---
thanks &lt;3 I appreciate your kind words x
---
But what about my [Ooze buddy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Chromatic_Ooze)?
---
Nice bug lol
---
&gt;everything's dead
---
That's the engaging part!
---
Judge better be alive, he's my guy, he let me out of there if I ran an errand for him. I dont want him to die.
---
Maybe not your arm
---
Look natural to me
---
Okay thank you! Sounds really tedious though :D
---
Visual Basic is the worst.
---
everything is a dildo if you're brave enough...
---
You are an encyclopédie ! My good that's impressive.
---
Take this as a real compliment. :-)
---
For me, the golem could be the start of something you're right. With the Forgotten involved. But why so far from Elona ? Could be great. I really miss this place, the Wizard Foly. Let's hope the guys who write the story didn't forgot about what you found. Send your researches to them... ASAP !!! XD 
---
That Norm just had bad arm cramps while playing.
---
I don't know about open world viability, but as a mesmer main I got into Condi Renegade. The build is really fun and deep. Plus I think my Rev is adorable so ...
---
Whats that blue? 😍😍
---
What do you mean... Mesmer was nerfed unjustifiably /s
---
Dudeeee that was freaking awesome! Do EET!
---
Enameled Sky aka bae. Pretty much all the enameled colors are awesome ;3
---
Nice post, but I don't think that zone is likely in any way whatsoever. Don't get me wrong, I still think that area has a lot of potential, but I'm not sure it's going to happen now.
---
This potential zone has two key landmarks, which have always made me consider it for the future:
---
* **Temple of Lyssa:** If the Balthazar-Lyssa connection is expanded upon, the temple in the mountains could prove vital for the plot.
---
* **Ascalonian Wizard's Tower:** We have several hints about the Krytan Wizard's Tower being next in line for a raid. The plot could easily link both wizard towers at once.
---
Those two landmarks almost guarantee the potential zone is going to happen some day, unless the plot really drifts away from the current situation.
---
Still, I think these 3 are the best candidates, sorted by priority:
---
* **Ruins of Surmia:** Northeast of Ascalon, right under the brand. There's a portal to the Mists there, similar to the one from the Tomb of the Primeval Kings. It's location in Ascalon would make it a good introduction for a Blood Legion plot, which I think is very likely.
---
* **The Desolation 2:** Gathering the surviving forged to fight alongside us has been a popular theory since Zafirah was introduced. This potential zone could be either south or west of the Desolation, south having more potential because of GW1 landmarks and Kralkatorrik's mountain. Said mountain could become a key plot element, having a permanent portal to the Mists created by Kralkatorrik himself.
---
* **Charr Homelands:** Far north of Ascalon, this was Kralkatorrik's bedroom before he woke up. It's a huge GW1 landmark, and it's going to be used sooner or later. Would be a good introduction for a Blood Legion plot too.
---
Just my few cents.
---
It is a solid choice too, but I feel a bit lazy.
---
😂
---
&gt;In retrospect, if you look at some of the episodes, they only made sense because the plot forced them to make sense.
---
Yep, this is a problem with GW2 storytelling, everything feels kinda "made up on the spot", and makes predictions really hard.
---
Both Sandswept Isles and Jahai Bluffs were complete asspulls in these regards, impossible to predict without leaks or world map changes. Even with the Inquest hints in Istan, who did really expect to see Rata Primus to be actually a thing? The most people expected after seeing the map changes was some kind of ancient asuran city. Hell, I'd say asura were totally out of place during the whole storyline.
---
Same for Jahai, it was only made relevant because the Elonians decided to host a meeting there, and then surprise, Kralkatorrik decided to attack.
---
The reason why we went to Thunderhead Peaks, Glint's secret forge, was made up on the spot. The forge could have been anywhere else, Thunderhead Peaks taking a few years more to be relevant, in some campaign to help the surviving dwarves against Primordus.
---
:0
---
You can, but remember you get two weapons. A ranged weapon and a stronger melee weapon is a good idea. Do as much damage from range as you can, then switch to your melee weapon. Melee weapons often have defensive skills like blocks and stuns, which can be very useful. 
---
Lake Doric. Turns out Wolves are Royalists.
---
I wish I had as much time on my hands as you
---
I'm surprised you considered Surmia/Drascir, where there's a legit portal to the Mists, but then took that idea and moved it somewhere else.
---
Dyes are technically classed by materials as well, but in the hero panel they are sorted by rarity by default. You can change it to sort by material.
---
I'm looking to get Ascended gear, gold is not problem got \~30k, but the F2P TP restriction really hurt the crafting.
---
Yeah I know, I probably explained it in an unclear manner as english isnt my language, but yes its true you can do it as well in gw2.
---
Thats why a gm thought he was botting. Doing it for that long is not normal.
---
I'm not sure what you're refering to, because almost everything (especially when it comes to leveling up a crafting profession and ascended materials) is cheaper when you buy the raw mats and craft everything yourself. It's just going to take some time of diligently crafting the daily-gated materials yourself.
---
Glad you like it. :)
---
The reason we don't have gemstore alerts on gw2efficiency is that they are not in the official API, which means that someone has to fill in a big sheet of "available" items and update them every time there is an update. If there is enough interest for that the community might be able to crowdsource that.
---
I really want to see this get changed to a more pronounced icon in game, like on April fools
---
Stat wise there is 0 difference between ascended and legendary, just so you know.
---
Is it broken in 1.8.5…?
---
Aaah, that makes sense! I just assumed there was an API.
---
I'd definitely love to see it if there is the interest. Even when I'm actually playing, I don't always remember to check what's available. If I'm taking a break for whatever reason though, there are so many items that pop up for only a week or so that I totally miss.
---
The amount of time I was waiting for the Lava Lounge pass was just insane, lol. I wasn't playing the last time it appeared, and the alert thankfully meant I didn't miss it.
---
Never take the PoF route... It's so much worse x.x
---
a Friend ^^^^^^^^^hoe on discord complained that they heard an odd noise in gendarran fields and so multiple people investigated it and i managed to capture it on recording. I'm aware that there's a water tunnel under there but i highly doubt it would make this kind of noise. Anyone know what the noise might be coming from?
---
A very easy method to abuse it would be:
---
- Fill some inventory slots with almost empty stacks of the materials you do want.
---
- Fill the rest of your inventory with full stacks of the results you do not want.
---
If the bags contains something you do want it is added to your existing not full stacks. If it contains unwanted results the opening would not execute.
---
your account needs Jesus 
---
you can never go wrong with ranger
---
If it were a swamp-triggered sound effect, I doubt it triggered so far away. With mounts not part of the core game and the core game not heavily altered for mounts, you likely triggered a client-side sound effect near the edge of the swamp that, without a mount, would be expected to play within \~10' of the swamp even running away.
---
they can be offensive and defensive at the same time. Also that annoying trait in dueling that gives them projectile reflect for 2s every time they dodge, it's like anet just wants you to get down on you knees and wait for death if you are vs mirage.
---
Probably easier to just craft another gen1 legendary sword, should be cheaper/faster if bought and you can just reskin.
---
Named armor sets will work well into 95% of the content. 
---
Its just not used for fractals because you can put agony resistance into your gear unless its acsended. 
---
Even raids are fine with exotics. 
---
Check for power main stat and ferocity and precision secondaries. 
---
This would have been it, but the audio only triggers when you pass by that spot, if you stop or turn around the audio does not play.
---
There are some during a event. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Help_First_Haven%27s_residents_deal_with_the_undead
---
When you bring a champion to 25% sabetha will spawn and cast a flamewall, which can cause trouble with cannons. 
---
That area is before passing over the bridge, the noise plays well after passing over the bridge. Also the event was not active.
---
That'd be massively inconvenient.
---
Guardian
---
You're telling me human arms don't do that? Should get yourself some charr arms then.
---
When I browse this sub I feel like the only person who doesn't hoard their containers to loot all at once. Is it really that much more profitable?
---
If you feed them enough bloodstone dust.....
---
And I agree with you!
---
Happens that we're debating two diferente things here, what anet should do, and what people actually do (though they are closely related)... if I understood your question right, I think this has been discussed before and the simple conclusion was that making an outfit was faster and more profitable for anet, it would take much more time and effort to make seperate pieces and avoid clipping.
---
Not sure if this info came from anet or not but as things are right now, seems plausible sadly.
---
The UI says to enable the UI I have to complete some mission in the HoT storyline.
---
I randomly stumbled onto a guild of Charr in The Desolation that were RP'ing as members of a warband going out on patrol.  I just sorta joined in with them as they were going along.  took about an hour before any of them thought to ask "hey does anyone else see this Norn that's been following us?"
---
best part was that I wasn't just following them I was participating, delivering scouting reports, advising on the route to take etc.  Wish I could remember the name of the guild, something Warband.
---
Gw2's community is the best. Only comparable game I played is ESO where people are also very friendly. 
---
Of course youll find pvp and hardcore(and sometimes casual too but much less) pve a bit toxic but thats normal in competitive gamemodes. 
---
There is something about gw2 that makes everyone just want to help around. You dont feel like youre wasting xp or gold by stopping to help someone, you dont feel like its a hassle to stop and help someone kill a mob they are struggling with. 
---
If you have questions, ask in map chat(if you can) and you might be spammed with actual answers. 
---
So.......seahorse??
---
What do you know about norn arms?
---
OP - you should click on "reply" when replying to a comment rather than creating a whole new comment.  It looks like you're just talking to yourself.  :-P
---
I'm pretty sure the "open all" and "salvage all" just loop the same functions you trigger when doing it manually.
---
For example, there's two spaces left, so it opens a bag, but said bag gives 4 items. That's when you get the encumbered most of the time.
---
However, you can also open a bag when there's no space left. This is useful, because sometimes those bags just give you currency or more of something you already have. However, it leads to encumbered pretty often too.
---
I don't think it's easy to check, since again, it's just looping a player function. However, it would be nice to have. Generally speaking, both open and salvage all could be much better than they are now.
---
However, that's possible. In Lion's Arch were still sounds of said doors after the festival, at least the one near Fort Mariner. No idea if it's still there, but it could be any sort of inactive content.
---
Revenant is dope, a little heavier on the DPS and lower on the support in the meta, but it has support builds that are permissable. 
---
Yeah, I hear that every time I do the beetle race. It happens somewhere near the beginning. Always been wondering what it was.
---
The problem is, they don't 'roll' for what the item is until you actually 'use' it.
---
So, if it was just another piece of leather, and you already had a stack, it wouldn't be a problem - it would just go on the stack.
---
But if it was ANOTHER BLASTED DAGGER just like the 38 other daggers, but for some damn reason *they* don't stack... then it needs a new space.
---
So the cheapest fix would be to say "You can't use things unless you have at least one open slot **or** you are using the last thing in a stack.
---
Which does seem like it would be pretty simple, honestly. But then you hit the case where you open the last thing in a stack, *but* it drops two unique items.
---
The harder fix would be to know ahead of time what's going to drop, and branch accordingly, but I suspect that's a big ugly kettle of worm-eaten fish.
---
But are they having any better loot tables? I mean what's the point of all you get from them, even with 750, is green or yellow
---
1 key will turn the treb to the left and 2 should fire it no? Unless your keybinds are different.
---
I think this sound is used for "un-summons" or despawns elsewhere in the game. Might be something on those lines.
---
Hmmm never tried thief. What about survivability outside evades?
---
This
---
It doesn't bother me as a programmer because I understand the complexity that would go into such feature.
---
But it bothers me as a UX person that the popup has no "discard" option, leaving your screen in a state where you have to switch between layers to remove things from inventory, because it's obstructing parts of it.
---
Or just sell them :D
---
Exotics/ascended, altough with a very low rate
---
True. The question is what are the people buying them doing with? I guess they salvage for MF
---
How do you know OP is not doing that hmmmmm? 
---
Is it really that bad? I have two female Norn, a Mesmer and an Ele, and it does look kinda weird, but it makes sense since everyone needs to run at the same speed. 
---
To me it looks like a typical jogging animation. 
---
The slowness does bother me, which is why I think both my Norn are as small as possible to speed it up a bit.
---
I got banned for this at some point after they said in the forum it was allowed...
---
Does the same exact thing when identifying the unidentified gear drops too though.
---
Yes via the Portal Tome Scroll thingie you can buy there with Unbound Magic.
---
Honestly. I don't disagree with this. It might sound outlandish and crazy to some. But we've taken so many steps forward, the power creeps are reaching a point of certain builds crushing health bars down in seconds flat in 2 buttons sometimes.   
---
If we bring everyone down a notch, almost like an equaliser. All the volume levels come down, so you can start to pump things up which need it the most, without it being overbearing and distorted in the mix. 
---
That is one nice thing about Hellgate's equivalent of the salvage-o-matics. They had an option for that although you will run the risk of accidentally salvaging a bunch of unid gear if you don't notice an overflow.
---
There's a recipe that uses materials acquired with path of fire content.

Ty. Will delete the post 
---
Bone hurting juice
---
Alternatively figure out the maximum number of bags you can open at once without hitting encumbered and split your bags into stacks no larger than that before opening. I do it in 50s but there is a second reason for that. When splitting I only have to enter a number once per stack. The other splits I can just take the default 1:1 splits.
---
I would be thrilled with this map (even though the Blood Legion Homelands may be a more likely candidate). Lots of great lore potential in this region. Looking forward to reading through your other map idea as well, OP!
---
Do you guys encounter creepers a lot?
---
I got messaged by someone telling me my name was cute. Whatever, I said theirs was nice too. They then asked me if I like charr and told me they were a declawed cuddly charr. Stranger danger feelings immediately filled me.  
---
I also have a character who has the last name littlefoot. And someone messaged me saying they bet i have cute feet. Same stranger danger feeling.
---
Both times I got messaged I was by the bank in divinity's reach oddly enough. Is this a common thing? Like, what the hell?
---
Since im extremely busy at work, ofc I wont see this (:. Haha thanks I'll try it when I get home.
---
You can complete all maps with another character for make another 2nd legen
---
Damn, thats the "nightclub" version of the pens? Kinda feels sad haha
---
All buttons work except switching windows. However there is a workaround - Launch all accounts, restart LB and launch something to make instance manager pop up and suddenly it works.
---
This EPR is a solid 5 
---
I hope you posted that over on github so they can look into fixing it :)
---
As support scourge you can stand a little bit behind your teammates too, which makes it easier to see when blues spawn below you, and then you should have enough time to just sidestep them. 
---
Good luck! :) 
---
How long did it take to get a full stack, outta curiosity?
---
No idea how to do that :-D
---
As far as how much you can farm them yeah, but overall LS3 map items give more UM when consumed than LS4 items give VM. Berries and Oysters are 15-30 while the other 4 items are 25-50 UM. In LS4 everything except Kralk ore is only 15-25 while the ore is 3-5.
---
Yep.. would be cool to have a nightclub somewhere in the game though, given the tech an [Asuran nightclub](https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/intermediary/f/a95eab6d-3527-4332-97b8-afaabc084cc9/dbo6s2s-c00940bd-630f-411a-8565-4ecd233b27ed.jpg/v1/fill/w_1192,h_670,q_70,strp/guild_wars_2___asura_nightclub_by_cherrylights_dbo6s2s-pre.jpg) could be lit.

Epr sounds like a heart disease. We call them NCOERs.
---
Well I'll be damned. Good shit man and grats on the record (brb). Could I get you to upload a log? I did not think renegade would be this potent in solo, I'm very impressed.
---
There are several potential ways. If you have HoT and/or PoF, there may be an elite spec weapon that you want. Check the specialisation collections for that one, but I don't think that all weapon types are available that way. I'm also not entirely sure whether there are other collections that award a weapon (except a SAB collection), though quite a few award an armor piece of choice. Other ways include raid currency (no crafting required), fractal/WvW currency (either crafting or a shitload of WvW grind required), very rare drops from WvW/champ bags/mobs, or semi-rare drops from fractal chests if you do the dailies.
---
Small guilds with tight communities *wouldn't need to do that to begin with.*

What do you mean learn TIL?
---
The commander tag's top two sides are longer than the lines connect to them and longer than the lines that are being compared on the cursor tag.
---
Wow this is awesome, I for sure did not expect this!
---
Duuude. Im definitely saving that picture haha. It would be nice indeed! There used to be a way to "sneak in" a usually instanced asura lab in Kessex but I cant do it anymore, they seem to have fixed the bugs with the minis haha.
---
I get quite a few rare from blue and green UI. They're a good source of ecto. For the yellow UI, got both rare and a decent amount of exotic with good runes/sigil. Before opening them, I usually save up several stacks so maybe it's just my bias.
---
Awesome stuff man
---
&gt; The ultimate high skill floor, high skill cap shut down and mind games class. 
---
Yep that's why they weren't popular in PVE.  The Holy Trinity was a thing, and Mezzies didn't fit well into any of those roles.  But as you said about PVP- oh GOD, I still have nightmares about Diversion and Empathy!
---
So I wonder sometimes if Anet got rid of the Holy Trinity so that every class would have a chance to solo PVE.  Fine, but its effect in competitive mode is a friggin mess.
---
Thank you for your smart response. Not all people behave like you.  
---
French discussion with support if you want to make your own opinion [https://imgur.com/a/zfKJoEz](https://imgur.com/a/zfKJoEz)
---
I disagree. As a programmer, for conditionals that can lead to an error, you code assuming an error occurs, not assuming the failure condition won't occur. 
---
I hear this every time I did the beetle race in that map. It’s spoopy. No idea what it is, I’m afraid. 
---
***laughs in EU server***
---
it seems to work only with the d3d9.dll from the bin64 folder in the zip archive  
---
what are the other 3 files for?  
---
That's because you have 220 MF and you only opened a relatively small number of them. The higher the MF, the more of those you'll get.
---
Do wvw, get 2-4 each of 40 different kinds of boxes and bags, plus miscellaneous garbage armor/weapons, plus 8-10 variations of vendor trash, get encumbered every 10 minutes because you can't stop to visit a banker or merchant.
---
What OP is describing isn't an error though. It happens all the time when you auto-loot and your inventory is full. The bag opening behavior is simply componentized:
---
- Open All only understands the bag it's opening
---
- Each stage of bag opening rolls independently and doesn't know that it's happening within the context of an "Open All"
---
- Inventory bounds checking only understands the inventory state
---
- Stack limits only understand the current stack
---
There are relatively complex rules associated with *all* of this. It doesn't make any sense to tangle their logic together (e.g. inventory bounds checking and stack limits with bag opening). By keeping everything componentized, you reduce the potential error and maintenance space considerably.
---
:D I’m an optimist. 
---
*weary stare*
---
[oh no](http://webcomicname.com/)
---
Just assume every bag has the maximum number of items it could produce when coding this in.  Your making a mountain out of a mole hill.  No one's going to complain that open all left 5 inventory slots open.  They are going to hit deposit all, salvage all, and open all, again and again without even thinking about it.  
---
seems about right
---
I'm really curious what happened last year lol
---
How would you know?  Have you ever been shot in the arm??
---
Revenant is like
---
- why play base class
---
- Herald? Cool sounds like a supporNOPE NOT THIS ONE
---
- Renegade? Sounds like a damage onlNOPE IT DOES ALL ROLES REALLY GOOD
---
After year it still feels like they need to figure out what Spec has what role specifically, with the biggest violators being the Elite Specs themselves.
---
Also I dont understand why the only to quickly gain Energy back is to drop your current set of useful skills for this moment to another skillset that might not help you a lot but HEY 50 to 75 energy back.
---
Would it hurt too much to give a trait that lets us actively get Energy back while doing stuff? Dunno like dodging an attack
---
Path of Fire is a really good expansion even if the event trains can be somewhat lacking. They exist but not on the same level as silverwastes and auric basin, for example. I'd suggest going into PoF because the zones are extremely cool and the mounts are a joy to ride around on all around the world.
---
As for precursors I believe the first generation of legendaries still have cheaper precursors compared to crafting them but for gen 2 legendaries you have to craft the entire thing.
---
But you can't check for free inventory, if you don't know the content of your bag.
---
How could the system check, if you have enough space for 2 weapons and one silk (which you can stack), without knowing that the bag contains the silk? If it contains copper for example, you wouldn't have enough space in your inventory. 
---
So the system has to "open" the bag, check if it fits in your inventory and if not, has to "close" the bag again. 
---
That means the system have to save all the "already opened but closed again" contents or have to delet them and roll for new stuff, when you open the bag again. 
---
And that means either the system runs full of "this bag contains item X,Y and Z" information, which could easily cause peformance issues, or -if it rolls new, when open again- it would open a way to force certain drops. 
---
Both would be bad.
---
It isn't,  given that you're MF affects bags upon opening.
---
I do not trust humans. They look weird and smell even weirder.
---
But I do trust music. If we have to show love, I'd rather show [a few songs about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LgdRJmjNMY&amp;index=2&amp;list=PLdtEDoSATwx0quz7kh2DF6o6lX7Bq44H0&amp;t=0s)
---
I do remember reading something about Tyria and panda bears, but I cannot recall the specifics.
---
I can see why it blew up
---
Yeah there is definitely something off. The core mechanic is legend swapping but none of the core legends work together. This could be mitigated if legends could be customized with different utilities, heals, and elites. Instead, we're forced at all times pair our core legend with an elite legend because only the elite legends are flexible enough to be shared between builds.
---
I’m no cosmetologist, but I’m pretty sure that’s messed up
---
thats what happen when you hold your arm on the muffler :D
---
fb can carry harder cuz of aegis and quickness, generally it's better to not get hit in the first place 
---
Thing is, in PvP it is extremely easy to spot a bot. The same test could be used for confirmation with the risk of moving a 'live' person being essentially zero.
---
At the same time, the obvious move would be to look at the dozens of video reports by players. But nothing is gonna happen.
---
Cause 1.) Outfits are a lot easier for people who can’t be bothered. They can easily switch between outfits, no transmutations involved, and one click does it all. 2.) Can’t like the source sadly but I’m pretty sure a while back Anet devs blatantly stated that it was far easier to develop new outfits over new armour sets 3.) If they do change outfits to armour pieces, prices will likely rise. Current individual armour pieces on the gem store go for around 400 gems, having an entire armour set of the same high quality armour pieces would warrant a much higher price tag, at which point sales and revenue may go down.
---
&gt; So checking before is not useful.
---
Yes it is. It's not all about knowing exactly what will come. It's about not opening a bag when it's *already* full. For example if you open those gear bags (the ones that have 3 armor/weapon green/blue pieces and no materials), right now it can end with all 3 items in the overflow window, which means that it clearly tried to open one while the inventory was already full.
---
Checking that the inventory has at least 1 free slot *before* opening something (with the auto-open only) wouldn't completely get rid of the issue, and in some specific cases where the bag only contains mats it would stop unnecessarily, but it would still be a lot better.
---
the story is not true btw.
---
Hey! Cheers for the hard work you put in.
---
Would you mind helping me a bit with either a solution or just information. Noticed somewhere that freesync is only enabled on windowed fullscreen but hardcapped at 60? Is it somehow possible to turn the cap off to enjoy full adaptive sync?
---
Second question I have is regarding Arc. You mentioned Arc and dx12 do have errors but not regarding your code, so what do you chainload it as? Im fine with a dc or 2 per gaming sessions but I want to enjoy fruits of your work + arc.
---
Thanks! 
---
Oh?
---
Pretty sure they’re keeping that concept for legendary trinkets (aurora and the upcoming coalescence)
---
&gt;  No one's going to complain that open all left 5 inventory slots open.
---
Never underestimate a community when it comes to their quality of life features.  Also, leaving bags unopened when you still have inventory space is not an intuitive user experience.
---
soulbeast: most of your buttons have mobility baked in, you can take a spirit or other utility without losing barely any dps and stance share is op in fractals if your group is competent
---
bonus: you can make your own might fury quickness if needed, can take up to 2 almost invulns too
---
So ? Right now it opens even when the inventory has 0 free slots. See how it can have all 3 weapons in the "over flow window" when you auto-open the raid/sw bags that have 3 gear pieces per bag.
---
Of course the system can't know if bags produce 1 or 3 items, if the materials will stack or not.
---
But it's not a reason not to make a small change. If the system checks that the inventory has at least 1 free slot before opening each bag, it will drastically decrease the overflow issues. Basically, only those "3 gear pieces" bags will still regularly overflow.
---
I think it's still missing a few bits in the core profession.  
---
It's great they gave revenants the Trident, but there's much to be done left:
---
* A second core condition weapon so they can have 2 condition sets without going renegade.
---
* A second ranged weapon so core can have both weapon sets ranged. 
---
* A 1h ranged weapon so they can combine ranged weapons with offhands.
---
These three could actually be one new weapon, like a main hand throwing axe or 1h spear(javelin) that causes conditions.
---
  
---
  &amp;nbsp;
---
I really love how the trident skills have variations based on legend without having completely different skills like elementalists, and I want to see more of that in the rest of the weapons.  
---
It's not like every weapon should have completely different variations like elementalists, or even every skill have small variations like revenant trident, but I'd like to see things like 1 or 2 skills per weapons having small variations, like giving a different bonus boon or dealing a different condition depending on legend on the 3rd strike of the autoattack.
---
I would also prefer if each legend had a 4th utility skill so there can be more variation. When you see a revenant go Shiro, you will now all of his 3 utility skills. A bit of uncertainty would be better there, by having 3 out of 4 instead.
---
NO! Black Desert does something similar and it's really annoying!!
---
If you want to be optimal, soulbeast. It has super strong burst, brings frost spirit, and can do mad reflect damage against Artsariiv. Holo is fine, you aren't normally going to be turned away from PUGs and you have decent enough burst damage.
---
I wish stability was given some kind of visual indicator. A small yellow icon on the boon bar that gets immediately lost to the 10 other small yellow icons just doesn't cut it. A bit unfair that you have to play iSpy with the boon bar when trying to decide if you should CC/corrupt your target, or save it, meanwhile, you have certain shields completely ruined by the ugliness of the aegis visual that is supposedly kept there for balance reasons (even though no one really checks the player model for aegis, and there are shields that straight up obscure aegis).
---
It IS quite funny.
---
I agree that having to camp auto or swap half of your skills to get energy is frustrating. I never could get into Rev due to this reason.
---
IMO every traitline could have a unique way to give the class some energy regen. Like Salvation could have a minor trait 'Gain 1 Energy when you heal an ally (target limit 5)', or Destruction 'Gain 1 Energy when you hit a target from behind, 2 Energy when target is below 50% (1 sec ICD)' etc.
---
Yes, I know, dead post or whatever, but as one of his ¨close¨ friends from when back when, his whole point was that the community should not follow ¨The Meta¨ to a pulp because in 9/10 situations people were not skilled enough to achieve what the meta compositions did, yet still people were toxic (And still are) against certain specs or entire classes because they believed that meta was equal to ¨this is the only viable way to play¨. 
---
His whole argument against folk like you (And I have absolutely nothing against you btw, I like a lot of what you do) was that by promoting meta build / videos to get views, despite of the fact that in many situations only players that already knew how the game work and how to make proper builds themselves could use that information, you made the already bad situation (Players discriminating others in non-speedrun hardcore runs) even worse (although I don't think it was your fault, that's what he thought at the time)
---
Admittely more of a drama queen (I love you bud) GW2Brazil (GhostlyInfusion) makes the same kind of builds, but definetly not the same style.
---
Blackgate
---
"reeeeee"
---
Whatever you do, do not think about doing the pof thing with the funerary incenses. It takes forever and I really hate domain of vaabi after the second day of doing the hearts. 
---
&gt;I think it's the worse profession of the game, design-wise, with elementalist close by.
---
As an Ele main that loves Ele, I feel attacked yet I agree.
---
Did you mean to rename complete map ''d912pxy'' to d3d9\_chainload or just the d3d9.dll that comes from d12 addon? Renaming d3d9.dll from d12 addon didnt work for me. Mind helping out?
---
Thank you very much, will try and check gw2wiki!
---
Or maybe the campaign actually achieved what they wanted it to?
---
I would love if for the next expac we had new weapons introduced. I know they probably never will do such a thing for GW2 since there are easily enough weapons to rotate through for elite specs to fill out all remaining expacs, but I've totally had dreams about sweet pole-arm combat, a greataxe or a scythe in the game.
---
Considering Necromancers get Green and Black as core colors, Mesmers get Pink and Purple, Rangers get Yellow and Green, Thief gets Red and Black, Guardian gets White and Blue, etc etc, I could totally get behind Revenant effects mostly being whites and greys.
---
They draw their power from the Mists, why are the effects not *misty*?
---
Probably or Fractal 42
---
My biggest problem, as a Mesmer main, is the Mesmer's utility and versatility. DPS, power, condition, all the support - you name it. My open world build is a swiss army knife of mobility, enemy positioning, CC, reflects, condition removal, blinds, evades, invuls, the list just goes on and on.
---
I see Guardians vaporize veteran mobs in two seconds, see Thieves perma-stealthing and one-shotting mobs and players alike. Stuff I could never do with my build, even in glass gear. But I don't care about that. Portals, condition cleanse, stability, reflects, I'm always capable of supporting other people, all I have to do is switch a utility skill or two. No matter the specialization.
---
And if there is too much of a thing, I start to stack my utility. Reflecting with my focus isn't enough? Have a Feedback. Have two with Mimic. Have three with Continuum Split. Have additional Wardens via Signet of the Ether, have even more thanks to Continuum Split again. Use Disenchanter and Null Field if there are too many conditions, stack a metric fuckton of stability if need be. ALL THE SYNERGY.
---
I'll never be able to blast fields like an Elementalist or pull off whatever sorcery Engineers are capable of, I'll never have the mobility of a Thief, the sustain of a Ranger or the burst of a Guardian, but only a Mesmer allows me to be so social, versatile and self-sustaining. Portal a fellow player into the green room, completely shut down a projectile-spamming champion, and then rofl-leap from one end of the map to the other via several ambushes, Blinks and Jaunts chained together to insta-gib a cluster of trash mobs with a shatter.
---
And then troll someone with Illusion of Life.
---
Skill-wise Kaineng is stronger during early-NA but SBI will have the more competitive matchup by virtue of having off-hours.
---
Allow for racial utilities, too. They're considered "terrible" on every other class because you can swap around for better ones thoughout the entire assortment, but if I swap to Shiro and I don't often use his Heal (I already have high lifestealing without burning energy on that Utility), why can't I swap to the Racial heal with other perks?
---
Honestly its a combination of Daily Istan, daily HoT metas, daily fractals, teq and dailies. The most consistent non-daily gold farm is silverwastes with 20-25 gold per hour, if you have a bag opener. Raids are also very lucrative with up to 70 gold a week if you want to invest in them. 
---
Most of the gold options now are daily events you can do, but if you want a pure grind, either go Fractal 42 or Silverwastes.
---
The timeline is a bit tricky since they obviously can't have a year-long story mode to span a year. I've always assumed the gaps are meant to be filler; like realistically walking to some of the spots would take weeks. So in the case of Heart of Thorns, you spent days traversing the jungle between the story instances or such. But it is just weird to say an important plot detail happened during on those gaps from idle chat.
---
If we were told there are six Elder Dragons in a Pact meeting, that should have been part of the Story and not something assumed to happen off camera. Because we can just as easily assume we were exploring maps and fighting World Bosses during those time gaps, since that is literally what we do, then attending meetings that were never mentioned.
---
Fair point on the roar though. Still doesn't explain how the game pops up so suddenly. Going from "that might have been a new dragon" to "it must be Mordremoth" the very next story step, even if it spans a week, feels very out of place, especially for how poor the build up was.
---
Because of queen bee it's allways been tier one.
---
I feel like reality is fairly solid in most game modes, it's pretty godly in open world pve. Depends on what you want to use it for really.
---
You don't really pick a class in this game based on it's role because every class can fit every role. Thief for example looks like your classic selfish single target dps combo bot, but Deadeye allows him to provide the 2 strongest dps increasing buffs in the game like candy.
---
Try to pick the class for it's concept.
---
Like barbarians, samurai,knights, gladiators? Warrior
---
Like paladins, clerics, priests,spellblades? Guardian
---
Like warrior mages, monks,chaotic fighters? Revenant
---
Like aragorn, scouts, animals, nature, hunting? Ranger.
---
Like tools, gagdets, EXPLOSIONS, alchemy? Engineer
---
Like shadows, stealth, sneak attacks, acrobatics? Thief
---
Like elemental spells, classic wizards, shamans? Elementalist
---
Like illusions, deception, multicasting spells, time-space magic? Mesmer
---
Like dark magic, vampirism, cursing your foes, death magic and powers? Necromancer.
---
Reaper is at its core one of the most fun classes in the game. In terms of selling its theme through animations and skills it is genuinely my favourite class. Unfortunately, the balance team seem to have a real issue with it, and for every small buff it gets it takes a massive nerf soon afterwards. For open world play this won't matter at all, but for instanced content such as raids/fractals only the power build is really viable and only borderline at that.

Before hopping back into the game and giving Revenant a shot, I thought the Elite utilities would just be added into the pool that all other Legendary stances could then draw from, like how Racial Utilities are accessible across all non-Revenant classes of a given race.
---
So to explain my wrongful understanding, if a Revenant went Glint, I believed they could call on Facet of Light or something while in Legendary Centaur Stance. I didn't think the utilities were locked to Legendary Dragon Stance. I had leveled a Ranger to 80 and unlocked a bit of Druid and a bit of Soulbeast, and while I had to have the respective trait line equipped, I was "allowed" to mix in the Druid's utilities along with base Ranger, or Soulbeast along with base Ranger. So when I leveled through a Revenant and started into Herald only to find, nope, still bound to Assassin's utilities, only...it was disappointing to say the least
---
If you have completed heart of thorns, you can do the collection for caladbolg. Very easy ascended weapon.
---
I always recommend temple armor in the cursed shore area if you have karma to spare.
---
lmao exactly what I said when I read the title.
---
This shit again...
---
I think all of us can currently relate to Pink Blob :|
---
Reaper is incredibly op for solo play and open world content.  It's super tanky, has great burst damage, and gets minions to draw agro.  It can easily solo stuff that you aren't meant to solo.
---
Reaper is a good DPS for fractals, even Tier 4 fractals. It doesn't provide much party support, but it's a solid DPS choice.  When I have to PUG fractals, I sometimes do it on my Reaper and I've never gotten crap for it.
---
It struggles in raids. It's certainly viable for some bosses, but it's not meta on any boss. 
---
Bethesda-level quality control and assurance.

---
I'm sincerely hoping they figure out what went wrong in last year's shitstorm edition and make it an actually fully wholesome campaign this time round. 
---
Even if mediocre, it'd be better than highly controversial.
---
m8, don't get that old wank back just so you can jerk yourself off to your "superior intellect an morality"
---
you think they're unreasonable assholes, they think you're a white knight wanker, there was a bit "fighting" between the groups, end of story.
---
btw i just remodeled my renegade after obtaining the diviner gears. weapons and back are berserker's and the rest armor and trinkets are diviners. I can do auto-attack on golem with shiro's impossible odds on and sit back to see 20k dps. normal attacks only. 
---
He's now looked like a dual katanas samurai lol and i love using him so much
---
For many bags, what comes out depends on level of char that opens them. And when you salvage, items that fit level 49 yield tier 4 materials, platinum, iron, linen, rugged leather, and whatever wood - most expensive stuff you could salvage
---
omg.. this is AWESOME!!! 
---
for me I loved these characters in season 1, but since then thier roles have been very minor so it's not that I fell out of love with them, they're just not used enough for me to notice them anymore. In living story 3 I was happy to see them both return just for Jory to disappear with Lazarus/Balth shortly after returning, Kasmeer was much more of a greater character with the Gods arch of the story in PoF, and fooling the generals too, but still lacked her counterpart alongside her. 
---
What we need is another mystery, they would have been great investigating Rata Primus, or Jory learning from Livia.. 
---
To me, the main problem is that the encumbered box does not stay in the foreground.
---
You have to consider whole system perspective rather than picking on a single process loop. 
---
The market is so flooded with self- taught coders that is difficult for experienced analysts to be heard. 
---
That's ... Questionable, but makes some sense.
---
Thing is, it just ended up being a chaotic mess overall, what with the "friendzone my money boi" thing, which wasn't too good for them. Hopefully this year is better \o/
---
Lengthy timespan between story steps doesn't really make sense, especially in a lot of cases. Though you can't really argue against that in the case of HoT or PoF, in the case of the PS and LW episodes, days at most I'd imagine, that a chapter/episode would take 1-3 weeks in total.
---
I think the charr PS is most evident that events do happen in the gaps. You leave chapter 2 a legionnaire, and you enter chapter 3 a centurion. There was no promotion in the story, you're just suddenly now a higher rank. So inbetween those two chapters there's an implied event that either was, or led to and included, your promotion.
---
Another example would be the dungeon stories. It's canon that the Commander does those events, but they're not part of the story. It wouldn't make sense for the Commander to be helping Tonn blow up a risen tower, talk about the next objective, and then "gotta go to Fireheart Rise and meet up with Logan and Rytlock, kthxbye".
---
&gt; Because we can just as easily assume we were exploring maps and fighting World Bosses during those time gaps, since that is literally what we do, then attending meetings that were never mentioned.
---
Who said it happened in a meeting? Not Bobby Stein. It could have been idle chatter on the way to the next mission in the story, or while exploring maps and fighting world bosses.
---
Point being: Yes, it is jarring. But no, it's not unfounded and unexpected. They should have included it, but the presumption that nothing happens between story gaps is itself unfounded and unexpected.
---
&gt; Still doesn't explain how the game pops up so suddenly.
---
And no one, not even ArenaNet, doesn't say that the sudden pop up of the name (not game) wasn't jarring and ill written.
---
&gt; Going from "that might have been a new dragon" to "it must be Mordremoth" the very next story step, even if it spans a week, feels very out of place, especially for how poor the build up was.
---
I disagree. Especially since it's "that must have been a dragon" to "it must be Mordremoth, as it's the only dragon that deals in plants". It's a logical deduction, really. The only jarring bit was that the name came out of nowhere, presuming the players to know it because it's logical the character would.
---
This is a prime example of exposition failure and nothing else. The characters **WILL** know more about the world than the players, and that knowledge **WILL** come from events not shown on-screen. This is a mandatory, as the characters lived in the world 15+ years (depending on how old you claim your character to be); or in the case of sylvari, experienced the Dream of Dreams to learn an unstated number of things before awakening. The player never sees either of these, and wouldn't really be able to determine how much a charr PC would really know about the world. They can roleplay what they know, but there's roleplaying, and then there's the main plot.
---
I quit WoW for guild wars too and it's so much better, there is always something to do PvE wise, and the PvP and versatility and builds of each class are so fun to explore and every game and fight seems different compared to wow which has so many broken defensive cooldowns and every 2v2 and 3v3 are so slow and predictable.
---
YES. I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT THAT IS THERE. 
---
ENABLE DEPOSIT MATERIALS.
---
ENABLE SALVAGE.
---
STOP DOING THAT.
---
YES, I AM SCREAMING BECAUSE I HAVE TO CLOSE THE WINDOW MID OPENING BAGS OR SALVAGING SO I WOULD AVOID THIS, IT'S STUPID.
---
SBI only has one big EST guild.  Also in general the server isn't really about massive zerg fights. 
---
Ha! I still have my Wii!
---
Firebrand. Very versatile... dps, quickbrand, healbrand... all in one profession.
---
Its like old druid.
---
New druid, very boring.
---
Characters of levels ~49-53 get Tier 4 mats from salvaging the gear from Bags of Gear. This is the most profitable tier of materials on the TP, unlike opening them on a level 80 char and getting Tier 6 mats
---

---
Reaper is my main now, after playing ele since launch. It just mows down everything in PoF/story without an issue, where I'd be actually having to work to keep my ele alive. 
---
I really enjoy it for PvE, but I still roll ele/guard in group content. 
---
Thanks guild leader, I appreciate it!
---
Completely disagree. Energy isn't perfect but it does add to versatility somewhat (e.g. I can cast multiple elites very close together, can't just skillspam like you do on thief).
---
One of the good things about fewer weapons is fewer redundancies- do you really use different weapons that often (apart from weaponswap)? Each rev weapon has a dedicated purpose (mainhand or offhand power, condi, etc).
---
Tbh I don't like your suggestions for a redesign. Might as well just rename the class "heavy armour ele" and kill all it's personality

Well, getting render state for 3-4 states will not that impactfull, so i'll add GetRS impl for things you use. But anyway if you use fixed pipeline or Draw*UP, it will not work at the end.

---
How much diviners and berserkers are needed? What's the easiest way (don't want to farm thunderhead keep metas if possible) plz 😀?
---
I'd disagree about the Dungeons. They ARE part of the story, just not required. But events in the story directly lead into the dungeons and you do get mail about the dungeons, both for hitting the level and as part of the story. That said, since they rebalanced the story the levels are a bit out of wack so it doesn't line up as well as it used to, but the breaks are there.
---
Anyway, for the rest of it I more or less agree. But if are character did know about the sixth dragon, it should have been in story and not off-screen. It is like saying the Pact knew Zhitan's weakness and were intentionally exploiting it, but it just never came up in dialog; that would be a very important plot point that would become relevant later so just to assume everyone knows is bad design. And there are cases where we know more than the character so it kinda feels like they just assumed the character knew what the players know, which isn't always true.
---
And I still don't buy the whole "could have been told" as "obvious we were told" since there is nothing to suggest it one way or the other and I doubt a new player will just go "oh, they told me off screen" when hit with an out of nowhere reveal like that. Part of my point is that it was very obvious at the time since we had months to speculate but if you just go Personal Story to S1 Recap to S2 you aren't as likely to connect the dots since you don't dwell on them as long. Though you're also likely to be spoiled to a large part of the story since spoilers are advertised to you but that is another and trickier problem.
---
Neither.

I will definitely do the whole next week! ^^ Epharisto Parapoli!

---
I'm guessing you weren't around for the controversy.  Other posts in this thread explain what happened to an extent, but to sum it up:  Anet recruited a Twitch streamer who doesn't play the game, story was heartwarming but players found out the guy gave money to the girl, and that's how they became friends.  Then players looked up the streamer's channel, and things started looking sketchy.   THEN toxic players flooded the streamer's chat.
---
The marketing campaign ended up with a negative outlook.  It made it seem Anet fabricated stories because a non-player was featured.  I believe the girl explained that it wasn't her idea to be a part of the Friend/ship campaign, since Anet approached her and asked to participate.   Now I know some people say any publicity is good publicity, but not on this case.
---
Holy crap, what??
---
Man, TIL. Seriously, I've been wasting magic find items apparently

God that nostalgia throwback. Back when dungeons were end game.

I don't understand how the prisoner is shackled? When I tried deimos, he gets freed after the prephase where you kill the 4 chains.

The promotion is about friendships in GW2 and "the girl" (her name is Bria btw) met her friend in the video playing GW2. They've been friends for years and if you looked at her response about him (supporting each other through multiple highs in lows in life over a period of years - something many people would be lucky to have from any friend) it's actually a really sweet story of friendship - and it began in GW2.
---
The only thing that went "wrong" last year was the community's misguided and bad faith reaction to the video, all rooted in some kind of ugly and hurtful conspiracy and bad faith judgements.
---
A promotion about GW2 friendships featuring a healthy and supportive friendship that has lasted several years and helped both people deal with highs and lows in their real lives - that seems like a success to me. Unfortunately for ArenaNet, this sub's response showed how ugly the GW2 community can be.
---
Vallun (the streamer) has a good guide on getting greens on YouTube. Google it 😀
---
Chrono and Firebrand both bring quickness, Druid does not.
---
Didn't this go horrible last game and feature a lot of cringey stuff?
---
If they met playing the game in 2012 and remain good friends to this day, isn't that still a successful promotion and something worth pointing out to the world? Look - our game is so great that people who play it get more than just two blues and a green from a chest, they get lifelong friends! This is an MMO, not a single player game - the product is the community in addition to the content.
---
It's similar to Coke - they don't just sell the product, they sell the fantasy of being young and beautiful with your friends at the beach having fun. Guild Wars 2 is trying to promote and sell the game leveraging the real relationships of fans who met or played the game together. Does it matter if they log in for raids or fractals every week, as long as they met GW2 or it facilitated an important friendship at an important time in their life?
---
Got it. Thank you so much for helping! You're great!
---
Can someone tell me the order of gear from best to worst? I see a lot of talk about rares, ascended, exotic, and legendary but I'm confused about which is better. 
---
Chrono offers quickness and alacrity among other utility things.
---
Druid provides might, fury and healing among other things.
---
Firebrand provides quickness, might and healing among other things.
---
Chrono has strong synergy with druid because they offer different things. Firebrand has strong synergy with renegade for similar reasons. Other combinations arent very good since some things are overlapping, making it a somewhat bad pick.
---
Generally it's a lot better to run these supports as duos, but you can also take them as solo supports, in which case druid is probably the worst of 4.
---
Reading all this comments I'm not that confident anymore to put my two cents into anets hashtag stuff. I met my finance in GW2, a lot of people that I already met in RL knowing from the game, I was a maid of honor of two loving people who also met in GW2. There are so many good memories I have with this game, it makes me a bit sad how their marketing stuff f*cked up ._.
---
Just looking at this inventory picture makes me want to play GW2 again
---
I recommend against Kaineng. We've lost a good chunk of our population and aren't very active outside of NA prime anymore.  
---
We have a couple SEA and EU guilds that are fairly consistent but are usually faced with one of two extremes; heavily outnumbered and unable to do anything or nothing to fight and PPTing with a map Q.  
---
NA prime is very strong and after being with Kain for the last 5 (?) months I can say that we have the competence to give pretty much anyone a run for their money. But, again thanks to losing some of our population and having extremely spotty coverage, you're probably better off with either SBI or another server all together. 
---
Legendary (purple) = Ascended (pink) &gt; Exotic (orange) &gt; Rare (yellow) &gt; Masterwork (green) &gt; Uncommon (blue) &gt; Common (white) 
---
We have Gaile but she's more of a relic from the past. She used to be great but not anymore. 
---
Also, the partnership program is full of people that stopped playing gw2 long ago and apparently it takes forever to partner new people that actually upload content qnd stream gw2.
---
Thanks for the link.  In Bria's first bullet point, she confirms Anet reached out to her.  I was hoping I wouldn't have to dig Reddit for a source.
---
You can also damage it slowly and mitigate healing by avoiding its leeching attacks. But yes, it's meant to be a tutorial fight to familiarise you with that exact mechanic so you can execute it later so naturally it forces you to rely on it. Could have been implemented better, but it is what it is.
---
Unless you have dozens of TP to friends laying around, the scroll is probably cheaper and can be combined with the other maps' scrolls to take up only one shared inventory slot.
---
Gee maybe because they don't want to? Lol
---
Ascended/Legendary* are the same effective strength (only difference is that Legendary can freely swap stats, runes/sigils, and infusions whenever the user wants as long as they're out of combat). The tier right under that is Exotic (how big of a difference depends on your build). Under that is Rare, then Masterwork, then Fine, then Basic.
---
*The only other thing about Legendary is that it'll be at the currenty highest tier of strength in the game, assuming that ANet adds a tier above Legendary (which is unlikely given all the current investment into Ascended stuff) then Legendary stuff will have their stats scaled to that new higher tier.
---
To be fair, it makes sense lore-wise and mechanic-wise. 
---
Revenant's thing is that you only have the abilities of your current channeled Legend. Now, I'm not saying it should be that way, but it is what it is. 
---
In terms of game flavor, it's also correct because as of now, you can only channel one Legend at a time. Why should you be able to call on Ventari's abilities when you're channeling Kalla at the time? You could argue you've picked both of them, but in-game we don't see anyone channeling two at the same time. 
---
That's what we call blobbing.  Nothing necessarily "wrong" with it.  Just doesn't require much skill to win fights with a blob.  Individual impact is lower, and it is harder for opponents to muster a big enough force to stop a blob.  
---
probably bro, and yeah nowadays as long as u get 2 supports and the rest can be any dps. but well, FB mix with chrono or ren kinda = to druid mix with chrono and ren lol
---
only fb mix with druid ........ fucking hard to group kill but lacked a bit on dps since supportbrand has low to no dps, and druid does low dps as well lol
---
Ok thanks for the heads up
---
Lol ty it’s crazy that all these comments unrelated to the post are getting down votes
---
&gt;what value is added from having a killable NPC? 
---
I think it's for PvP purposes. Even if nobody *uses* them in PvP, I believe that's what it's for.
---
I'd agree. I'm no expert at the game, but rather than worrying about a 'meta' I think you are better off just playing a class you enjoy, and in my experience with MMOs that often comes down to the class' theming. 
---
...Renegade can be both? Alacrity (or healing) Renegade existing doesn't mean Condition Renegade stops existing. 
---
I'm new to the game and started out as a thief, but damn if PvP wasn't tough so I rolled a ranger and that feels much easier. Did you get good at thief? Any tips? 
---
it's the internet, so there's probably a few. 
---
GW2 is an MMO and the big four MMOs are WoW, FF14, GW2, and ESO. WoW and FF14 are the older tab-targetting style, whereas ESO has action combat like GW2. Be warned though that it's nowhere near as smooth as GW2's and I personally hate it. The classes also don't feel anywhere near as distinct. Either way, whenever someone is looking for an MMO to play, those are the four to try out first.
---
Thief is considered more as an advanced class because, to play it effectively, you have to be map-aware. Your primary role is to cap/decap points because of how fast you can move around and disengage, with your secondary being to +1 fights and end them quickly with your burst.
---
IMO you can be terrible at fighting as a thief and still be a great asset to your team all the way up to play just by focusing on capping points and never dying. 
---
I got HoT from CDKeys for around $13. 
---
no
---
They are pretty good at PVE, but you usually use them to decap and plus one. For pve, not really sure, since I just run whatever. 
---
To be a good thief make one of every class and play 100 games with each. Then learn how to play conquest. Then learn how to play thief. Then learn all the maps. Then learn how to carry games like the 4 other teammates are monkeys. 
---
&gt; Aside from the fact that this was literally what ArenaNet writers tell us is the case.
---
I meant nothing to suggest it ingame. You can't expect someone doing a story playthrough now to know a Writer said this on a forum. And I can agree S1 not being playable or the recap not covering enough is part of it, but I did watch the 3 hour recap and the transition to S2 Ep1 and S2 Ep 2 still felt off.
---
I'd say my big issues are that the story, not bonus dialog, doesn't hint enough about more Elder Dragons and the name Mordremoth isn't dropped beforehand. I did listen to the scrapped S1 ending and that dialog did such a better job than what we got. But S2E1 opens with "you've heard the theories that Scarlet disturbed one of the dragons" and it never mentions the roar or a sixth dragon, so it suggest the characters are unaware of that or it should have came up in dialog. But then we open S2E2 with our character saying "We've got a new dragon to contend with" and mentioning Mordremoth.
---
And I get that everyone agrees S2E2 handles the revelation there poorly, but I don't think the things you're bringing up to justify this stuff do justify it, It is like the retcon that we did exploit Zhaitan's weakness; it is a reason to explain things but it doesn't make it a good reason. Also, I still don't get why they went with his weakness being killing his Eyes and Mouths and not cleansing his domain...
---
You guys are acting like Anet shooting themselves in the foot an repeating mistakes is a new thing 
---
My friend said as much (that it's one of the more advanced classes to play) and I get what I have to do in principle. Use shadowstep and all my mobility abilities to jump in, burst damage folks, and then jump out. I'm just having trouble coordinating it all and being quick enough. I also feel really squishy and people just crush me.
---
To add to the other answers, it really depends on what type of ranged weapon you're using. Fundamentally you're only good for ranged weapons within the mid-ranged category (900 units or so) which usually consists of stuff like Scepter, Shortbows, and Ranger/Necro axe (being that they're ranged and not melee weapons on those classes).
---
On the other side of the spectrum you have certain classes with a viable close range while using specific ranged weapons, these include Rifle Deadeye (strong single target burst without range-based damage decay), staff Elementalist (all specs, strong AoE damage also without range-based damage decay), and Condi Berserker (no range-based damage decay, longbow for them is a 1,200 unit shortbow in terms of playstyle). Range-based damage decay is something like Ranger's longbow or Mesmer's greatsword's auto attacks, where they lose damage the closer you are to the enemy.
---
So basically give up on thief in PVP until I'm better at the game? xD
---
I'm also experiencing this problem in personal story. 
---
It was to the guy saying there should be an auto deposit materials comment. I see how terrible my reply not addressed to him looks now :(

was just wondering what it is about the 3 files in the bin folder d3d9.exp d3d9.lib and d3d9.pdb  
---
as it looks like it is working without these 3 only with the d3d9.dll
---
Nice, grabbing a shot of me telling everyone I'm cheap. 10/10

His arm is working fine. He's just related to Jonathan Joestar.

So squishy
---
Not really. Honestly it doesn’t matter what class you play when your first starting out. Your main goal in spvp should be learning what every class is capable of, the only way to really do that is to play them yourself. 
---
Pvp isn’t going to be good if you don’t know why your dying. A good part of early learning I learning what is and isn’t pointless suicide. 
---
Not OP, but actually just started the game myself as a thief, and boy am I finding it tough. I feel *so* damn squishy in both PvE and PvP. I'm not having this problem with my ranger, which my friend recommended creating as one of the 'easier' classes to learn. But still, I really want to play my thief! Any tips?
---
Ok, let me put it like this, more people will complain about the current system, than my proposed alternative. 
---
As for an intuitive user experience, to be honest, who cares?  I don't mean that as in, 'just get good, fuck the noobs' kinda way.  What I mean is, in the course of a lifetime, a gw2 player opens thousands upon thousands of bags.  Learning one, non intuitive rule early on isn't that bad, and really shouldn't be used as justification to keep an annoying system in place.  Part of playing a game is learning the rules.  If your really concerned about it, you could make this a toggle feature, similar to instant cast aoe's vs double cast, keeping the current style as the default setting.

It's random, but you can usually see the barricades at the end of some roads.

Revenant has the best (competitive) meme builds though. You can make most legend combinations work, they just won't be meta and you'll have to put in more effort depending on your desired build purpose.
---
In general;
---
* Additional utilities would be nice for variety. Could also solve the lack of synergy some people experience.(Also racials when?)
---
* Additional core weapons would be nice. (ranged+condition is something i'm personally missing.)
---
* For core; i'd like Jalis to be a bit more useful in small scale/solo combat. Also the Salvation trait line needs some love. Retribution is great since it got updated.
---
* Renegade really needs some love in competitive... every aspect of the spec. Kalla skills shouldn't have killable npcs. Give **Ice**razor some actual ice.(chill) Shortbow needs some love as well. Skill #2 is a great concept but doesn't function properly. (It often misses 1-2/3 projectiles on moving targets.) Skill #3 needs to be replaced with something that can either land more reliably or offer some form of evade/movement. Skill #4 needs to be able to be cast behind the player, why else do i shoot arrows into a portal?
---
To me, the traitline is the strongest aspect of Renegade in competitive modes.
---
Imagine how sad it is for Renegades when core legends/weapons seem better (generally) in competitive than Kalla/Shortbow.
---
I think there is a cave near the waypoint i could be wrong though
---
No
---
What's a class that you can count on to whoop ass any time and have a lot of fun?
---
No, it's probably connected to the Tengu hero point north of there. Just follow the map corner north to the other side of the water and you should get to a bridge high above the water where the Tengu is standing at the end.
---
Holosmith (elite spec for Engineer) is amazingly fun. Unfortunately, leveling as an Engineer is not.
---
Power D/D Ele is pretty fun imo
---
I see what you did there.
---
Daredevil and deadeye are one of the best single target dps classes. Great for fractals and raids 
---
Definitely this.
---
Thanks to this feature, I've changed from left-clicking several times in frustration to right-clicking then panicking hysterical the next second because I salvaged a stack of Unid gear.
---
That's what you get for trusting Charr technology.
---
Thanks for the reply guys. Could Any of you send me specs for pvp/pve dps? I'd appreciate it a lot. I wanna try everythjng out that people commented on. 
---
I usually use my own birthday, as it’s easy to remember.
---
On GTA V RP servers I use my own and my brothers and sisters birthday for same reason easy to remained ^^
---
It was not in the rules when they released that showcase, wouldn't be the first time they edit stuff later though no way to prove it so if it is then fine.
---
Yea and to you and that person, could you find one good reason why Anet would go out of their way to make a video about 2 ppl that couldn't care less about gw2 since before HoT released when there are so many others with similar stories that still actually play the game? I cannot think of any.
---
Saying "hey here are 2 ppl that met in our game then quit, one is streamer btw but you wont find a single guild wars stream there for year+ and afterwards too." is not good marketing. Cannot believe people can even argue against that.

the bard is like RNG being passive agressive, not even worth the pre drop xD
