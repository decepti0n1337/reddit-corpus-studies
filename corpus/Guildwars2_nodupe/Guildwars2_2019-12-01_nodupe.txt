Newbie here, when should I start inscription my gear? I'm a Level 15 Mesmer and I feel like I'm churning my equipment pretty quickly, so I've been saving my inscriptions in my bank.

---
No matter how much you trust them, if they aren't in anet page of official resellers, you are risking getting banned.
---
I heard that its a SP type of MMO that got me curious, also we dont have that many new games in this fantasy style, something that remind me of Dragon Age
---
Best part is the Pale tree was about to make some big public announcement at the world summit right before the shadow attacked, so she was probably about to spill the beans on her people's origin before it reached critical threat.

---
The entire Sylvari conspiracy was a clusterfuck of well intentioned cowardice.

¨player limit and shadows mostly XD
---
Well, sort of. In-game money, the stuff you earn and use in-game, is called gold. There's also a premium currency called gems, which you buy using real money. You can exchange gold for gems and vice versa, but only with other players (so there's an exchange rate that will vary with the game economy). Living world seasons can only be bought with gems, so if you want to use in-game money, you'll have to exchange your gold for gems. This might be doable for an endgame player, but as a new player, you'll likely be wanting to spend your gold on outfitting your characters, and will really struggle to afford all the living world episodes. 
---
So in all honesty, you'll probably need to buy them with real money. On the bright side, they're free if you log in while the latest episode is active, so you'll never need to buy future episodes.
---
Yea - 110% this - if anything happens to your game and it was bought by third party, you can only get help from the third party, not Anet. Buy direct from Anet.
---
Thank you!
---
Raiders, yes, not "hardcore players." The hardcore players are farming Bjora Marches right now. People left, people showed up, the overall population is roughly the same.
---
sure, buddy whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
you can be in an alliance, with guilds that are more raid oriented ect. so rather than having one person spreading themselves thin in 5 guilds, you have 5 guilds that are then the player who can have their choice of content without sacrificing as much communication and community.
---
No it isn't. Not in the least.
---
I don't have choice over who's in the alliance, if their raid schedule doesn't work for me I'm screwed.
---
Give me your money please
---
Unfortunately, there is no true Beast master build  in GW2, as builds never get that specific/specialised. However, there are builds where enhancing your pet is a decent part of the playstyle.
---
For PvP, Core ranger with Marksmanship, Wilderness Survival and Beastmastery does rely on its pet for a lot of burst damage, CC, and utility.
---
It may not be a random site, but the facts are that these grey market sites are not affiliated with the place that are selling the keys and time and time again we hear stories that people buy keys from them and are banned shortly after. Yes, some keys will be legit, but is it worth the risk for a few bucks? 
---
And yes, you could say I lurk here, I'm a mod for this sub and have seen it all :) I'm not just talking out my ass here. Save yourself the heartache and grab PoF from DLgamer. 
---
As for the Skyrim MMO, do you mean Elder Scrolls Online? I've played it for a little under a year, it's got a lot going for it. It's updated regularly, has festivals, the optional sub is worth it. It does a lot of things I don't like such as no centralised trading post, no LFG for non-dungeon/pvp activities, faction restrictions are annoying for pvp, jumping is clunky as hell. But it did give me a fair bit of entertainment for 9 months or so. Granted, my interest has lessened a lot recently. The ESO subreddit would give you more info about the state of the game, they seem happy over there :)
---
Not really, most negative feedback gets silenced by other players, or just blatantly ignored by the devs. If this weren't true, the game would be in a much better state these days.
---
Some good advice for any new player is to read the metabattle guide on your build and then watch streams/videos of other people playing your class. Watching how good players rotate between nodes and which skills they prioritize can be extremely useful. That and just keep practicing between matches in the pvp lobby, first on the golems/ai and then in the pit to train your 1v1 skills as 1v1ing is very important on warrior. 
---
Here are some good links also:

---
Keep in mind though you don't need to run meta builds to win in Silver/Gold and you might be better off running slightly more defensive versions of them while you're still in silver and might be having trouble surviving but in the long run, I would recommend aiming for the meta.

in general don't bother until lvl 80, but if you've got a little bit of silver floating around, it doesn't hurt to throw minor/major sigils of fire and air into your weapons. they're only a couple silver apiece so you're not throwing away much when you swap in new weapons, and they do a dramatic amount of bonus damage at lower levels.
---
Awesome job again folks, keep up to great work!

what are the 15 new account stats being tracked?

To be fair, the first guy was talking about getting the CM title, so perhaps for experienced players but not hardcore groups.

Hey Vampires didn't sparkle in Buffy.
---
There's no "far behind and late to the crowd" in any game you listed and most of current MMOs (debatable for BDO, but heavily depends on your goals). You can pick up any and catch up to majority of people even without without rushing anything. If you feel game isn't fun anymore and doesn't look like you'll have fun, no reason to keep playing it, keep good memories and move on, just try something, maybe you'll like it. I initially got hooked away from gw2 by Dark Souls games and more I played them less I wanted to go back and generally understood how much I missed normal single and multiplayer games (though DS is a mix of both).
---
Absolutely you should play gw2 if the content looks like something you'd like! It has a very active, very positive in-game community, many great guilds, lots of great content, and is still in active development.
---
Yeah I forgot Deroir was a developer at Anet who knows everything. I love how one community member like Deroir say something like this people grasp on as if its written in the bible but last week Tom Abernathy the studio narrative director spent hours on his own personal twitter trying to talk and reassure the community the game was continuing but if I remember that reddit thread talking about the tweets was more negative than positive downvote this all you want call me an Anet apologist or a white knight. I will agree 2019 has been a horrible year people needlessly lost their jobs but until a senior dev like Tom, Z, or one of the of top people at Anet comes out and says this the game continues I have this radical thought of the devs know more than some guy on twitch. That goes for all of them.
---
Oh my lawd, y'all some beautiful people
---
Nice creativity.
---
I loved this achievement. Back when I started it, I was takinh pretty frequent breaks from the game, (I still do since I can never manage to stay focused on one game for too long), but it was always super fun to log in after a while and see that this achievement has progressed. 
---
I've never had a huge issue with timegating but I can understand the frustration that comes with it, but I think this achieve is perfectly fine, just a small bit of flavor added to the game, with no significant mastery/upgrade locked behind it.
---
They do. If mora gets stuck the other event dosnt show up ever...
---
Not the first time someone made sure their degenerate guild message is visible.
---
Was at around 1k and there still wasn't a limit if you're curious.
---
&amp;#8238;You have it backwards, son.
---
to play devil's advocate here, I think the main reasons why they do not respond to these topics is either because they *"can't"* due to them being limited in what they can and can't say due to NCSoft or the Higher ups in general, or because they know that responding to these topics might just add fuel to the fire since the response might not be what we want to hear.
---
Not justifying their silence tho, I agree that it would be nice if they could at least respond once in a blue moon to these *"controversial"* topics, but at the same time... we don't have the bigger picture, most of their *"reasons"* are behind closed door and probably under some kind of NDA... that's just how companies work.
---
There are options in the F11 menu to make your ground targets lock to the targeted enemy. And on the other end of the spectrum: using action camera makes it easy to play the game without ever tab targeting. You just fire your projectiles in the rough direction of the enemy.
---
I think there are a number of options like these that you’ve missed, and you may enjoy looking into them to better customize your gameplay.
---
It's pretty easy to use springer to skip the hard parts.
---
The answers in order;
---
1. Only you will know and you'll only know after a download.
---
2. It's not dead. Competitive mode pissbabies have been on a rampage since they realized their favorite game modes are always going to be a low priority for development. Ignore them. 
---
3. Unfortunately only the core game is free to play. Some of the Living World maps can be played without the expansions or episodes but they're exceptions.
---
looking at their post history, I'm assuming Warframe.
---
Nah, gotta maintain the consistent inconsistency

Thanks for the reminder, forgot to start this on the other account.

I certainly don't remember the statue, but I do remember the budget Ascended weapon you can get per character. Quest is Knight of the Thorn.

---
Thank you, your site is one of the best resources for the game. Glad to be a supporter.
---
I started playing gw2 three days ago for the first time ever and your site has been the most valuable resource i could have imagined! Thank you so much for your work :)
---
Quite cheap to get a set from the trading post, or from Orr through karma. I think it’s also the most fun to comb through the achievement panel and see those which reward ascended and exotic pieces. That takes more time obviously but can make the process interesting.
---
Because there are massively more armor/weapons, of multiple weight classes. Feels like it would be a mess without the additional filters, which seems obviously why they did it the way it is.
---
Glad to hear that!
---
make it or buy it
---
You are welcome :)
---
I would work your way over to the Silver Wastes.  Running around for a few cycles will should net you enough stuff (vendor, sell on TP, etc) to buy a full set of exotics.  Just by a set of Berserker's gear to start.  There is *a lot* to do (and unlock) before you should worry about specialized armor types (vipers, minstrel's, etc) or ascended armor.  Also, if you really want to play a particular gear/talent spec, don't discount rare gear.  It's a cheap way to try to see if you want to play in a particular spec before investing.
---
For fun it could have been restricted to EU...
---
You can get a lot of gear for cheap that has the same stats as what you're looking for. Look for the stat combos and not the stat combo name with the TP dropdown menu. 
---
ie: *Devona's Chest Guard* has berserker stats but is much cheaper (1g 50s) than the gear with the name "berserker" in the name like *Berserker's Exalted Coat* (8g 60s).
---
But if the problem is just lacking gold? Do your three dailies. Sell off the entirety your materials vault (assuming you're not into crafting) on the TP. Sell any mystic coins you also have (assuming you're not into crafting and can get login rewards). And do the other gold earning activities there are a thousand guides online for. You'll have the coin soon enough.
---
But Helga Bot is adorable. She is even able to kill the lord!
---
My experience with duos is quite the opposite of yours. I've duo'ed with players far below my skill level and we both come out on top. I've also duo'ed with players at my skill level and we both came out on top.
---
Did I say exclusively support? No. I said a build/spec known to carry others. While duel specs/spike specs can carry a team, that is only if their team is competent. Builds that can carry other allies (like support Firebrand, prot holo, etc) can make a bad team decent.
---
Honestly don't even waste the time and effort for exotic gear. Pony up and spend the 300-350 gold for the ascended armour and weapons
---
I [run this version in fractals](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Scrapper_-_Healing_Scrapper) all the time. It works really well in fractals, particularly condi heavy ones such as siren's reef, or when the afflicted instability is up. It also works really well at damage mitigation with protection and bulwark gyro. My boon output is partially dependent on what the enemy is doing -- the more condis the enemy provides, the better my boon output.
---
I definitely outheal most druids in fractals, prevent most wipes with damage reduction, and keep condis well under control. I've hard-carried groups that otherwise wouldn't have had a chance.
---
For some reason the snowcrows version doesn't run Purity of Purpose, which is really weird to me, but I guess it's for raids where there is some dedicated person providing boons.
---
Welcome to 2013, we had dreams back then
---
Just most of them. The rest aren't really relevant.
---
Looks like gathering bug to me but I can't see well on phone
---
I updated the site design a little bit to make sure it can handle the amount of items this year and make it mobile friendly :)
---
Well it's looking good :)
---
I'd also add that for MMORPGs the streams are varied and not that focused on PvP. In fact the dominating names in the MMO genre are PvE centric (WoW/FFXIV).
---
The fact is that if players want to play PvP, they go with a PvP game in the first place and that market is already saturated and highly competitive.
---
IMO, a MMORPG should focus on what players want from MMORPGs: a rich and persistant world with community interraction.
---
So I just finished the first map with my first Character (Queensdale) I know that now I need to go ti the next map but how do I now which one and how to get it?
---
Got any idea for stat selectable weapons? Thanks in advance!
---
Hoping there is some way to easily obtain Minstrel/Viper weapon. Those are the though ones.
---
If you've been doing your daily every day, you can probably buy a set of exotic of your choice off the trading post right now. There are other ways to go, but that's easy enough.
---
Cheapest would be WvW reward track with the hero weapon track. 
---
For crafting there is Tenebrous/Shimmering but that requires a HoT guild hall, rng for the crystal to drop while mining from the gh ore synthesizer and 10 guild commendations per weapon
---
You can send prizes to "Queicherius" or "Saskia Van Leeuwen", if you would like to donate for some more lotteries in the new year :)
---
I have considered that feature, but it's on the back-burner for now. I have a ton of stuff I want to get done before that.
---
Don’t see it mentioned yet. It’s the item on your buff bar to indicate that you have Soldier’s Focus ready
---
Fortnite save the world was on the verge of bankruptcy before they released a multiplayer, pvp mode. Riot games was unknown before doing the same. If you still think pve is the backbone of games, that is really wrong based on statistics everywhere.
---
Surprise! Welcome to GW2, the game that *is* Single player friendly! I hope you enjoy it.
---
Nonsense. Don't be salty just because they're culling off the unplayed modes.
---
Tactics trait line also gives some aura effect.
---
&gt; any MMORPG that tried server vs. server ended up neglecting that game mode in short 
---
You do realize that Anet dropped support for WvW before they dropped out of PvP support, right? I am not sure how you call that "THE success story of server vs server". 
---
The fact that it was a 3 team versus was a failure from launch to current time along with other base problems the game mode had.
---
If you press M to open the world map, and zoom out a bit, you'll see the level ranges of other maps displayed.  In your case, there are two other maps adjacent to Queensdale, Kessex Hills to the south (15-25) and Gendarran Fields to the east (25-35).  Kessex would obviously be your choice to go to.
---
It's not your only choice, though.  One other thing the game does is unlock a waypoint in each newbie zone right from the start, so people can play together with friends without having to be the same race.  As such, you can go further south to Metrica Province or Caledon Forest, or further east to Wayfarer Foothills or Plains of Ashford, if you'd rather.  Those are the other four 1-15 zones.  If you map things out quickly and don't participate in many events, it's possible that you won't level fast enough to keep up with the normal zone progression, in which case ducking out into another race's newbie zone can help you catch up.  You still earn good XP and proper loot by fighting lower level opponents and mapping lower level areas, because of the game's downscaling feature that keeps you from overpowering those enemies.
---
And legend of zelda isn't as popular and players don't spend as much time and money on it. I don't think you understand how numbers work.
---
Elementalist can solo.  However, it is definitely more fragile than Warrior, so it's a class with a higher skill floor.  You need to know your weapon abilities and how to dodge on an Elementalist to be successful.
---
All classes can solo, but if you want classes that have low skill floors/are easy to play, Warrior, Necromancer and Ranger are probably the three that fit that mold most.
---
&gt;And legend of zelda isn't as popular
---
Oooooooh kay. . .
---
Every class can handle itself - it just depends on the build. For ele try [fresh air auramancer](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Fresh_Air_Auramancer).  
---
But generally necro is considered the most solo friendly class.  
---
It also depends much on your playstyle. I for example have a hard time surviving on necro, but I do just fine surviving on ele. You need to experiment and see what works for you.
---
Thank you for the kind words :)
---
Oh so thats why. I wish theres a way to turn it off. Kinda ruin my warrior fashion.
---
The best place to ask for raid builds would be the Snow crows help desk on Discord.
---
Tell one of em "learn to tpye"
---
That will be 300 Gems per Character.
---
A counter opinion for non-cm fractals as a qb/hfb player for the current meta:  
---
In fracs phases are really short(should be...) In my experience, if a group is struggling to phase it is usually a problem of failing/not understanding mechanics. Mostly lack of CC - that is the biggest problem in T4. You cannot outheal all platforms dropping in reactor end boss. If your party keeps getting caught at the wind push at sirens reef you need to slot stability, not more healing. Deepstone has mechanics that will basically down you, and a dps check. (Deepstone is the fractal that makes me go 'you dps thing go do your job' the most...)  
---
The only instab that makes hfb harder to play is the social awkwarness, because of its short range. Even that is perfectly manageable in T4.  
---
So you don't really need a lot of healing in fracs, you need more CC probably.(the 'proper' party comp is to run without a healer anyway, just sayin)
---
So the Santa this year is GW2 Efficiency! Woohoo!
---
Ah the real issue are the pve pip farmers who have no other way to create a ascended weapon cheaply than doing PvP.
---
Immagine how sad is for a guy to stay there and wait to be mauled by bots over and over. At the end u Just go afk.
---
I think it is stupid and there are fastest way to do that but for Mr just arrived it is a good way . Do not worry he will do a season before starting doing fractals.
---
Maybe 2
---
I don’t understand why ANet haven’t invited you for partnership yet. gw2efficiency and the wiki are the two GW2 sites I visit daily.
---
You can look up the Dungeon armour vendors to get a set like Berserker, the Karma vendors in Orr at the temples also sell decent sets. Crafting them is also something you can do without much money you have to spend (though you need to be level 400), you can also buy them from the TP.
---
Do you daily. Use tp and get a piece a day. It is less than 2 gold each. In two weeks you are dressed.
---
Do the new map and feed the koda in the forest . Have your cheap ascended amulet.
---
Do afk in PvP for a season ranked ( or play Vs bot if I prefer) enough times to finish till last chest. Bing u got a free ascended item. Start with weapon.
---
If I do not do fractal ignore the rest
---
Something something can't do that because of spaghetti code UI something something
---
TIL Guide Wars is when you just use guides instead of finding stuff on your own.
---
i just see hardcore casual on your title and just read the first paragraph then i stop you are probably ( %100) wrong please keep having fun on your dead game its your masterpiece thanks to casuals :) :) :)
---
"do afk in pvp"  
---
and wait for next ban wave. great advice.
---
it isnt.its full of crawling casuals making rytlock-crecia fetish porn dreams and cosplays,tequatl and other no brain required contents.For your own sanity leave this game to death.Its waste of time
---
Can someone tell me  whats the difference between monthly and lifetime support on gw2efficiency?
---
Sorry, what? Not a fan of Zelda but "Breath of the Wild was a launch game for the Switch and the final game published by Nintendo for the Wii U. ... By 2019, Breath of the Wild had sold over 16.04 million copies worldwide"
---
those are some very generous prices there, tyvm guys for doing this for our awesome community
---
is there a way to make the crafting thing faster ; like don't have to put 1 by 1 item on it cause it seems kinda slow? XD
---
Oh oh oh, what an amazing santa claus you are !
---
If you think a game that makes 12 million a quarter is a dead game, you don't know what a dead game is.  
---
Of course a 7 year old game is most likely going to have less players than it did in the 3rd year. The only question is is there enough of a stable population to keep the game running. So far there is. 
---
With all the doom and gloom and all the nay sayers and all the anti-casual sentiment, you don't realize just how many casuals are out there.
---
Only a tiny percent of people do mythic raids in WoW. Only a tiny percent of people run the hardest content in any game. The age of the average computer gamer is in their mid 30s.  I don't think 50% of them have the time or energy to be hard core anymore. Times have changed Some people just haven't noticed.
---
The game you describe as most popular games are not. They are only the most watchable that have new content/balances frequently.
---
With some just following the gaming trend to benefit from it.
---
The content is what will maintain your game alive for years but not all games are made to.
---
Why theses games focus on pvp? Because it's replayable infinitly unlike story.
---
And a new DLC/Expac cost a lot more than balances, changes, some content you throw times to times.
---
I don't know about all games but a lot of these that i know have introduced a season pass/battle pass. It is the same, you pay to have a season of content/skins. And paying make you come back more often.
---
First they should remove the pointless invisibility many wardrobe skins have. All of them should be available for preview, no exceptions.
---
wow is 15 years old game and making much more than dead wars 2.Mythic raids are the thing that keep wow alive.ok boomer ?
---
Agree, GW2 equipment could be easily reduced to 6 sets, removing all the crap. Then we could move the rune system into traits, and make them affect gameplay for real.
---
None will be banned to be afk in PvP. Ever.
---
Or there will be only bots left.
---
Btw I added or play Vs bot. But when I are in a match with bots who will report you ? The bots ?
---
PvP is dead as content but for getting free ascended for those who are new.
---
But really playing Vs bots is depressing so it would be ok to go afk
---
love your idea. 
---
since necromancer is the main emo class, he often hurts himself in order to hurt the target. maybe that could work here too.
---
also as you were saying about the chain buff, I think that would work better with some sort of stacking - maybe depending on how much life force he uses or such.
---
I also noticed a lot of improvements in terms of performance as well and the site feels much more fluid to use those days. Great job anyway and thanks for your work!
---
Out of curiosity, how many developers are contributing to the project and what's your technical stack?
---
I'm not against the idea but it will make infusions drop in value.
---
This is why you shouldn't kill the viability of the active builds. Having to swap gear and playstyle after every stupid balance patch is one of the reasons why I stopped playing raids. You can't get good at something that is nerfed to the ground every few months.
---
ArenaNet sucks at balancing, and they always follow the "ruin what's good" approach instead of giving better alternatives.
---
In PvE - you won't run into any bots, at most afk farmers.  
---
The LFG (group finder) section for raids has some listing for raid selling guilds, but that's about it.
---
The core game had a lot of problems as well, but at least it looked like it was going into the right direction. As those problems got fixed, new problems came in. One step forward, two steps backwards.
---
Not really if unlocking the skin bound the infusion to your account.  
---
Right now, if you have infusions, you can use an extractor and sell your infusion. That makes the number of infusions to only increase with time. And super rare infusions with 10k prices still have really low drop rates, and not a lot of guys wear more than one. So i don't think the price will be cut by half with this method.
---
Need to get to a guild with shimmering. I think it's Glided guild hall that have them.
---
If you think mythic raids are what's keeping wow alive, you don't know enough about MMOs to continue this conversation. No other MMO has the clout Wow has, because it had a head start. But even WoW can't boast the 12.4 million it had in it's heyday. WoW has lost more people than this game ever had playing it.
---
In fact, WOW stopped reporting numbers when their paid sub base fell below 4 million from 12. 4 million   So it's a 15 year old game that lost 2/3s of it's population.
---
It's not about whether it's making more or not. That's really not the question. NO other MMO is making what WoW did, so how can you possibly use that as an example. It's an anomaly having come out at a time when there was very very little competition and no free to play MMOs at all.  And it had a huge war chest to advertise from other games that were successul Like Starcraft and Warcraft 2. 
---
THat situation has never been repeated and no other game can match that. I mean what other MMO had commericals on TV with Mr. T, William Shatner and Chuck Norris in them?
---
I might be a boomer, it's true. Which means I was there when it happened and maybe I know a thing or two. :)
---
Well, you got paid and got entertainment 😹
---
Use drops and quest rewards until you hit 80. There's nothing super-duper amazing until you get there.
---
Headphones?
---
You would need only 1 infusion instead of 8 to stack auras, you would have the aura of 8 chak eggs with 20k gold instead of 160k
---
Too much logic my guy.
---
YESSSSSSSSSSHHHHHHHHHHH. GIMMEEEEH DEM LOOTZ!
---
Seriously though, great job guys. Amazing as always! Looking forward to this month :D!
---
Thanks :)
---
Ngl, I always thought she was the most unreasonable of Destiny's Edge during their infighting phase. Even considering Logan.
---
Arah !!!!
---
Orr !!
---
Every instance also...
---
@queicherius You are awesome man! Your site is the best addition to Gw2 ever and you are an amazing developer.
---
Wonderful!!
---
Raids are good, check em out in this pressure free environment, bonus points for being asura/elementalist, because asura love,  ele life &lt;3
---
Ugh, yes. The sheer disrespect while we were saving her... It's fun to have someone the Commander can banter with (read: Canach), but she's just not funny at all. Then there's the fact she dragged us into that Shining Blade nonsense.
---
People talking about how scrapper provides nothing new to the table but then run double druid.
---
Scrapper has stability, projectile block, cc in form of stun and push, damage absorption and superspeed. It is better on more immobile bosses because of the narrow cone of medkit 1.
---
For now use: https://gw2efficiency.com/ 
---
Full account overview with account value, characters inventories, currencies etc. Also has recipes for crafting, worldboss timer, node overview for gathering and more.
---
mmm lootboxes yum
---
Or add some epic loot to the game instead of the money store
---
In addition to the other comment: follow the green star for the next story step, it might be on the next map.
---
Either by having a guild that has that guild hall or from low rng  from the ore node in Glided Hollow, sometimes you can also buy with guild commendations
---
So u dont mind ppl semi afk aaing metas coz they are 100% benefit. Ok
---
500 gems, characterbound.
---
unranked has a low queue time. So must be a lot of people playing. including myself. It does suck that the rewards are trash because there are so many of us there. It's very relaxed, for the most part and a more enjoyable experience. The only way to get the same experience in ranked is to play with your chat turned off, which is sad.
---
This comment was like entire gw2 community embodied as one
---
I'd rather see the mastery implemented as: "After you survive fall damage, gain barrier/health/buff/whatever"
---
For future design work, as well as keeping older stuff consistent, I expect it's better to get rid of fall damage reduction altogether and replace it with something that helps you cope with taking fall damage after it's happened.
---
Do the Daily every day to get 2g and you can afford a set soon.
---
Also search gear on TP by defining stats, rarity and level, not searching for a name.
---
I run it in two places.
---
1. The ghost event after vg with zephyr runes and full gyros.
---
Superspeed and stability spam with projectile destruction carries harder than even the best Chrono here.
---
2. Slothasaur with less experienced groups.
---
Seems designed to counter all the mechanics of the sloth fight if you approach the fight "as intended" which is usually how the low dps/inexperienced groups I join start.
---
However, if people are experienced, all bets are off, you can run pretty much anything. Power creep is real. Sadly most people would rather shave off a minute or two of fight time than get creative, but that's where the game is at the moment for pugging.
---
HoT specialisition weapons are not freely stat selectable.
---
They only offer a choice of 1 of 3 stats, the available stats vary from weapon to weapon.
---
nah,lets just remove all interesting mechanics from the game.
---
Not braindead enough, you still need a tank, hand kite, goop kite.
---
How does it work if I want the copper tier supporter? Pledge a custom amount of $5 via Patreon?
---
Majory and Kas, They legit just end up being damsals in distress or just get in the way. All the way through season 4 they didn't feature hardly at all and I didn't even notice. It also doesn't help that they are token characters meant to be the rep for anyone who is Gay, which I mean is ok but not if they are just there to BE GAY and offer nothing to the plot. Their relationship was childish at first then hardly featured in the forefront and then they kinda just split, We haven't had motivations or really any real development for them.  
---
They kinda bloat our cast now and I feel we only need one of them, I think Kas is the worst offender. She is obnoxious as fuck and I just can't stand her as a character where with Jory I kinda like her. She has grown a bit and with her sisters death sure, she has had her fair share of ups and downs where as Kas has just gone from Six Fanatic to slightly less fanatic. Jory to me is the stronger of the two and plus her being a necromancer could offer some interesting things due to how she can see and feel things we can't (Unless we are a necro ourselves) Though they might be setting up to replace her with Jhavi.  
---
Rox kind of fell flat early on but I liked her by the end, Its sad that she is no longer with the team.
---
Farming the map and Strike Missions
---
or just give us a flat 50% reduction in pve only and handle wvw somehow else
---
But where's the fun in that? Where's the gameplay? 
---
Also that would require another , likely as and probably more complicated, solution for WvW. And it would make the modes feel terribly different in movement abilities
---
&gt; PvP arenas should have been real world (Tyria) locations, and WvW should have been neutral territories where we join guild alliances and fight each other on proxy wars for the Tyrian factions.
---
Hm... intresting, you mean like some sort of... guild wars?
---
&gt; WvW would have required changes in the early plot, but it wouldn't have been very difficult.
---
WvW has plot?
---
Bladed armour sets from the vendor's in HoT would be the next for stat selectable sets.
---
Am I misreading? From the log it looks like all guardians have used traps as well.
---
Join a guild with Lost Precipice as their guild hall.
---
I feel like I am one of the few people that actually think this is a good meta. There are so many comps you can run. Before it was run double chrono everywhere and fill with some dps classes. Now we have stack dgh in 1 sub with renegade, double chrono, boon thief, boon dd, support firebrand and power chronos
---
That goose drank Braham under the table.
---
give quickness to everyone ez fix
---
What you're suggesting is to just give everyone fall damage reduction. The majority of players would be able to blow through a new mastery line in a couple of days. 
---
In WvW, it would be even worse. Most players have already maxed out every possible WvW mastery, so they would take 10 seconds to buy the fall damage trait and immediately have a massive advantage over new players.
---
&gt;The Tactics trait "Marching Orders" gives the "Soldier's Focus" buff, which I think is causing the gold sparkles.
---
Huh, I didn't know that. Are there any other traits in the game that give you a visible aura?
---
Whatever you do, don't eat that snow.
---
Something I've been working on. I'm planning to do a full arrangement of Blish's Sorrow and more of the OST. Thanks for listening!
---
Well shit this is so awesome.
---
Different teams but we know what you mean
---
Well ye if you look at the current meta that might be true, thought we were talking about this comp.
---
Reminder to reintroduce the screaming falling sounds for pplayers that don't have gliding/mounts unlocked
---
So that's what Anet is truly working on
---
rather make boon duration more potent for quickness or smt and reduce base durations accordingly. This way you wouldnt fuck over support classes
---
Finally, some good fucking memes.
---
Make it take up 1 point in WvW and call it a day. No need to require 100 like the stupid cat or lvl 2000 like legendary armor.
---
This should be the top comment.
---
Tell me about it. I have like 1,800 charges
---
They sorta had a weird disadvantage thing before PoF and hoT were bundled; people who owned PoF but not HoT couldn't fly away, yes they'd have a mount but you can't mount in combat and if your squads retreating and gliding away your stuck being killed or having to jump, especially on RGBL. But that's not a huge problem, just made me think of that cause I had to do that before on an alt account.
---
Cultural amor from char. And I have not a single char character.  Guaranteed unlock is trash
---
But these are 100% dps oriented builds. 98.5%, since using dragon maw adds around 1.5% of total dps. If they needed to sacrifice a lot to provide such valuable and essential group support, that would be totally ok. They don't need to.
---
To be completely honest, we don't know either - because we have never gotten an answer to any of our applications. At this point, all we really want it for ANet to just acknowledge we exist. /shrug
---
Aww, thank you!
---
I would whisper some random guy with like 4-5 different accounts in the same short window of time with something like 
---
"Hey man, someone was saying you're giving away 100g for the first whisper, did I win?"
---
And keep doing it so they think there is some douche running around using their name for a giveaway.
---
Or i would sent them a single onion in the mail from each account, every 2nd day of the week at 2pm but not send anything else and ignore any questions.
---
&gt; I am NOT a vampire
---
Lemme guess, you also happen to dislike garlic, right?
---
Monthly support is like a subscription - you pay a lower amount, but you pay it every month.
---
Lifetime support can be either a one-time payment of the equivalent of 5 months up front, or is the total amount you supported with the montly subscription.
---
So you can (for example), subscribe for 1$ / month to get the Copper Benefits, or pay 5$ up front. And if you stay subscribed for 1$ for 5 months, you get to keep it permanently, even if you cancel. :)
---
Very true, he's amazing. Big props to him.
---
Then it's just a gone gameplay as it is going to be anyway.
---
Si do it just like dyes? Click on show/hide unlockex.
---
&gt; Pvp is the backbone behind the success of every popular/most profitable game out there in today's age. For example, if you go to twitch and browse by category, https://www.twitch.tv/directory, the top most popular games all have polished their multiplayer/pvp experience to the best that they could.
---
MMOs aren't that popular on twitch. When they are, it's because the game just came out and mainstream streamers play it (Atlas was a shit show but most mainstream streamers played it when it came out so lot of "hype"). And WoW... When a new WoW expansion comes out, there's a lot of hype around it, and it's about rushing PvE and the first raid progress mostly. Then it dies out. So judging the popularity of a game relying solely on twitch is a bad idea. Trends come and go, and most of the time it's also about what big streamers like, not about what players like.
---
Anet doesn't exactly have a history of putting non-combat stuff into the game, or replacing gameplay depth they took away.
---
The character designs are drawn in the style of Untitled Goose Game.
---
And here I am with 30 charges left because I keep changing looks ;;
---
Great! Not bad at all. 163rd out of 42399 entries is really good. 5,2 million view hours is over 590 years, which is amazing amount for 365 days (1 year). I watched whopping 2 hours this year!
---
The database makes mistakes, both in the mystic toilet and on the trading post.
---
Anet gave me back stacks of mats that were making a legendary weapon in the third year because the mystic toilet made the wrong things completely, losing me any chance to get my legendary 'made' which was only two steps away.
---
People are banned by ArenaNet for telling any truth, but some can get away with calling them liars and more but never get banned - proof that some are favored above others and any truth-teller will be banned if they actually show proof of mistakes and botched maintenance in the game.
---
If I hadn't screenshotted every single step of the mystic toilet error, Anet would not have returned my stacks of mats - and they never even apologized.
---
backs are coded as weapons. weapons were undyable for whatever reason.
---
Kc also has reduced armor
---
&gt;so why exactly are we still not able to color backpieces?
---
because that way they can sell you different versions of same backpack separately.
---
Why does it seem like Rytlock has better quality than the other two new npc.
---
I was also thinking about anet expanding on the self harm mechanic. Its wildly underused but such a metal concept Id love to see put into use. Also, not sure if you've ever used dagger, but dagger 3 is by far the best animation ever. Dunno why I love it so much but its so incredibly metal lol
---
bcs its free marketing.
---
Yes, it's called wardrobe, and it's in the bank.
---
this also explains why they probably will never retrofit back items with a dye system
---
I always like the dodge idea.
---
It's disappointing when you dodge as you land and nothing special happens.
---
I would go with a new mastery line available to Free and Core players, so they can have a taste of the Mastery system and use some of the mastery points they can already earn with core achievements. It could be called something like "Heroic Stunts". 
---
* High Fall Training
---
 * Reduces Fall damage by 25%.
---
* Heroic Landing
---
 * Triggers a skill upon landing. (Brings back the fall skills, and also changes the fall animation when the fall is survivable to [something more heroic-looking](https://youtu.be/mgOtPXDyKjA))
---
* Rolling Fall:
---
 * Using a dodge right before landing reduces fall damage by another 25%. A Rolling Fall does not trigger Heroic Fall. 
---
* Silent Landing.
---
 * Rolling Fall gives stealth for 2s and refunds endurance when performed successfully.
---
&gt;a predominantly casual MMO
---
This is a lie. GW2 was conceptualized as an esport, and still technically is. (Even if it's seen brighter days..)
---
Yes, the story is casual. Everything else isn't. And the story isn't what people stream.  People stream raids, pvp, wvw, and sometimes fractals.
---
they should just remove slow from timewarp to make chrono stack harder due to danger time,
---
and rework feel my wrath and move the quickness to the firebrand elite mantra while making mantra of potence something else than it is rn...
---
in the end dh shouldnt have self quickness and firebrand should have to use at least a bit boon duration to maintain it...
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
or just make all chrono quickness 10 man ... it is op but then again you can play whatever dps you want
---
[deleted]
---
Oh great, I really run short on them
---
...
---
nah, just kidding. still got thousands
---
My characters have had the same looks for years because I did all my splurging on armor years ago and don’t do any PvE fashion wars hunting anymore lol. Doing ranked everyday helps also
---
not related to twitch, but when lazypeon made a video about why he liked gw2 on youtubea year ago that got considerable traction, suddenly there was a surge in threads about gw2's customer service being slow and dornsinger or someone else said they have had an influx of new players thus the queues were longer.
---
Every little bit helps, even if your average gw2 doesn't watch twitch, others do and who knows how many would end up giving gw2 a chance. Hell, even if they were &lt;1%, that's a win in my book
---
Yeah, there are plenty of comps you can run, as long as they stack guardians heavily, both in the dps and the support slots. Great meta.
---
only if it doesn't have a piano rotation of all skills
---
PoE more watched then FF14? nice
---
I'd disagree a lot with this, GW2 was and always has been the "MMO for everyone" and while they had an esports hype in 2014 and 2015 with WvW and PvP respectively it's still very much a casual MMO. They tried to push esports more, yes. They did this by streamlining the the skills and all, having only one class instead of double ones etc. But this was also part of the "MMO for everyone" thing. But look at GW2 it's always been majorly casual.
---
Working on it
---
I have over 30 characters, I redesign gear fairly often, I rarely map complete or play competitive modes.
---
I now have 14 transmutation charges, so these have been very welcome :p
---
i was thinking when we get the no gliding debuff in our bar, it also applies the FDR buff as part of it.
---
When staff weaver was meta we didn't also have a meta support ele build like guards currently do. I'm very happy the domination of the boon chronos got wrecked, but all they did was replace a stale meta with another stale meta featuring less classes overall.
---
Ye I know about that but they added minis too and so many yeah thay it is long and boring. Cheaper to buy what u Need whenu want
---
Gw2 dead game.
---
The fun thing was they introduced it close to the end of the month, so if you didn't immediately jump on it, you had to wait another month.
---
Never bothered me, really.
---
I would personally favor a consumable crafted by artificers. A feather fall potion for lack of a better name. Could grant % reduction for a certain number of minutes.
---
Why do I like this more? Because it feeds into the economy and has a cost. If it's a mastery it will soon feel like you always had the reduction and there is no cost to it. Basically it makes it the new baseline, which I don't think is healthy.
---
Guys if a game is not popular on twitch you can t call it dead is just more fun to play that watch or thas not have too many fun streamera
---
Here's some funny things:
---
* Backs appeared briefly in the Dye panel because of a bug. You would go to the Mounts tab, back to the gear tab, and the back would magically appear at the bottom of the list, but no skin would have dye channels.
---
* That got fixed, but it's still possible to 'see' the back in the Dye panel:
---
 * Go to the wardrobe
---
 * Select the back.
---
 * Select a different skin for the back.
---
 * Keep the back selected.
---
 * Without accepting the changes, switch to the dye view.
---
 * The back will now appear behind the "confirm changes" box. But you can only see the bright outline and the button to cancel the skin selection.
---
So it would seem that at least internally they have at least considered making backs dyeable, but there's no sign it was more than a test. Maybe just a side-project in the free time of an employee that isn't there anymore.
---
Why is this comment divisive?..
---
Anet has ruined PvP not bots, idle player, bad match making or not exisiting class balance.
---
what about when youre trying to land on a very small ledge, you want to dodge straight off it?
---
You don't dodge and still get 25% damage reduction.
---
Don't put too much credence in all the doom saying. There are a lot of frustrated veterans right now but there is no actual sign that the game is dying (hard content just isn't being focused on currently by the devs in the new content releases). It is still full of people and you will have a massive amount of content to do as a new player.
---
&gt; for whatever reason.
---
because they (some) are animated
---
&gt; But these are 100% dps oriented builds
---
A guardian in the hands of a good player is never 100% dps oriented, that's the entire point of this profession.
---
A build with abilities that enhance allies will and should always be better in a 10 player enviroment than a selfish build in a squad. How do you want to prevent stacking FMW and Signet of Courge? Add a 250 concentration or healing power treshhold before the quickness or healing gets applied?
---
runes of firebrand have quickness duration, boon duration, and quickness on elite no?
---
So now two metrics have shown a dying game: Reddit and Twitch viewership. This is like tobacco companies saying cigarettes don’t cause cancer when study after study proves otherwise.
---
You know what "free marketing" is yes?
---
Biggest problem is the performance. Who wants to watch a 20 fps stream?
---
even when they skip the orb phase?
---
working on what? on destroying our pristine community? You and your cronies are nothing but a bunch of toxic bullies that stir up drama at every opportunity they have.
---
This subreddit used to be peachy until your "operation meme storm" ruined it.
---
How did Old School RuneScape and RuneScape place?
---
A big thanks to all the Redditors that pointed this out time and time again.
---
wow, what a bunch of shit people
---
I spent more time on KC 10 man than 5 man.
---
One word : lul
---
&gt; Make fall damage reduction baseline in the entire game.
---
That already happened years ago when they decided that fall damage would be based on X rather than 1.25*X or 7*X. Suggesting that *everyone* should have fall damaged reduction without requiring any offsetting penalty is just dumb.
---
Next request will be a mastery that gives 10% damage reduction.
---
After that a mastery that gives 25% speed boost at all times.
---
Fuck it, let's just have a mastery that gives all boons at maximum with a 24 hour duration that refreshes itself every time you jump.
---
Im thinking about buying the expansion, so from what I understand, path of fire gives heart of thorns as well?  Does anyone know of any sales for black friday/cyber Monday?
---
How does one set it up?
---
You can only preview 4 dyes, not individual dye channles on each armor piece
---
not the first post of this
---
To win a million gems
---
OSRS 26 and RS 128, those two now included in the first post
---
You can just adjust that by adding durations in firebrands kit accordingly, besides lets not act like firebrand is already underperforming :)
---
This is the game arenanet was told to cancel by ncsoft.
---
I disagree as a jumping  puzzle speed runner and someone who helps thousands of players actually achieve them in game. Fall damage affects more than just combat situations. Being such, I would hope that any solution here is thoroughly thought through to take into account the potential effects on All systems of gameplay and their communities. Very large communities have been built around high altitude exploration and fall damage not only helps to survive mistakes, but very importantly opens up new routes for speed runs, skilled rescues of players you are helping, exploration, etc.   Just another point of view to add to the puzzle of making the correct final adjustments.
---
 I see regular "hey Im new, any tips" or "hey, is it worth to buy?" posts in twitch chat.. on any stream I watch... so, you are wrong. This whole "twitch is only for veterans" is absolute nonsense, spread by people that got slapped in twitch chat because they were being a backseatdriving know-it-all or just too dense to realize what a big marketing tool twitch has become.
---
There seems to be a lot of uncalled for snark in this thread. Just because you might be rolling in charges, it doesn’t mean others are. Free charges are grand as far as I’m concerned.
---
"Potion of Silk Landings" gives fall damage reduction and finally offers some use for those pesky cheap silk scraps
---
I like the idea, yet I doubt it would see much use, as most players can already avoid fall damage altogether in most scenarios except JPs. 
---
They could still implement it though, as I dont see any possible conflicts really
---
I'm sure you're referring to how positive the subreddit used to be, but that's far from being equivalent to a pristine community. Just like there are people who will harass you if you say you enjoy the game, there used to be plenty of people who would harass you for even constructive criticism. The overall outlook of the subreddit has changed over time (and not even really related to Teapot's memes), but the toxicity underneath has been somewhat of a constant. The core game design promotes cooperation that makes the community feel kinder, but you get the same behavior as any other game when it isn't enforced by game mechanics.
---
Operation meme storm lmao. That is something I tried to use to hype people about the game and has nothing to do with reddit!
---
Eh, no. From the start of development, they wanted to have a heavy PvP focus on GW2. However, you're right that it didn't persist until launch. I'm going to assume that the main devs who championed that idea left at some point during development. You'd be correct to say that GW2 was a PvE-focused game at launch, but it wasn't intended to be easy. They outright stated that dungeons, and even the game as a whole, was supposed to be difficult. At release, there were tons of complaints about how the dungeons were too difficult. However, as people got more used to the combat system, that content began to feel easier. At that point, any time they tried to introduce more difficult content, they did run into backlash. They found that niche of the casual gamer on accident; it wasn't the intent from the start.
---
TL;DR - While true now, GW2 wasn't designed to be a super casual game.
---
KUH-HONK
---
It already is feelsamazingman
---
It was not made to be an esport until HoT. Pre-HoT was pure casual; therefore, it could not have been the concept to be as such. Someone was not here long. Even now, open world PvE is the main game mode supported by dev team which is the casual side of the whole game.
---
eh; if im doing cooking and i wanna check if all the food for the rare/exotic/common extracts of nourishment made cheaper using crafting or tp ; there are loads of them so i was just wondering if there is a way to just put them all in i guess
---
Alright, thanks!
---
I'm just saying what I'm seeing. I only see DDs on Qadim, I only see renegades on Dhuum and mirages have always been around since we have the spec. Power chronos and sword weavers are technically viable, but all I see are people bringing dhs unless they stubbornly main ele/mes.
---
It's even worse in fractals. DH dps, fb support, rene, war. 0 variance.
---
what a deal!!1!
---
I can see that I need to provide more context. The routes that fall damage provide are not for me to finish the puzzle for me. They are so I can go backwards on the puzzle more quickly and efficiently hardkour parkour style to assist others in multiple locations at once who need help while under portal time constraints. Any pro jp speed runner who helps large groups understands this. We do a lot of behind the scenes stuff and on the front lines for the many thousands we have helped over the years. I personally have ported over 20,000 (yes I kept track for fun) so far people on jps to help them finish it themselves (not skipping it for them) lol. Just trust us. If you are one of the ones who prefer to do them without help, the more power to you. :D And before anyone asks, yes I play the game for the parkour and I like to help people and groups learn to love to jump! :D
---
Is that a surprise? Poe is watchable like diablo. Ff14 is only cool to watch when theres new raid
---
The numbers are tweakable, obviously. 
---
Always 50% removing fall damage on the other hand is nothing but an unnecessary megabuff to an already very generous game mechanic. Especially forced on all players im positive only a minority would enjoy it. 
---
There was another comment about adding a FDR potion, maybe thats for you?
---
This is the proxemics lab guild puzzle
---
I didn’t know people actually bought and sold Eternity
---
Also, who the hell downvoted me?
---
Great job! Waiting for the sheet music =D
---
Elite Dangerous
---
The only thing different now from LS1 is that they don't permanently disable all the content when the next episode comes out.
---
i don't pvp I'll take all the transmutation charges i can get
---
A lot of people craft eternity and then sell it since they're still left with Sunrise and Twilight skins
---
We dont precast the traps for burst, they trigger when the statues come in which is kind of late into the fight
---
What he meant was that kc has low toughness. You get around 36% dmg extra because of this
---
Looks like he drank too much
---
Hahaha I actually did that with a few friends once, but it was on Warframe not GW2.
---
The guy fully believed it and tried to 'save' the guy who was being subjugated. He found it pretty funny after we explained it though, a good sport all around.
---
There are still enough armor sets and weapons that can be bought with gems, some armors are really nice to have (or at least parts of them). So I think this more an argument FOR showing locked armor and weapons than against it, and highlight available stuff currently in store.
---
It's not ideal, you're throwing away birthday gifts.  Especially if it's your only character that old.
---
I'm wondering which class should I level to 80 using the boost. I have Guardian, Mesmer, Warrior, and Engineer already at 80, and none of the classes have really appealed too much to me. I love playing the Guardian the most, and admittedly not tried the other classes much that I've not gotten to 80 yet. They all seem interesting gameplay wise from reading, but actual playing I think I've gotten too used to the Guardian to do well at playing anything else.
---
Fucking tengu thieves
---
A simple switch showing all or owned stuff would do the trick, as far as I remember other tabs already have this.
---
thats what I did shortly after the wardrobe came out and before they updated eternity to have extra effects
---
Maybe from https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heavy_Thorned_Bag_(masterwork) but that will depend on drop rates.
---
Yes, it is true for all, but not to the same degree. Some games have a higher percentage of players who watch more than play.
---
I'm not going to argue either way, but it's hard to argue the impact of that without actual numbers. It's kind of a pointless argument without them.
---
 ^ Is this a copypasta or is this person posting unironically? Someone help me out here.
---
If anything the biggest problem is effect overload.
---
Doesnt matter what a streamer does, all high level gameplay boils down to shitty glow explosions where nobody can tell whats going on.
---
&gt; Eh, no. From the start of development, they wanted to have a heavy PvP focus on GW2. However, you're right that it didn't persist until launch.
---
So it launched without a PvP focus and your entire argument revolves around semantics.
---
GW2 is not a PvP game. Evident by looking at the frequency of updates for the various game modes.
---
Well, it's hard to offer advice without knowing what you look for in a class, and what aspects of the other classes you've played appeal to you/turn you off.
---
Engineer has a lot of buttons to press if you equip several kits, so if you like that aspect of having lots of abilities available to you, Elementalist might scratch that itch.  On the other hand, if Engineer simply has too many buttons and you want something with a simpler rotation, Thief could be what you're looking for, with the initiative system in place of weapon skill cooldowns.
---
Necromancer and Ranger both offer survivability, either in the form of a ton of HP or a pet to draw some fire from you.  But if you're not having trouble managing the more active defence style of Guild Wars 2 on your current characters, that survivability might not appeal to you.
---
And that leaves Revenant.  Like Guardian, Revenant is in a good spot right now, with many possible builds available for the Renegade elite specialization just like with Firebrand.  If nothing else I've said thus far appeals to you, then Revenant might be worth trying.
---
You can always take your test character to PvP, where you can equip all elite specs and test them out on training dummies, before actually using the boost.  Yes, the boost also lets you test in the Silverwastes, but only with core specializations and with subpar equipment to boot.  The PvP lobby should be a better testing environment, and you can do all that without needing to actually fight any players.
---
Thank you very much for the answer!
---
Wow this is such a bad advice.
---
He/She should just save the money from Ascend and go straight for Legendary gear. I mean its probatly less than 10.000 gold which one can easily aquire by playing the auction house or farming riba for a year. 
---
Srsly tho by the time a fresh character hits 80 it should have aquired at least 30+ gold(was the case when i stsrted 2y ago). Unless exo prices increased in the last 2 years that should be enough for even berserker lvl 80 gear with some cheap runes.
---
And that would be still ok with this conversion system.
---
Airship parts can be used to buy Bladed armor, which is dirt cheap selectable stat exotic armor. I would save airship parts in case you ever want to test builds.
---
You could cut the base value in half. 8sec quickness on a 45sec cd is quite ridiculous isnt it? Compare entire dh to holo. Dh has more burst, blocks, easy mobility, close to invuln heal even without fmw. Dragonhunter is so incredible overtuned. Yes a guardian is never 100% dps oriented but why does he do more damage than full selfish glass specs like holo or reaper which have 0 support.
---
And signet share even stacks and is an easy 1.1k power boost for the group. pFB outdamages several dps specs in fractals aswell. Its that balanced.
---
or fb could play with boon duration. i know this sounds absurd but maybe a supp providing 100% quickness shouldnt be able to play in full dps gear outdamaging holo in the process. Or maybe playing with dh as only quickness source in fractals and having sub 5sec dps phases isnt healthy.
---
Don't forget placing conjures so you can take them up later or lose dps... And then losing it anyway because someone else stole them.
---
Statistics don't support that claim tho. They do seem to care, just not about max potential but rather for the best result/effort ratio.
---
Good sports make everything in life so much better lol
---
For some reason GW2 looks stunning in-game and absolutely poo-like on screenshots and videos. Can someone explain this to me?
---
If weapons were dyable - some skins would lose its value and exclusivity. I guess same goes for the backpieces.
---
more awful than expected, nice
---
Suggets you read downthread for comparisons with other competitiors.
---
ok
---
Don't tell him, he doesn't know.
---
You want to easily increase twitch viewers for GW2?
---
Let me tell you how.
---
Get some twitch thots playing GW2.
---
EZ!
---
You mean big names like Angry Joe or Kripp would might have stuck with it if they had better management and more consistent content release early on or didn't ban players for trying out a logical way to make gold not realizing it'd be considered an exploit by devs?
---
*Sigh.* Alas, such ships have sailed.
---
try watching the vod or read the comments
---
It depends. Actually exploring the map can be quite some fun. It wouldn't be fun to watch though, which might be a reason it's not that high on twitch. Just not the right type of game.
---
Why would I want to watch someone else play GW2 live? Maybe some fun WvW commander for 10 minutes, but that's about it. After that I'd rather play myself. It's just not the type of game to watch.
---
Angry Joe would never stick to one game for long. His job is to review games and hop from one trend to another.
---
Kripparian is a pretty hardcore dude. GW2 never really stood a chance to hold his attention. If pvp was as well refined back then as it is now, then maybe that could've. But I still kinda doubt it.
---
And when I say spvp is refined, I mainly mean the gameplay and reward systems it has.
---
can buy some pact crowbars or machetes and go open chests in VB or DS. might get some cash that way
---
ye i thought about adding that but i see conjures more as an advantage
---
If you liked the direction All or Nothing took, then I’m afraid I have some bad news...
---
I just don't get it. I'm literally just saying I use a build in fractals all the time and it works just fine. Why would that be downvote-worthy?
---
Co-op works as well.
---
I did this achievement with a friend and we both go it, after i shadowstepped to the hiding spot.
---
Didn't you say you didn't want to browse this subreddit anymore? Go do that.
---
I wonder what days those were, I played since release and they were never rare.   
---
Maybe you were just worse at obtaining them before?
---
Quality bait. GW2 community was super toxic from day 1.
---
I'm sure someone somewhere already expressed the same idea more eloquently, but this specifically, no.
---
You don't even need 6 sets. Difference between tanks, healers, condition builds, direct power etc. could easily be integrated into traits, too. Mastery A = heal, mastery B = dps, mastery C =cdps.
---
Says something that the most unbelievable part of this is a new expansion. Well done!
---
They could just buff reaper.
---
internet explorer i guess
---
As someone that like changing the looks on all my charactersbdiff tent armor sets regularly these are very welcome.
---
The same thing can be said about BDO though (rank 40). There aren't any big streamers that play that game anymore and the ones that have only talk about its negatives like Asmon (who has talked about it once) and Lacari (who isn't a big streamer). Despite such a negative impression on practically every streamer that played, why does it still maintain consistent stream numbers with an average of 1,500-2,000 people watching it any given time. Actually, there are over 3,000 viewers right now for no reason like a big content update.
---
FF14 has arguably less variety of things to do and BDO has unarguably less variety of things to do but they still maintain higher stream numbers.
---
I think there are 2 reasons (as far as i can think right now at least):
---
1) Gw2 came out, I'd say, 2-3 years too early and didn't really catch onto the Twitch explosion. In Conjunction, anecdotally, I'd say gw2 playerbase has a higher average age than every other game, attributing to its "vast" casual playerbase. Then again, Archeage, Maplestory came out before then as well so I wouldn't say it's strictly the reason.
---
2) Gw2 isn't very challenging nor is it very deep. The gamemodes that are challenging like highend raids or top PvP are mechanically deep but the communities are far too small because for raids, there's a content drought, and for PvP, it's stale. 
---
Also, I think, because its tab-targetting and dodge is the most important mechanic in the game, it's one-dimensional so the nuance isn't as compelling. McHands, the best NA BDO warrior, streams, maybe, once a month and gets 200-400 everytime he streams and all he does is pvp duels when he does. And he plays on the lowest settings possible (to get the most frames and minimize clutter).
---
Good thought with the silk. Yeah I doubt it would get much too. Fall damage traits were veeeery niche at this point. Still, it keeps it for those who want it and the potions would likely end up dirt cheap.
---
In my case WvW. Not quite as many but still have 300+.
---
Who cares.
---
Congratz on the 2s49c !!
---
red+blue. everything after sucked
---
No, the only armor that is aninimated (legendary) has huge problems with dying
---
PvP is the only mode in this game worth watching and its dead so nothing new.
---
Wow Oldschool runescape has that many people watching?
---
Or it is a person who multiboxing and have a macro that tells him when he is being whispered or a macro for auto response. 
---
Either way there is no reason for you to whisper them at all. If you belive they are afk or bots then report them and let Arena Net find out.They are the only one that can determind if it is or is not. 
---
Usually though were afk people claim they are not really afk, when ever Arena Net have their ban hammer wave going all those spots are totally cleared out. Makes you wonder why that is...
---
The problem was what happened between the episodes.
---
Only in places where you can't glide, like activities (e.g. Winter Wonderland, Southsun Survival)
---
it would place higher if it was a "least watched games" list
---
Obviously they would "purchase" it for mystic coins or something as collateral.
---
ah thanks sry for bothering you
---
In different parts of Pve you should play different builds.
---
deathmagic, even after the recent rework, is completely worthless for PvE. there is nothing useful or interesting in there unless you want to solo cheese some champs.
---
What can they put into it? Not that many big streamers are actually that open to playing a 7 y/o game for money. Streamers like Shroud or Summit1g make a ton in donations alone per hour and while anet may (huge IF) pay them more than that total, I can't imagine forcing yourself to sit through a dated and tried game. 
---
Consider that a huge streamer has a rate of $1 per avg viewer PER HOUR to companies wanting them to play their games. Does Anet have the capital to pay big streamers $20k+ per hour to play their game? The tutorial alone takes 20-30 minutes and the leveling process isn't exactly compelling or quick enough to watch or warrant trying the game. Really, the most fun and engaging parts to a new player in this game is the end-game content like open-world metas or WvW.
---
I've played 700 hours since january and I have less than 50 left... I don't know where everyone's getting loads of them. I guess PvP and WvW but I don't play those.
---
Yes speak not of the games decline just pretend it's all good 👍
---
Most PvE mechanics are visually obvious if you know a little about the game. Most PvP mechanics involve reacting to animations hidden by clutter or predicting them. Unlike most popular eSports, there tends to not be major plays that can be easily pointed out. The visual clutter got MUCH worse with HoT, as elite spec animations were designed without a bit of concern for the visual clutter.
---
It is watchable from a macro perspective, it's easy to tell what the score is, who has what cap, etc. But trying to work out what the Firebrand just did when you have an explosion of particle and ground effects going off when three or more players meet means its hard to keep track of the actual fights. I bet ANet are kicking themselves for not adding an option to cull spell effects (or add a proper spectator mode like GW1 had that showed which abilities were being used) when they were developing GW2. I get the feeling its too late to add that option now.
---
&gt; Thats just making excuses the twitch audience would be much larger if Anet actually put anuything into it.
---
Anet is too PC for the internet. Which is unfortunate if your only product is an MMO. They chose to live in a bubble and interact as little with the community as possible, while also doing 0 community building.
---
"Tillamooker;
---
Fine, you can help. But stay close, and be careful."
---
I can read it silky smooth..
---
Twitch has been unpopular with GW2 players since launch. This has been known for years.
---
It is well worth supporting gw2efficiency on patreon. One of the benefits is being auto entered into the draws like this.
---
I just redid the story instance where we lost Blish and it broke my heart all over again. When Gorrik says "but I saved him" kills me every single time. ;_;
---
&gt; Anet is too PC for the internet.
---
What?
---
I highly recommend a let's play, this game is better watched imo. Markiplier does a good job of it.
---
or the pof one which drops both
---
Dodge on E? How do you dodgejump?
---
Quality content!
---
PvE power damage reaper: I ran Reaper-Spite-SoulReaping in the past. But, after the last balance patch I found better results by switching out Soul Reaping with Death Magic. Death line can give you good condi removal (which has QoL in PvE to quickly get ooc and mount back up), lots of toughness and power from carapace, and perma protection. In open world PvE you rarely need life force boosts from Soul Reaping since trash mobs die frequently.
---
Idk why other commenters say death magic is bad in PvE. I think PvE may be the only viable game mode for death magic.
---
not in daylight
---
Minor correction: Nightfall did have the commander/hero battle PvP, and then that got replaced later around 2009 with Codex Arenas.
---
But that wouldn't feed the confirmation bias of the doomsayers, would it?
---
Both osrs and rs3 get frequent patches tho, Also B0aty basically always has 2-4k viewers daily.
---
&gt; Yes, they stuck with both modes for too long, but only true in the sense that they kept putting 'band-aid' fixes to both scenes without full support. This game would have been much better overall with proper management of dev time and focus. If they dropped WvW fully, for example, we might have had better dev focus on up-keeping PvP or the reversal.
---
Perhaps, although neither could be made truly viable, since the *audience* was never there to support either to the degree that it needed. If they wanted the PvP modes to be viable, they would have to at least remove the player vs player portions of them. 
---
&gt;Yes, they added 'band-aids' to both. PvP is getting new maps? It means nothing without a new game mode than 'king of the hill'. WvW got a mount? It killed roaming in WvW, and the balance is worse off now. How can you call that support?
---
They tried with Stronghold, and people didn't like it. What sort of PvP mode did you want? And the WvW mount wasn't exactly for WvW players, it was there to drag PvEers kicking and screaming into playing the mode for a few hours in the hopes that some would enjoy it and stick around. Nobody enjoyed it or stuck around. 
---
When there is not a sufficient audience for something, there's only so much you can do.
---
Same here... super confused.
---
Honestly I do enjoy watching real raid squads doing raids or someone cheesing fractals and speedrunning, but when u get to casual level, theres 80% downtime on every boss where people prepare + wipes. thats no fun.
---
What am incredibly pointless remark for something nobody has hard data on.
---
I don’t know as I stopped playing. The community always expected GW2 to really blossom from its release onward.  
---
Sometimes it did, with good quality of life changes and the addition of raids and certain fractals as well as HoT meta events.  
---
But, the game is 7 years old now and it seems the focus isn’t on improving and expanding upon the multiplayer content that actually shapes this community, meaning WvW, PvP, Raids, Fractals and Dungeons.  
---
From a new players perspective what matters is if that community is active enough to enjoy those modes (in my opinion). I don’t know if they are, but they are certainly well out of their prime because of a lack of constant content additions.  
---
Lastly, GW2 will never become the game that a lot of people hoped it would become, so don’t get your hopes up. In my opinion the game has come to its end already. That is unless you enjoy the open world content and Living Story, but to me the open world is mind numbingly boring and the Living Story is just not amazing but worth logging in and back out for.
---
Instead of just accepting it, you want to see why is that.
---
Gw2 is beautiful game but theres not tjust a lot of content to stream apart from PvP which stays stagnant over the years AND Arenanet doesnt even do advertising for it or giveaways at least to draw in more viewers.
---
People have all the rights to talk about flaws of the game they love. Its only good for new players to know what's up before investing thousands of hours into a game that might not be there in couple years. You can only blame Arenanet on this one.
---
I've never **ever** dropped a shimmering/tenebrous crystal in Windswept Haven. Its rare drop seems to be Obsidian Shards instead.
---
Not being on twitch is not necessarily indicative on in decline, and no one wants to hear that. This game has always sucked to watch. Too much visual spam on skills, for example. It's probably in decline for the hardest core players though.
---
What resolution is that? Looks like a background scaling issue. [Normally](https://ctrlaltrepeated.files.wordpress.com/2015/01/guild-wars-2-cutscene.jpg) the darker bar above the painted background serves as the dialogue background.
---
My friend who plays on 4k complains of the same issue, I didnt even think of my resolution.  Its 5120x1440 I also cant see character heads either most of the time :(.
---
First of all GW2 doesn’t make good use of threads so you need a lot of ghz on your CPU to make this thing run proper and even then there are areas where the frames will drop.  
---
Laptops are infamous for not being great with this game as their CPUs will often just get too hot. I’ve heard stories though where peoples fans were simply filled with dust and had to be cleaned out, maybe try that.  
---
Other tip is to set Character Model Limit to lowest or low. That’s the amount of other players that will be rendered around you, it eats a lot of performance if that’s high. You might have to set this to Medium though for certain raid encounters since some mechanics are bound to this setting too.
---
