There was no passive aggressive tone. If you feel that way, it comes from you. I put out content on my free time and you're free to dislike it. But if I make a nice gesture your way to try and solve your issue, and then get met with a flat no, that doesn't feel ok.
---

---
Hence why I simply said you sounded mad. Which I reiterate.
---
---
---
You have to buy them with gems in the gemstore (can convert gold, so it's still "free", but time consuming).
---
The cost aint too high on just an episode, but getting it free is always better.
---
If logging in everyday for possibly 20 seconds a day is a grind. You haven't played many other MMOs because it requires little to no effort (which isn't considered a grind). I think the word you're wanting is time gated if you're absolutely at 0 laurels. I agree with the daily logins though.
---
Probably also map currency (and volatile magic). That's how plaguedoctor's stuff worked in Kourna, if I'm not mistaken. Exotic inscription/insignias could not be crafted, you needed to buy them from merchants for 1250 VM + 25 map currency per piece. Basically, "if you want the new stat combo, do a whole lot of the new map."
---
They are very easy from Hearts though. One of the easiest hearts (S3E6 have the fastest I believe).
---
Top reason would be that you can buy both expacs for 24.99 Euro direct from GW2 webside. It is on sale until 14 th January.

just experiment, for pve any build is viable
---
He has been posting vids on youtube about it, had an article in the most recent edition in guild mag and is not the only one talking about this. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
In almost every podcast he hosts that topic is brought  up and the sitution is discussed. It has been reaching out to people I believe. 
---
From player position we can only guess what part of pirate Lions Arch is accessible but my guess is, since it is possible to enter that city via personal story instance that whole map is used but sliced into what's only needed for instance purposes. 
---
Anyway, [here's what I think could be included](https://i.imgur.com/Y6xkCGB.jpg). Rest would be working like map border does - pushing players away and have some fog/fractal mists design to implicate that this place isn't real or whatever else this VIP would require.
---
They look awesome, i'm doing daily clears again starting tomorrow for the first time since i got 250 essences and realized i didn't like the infusion 
---
&gt; i'm doing the same.   
---
85 laurel means 85 t6 bag. sine each one grants more or less 60 silver in mats this is 51 gold in mats.   
---
i'm crafting sharur atm . those weapons can wait. 
---
Lol? I have to accept an offer or I'm an angry person? Want to suck my dick or spend time downloading and watching something you dont want to see? 
---
Confused. I don't play renegade but what weapons do you recommend then if sword isn't good? Want to learn it in the future.
---
Could have said "no thanks" instead of a flat rebuttal. I see it's pointless to talk as you're on the defensive. Just have a good night man, it's ok.
---
Spent 300 of mine on t6 matts last week LMAO
---
it affects where you start the game (5 major races, 5 major cities), but after you get through the tutorial, you can waypoint to any of the other 4 starter areas to join your friend. It also affects the story up to level 30, after which point they start to converge.
---
On that note, each race has different choices when creating your character, and they can also change your story options. For humans for example, can choose to be a nobleman, a commoner, or a street rat, and that choice will dictate your level 10 story mission. 
---
I mean you are right about tutorials, but people figure out how to play their class at least a minimum amount. Having a gate at 80 where they need to learn at least somewhat meta strategies is in my opinion. What I always say when I am responding to posts where people ask about boosting is when you feel like you understand your class and maybe get tired of leveling or just want the endgame experience, feel free to boost. They will at least understand a bit of how weapon skills and utility skills work, what different stats do (mostly), and how trait lines work. That kind of basic understanding makes it much easier to springboard onto viable builds for endgame. 
---
It would be better if there were better tutorials and maybe even a tutorial (skippable) for boosted characters, but unfortunately we don't have that.
---
Alright, but the fact everyone is tiny makes up for it
---
You have waypoint unlocked in each races starting area.
---
Story missions will be different for each of you (up to lv 30 or so), but you can both enter them and just do both.
---
Youre convincing me to try to get a 1070ti GPU 😭😭😤😤😤 any advice? Could i get away with just upgrading my gpu or should I think about upgrading my processor AND coolant?
---
Yeah man. Plus try to tell the movie community that more than 24fps is better and watch them lose their minds. 
---
Teehee ;9
---
I bought it a few hours ago. I couldn’t find it on the site but I found a link when I clicked edit account on the in game pause menu. 
---
I would like to see thief get a support spec: arcane trickster, weapon: focus, abilities: boon steal and boon share 
---
For necro I feel like part of the reason for the epi nerf was introduce a single target spike condi spec.  Weapon could be rifle, mace or hammer, retain shroud but remove it's ability to absorb damage, abilities based on movement / shadowstep 
---
I also really like the idea of a duel pistol spellslinger spec for ele as a nod to poor Wildstar 
---
it felt really good getting it
---
My dog absolutely loves apple cores and after I finish one to the core, I call out "apples for sale!". She comes running when she hears that. I also call her Tybalt from time to time, much to the confusion of my mother. 
---
He cleared lots of bosses basically straight away with new people, it is not "too much work to be fun". Also isn't fun enough reward for raiding as this is a video game? :)
---
I don't really have too much of a problem getting volatile magic...if I just harvest the nodes in my home instance every day, after a month i think I can get about 4K-5K just from consuming the materials.  
---
Combine that with just running through the maps and harvesting those nodes, it builds up pretty fast.
---
Can't believe Aion is still alive but no City of Heroes or Wildstar, now that you bring it up. Goddamn.
---
It isn't really that much effort. He cleared quite a few bosses basically straight away with new people. Also I don't understand this "too much effort for reward" idea, what is wrong with putting effort in for rewards? Surely fun gameplay is a reward in itself, this is a video game after all :)
---
Your questions have mostly been answered so here's my tips as a returning player: 
---
1. Join at least one good guild that helps new players and answers questions. ( u can join 5 guilds)
---
2. If you want to buy gems to spend , wait until you know the game well enough to know what you actually need or want.
---
3. Don't get obsessed with min/maxing or being super elite , just have fun.
---
Demon-hunter type guardian who can use a main hand or off-hand pistol.  
---
Eh, worth a shot. Sorry it didn't help!
---
as someone who just came back a week ago after 2+ years off, I'm totally into it again. TONS of new content, mounts, and, if life or professional commitments are in your way, the game is also "easier" and much less grindy, so it's easy to have fun and accomplish things in a short amount of time.
---
Thanks! I still have to get my PC looked at by a proffesional as well. 
---
I just finished building it like on saturday and its pretty good. Cool 30-40C degrees when playing on very high on numerous games such as Gw2, rainbow six, Rust, and dayz
---
Honestly. Being able to play these games and at 60+frames feels amazing
---
Agreed, I think they need to really teach players how to use soft/hard CC as well. They could try and revamp the story bosses/enemies (Zhaitan as well maybe?) with breakbars, telegraphed attacks include AoE spam, and toss in some raid-esque mechanics (do X to remove Y, or do X to not get damaged by Y). 
---
We'd see a lot more skilled players if that happened. It wouldn't need to be super hard either, just something the player can respond and adapt to.
---
Cool af 
---
You're right, it usually isn't... I wonder what they will come up with. I kinda like the idea of defeating Primordus last. Maybe we will find a way to pit him against Jormag and only Jormag dies, while Primordus is wounded... and we then retain Jormag's power until we can kill Kralkatorrik later, perhaps with another dragon as a vessel for Jormag's magic? 
---
Any why isn't breakbar damage visible in the tooltip? Why do I have to go to the wiki to know how much each cc does to a breakbar? Honestly mind boggling. 
---
As a fellow necro, sure :) can hit you up in-game sometime. Got any questions to ask?
---
Same here. I was definitely on the fence after I saw the first trailer and my initial impression is that it was kinda meh.
---
After this I'm completely convinced and it's one of my favorite legendary designs. I wouldn't even agree with most people that it's too simple as it's looks pretty flashy to me.
---
It will be my 6th legendary after Nevermore, Astralaria, Flames of War, Aurora and Warbringer. I'm glad I already have all the mats to insta craft it tomorrow.
---
They’re in Istan to farm memes not gold.

I have an AMD RX 580 and I'm getting like 40 fps on average with 8GB of RAM. Is that normal? Ryzen 5 2600 CPU.

Just because you don't like it doesn't really impact people who do like it enough to craft it.  So enjoy your haughty opinion.

It's best not to hype yourself.  Unless you are already a happy and content player, you will only just hype yourself and then complain how they failed at making an underwater campaign, if they even do.
---
Trying to begin Episode 1 :P
---
I think Riannoc would work fine, since he's a character that's dead at the beginning of the story, and the first time you hear about him is in the context of his death. No new player will know enough to go "gasp, I love that character! he *dies!???"*
---
No Amazon either?
---
Model quality low, model limit low, reflections  terrain or off, shadows low/med, post processing off and use reshade/gw2hook for better post processing. Rest can be max I think.
---
I personally like this **a lot** and would love to have the short bow version of this for my 'permafrosty' thief.

---
You only get rewards when you're on the map once it ticks. And while you're on the map your participation declines like it did before the change. (10 Minute for a kill/camp, 5 for a sentry etc.).
---
It doesn't go down if you are offline or online doing anything but wvw.
---
So if you don't care about your server at all and dont need/want the extra pips (since you will lose outnumbered) you could just do stuff for 4:30 minutes, log in to the map, grab the rewards and leave the map. I think that would be the worst way to abuse the "new" system. But I mean.. I'd just play WvW for that time then. Cap some, maybe join a Com..
---
The best thing about it really comes down to "you dont need to build up participation". You might now play wvw for a couple of minutes, still get t6 rewards and not feel like it wasn't worth it. And also you don't need to afk at the end because otherwise it would feel like wasted participation.
---
Sadly, if you can't play it right away (same day and within hours), it's best to not visit reddit and play without chat.  Many people will observe spoilers (yay!), but others don't care.  
---
But it's nice to give a reminder anyway for those who do care. :)
---
Indeed, sometime people forget that less is more. I definitely prefer this to shooting snakes and tigers.
---
Condi Berserker utilizes LB, though I'm not sure how meta it is anymore.
---
Can't find it either but at 11:56 you can see that in his demo build at least the new fractal is at lvl 78 in T4. So I guess it's unlikely to be CM (as it probably would have been at 98 instead).
---
There's always the option to just get the home instance node and let the currency casually build up over the course of a few months. It's not like there's any need to rush the collection, unless you really want to.
---
I have played mmos and experienced grinds. It's exhausting to think about "having" to login to get a reward. 
---
It also takes longer then 20 seconds for people without ssd. I have one and its still annoying (have alt acc for login farms)
---
some buy-outs started - superior sigil of speed, rune of pack\^\^
---
Once in GW1. I don't think Glint's Challenge was in her lair, and it had Shiverpeak dungeon aesthetics.
---
But if we go that route, visited three, soon four, times over the course of 14 years (or 11 storylines).
---
Might as well complain we're in Tyria (world) still.
---
Where do you buy HoT? That just takes me to PoF.
---
Ele spec with longbow or rifle- basically, a weapon with 1200+ range. 
---
Since it is a ring, I'd like to imagine it's a floating bracelet around the player's wrist instead of being held.
---
Dont play it. Im trying to quit, lots of my friends quitted or hiatus already.
---
The self-style hair kit includes all the same exclusive hairstyles as the total makeover kit.
---
mistonium is easy, just farm those "time bubble" dynamic events, they reward once per character per day, there are 5 of those events that spawn continuously. Think you get 5 per event, and you can complete 4-5 in 10 minutes or so then just switch character.
---
I try to avoid LA as much as possible. I hope they bomb it out of the game.
---
Well I’d like to see the current ones get balanced first, but I’d like to see a official support spec for engi (not just one that happens to be synergistic with the core spec)
---
lol that could be hilarious- punching someone with an hourglass, or a book, or a chalice, or a fan... it's so hilariously impractical!
---
Mesmer power spec with daggers. Instead of having 3 clones acting like resource and distraction, Have one doppelganger that the mesmer has some limited control over and can deal reasonable damage.
---
Kinda disappointed that the sword is a straight sword not curved
---
I cannot unsee!!!!!
---
Wut?
---
48 hours until Episode 5 is playable 
---
surely this is not the answer... I agree though. We have had a string of uninspiring legendarys this generation. 
---
I mean, you’re not entirely wrong ? If we hadn’t gotten so many over the top flashy skins over the years, this would definitely be a more unique legendary. Heck, I’d say it would have been considered pretty flashy if it had existed at the lau
---
I play gw2 and warframe a lot.
---
Gw2 struggles at about 30-40 fps on medium settings with some on low.
---
Warframe rarely drops below 120 on max settings.
---
This is on a 970. How can gw2 be so poorly optimised in comparison, *warframe is prettier!*
---
Can you provide a list of bows with pointy bits around the handle?
---
Legendaries also have unique sounds/projectiles and other stuff like statswap/sigilswap.
---
Dont like it? -&gt;  Dont craft it.
---
Oh jesus, shut up.
---
Every time the camera pans you lose all the detail, all of it.
---
When hobbit came out in 60fps people lost their minds over it and called it nauseating, it was one of the best visual experiences I'd seen in a movie just because of that.
---
Now, due to the terrible response, we're gonna be stuck at 24/30 for so long. 
---
The community is always going to be really divided with whether or not instabilities are fun or not.  I like having some variation in my daily runs, but one of the problems with instabilities is that their difficulty varies directly with group skill.  If you're running with a weaker or a less optimized group with longer phases then instabilities will make things both more frustrating and more annoying whereas with a stronger group or one that takes care to strategize for specific instabilities you'll barely notice them. 
---
Isn't it enough to not click all the "preview" posts?
---
Well you can make 600 gold in 1h30 in PvP.
---
loool
---
Launch game executable with -maploadinfo parameter and look at IP addresses (AddressCurrent) you're encountering crashes - maybe you're being blocked somewhere
---
Correct. Any footage of cheaters, exploiters, etc should just go straight to the exploits email address. Not much we can do on reddit other than go "rabble rabble yell" which isn't productive :) 
---
ONLY SOMEWHAT????
---
Am I too late?
---
Why does this weird random German youtuber get access to the new patch early and nobody else? lmao
---
It doesn't really matter because leveling in GW2 is a joke.  Just pick skills or weapons that scale well with power.  Nothing requires you do to decent or even semi-competent amounts of damage unless you want to solo champions and even then that's more dependent on learning their attack patterns and staying out of harms way.   
---
* Guardian - GS/Scepter-Focus. 
---
* Revenant - Sword/Sword/Hammer. 
---
* Warrior - Axe/X + GS
---
* Engineer - Bomb/Grenade Kit, Rifle. 
---
* Thief - Dagger/X + Shortbow. 
---
* Ranger - GS + Sword/Axe or Sword/Warhorn. 
---
* Mesmer - Sword/Sword + GS
---
* Elementalist - Staff, Dagger, Scepter etc. 
---
* Necromancer - Dagger/WH + Staff. 
---
That's how all legendaries work though. If it's a projectile it will be changed regardless of its shiny animations. 
---
In no particular order:
---
Elementalist: No weapon, DPS. The Forgemaster. Instead of gaining a new weapon, this Elementalist specializes in conjures both old and new. Conjured weapons mirror the currently active weapons, but float behind/around the elementalist attacking. Attunement swapping is replaced by new skills that allow you to take direct control over your conjures with 5 new attack skills. Fifth attunement slot reverts you to your normal skills and returns conjures to AI control.
---
Necromancer: Focus main-hand, DPS. The Conduit. The Conduit sacrifices most damage from itself in order to bridge the divide between our world and the next, summoning monstrosities. Once (and only once) the Conduit has built 100% life force, it can summon a rift and call out devastating creatures. The Conduit can directly possess their creations, but only by maintaining a channel, otherwise their creations are AI controlled.
---
Mesmer: Dagger main-hand, support via barrier application and aggro-swapping. The Jester. Uses tricks and deception to get the enemy to attack the wrong targets or have their attacks miss entirely. With a channeled skill, the Jester can force enemies to fixate on themselves or cause the next attack to rebound on the user.
---
Thief: Scepter mainhand, Support via damage amplification. The Mob. The Thief gains control of their criminal enterprise allowing them to summon powerful members of their gang. Utility skills spawn gang members to engage the enemy or help allies. Scepter skills do low damage, but mark enemies hit by them for strong unique debuffs that amplify the damage they take from the thief's gang or other players.
---
Engineer: Staff, support via damage absorbtion and alacrity. The Neuromancer. Uses tech to latch onto allies and enemies' minds and control their senses. With allies, the Neuromancer reduces incoming damage drastically and redirects the remaining damage to itself, allowing it to build incredibly tanky and focus on self-sustain. For enemies, the Neuromancer can change allegiances of any enemy under champion level and make them attack their former comrades. In addition, the Neuromancer specializes in applying confusion and slow to enemies and alacrity to allies (manipulating their sense of the passage of time similar to chronomancers, except cooler).
---
Ranger: Offhand Pistol, DPS/CC. The Duelist. The Ranger uses their tracking and survival instincts to find and trap their opponent. Specializes in revealing stealth as well as uniquely being able to hit opponents during evade frames.
---
Warrior: Offhand Mace, DPS. The Brute. The Warrior learns to power through most obstacles, including the fear of death to become a rampaging killing machine. Adrenaline becomes a second health bar akin to Death Shroud and the  Brute specializes on pumping out stability for itself to always be able to close the gap with opponents. (Should be called Berserker, but ANet decided that should go to a guy with a stupid torch that can... do a second adrenaline attack? Woooo....)
---
Revenant: Torch mainhand, Support via arena manipulation. The Mist-shaper. Breathing the fabric of the Mists, the Mist-shaper's skills focus on creating barriers the enemy cannot cross or fire out of to deny areas or force enemies to path around them. Barriers last a long time. Intended playstyle is to place your barriers early and then swap to another supportive legend like Jalis or Ventari to fully support as the battle continues.
---
Guardian: Rifle, DPS. The Demonhunter. The Guardian's channels its fervor into hunting the worst scum of Tyria. Its utility skills have the Demonhunter call upon (racially-specific) heroes to bless the Demonhunter's weapon with different effects (for example, humans might call on Melandru to alter weapon skills to heal). This would effect any weapon skills, not simply rifle skills, and would act like Sharpening Stone for Rangers, in that the next X attacks would carry this enchantment before returning to normal.
---
you can rally off them, which saves some pulls
---
It's more likely that someone accidentally nuked/corrupted the map or some server died and they had insufficient/broken backups, rather than it never being saved or intentionally deleted.
---
Having a top streamer approving cheaters feels kinda dirty. Sad.
---
you forgot about the stormbow Kappa
---
Only if they get rid of that stupid rule that Guild Halls can't have things like a TP because they don't want to replace cities. VIP areas already do this.
---
Old LA isn't worth it without a TP or all the old NPCs still around and that's something guild halls do poorly.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
I use shield exclusively on chrono. 
---
Nah, I want the exact opposite. Let's get a Ranger spec that gets rid of pets completely!
---
If you are getting a new CPU in all likelihood you'll be building a new PC since new CPUs would need a new motherboard if the socket is different.
---
Nevermore shots ravens tho 
---
What is a non-insulting amount to tip a mesmer who portals the daily JP for you? Don't want to tip so much that it's worth more than the loot, but not something that would make them feel like opening the mail was a waste of time.
---
i used to think that was legendary only since only the kudzu (and maybe time keeper) has an arrow on it. but disappointed that pharus don't have it. 
---
Lol at Anets 'never grind' bullshit. The whole damn game is a grind. Oh, you want something? Just do this thing literally 500 times and its yours. Ascended weapons? Just go chop down 10000 trees and you got it.
---
The whole game is a fucking grind fest.
---
Did this for season 2 and three when I returned with 'head of the snake'.
---
It's not too bad. They are relatively cheap :)
---
Zerg gameplay is not fun. The only maps that do it right are Silverwastes, Tangled Depths, and Dragon's Stand. The only reason they feel good is because of everyone having different jobs for the majority of the content. Things like Istan and champion farms....ugh. It is just 100 people moving as a single unit. AB is okay as far as zergs go, just not fun at all to play.
---
A support tank to surpass chronomancer
---
Or fucking dark knight 
---
I hope it's really underwhelming just because of this fact and I like chaos
---
Idk why but this video makes me enjoy the look of the bow more than I did.
---
Gunslinger, dual pistols for AT LEAST one profession. Maybe Warrior.  Longbow for ele, or as runner up choices, pistols or greatswords. 
---
My thinking was something along these lines:
---
Elementlist - Longbow
---
Ranger - Focus
---
Revenant - Scepter
---
Engineer - Staff
---
Warrior - Pistols 
---
Guardian - Warhorn
---
Thief - Greatsword
---
Necromancer - Hammer
---
Mesmer - Mace
---
Alright so let me get this clear - all i want is learn content by playing it without spending hours watching tutorials, wait days to find training guild that willing to waste time on me with no benefits to them, and deal with all elitist bullshit from 16years old kiddos. Lfg should allow anyone to join group, i believe there is a system implemented in wow. If someone wants 500li requirements, pls go ahead and create private squad within guild etc. 
---
Nay, not even the right colors
---
Ah I'm a bit of a newb when it comes to Path of Fire content - I just got back into the game and I didn't realise beastmode was a permanent effect, I thought it was an elite skill.
---
I disagree, Glint died within the lifespan of the members of Destiny's Edge. If she can be an Elite spec, Trahearne can as well, especially considering how special he was to the Sylvari and his roles in taking down not one, but two elder dragons
---
Only problem is they are 'unique' so you can't double up on those earrings or rings on the same character.
---
The settings you need to turn down depends on your hardware. Some settings puts more stress on CPU while others use more of the GPU. 
---
Some graphic effects just needs your GPU to have a whole bunch of CUDA-cores.
---
Based on what you toggle down I'm guessing your setup is 5-7 years old
---
Thanks, that's great to know. One last thing, is the GW2 community about as active as it was say a year ago or is the game on the decline?
---
yes because they are tying stat combinations to volatile magic. ireno stated that we'll be seeing more support gear in the future that will make us (quote) want to not invest any money in new support gear now. my guess is that the new, predictably superior support gear sets, will be VM tied like plageudoctors and seraphs. 
---
UM was easier to gather and also less significant 
---
Wow didn't know about that. Also do you recommend getting both expansions at once or can I PvP/WvW just fine with 1 of the expansions?
---
Buy cheap low level off the TP. It's basically free and gives you a small exp boost.
---
Most of your xp will come from doing events. You don't need to do hearts, or map complete, and honestly I think the rewards to them while not horrible isn't worth frustrating yourself over. The best is when an event is near a heart-- chances you can double dip and the event helps you complete the heart. You also get a tiny bit of xp for doing dailies but again, don't stress out over them.
---
If it's still too much of a bother, then remember  Tomes of Knowledge come with login rewards. This makes it so it's not a matter of if but when you'll hit level 80.
---
No need for rushing but if yu really are interested :
---
- Map events
---
- Dungeons
---
- Story
---
- Hearts
---
Do Story whenever a new chapter becomes unlocked, so it should be every few levels.
---
Yur mainly gonna be hunting down Map Events and Renown Hearts.
---
Dungeons can be spammed provided yu find a group.
---
Awakened invasion events also yield alot of xp.
---
Basically yes.
---
There are some things that are obtained by story.. For example gliding... But before the expansions the game was just as fun. If you intend to be a casual player this is a great game. And the story isn't super long and drawn out either.. It's not good in my opinion, but one can get it done over a few weekends.. a few hours at a time all while still enjoying PvE/PvP and WvW. 
---
Piggybacking on this.. Find a good guild. They will help you find direction in game and there are many guides on classes/professions. 
---
Royal terrace is quite close to where it loads in.
---
PvP is structured and balanced. You PvP with a lvl 2 character and are automaticallyed boosted to lvl 80 (max) with all Skills and Specializations (Passives) unlocked. You also get a complete set of all Stat Builds via "Amulets" and all Runes/Sigils (cards in R). Head to metabattle.com copy a build and enjoy the killing.
---
GW2 has zero grind. It's designed that you can do anything at any time. Want to kill monsters? Go ahead. Just explore stuff. Perfectly fine and exploring new areas and finding hidden Vista spots also give XP. Our "quests" are called Hearts, but you don't need to sign up for them, they have about 3 ways to complete, and you can just skip them. Hearts aren't mandatory but just point ou in the correct direction. The biggest feature of the game are Meta Events. If you see Orange stuff on the map i.e. circles, arrows, crossed sword, it's an adventuer/quest going on right there and then. Help out and stay awhile since it might chain into another Meta event depending if it secedes or not.
---
The real game doesn't begin at 80. It begins at lvl 1. Ir's just at level 80 you can start on long term goals.
---
The only grind in GW2 is just for cosmetic items. Just go and do what you want when you want it. The world has lots of secrets and neat things to find. Just follow what interests you.
---
This might actually be good in pvp, weirdly - harder to see which shot to avoid because of the knockback trait.
---
I would just get both if you can. Half of the elite specializations are locked behind each expansion, so you get a lot more customization and a lot more options if you have both expansions
---
How many players are on a given screen in warframe?
---
Fair point, depends on priorities I suppose.
---
Condi Berserker is still extremely meta, especially in raids, and is alright in Fractals (though generally outshined by Power Zerker).
---
Mob hp is hidden, for example
---
I've read recently that this game is dated. I honestly think this game is still beautiful and holds up to today's standards.
---
Being able to pull off things like this is what makes world exploration really fun in a lot of games and you get a sense of achievement when you find a solution to a problem by yourself.
---
I always found it mildly annoying when people complain about how "hard" it is to get to things, or how they are "forced" to use different mounts or how it's bad design bla bla bla. Maybe I'm just paying more attention to it but I see a lot of these types of players in Crystal Oasis a lot.
---
I remember that.
---
It's definitely thing on laptops. Also if you use the Nvidia Gefore Experience to manage your game settings it might not recognize GW2-64.exe.
---
At one point it was granting the full AP to people who shouldn't have had it. Now it only shows up sometimes when gw1 and gw2 servers fail to communicate
---
Well I think a 100% hall of 50 pts is around the same difficulty... There is a lot of overlap in the titles 
---
Oh geeze, imagine being forced to use the Jade Wind to stop Steve/whoever the baddy is and inevitably causing a second petrifying wave through Cantha.
---
No idea how that would work in implementation but man.
---
i think its 4am 9th aedlst
---
What about making Rifle on Mesmer more like a strong sustained damage weapon, with bullets coming from all directions like Rev's Shortbow and making it a 1200 range with 1 or 2 600-900 range attacks to make it a solid mid-range weapon to poke down foes until you can finish them off with a small burst. 
---
This man Teapots.
---
Oh, hey, Teapot, btw bud, want to visit our discord server some time :D  Are you NA or EU? Or ... if you are on NA, come join our training discord and have a "curated" LFG experience if you will and find other players of similar skill level who won't harshly judge you and can provide advice about builds, rotations, boss strategies, etc.
---
Raiders in Training was created with the sole purpose of countering the exact complaints you listed above. I'm quite fond of your "overselling" of support scourge, as I've used it since the spec was released and its awesome to see it get some appreciation finally ;)

I manually maxed out my first character because I played on release. Subsequent characters have been used to fulfill roles I want to play in end game content and I don't bother grinding to 80 if I can avoid it. There will always be a learning curve for a new profession but I don't think there is any cost or benefit regarding grinding vs LVL 80 boost. I've played elementalist for years and I still learn new stuff!
---
Yes. I'm clocking in around 11000 hours now of GW2 on my Sager laptop. It runs GW2 fine and have very amble cooling, never overheated. 
---
I did replace the fans once as the bearings got old and I "repasted" the CPU and GPU with some mx4 paste to replace the default crap - something you might also do on a desktop.
---
But it's good for my use case.
---
Well then don’t read something that says “preview” in the future and not elect it to have some spoilers

I mean, Renegade is pretty much the GW2 answer to Ritualist.

I'm looking to start a support class, either a chrono, druid, or firebrand.  I hear there's supposed to be some major balancing patch tomorrow:  are people expecting large meta-shifting changes?
---
&gt; I am smart enough not to think myself smarter than a game dev and believing they are just stupid and lost the city because of that. There will be a good reason but since I don't work there, I do not know.
---
 More likely the old code simply doesn't run anymore. It references functions that don't exist. Therefore, trying to spin it up would just error unless you did some serious back coding. 
---
Thanks for the preview! It was probably not the best idea to show a light-themed weapon in a very bright environment like Lion's Arch though; the light effects for this one aren't as in-your-face as for other legendaries, so they would've probably been more noticeable on a darker background.
---
Happy cake day, too, I suppose!
---
There was a bug before Path of Fire came out where an extra PoI was added to Lion's Arch and if you got map completion again it would award you a cache as if you completed a PoF zone. That's my guess because I had credit for the cache without actually doing map completion due to that.
---
Fun fact, the rank names of the french wiki are based on the rank of the Priory for this reason.
---
(O_O)
---
Amazing job &lt;3
---
My point is you gain little by doing this yet affects your sleep (and health ever so slightly this one time), your whole day etc. 
---
Same as seeing a movie on opening day. What's the point? Crowds, lines. For what? 
---
But if it makes you that happy, do what makes you happy. That's the important part. 
---
If you're going for absolute cheapest, crafting the grandmasters marks and buying it in the fractals lobby works out cheaper, but you need the fractal research pages as well. 
---
Bless your soul this is perfect 
---
Obsidian Sanctum I'd say, you can access from any character (assuming the character is either level 60 or not from a f2p account and you have all the commodities you'll need (Bank, TP, Laurel, regular vendor).
---
 ugly af weapons. glad i dont like them so i dont have to farm anything 
---
How can you ?? Did the update is up ??
---
I already have all materials needed except materials for insignia :) so i want to craft it but not sure which stats should I craft... 
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/ascended
---
The cheapest ascended to craft is always going to be a recipe that uses a salvage insignia as those are cheaper to buy than crafting one.
---
IMO if you're going for a core stat combo just craft that directly as you aren't saving either money (have to make another insignia) or time. Expansion stat combos (mostly just the HoT ones) that require a bunch of special material to craft are the ones where stat swap will save a lot of time.
---
This, and it’s fun to experience everything for the first time with everyone when people still don’t have the answers to everything. I’d much rather do these quests, events, achievements, etc before dulfy brings out guides and everyone knows what’s going on. Basically it’s fun to play it blind with everyone else at peak time
---
For some reason I don’t mind spoilers. I mean watching someone else won’t stop me from playing. Anyways I love seeing funny girl gamers play, definitely gotta see more of ur videos. Btw ur greatsword is awesome where did u get it, plz don’t tell me it’s an legendary. 
---
If you boost your character to lvl 80 with booster what comes with expansions you will get the full exotic gear set for free, but it have defensive stats so not good for instanced content.
---
Otherwise, if you jump on one of the meta gold farms once you are lvl 80 you can make enough gold for another set with desired stats within an hour or two.
---
I tried to play on low graphics, i had less fps than on max graphincs
---
Someone already mentionned the Scepter with Ele skills this would also apply to Bifrost/Nevermore for A bunch of Weaver dual attacks: Pyroclastic Blast, Plasma Blast and Monsoon are where it's the most noticeable. You lose the base cool anymation of thos projectiles and get the legendary instead.
---
So it's not because this LB was rushed it's because all legendaries work exactly this way for the moment.
---
You can always make your own squads with absolutely 0 requirements. They fill pretty fast and you will meet more similat minded players. 
---
I believe people who invested (?) in Andy get an early preview of the game, sand the final instance.
---
To me, picking something to grind towards is kind of the essence of GW2. 
---
So, heads up, I guess? 
---
But yeah, there are situations where you can kit up a character the week you hit the level cap and possibly won't have to worry about their again again. 
---
&gt;  
---
Thank you :) now i get it ;)
---
There's a similar bug with HoT and Enguneer's Cache

Oh god. Can we talk about 'Birds'? That one looks hilarious.

The bunny’s weight doesn’t matter much if there’s a max-sized norn in heavy armor on its back
---
GWAMM was considerably more difficult, most of the HoM can be brute forced with gold
---
and the "title" category has a lot of partial titles requirements (like only Rank 4 out of 10 for luxons and kurzicks or rank 3 out of 10 glad) or merely completing something trivial like the story or uw/fow/urgoz/deep. While GWAMM requires max ranks titles (and ranks were often exponential in difficulty).
---
Super cool great sword

---
Shiro/Jalis is basically camp the superspeed (shiro) or the hammers (jalis) as you sleep on the sword auto attack, throwing in skills 2, 3, and 4 every so often.
---
Glint/X basically the same (if you picked shiro or jalis in the second slot) with the glint part of the legend swap being like ChmSteki said in their comment. Weapon rotation's the same. Sword autos, 2, 3, and 5 on cooldown.
---
Parts of ad infinitum? Or it's precursors
---
That title might be my favorite gw2 pun
---
Thats ad infinitum right? Nice HD
---
Happy you who can set your... settings high enough to see this. :)
---
Yu should be consuming Might Facet and Swiftness Facet on cooldown, then swapping to Shiro to use PT and Impossible Odds auto attack and repeating.
---
Yu should be using Glint heal situationally since it only gets most value when yur about to take a huge hit. Elite facet is only for on demand CC if yu need it. 
---
The ideal way to play is to blow Sword skills on while using Glint, then using primarily Auto and Sword 2 while in Shiro.
---
I may be hilariously wrong here, since I don't Herald much. 
---
Wikinception
---
Quite simple. the party just need to take time to read and... Sorry. "take time" + "read" ? Not gonna happen in t4. Pug's life will be so funny next few days. XD 
---
Thanks, that's exactly what I'm looking for.
---
FYI, start the newest expansion, turn off audio and dont read anything and after about 20 minutes you'll have the raptor mount (dont even need to finish the mission, just bail and go back to what youw ant to do).
---
Raptor mount makes getting places fun.
---
probably not
---
If it overheats like crazy, you might be thinking of conventional laptops misused for gaming, or badly designed ones. Properly designed gaming laptops rarely overheat.
---
I'm using a Clevo and wouldn't really change it for a desktop, even if I could get the same performance for a much cheaper price.
---
So I know that the expansion content starts after level 80 (right?). Does that mean that it doesn't have any benefit for me yet as a casual player who's highest level character is level 64?
---
Would it be good to pick it up now or just wait until I am level 80 and a sale after that?
---
considering I see like 40+ people a day running around with them, I’d say probably not
---
PSA: Can we talk about being the only one that has unpopular opinion? I just downloaded this game and community is awesome &lt;3 My girlfriend drew my cute asura main and we need to talk about my fashion wars [obscure image hosting link]

To be fair the shinyness of the LB is a bit deceptive, as that place in LA has the greatest amount of lightness among all other places I have seen in game, especially on morning.
---
is't that how Tybalt died?
---
Way ahead of you. I highly doubt it'll be done in time though
---
Anet partners get early access to patches in order to prepare content in advance. It seems like they have some sort of embargo on releasing anything that is lifted the day before the patch is due to go live.
---
For future if this happen again and you want to be somewere and have no access to it yet use the teleport to a friend. Ask a friend or in mapchat if someone can move to a spot you need to be at. Use the teleport to a friend and you will end up at the point were your friend stand. 
---
Sometimes friends are not a thing then go to the lfg-tool and the map you want to be on, join a squad that is there and use tp to a friend and you end up on top of the person you ported on. The latter is harder to do specific but for example i have account on NA were i do not interact with guilds or the like so if i want to get to a certain PoF map i often use teleport to a friend. Ofc you have to do the story one time for this (just saying this if anyone elese read)
---
I casually boosted my female charr and I need help in picking a server and expansion for her. Can we also have easy mode and legy armor for world bosses? 
---
Those who have access to the press version of the game can play the patch earlier to prepare their news report. It seems like yesterday was the end of the embargo on some of it. Thats why we see a lot of info right now.
---
Its from the press version. Not from the live game.
---
Consider you can type in chat /wiki text here. Already makes it canon to me
---
Also i remembered this that was posted last night https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/adjh8g/this_is_how_i_got_the_quicksand_mastery_without/

We have that, its called Soulbeast and is strong in PvP and PvE currently.

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Named_Mordant_weapons

Every mordant named weapon is harrier by default, or you can craft the normal mordant ones [after unlocking their rare counterpart first, thing that should be easy since they're pretty common and you can just buy all on tp]
---
You only need to pay once to get 2 expansions + base game, for the cost of 2 months Wow Playtime.
---
\+ Level and Gear is 'capped' (lv 80 max and ascended stats bests stats), which means if you stop playing for a while, and you come back, you still have the best tier gear and don't need to do catch up grind.
---
Completely deserved ! The people working on the wiki are doing an outstanding job.
---
I only hope they don't do a combination again, like twilight + sunrise = eternity. 
---
it's a new skin that you will be able to acquire by playing the new episode. it comes in exotic and ascended variety, difference being the pink glow effect i think. 
---
That’s the kind of legendary I love. I’ll definitely make it.

---
Well I already purchased the base game a long time ago, so I already have the daily login and such.
---
I think I'm gonna pick it up but not use any of the boosts, I don't think it should take too long until level 80 right?
---
Not anyone is Guts right ?
---
try&lt;3
---
I can do almost all but I had some stacks of revive orbs and teleports and such so they will ne missing 
---
Of course, I wouldn't want him to quit the game, but most of us old timers didn't have a level 80 boost, and we didn't quit the game.  I worry that boosting to level 80, and not know what to do might be more frustrating than leveling, and taking in the world.  He mentioned wanting to raid, and you wouldn't be ready to raid if you boosted to level 80.  I understand that mounts are nice to have, but again, we didn't have them till last year, so it's not like they're necessary.
---
 /mentor doesn't get as many as you think :P
---
Nonsense, of course he is the only one on the whole internet. He asked the "Am I the only one" question after all!
---
Honestly I'm just doing map completion. I know it's a grind. I have enough tomes if I wanted to skip. My goal however is all classes with 100% map completion. Not for rewards or anything. Two days ago my Engineer reached 100% Core Tyria. The day after I started my Guardian, he's currently at about 20% Core Tyria. Once I have all 9 classes with 100% Core Tyria. I cycle through them again. This time doing the LW zones. Once they have all the LW zones I cycle through again. Doing HoT zones. So on and so on. My aim is to eventually 100% every single map on every single character.
---
Why don't I get burnt out? Because the whole time I'm doing this. I'm either listening to a Podcast (Welcome to Nightvale/The Adventure Zone/Wolf 359) or I'm watching something on Netflix/Binge watching a Youtube Let's Play.
---
I think there was also a bug for a while that map completion counted for every unlocked specialization, no matter what character you did the PoF map completion on. At least I remember having like 6 "ClassX Cache" unlocks without having really played/map completed any of the elite specs I just unlocked with spare HoT points.
---
Between the two, the UM's got a bit faster animations, only from the standpoint that the VM tools have this god awfully long startup animation before it actually does anything.
---
The order of the storylines is correct :) there are living world seasons in between, so it goes like base&gt;lws1(not playable)&gt; lws2 &gt; HoT &gt; lws3 &gt; PoF &gt; lws4(current).
---
Note that you may need to purchase the living world episodes if you didn't login during their time of release (if you want to play them, else entirely skippable) btw if you login within next 6 hours you should be able to get the lws4 episode 4 for free if you haven't unlocked that yet. 
---
As for class suggestion, depends on your preference, what kind of gameplay do you want? Based on that people may be able to suggest. 
---
For class race combo, you can always look at some existing story characters for inspiration, like destiny's edge.
---
So ele would be an asura like zogga, rev would be a charr like rytlock, mesmer would be human female (for fashion wars) and like queen jennah and anise. Engi, I am not entirely sure but i have always considered Taimi to be an engi because of scruffy, so maybe asura? But IMO engi has always seemed more like a charr thing to me because they are the ones who keep developing and industrializing and stuff.
---
Exactly, just keep the original aesthetics with the ships and the wooden houses.
---
The new thing feels like a cheap Divinity's Reach.
---
i recommend  using the lvl 80 booster as a trial first. 
---
You do not instantly consume the booster, rather than send your new character in a lvl 80 pve map where you can play as a core lvl 80 profession without any limits.
---
This can be used on any amount of character,and i highly suggest you trying out all of the professions before deciding on which one you wish to spend your lv 80 booster on.
---
After you get to lvl 80 you skipped on exploring and leveling part of the game. You will also start off with 2 gold ,some items and a choice of a dye (check the wiki to see which dye form that pack is most expensive).
---
You will also start fully geared out with lvl 80 exotic gear (usually soldiers stats, which adds a great amount of power for raw dps, toughness for armor and vitality for health (but no precision for crit chance or ferocity for criticial damage, tho you can bump those with profession traits, utility skills and fury boon)
---
As a lvl 80 with exotic gear you can pretty much do anything you wish now.
---
* explore the core world for 100% map completion
---
* do world bosses in core world
---
* Farm silverwaste (the lv 80 booster trial zone) for gold,achievments and other gear)
---
* easy old 2012 dungeons for dungeon tokens for unique dungeon exotic armor and weapons
---
* t1 fractals,another much better quality and updated 5man content, to play higher tiers of fractals you will need ascendant gear and agony resistance infusions on them in order to survive. This is the ONLY part of the game where you actually need ascendent items in order to progress.
---
* You can play trough the personal core story about the elder dragon zhaitan.
---
* You can do a short recap of living world season 1
---
* You can buy season 2 and play trough it which ends in a cliffhanger right before HoT story line. (note this season offers only long story and achievements, no new maps)
---
* You can start the HoT story if you bought it
---
* Buying living world season 3 will give you new maps, new currency and achievements as well as ascendent trinkets for you to buy (which are special ones that can have their stats reset if you buy a item from one of the merchants,making those trinkets semi-legendary i guess)
---
* Or you can skip all of that and go directily into PoF expansion (if you bought it) and play trough its story ,and unlock and train mounts and mount masteries.
---
* If you have PoF unlocked you will also be able to buy living world season 4 and play those episodes, as well as play a new finale episode for free (if you log in and unlock it for free) . This episode should be released today.
---
Buying hot or pof offers some raids as well, but i highly recommend avoiding those if you are a freshly boosted character with soldiers gear....that wont work and you will have an unpleasant experience
---
Meta!
---
you still use it, its like 2018, get new stuff
---
No, you aren't alone. I love em but no money neither gold.
---
Blink and signet of inspiration (passive effect) are good for mobility. Mantra of pain and phantasmal disenchanter are good nukes. Majority of other skills don't have many uses for leveling.
---
As for specs take dueling, domination and illusions (I'd take them in that order). Pick all offensive traits in them to make things smoother.

It very much made sense to go there to destroy the dragonsblood spear too, though I can see how it might have felt out of place or contrived if you hadn't read the book or paid attention to the story.

you are limiting wrong settings

You can get both expansions for a total of 25€. It's a great deal.

It's like "Salvage all" You think you are fine, but then, you get it and it feels awesome. 
---
When I say "Slot" I mean a single build template which includes a set of equipment and skins, a skillbar and a set of traits. So basically, with 2 slots you can change between a set of equipment with zerker stats and another with, for example, condi stats.
---
I imagined that these slots could be bought just like crafting disciplines slots where you actually have 2 per character but you can buy an additional crafting discipline per character which is account bound.
---
In the case regarding your multiple profession scenario (2 different Guardians, for example) I think you should be able to share your Armory within your account, which means you would have 4 slots for those 2 guardians.
---
and they made so much bad stuff from gw1 better. so whats your point?
---
Best magic find boosts I could buy/get ? pls :d
---
Yea obviously bad but not because the cpu is bad but because the game is not optimized to run on multiple cores. I'm not gonna buy a 1000$ cpu with the best single thread performance just so i can play above 80fps on a game that is very old when i can buy a way cheaper one that performs insanely well on pretty much every other game.
---
The game is almost a decade long. GW1 had build templates and those provided a new depth to the game. People are asking for this for a long time. My bet is that this will be added soon, but my question is how?
---
3-4am but be aware that the patch isn't guaranteed to drop at that date in that shamans timer and there might be disconnects and crashes due to the sudden spike in load on the servers after a content release.
---
It's my first time participating in Secret Toymaker and I was really, really excited about it. The giving spirit and giving back to the community and doing a nice thing for someone. Well, when I signed up, I did know there were such risks so I tried not to be too hopeful about getting a gift. I'm still slightly disappointed, it puts a damper on the event and my mood but I'm also glad that my match asked for something simple. Send back 40g worth of mats they asked for instead. I'm still pretty happy about being able to give. :D I'll consider again at the end of this year if I wanna join again. 
---
The Wiki's article is pretty extensive on it: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic_Find
---
The recent patches did built foundations for templates, stone by stone, in possible preparation for it.
---
However my take on this is way different than yours. And I guess it is also more "wanted" way from Anet as well, as it boosts the economy demand...
---
The main part of build templates will be building around Legendary equipment, and the thing that you can swap for free all the things with it. There might be bag for runes and sigils maybe (something like material storage for like 30 runes each?) and on single click you just replace all runes in armor with the newly selected one, similar to PvP build gui. Wanna switch stats? Same story, one dropdown for switching whole equip at once. In theory having some slots to save certain stat/rune/sigil mixes across the equipment to switch back to. Another part would be build and skill memory for easy switching of whole builds (although this is already quite easy even now, you just *have to remember*).
---
I would add similar memory/switching to color/skins of armor. You would get limited amount of slots to save your combinations, once saved, you can switch between combinations for free, similarly as you can switch between outfit and non-outfit today. However getting those slots would cost one-time payment in transmutation charges, which would be fully justified in my opinion, if we really talk free swapping between skin templates (the another option is to pay transmutation charges per each change, which would be against using it en masse in my opinion. And you would still have to use charges first to get into the shape you want, before saving it).
---
I would not support automated switching of pieces of equipment, as having multiple copies clogs inventories compared to legendaries, and is way lower economy drive than pushing endgame people towards legendary equipment. Legendary equipment would get additional QoL usability, even though it is already pretty much dope to have one today - to have immunity towards meta changes, as you can just change as you like...
---
Took up a mesmer for my first toon and finding it fun. Been using scepter and pistol at first, later on changed to scepter and torch instead. Back bar used the staff, which is nice and pairs nicely early on with the Choas specialization. 
---
I love the boots and gloves, not too fond of the shoulders with the candles...
---
That's the exact image in my head and it's glorious. 
---
I'm afraid that 5 slots per account could be excessive - considering a general player demand. Also, if you offer 5 slots for free, players will not buy more slots and from the ANET perspective that's not profitable.
---
I had to check the wiki because I was sure Hammer was also remaining but Sharur is the hammer ... that thing is so bland that I totally forgot it existed.
---
Is that a result after your testicle pain after the long boarding? Asking for a friend
---
As much as I know this subreddit, this post will either get downvoted to hell or ignored into non-existence. ^^^^^This ^^^^^comment ^^^^^too.
---
What can I say. On one hand - this sucks and should never happen. On the other hand the more customers you have, the more you will try to cut corners by using automated banning and suspending instead of real people reviewing cases. This means popularity of GW2 will be the downfall of it's customer support - after all it's much cheaper to let bots see you as an player id number that can be banned for a slight suspicion, than use time of an employee to do a personal review. Then again - positive side of not scaling up customer support with amount of customers is that you can afford not having subscription fees. 
---
I'd totally be down with dual daggers as well. I like this take on a hex based spec with the health draining. I never really played GW1 so I didn't know some of the older Mesmer skillsets.
---
At least we can still visit GW1 LA tho.
---
&gt; because the game is not optimized to run on multiple cores
---
Where are you getting this from? subreddit urban legends? do you put different meaning in "optimized"? Look up dev explanation how game runs on threads, for more info.
---
Yes we can rephrase the statement "gw2 is bad for Ryzen 5 2600X cpu" but than you have to rephrase your original comment to "It's not like i have a bad game either: GW2."
---
I also like the PvP lobby one.
---
The WP is right next to it and there is a BL, Bank and a merchant all around it.
---
&gt; You have this perfect understanding of how the gaming world works 
---
[Expert's fallacy.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority)
---
&gt;If they don't want old Lion's Arch to be brought back, they could have just said it this way instead of spinning an elaborate answer to that issue.
---
We're talking about the same company that:
---
* Took years to admit they had abandoned dungeons.
---
* Pushed lootboxes and RNG mounts after months of silence while worried people were constantly asking what the business model would be.
---
* Stayed silent about raids, refusing to release any information on them, when there was a huge "where is the challenging content we were promised?" outrage going on.
---
* Took months to admit they were not going to release more legendary weapons collections.
---
And I could go on and on.
---
&gt;They're working people, you really think they like to waste their time on fabricating something like that?
---
That's your biggest mistake. Ever heard of PR departments? Employees can't speak freely about what's going on in their company.
---
Any room for a returning player in there? From the UK as well and will log in after 6ish but this time around I want to stick with the game and I'm hoping a good guild can help with that 
---
&gt; Sucks that these got a collection and the stellar weapons, which look good, did not.
---
I hope they eventually get one, even if it doesn't have any flashy rewards.
---
The preview says it's another trial/ challenge
---
You overestimate the number of people that view that content. The people that do tend to be heavily invested in the game, and most players aren't. The average player probably doesn't look at much GW2 content outside of the game.
---
Rumor was we would be getting a new mount as the "season reward" instead of a legendary trinket, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
I hope the next raid ends up giving a full set of jewelry instead of just one ring.
---
Different way to see build templates but I'm glad that there is a discussion around this! Thank You for your opinion!
---
Some thoughts around your point of view:
---
\- Why would you not allow people to spectate your items? Even for raid/fractals that could be useful for hardcore players.
---
\- Regarding the stats of the equipment, and considering PvE, how would you store a certain stat? For example, for a new level 80 player how would he add a zerk or condi stat to his "armory"? I see how that could be done with runes and sigils, but with stats I'm not visualizing it.
---
\- The usage of transmutation charges is indeed a good point!
---
There's no crazy oppressive hard cc heavy looking ranger weapon like hammer or mace, and also no one handed mid ranged condi weapon (not axe, since it doesn't condi on #1s)
---
Always. 
---
I don't get the point of tier-based skins. In another type of game, where you have to "level up" the gear or whatever, they would be fine, but here? No one's going to use them after unlocking the next tier, and it won't take long for that.
---
I would prefer if they focused on recolors instead of tiers. Scrap the downgraded exotic version, and give us cyan (Aurene) and yellow (Vlast) versions for the ascended weapons.
---
Well GW1 also had how many more skills to choose from? :)
---
No human. What is this witchcraft?
---
you misunderstood the concept: you had 2 slots for 400, i have 5. Five is a limit your alts have, but each professions has 5 unique ones. Your thief1 has 5 they are shared with your thief2, but your mesmer has 5 of its own.
---
I didn't mean to sound they are free, just come in packs of 5, like the shared slots 1is most expensive 3 is cheaper 5 the cheapest (400g); you may get 1 free slot as introduction.
---
Also if you truly want Build Templates, you probably have 10-15 builds...
---
NO GOD!! PLEASE NO!! NO, NOOOOO!!
---
How many Elite specs are we willing to have on GW2? :)
---
Pvp or pve?
---
If there aren't groups up that don't require KP, then make them. Or get some friends or guildies to do the content. It really isn't difficult.
---
She dislikes humans, sorry \^\^
---
&gt; How am i supposed to earn KP if i can't find group to do the content? xD
---
Fractals: Make your own group.
---
Raids: Join a raid training community, or know people who raid who can bring you into their groups (providing you know what you're doing, and the friend of yours also knows it)
---
I was hoping we would get 2 rings over a series of raids as equivalent to the legendary armor but I don't see this working now.  
---
Good idea on the mount to be honest.  Client side Aurene skin? Or would that dissapoint 
---
look for ppl taht are in the same situation like you and try to build a static group.
---
At this point I'd prefer Anet to spend their developer time on things like the promised wvw update and qol updates as we kind of have the funtionality in arcdps. Anet is a big company but they're spread thin among the all game modes and actually making money. Don't get me wrong I'd love to have build templates.
---
You get KP like everyone else got them: 
---
\- join a trainings group
---
\- join a trainings guild
---
\- open your own trainings group in the lfg
---
People with KP want to do the content in a decent time and dont want to explain the mechanics every time again.
---
I'll actually upvote not because I believe OP, I want to see what kind of shit storm it spawns.
---
Thanks all for the replies, that's a great help.
---
Charr really do give the best face and pose!
---
I too have uncontrollable teenage angst
---
Ok.
---
all hail the mighty deercharr
---
&gt; you could work your way for higher AP
---
That is why those old requirements were flawed. I was in dungeons on my low ap alt, had to convince them first, did carry; on the other hand you had 20000 AP people who never did dungeons before...
---
* And ofc. there is simple solution to your problem: **list a group with no ap or kp requirement.**
---
The edge
---
Sword main hand is really good and you should stick to it. Recommended off-hands are either focus (2nd best power damage and ability to pack monsters/give swiftness) or sword (best power damage).
---
For second set greatsword is fine but if you don't feel the need for a ranged set you can use the second offhand with sword instead.
---
Your priority hero points wise should first be to get the utilities you want to use. You are likely to target phantasmal disenchanter, signet of inspiration, mantra of pain, signet of the ether and blink first.
---
Once you have the utilities you feel like playing, do not hesitate to save points for when you'll have access to specializations : these give huge passive abilities that will make all the difference. I recommend going for illusions, dueling and domination as you level up.
---
Note that chaos and inspiration are both extremely strong and you might even prefer inspiration for its confort (easy condi cleanse) but you generally only need raw power for open world/story leveling.
---
Beyond those recommendations keep in mind that you will get everything anyway eventually so don't hesitate to experiment and try stuff in any order. I just really recommend always maxing a specialization by available spec slot as you level.
---
Are you still doing that? 
---
I don't know where this idea of no new expansion comes from. PoF also released 2 years after HoT but with a one year gap in between until LW3 began. Arena Net is perfectly within their releasewindow with 2 to 2.5 years between expansions. With the added bonus that we didn't had 1 year downtime between PoF and LW4.
---
And yes I know... With 2 living world in between expansions we are most likely way over 2 years if the release cycle of 2 to 3 months stays the same and LW5 also has 6 episodes. But see it as a possible way to give us more content at once when the expansion drops. And now they actually plan with this release schedule and not like LW3 to PoF, need to add a filler episode because the ex-pac was not ready in time.
---
We need more people like you. People who want to see the ~~game~~ world burn! Heralds of ~~Balthazar~~ change.
---
How the heck did you get those poses? 
---
How the heck did you get all the characters in the same space? 
---
 Is this Photoshopped? 
---
Either way this is cool! 
---
To everyone that is interested, you are all more then welcome to join us for some content, I will however not be online for a while as I'm travelling. I will be back after the 20th of januari so definetly shoot me a message if you see me online! 
---
What if there was CM, but without any different loot. Would you change your mind?
---
   
---
The only mission you are required to do is the first mission, right after you create your character. And if you want a mount, the first mission of the last expansion. After that, you can raise your level the way you want, like doing events, exploration, dungeons, PvP, WvW 
---
Go away, elitist.
---
&gt; This game is basically no gear treadmill,
---
Newslfash: This is part of Anet's philosophy since 2005, together with no monthly subscription.
---
Cheddeer?
---
Rifle Necro would be cool to see, with Shroud abilities that either enhance it's power or ensnares / weakens enemies.
---
Rifle inspiration comes from Katarina in Dungeon Siege 3... 
---
The weirdest example is Invisible Mushroom Spores, as sometimes you can tag into Treasure Mushroom event without having a mastery to even target and do damage to him.
---
This obviously sucks if this is true and maybe deserves a second look on Anets side. However I've personally grown really tired of posts about "undeserved" bans and how "heartless" this company is. Those bigger stories often end with a dev tuning in and saying that the ban was right. But reddit usually trusts ppl like you for no reason and they never learn...
---
Apart from being able to jump? Nah
---
Thanks for the info. 😄
---
Cuddly cats, or fearsome felines. Charr are awesome
---
 Lore wise, its physically impossible to channel Balthazar. Therefore he will never be a legend. 
---
I already got that one 😔
---
Thank you though 😄
---
You're being as stupid as he is.
---
🤔🤔🤔 interesting... I'll have to try that. Thanks! 😄
---
i love it for the sandals, they're perfect for lots of *desert-y* looks.
---
ot: what scythe skin is that?
---
Yes.
---
You're supposed to get the KP like most of the other people did aswell. By learning the fractals/raids with people on the same level of knowledge, not by leeching it from people who are way above.
---
What?
---
Mesmer was somewhat more focused on interrupting skills, which I was never very good at. But the Hex skills were rather fun, if you go to the GW1 wiki, look up Conjure Nightmare and it's lesser form of Conjure Phantasm and imagine them combined. It was evil.
---
GW1 had some really unique builds and Andy could take some inspiration from it for new specs for sure. 
---
&gt;Players falsely banned? happens everyday everywhere.
---
I'm not gonna go deep on this but let's just say you have no way of knowing this 
---
&gt;As sad and well written OP's story is
---
I don't think those are common traits for truthful posts. The golden rule of the internet is to treat everything as bullshit unless verifiable.
---
In this case I'm treating it like entertaining bullshit 
---
Thanks for your takeaway. Jalis definitely seems to be the stronger option in harder content, but I do like the speed Shiro gives you in open world. 
---
I'm definitely planning on making a renegade, but I figured I'd use my first hero points to play HoT with the spec it released with.
---
&gt; the whole toxic elitist mindset is far less prominent than many posts suggest
---
yea no, it's not..but it's highly unlikely somebody will join a training run and be toxic, it would take a special kind of douchebag to do that
---
however you will often see pseudo-elitism from entitled people that have an average grasp on the encounter but act like they are god's gift and are there to "carry"..these people you will meet very often in pugs
---
not sure if it falls on the umbrella term of toxicity but often you will meet people that: 
---
1)brag about being top dps while being only 1k higher while doing nothing else(their job is just dps anyway never revive, never backup any mechanic)
---
2)start pointless arguments about small things(i was told to "stfu if you're clueless" when i mistaken the number of boons removed by some trait)
---
3)the quite frequent "i already kills this boss, i'm here to carry you and unless you kick X and Y players i will leave..also you must do exactly what i say or again, i will leave"
---
**tl;dr** lots of toxicity, not real elitism more like pseudo but still
---
just spend your money on a Brazzers Premium account to relieve your tension..
---
Spectating items would just turn into even way bigger pile of toxicity and elitism than we already have. Nowadays people judge others by dps meter, that actually shows how one performed, but your idea to see items would mean that people would exclude other people even before they could show their value. For this case even "killproofs" is not ideal, but well...why not just add iLvl then and just kick all that don't have full points...it would ruin things even more. Even today there is too few recruits to sustain longterm gamemodes like raids, and the community is slowly declining, because there are artificial barriers for people to start playing them and learning something, thus replacing over time the inactives.
---
Also it would be in direct breach of terms that are for addons, so there is no way that they would add it themself.
---
You store certain stat as its name. But the point is that you have legendary equipment and you can choose ALL stats on it automatically, and at any time. That's it. You have all stats automatically by getting that equipment, you don't need to unlock anything. Yes, this would not work with exotics and ascendeds, but again - exotics are just one-time use things that you stick with for limited time, coincidentally in that same time you are not really invested into the game that much that you would even consider running X builds or roles, in my personal opinion. Nor you usually have resources to get more armors as well...
---
But if you really want to make item swapping easier, then I would rather consider flagging items as "favourite", similar as is in Colors tab. Thus you would have your "set" on top of your choices in equipment tab in hero panel, so you would not need to search for it across inventory. 
---
Still I feel that such swapping on daily basis is really a end-end-game thing that people start to actively do when their knowledge about game reaches quite high points. Thus I still feel that such automated system in the realm of legendaries would be pretty much apropriate, and it would also mean another nudge for many on this tier of knowledge to finally get those legendaries for even more convenience. Casual players won't care about legendaries, but they won't care about swapping as well. And adding juicy stuff for legendary equipment is not wrong in my opinion as well, as those items should really be making your game extraordinary...not by stats, but by added features like this.
---
Don't get me wrong, but hassling with items is always problematic (inventory full for example, then what? how you replace your 2 weapons with twohanded, when you can't put second weapon back into inventory?), while dealing with just stats is way easier and will still do the job. And you need limited sets of legendary equip - one per character, forever, not like with ascended, where people have even like 3-4 sets for each character...and complain about needing to have that much.
---
"or no game shit life shit so ez nothing to play" 
---
Hey, can anyone calm down a baby ? 
---
That's awesome but alot of work you must love your lady so much. Thanks for sharing 
---
So you want a free carry and then have the gall to bitch about kp/like groups.
---
There's probably not going to be a CM.  It's unfortunate, and I'm disappointed too, but let's just hope the fights are fun, 'kay?
---
People like you are the exact reason for such KP requirements.
---
If you can't even figure out how to find training groups, the content will probably be too hard for you, since you don't seem to be the brightest candle on the cake.
---
They do produce enough good stuff even without CMs. You should be at least hyped for instability rework, as that will exactly affect your beloved content and very possibly in a good way...
---
But who really cares about CMs? They are run even less than raids.
---
If you want to have some content to be focused, work on popularizing that content. There are guilds that do it for raids, that train people to get them into it. Are there for your CMs? Do you take new people and train them? Wouldn't be less skilled party member the **added challenge** you seek for, while it would help to make the number of people playing CMs grow? Because if there is enough players playing something, there is also the natural focus of devs to work with it more and please all those people. But why would they try to please few players at the end of their playerbase, while such actions would not guarantee the money to pay the bills?
---
All I can really say is keep hounding them, if they are going to close your tickets and aren’t willing to look at your tickets after all this time make them hear you. Demand to be moved to a senior customer service agent.
---
[You don't say?](https://media.giphy.com/media/AyN4Uh6vL6GLm/giphy.gif)
---
&gt;which class should I roll for my last slot? Rev/Mesmer/Engi/Ele?
---
That is asked a lot, perhaps more than any others question here. It's not a problem though but the answers are always the same. First of all what do you want to do? PvE roaming, fractals, raids? Do you prefer ranged or melee combat?  And do you have a level 80 boost?
---
Remember when decided to read up on each's specializations so that you know what you can get. For instance I really didn't want another melee but liked the idea of playing a Dead Eye. So for the first time I rolled a thief. Dead Eye isn't THAT great of a class but I still like messing around with it now and then and don't regret it. 
---
Lost for words. 
---
I'm seriously wondering how you think new content gets cleared when it releases. Everyone waits till a experienced player is born that explains everything to the other 4 players, these 5 spread out to 5 new groups and so on?
---
And no it's not much better to join exp groups because he won't get a single clue how bosses work. You learn them by wiping on them, seeing the mechanics, learning what to do step by step, not by oneshotting and phasebursting everything into a DPS-golem.
---
&gt; And dont start bs about carrying 
---
? 
---
&gt;I'm not gonna go deep on this but let's just say you have no way of knowing it.
---
Neither do you, so noboday knows again. Touche
---
Well don't play the game simple Anet set out to make an MMO that you can play for a few days stop playing then come back without any consequences if you don't like it this isn't the game for you.
---
Jup, people were just shit players, because anet prohibited use of tools to be better, aka dps meter. After dps meter, and semi holy trinity was itroduced with HoT, community grew in skill on average, also average gear/build settup is probably better now on average, because before, everyone could slack in soldier gear and nobody could point fingers with hard evidence without asking to ping gear and stuff like that.
---
The game was never hard, that is why people 1 finger soloed Lupicus the hardest boss at the time. People were just very bad players on average and anet liked that. It was the hardcore community doing raids which pushed anet to allow dps meters and introduce golem area, to test dps with buffs and boons. It was few players which risked their accounts by posting videos with sick dps on the meter which was a perma ban offense at the time.
---
The fact is that hardcore players are leaving the game with rapid rate and shit wow xpacks wont magically fix that. Every MMO game has to have a healty balance of hardcore and casual players in order for economy and more important community strcutrue to function. The game is currently headed towards becoming a new penguine club with 99%+ of casual players. This is when game is broken and is entering the late stage of product cycle, where company just wants to spend as little as possible and sucks as much as possible. Did you notice decreased in new content, while gem store has more and more new stuff to buy all the time. I really wish this is not the case, but I see majorty of players are blind as fuck and will let this game die out. Today, not screaming for something means there will be nothing. I am screaming, scream with me...
---
You don't threaten what you love. What is wrong with you? 
---
&gt;I made a New Years' resolution to stop bottling up my feelings. And I made a promise to my deceased friend yesterday when I visited his grave that I would share my story.
---
Your story... about a video game...
---
You know... when people try use things like a death happening or emotional states like depression as a leverage to gain support... I tend to distrust and believe it's just a "hey, look at me!"
---
No disrespect to your friend.
---
Thank you for the sacrifice, I don’t really care about map stuff but I want to be able to see the story for myself.
---
I deleted that part because I realized you were leaving out the non cm fractals.
---
Some experienced players host training runs. Most don't. Some participate in groups with KP requirements because they want to finish in the most efficient and least stressful way possible. You can't force experienced players to accept players with insufficient KP in their groups, even if the latter will benefit. The two camps have diametrically-opposed interests which are equally valid.
---
&gt;Arena net should at least give out warnings before doing this.
---
There are warning in the ToS.
---
It is of course also worth pointing out that it would literally be pointless to have these things if they warned about adding these things, since that just means that botters and cheaters would stop for a while and thus not get caught. 
---
&gt;Touche
---
You made a claim you can't back up, I didn't.
---
:big_think:
---
As someone who has spent many years playing traditional MMOs, I've never understood the appeal of vertical progression; the gear treadmill. 
---
You get better gear, so you can do harder content. You do harder content, so you can get better gear. It's a vicious cycle. You're not progressing, you're keeping up. Big difference. 
---
Plus systems with vertical progression usually devalues skill, to a degree. Especially in PvP settings, where those who have sunk the most time into it are gods among mere mortals, when compared to freshly level-capped characters. Even if that freshly capped character is piloted by someone who has great skill. 
---
Oh yeah Raiding is also way different in its approach than open world content. Raiding is about sustained DPS in most encounters since the fight take minutes. In open world content you probably want to go for burst damage since most things die in seconds. Shiro is probably better for that.
---
I think the comment by u/Getoffmylawndumbass was sarcastic.
---
Depending on how hard the JP is it ranges from a thanks to 1 gold. Chalice of Tears garners more as you need a "guide" to run your through it. Map train commanders also get 1 gold, but I always figure others from the zerg toss them some as well. To be honest doing a HOT HP run is well worth a donation.  
---
I know.
---
I stated what I did because I wanted them to actually think about what they were saying.
---
hmmm
---
Power herald does not exist on snowcrows anymore. Reason being: weak, you can play it but it will never ever be optimal anywhere.
---
I was with you all the way until you write that you need a learning group in fractals. I mean like, what? Fractals is not that hard and the tier 1-3 is the learning group. You do not need training groups for fractals. It is terrible to make it sound like fractals are harder then they really are. I mean we did fractals for years without chrono, druids and dps meters and it went perfectly fine :)
---
Uhhh
---
Why so serious?
---
Good luck getting people to do it with you, without rewards. 
---
Whether we like to admit or not, the rewards are actually a fairly significant reason people do repeatable content. If 99CM and 100CM had no rewards: *why do it over the regular fractal?*
---
This is the same reason you don't get people repeating raid CMs often, if at all, since doing it again doesn't give the additional rewards the first time gave. Why do the CM when you could do the normal mode for the same rewards you'd get? 
---
Jep, I never req large amount of KPs, because my philosophy is that better players have to help players with less experience in order to achieve higher average skill rate of all players so we can all enjoy the game better and find groups faster, have higher kill rate and also maybe consider alternative comps to spice up. Right now you have to wait for 30 mins sometimes if you are not a druid or chrono player. 
---
I am hyped about them, but historically looking, they will probably suck ass so i try to keep my expectations low as I am almost over this game right now, which I dont wish to be the case.
---
Those barely count I'd say. Most of them are either reduced healing or do it in X minutes, the latter being very generous. 
---
Okay.  Then have fun.  You don't have to clear every day.  
---
Lol. Doing nothing while you see the game is dying is wrong. I dont know how your friend list looks like, but my is grey, because everyone already quitted the game, you know, nothing to do and stuff.
---
We got a new mount in Episode 3 already.  An Aurene griffon skin for completing all achievements on all 6 maps would be a fair reward though.
---
U need to dial up that "skepticism" within you. OP is using a "dead friend" as a leverage to get unbanned. That's low.... And not mention, he was caught cheating by Anet. OP's credibility is low.
---
That was never a real CM difficulty, it just called like that.
---
In my opinion, the better raiders are the ones who actually put in the time and have gone through the wiping and learning process. The problem with throwing new players in experienced groups to learn is that, later on, if something bad happens it will usually result in a wipe. This is because, through them "getting carried" week after week (essentially only knowing what happens when the fight is going well), they don't know what to do when things go wrong. Compare that to players, who learned the bosses by wiping for hours (maybe even days or weeks), where if someone makes a mistake then people have a much better idea of what to do to save the run.
---
How do you think things went when wing 1 was first released? Sure, back then there were significantly more players new to raiding in gw2 (literally everyone). The thing is, there are still more than enough new people to make groups because it's not uncommon to see threads like this at all.
---
I play on EU and often see training groups in the LFG and I have respect for these guys to keep at it and continue trying because that's literally what I and many other raiders did way back when wing 1 released. Heck I'll sometimes join them and help them out.
---
I've taken new players along to my static before and my experience with bringing a new player to, for example, Dhuum has been that they died to the 1st soul split and then got carried with the remaining 9 man. They gain their kp and learn literally nothing like that.
---
If you don't mind, I'd like to hear your thoughts as to why you think it's better for a low experience player to join an experienced group.
---
However I should also add that a Balance update today, which may switch things up a bit, so you might want to wait a few days before deciding what you wanna go with. 
---
Mystic Forge. 
---
Oh yea...
---
If ANet fucks up the first reaction will be "give them a break, they are trying their best".
---
If player has problems with ANet support first reaction is "he is lying, ignore him everyone!".
---
I do not care if his sob story is real or not, but if he was accused of using a cheat-app, he should at least have been informed which app caused this verdict (but after he asked for it, not before). If using for example adBlock on firefox caused my ANet account to be suspended I would be mad as hell, so I understand his reasons to use any argument he has. 
---
But hey, if it didn't happened to you, it didn't happen, right? 
---
&gt;Dungeons
---
Dungeons have never had their difficulty adjusted since the game's launch, so they're incredibly easy now.  Any classes are fine in dungeons.
---
&gt;Fractals
---
Only high tier fractals really care about the meta.  Once you get to T4 fractals, then most parties want a **healing druid** (Ranger spec) and 4 DPS.  Most parties don't care about which DPS, although some prefer to have a **Chronomancer** and/or a **Warrior/Berserker** 
---
&gt;Raids
---
In raids, the holy trinity is **Chronomancer** (Most groups bring two per boss), **Warrior/Berserker** (Each boss favors one or the other), and **Healing/Condi Druid.**
---
Always play during the season. I made around 200g in 3 weeks. Btw don’t play during the last week there is a chance your score will tank and make hard to complete chest when you’re always losing. 
---
I'm not actually the biggest fan of Sword/Sword for levelling; it's a good amount of damage, but I think Focus is indispensible. Stand in your warden's whirling defense to negate all incoming projectiles, and consider Feedback for your first utility; core mesmer can do absurd amounts of damage with well time reflects.
---
I hope it's a fishing rod. I can think of nothing more perfect.
---
Oh my yes the mounts are one of my favorite things about this game, and I was one of those vet gw players who were iffy about them.
---
 I would say WoW could stand to learn from Anet about them but I highly doubt this style of mount would work with the system(or be received well by the community)
---
I've made the experience that after a specific point (400Li) runs start to get worse again. Some ppl are convinced they are pros, stuck in their thinking but are still lacking something.
---
Best runs in lfg I've had was when asking 250. Some well phrased "no li-requirement" grps can also work.
---
My advise would be: *Close this chapter* (of your gaming life). Permanently.
---
Over the past few years of GW2, quality has nosedived anyhow. The game is still tremendous fun, but it didn't realize the absolutely massive potential it had at release. Assuming the monthly cost isn't of concern, try FF14 maybe. Or maybe like me you turn away from MMOs entirely, nowadays I fill time between my huge backlog of games with casual multiplayer experiences such as Overwatch, Heroes of the Storm or a lot of actual board gaming :o
---
You can directly convert them into gold. What do you mean they have no use? Just because you aren’t willing to make use of them doesn’t mean they’re useless. 
---
I agree with /u/Guildwars1996 (even if his nicnkame looks like ANet spy) that we do not need more sinks for currency. We need sinks for account bound materials that have no use, like airship oil for example. 
---
I feel like those are more like bonus vendors. They don't use up the currencies in any meaningful way/amount. 
---
I feel like this is one of those things that would be nice to have but would rather anet spend their limited time on more important things 
---
Already in the plans - going to be a very important feature! 😁 https://trello.com/c/iD3An5BP/21-external-module-support

Hey dude, if you really did get falsly banned I wish you all the best getting unbanned, but anything in your post to do with your friends death or your mental state is absolutely not relevant at all and makes it seem like your trying to manipulate people's heartstrings to get unbanned
---
It stays put. It's supposed to look like that "light from the heavens" draw effect is scorching the ground you are standing on.
---
True but aren't there much better sinks for Unbound magic for example? 
---
Oh wow, your realized that just now that Anet might be working on sth else? Teach me senpai.  
---
Aside from that "no gear treadmill" was always the philosophy.  
---
And not spending money on a game? Wow, revolutionary choice
---
^^^POLEARMS!!!
---
Love the Neuromancer and Demonhunter ideas!
---
It depends on what you enjoy doing in game. Today is a new patch, if you like pve content then maybe ask around in the new zone where people will be sure to be.
---
If you like wvw then check there.
---
Needs to end with "Change My Mind"
---
&gt; I still don't know which of my programs was being detected as UNF.
---
I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that it was probably UNF.
---
We go to Glints lair to destroy a spear Balth wants to use to kill Kralk, but after defeating Balth and empowering Kralk in the process, we now go back to a mists version of Glints lair so we can reforge the spear and kill Kralk.... that we had to go through Balth to prevent in the first place. Hmmmmmmmmm
---
Darr
---
[Fluff]
---
Haha
---
I do agree with anets decision of giving exo solder gear on some classes, but i believe they have to stat selectable. then i would completely agree with you
---
They are never going to kill mesmer, it's the class iconic to their franchise, it had a suicidal place in GW1 and so will it remain in gw2
---
What do you mean by this?
---
KP and ostracizing. yeah that's a dick move.
---
I know guild members that do that, but even if I had 3 sets of leggo armor, I know best not to treat others like shit for not having KP - at the end of the day, it's just a game.
---
Please do not mention upvotes in your post title, please re-submit your post with a better title.

A part of the secret is stylizing the graphics of the world.  The more realistic you try make your graphics, the easier you'll find your stuff getting dated for a host of reasons beyond just the graphics... Performance for example.  
---
So other than boosts or tomes, I usually level by switching back and forth between everything. Depends on the level and the zone.
---
Early game is the hardest because your skills hit enemies like wet paper. I usually do hearts/exploration/event chaining till 30 when you can run AC story. The old dungeons give you decent starter money for not a lot of difficulty. I usually do them once a day when they have a group up in LFG, otherwise I move to a relevant zone for my level.
---
In each zone it helps to look for good long event chains. You can also abuse bonus XP by going to where mobs are that players likely haven't killed recently and clear those out. This works amazing if you have any sort of buff to stack with it (bday booster, food, util, etc). Once you aren't getting bonus XP just move to a new area (hint, Lornar's Pass and the other zones like it over there are great for this around lvl 50). Fighting mobs 3-6 levels higher than you and using their bonus XP is also great.
---
When that gets boring I usually take a break and level crafting, but that is only a really lucrative way to level if you have the critical experience gain booster. It's still good without it though and gives you a break.
---
If you are good you don't need many gear refreshes, just try and keep the best weapon equipped that you can and enough survivability that you aren't dying and wasting time.
---
It also sounds like a great idea to just ban everyone if your cheat detector somehow decides Firefox or Chrome is a cheat engine. After all - what will those people do? File a ticket? If they all file a ticket, we can flag those as spam! Perfect solution. And if false positives are rare, what can a single person do? Complain on forums? We have moderators to remove such things. Complain on reddit? Who will believe them? 
---
I have 13,148 spirit shards and wouldn't mind an quick, easy way to get rid of of them too.
---
But then I can't seem to eat enough dragonite, empyreal frags, bloodstone either.. and 3000+ obsidian shards I can't use up plus 4000 tomes of knowledge.  I guess we'll need an eater for everything.  Eventually these things always pile up when their uses and value degrades.
---
Ideally ANet could add a currency conversion vendor.  Say 50-70% return on converting something we can't use to something we can.
---
Almost, it is the right race
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama is not allowed.

Second plot twist: One of the other dragons awakens and absorbs to become a greater alpha dragon and the cycle repeats till all dragons but aurene is left --- this is the latest outcome, unfortunately.
---
Since GW2 released, I really want to see a Bard mesmer spec. The profession would fit really well as a supporter/cc character. I would keep it close to a D&amp;D or Pathfinder buffer Bard.
---
Weapon: Longbow - You shoot mystic arrows that pierce friendly characters healing a small amount of health and damage enemies. With a bit of AoE capability on Skill 3 and 5 that heals targets inside the area and either blinds or cripples enemies.
---
Shatter Abilities: Mesmerizing Performance- Every Shatter Skill has a buff or debuff component that is active during the time this song lasts. The more clones you shatter, the longer the song lingers in an area around you. You can also only have 1 performance up at any given time. Should you use another performance the one already active will end.
---
F1 is replaced with Song of Courage - Pulses might out to friendly targets nearby.
---
F2 is replaced with Song of Fascination - Slows enemy movement and attack speed.
---
F3 is replaced with Countersong - Interrupts up to 10 nearby enemies and apply weakness.
---
F4 is replaced with Song of Reviving - Rally downed characters and apply regeneration to everyone around you.
---
F5 would be Mesmerizing Masterpiece - Performances don't need to be active for "Chord" and "Finale" abilities. (More in Utility)
---
The new utility skill category would be called Chords and all have 3 different flips attached to them.
---
Weak Chord - Reduced skilleffect when no Mesmerizing Performance is currently active.
---
Chord - Skill has full potential when used while a Mesmerizing Performance is active.
---
Finale - Chain skill that only unlocks after you use a Chord while Mesmerizing Performance is active. Finale skills also end the current active Mesmerizing Performance and lock it for a couple of seconds before recharge begins. (Big effect with the downside that the Performance is unavailable for a certain amount of time)
---
The healing would be more group orientated like "Wash the pain way" from ele and the utilities are focused on healing, buffing and CC enemies. For example: (Please keep in mind that I don't balance that shit and this is the reason why I won't add any potency numbers. It is just an idea and not a concept that can be replicated one to one.)
---
Healing Refrain - When you use it without a Performance active, it is only a medium heal for the mesmer. When Performance is active, it will also produce a soundwave that heals up to 10 friendly characters around you for a small amount. If you trigger the Finale after that, it will burst out another wave that heals again for a small amount and grants regeneration plus protection.
---
Utility: Dirge of Doom - When used without a performance active, it fears 5 enemies around you for a short amount of time. When Performance is active it fears 10 enemies and the fear lasts longer. If you trigger the Finale it will also apply Pain in addition to fear.
---
Elite: Final Curtain - When used without a performance active, the mesmer sacrifice 50% of it's max. health, healing the same amount of HP on up to 5 players around it. (You can put yourself in downed state with this) When used while performing, the mesmer sacrifice 75% of it's max health, healing up to 5 players around it and you can't put yourself in downstate anymore (you will stay at 1 health and get invulnerability for 1 seconds.) The finale can only be used when your health is under 10% of your max. HP. You regenerate 33% of your max health every 2 second for the next 6 seconds, dealing the same amount of damage to 5 enemies around you.
---
Hmmm, can we trade them for 1 copper each? Or better - for dungeon tokens, no one needs to play dungeons then! 
---
I know what you mean, I think I had more at one point but backed it off because it got a bit too purple/warm. Tricky to balance sometimes. :)
---
Same. One of the main reason is indeed overconfidence. I really don't get why people keep trying to run stuff like solo druid on SH, Dhuum, Matthias etc in a 100% pug group. Just don't. Or if you really have to give it a try, atleast switch to the save strats after one or maybe two fails. You cannot force something like that to work in a group that hasn't played together at all before.

6-year vet here. imo, yes. any grind in gw2 is optional. you can level from 1-80 (80 is cap) completely by exploring and generally doing whatever you want. pretty much ANY kind of gameplay will give you exp. in terms of pvp, you can jump into the structured PvP very early, with no downside, except for your lack of experience. for WvW, you'll want to either wait until you're lvl 80 OR make sure to be in a fairly large group.

Well, I personally know when I don't have a certain set of applications or packages installed on my machine because I am the only person with access to my machine and I know what I install on it. Those particular applications are not at all going to be found natively on machines so to have them detected in your environment means that you deliberately installed them. Even in Gaile Grey's forum message, she states that any person with any incidence of those applications detected running on their machine, regardless of how benign their usage, will be suspended for the purposes of security and game integrity. UNF is a cheat engine, it's not going to be a signature put out by your unconventional mouse or graphics engine. There's a glaring misconception you have about their methods. You seem to think they're accusing you of explicitly cheating. They're not. They detected banned third party software running alongside GW2 consistently for nearly a month concurrently. Whether or not you used it to cheat isn't why you were banned, clearly:  
---
\&gt; \[accounts were\] suspended because we detected that the accounts were running Guild Wars 2 at the same time as one or more of &gt;the following programs over a significant number of hours during a multi-week period earlier this year. We targeted &gt;programs that allow players to cheat and gain unfair gameplay advantages, even if those programs have other, &gt;more benign uses.   
---
I'm sorry to hear about your friend, but as someone who suffers from bi-polar depression, I know that other people with depression and myself included tend to dramatize situations like these, concentrate all of their emotive energy on a situation out of their control (death of a family member - I have lost parents at a young age, not just friends) avoid personal responsibility for moving on or exercising healthier mental or physical habits, and often blame other things for their own complacency. I'm not here to tell you how to get on, but I think we can say clearly that ArenaNet made a decision, explained their rationale, and while you may not have been cheating explicitly, you still went out of your way to have third party software running that could be flagged. And once again, this has nothing to do with your deceased friend, your mental illness, or anything else. The judgement may be a broad sweep, but it was done according to the ToS and ArenaNet retains the rights to perform the action they did. If you don't want to make a new account and stop using banned 3rd party software (that is mostly unnecessary, I know this because I know myself and many others that don't play with really anything running alongside GW2 besides discord), then don't play, but don't act like you've been personally victimized without rationale when you just don't like the rationale. It's not ArenaNet's responsibility to make sure your environment adheres to their ToS to keep you from getting banned. That's on you.
---
Character limit and model to low. Shadows to low. Everything else on very high or high to your choosing. Enable LOD effect check box. Tweak whatever other checkboxes but personally I only check effect lod and ambient occlusion. Verify you have sampling set to native and those settings will net you the fps you need. I pull 90-110 in less populated areas and a semi stable 60 in wvw until a zerg rolls by. 
---
They've already developed the feature of gobblers and merchants/day. It shouldn't be hard to create some more.
---
Yep. Not a weapon, to be fair, but all three medium classes have it and none of the others do.
---
Agree completely, but I thought it was worth mentioning for someone asking about the game with grinding in mind. 
---
Exactly... so why do you want an Aurene Skin for the griffon? xD
---
For those, I'd settle for a portal tome for lounge passes and the city scrolls. A tome for all the tomes wouldn't be bad.
---
Thank you for your submission. We already have a post up about this, however. It is also better to link directly to the relevant site, not through twitter.
---
It isn't represented in-game at all, perhaps its in the area of Kryta's south coast we haven't been to yet but apart from in that book there is no other reference to it. 
---
Yeah most people will. Others will actually check out the dailies, maybe get roped into some guild stuff or decide to just check out the TP while they're there... One thing leads to the other. This is why login rewards exist in f2p games in the first place.
---
Honestly, this should just be the banner of this sub the day before patchday.
---
You can get 55 of them per month if they really want the weapon set.  So only 6-7 weeks.
---
Just in case: make sure you check all you email folders, I recently had the exact same problem and didn’t notice the deva replied in just a few hours but it went strait to spam.
---
Don't stop there!
---
Could also also use a gobbler gobbler that gobbles gobblers to turn them into gobbler gobbler vendor tabs, so you could have your gobbler gobbler gobble all gobblers to have them all as a single gobbler. 
---
Well, it'll take me another month to get enough lmao
---
You need other stuff too
---
really doesnt matter. just enjoy!  
---
Here is how I levled up:  
---
I tried all kinds of weapons to see which skills I liked best. I ended up using Great Sword, Sword and Focus I think (loved the pulling thingy).  I didnt care about traits at this points, cause there was no such direct effect on my gameplay. Thus, I used my hero points on skills first.   
---
and it went like this: uuuh, mantra sounds cool! lemme unlock the next Mantra. Ok cool, how about a Signet, lets unlock that one next... and so on and so on.  
---
I appreciate this a lot about GW: At the beginning, just choose based on what you like, and nothing else. I would not care about meta or anything at this point. Just pure enjoyment :)  
---
&gt;No need. There was nothing removed except the Ancient Karka meta event. We don't need a version of the map that is the exact same except a lack of a carcass and a few structures. I'd rather they just re-add the Settler events, easier and more reasonable.
---
Settler events should be added back to the open world version. Old Southsun Cove should be there to relieve the Ancient Karka meta-event, with the destruction of terrain and such.
---
&gt;I would rather have these decorations added as part of Festival of the Four Winds.
---
Dragon Bash isn't just an event, it had story instances dealing with Mai Trin before she was accused of the murder. Not sure if the celebrations fit with FotFW anyway, maybe a new festival?
---
Old LA could return during festivals only too, but I'd rather get the pure version with no festival stuff on top of it.
---
&gt;I could see the merit here, a Lab Cliffs with Zephyrite ships. I would rather see Season 1 return in the Story Journal and this be used for the Bazaar/Cutthroat Politics arc. Baring that, a VIP pass could be used for this too. There's no reason to have it as a full out zone always available though.
---
We have smaller zones like Bloodstone Fen always available. I would prefer if this was an open world zone, but they moved the story forward with the last FotFW so that's no longer a possibility.
---
They could always expand it as well. The return of LW1 could see its locations handled differently, maybe with even new maps. For example, they could move Cragstead and the hatchery into a new location (south of Wayfarer's Foothills) and recreate the Flame and Frost events there, with less restrictions. Same for the marionette, they could take her and the whole watchwork army into another new zone, and add more events before it, ala Silverwastes.
---
Either way, LW1's return should bring those maps back as open world content, not just story instances.
---
&gt;Not sure there's enough non-aesthetical difference here. And the events that existed here but don't now could, in all honesty, be added to post-ToN maps, like the Settler, Molten Alliance, and Scarlet invasion events. Presuming they have the map itself, I'd rather see it return for a S1 in the story journal, as unlikely as such is.
---
There's five versions of Kessex Hills (pre-tower, invisible tower, tower, tower destroyed, salma destroyed). The three important ones are still around.
---
The should have expanded the Ley-Energy Matter Converter to include all of them into a single item.
---
Sorry, but how do you buy it? I can't find it in the wiki.
---
&gt; The argument OP is making revolves around skill progression being unsustainable because there aren't enough difficult fractals to motivate or sustain a desire to improve.
---
... that should've been plainly obvious from the beginning. PvE is ultimately predictable, and playing it will only progress your skills up to the point where you can reliably beat the AI, and no further.
---
the answer to this "problem" isn't vertical gear progression. vertical gear progression actually makes the problem worse, because it invalidates every achievement that comes beforehand.
---
the true answer to this "problem" is to abandon PvE and go into PvP, where the average skill level, especially among the top, gradually rises as players compete against each other.
---
I think it's you that needs to re-read this in a different tone in your head. After having her "breath taken away" she asks "do you really think the Devs should justify every position?" That's absurd for anyone even related to a Developer's position to say. Now, I'll admit she gets more polite in her second paragraph but it's less-so about how aggressive or anything it comes off as (though it definitely is) as how just fucked up her answers are. A 10 year old after being taught any manners would have answered the question more appropriately
---
 shit thats creepy
---
Returning player, played the game for just a few hours, already decided to get both expansions since they’re on sale XD
---
Anyway, buying both gave me 2 lvl 80 boosters and 2 Shared Inventory slots. Do I keep the slots? Or do they disappear if I take the boosts out?
---
I ain't complaining about a "low cost" and ain't asking for a higher cost; I'm just highlighting an issue...
---
&gt; I think it's time to add a couple **vanity skins/items tied to large amounts of laurels**.
---
...and offering a solution. For veterans/stockpilers, laurels aren't really a timegate, they can breeze through them, and it's hard to balance around those players. Expensive vanity items could drain those reserves and put everyone on more even ground.
---
I like it.  Or even Xandra if they wanted to drop some GW1 lore.
---
It is described as a Krytan port, and outside the novel once referenced ingame. It seemed like a pretty big deal back then so I thought it would be at least crucial to know where it was located.
---
I disagree. Having bad gear and a bad build is what first time players are supposed to have when they reach level 80 for the first time. That’s normal and is part of the normal game progression. I was a new player on a boosted 80 and even though I had been playing MMO’s for years I was still kinda lost. Going back and leveling my first character 1-80 definitely prepared me for endgame more than I would have been. And it only took a week or two. And I feel way more connection to my characters now having gone through that journey with at least 1-2 of them. Now I boost, but at first I’m really glad I didn’t. 
---
Actually, it depends on the effect. Most speed effect from player skills and traits do not stack, but some effects can add to your speed after buffs. 
---
And while it can't go over a cap,  extra movement effects can compensate snare effects. Like when you move at more than normal speed when you have both superspeed and crippled.
---
I don't think that about the commander.  Because it is a game.
---
 [**u/Varorson**](https://www.reddit.com/user/Varorson/) suggested the same in this thread. I can't agree more. I just want more sinks for Spirit Shards, them being a Gobbler or a Merchant or a Merchant/day, anything really.
---
&gt; If I knew this was coming, I might have saved them.
---
ANet could've utilized laurels as a currency more consistently. Then people would've expected something like this and planned accordingly.
---
You can sell your tomes to guilds for I think 60-80s each. That'd be a good way to make a quick buck. As for the Ascended Mats, why not refine them and fill up the 2k mat storage with Ingots and Stars then trash the rest. I know I'll regret saying it now, I'd kill to have your problem right now lol. 
---
What are these skins called?
---
In January of last year I was diagnosed with some health problems so decided to set some long term game goals for the year.  I had only started playing the summer before so I just worked on getting all the masteries done and work on legendaries I wanted (shining blade).
---
The WvW stuff I had set a goal of full legendary armor and rank 2k by September.  Since I work from home and had some  health stuff come up I had a lot more time for the game.  I could focus on 8-10 wvw ranks a day pretty easily.  There were 1-2 double exp weekends during that time where I got 250+ ranks. 
---
It's also worth noting that unlike the other two novels, Sea Of Sorrows released after Guild Wars 2 did. Although I assume it was being worked on during the games development cycle as well. 
---
That’s awesome! My wife wanted me to take a standard picture after I deleted all of my characters..
---
Kidding she is supportive of my gaming
---
Is it confirmed that there's a balance patch other than the usual micro-tweaks? 
---
if its cosmetics, always check the shop first.
---
Well you can craft a Rustooth for example literally in less then a minute. You just have to find a way that works for you. There are many ways to earn gold with spirit shards, some are a lot more tedious (but also more efficient in terms of gold per spirit shard) and some are really fast.
---
Yeah that seemed too cheap, thanks. 
---
This would be good..... What would be even better is a luck gobbler !!!! 
---
Dual wielding The Binding of Ipos as a brawler is going to be quite interesting to see.
---
&gt; abandoned
---
might be true, but my point still stands. PvE is where you go to stagnant, PvP is where you want your skills to improve. and if the PvP isn't to your liking, the solution is to go play a different game.
---
complaining about GW2's PvE not being able to continuously challenge you, is like complaining that Street Fighter's arcade mode isn't challenging after a while. if you want to be challenged, you have to play against real people.
---
Patches generally are expected at 9AM PST/12 EST. There are sometimes delays for various reasons, but this is the standard time.
---
No i know this for some time and I even talked in some past post about it, but people called me crazy and downwoted ofc, because it is not a "i draw my character" post.
---
I wont quit, its free anyway, but there is nothing left for me here long-term, so I will probably just login do all achievements for the new map/fractal in 12h and then I will wait another 4 months for new content palying better games that actually care about their long term supporters. 
---
While you are technically right about ANet's poor communication skills (it's no secret \*\*and\*\* there have been several outcries this past year about their PR team being incompetent) it should also be noted that ANet is usually very quiet about anything that's not going to be released within a week or two.
---
A thread could rack up 10k upvotes and stay on the front page for two months and ANet would still ignore it unless it threatened to seriously impact their business. That's why them stating clearly that they "lost the assets" makes sense:
---
1) they said something about it rather than ignore it,
---
2) they strike me as the kind of company that has no idea what it's doing, especially in a transition phase like LS1 where assets were being developed one week for the next just to be dropped soon thereafter.
---
Ah yes, I love seeing these threads EVERY...SINGLE...TIME there's an expected patch.
---
I also love seeing the inevitable complaints that follow once the said patch goes live.
---
Endless entertainment.
---
I wonder if the new mastery "Bond of Faith" changes things like that up a bit.
---
Emm about 1 hour and 8 minutes minus 5 to 10 minutes. We should get a notice about the patch 10 minutes before.
---
I’ve been playing gw2 for awhile and never got a lot of laurels I saved up only 200 in 3 years. I don’t know how I’m gonna get that much. 
---
do you call men playing video games "boy gamers"?
---
Let's not talk about that, please. Sunspear and Darkspear being staves pretty much confirmed once and for all that we're never getting polearms ;\_;
---
I am memeing about Anet abandoning every content except the open world. I remember back when PvP was big. Tho tbh, PvE has the potential to be as fun and challenging as PvP if it was updated with difficult content more often, like as this guy suggests, more CMs, raids, etc. 
---
No... No I do not want to be carried.. I want to know the shit, do the shit and get rewarded for the shit.
---
But everyone is soo dam must this must that.. that no one wants to go through learning through pugs. So you then get pugs faking crap to get carried through.
---
It's all player issues created by players and made worse by the lazy god dam lazy players.
---
I dont condemn exp players wanting exp players..
---
Talk about immature, lol.

I always spend my Laurels on mats, lol. Fortunately, I'm not fond of the weapon skins so whatever.
---
&gt; Looks like no one proofread the article. Misspellings and typos are frequent throughout the piece.
---
Why be right, when you can be first?
---
 He and really cheap ones who do not have to dark :)

Extremely well done.  Hair is hard, you have talent

Elementalist with longbow

---
Did you exploit bubble?
---
Chrono and druid. Tho people are now experimenting with different support options to the chrono monopoly.
---
that's wonderful 
---
You're missing the point that the person above you is making. Calling both the world and the continent Tyria would be like calling Earth Asia instead. Sure Asia has the vast majority of the population, but calling the world Asia would just be bizarre.
---
Additionally, core maps are all set before the events of each expansion for the most part. Some have had some changes (like the Elonian refugees in Lion's Arch or half of Kessex Hills), but this has generally been the case since after LWS1 finished. So for those Elonian's in Divinity's Reach, the events of Path of Fire have not happened yet, and Elona is still inaccessible to them.
---
Stop spending them?  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
So tired of people saying this. It's bullshit.  
---
An OCed 2600x equals intel counterpart, GW2 is no exception to that.  
---
This "AMD CPUs are shit for GW2" bandwagon really needs a halt.
---
Or the one all the way to the right with the “what am I doing here” expression? ;)
---
I literally bought him last week after getting over 100 laurels and thinking, "well, dunno what else I'd get with these". 🤦‍♂️
---
Where do I get these skins
---
You scared me for a second with that title.
---
With the T6 mats being not worth much I started hoarding them. Not that hard but 85 is not too bad for a whole set of weapons.
---
Also, you should spend some! Have you ever done so with that amount of laurels?
---
I wanted to cite the revenant weapons as an example of "you never know" but I figured that a couple of weapons would be a different case than a whole map. Some employee probably found some 3D models for the weapons in a half-forgotten folder while looking for something else.
---
&gt;They also made a few town clothes tonics, and years later turned them back into outfits.
---
But the tonics never really disappeared and I don't think ANet ever claimed to have lost the assets.
---
True, old LA never really disappeared, either, but again an outfit (well... more like a dozen, really) isn't as big as a map. I may be wrong though; if six years from now ANet announces "ancestral Lion's Arch access license (2 weeks)" I won't be surprised one bit.

When it's ready (TM)
---
Yeah, it was fun! I was in the group that started at Sloth, then I went to get some Scourge action at Soulless Horror. Both were pretty rough lol.. but I think we performed well for mostly newbies. I'm not really new to raids but, those were two bosses I had very little experience on, especially SH. But now I do! 
---
Thanks again for setting that up.
---
Checkout /u/sankurix's Engineer build [here](http://tekkitsworkshop.net/index.php/guild-wars-2/general-guides/55-engineer-pve-farming-build).
---
You didnt even need to take the Background separate. 
---
&gt; Hmmm, can we trade them for 1 copper each?
---
I'd gladly take 1c for most of this account-bound bloat! 
---
100 oil + 100 dust + 100 ley = 1 Crystalline Ore? I'm down for that too!  I'll even take a Forge recipe for it: 100 of each + Mystic Crystal = 1 C-Ore. Then I can use the junk items *and* my spirit shards!
---
Love it even more after watching this video

Ding ding ding, that's right XD

Fractal specific buffs usually stack.
---
Potion + Swampland Vigor buff is an example of that, so we'll see.
---
85?! Jesus fuck!
---
*Looks at laurrls* oh... K
---
Well, they have to start somewhere.  We can hope that this will be the beginning of more laurel-related items, although frankly I've never minded having something to dump into past novelties, money, and mats for legendaries.
---
If you're a guild leader or in charge of decorations,you need tons of it for the recent gh (joko decorations) released but you would also have to cover your own needs such as the magic needs for the weapon sets in the next patch or the armor set in the last patch and then if you're a home node collector there's the 10k needed for the nodes released every patch, I'm not saying I'm hard up for magic, but I'm saying I do have to put in an effort to make sure I get the magic I need to have these things covered while still doing other things I like such as wvw, but that's how it should be, magic shouldn't drop from the sky.
---
I did it just to be sure. If anything happend in between, I still had the background to work with. Otherwise we had to reshoot everything (worst case scenario)
---
No, I don't have a spare gold for your listed on TP Mystic Coins.
---
80 total.
---
I forgot to enable mine before I left for work 😫
---
You've gotten other good advice here, but I wanted to share a link if you decide to play gw2 on a max lvl 80 as a first-time player.
---
http://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World
---
These are meant to work well without a group out in PvE and synergizing condi/power weapon sets with the right traits and utilities makes a huge difference in how much you enjoy the game and how effective you are.
---
Eh, they don't get in my way like Ascended mats do, so I'm fine with it. 
---
Sylvari are the best, but that Charr on the top left is hilarious and cute. Almost tempted to make one. 
---
I dislike them as well.
---
They didn't kill the hype for me, since I chose not to watch any of them, but it's annoying to go through all the Posts in New and seeing all the Video Posts as well as the Posts talking about them just to skip them to not spoil anything.
---
Even more than that, I dislike all the Guides that hit as soon as the Episode goes live, just because the Partners already got access to the Episode. For all the Newssites I understand it, since they can release their articles and what not, but imo all the Guides ruin the Achievements since most people just follow them braindead and don't discover anything for themselves.
---
You have one already. Its called legendary crafting.
---
They’re the expansions 
---
Yep, you've got about the right idea for this game.
---
If by everything you mean all content outside of Living World Episdoes you didn't login for, yes.
---
Based on preview, buying the recipes is volatile magic + laurels. Recipe is standard exotic components, diviner's inscription, and new map material. Unclear how to get/make diviner's inscription.
---
Guardian mace/hammer shield combo pure healing aka a Cleric 
---
NEW ARMOR??
---
After gearing a ton of alts I've got something like 42 laurels.  Hoping the full set isn't a collection achievement and that this isn't one of those episodes that requires every single achievement for completion.  Otherwise... oof, timegate!
---
Bat file pings the API, but in the end it starts the game and connects to the proper servers as well. Without such tool GW2 clients would be more scattered in time. ;)
---
Never said it's a bad thing. My daredevil's weapon is Nevermore. 
---
We could be able to reenact the scene in the Bourne movies where he punches a book on someone's face.
---
Alles oder nichts! 
---
So when the patch is gonna be up??
---
YES, APPLE ARMOR!
---
Do you like enemies that can't be blinded, and can block or stunlock you for 5 seconds straight?
---
Because we've got the thing for you. Not just dredge - *branded* dredge.
---
Expecting a TekkitsWorkshop video of all the collectibles in a couple hours
---
Couldn't you just schedule the command `gw2.exe -image` to run periodically throughout the day?
---
I ran power Herald against Conjured Amalgamate a couple days ago because I wanted a change from Holosmith. Wasn't top DPS but wasn't too far off, plus the extra ferocity and lifesteal facet on allies makes up for some of it. All in all I think power Herald is basically fine to run in raids.
---
That's what, 1,000 oranges?
---
6 raids per year implies 12 episodes per year ;p
---
Is this a spoiler?
---
at least the spear/trident/harpoon gun aren't going to have a gen 2 weapon so that just leaves greatsword xD
---
1100*
---
Technically the world's name is Thyria. But over the millennia, dialect changed it to Tyria, the name of the largest continent in the world which takes up probably over 4/5ths of the world's landmass.
---
That's a solid choice, but sword/sword gives you a block. Focus has good damage and a defensive skill that interrupts and pulls your enemies to a specific spot and is *great* when you get the hang of it. 
---
When given the choice, get gear with power as a stat, with precision or ferocity as a second one. That'll help you do more damage. 
---
Phantasmal disenchanter and phantasmal defender are two skills you probably want to unlock nice and soon. They really help with levelling. Mantra of Pain is also a decent attack.
---
For specifications, I'd go for Illusions or Duelling - both are very good all-rounders. Pick one and just keep working on it when there aren't any skills you want to unlock. 
---
Focus on throwing illusions at your enemies, shattering your clones when you have three of them and keeping out of the fray when you need to. 
---
Unlock hero points when you find them as this will help you unlock skills and traits earlier. 
---
Rox joins the Olmakhan? No-one saw that coming. I'm shocked! /s
---
1) Log on and IMMEDIATELY get started on story
---
2) Rush through the story at least somewhat quickly so I cannot be spoiled by anyone
---
3) Speaking of spoilers, turn off map chat
---
4) Finish story, then get 100% map completion on my main who has every other map in the game explored
---
that's like 16 wall breaks
---
I just recently spent like 400 laurels on mats towards WvW Legendary armor. Good thing I still have 600, I was considering spending more.
---
"Then don't watch them" how original. Honestly, it's less the videos (I don't really see them) but why is the german community apparently totally spoiling the whole patch? Like, did ANet forget an NDA somewhere? It's kind of weird/dumb to let a site just give every detail of the patch before the patch even hits.
---
We did it at the secret location in the Grove. There the lighting is locked. 
---
It is the first time I did this, so I don't really much know about it. But you'll find a link [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Day_and_night) with the day and night cycle in the game. There are also some locations where the cycle is locked, so it has always the same lighting.
---
If you want to make screenshots where there is a cycle, I think you'll have to take each picture at roughy the same time in the cycle. Unfortunatly ,that would take ages to complete then.
---
Well in the current format. I was referencing the raid developer who said they could release 6 a year.
---
Aww thanks!
---
Unfortunately I'm in NA 
---
I am 4k hours veteran. I quit one year ago bacause i just cant stand raids. I still thun kthey dont belong to this casual mmo. And they only add only raides. I wonder what % of the players are acually playing raids weekly.
---
Do not forget that the current maps are a 'summary' of what the actual Tyria would be, not 1:1 Tyria. 
---
So there's things that are smaller than they should be, or jut outright omitted.
---
you should have it on a shared inventory spot
---
humans in GW are useless! Seraphs can't even kill a centaur!
---
Hey you don't have to call me out like that..
---
Lol! I has the same exact thought. Should be fun.
---
i spent them all to craft astralaria and spent again while crafting sharur. do not think i'll get 95 soon
---
Port Stalwart was near waterfalls and existed without cliffs on it's port. That kicks Garrenhoff off of the list of possible locations.
---
Luckily I keep my laurels always over 100.
---
quite smart to check the build with the API, but i think it cann be imrpoved by checking the local build then the API one to see if there is a difference.
---
i ll check (when i have the time) if there is a non binary file you can read with the info or an other way to find it..
---
check that script /u/BackisBachus
---
To be short, we don't know. We know some defining features of it, but no known location.
---
We are not. Season 4 is followed by Season 5 and then expansion
---
As someone who recently returned, the game feels very alive. Moreso than most other mmorpgs because the world design lends to naturally bringing people together for large scale world boss events.
---
Instanced PvP and WvW are niche in this game (just like raiding is) but it still has a dedicated player base that actively participate. TBH GW2 is very healthy and feels alive from the start zones all the way to the end game, with the only "dead" areas being random unpopular zones around the middle of the game. But you've little or no need to go there anyway.
---
I feel bad for you. 
---
it's a way when the update is here you ll still continue to kill this process and download part by part when it loop
---
pink eye from hazardous experiments
---
You already have a perfectly good laurel sink since you can get T6 mats for them. There is absolutely no need to add a new sink just because you haven't spent your laurels yet. Laurels already have a sink. 
---
&gt; For veterans/stockpilers, laurels aren't really a timegate, they can breeze through them, and it's hard to balance around those players.
---
But you can just convert them into t6 mats. They already have a good incentive. 
---
But if you buy these skins you will go under 100 this not always keeping your laurels above 100. 
---
As a new player I spent all of my laurals last night on ranger chests. I had 50 or 60 didn't get Jack squat good out of it. And this came after thinking laurals were worthless haha I'm not buying anything ever again
---
Why would you log off if your goal is to get skins? Skins don't appear when you aren't playing.
---
Anet pls
---
Except that all the people in-game get a nice countdown telling them when the patch will be available, so the update servers already get a flood of connections at the same time. :)
---
Yeah if you refuse to learn how to play the raids than don't be surprised if no one wants you to be there.
---
When I played Destiny I did the raids first with friends going over a guide. I never once joined an LFG having no idea what to do. And when I did host my own raids once I was good enough I kicked people who didn't know what to do when I specifically asked for experience because we were trying to get through things fast. I'm not going to do a 10 hour raid when an experienced group can do it in 1. 
---
If you want to raid and you have no experience you can either watch videos and read guides to learn how the raids work, or you can join training groups. Those are your options. Otherwise, don't raid. There are lots of training groups. Join the discords or ask in map chat. 
---
I've spent most of my laurels on legendary shards...
---
where can you get them?
---
That is fair, I do find myself with every patch needing more magic for the node but it never takes too long and I find that is a good balance for a currency to keep that content relevant. And the decorations I get I'm a leader/scribe too and decorations are killer on personal funds, crowdfunding for decorations rarely happens.
---
I always assumed it was one of the islands south west of Fort Stalwart. 
---
it s a GET request, that s low effort CRUD request -&gt; low processing -&gt; low energy consumption
---
also you can block request on the API side if it s using too much disponibility (API Management) i think anet thought about that before releasing the API (as every company should)
---
Were you playing full screen and alt tabbing?  If so have you tried considering using a program like http://www.brianapps.net/sizer4/
---
its usually up at 9am seattle time so assuming in 10min
---
And, to make it even more fun (for them), we're putting their entire area on scaffolding. 
---
The projectile noise sounds a lot like the lighthouse in Lion's Arch near the top - but less deep. Neat.
---
That was mentioned in an article recently, probably the same one they got the screenshots from. It's much the same as any other inscription, except it requires 100 of the new map's currency; how much of a pain that will be remains to be seen. I just hope that the collection for all of them (also mentioned by that article) isn't required for the Ascended versions, or it's going to be quite the slog even if the currency isn't the next Blood Ruby.
---
Either way to answer your question, no this will not cause any harm. Anet is prepared for everyone to download the game the second they get the "New Build Available" message in-game and people who keep checking for patch notes. 
---
I wouldn't worry about it. 
---
Like the poster below me, I too came from WoW to GW2(but I played GW2 at launch and also played a bit when each Xpac came out).
---
Comparing to WoW, GW2 feels fare more alive and active. The multiple world bosses cycling all day long mean zones as early as lvl15 are active all the way to current xpac lvl80 zones. All raid content is relevant, despite some of it being 2+ yrs old now? I'm working on world completion currently and I'm amazed at how many players I encounter when going through zones, only the most remote zones are "dead" and even then I still stop and do the odd event I come across and frequently find 2-3 others joining me.
---
The dailies also give you a reason to visit older zones for jumping puzzles, event completions or just harvesting/vista requirements.
---
I think GW2 is the one mmorpg that feels truly alive and even if its population was declining you don't feel it because of how they design their world and the content in it.
---
+ "flood of connection" from "offline" people who could be at work but just run such batch. ;)
---
Hmm this is quite new all the info pouring in well before patch.
---
I've heard this a lot to be quite honest, why do you think this?
---
I love how everybody turns into a master of fucking sarcasm when all I said was that I don't want to grind the same shit for a month.
---
Engaging shit that takes a month? Fine by me.
---
Grinding shit for 3 days? Fine by me.
---
Grinding shit for a month? GTFO.
---
What the fuck is so hard to understand about a single fucking sentence that you feel the need to misintepret shit in a way that fits your own imagination? Get out.
---
Using that Task Scheduler? Probably. There are multiple ways to do this. This one more friendly since it stops once it see's a new build and doesn't require people to put things in the Task Scheduler.
---
If you build as Buffer/DPS. You gonna mostly camp Glint activating 2 Facet that give might , fury. Fire away that Swiftessness on CD.
---
When target about to be broken by CC. Get the Elite Facet up and F2 to drain energy . Then Fire everything especially the Might facet first. Then switch to Another Legend for burst damage.
---
You get more DPS maintaining a skill which drain your energy and consume might Facet .So unload your Sword skill after use all the Facet and Switch to another Legend.
---
Sounds like he's just talking about things people have asked for, not things Anet has indicated might be coming, nor a list of things Anet has changed that would lead to build templates (which was what I thought you were indicating)
---
-image actually makes gw2.exe end if there is nothing to download, or if the update download is complete. However, if you just keep throwing these, you'll end up with a lot of "can't open two gw2.exe sessions" error messages, which will be fun to clean up when back home. Perhaps just check if gw2.exe is running before launching another one, and simply end the script if it is the case?
---
I was saving them up to get the cat tonic for 100. Finally hit that yesterday, bought it. have 0 laurels now. Worst day ever lol. 
---
And the best part is you only need to relog once the patch drops, no bullshit 8-10hrs maintenance. Damn, I've missed GW2.
---
Thought druids have fallen out of T4 meta now. 
---
The level cap is 80, and it will always remain that way. They haven't, nor will they ever, increased the level cap with an expansion. This way, once you get to 80, you don't need to grind to the next level and gear cap to experience the new content.   
---
In PvP and WvW, you get upscaled to 80, so you can play from the start.  
---
In PvE, you will still have to level up to 80. It honestly doesn't take that long because you get experience from exploring. You don't even have to do the "quests," which take the form of hearts. You can just explore the maps, which can be fun in its own right, and level up to 80 that way. Or, if you have the cash to do it, you can buy a level 80 boost. Once level 80, it doesn't take long to get exotic gear, and you're pretty much ready for most of the level 80 content. You can also still work toward getting ascended gear, which is only really necessary for fractals.
---
Should only be micro-tweaks. 
---
RIP Taimi T\_T
---
I really dislike them. I have come to trust articles with gw2 because it was always enough teaser for hype but no spoilers to kinda ruin my experience. This time i have had to avoid everything, which makes me a bit sad. Also if it wasn't for warnings here i would have clicked them and it would have annoyed me so much. So thank you for the people that posted here and that shaman on twitter. 
---
Shiro doesn't have *quickness* on Impossible Odds, it still has Superspeed but its just making you move around faster. Its mainly used because its a fixed drain on your energy for Forceful Persistence's active upkeep damage increase.
---
Thanks for the advice! Yeah, I'm also looking at doing more than twice as many characters, so it would be a multiple day project if lighting doesn't remain the same for long. I'm not actually sure if it just transitions at a point between night and day or if it constantly changes, but if I placed the characters in advance and the lighting remains the same for like 20 minutes I might be able to get them all done anyhow. That rules out instances though. My initial plan was the guild hall but that's *really* tough to do with the cycle and instability of the guild hall instance.
---
[Frodak](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Consular_Frodak_Steelstar) has not changed that much. 
---
I liked to think that [dwarves](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_Wiki:Projects/NPC_models/Dwarves) that did not have a full beard with a mustache were female ones because of their softer features.  
---
Maybe we'll hear his voice now, but I doubt they'll give him a female voice since the new model got a [male norn face](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/b/bc/Norn_male_faces.jpg).  
---
If that's the case, it'll be a bit of a shame. You practically only see female dwarves with beards in comics like Rat Queens. 
---
They did, there is a limit of 600 requests per minute per IP.
---
Pretty much this. I don't get hyped over seeing an area before I can actually play it since watching Destiny 2 "previews" that basically showcased 90% of the map and made them feel so much larger than they actually turned out. But seeing the new cosmetics or weapons is something I do get hyped for.
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
n bisschen früh sputti...
---
You get enough hero points at level 80 to unlock everything anyway, so don't worry much about specifics. You'll want to focus on getting at least one traitline unlocked completely first, since those give you more options. Otherwise you'll want to make sure you have enough damage to actually kill things. Make sure your gear is updated every 10 levels or so; it's pretty cheap to buy level-appropriate blue or green gear off the TP.
---
Others have linked the [metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World) page for builds if you want something in particular to work towards.
---
&gt; I wouldn't worry about it. 
---
I think in kind of similar way, but it is better to be safe than sorry.
---
Oh, also, what about AFK kick, I guess just pressing 1 every now and then on the camera character doesn't change view?
---
Fortunately corrupted creatures and evolved minions often lose invulnerabilities. 
---
There are so many by official ANet Partners and Media Websites that I believe they must be a new PR strat my ANet. Possibly to get more exposure of the game towards people not playing the game atm while the LS Season ramps up to its finale?
---
I'm an old UNIX admin, so that's why I appreciate it.  Woulda been cooler done in PowerShell or something, but, it gets the job done :-)
---
Open a training lfg, or join one. If you don't have time for that as well you probably don't have time for raids in general.
---
There are plenty of CM's without KP and you again don't need training groups for fractals cm or normal. A guide works fine. And if things goes wrong you ask questions. Training groups for raids i totally can understand that some people need. But fractals, not really.
---
Fun fact: the book is something that Angel McCoy created shortly before the original release of Guild Wars 2, after a discussion I had with her about lore and the wiki. As you said, it was a subtle nod that was trying not to be 4th-wall breaking, and being respectful of the wiki editor's passion for knowledge.
---
I prefer them.  I mean I'd like it much more if NOBODY would release spoilers, surprises, guides, etc until at least many weeks after a release.  But that isn't going to happen.  Everyone will finish all the non-grinding content within a couple of hours of release and then do all the same stuff with all the spoilers and such.
---
So basically, you're talking one day earlier.  And some people (not me) want as much as advance notice possible of everything (while still wanting even more during the release).  So for them, it's great.  And all those people who look at spoiler threads anyway can read more high quality ones right of instead.
---
I think personal hyping usually means personal disappointment.
---
But, you can treat this as one of two ways.  Look at all the posts titles to build up your hype more without reading content.
---
Or, do whatever you would do anyway, just one day earlier.
---
Yeah, don't know why more mmog don't pick up this feature, i don't think it is that hard to organize. 
---
I don't watch them cause I don't want them spoiled but it's nice that they are there for people who are interested in knowing more about the content.

I don't seem to be able to check who my match is (if I even got matched with someone to begin with -- I emailed the creators, hoping they can get the name of my match even though its past the deadline).
---
What you describe has been my experience pretty much every year I've participated -- always sent a gift, but never received one (the fact that some people are receiving gifts from multiple people this year just makes it feel like more of a kill joy that others don't receive any).
---
I loved the moment after you got it and you looked around like “now what?”

Laurels are log in rewards.
---
I was also in the group that did Sloth! We were sooo close to beating him it was insane with the amount of newbies we had. I've done Sloth maybe one time before that and was extremely surprised to see how well it went -- eventually I ended up leaving before we could beat him but man. That was great.  
---
Thanks again to the organizers of Raiders in Training! I joined a little over a week ago and I've been having so much fun learning all the raids! Never thought I'd be able to dip my feet into it until now.
---
Ohh I see it does call powershell for the GET request...
---
Given how Arenanet overreacts to reddit threads, no.  Don't give them bad ideas.
---
I made the mistake to oversee the AFK-kick. I disabled the hud, so I didn't know. I was kicked once, but managed to find the position back.
---
You can just use an attack where you don't change position, and you'll be good. But it is always best to check beforehand if it changes your camera.
---
Why even play the game with no Chauncey?
---
Make it a fractal where we have to initiate a Mesmer encounter by buying and apple from an illusion of Tybalt for 1 karma. 
---
Its not that pHerald is weak, its because pHerald's damage is consistent, basically its a power version of a condi build, it scales, then it stops. Very little burst that other, more stronger, power builds have, but because its really consistent on pretty much all situations that its a good option for a DPS class when dipping your toes into higher end game content but lack confidence when playing other classes.
---
I was using gw2launchbuddy and had 4 small windows on 1x 1440p screen, but still had to "alt tab" to have correct window in focus to move characters. 
---
I was farming breach+VW only, tagging some mobs with alts and hiding in safe spots and playing normally on main and it was still pretty annoying even if I didn't have to do  that much switching between accounts. I did it like few times and honestly  I'd rather have less gold but more chill farm than this.
---
I'm a semi-new MMORPG player (tried a lot but never gotten into them or gotten to end-game) and I have a question!
---
Am I missing something when it comes to getting to endgame content? This question isn't really unique to GW2, but it seems like every MMORPG expects you to just do the generic "kill x enemy" or "collect x thing" quests by yourself, wandering from point to point on the map doing this stuff, until you hit end game.
---
I'll go to town A, do the 4-5 generic quests, then go to town B, do the the same generic quests I did in town A but with a reskin, rinse and repeat for every zone.
---
I tried doing this with a friend but there's no depth or real reason because I never needed to call for heals, and there's no co-op abilities or any real strategy. It's just hit your abilities when they cooldown, again, rinse and repeat. I wouldn't call this cycle unfun, but I can't help but feel there must be more considering the popularity of the genre.
---
I've tried being social and talking to people, but virtually every MMO has given the same social experience. In that, everyone is too busy to talk because they're deadset on doing some specific task, or are just leveling like I am. 
---
What am I missing? Are MMOs just not for me? Thanks
---
I wish we could choose a reward-track instead of constantly getting spirit shards. Maybe even a new one with mystic coins, obsidian shards, clovers and amalgamated gemstones every once in a while.
---
:(
---
I spent all my laurels on ascended trinkets.  Then I finally started being able to save up laurels again.  Now I'm thinking about making a legendary weapon and I understand that requires a lot of laurels.  
---
Can you guys all give me some of your laurels, pls?
---
WTB laurels, 30k ok?
---
If you don't like them don't watch them
---
Coming as someone that ran the game until 2017 with 2 GB of ram (yes, 2gb of ram-- I'm not sure how it didn't explode) and thus had to run everything at low, I still thought there was plenty of good stuff, even if I couldn't even see most of the fancy effects. I'm more referring to the individual details hidden into the maps themselves and still manage to find random areas that seem to exist for no other reason than to be found.
---
imagine thinking fractals are still fun in 2019
---
Those from Arena Net is great, the rest is pissing me off. I dislike them to remove them from my reddit to make sure i wont get spoiled. Imo those should not be posted until release and i do not get why Arena Net let them or more likey even tell them it is ok or they would never be there until after release.
---
I didn't say other classes, I said THE GAME needs general balancing.  
---
(and not just in pve, pvp and wvw as well)
---
no. calm down
---
Decrease in content? We've had the most new fractals, maps, and armor that the game has ever put out... We're currently living in the golden age of Anet content delivery.
---
That's also why I used a lot the Priory imagery when I communicated information about the wiki on our social media channels :)
---
They look somewhat like tormented weapons lol
---
RIOT!
---
P A N I C
---
I'M OUTRAGED
---
 QUITTING THE GAME FOR A WHOLE 10 MINUTES
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Wait patiently my child
---
almost like its satire to pass the time!
---
the great thing about lfg is you can use it to make your own group with whatever requirements you want, or join one with requirements you can meet
---
they forgot about us
---
[When it's 5 minutes after regular patch time, and nothing popped up yet.](https://i.imgur.com/44a56QB.mp4)
---
Do tridents work as pitchforks?
---
Same. I had over 200 laurels and bought a bunch of stuff until I had about 10 because 'it's not like I will need them in the nearby future'. FML
---
She is just a basic bitch (read in holt's voice)
---
WTF I TOOK THE DAY OFF AND NOW THIS SHIT
---
Why are they always late? :l
---
Clearly waiting for me to come home, I’m already on my way!
---
I AM A FILTHY CASUAL THAT COMES BACK FOR EVERY DECENT UPDATE AND I AM OUTRAGED BY THE DELAY. 
---
ANET BETTER HAVE THE PATCH OUT THIS INSTANT OR GOD HELP ME I WILL ASK TO SPEAK TO A MANAGER.
---
Then leave and play something else, easy as that. And seriously, I laugh everytime someone says that GW2 is dieing, it's clearly not but you're just salty.
---
I MEAN DO THEY EVEN CARE ABOUT US
---
then make your own training group at a time that works
---
༼ つ ◕_◕༽つ gib patch ༼ つ ◕_◕༽つ
---
oh cool set looks interesting, thank you
---
mistake
---
CANCELING SUBSCRIPTION RIGHT NOW!
---
clearly you haven't tried
---
Yeah, I meant we deserve an expansion this year, after season 5. They said themselves that they've developed new technology that would allow for quicker living world releases, as well as they said they would be looking to make smaller, cheaper expansions. 
---
They CLEARLY haven't put that quicker-LW-tech to use, and maybe Season 5 will be shorter/release episodes much quicker, to make room for an expansion later this year. It wouldn't make sense for them to say they're going to make quicker/cheaper expansions, then have the expansion take LONGER to release than the previous 2.
---
Why do you care? Just because the content is not catered to you does not mean it shouldn't exist. Are you an idiot?
---
If you want a game specifically catered to ONLY you, either go play a single-player game of your choice...or better yet, make a game for yourself.
---
P I C N I C
---
just use arc lol
---
Btw he said learning, not training, that's quite different for me. He is saying to not fake KPs to join experienced groups to learn mechanics.
---
You don't need a real training but reading mechanics is not enough for being good at it. You need to see them and start to be confident. 
---
How you do this? Just create your own lfg for 100/99CM without asking for KPs.

I have no friends. But the game is not dying because the hardcore community is taking a break / quitting. This is a casual MMO after all.
---
SOUTH DIDNT KILL THE OCTOVINE!

---
I would imagine that's more or less how it will end up working, although which parts are character-specific rather than account-wide could go in a variety of ways. I doubt they will allow characters of the same class to share slots, as it would make additional character slots a more cost-effective way of getting more template slots than just buying them directly - each new character of the same class as an existing character would essentially give each existing character two new slots, plus start with two extras for each existing character. It would be nice to be able to share templates between characters in some way, but between issues like that and managing Soulbound items I suspect we'll just have to copy them around somehow.
---
buhu. cry some more
---
what is wrong with you
---
Can you give your preset as an INI files ?
---
[Come on ANet man, I need my dose](https://i.imgur.com/1Ipum9x.mp4)
---
Still get well soon, if its still relevant!
---
A lot of people gathered in the priory where we think the episode will begin
---
PVE reward tracks would be nifty
---
Think in usability terms for the average person ;)
---
Powershell would be nice, but there's a couple more steps for the end user. Maybe I'll make one at some point using this as my example. As I said, I didn't make it, but found it a long time ago. 
---
No, not really.
---
 oh yes you and quiet \^\^'  
---
Well, I can't figure out who my match is and missed the deadline -- hoping I get an email response letting me know who I need to send a gift to, even if it is a few days late. Anyway, considering this is the 3rd or 4th year I've signed up and haven't received anything... meh... I probably said last year I wasn't going to sign-up and yet I still did.
---
It's cool and creates momentum/hype. I didn't watch any of 'em but I know some people love it.
---
yea both are quite hard bosses for newer players, but glad you had a good time and got some experience in!
---
I will always accept inventory bloat over having to visit a random vendor who will undoubtedly be located in the worst possible place for no apparent reason.   
---
Even if the vendor is in a perfect spot, I still need to go there vs. being able to complete that part of my daily routine anywhere in the world thanks to perma bank.  
---
Worse yet, we how have inconsistency. Some gobblers are gizmos, others are vendors? No thank you. Just start expanding the tabs on the Ley Energy Converter, or build a new one that eats all the old ones, like the gleam of sentience. 
---
You can also just put gw2.exe -image on a loop. It won't run the game.
---
I worded that wrong, dont have to get butthurt, I didnt even want to play till a few days ago, I can afford to just buy it anyways.
---
Annoying how slow support is because all the wow refugees.
---
All my laurels went to legendary shards to get the new longbow lol
---
I said over 100, not at exactly 100.
---
yeah i gotta buy more, i've only recently had spare monies to burn, but i would stop at 5 alts
---
I use AMD, can't related to integrated GPU issues.
---
If you have 42, you'll probably be fine by the time you have enough map currency.
---
Not Art Wars tho
---
Exactly
---
I play Warframe for 1 year now. Devs there acually provide content for every player not some elitists that are proud of beeing better(raid community was and probably is right now). Thans for calling me an idiot. Golden rule doesnt work on this sub i guess.
---
new engineer specialization would be metaengineer
---
One thing with the API is that there is a cache that only gets updated every couple of minutes, so the batch script users may get staggered by that.
---
It seems they just scan memory, not disk, to find bannable programs. So, you should be fine as long as you aren't running them while playing the game.
---
if i have zero experience of fractals then i would start doing fractals in tier 1 and then move up when i feel confident to next and so on. If i want to join CM's i would join with friends or a groups who do not ask for kp. Might not be that we don't manage it or it take longer but that give me time to learn meanwhile. 
---
I am not against kp in group who wish for such. The lfg-tool is for all to place their group with what ever they want it to be. But i do think people overthinking fractals way to much which lead to players hesitating in doing them because they read here about kp and think shit i really need to be super good to make a fractal and never dare to try it. 
---
Other then mf exp boosters there's no other good use then turning them into gold and ever since pof made many mats nearly worthless .... yeah
---
still have 2500+ and spend at least 1k in the last years
---
Good thing they look like ass like any other non gem store skin
---
For chef one, the easy trick is to run next to it before launching, like... melee range. And memorize where each item is. That way is easy.
---
It's late!  GIMMEGIMMEGIMMEGIMME
---
Mostly CheatEngine should be the one to worry after. All that stuff you mentioned isn't even related to GW2 so I can't see a reason for a ban whatsoever.
---
The question you should be asking yourself is: does this program interacts with GW2? If not, you're safe If yes, then how.
---
I avoid them like the plague since they’re spoiler central, but it’s easy enough to just... not watch them. 
---
It’s great that those who want to watch them get them. 
---
Even while running those it would probably be fine.
---
Look up the April 2018 banwave and look for Gaile's response in regards to software they were looking for. You could also send in a ticket I guess
---
Is there a reason to why you must run them when you play GW2?
---
Ive straight up botted gw2 on my main and didnt get banned so i think your good dude lol
---
You could for sure put in a ticket and say basically hey I've got all these things, is anything gonna mess with me if I have them running. They will tell you 100%
---
But I want to say no as long as you arent modifying GW2 files. I mean overlays and stuff is all allowed.
---
None of those would ever be an issue, but you should avoid having memory scanners/hex editors open at the same time as Guild Wars 2 for prolonged periods, if they ever use that detection method again.
---
Gobbling gobbler gobblers gobbled gobbler gobbling gobbler gobblers.
---
...
---
Gobble.
---
Well, plenty of company if you did luck out for the third year in a row. I seem to also be lucky. It is pretty incredible that there are some people receiving multiple gifts and others receiving none, despite generous people like you sending lots of gifts.
---
build templates are already a thing and very easy to get. by allowing arcdps to have unlim build templates they have basically stated they dont plan on making them
---
Haha, I must admit I have missed a good couple months of videos, I come back and you sound all gruffly XD I wondered what had happened
---
I’m only annoyed because I convert them to mats monthly cause I have nothing else to spend them on.
---
Dam my money habits lmao.
---
ugh, im up at 4am and the patch hasnt dropped yet
---
.ini files are just text files. Just copy paste what I linked and save it as whateveryouwanttocallit.ini
---
Don't run anything alongside GW2.
---
These programms have nothing to do with the GW2 executable. To detect them, Gw2 would have to search your hard drive for such programs, which would be a pretty bad move. And even if it does, i see no reason why these would trigger any anti cheat detection.
---
Yeah I'm in the same boat, I blew all of mine for T6 mats since those were all I was missing for my Flameseeker Prophecies. I'm sitting on about 20 now so I guess I'll just prioritize the ones I really want first.
---
Nah, you'll be fine. If you're very paranoid you can make sure not to run them while GW2 is running, but it almost certainly won't matter.
---
Branded dredge. I dub the braedge.
---
Already removed it long ago since it crashes constantly in raids, especially at KC and Samarog.
---
The thing is it might be able to but I'm too limited in programming to know if there's a risk, modding it self might be considered a form of cheating since Mods alter the source code of a game, naturally if theres any of that functionality in what I have then that worries me.  I know you can shut down apps but the paranoid part of me worries what if there's something running in the background?
---
I'm overthinking this more than likely.
---
Reduce visible character models on screen. Keep everything else maxed. Should significantly help FPS issues. It's because the game is really poorly optimised and many players moving on your screen overworks your CPU. 
---
So in short, unless you're talking about when standing around in an empty area, it is normal. It's not because your rig is bad, it's the game. I have a RX Vega 64, 16GB RAM and Ryzen 7 1700X and lock my FPS to 60 FPS, it only drops below in WvW zerg fights, or World Boss events in PvE. But I also play with reduced player models rendered. 
---
My other setup with an i7 8750H, GTX 1070 and 32GB RAM is not performing any better.
---
Me: How much more miniatures do we really need?
---
Arena Net: A lot more!
---
Me: 🤦‍♀️ 
---
Can't crash if you don't play the game Steki
---
I grew older :^)
---
With knockbacks.
---
*Lots* of knockbacks.
---
Minis. Lots of minis.
---
I've left CheatEngine running (from flash games) with gw2 running and nothing happened. As long as they aren't opening the gw2 process in CheatEngine it would be fine.
---
Is login rewards the only source of laurels?
---
A fix for that got released days ago...
---
That's pretty much how leveling in mmos work. In gw2 however, you get exp from basically anything, whether it's doing events, heart quests, exploring the map, gathering, crafting...
---
Can't crash is the patch never drops...
---
[https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/go\_fuck\_yourself.html](https://www.wordhippo.com/what-is/another-word-for/go_fuck_yourself.html)
---
i had all of those for skyrim too (finally uninstalled the lot of it last month) and they didnt trigger it last time. from what i understand, they only scanned memory for app that could interact with gw2, not what's on your hdd
---
You are overthinking, but better safe than sorry so you're right to ask. If those programs modify only a specific game, then it should interact only with that game. In your case, I know those programs well ( I use mods too for lots of games ). They do not even care about GW2 program, and the GW2 program doesn't either.
---
If they're optional I'll just do like I did with the Istan weapons collection and cherry-pick.
---
Are you in charge of the wiki? If so, my hat is off to you
---
&gt;every MMORPG expects you to just do the generic "kill x enemy" or "collect x thing" quests by yourself, wandering from point to point on the map doing this stuff, until you hit end game.
---
Generally speaking, yes. At least in GW2 you're given options, you don't have to do a long string these things to reach end game.
---
&gt;I tried doing this with a friend but there's no depth or real reason because I never needed to call for heals, and there's no co-op abilities or any real strategy. Is the endgame radically different?
---
Yes. The coop feel you seek is mostly in fractals and raids. GW2 was mostly designed to be soloable, or I should say this is mostly is the case now with todays MMOs. Back in the day people were forced to cooperate with others to progress and people hated that for multiple reasons. Like not having the time to play or wait to organize, not getting along with randoms, pace, etc. I'm surprised you didn't like FFXIV seeing as that's much more coop heavy than this game.
---
Yeah, but since other companies are practicing bans even if you just run CheatEngine, I'd just not use it during an online game.
---
Still crashed at Samarog yesterday.
---
Tormented and branded themes are incredibly close:  
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gallery_of_Tormented_weapons  
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Margonite_Reaper.jpg  
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:The_Shatterer_original.jpg  
---
Some closer than others, most branded not even close to the Margonites... But the implementation of themes is very similar.
---
Cool it with the name calling there a bit there Ragnarok.
---
gw2 doesn't have a kernel mode component so it can't "scan memory".
---
Istant has probably still has one of the better afk farm spots, tho i almost dont see any one at the usual spot anymore since 3 weeks for some reason (prop the GM who cleaned up all afk farmers who didnt replay and they didnt go back)
---
I dont miss LS patches :pepeGenius:
---
I made Flameseeker last year since I was going to be maining a Guardian at the time. Unfortunately, now I only play ranger so it feels like a waste :(
---
Although the hearts are similar to quests in other MMOs, they are not the primary form of leveling content in GW2. Doing world events (usually marked as orange circles on your map) is usually more fun and rewards more XP. Other ways to level include PvP, crafting, exploration, and even gathering herbs/ore/logs.
---
Just go for lots of damage. The grind up to 80 is a bit slow and not as much fun as the variety of stuff you get to do at 80, so you just want to speed it up as much as possible.
---
On that note, food + utility consumables can give you a percentile xp boost (halloween food is best if I recall correctly) and if you're in a guild you can get a 24 hour xp boost from the bartender, then there are regular xp booster items and I think leaving an old map via the dialogue it pops up gives you another xp boost for 10 mins. Those are the things that really matter at low levels.
---
Thanks
---
Yup, this game feels way more alive than WoW has to me these last couple of years. 
---
I'm gonna buy a black lion key to compensate for the money you're not spending
---
You can get it from achievement rewards as well iirc. /wiki always helps.
---
At least I'm not the only one in the "drained of laurels" boat lol
---
I had GWAMM before i even reached 40 HoM points lol. Still haven't maxed it.
---
Yes, but will they log off once they get the skins as well. What about the other mats they need? 
---
If I'm remembering correctly, it would have been somewhere in the gap between Kessex Hills and Lion's Arch. There are presumably other coastal towns along the Northern and, so a lesser extent, Eastern coasts of the Sea of Sorrows, but Risen attacks probably would have destroyed many of them and the scale difference between lore-Tyria and game-Tyria make including the few that might remain difficult at best.
---
atleast 30 mins
---
If only the skins were worth the trip to the vendor. Kappa
---
REEEEE PATCH IS LATE IT HAS BEEN TWENTY-SEVEN MINUTES ARENANET WHAT THE FUCK
---
Can asura see better in the dark than other races, since they used to live underground?
---
GW2's not just the right choice, it's the best choice. The whole idea is that you hit level 80 fast and then have a buffet table of content to play through, a little something for everyone and much of it based around exploring, story, achieving, facing challenges, etc.
---
**Or** we could just have a vendor. You know, do it like everyone else does it, how it's immediately intuitive for players coming from other MMOs? Not be the special snowflake game for once?
---
But you really can't. They sell abysmally slowly.
---
no surprise. people are finally realizing an hour's worth of content you play once every 4 months and never touch again is nothing to be excited about
---
Calling it now it will be the classic three skritt in a trench coat.
---
Don’t get me wrong I love the show and it is pretty funny to see deroir and Brazil argue constantly
---
\- From everyone at the Durmand Priory rn
---
That must be the only case of a gestalt becoming a single NPC in gaming history.
---
IM CRYING AND REFRESHING THE LAUNCHER EVERY 1MIN WEEEHHHHH  
---
Probably won't be late at all. They have another 14.5 hours to get it out before it's late.
---
When should the patch be out ?
---
Looks like you need all the exotics to unlock the ascended set, though.
---
CMs really aren't much harder than regular T4.
---
Well it is over an hour late.... as usual
---
Longtime RO player here, I can say that there is much resemblance of GW2 elite specs to RO (reborn) classes, except GW2 elementalist is the superior version of RO mages and mesmer an entirely unique class from the MMO classics. Don't expect to haul around a healer ('priest') for your general gameplay. They are very situational. There is no healing pot system but the food and utility buff are decent to maintain a good level of personal buffs.
---
genius explanation :o

&gt; # 01/08/2019—January 8 Release Notes
---
&gt;
---
&gt;## Living World
---
&gt;### Living World: &amp;quot;All or Nothing&amp;quot;
---
&gt;As her allies fortify themselves for the final confrontation with Kralkatorrik, Aurene prepares to face her greatest fear: her role in Tyria&amp;#39;s future.
---
&gt;### New Legendary Weapon: Pharus
---
&gt;Call down pillars of cosmic energy and conjure arrows made of pure light with Pharus, a new legendary longbow with mysterious origins. Its creator claims they were guided in the weapon&amp;#39;s construction by a previously undiscovered entity, but it seems more likely that this bow has humbler (if no less unconventional) beginnings.
---
&gt;## Fractals
---
&gt;### New Fractal: Siren&amp;#39;s Reef
---
&gt;Shipwrecked and surrounded by an army of ghost pirates, players must work with a crew to break the curse that grips the isle of Siren&amp;#39;s Reef.
---
&gt;### Mistlock Instabilities
---
&gt;We have overhauled Mistlock Instabilities and added new ones in order to promote a more positive gameplay experience. In addition, the frequency of certain instabilities has been adjusted.
---
&gt;### Existing Instabilities
---
&gt;- Adrenaline Rush: When enraged, enemies deal 150% increased damage while they&amp;#39;re low on health. Enemies deal 20% less damage when not enraged.
---
&gt;- Afflicted: Outgoing resistance duration is increased by 50%. Enemies apply random conditions.
---
&gt;- Flux Bomb: You are periodically afflicted by the anomaly&amp;#39;s flux bombs. Flux bombs apply to both allies and enemies.
---
&gt;- Hamstrung: Low health increasingly slows your movements. Endurance regenerates 33% faster.
---
&gt;- Last Laugh: Enemies explode upon dying if not stunned. Stunned enemies apply protection and stability to nearby players.
---
&gt;- No Pain, No Gain: Enemies receive boons when hit. Stripping an enemy boon will steal their life.
---
&gt;- Social Awkwardness: Players will be pushed away from one another.
---
&gt;- Toxic Trail: Enemies leave a path of poison behind them. Blocking a toxic-trail attack will absorb it and cleanse the condition.
---
&gt;- Mists Convergence: Repeated spawns have been eliminated, and two new possible spawns have been added: an ally, and an abomination that will attack ally and enemy alike.
---
&gt;### New Instabilities
---
&gt;- Boon Overload: Each boon on a player increases incoming strike damage by 5%. Outgoing boon duration is increased by 20%.
---
&gt;- Frailty: Players are smaller and have 30% less health, but they move 25% faster.
---
&gt;- Outflanked: Foes within a range of 300 do 300% damage when attacking from behind, but only 75% damage when attacking head-on.
---
&gt;- Slippery Slope: All surfaces are slick. Outgoing stability duration is increased by 20%.
---
&gt;- Stick Together: Take 60% increased damage when not within a range of 300 of an ally. Take 20% reduced damage when within a range of 300 of an ally.
---
&gt;- Sugar Rush: Increases player movement speed and attack speed by 15%. Elite and lower enemies&amp;#39; movement speed and attack speed increases by 35%.
---
&gt;- Birds: Birds of prey periodically assault players. Dodging transfers the birds to nearby enemies for 4 seconds.
---
&gt;- Vengeance: When enemies die, they enhance nearby foes with multiple boons; does not apply to elite foes. Strip any enemy boon to inflict them with weakness.
---
&gt;- We Bleed Fire: Enemies create flaming missiles when damaged. Incoming condition damage is reduced by 20%.
---
&gt;### Aetherblade Fractal
---
&gt;- The number of consoles used to disable the grid traps now aligns with the number of consoles used to disable the spinning laser traps.
---
&gt;- Adjusted the activation threshold on the laser traps.
---
&gt;### Deepstone Fractal
---
&gt;- Added warning rings to the Deepstone Sentinel&amp;#39;s tornadoes.
---
&gt;- Reduced the defiance-bar time for the Deepstone Sentinel&amp;#39;s wind sprites on tier 1 and tier 2.
---
&gt;- Falling or being dropped from the platform at the Deepstone Sentinel will now put fractal tier 1 and tier 2 players into a downed state instead of killing them.
---
&gt;- Adjusted the functionality of the Voice&amp;#39;s Shadow Siphon skill. The defiance bar now scales with tiers, and the barrier will drop when the defiance bar is broken.
---
&gt;- Reduced the number of safe falls that are available in the Voice&amp;#39;s chamber. Tier 4 of the fractal has been reduced to 1 (from 3), tier 3 has been reduced to 2 (from 4), and tier 1 and 2 have been reduced to 4 (from 5).
---
&gt;### Twilight Oasis Fractal
---

&gt;### Bug Fixes
---
&gt;You&amp;#39;re not seeing double! As mentioned in the November 13 release notes, the Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlock was going to receive a significant update, but a bug prevented the changes from happening. The bug has since been addressed and the previously scheduled update is now here. Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlock changes include:
---
&gt;- The maximum rarity for equipment skins has been increased to exotic, and many older exotic items have been added. Future updates to the wardrobe unlocks will continue to add older exotic items beyond this initial set.
---
&gt;- Over 600 new items have been added—mostly weapon and armor skins, but new dyes, gliders, outfits, finishers, and minis have also been added.

&gt;We have overhauled Mistlock Instabilities and added new ones in order to  promote a more positive gameplay experience. In addition, the frequency  of certain instabilities has been adjusted.

I Told You So.
---
hell her she needs to up her fashion wars.
---
It's mentioned in game during the Vigil arc of the Zhaitan story.  It's the town where Warmaster Forgal Kernson's family lived before being destroyed by the risen.  And that's 6 year old story, so definitely doesn't qualify for spoilers anymore lol  
---
My impression from the in game story was that it was either a fairly large/important city/port or that the attack that destroyed it was large scale for some reason.  I personally only know of the risen having sent one of those super special scout minions (only seen once ever in game) before the attack on LA, but I could be wrong since I've never read the books and because we really don't see much of that kind of thing explored in game.  
---

I am interested in discussion. It just turns out whenever you read something you don't want to hear it's cynical. 
---
Anet doesn't stick to their word? How dare you be so cynical! 
---
Anet says they'll be faster in response to being continuously lower? Proof that S5 will be even better because anet said so!
---
Yeah but in reality that hasn't happened? Still too cynical!
---
Covering your eyes doesn't actually make the world around you dissapear, and it certainly doesn't make you invisible. But you might just be able to fool yourself, which is the point I suppose. 
---
Looks like the leak on new/updated instabilities was right. I’m super excited to see how these play out and if they put restrictions on some instabilities being active at the same time. 
---
Join a guild. They will help you with directions and tips on almost anything.

YES QUALITY OF LIFE
---
&gt;Flux Bomb: You are periodically afflicted by the anomaly's flux bombs. Flux bombs apply to both allies and enemies.
---
Still looking forward to seeing if this spawns "friendly" bombs on the enemies or not.
---
Be careful, don't want to cut yourself on all the edge up in here!
---
&gt;    Adrenaline Rush: When enraged, enemies deal 150% increased damage while they're low on health. Enemies deal 20% less damage when not enraged.
---
Previous version of Adrenaline Rush was 50%.
---
This is going to *break* the bosses. Just saying.
---
&gt; We Bleed Fire: Enemies create flaming missiles when damaged. Incoming condition damage is reduced by 20%.
---
Oh boy
---
First she needs to teach me sum fashion XD
---
Late? Where did you see an announced release time?
---
HERE WE GO BBIES
---
I was expecting this to be last years patch notes.
---
Yes, I was just deleting it because I saw someone posted 2 minutes before me :D
---
Ty!
---
Focusing on mostly mishaps and mistakes **is** being cynical though. You act and speak like Anet has done nothing good in the last year. It's so childish and black and white that it's just a waste of time to even get invested in this.
---
So while you make a tantrum on reddit, I'll be busy having fun with the new patch.
---
They haven't announced any time of release...  
---
Patch isn't live?
---
&gt; build a new one that eats all the old ones, like the gleam of sentience.
---
Best solution: a Converter tab in the Hero panel. Unlock new converters as you earn them. Zero bloat, all functionality.  
---
It would also serve as a new avenue for rewards. 
---
I guess I got spoiled by the rapid cadence of late, but I'm a bit sad there's no balance changes :(
---
Pretty sure invisible content is still loaded in, just not the art for it. So if it was just layered, then we'd be loading those layers whether they're seen or not. That would increase load times, especially when a location has many instances.
---
But do you have insider insight on how they create instances? You're speaking as if you had personally watched them make story instances or at least were told how they do it.
---
Yet previously you said "it just makes sense". So which is it. Do you know, or are you just "best guessing". If you're just best guessing, stop saying it as if you know for certain.
---
Instances, both story instances and the other, seem to only utilize the map itself. Interactive objects aren't persistent among variations.
---
it is 2019 btw
---
&gt; I don't mean it as a criticism. 
---
Hah! I do. It feels a bit repetitive as you're levelling up. MMOs as a genre usually have a bit of a grind to them, and I'd say that GW2 is actually one of the least bad offenders... 
---
If you like massive group quests, you will **love** Heart of Thorns. Everything about it is more of a challenge, but the maps have very active metas running pretty much all the time. Hop in on one of those and you'll be golden. Also, look on the LFG for world boss trains, often early evening... they involve a lot of travel, but you'll spank some dragons with a squad of 40 other adventurers. 
---
There has been a slow shift from map chat to the subreddit and the forums for guild advertising. Divinity's Reach and Lion's Arch are probably the two main cities for map chat and guild ads, though.
---
Is...Is this all?
---
They already said Season 5 is coming right after 4
---
They never talk about expansions until they are ready and its not normally a team lead who talks about expansions its usually the Game Director.  
---
These new instabs are cancer Jesus Christ
---
-facepalm- I did the thing where I wrote the wrong year in the title.
---
&gt;still living in 2018
---
It might be a misworded, and they meant "deal 150% damage".
---
Oof.
---
I think the very worst part:
---
100 people who are commander/1v1ed a god/took down an elder dragon
---
Vs
---
1 human champion
---
Cmon. 
---
Just trying to keep the peace.
---
wasn't there suppose to be a balance patch?
---
Ever hit the point when you see a word so much, you question if it's spelled right?
---
I've hit that point.
---
its up!
---
Usability?  You can't make a powershell script executable, so that it would take a double click just like a .bat?
---
No damage done, nobody can understand german language anyway.
---
2 thumbs up for this change!
---
Chrono is dead.
---
&gt; Blocking a toxic-trail attack will absorb it and cleanse the condition. 
---
***Laughs in Firebrand***
---
you looking forward to kebos?
---
I'm the studio liaison, which means that I work with the community of the wiki. The wiki is the work of editors who are players like you, so I'm now the one you should thank :)
---
[Right after update.](https://youtu.be/Bmgqjz_qX4Y)
---
It's not even an hour "late" and they also never announced an exact release time. It's generally 9a.m PST give-or-take some time because it's a big ass patch, not a gemstore update. 
---
Now it is
---
Did they repaired 24 and 28 slot bags binding to character?https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a75w13/psa_dont_equip_2428_slots_bags_if_your_character/
---
It's a pretty big patch.
---
Yep!  I will continue to not do Fractals until Anet deletes instabilities.  These new/reworked ones are soooo much worse than the old ones.
---
You clearly have no clue abour OS architecture. [Read this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/gettingstarted/user-mode-and-kernel-mode).
---
Now, in simple sentences:
---
 - Any user mode program can query a list of running processes using a Windows API method
---
 - Any user mode program can query the list of its own DLLs using a Windows API method.
---
 - To actually *directly read memory of another process* you have to run in kernel mode. There is no Windows API method for that in user mode.
---
I'm locked in time machine, help... :(
---
Can't say for sure how successful some of these instability changes will be, but I do like that they tried to give pros and cons to each one, rather than just a negative interaction for every instability now. 
---
I'll be optimistic, but I fully expect a SA/ST combo that is going to drive me insane.
---
This is gold.
---
Anet ben be like:
---
y'all mind if i make fractals worse?
---
I assume the damage from flux bombs would damage enemies as well as us. Should know soon once people run into it.
---
Where are you getting this from I have read this post and no where does it say anything like there isn't another season for the foreseeable future. Anet NEVER EVER talk about future plans if you were expecting a massive bomb of season 5 starts in 2 to 3 months you are kidding yourself. I'm not being mean but you see its the finale of this season and don't see news on a future season and jump straight to we aren't getting a new season for a while please read the post as it is.
---
Old habits die hard, as it would appear. 
---
Not just that, but Redbull has a huge presence in the gaming market in general. And as games and e-sports grow, they want to make sure they're at the forefront of it.
---
hell of a lot more than this patch, that's for sure
---
&gt; **Social Awkwardness:** Players will be pushed away from one another.
---
&gt; **Slippery Slope:** All surfaces are slick. Outgoing stability duration is increased by 20%.
---
&gt; **Stick Together:** Take 60% increased damage when not within a range of 300 of an ally. Take 20% reduced damage when within a range of 300 of an ally.
---
Uncategorized and Chaos are gonna be fun when these are around XD
---
It's only January, we forgive you.
---
That’s what happens when you have too many ales! 
---
What hype?
---
holy f**** i just spent all my laurels to sell mats like 3 weeks ago nooooooooooooooooo
---
@100kb/sec :(
---
Watch it, only 2 more months of that being totally normal.
---
&gt; The Iron Beast Greatsword skin and the new Roaring Dragon Glider skin are available as uncommon drops.
---
Any videos on these yet?
---
Anyone got download size?
---
Even big patches happen at that time mostly.
---
Is this the last episode or not?
---
[me rn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qg9awRP7jMU), [also me](http://i63.tinypic.com/pyrgk.jpg)  
---
.-.
---
No, and we just had one four weeks ago.
---
same lol
---
It's almost like content that lasts for longer than an hour is better or something
---
Oh man, I thought we were getting new gear stat combination. I guess my chrono gears live another day.
---
Well, legendaries are long term goals. Wouldn't be very legendary if they were easily attainable by everyone. Besides, getting legendaries kind of invalidate all the other skins you've gotten in the same category (at least it felt like that for me).
---
If they don't do flat damage (which is what I'm guessing looking at the second line) it should be ok. Resistance and tons of condi cleanse should negate it. Firebrand, anyone? :D
---
So...what I just said
---
How in the world...
---
[Time to ~~fix~~ change your language settings](https://imgur.com/a/WU6kXps)
---
such a cool idea but i got like 20+ chars......
---
what gift was for the gift of pharus?
---
Shooshadoo is more expensive and less crafted by players. If you want to be original make shooshadoo as it is easier to find 10 players with FSP than 1 with shooshadoo.
---
This is very significant!
---
weird flex but ok
---
You haven't even played with them yet and you're already pushing them off?
---
gratz! I'm still loading the patch in snails pace... But I'm planning on doing the same ;P
---
&gt; Boon Overload: Each boon on a player increases incoming strike damage by 5%. Outgoing boon duration is increased by 20%.
---
Lmao
---
Maybe. But they're also more fun now... 
---
It's a bit below 1.3 GB.
---
I got the Iron Beast Greatsword the other day from a BLC. If you don't find anything let me know and I'll see if I can cap a video of it later on when I'm home.
---
your chrono is ugly
---
So... not directly then.
---
Me, who just converted my 90 laurels into T4 mats for gold/legendary crafting: D:
---
Can't wait for Toxic Trail x We Bleed Fire x Boon Overload
---
I'd say this won't happen because shared inventory slots.
---
I don't mind hard content as long as its fun. 
---
dhuum cm = fun
---
arbitrary inconveniences that destroy the record scene due to lack of consistency and a daily system that railroads you into 3 fractals and discourages fractal tours like the pre-hot days = not fun 
---
The truth is... the game was rigged from the start.
---
I wish that statement was true.
---
I'm so proud of this community
---
It doesn’t say anything about the diviner’s gear. Did that not get released?
---
And now do us a favor and check if there are new stat combinations on it :-) 
---
At 55 a month you’d have them before the next release 
---
Ok. Thanks for sharing.
---
The most well known ones from GW1 that existed at launch were all dropped underwater.  Some of the lesser known ones stayed above ground but were changed and trashed mostly beyond recognition. :(
---
Amnoon was just changed beyond recognition, which isn't unreasonable for a functional port and 250 years.
---
From what I can see, the previous instabilities got a bonus/penalty set and/or some active counterplay. I'm eager to see how it plays out.
---
It's the little things that make the best of life.
---
SO MUCH THIS. As a partially color-blind person I have wanted this since release. Sometimes the number overlay and icon colors are too similar for me to see the numbers.  I've always resorted to moving the items to my inventory (where the tooltip has ALWAYS shown the stack number) to see how many I had or used 3rd party API systems like GW2 Efficiency.
---
Thanks so much Anet!!
---
Agreed, they look like they might force players to actually mix up their strategies, which I'm all for.
---
Wow, congrats! I bet you feel a sense of pride and accomplishment? (Please post art that your gf made of your character with the new leggy)
---
That will probably be where it ultimately lands. Knowing Anet's balance team's history, I wouldn't be surprised if it really is a 150% increase in damage at this point.
---
Wait what? 6 a year? Meanwhile we get 1 in 9-10 months 😂😂
---
There is no such thing anymore.
---
OMEGALUL
---
I believe many GW2 players have a heavily modded Skyrim and several modding tools installed (it's my case, I have regular Skyrim, Mod Organizer, LOOT, TES5Edit, SKSE, Wrye Bash, FNIS...). If Anet were banning people because of that, we'd have heard about it.
---
that's not a mesmer weapon!
---
&gt;now
---
NOT
---
Diviner's confirmed with the expected stats, available on legendaries.
---
Don't make me repeat 2018... T-T
---
Thats... All...? :-) 
---
SUPERFLEXXXXXX
---
Grats! Your dedication is something
---
Yeah, that combination could be... interesting. Presumably either they aren't allowed to show up together, or the SA range is a fair bit shorter than the ST range, if not both.
---
My question is: did you whale all the other legendaries you have or grinded the sht out of the game from the very first release back in years ago?
---
Oh man, you'd *love* WoW:TBC. Gearing up was like preparing for rave party.
---
WOOD  
---
what else would it be for just a strong and proud legy  
---
Oh is that the chainsaw blade? I have that one. More curious about the glider. 
---
Fastest toilest flush in the West!!
---
Presumably available through new LW episode as well, but can't easily check at the moment.
---
They had this super helpful Overwatch article once. I was stunned that they themselves wrote it.
---
Inb4 he has insider info about the next expansion. 
---
And /only/ cherry picking what you wish to believe, rather than what is founded in reality is delusional in the opposite direction. Except I'll defend my points where as you refuse to and hide behind non-reasonings. See how this works? ;) 
---
I did not say /anet didn't do anything good/. For simple example, I think W6 was a very good raid. But I'm not going to claim their raid releases have improved when they went down to 1 a year. That's called perspective. 
---
But you refuse to do this. Nothing negative can be discussed or it's /too cynical for me to read/. I said anet's content and releases are declining rather than improving. You stated the exact opposite; and you weren't willing to defend this opinion past "too cynical" and "can't talk to you cause you're not positive about my favorite game". 
---
If you look across the scope of the game rather than cherry picking positive examples you'd probably notice the same. This is not the same as "saying anet hasn't done anything good". But can't argue because... well you can't argue at all. If something is negative it must be wrong and cynical :) 
---
So while I ... afk through another LS episode I'll realise it's actually more fun to reply to these posts and see what kind of BS you come up with than listen to more mediocre unskippable dialogue. Surely - if there was varied content I'd much rather play that than bother stating we're unhappy we are with the game. Except that's not allowed, which only makes it more fun. I'll continue to spread some bad breath left and right because to plenty of players, the decline is very real... And because it's more entertaining for me personally than whatever you consider good gameplay. (How exactly is it gameplay if all my attention and keystrokes go into this reddit screen rather than the GW2 screen, and yet i'm magically progressing... Weird! I gotta be really fucking good at this - wasting my bad breath on the subreddit actually lets me progress ingame. I suppose that should make me feel good and warm about my achievements... Hype?) 
---
Keep up creating an environment where you'll only cherrypick the stuff you want to hear and neglect everything else. I'm sure it'll create the utopia you're clearly desperate for. Certainly won't make things worse ;) 
---
&gt; The maximum rarity for equipment skins has been increased to exotic, and many older exotic items have been added. Future updates to the wardrobe unlocks will continue to add older exotic items beyond this initial set.  
---
Time to buy up all of the cheap exotic skins! Could also get precursors and very valuable exotics from this too, as well as some collection armor like the PoF/HoT armor sets, Invisible Boots, Aether-type weapons.
---
&gt; Feathers of the Zephyr Package
---
It's back! Been waiting for this!  
---
Even got a small stack of weekly keys to get a few more statuettes. :3
---
Kralkatorrick dye pack worth?

---
Hang on, g as in Giga? That's pretty substantial even for a LW patch if my memory serves me correctly. I wonder if there are some surprises they didn't mention in the notes rolled into the release.
---
Yes.  It was in the preview videos yesterday and all my legendary gear has been updated to have Diviner's.
---
Oh man, I'd be down for that!
---
I can’t wait to play, especially if there’s going bugs and glitches ☺️
---
&gt; Golden rule doesnt work on this sub i guess.
---
Oh, but it does...at least for me.
---
If I act like an idiot or say something idiotic, I expect people to point it out (if I don't catch it myself)...though that is quite unlikely to happen, because unlike you or most people in general, I make a conscious effort to not be a hypocrite or exercise in-group biases...instead of getting my feelings hurt.
---
This is part of the Black Lion standalone weapons collections. It looks like the old Halloween Chainsaw GS skin, but it's a bit different. You can see a still image on the wiki, the inner and outer teeth move and steam comes out of the hilt area.  Pretty neat actually. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Iron_Beast_Greatsword
---
I saw sworn zaishen helm available again and stopped reading. Weeeeee
---
Season 5 is before expansion
---
Hmm that depends on how many episodes season 5 is going to have. If it's full 6 episodes that gives 8 releases plus expansion in a year which is nope, new tech or not.
---
Even with new tech and less episodes i just don't see expansion this year in any way. Faster production ok, but you can make new releases only so fast 
---
They've been pretty consistent about LW patches being almost exclusively about the LW episode and associated content, with balance patches coming in between LW releases.
---
This is correct. If a bomb spawns on you, it belongs to you and does 2500 damage per tick to enemy NPCs (while still hurting allies). Pretty much an irrelevant change as you'll want to drop it away from your group anyway (and the damage to enemies is worthless).
---
i mean maybe taking a break and playing something else would do some good.  I've scaled back on my regular play recently to start going through my steam backlog again.
---
Whats "Annoying"? That you have to work harder? 
---
I dont agree. Instas are cool, they add to the  challenge, the new instas sound great. they will add some new spice to fracs, I love it. I am sorry you dont feel the same.
---
Try some other games. They can also be fun! 😍
---
bugged final fight on the first mission. the endboss isnt spawning again after the first phase.
---
So even if you craft a legendary in 2 months with some "minor farming" 36 legendaries takes 6 year to complete.
---
Hmm, guess not then. Maybe the new weapon unlocks? 
---
Hey, noob here, where can I get these? Are these permanent?
---
You mean sigils?
---
How do you do it? I buy heavy crafting bags and sell what's in them. The maximum I gold I got was 75% of the amount of laurels but mostly it's around 50%.
---
yea if you only pve it's gonna be boring af. 
---
There were also pretty clear statements by Ireno implying we'd see more balance changes around boons (who brings what) that would come with a new gear type to support such. Since Diviner gear was announced for this patch, people made the reasonable assumption that we might finally get the balance patch that has been needed in PvE for 3+ years to shift the Chronomancer/Druid/Warrior meta with the previous changes of sigils and skills being foundational.
---
It might not have been reasonable to hope for that in hindsight but the balance in this game really needs fixed.
---
Used in crafting the precursor for Pharus, not sure if anything else
---
I dont agree with adding virtues. Mechanically they are kinda boring. The elite specs make them way cooler. 
---
The recipes for those are known  though, they require "exquisite serpentite jewels", whatever serpentite is.
---
Yeah, if you do it on the side. If you're nolifing it you can craft one every 2 weeks easily.
---
He actually did it, the madlad.
---
Ah, there we go. So it won't affect 99% playerbase. :)
---
Anyone got screens of the miscellaneous mace and shield for those not at home?

That's not the point. It wasn't released at 9 PST. That's the point.
---
How many chests did you have to open??
---
Brandstorm is amazing!
---
You can get 55 every 28 days so 85 isn't that big of a deal ...
---
This is also one reason why I avoid using timegated things to obtain ungated things
---
They started using them again when PoF released
---
I would love a Power, Healing Power, Condition Damage and Vitality combo.  Marshal's is great but I don't care much about precision.
---
Just sold arcane for 200g, I mean it does look pretty but why would anyone spend so much for just one dye?

They stopped doing legendary collections ages ago, after the first four HoT legendaries. It's all a crafting material sink now.
---
They stopped adding those with Eureka, back in early season 3.
---
Anet only had collections for the first 4. They ran out of time, so the next 12 are just gold sinks. 
---
No. Newest legendaries require just crafting and mats are almost identical.
---
Legendaries now are only material/gold sink. If you have the materials ready, you can instantly get it
---
2k hours lol.

Aurene died sacrificing herself to save the player. No hope for resurrection due to her soul essence being shattered.
---
Still a boring story 
---
Bruh. Endgame.
---
Oh shit that explains it then, besides nevermore which others have collections?
---
I'm pretty sure more people co legendaries than raids :)
---
let's hope!
---
In the new fractal, all allies and enemies became invisible after the maze.
---
Living World Legendary Weapons only require an insane amount of materials, no collections, only weapon specific shards. People crafted shards, and then transformed them in the mystic forge after the patch dropped. This way they could craft the precursors in a matter of minutes. They probably had the mystic tribute and the maguuma mastery ready. Hope this helped you.
---
No, there hasn't been in years.
---
Arguably arcane is the most unique though. The others have *tons* of similar dyes
---
Hi all - so I last played GW2 back in 2012 and I am tempted to start back up again. I'm keen to crack on with some Fractals - the Fractal Zero to Fractal Hero is my reading for this week but it's filled with a lot of terminology and basic things I don't get having been out of the loop for 6 years. Do I need to buy and complete the stories of the two expansions in order to do Fractals? I'm pretty out of my depth but going to pick it up!
---
&gt;2051786_0076	Dragonsblood Spear 
---
This is in the datamine.
---
Don't care. Didn't watch.
---
Definitely. Even though it's not my favourite, good to see some originality for sure.
---
They're usually not, no, since the chance of getting basic common/uncommon dyes are really high, and no guarantee of getting the good dyes. Just buy them outright off the TP, but wait for prices to settle a bit first :)  Unless you really like gambling then go for it.

Home instance node not appearing at vendor for me
---
nothing for fractals? :( No weapon? No infusions? 
---
shots fired
---
2 dye slots, is in the later half of the video
---
Better than Kung Fu tea though aye
---
Apparently. They keep releasing new ones.
---
Only 5 for me but it is pure RNG
---
yes it is. gw2 grind is only for fashion
---
Oh no... it's an Ulduar mount set.  
---
It is not arcdps, enabling then disabling a new instablitiy in the training arena (fractal lobby) causes everyone in the instance to crash. Same goes for Reset All Parameters.
---
Astralaria
---
Chuka and Champawat
---
HOPE
---
Nevermore
---
Dragons blood sword goes with it very well
---
Nevermore, HOPE, Chuka and Champawat, and Astralaria are the only Gen 2 legendaries that have a proper crafting collection.
---
We know that around the time of the last expansion they created a dedicated expansion team that has been working on the next expansion ever since the last one released.
---
We don't have any idea if that expansion will be coming out soon, or if there will be more content released between now and that expansion though. 
---
thanks, had no idea
---
I love Arcane and Crystal, they seem like they're going to be awesome as highlights on my Mirage. &lt;3 Shattered is also nice, but it reminds me of one of the Glint dyes.
---
They almost never release balance and major content at the same time.  The inevitable bitching about balance changes undermines a lot of the positive PR from a content release.
---
Thanks. Looks like they'd be Franok's weapons. Wonder if we can get them as like a continuation of the desert highlands dwarven weapons.
---
also in ls3 trinkets so no hard grind for those.
---
These are not great. 
---
All of gen 1 legendaries, hope, astralaria, nevermore and chuka and champawat 
---
we know, season 5 is coming next
---
Wow, that is so awesome!
---
Uughhh why did they add the stupid particle effect. They could have looked so good with leather armor only.  
---
  
---
Severly disappointed.
---
Locked: Please use the [Bug Thread](https://redd.it/adx8ul).
---
GW2 is designed to be an on again off again game, since there's no subscription and content releases are patterend every few months. I tend to revisit on new releases, and in down time I go to other games, sometimes other MMOs so I only have one MMO sub going at one time.
---
I'm so happy.
---
This is it. Out of the hundreds of comments, he actually answered the question himself. Thanks!
---
They follow the rule based on the crafting profession needed to make them.  Weapons needing Huntsman = Wood, Weaponsmith = Metal, Artificer = Energy.
---
Any plans to update traits/skills to make more use out of the new diviner's stat combo ?
---
Can think of quite a few that could be tweaked or moved to make the meta allot more flexible ?
---
cant see sprites in fractals. not even enemy health bars are moving.
---
HELP
---
LOL same boat as you OP.
---
same here, perhaps it unlocks another node than intended :D
---
Agreed, where are our leafy mounts ANet?
---
OK that's good to know it isn't my build. I haven't really benchmarked my pc with any other games besides Runescape (Lmao). I'll try that out when I go home thank you! 
---
Qadim Fight seems bugged. The Magma Elementals in the 100% - 66% Phase are invisible and it also seems you cant push/pull them. 
---
They had to do something else, since the drink will eventually kill anyone who drinks it.
---
They put this on the wrong thing.
---
Needed to be Griffon Mount skin. PepeHands
---
You're new, so that means really pick what you find to be really cool and enjoyable before thinking about endgame. And only like 5-10% of endgame actually requires specific gear builds and classes. Here is my quick run-down of each base class, from my perspective of course.
---
- Warrior. Fast paced, hard hitting, can take some damage, uses almost every weapon in the game, but isn't flashy and you lack decent ranged options. The nice thing about GW2 is you can use dual axes and a greatsword in combat versus the same enemy without need to open your inventory, just press "`" in combat and you swap weapons!
---
- Elementalist. Flashy, fun, impossible to kill and can deal high damage, but is squishy and has a lot of buttons to press. A good choice for a second profession IMO if you feel up for having lots of tools but also needing to know where they are. Give it a try if you're up for a challenge, but know it will be tougher than other classes.
---
- Thief. If you like stealth and hit-n-run style combat, you'll like Thief. Squishy, but with tools to prevent damage, and very slippery in combat. Requires some sense of what is around you, but is also super fun to play when you get the hang of it as you can't be hit and can hit hard.
---
As for the other 6 classes, I would take a look into Necromancer and Ranger if you're brand new and haven't even finished downloading the game yet. Warrior and those two are the best for beginners as it lets you explore the combat system while also being very forgiving and gives you time to master the dodge rolling system. Hope this helps!
---
Just a PSA, black lion chests are still not worth it, don't waste your money.
---
That is a nice looking mace. Reminds me of wow's crystal draenei mace whose name I don't remember, but less over the top.
---
So no changes to traits/skills to make more use of the diviner stat combo ?
---
Guess there is always hope for the future.
---
I hope this is true. I really enjoy grinding the new living world stuff, but when they throw in curve balls like Sigil of Nullification, is sorta ruins my drive to play the game for a while.
---
On gw2efficiency u can check the prices
---
Iirc last time both medium and ...light? Were the most gold efficient!
---
Thanks Anet for something for the Norn!! :,D
---
ban this person
---
My life has improved today.
---
Tbh it will just help the people who dont drop them away from the group, which I'm for because pugs always drop it directly on the mobs and they only pull like 3k dps.
---
raid is just a waste of time and who is Teapot ? 
---
Also raid community super toxic. 
---
So we'll need 13 of them if we choose to make the new legendary. Holy shit, this is even bigger than nullification sigils. I can't believe they've done this!
---
Cliff side slip and slide bumper cars inc!
---
As stated - you don't want discussions and will dismiss anything you don't want to hear with non arguments. Thanks for the entertainment ;) 
---
Bruh..
---
 but that's too much  
---
He was just a complex bot. Unfortunately there was a bug in the system and he started asking some questions that were a little too sentient for our liking. It was all or nothing for him so when we refused to answer the nature of his existence he deleted himself. We've lost a start to guide us. 
---
Imagine Sugar Rush on Urban Battleground, those warriors will hit you so hard they'll disconnect you.
---
I have different way to do it. It's girlfriend at home.
---
Be aware, very low drop rate. 
---
There’s only one green mark, and it is in the new map... so how do I get there? I’m now at some random old map and have no clue at all
---
r/woooosh
---
He hasn't heard the news? Idfk, either living under a rock or bug. 
---
The mystic forge is the converter. Just because you’re too lazy to use it doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. 
---
think im up to 136th one. I forget. GZ
---
The vast majority of my raid experience has come from RA. I've consistently found it to be a great place both for learning raids, and improving once you've got the basics down.
---
If you're thinking about raiding, even a little bit, and ESPECIALLY if your reasoning for not wanting to raid is "You don't have the time" I recommend giving this a shot. : )
---
Great group of people.
---
Heres a bug, 72 hour ticket with to get my authenticator fixed, can we fix this now that the patch is out so I can actually play the fucking game.
---
Picked an interesting time for Chrono training especially with new gear stat coming out. 
---
Diviner's stats not available on Mist Band
---
115 keys in...no glider...ANeT why u do dis!?
---
They changed the default setting of the music settings, which may have changed your settings somehow. Double check that sound is on there?
---
I'm pretty sure this happened back at Ember Bay, so this bug has turned up on a regular basis for as long as it possibly can
---
I've yet to try out fractals yet today, how does it interact with stability? Stability has increased duration so does that mean that you won't slide while you have it active?
---
this one sounds pretty generic, I like the part from the trailer where choir sings fear not this night
---
Ive spent over 1k on this game, get better support shouldnt have to wait 72+ hours for a simple fix.
---
Also not selectable on my envoy precursor either, but i'm not sure if that's because of when I got it
---
feelsbadman 15,5k
---
I don't know  whole lot about [WvW](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_versus_World) (tl;dr, large scale PvP mode), but typically you'll be in a good-sized group with a [Commander](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Commander) and a lot of other players. Regular warriors don't tend to be the high-priority target, I don't think, but opposing groups will be damaging a handful of people at a time.
---
tl;dr, you likely won't be the focus in a regular WvW zerg but you'll get pretty banged up; just stick close with the group, listen to the Commander, and remember that getting [Downed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Downed) isn't a definite loss
---
As for PvE (each game mode is separate of the other), Warrior has some great survivability &amp; damage. Good healing skills to pick from (you can swap freely out of combat once skills are learned in [Training](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hero_point#Training)) coupled with defensive skills (like your [Stances](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stance#Warrior)) and great weapons for damage (dual-weilding axes and greatsword, for example).
---
Like shard said, though: Necromancer, Ranger, and Warrior are the best classes to start the game with.
---
Can’t get to the new map for the next quest dragons blood, wasn’t teleported to the new map at the end of first mission so
---
Literally unplayable
---
Is this referring to the murder hallway?
---
Same in the CM. They are invisible/invincible. Fight is currently unplayable.
---
Put slight spaces between the pools.
---
I never knew I needed this, but I don't think I wanna live without it anymore!
---
I’ll give someone 50 hard earned gold for an arcane dye
---
No one cares what you spent, quit whining like an entitled child.
---
Yes - it's confirmed Power/Concentration major, Precision/Ferocity minor. I believe Full Diviner's should equate to...  
---
    +1173 Power
---
    +1173 Concentration 
---
    +633 Precision
---
    +633 Ferocity
---
Or, in other words, a nerfed Berserker's that also gives 78.2% Boon Duration by itself.
---
Have now opened 108 chests. Still no glider.
---
I maxed out the music and didn't play any other form of music , still got no sound.
---
It's amazing, I love everything about it. I don't think I've ever had so much trouble doing Underground Facility as with Slippery Slope.
---
The Miscellaneous shield looks like the logo from Legendary Pictures. 
---
maybe take a screenshot to show us where you are so we can better help you get to where you need to be.
---
Yeah just figured that out, im stupid, thought it was buggy af.
---
What's 200g when you have 20,000g and an account full of Ascended / Legendary geared characters?
---
Sorry im new why are people mad about the patch it looks fine to me. Though i only just got my first charter up to 80 
---
Yeah but pugs!
---
Did ArenaNet say anything about the next add-on? I came to my ears that they will continue with Season 5 after Season 4 but is that really true?
---
I haven’t done the new chapter yet. However I used the portal time book on a character, intending to go to Jahai, and she went to Thunderhead Keep instead, bypassing the story.
---
"Charge crystals with veteran mobs" achievement, third vet doesn't spawn (playing solo).
---
Nope, you still slide with stability on you.
---
It's always funny to see things like vacation, parental leave, retirement contributions or professional training listed as "perks" in US based offers.
---
Steelstar insigina from weapon vendor is the diviners ascended.
---
I am currently at a Norn beginner map, where I was dropped at after finishing the three trails and exited the glint lair instance, 
---
And my next mission is called dragon’s blood, described as ask someone about the new map, and the only green mark on my entire map is the one at the new area above desert highland, and I have no idea how I can get there. I double checked there is no other green thing on my entire map so I’m stuck kind of..
---
Plus, quit and replay the episode didn’t change anything.
---
Nope I don't have to reread it thanks. The devs do give some context, quite often so I could only assume the poster was asking for everything to be explained, because some stuff is explained. 
---
Yeah, I've yet to receive any feedback from the creator/host. At this point, I'm thinking it's always been a ruse and they're grabbing free money using alt accounts, but then they're some legit gifters/giftees. It is what it is.
---
i just did a straight line throught the fence, worked for me.
---
Warrior is a heavy armor class, and has one of the highest health pools next to Necromancer. Even in gear that has zero defense, you can still be tough to kill if you dodge and use your heal skill at the right moments. Plus, if you really want to, you can use Longbow or Rifle for ranged engagements, though the Longbow is best for dealing damage over time (Conditions, such as bleed and burn) and Rifle does mediocre damage at best. 
---
If you're playing strictly PvE, you'll have no issue as a Warrior. Aggro is based on toughness (toughness is converted into Armor) and as a heavy armor class, you can forgo a little bit of toughness for vitality (health) or other offensive stats. 
---
Lastly, the game is built around cooperative play, so if you see someone killing a tough mob, you can help them out, get credit for the kill, and loot, and so will they. Buffs, called Boons, are also easily shared with other players, see skills that say "Number of Allies/Targets: 5" and use those. Best example for Warrior is [For Great Justice!](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/%22For_Great_Justice!%22), a shout that gives you and nearby allies Might (increase in damage) and Fury (increase chance to critically hit for bonus damage), so there is no need to be selfish with those skills.
---
As for dying, in GW2 you enter a downed state when you lose all your health. While in this state, you have access to 4 skills (5th later on but that's not important at the moment). For Warrior, skill 1 is a simple projectile damage skill, skill 2 is a projectile that knocks the target down, skill 3 pulls you out of the downed state for a few seconds, but a drawback of being completely dead if you don't get a kill or the trigger chance doesn't happen, and skill 4 is a long-channeled self-heal to bring yourself out of downed state, but is interrupted by damage. If you lose all health in downed state, then you're fully dead and need to waypoint to revive, or wait for a kind soul to come revive you. If you score a kill in the downed state, you're immediately brought back with medium to low health. 
---
I think the simplicity of Warrior is probably your best bet for getting a hang of the game, especially later on when some mobs can nearly 1 shot a Thief, but still take a few hits to take down a Warrior in the same type of gear. 
---
While I agree that mixing and matching is always better, they need to put something on the gem store and since not everyone has PoF or HoT outfits are always a good idea.
---
Plus they've started giving us some actual armor sets as of late! We got "two" last episode and there's a new piece of the corsair set every second episode so that's good. The Elegy/Requiem armor set is even decent-looking, getting rid of skirt/trenchcoat/buttcape after \_years\_ of the community pleading for it!
---
I really feel like we're reaching a somewhat good balance between armor sets and outfits.
---
Same! I didn't know the value of laurels back then but hey, still a great buy.
---
in the final instance, I fell into and got stuck in some rubble.
---
there is no way for me to /gg or die, so I can not get out and I imagine resetting the instance is the only way to fix this.
---
So Aurene fake dead for now (she'll probably get resurrected), Taimi no progress on her death, and Kralkatorrik no change. Time to wait a few months.
---
It goes well with quip
---
Thanks for the link. Found this as a reference in one of the profiles: "Performance and Pipeline Engineer for Unity 3D iOS Games".
---
So i guess it is a unity based mobile project
---
Your idea was much appreciated, the prototype was a lot of fun and led to what we have now :)
---
walking down that first set of stairs made me feel like i am about to rekindle the fire. I love it!
---
That actually sounds likely since they already support Mac. But I don't see them porting GW2 to Unity. In general I wouldn't have thought that they want to ditch their custom engine. We often talk about spaghetti code but if you ask devs about the engine they mostly seem to like it. 
---
They literally told us that it was going to happen, how was there any shock for you at all.
---
Oh ok, sorry if me asking seemed rude i was just curious. I hope you're well now and your Charr truly is awesome!
---
"Pact Marshal ..."
---
:D
---
"... Outfit"
---
D:
---
Just fuck off, it would have been an amazing armor skin.
---
1.2GB
---
I can also confirm that Healers and Assaulters raid rings that I got last week have Diviner's as a selectable stat. Mist Talisman has Plaguedoctors and Harriers, but not Diviners. My envoy armor has Harriers, but not Plaguedoctors or Diviners
---
Idk, you have to dedicate almost all of your free time to do it in a few months I think... I mean, been there, done that, it's a long grind. I'm at 4 weapons 2 backs 2 armor sets, not that you asked but I answered.
---
Hey /u/that_shaman ? I know you generally try and exclude overly spoilery stuff from these, but do you know why this patch is so massive (1.2GB) ? It's far larger than normal. Is something special coming? Don't need to say what - Just a yes or no :p
---
I have to agree. The design is perfect for one of my characters... but the particles aren't. :(
---
I was going through the updated wardrobe unlock and saw this. It doesn't have any name and uses the bandit slicer icon.
---
If you're talking about the visions from the episode before than yeah it was surprising because I honestly thought that they'd pull something like us miraculously changing our destinies. As I said I believe we'll either meet her again in the mists or resurrect her or something but still I thought they handled this pretty nicely.
---
ArcDPS already updated 
---
It took us longer to complete underground than it did 100CM. 
---
Some achievements, like the timed achievement in the last story instance (Crystal Circuit Racer), are only available for the instance owner, making it annoying to play together through the story and get achievements.
---
Crystal Circuit Racer as well, only available for the instance owner.
---
Ok thank you!! This is great info. I have a few questions about what you've said if you have the time -
---
So Agony Resistance is like a gear stat? And I can get those gear items from low level Fractals?
---
What is Mistlock? What does that mean?
---
I don't remember if GW2 has a LFG feature but I'm guessing it does? I'm sorry, I'm away from my computer right now so can't get on to look.
---
Thank you again!
---
Where do you buy these skins if you want em?
---
I'll definitely look into this. Having played necro for 6 years, I've been trying to make new classes to learn and this sounds like a great chance.
---
That's been in the wardrobe since the release of Mythwright Gambit. It's Qadim's War Gavel, a mace that's mistakenly duplicated and labeled as a sword.
---
When is new stats coming out?
---
Thanks for the spoiler disguised as something else, like seriously dude where’s your head at. 
---
Technically it’s not a spoiler no, but now I will play the patch tomorrow expecting some main character(s) to die. Not cool.
---
It was released as part of today's Living Story update. :)
---
Pulling a way to save her out of our ass may have been the only way they could have written this episode even worse.
---
Tested.... LMFAO!
---
Maybe ArenaNet is trying to stress the importance of maintaining stability when slippery slope is active? Instabilities are meant to force players to adapt and change their gameplay, or else fractals are just a grind every single time. Maybe you'll have to take a bit longer than before, lose some dps, but just take some stability (or bring a class that's good at giving stability like Firebrand
---
Just end the processes of the other apps and make sure that nothing against the ToS is running in the background while playing GW2. If you're unsure, only run GW2 with, at most, discord and a browser window open if necessary and nothing else.
---
Just make a point to log in before work then quit.
---
So this means bank now holds stacks of 500 instead of stacks of 250?
---
Awesome! Looking forward to it. What professions are you most interested in unlocking/making?
---
Unity screams phone shitgame.
---
inb4 Guild Cards
---
Remember to keybind
---
They're working on a mobile project. Given Diablo Immortal and today's announcement of Alien: Blackout, I'm prepared for the worst.
---
If you don't want spoilers wtf are you doing on reddit.
---
I'm sad and angry at the same time ;\_;
---
I kind of agree with you about there being more armor sets as of lately, but personally i wouldn't dislike if they did more armor sets - even as gemstore items, as they once used to. I would have totally bought that logan outfit had it been an armor set instead (it kind of reminds me of the gray warden armor from dragon age) 
---
Then git gud
---
Oh fair enough!
---
For statics, sure. For pugs who couldn't care less, nope.
---
RemindMe! 92 hours
---
Isn't this only possible if the target was spawned by `CreateProcess()` of the master process that attempts to read it?
---
and the inevitable bitching about the lack of balance changes doesn't have the same effect?
---
He probably bought a [storage expander](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Storage_Expander) off the gemstore.
---

Oh yeah, a gem store armor version of that outfit would be an insta-buy for me as well.
---
It also causes your hits to do an extra strike
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Impossible_Odds
---
Follow the gift from first gen legendary, Kudzu needed gift of wood, so here you are.
---
All other stuff are mostly the same for every 2nd gen leg weapon (except the one with collection)
---
Double benefit, then - it will force players to communicate and plan with each other!
---
In all seriousness, it is possible that the added complexity will make playing with PuGs a bit tougher in the short term, but people will adapt like they always do.
---
You can Buy material storage expanders for gems to make room for more Mats 😁
---
it was late, so people were freaking out, then it comes out and all is right with the world
---
&gt; a perfectly good laurel sink since you can get T6 mats for them
---
Gold.
---
Gold, gold, gold. Everything is gold, including gems, almost all legendaries and even raid CMs; and gold can, essentially, just be bought straight away with a credit card.
---
If all currencies can be converted to gold and not much exclusive else, what's the point of all those currencies in the first place? Expac/LS map currencies at least have limited supply and require you to play that content specifically; laurels slowly stockpile by themselves from you playing in the game as a whole, so it's natural for them to be used in an exclusive vanity reward system that reflects long-term commitment... instead of another source of universal gold.
---
I don't get why he didnt just turn his head just simply killed us while we were preparing the crystalls.
---
You were supposed to walk through a portal with Caithe and Aurene at the end of the trials instance and that should drop you in the new map
---
Instructions say to hit Reset, did you try that?
---
I doubt it but I hope it includes your guild bank.
---
Eh, if I were going to use the dragonsblood sword on him, I might as well use the dagger too.
---
I try to keep him all plant based.  He's very purple-themed too so Caithe's daggers work great.
---
You can reset mist trinkets for 250 shards of glory.
---
It's also on Chaos, Cliffside and Deepstone today. I took 13 minutes trying to get up those narrow planks at the start of cliffside. 
---
I guess this enforces the chrono meta!
---
Where can I find that setting? I just upgraded to 10.
---
Im wondering tho how we'll get Aurene back, because we can't kill Kralk without Aurene absorbing the magic ond his death.
---
How'd you get all 9 characters to be logged in at once? Most I can get is probably 2 if I'm fast enough to switch.
---
&gt; 2056705_0541	Dragonsblood Bolt
---
...is also confusing. Whatever these two weapons are.
---
I don't even feel like having fun on the new map anymore or trying the fractal... I think I won't play gw2 for a few weeks
---
Arcane is amazing, but I think Fear will work nicely with the Binding of Ipos.

Guild Wars 3: Coming to mobile.  
---
\^/s
---
Oh man that charr mesmer is ADORABLE. AAAAGHGHSTHPHTPSHTPS
---
If I end up buying this pack, that will be the main reason. 
---
Friendly reminder that we still have a sidestory that contains timetravel/riftwalking, so this is probably where the next LS will go
---
Wow didn’t know you can remove that tag. There could be a bunch next to me and I wouldn’t even know. That’s cool. 
---
this is amazing
---
Boi, you've gotta be pretty depressed after all those years then.
---
Fuck having non-static gameplay amirite
---
You might as well wait until it rotates into the Statuettes at this point
---
"Don't you guys have phones?!"
---
Enrage happens at 5% and it barelly does anything xd
---
now i can't unsee how much luck i have in bank, sigh.. where's my gobbler? 
---
genuinely feel empty
---
Perhaps but the sequence isn't depicting that.  Last image is an angry mob about to burn down the village.
---
Found an more annoying entry: Ironfist
---
Problem is that it looks the same as Ironfist(basic hammer) but Ironfist itself doesn't even provide the skin so it is just diluting the pool of skins. :/
---
There is also a second Etched Short Bow. &gt;_&lt;
---
Slippery slope in fractals is a freaking clown fiesta, just like I thought it would be. :( What is it with desire to screw up movement for player character, as if tornadoes in TO were not annoying enough :(
---
bad for me, it's a financial source of income for me :(
---
Same issue for me. Own all home nodes, can’t see this on the vendor. Guild mate who doesn’t own them can see it fine. 
---
welp, guess there is another way, but this is not the way
---
Was excited doing the story stuff.. I finished the last story, stood around for a while and just logged out =| 
---
My kind of monster.
---
I know. I added the last step. everyone was freaking out in map chat when the patch was only five minutes late
---
Well rip me, I guess I'll go for 3-4 weapons.
---
Attempting to use portal to Jahai ports me to Thunderhead, or disconnects from the login server. Seems like a 50/50 chance of either, 0% chance of getting to Jahai. 
---
Maybe try to use a ‘teleport to friend’ to teleport to the new map if all else fails. I’m sure someone will be nice enough to party up to help you
---
Just did a straight line from the tank to the flame through the fence, definitely works.  I just stood next to the fence, places oil on both sides, then went around and kept going.
---
I already have
---
No regrets, only fuzzy raptor hands
---
I *think* you might be able to use `OpenProcess()` as well.
---
Yeah, would be really great to not being able to use these skins on your medium and light armor characters, because it would be a heavy armor....
---
Outfits are good as they are, cause they are filling a gap. 
---
Calling the ability to using skins without being bound to the armor type "crap" is just stupid...
---
The reason makes sense but the support response is a head scratcher.
---
&gt; "associated with other accounts which had been hijacked and used as part of a botting network" is extremely cryptic. Was my account hijacked and botted on without my knowledge? What does associated mean?
---
That is what it looks like they are saying but "we won't help you recover the account because it was stolen and used for botting" is a weird response unless they are also implying that you were one of the people responsible for the actual bots and theft of accounts.
---
Excellent storytelling
---
It's not.
---
Looks cool but it's weird how the PC is gliding inside the dragon. I would have liked it better if it used the sitting or riding positions (flying carpet, forged glider) instead.
---
Apparently it’s not supposed to be active on Cliffside and will be fixed next patch according to anet response on forums
---
Anybody else getting contact crashes with send error report while in Thunderhead Keep? Happens every 15 seconds the game is literally unplayable.
---
This was some real Guild wars:Endgame shit. I was floored.
---
Been salvaging cheap exotics for skins for a while; wondering now if this addition actually watered down the good stuff or somehow made chances better.
---
Got it, and my next question was if other mist trinkets are affected as well; sounds like that is the case.
---
No.  There are a few people here complaining about no balance.  
---
The last several balance patches have had various parties for various reasons filling up the entire page with multiple threads complaining about why XYZ was nerfed when ABC should have been buffed.  Or how this change or that change has ruined the game forever.
---
How can you be shocked? Anyone could have seen this coming from a mile away from the second that thing was introduced. Wow what a riveting plot twist and emotional story. Build up a relationship with your buddy dragon only to have it taken away from you. There were hints all along the way. This is a children's story level of writing. 
---
High quality as always in BLC. But no matter how nice those weapons are i will never never never ever buy keys. The biggest waste of money there is in the game. 
---
These are the updates I live for
---
Every mount skin with particles should give you the option to turn them on and off :(
---
To make those people who don't usually gamble gamble.
---
grab on the pitchforks, now we riot.
---
put it on the fence and 2 on each side
---
12,853 here :P 
---
These look great, except for the snow particles. No buy.
---
Agony resistance is given on infusions, which are items that you put inside ascended gear 
---
So you could have a zojja's visor with a +9 agony resistance infusion for example
---
Mistlock is just a name for the fractal features. Mistlock instabilities are just changes to the regular fractal experience that change daily. So for example, one instability occasionally sets an AOE bomb off at your location, or another will make everyone smaller and faster, but with decreased life.
---
And lfg can be found by pressing y and going to the second tab, where it is then split up into categories. Fractals has it's own category, split up into the 4 difficulty tiers
---
Indeed, looks very weird with the static character body inside the moving dragon.
---
The post https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65249/bug-slippery-slope-cliffside-and-underground-facility#latest just for reference.
---
I was crestfallen when I saw her like that, but then I remembered. Did she not literally just eat King Palawa Joko, the *immortal* lich? We know she could open the mists from the scant power from Balthazar she absorbed and we know Elder Dragons can use (to some extent) the powers of the others' who's magic they've consumed, so what's to say that she didn't gain Joko's supposed immortality?
---
Hey! Which classes are mostly in "vogue" now? I had a Druid I was building up 2 years ago. I think it was fully geared in ascended for healing, but I'm not sure it's still the BiS for raiding. I also suck at healing with my druid, so I would greedily accept tips and help to get better at it.
---
But I also loved reaper in raiding at HoT release, but I know necros are not really favorite anymore, any good alternative to dps/condi dealer that's fun to play (not engi). I do have an ele but for some reason, I can get good with ele, often downing since it's such as glass cannon build.
---
I'll be sure to tune in this week-end!
---
I've already got 13 kills on my belt, mostly escort, Vale Guardian, Keep Construct and Gorseval, but I've been doing it very casually.
---
Wait, what's going on?  I'm at work and can't log in.
---
Guild Wars 2: Rytlock’s Critter Rampage now on mobile
---
If its possible to get aurene back, ima go out on a limb here and say its got something to do with the aurene brand on his face or some shit, just to make it difficult
---
Thread removed: Spoiler(s) are not allowed in titles, feel free to re-post this without the spoiler in the title.
---
That's the joke, they don't test this shit. 
---
Thread removed: Do not use this subreddit to try and contact the customer support.
---
&gt; Your bond with Aurene has granted you the ability to launch off of mounts.
---
Hooray! I've been waiting for this.
---
Oh no how unexpected the story that is happy in killing every major character killed another major character? Didn't see that one coming at all guys /s
---
That's not how this works 
---
Wait, our planet isn't called 'Murica?
---
Yeah..put the spoiler in the title..
---
\*laughs in Blink\*
---
cuz that wouldnt be epic enough for anet, they had to give us hope till the last cutscene
---
Anet. Holy fuck. Oh my god did they outdo themselves. Maybe a little too much. Everything hurts, I'm going to just lie down on my bed forever now.
---
I'm floored. Hits right in the feels.
---
Judging from the industry, that wouldn't even shock me.
---
just go through the fence and not around it at the south reflector
---
yup and it still didn't work
---
I also think we're going to get her back somehow, ANet knows that we all like her, that's why they killed her in the first place. But we'll our pet dragon back... At least I hope.
---
I'm sad you're getting downvoted like crazy.
---
The thing with this bow is, yes, I agree that it looks nice from up close, details are pretty neat, it does get the simple elegant thing I'd say.
---
But to be honest, for a legendary, that costs SO MUCH in this game, this is not worth it. They couldve easily put this in to game without the foot effects, and honestly, noone woulde thought "Wow, this is a legendary quality bow, why are they selling it as a black lion chest weapon whaat!" 
---
When I grind my way through money and sources, I want something different, more visual, that makes people go "WooOooah" 
---
When I started this game me and all of my newbie friends were drooling over most legendaries, especially how crazy Dusk and Dawn looked, It does take your eye.
---
Noone would turn their head and say "Wow! Is that the new legendary lb, looks so good!" In the game.
---
Well, even if he was a fallen god and is dead now, he was strong af. 
---
Also it's a phrase humans in Tyria say all the day. Think of it the same way as people in RL saying "oh my god", even if they are atheists and/or actually don't include any god in that phrase.
---
Yep. Without the snow effect and the runey splash when you mount these would have been an insta-buy for me, as I've been after this sort of mount skin for a long time. As it is, I'm unsure.
---
I guess I'm shortsighted then
---
Same
---
[Hey look, it's here](https://i.imgur.com/c6VA4cC.png)
---
I don't know...
---
&gt; They said so, it can't just be PR bullshit! Anet would /never/ do that to us!
---
It's ON THE TABLE!!!
---
Is it because they're already done with the new content? ^/s
---
Diviner's Stats not selectable on PvP ascended gear.  Unintentional I assume, as all other PoF and LS stats are available.
---
Isn't it the other way around?
---
Checking out non-spoiler stuff like Pharus, patch notes and the new instabilities because I’m hyped but can’t play? 
---
You brought up a second good point, actually. The mists... Maybe I'm just grasping at straws, but if we ever end up in the mists, maybe we'll meet Aurene, dead/alive/joko'd. Maybe she doesn't need to be 'alive' to kill Kralk?
---
I can't add Jahai Bluffs scroll to 4 season portal tome or is it bug from previous patch?
---
I'm not sure if I'm missing anything, but I previewed wardrobe unlock and it still showed yellows and greens I hadn't unlocked
---
Yes it is. Stability exists outside of WvW. 
---
* 500 Gems per roll, 11x for 5,000.  SSS rare Rytlock speedo unit available until 1/31/19.
---
I'm at almost 5k hours and 18 characters. You can take it easy. Just play for the content, stop going for the grindy stuff if it burns you out. Like, I love going for a fractal with guildmates once in a while, or just doing an AB meta run (I never get tired of this one), or just do some map completion while watching a movie... If you just do the boring grindy stuff everyday, it's normal to get burned out.
---
Play what you find ENJOYMENT in.

I agree with what has been said about good artistic value of the current visuals, but my personal problem with GW2 is lack of details everywhere except from core popular spots. It lacks high, dense grass fields, real forest with a lot of vegetation, and different kinds of small living things, like birds, insects, little fishies in the pond. Yea, sometime you may see one of two kind of such non-monster creatures, but that's not enough to create a world which feels like it's alive. That's one of the biggest problems I have in mmorpg games - their worlds seem dead and sterile. There is nothing alive except players and monsters specifically placed to be generators of money and experience, walking around in stupid, random, meaningless patterns. They don't even interact with each other, or with the environment, that much, except from occasionally attacking each other. You can't suddenly bump into two Raptors playing with each other, or a flock of monkeys throwing stick at a Stalker below their trees etc. The creatures in a typical mmorpg act only as a simplistic walking target for players passing by. This totally kills any immersion over time.
---
This is one thing I would like to see improved, together with adding more details to a typical map, not just some textures getting more hi-res, and better shaders. Simply making it look slightly better won't improve experience this much. I.e. moving into the direction of Monster Hunter World, with sort of simulated biomes which live their own complex lives.
---
achievement hunting was more fun than i expected it to be
---
Nice one, that makes sense. Thank you! I have full exotics on my warrior I think, so I'll just work on picking a good build from the resources here and then running the lowest level Fractals. Thanks!
---
Gem Store Gacha will include SSS rare 5* Rytlock and Logan speedo units.
---
Take this shit down before the patch it 
---
Is this SAB world 3?
---
I'm sure your parents must be proud of the cringe you brought them
---
It's their first time that they have achievements in an instance, anet will do better next time!
---
Are there any retry options in the first instance?
---
Do it
---
This, I always looked at Aurene as a Deus ex Machina tool, sort of like Taimi. But when I was getting ready for this fight, damn son, I felt it in my bones.
---
8,900 hours in, I'm only at 30 skins. I'm proud of you OP.
---
Unpopular constructive opinion? TIME TO DOWNVOTE.
---
It's okay, at least when the next episode drops, we can pretend we didn't see the deus ex machina coming.
---
Oh, no thief nerfs! A good step forward.
---
Thanks. I might go for soulbeast / daredevil maybe as options for dps... I often die on my ele, preferring to use it in open-world and fractals for now. But I'm definitely interested in learning druid and possibly the soulbeast and daredevil. I'll see if I can get in this week-end. Much appreciated.
---
Anet has released that it is a bug that Slippery Slope appears on Cliffside and Underground and they plan to fix this in a later patch. 
---
[Reference](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/65249/bug-slippery-slope-cliffside-and-underground-facility#latest)
---
I mean, if you really want to play the game, but just don't feel that satisfied doing it alone, I guess the next step would be trying to find some people you enjoy playing with. A guild you feel comfortable in, with people who are active and want to do things together, that's usually a solid motivator for at least logging in to see who's on. After all, the social aspect is a huge part of online gaming.
---
Or was shown that aurene could rebrand kralka branding. Maybe she "infected" kralka. And will take it over and soon we will have big aurene. 
---
This has to be the most random, half-kittend instability ever...  It makes no sence as a 'mechanic'. Cliffside is impossible without portal + blink.
---
This just has to be removed 
---
Maclaine Diemer said in an interview this was his first time working with a choir, and was very worried, but I think the result is quite phenomenal.
---
Long Live The Lich Aurene, amirit?
---
What I'm willing to bet is that Aurene isn't really "dead" but rather, she is somehow living inside Caithe. 
---
Then she bursts out of Caithe's chest like Aliens and be like "Reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
---
Thank god..
---
I half-expected Master Chief himself to come charging through
---
lmao don't worry, they're going around commenting on every positive post to prove how edgy they are.
---
Lol not many people know this, I have that blurb saved in my clipboard and have been pasting it on every thread I find people complaining as long as no one else has said it lol. 
---
no roller beetle :/
---
[removed]
---
Omg these are amazing and perfect for my rping needs. 
---
Welcome to the game!
---
There's a lot of really friendly people in this game that can help you out with larger bosses/achievement, give tips, or find a guild. Usually there's a mentor tag (red apple tag on minimap) that is helping out with the map events. Some of the larger world events will have Commanders running around, and they'll mention on map chat what color their emblem is. 
---
I personally run a thief main - It's my standard go to for any game, so it was always going to be my starting character.  I really enjoy bouncing around as the daredevil which is the Heart of Thorns level 80 profession. I'm quick, dodgy, and able to stealth heal \[as well as heal/res other focus in stealth :)\]. The downside is that I'm really squishy, but there are some builds to help alleviate that.  I ran solo for quite a while as a regular thief and didn't have too much trouble until HoT hit, so it's definitely viable for PVE.
---
Warrior Greatsword &amp; Dual wield Axes is pretty fun. And super durable with the high health pool.  i don't play this as much though because I prefer the acrobatics.
---
Never could get the hang of elementalist, but everyone has their strengths &amp; weaknesses. I know a couple people who love this profession.
---
I suggest picking the one that sounds the most fun to you and just going with it. If you don't like how it plays, you can always try a different character. What do you like playing in other games?
---
 The physical **body**, which is a complex system of bones, muscles,  organs, nerves and blood vessels developed for optimal interaction with  the environment, follows standard natural laws and patterns that, while  different between species, are similar to all animal life on the planet.  It has been stated that, broken down to its basest components, the  average adult human body is comprised of Water (35 L), Carbon (20 kg),  Ammonia (4 L), Lime (1.5 kg), Phosphorous (800 g), Salt (250 g), [Saltpeter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium_nitrate) (100 g), Sulfur (80 g), Fluorine (7.5 g), Iron (5 g), Silicon (3 g) and fifteen traces of other elements.   
---
Now what would a teenage dragon be in ingredients, and where can we draw the pentagram?  
---
woah
---
&gt; a bug in the system 
---
No no, that was episode 2.
---
&gt;This concluding episode has also created a point of reflection for ArenaNet. It’s a chance to take a step back and see how the concept of Living World has grown and developed over time and evaluate how it has succeeded as a storytelling technique in the unique world of MMORPGs.
---
The quote that has people confused since other websites imply otherwise.
---
It's pretty standard; when JB first released, you couldn't put the Scroll in the Tome. They later fixed it, but it appears they rebroke it; perhaps a bad Copy/Paste job, as people are reporting that the JB Scroll is sending people to Thunderhead instead.  
---
Give it a few hours (or hotfix patches), and it'll get sorted out.
---
Here's hoping he didn't get it so he has more time for gw
---
Or... treat your authenticator seriously?
---
Save your seed code etc.
---
Am I the only person who just doesn't care about these minis of characters? Give me more pets with hats and mustaches! Give me a 500 gem character addition to have TWO PETS. 
---
I mean, yeah, of course SOMEONE is gonna kill Kralk or put him to sleep eventually. Unless GW3 plays purely branded field and everyone is dead, Fallout 76 style. 
---
I agree with you and yet I can top your unpopular opinion: I'm glad they killed her off. The story became so predictable. We are always succeeding. And yet now not only we do not beat Kralk, he manages to kill off our only hope of maintaining balance of magic in Tyria in case another dragon dies - Aurene. I certainly didn't expect that and I'm glad they did it. 
---
So when a "After 6 years , playing 20mins per day and I crafted my 1st legendary" makes a post it's an impressive achievement but when Nico makes one it's a flex ? Hmmmmmmmmm
---
I think he is plenty big, I mean we saw his head and neck the rest of the body gotta be absolutely massive. Also a little glad he isn't bigger. Not sure all computers would be able to handle the fight.
---
All I can say is that I successfully predicted that Anet is gonna preserve Kralkatorik as the last Elder Dragon killed.
---
We have yet to finish off Primordius and Jormag, and Steven is still at large.
---
We have 3 dragons to kill before Anet would let us take down the big bad guy.
---
Shame that they decided to throw Aurene in as a sacrificial pawn for this chapter because they somehow wrote themselves into a corner by building Kralkatorik's threat level to the point where he had to be dealt with or Tyria would be destroyed.
---
So the solution was Episode 5 : We wound Kralkatorik enough that he cannot continue his Mist eating shenanigans, but in exchange, we give the bad authors Aurene. 
---
A part of me wants to believe that Aurene is way too important for the plot, she can't just die like that. Surely, we will find a way to resurrect her, right? *Right?*
---
Also, I cried like a baby.
---
If you are using laurels to buy trinkets you are not doing it right. The rubies / winterberries / pearls are much easier to come by and not useful for much of anything else.
---
Social Awkwardness + Slippery Slope + Stick Together, this is what actual hell in a video game is going to look like.
---
Also, if I was being particularly uncharitable, I could say something like "wow, only Anet can try to rework instabilities and literally proceed to make them worse", but let's face it, zero MMOs have developer team that knows what they are doing in terms of basic balance. 
---
Instead I'll just say whoop, Anet refused to listen to listen to feedback on instabilities and fucked it all up, not much of a surprise.
---
Lets hope they keep her dead, otherwise this whole scenario was waste of time.
---
I miss read that as utilities thinking like a facilities position.
---
Tirabikkr can be heard across the entire map.
---
FINALLY, KILL TAIMI NEXT, AND THEN BRAHAM
---
&gt;Oil
---
I combined 9 screenshots to get this image. I made a screenshot of each character individually. I explained everything somewhere in this thread XD
---
I recommend you stop being a dick :D
---
&gt; Think of it the same way as people in RL saying "oh my god", even if they are atheists and/or actually don't include any god in that phrase.
---
Coming from a non-theist, exactly this. :P
---
Completed the story and 90% of the map with no lag or crashes
---
same, upvoted for visibility
---
Audio cues from the different events in the Thunderhead Peaks plays from anywhere across the map. Can get quite grating after a while.
---
Exquisite Serpentite Jewels don't have any stats.
---
The earlier zones could use a little polish, but the newer stuff is pretty current, even with the older engine.
---
Definitely need to do this. 
---
Uhh, quit work or the game?
---
It didn't work for the Elric brothers, and it won't work for us either.
---
oh its on.. i'm dead a coming pistol pistol
---
Theres a skritt riding a pig on the new map. Do I need to say more ... :D
---
it's not price gouging if the demand doubled, while the supply remained the same.
---
It's simple economics.
---
Don't purchase them for RP, unless you have a reason your mounts are all magically generating snow from their fur. The particle effects ruin some amazing RP-friendly skins here.
---
The audio was in and out badly on mine with music. But overall I cried as well. Wasn't expecting that. 
---
He's mad op hates skritts
---
Other games use public test servers for a reason. They could do it to but choose not too. Therefore the backlash from a faulty launch is deserved.
---
Nice find! That seems very useful!
---
Anet are killing off Deus Ex Machinas left and right. Beware, the player is next.
---
I'll see you guys in 250 years in Guild Wars 3 and MOs fantastic new engine. Can't wait!
---
Or in Cantha which is shielding itself for a long time and seems like the only safe haven for now. Not sure which one I prefer. I'm still counting on you Mike!
---
Why people complaining.. it makes sense that these match the color of the brand, right?
---
&gt; hinted at years before it was used.
---
Unless the hints hut you like a truck people won't notice
---
Man, u so salty you comment negative shit over multiple threads. Gj.
---
they were on holiday, drinking eggnog, not working
---
You uh... Do you need therapy
---
Awesome thank you! 
---
damn son
---
Chill mate - some people enjoy stories.
---
Take you pitchfork here: ---E ---E ---E ---E ---E ---E ---E
---
The episode is pacing along very quickly, and the whole time I'm thinking "boy, this sure is a rushed story." In fact, this whole season has been rushed, and we've gone from killing a god immediately to having a plan and place to kill another Elder Dragon. I was getting a little annoyed by how fast progress was.
---
And then the ending hit. And I realized, that's why everything felt rushed. Because that's what our characters did. They rushed into everything, headstrong. Strap together the first thing that comes to mind and roll with it. It's worked so far. Except now it caught up with us. 
---
That ending was pretty sad. I never really cared much about Aurene. Like Taimi, she just seemed like more of a convenient plot device than a character, but that final scene hurt. 
---
I do have a small theory though. Aurene ate Joko. Someone known for being able to come back from the dead. Perhaps this isn't the last we'll see of her.
---
[im sorry](https://imgur.com/a/bz0sxfF)
---
I imagine it would be like the ones in the Crystal Oasis
---
My man's doing the ESSENTIALS here. Screw that global destruction threat, we need raw data on Canach's gambling pit damnit.
---
ANet testing something before letting it on live servers LOL
---
That sounds like some solid advice, thanks! 
---
I guess i'm way more used to older builds, such as S/P with constant blind spreading.
---
I'll do my best to notice things like charging and such, even though at times battlefield seems hella messy.
---
Inb4 S5 is just a single episode, like the anime beach episodes, just a single OVA, and then BAM, the finale (expansion)
---
We had the last chapter with time rifts. We might be able to get her again through time travel shenanigans
---
And yet Braham is somehow still alive.
---
Thanks! That's what i've been doing, minus the staying on the move part.
---
Is there anything in particular, aside from red areas, you tend to try to evade from?
---
I love that it ended with us saying "I dont know.." Like we're actually defeated this time
---
Well, Klark is going back to his old lair in  Charr Homeland, we still have to finish him and he's gravely wounded, yet he will regenerate if allowed to sleep. There we are going to use our spear once again and Aurenes brand will corrupt him, allowing her to take over his body. She will turn into crystal statue full of magic but her mind will be trapped in the mists. At the end she will call us, opening a portal to Cantha.
---
Mike, is that you? How many goddamn alts do you have in store?
---
Strange how the first instance is annoying and bland, and the last one is pretty damn good...
---
How could you tear my heart out like this Anet.
---
Omg I really enjoyed the story though, was a well done ending sequence.
---
Rip my immersion!
---
Was this really something we needed? Please tell me it has a toggle somewhere...
---
I love it, don't u dare to remove it.
---
*cries in condi*

The subreddit is not an official support channel. Any issues with bans or anything else that requires official ANet support must be handled through them.
---
Due to recent posts of people coming here to protest/ask about a ban turning into massive drama we no longer allow any posts like this on the subreddit. All you can do is contact support or you can send a PM to one of the ANet devs on reddit or on twitter or post on the official forums.
---
The support comment meant that your account was identified as being used as part of a botting net meaning it was most likely compromised and stolen at some point. Accounts like that are generally banned with no way of ever being restored but all you can do is go through official channels directly to ANET to try and resolve it.
---
No, no, no The Joko will resurrect himself from Aurene. PALAWA IGNACIOUS JOKO will be reborn and rule what is rightfully his!
---
I really hate resurrection story lines. If you kill someone then keep them dead and not waste my time or just don't kill them and  come up with something creative.
---
Oh my God you're right! She fucking ate Joko and absorbed all of the powers!
---
My data plan thanks you
---
When was the last time you saw a "server is down for maintenance - check back in 3(+) hours."?
---
Just like 1939!
---
You've just pointed out the biggest flaw of the entire reward structure of this game. The fact that gems can be traded for gold and so much is made for the gemstore means it's EXTREMELY intentional.
---
This was always and will always be the case with GW2. The primary purpose of 90% of things is to earn gold and the few times you need something exclusive its minimal compared to the reliance on gold. 
---
There are still bugs getting reported bud, lets not start handing out handjobs yet.
---
Blasting it on my surround sound. Thanks!
---
Well she absorbed some of Mordys mojo, so could be possible albeit stupid.
---
Just don't play fractals looool
---
PoF IS very well done. However it lacks a lot of replayabilty that vets desire. Many people were very impressed with the release and the experience, but a year after the release without replayabilty(and rewards) it has lost a lot of favor in the community. 
---
This sounds great for me actually, got both high end gear gpu and cpu, but gw2 hates 8(16)-core cpus 
---
Heavier load on gpu woyld be great as it only puts like 30% for me (mostly because a lot of effects are turned off because of the game crashing otherwise)
---
Save the key from the new reward track too
---
I can totally agree on that. 
---
I was just wishing for this, for the thousandth time, just last night.  And today, I read the release notes. It’s things like this that make me believe in a Higher Power. 
---
I used to do the same. Now that I finally have optical fiber it's my time to help those wondering how much time it takes to download.
---
it should also be the norm not to go all pitchforks on the developers when something goes more than slightly awry. but the games industry is anything but norm
---
we took out an eye
---
It has nothing to do with the topic as they built and sold the game with the premise of live updates. MO created this technology long before gw1. Shall I praise him for 12+ years old technology?
---
[Yup](https://i.imgur.com/34GCd0t.jpg)
---
What a horrible job you must work at if your boss and or customers never say thank you. xD
---
Interesting..... But im not sure Jormag and Primordus are available atm or even will help us whatsoever. The water dragon on the other hand...
---
As someone who played Daredevil for a long time, it can be a little tricky when it comes to positioning and using bounding dodger. You can sometimes land on the wrong place in the wrong time. I found power Soulbeast and Dragonhunter more.. laid back and reliable in this regard.
---
Thank you!
---
Did the same...but with 500... Got 0 now
---
damn you wen't all in, I just decided on Aurora
---
Sweet. Though for Mithril Ingots perhaps it should also say "and 8000 in storage guild bank."
---
Why? If something is broken customers bought their privilege to complain.
---
I used to PUG fractals daily and now haven't played the game in many months because of the increased difficulty so I'd becareful about pushing too hard.
---
Thats.... really pathetic. But fine, whatever helps you sleep at night.
---
In addition to exotics? Or are you saying you don't see any exotics in the preview?
---
Yes... 5k users is "dying".
---
That's currently the same as FF14, and SW:TOR is right now standing at 2k, with WoW being slightly higher at 8k.
---
So I guess you'll say they're all "dying"?
---
Little bit of column A, little bit of column B. Thankfully there seem to be fewer "garbage" exotics than rare and down, at least from what I saw in gw2eff for my account.
---
It is only for the communicator in your backpack during story missions. 
---
I need this. An army of Charr is invading Bloodstone fen atm.
---
roaming in wvw is dead, only those seeking mental anguish and torment do it now
---
Theres a difference between thank you and praising. I doubt you ever went to mcdonalds kitchen and praised any of immigrants working there for not fucking up your order. Thats the norm they should give you that meal properly prepared, just like it should be the norm the service doesnt break after patch.
---
material bags
---
I haven't touched it in months, laughed my way through path of fire,especially the cringey "death" scenes and how they turned Balthazar from a god of war and destruction to a fucking comic book villain. The games writing hasn't been good in ages, namely past the first 3 missions  that are actually "your story" before douchehearne strides in.
---
yeah i cannot see anything good comming with this, besides perhaps this "shock" moment, which actually was a beatiful moment.
---
Also i am sick and tired of brand(ed) everywhere.
---
&gt;I've personally been hesitant to spend laurels (that aren't really farmable) because I was expecting a major skin sink
---
Same here... while I don't have 2K, my 750 will go a long way to afford these ;)
---
Man i’m just trying to figure what’s going to happen next.
---
Major oof out of this though, I really didn’t expect the fight to go the way it did. So kudos to Anet for having the guts to do the thing(and nice character animations, it’s was neat the way the pc was animated at the end)
---
Brahm not dying is probably the true disappointment
---
It does not
---
I bought mine months and months ago. I grabbed a Mist capacitor and reset them all in preparation for this patch. 
---
Now I really hope Episode 6 won't be a filler like mursaat shenanigans in LS3. And would be more hyped on either daring to make Mists-based expansion or making a journey to Cantha
---
Got it on first :)
---
What is it used for? I got one for completing the story I think.
---
Yep. they didn't. if they did cliffside wouldn' have it right now as they said isn't intended
---
Praise Joko!
---
THEORY: as soon as mordremoth was kept alive inside trahearne, aurene remains alive inside caithe
---
At the very south of the map, underwater, I heard what sounded like whalesong. It wasn't very loud and didn't repeat very often, but it's there. 
---
Except stability doesn't affect it :(
---
I got one of the jewels but not sure what it was from. Account Bound and doesn't go in material storage... which is fun. Also, it can be applied to items but lists no stats.
---
I'm in exactly the same situation.
---
While doing the story I could enter the purple room as part of the story. I looked around everywhere in that room, killed the graveling several times, couldn't find any plates.
---
Now I came back after finishing the story, can't get into the purple room anymore, can't get into any of the others, I've gone through every mm of the entire room with a fine tooth comb and found absolutely nothing.
---
No idea what to do here. And the irritating thing is that apparently 1 poi is in one of the rooms so I can't finish map completion.
---
They should take a hint not to put stuff in gambling chests and just sell this glider on the gemstore.
---
I was debating wether I should or shouldnt add an edit of: 'unless its impossible to know who is talking due to them being obscured (like inside the belly of a giant frog, idk)'
---
But I was afraid of spoiling myself by having people explain the situation
---
Well, this is similair! 
---
But wasnt it already visible?
---
I dunno I often ended up reading from the chatlog anyway cus dialogue often happens during distractions like
---
Like
---
Ooooohhhh squirel!
---
No need to wonder just.... Praise Joko!
---
Anet had serious big balls to kill her.
---
Episode 6 doesn't exist. They said this is the conclusion of Season 4.
---
Yeah Diviner missing from Mist Pendant, Mist Band and Mist Talisman.
---
Resetting them via Capacitor post patch does not allow selection of Diviner's either. 
---
No, you should be more grateful than only coming here whining when something doesn't go your way.
---
No miracle, her resurrection was also foretold just like her death, praise Joko!
---
That's me spamming Aurene Magic.
---
Diviner Missing from Mist pendant, Mist Band and Mist Talisman :(
---
I need The Hammer's Hoard POI, and it seems I'd need key plate for it. Ppl are raging in map chat because no one's able to get it.  Maybe it's a bug? I don't know.
---
Well.. there was certainly massive things in this patch
---
Is it episode 6 confirmed, or is there a new season incoming? Not sure if this was season finale.
---
Delet this
---
I still think they don't. Mists, etc.
---
And if they do, they are going to pull out even bigger bullshit to wrap up the plot in a single episode, which is ~2 hours worth of instances at best usually.
---
I thought instabilities were supposed to make fractals more challenging, right now they just make fractals even more annoying than they already did, especially this one
---
No, I shouldnt. They dont do charity, they do business.
---
You do have a point: I'm planning on using this skin -eventually- on my mesmer. Unfortunately the problem with armor weight is not that looks are restricted to one weight class but, rather, that almost every armor set in the same weight class has the same look or theme: scholars have Radiant Armor as their only "armored" option(\*) and that set requires a crapload of AP. 
---
(\*) that I can think of, pleace correct me if I'm wrong.
---
\*Yawn\* Next Episode -  
---
Commander: Oh noez Kralkatorrik gonna eat us! We're domed! Boo!  
---
Taimi: Oh look! That's...Wait, what? It's impossible! It's Aurene!  
---
Commander: Aurene? But how...?  
---
Canach: Well somebody burped with undead magic three episodes ago, what did you expect?  
---
How dare you
---
drops from dwarven chests
---
Agreed it makes a difference. Was it some form of magic that kept him from dying or was it some sort of spell.
---
[Never in my life have I needed something so much and never know until I receive it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1moXJATS2Zs)
---
There are two POIs in question - Consul's Tomb, which I got inside the purple room, and Hammer's Hoard, which is in one of the locked "spiral staircase" rooms that I haven't found a way into yet.
---
but they are in LS3 and LS4 trinkets so not that bad ...
---
....you played a game although you hate it? Man, you really need to find something better to do with your life.
---
This is what I use and its great.  They managed to make it look like cotton fabric with metal and gems.  I'm not on a mission to get all available skins/outfits with pants.
---
Thank you! Doing all of the PC animations for the ending was a long but ultimately rewarding endeavor. 
---
Our baby... :(
---
its so depressing i just want to lay down and cry
---
Torment shield was a bit of an oddity among the torment weapons because it was almost all torment energy... Similar to how Shatterer is odd among branded for most of it's appearance being some form of energy rather than solid material.
---
reported
---
That should be a norm. "Hey, I'm so glad you *didn't* fuck up this time like usual! Here's your prize and praise!"
---
Yeah... but I have 5 Mist Accessories sitting in my Chronomancer's bags... I *just* bought a full set of accessories last patch when everything changed. This time I was hoping to future-proof myself by using the Mist ones :(
---
Mad cos bad. Git gud
---
Maybe to clarify, the death was kinda obvious. But still the way they did it was more than pleasing and deserves some kudos :)
---
Remember that Caithe is still blue even if Aurene died. Aurene might have implanted her conscience and some of her magic into Caithe. Next episode I think will be about how we kill Kralk and reanimate Aurene. There must be something. I don't belive that our dragon is gone! 
---
&gt;buying transmutation charges
---
My weekly key run consists of 100%-ing every city: I get to level 10 and gain six Transmutation charges (5x from the racial cities and one from Lion's Arch) in the process. I currently have more charges than I care to spend.
---
You lost me the minute you accused me of taking drugs for *a bit* of optimism. But alright, I'm a delusional goof. 
---
Seriously, was it? Did i miss something, because i don't remember that.
---
I just fell from Mistlock Singularity behind gates+pads mechanism in Underground and stuck behind some wooden pillar - couldn't move at all due to Slippery Slope. Thanks anet.
---
His account is from 2014 but hes had literally no post up until 3 days ago, all just shitting on GW2. The fuck?
---
Finally killing the franchise, eh?
---
then what's the upvote button for?
---
Yeah this subreddit has shown me just how angry GW2 fans CONSTANTLY are at GW2 lol it's like freakin Star Wars fans.
---
So I'll bite, what about THIS patch is pushing people off?
---
You can still teleport to the egg chamber and play fetch with baby Aurene :)
---
To be honest, you sound like you're unemployed.
---
It's cool. She just shrinks when hurt. Everything's fine.
---
I wonder what Aurene saw/heard after the trails... we weren't there with her, maybe she knew there is no other way but this. Maybe she got to know that, to defeat Kralk, she has to be in the Mists.
---
The voice acting for the last part of the last instance was amazing as well. Hearing Taimi crying like that, your character sounding like they’ve just given up all hope, everything about it was spectacularly well done. 
---
&gt;The glimpse of the almighty Kralkatorrik emerging through a sparking purple haze at the end of the recent trailer for Guild Wars 2 shows exactly what players are expected to face in the MMORPG’s latest update. **Entitled ‘All or Nothing’, it represents the conclusion to Season 4** of the game’s Living World episodes, which have regularly added new storylines and content to the world of Tyria
---
Through the fence is the easy answer. 
---
PRAISE JOKO!
---
&gt;praised any of *immigrants* working there
---
You misspelled *liberal arts majors*.
---
[This skritt](https://i.imgur.com/eIeqAFS.png) Line is the best outta all of em. 10/10
---
So Aurene absorbed Joko’s power completely. It could be that this doesn’t actually kill her. 
---
This is a story and PvE content patch.
---
Again don't know ho Elder drags work, but for example does eating all ingredients of a burger means you ate a burger.
---
&gt; minus the staying on the move part. 
---
Constant movement lets you "accidentally" avoid a lot of big charge up attacks, so most people strafe around their target while hitting it. You'll also get benefits from the Critical Strikes line from smacking people from behind :)
---
While I agree they need to make money and there's nothing wrong with outfits, I think it's somewhat tragic that we can't also receive these as armor skins. Lemme buy both. I'll buy both. I don't care if it costs more for the outfit and armor skin package, just let me make beautiful new combinations with some of these pieces.
---
The "shock" moment is practically all they can do. Eir, Blish, Trahearne... even Demmi Beetlestone and Tybalt and Joko, and probably others I'm forgetting. Marjory would have been as well but it got leaked, they cancelled it so she's just afk for the past 2 seasons. 
---
By now it's just lame and predictable, they run out of ideas on how to resolve their plots or characters in a meaningful way so they just kill them off, again and again, and people constantly fall for it like it's some groundbreaking storytelling. It's not, it's cheap and boring.
---
Yup. My pc almost took off during the first and last instances.
---
Have you tried the /stuck command? That used to work. You just have to wait about 15 seconds after typing it.
---
But... But...
---
They're a small indie company!
---
The technology just isn't there!
---
^^where'd you find this?
---
\*and a half
---
I've crashed a half dozen times, TP is lagging to shit, and i got stuck under tank rubble in final instance and had to restart it
---
it's ok but not perfect
---
I fucking love this lmao.
---
Maybe not inside Caithe, but yeah my money would be on Aurene having the regenerative powers of Mordremoth.
---
I hope not we don't need Trahearne 2.0 who is stealing us the show like in core story :D
---
Like Princess Yue? Idk though, her flowers were disappearing... I'd take it though.
---
This is the penultimate one, so there's one more.
---
This episode was so amazingly woven. The entire episode was made in a way to boost our confidence and show us how much of a problem solver we are, Tyria's own mr Wolf. The only dwarf we need is dead? No problem, the Commander makes it work out anyway. The dredge lost all the useful technology we really need right now? It's ok, the Commander and their team make it work. Glint herself tells us how much of a chosen champion we are, and how our hope and confidence is needed to save the world.
---
All this confidence causes us to go with a very balls-deep, all-or-nothing plan, with no backups or failsafes. And while everything is going so ridiculusly well, the rug is just swept from under our feet. And it's not because the plan was bad, not because we weren't strong enough, smart enough or motivated enough. Three wasn't anything wrong with our army or our weapons. It was just dumb luck, a bunch of random debris. And as we risked everything, this one time everything is lost. You start to remember the random soldiers praying in the halls, or the dredge that finally gave you their trust, or even the Zhaishen. You remember how they entrusted you their lives, all on the ragtag plan you whipped up. And while you lost, so did they. We lost the army, we lost the Forge, we lost Aurene, our only plan to keep Tyria safe.  
---
And after the episode ends, ANet has the insight to mute the usual triumphant jingles we get after finishing an episode and all the chest sounds. We just get silently dumped back into the map. Because we didn't win, this isn't a celebration like all the times before that, it's not even bittersweet.  
---
The only question that remains is... Where the hell do we go from here?
---
LMAO 
---
Except norms vary very much depending on the field you're taking a look at. Preparing a burger isn't a very difficult task, launching an episode worldwide in an MMORPG is.
---
Wonder why all launches everywhere have issues day one. Maybe they're all incompetent and shouldn't be paid.
---
I received one from the meta.
---
Very hopeful. I really want to use them... but it's hard to resist buying a full set of raid trinkets day one. Hopefully we will get an answer soon so I know whether to hold off or to buy all new ones :(
---
&gt;Episode 6 doesn't exist. They said this is the conclusion of Season 4.
---
I do want to believe you, but can I get a source on that?
---
Reminds me a bit of the [vision the Eye of Janthir](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZhENkjaZmPY) gives us. The piercing, the one glowing eye. (tbf, I just read your description, didn't play it myself yet). 
---
Laugh to hide the pain :)
---
There will always be bugs. A bug free software application is a myth.
---
And so is their answer : "fuck off, we'll fix it asap, just wait".
---
Talk about an entitled little child who doesn't know his place.
---
&gt;I'll see you guys in 250 years in Guild Wars 3 and MOs fantastic new engine. Can't wait!
---
That sounds fantastic, where do I sign?
---
Ogden did mention in the very beginning of the chapter that the events were unfolding as they should.  He mentioned specifically the death of the lich. Hmm...why did that HAVE to happen?
---
we saw Aurene's branded flowers on Caithe disapperead into air, so i think it's not the case
---
If I remember it right they were telling something about it when Episode 3 came, maybe even before that, that this season will have 6 episodes, just like HoT. And we'll probably get a next expansion announcment after that episode, not to mention the confirmation of its setting.
---
This episode's soundtrack was on fire. Easily one of my favorites ❤️
---
If you think I care of you downvoting me for putting you in your place and showing everyone your hypocrisy you are wrong. 
---
Here's another comment for you to downvote, maybe it will make your meltdown easier and you will stop whining about a game you supposedly stopped playing months ago but somehow still frequent its sub. 
---
For a nice mix of the above, I'd recommend checking out WvW, which is my preferred gamemode.
---
It's open world server vs server PvP with massive maps that retain that GW2 beauty that you seem to enjoy.
---
&gt;Did she not literally just eat King Palawa Joko, the immortal lich?
---
Braham, on Joko, in ep3:  "That's what I thought. "Can't die..." Everything can die. Only question is how. "
---
It's not like they didn't warn us about this :P
---
don't overthink it
---
Nope.
---
Ya given what the other festivals received as updates, and the return of missing festivals, I am fairly confident World 3 is coming this year.
---
I honestly think Aurene should stay dead. Resurrection just cheapens the impact and make the sacrifice meaningless just a waste of player time(and Chosen one story is getting annoying).
---
 Lets find another way of dealing with Kralky.
---
Wait, can we win money through that? :D
---
hmm... cant get new home instance node, npc is not selling it ;/
---
Brutal isn't it :( I've got 5 Mist Accessories taunting me with their lack of Diviner :(
---
Friendly reminder that commenting in all positive threads about gw2 whining constantly and insulting other users because they disagree with you is sign of being a giant twat. 
---
What's that outfit/skin?
---
Instabuy
---
Exactly, it's this argument that just cancels out anything I can come up with. Her magic is gone and her body is impaled by the brand, what the hell is left then?
---
Don't get me wrong, I agree 100% on this.
---
In fact, Braham's walrus outfit is a good example of this since its shoulder piece is sold separately on the gem store.
---
Unfortunately different armor weights have different skeletons and e.g. a heavy chest armor would look very weird on a medium class. I'm pretty sure that's why sets like Radiant have the same helm/gloves/shoulders/greaves but different chest/legs. 
---
...which also means shoulders, gloves, boots and headgear could (f)easily be made into separate armor pieces. I'm with you on that I'd buy them **and** the outfit in this case!
---
Suspicious of what? I know that shaman will be on the prowl for anything hidden they have planned for the future.
---
I wonder that to. Are they like a phone game dev? Did any PC player playtest this?
---
***Vaguely gestures at everything in a state of wanton despair***
---
Damn I need to wait then 😥
---
If only we could be so lucky and have him just die for any reason at all really.
---
Your health and armor scale based on your stats from equipment, you can adjust this based on your build and comfort level. In Pve it's popular to get pure damage stats and rely on active mitigation like dodges, blocks, evades etc. I would worry more about the playstyle of the class and see if it is fun to play. 
---
The point of the story isn't to lodge us through the map though. They've tried that before with forcing us to do hearts and it was awful.
---
I cried too, we will have necraurene dw.
---
I guess if you hit the mobs hard enough you "heal" your allies by preventing them of dying and allowing them to go ooc for quick heal :p
---
I think it's hilarious
---
Hahah my thoughts exactly 
---
No, they explicitly stated that this season will go straight into the next one. Not sure why they're doing it that way, but after episode 6 comes season 5.
---
You get them from PVP a lot easier.
---
It's fucking hilarious. I joined a cliffside lfg that was about halfway through and holy fuck, those scaffoldings are actually ridiculous with slippery slope. If we didn't have mesmers with blink/port for skips I actually don't know how doable it would have even been. 
---
Apparently that instab wasn't supposed to apply to those parts/that whole fractal though so I think that's just an oversight.
---
Thank you'
---
I really enjoyed the story though, was a well done ending sequence with the animation style.
---
During the last instance I couldn't help myself but think "It's crazy thinking this is a MMORPG instance" You'd NEVER see that level of immersion/grandeur in ff XIV (and god knows the story is crazy good for an mmo), or WoW.
---
Things can be changed people seem to think oh this has a certain number of slots that means this season is definitely that number of episodes and nothing can change. If Anet thinks 5 episodes are enough they can do that and they can change the portal tomb.
---
I got stuck twice in texture int he last intance too :p I could get out of one but not of the other that was near the very fucking end.
---
imagine if we meet her in the mists and she welcomes us with "I told ya" face
---
Oh. my. god. xd
---
I'd also assume that. But I guess there is a small chance for GW3.
---
someone pointed out that she did eat Palawa Joko, who was an immortal
---
Same for me, confused the hell out of me as the guildie in my party can see it
---
&gt; Creatures will no longer appear near the Mistlock Singularity once Rabsovich has been defeated.
---
I take credit for this one. I talked to someone at Anet's PAX West booth about removing enemies from that area so you can actually pick up the singularity.
---
&gt;I feel that they kinda got themselves in a corner to pull out infinity war thing.
---
Especially in the moment when Braham pulled up his shield and Kralk instead started to channel the powers of Zhaitan, Mordremoth and Balthasar.
---
I love these types of QoL additions! Im glad they keep doing these actively and randomly.
---
But I just have to say, it wouldve been cool if we had even some addons. I've used feature like this literally over 10 years ago in WoW via addon. Each to their own tho I guess
---
I'm curious about this too!
---
It felt like AAA quality, it put other online games to shame. Congrats !
---
don't overthink [it]
---
chills.  I'm getting Halo: CE and Elder Scrolls vibes from this.  
---
Can you tell me what happened in the episode? I understand that she dies, but how and does Kralk die too? I wont be able to play this week and im too curious ;c
---
There is. It's at a weaponstrader outside
---
You get them from the daily dwarven vault too, and since you do the meta to get in there it isn't so bad
---
Finally a story chapter that's actually good. I was tired of killing everything was causing trouble easily. The commander is just too strong, Killing 2 dragons and a god , without breaking a sweat . 
---
been doing both and got not a single one yet
---
Quite simple actually&gt;! : He does not!&lt;
---
Same, but i got 4 from the end of the vault.
---
Boy I sure am glad I spent all that time getting the LEGENDARY gliders.
---
For 2 years, we've been heading towards an ending where Aurene replaces an Elder Dragon and becomes a "Good" Elder Dragon.
---
Now that isn't happening. That's what's new. For the first time since before PoF we aren't just following a predictable line to an ending we already knew.
---
&gt; Episode 6 doesn't exist. They said this is the conclusion of Season 4.
---
Well it falls flat if it's the case, they never advertised EP5 as the final one, we're left on a cliffhanger with no clues or anything to theorize on our next move... We don't even have a season epilogue :|
---
God I don't think a game has had me depressed like this in a long LONG time. Kudos to anet, they did excellent with this.  
---
(The impact of the screenshot is lessened a little once you notice the Jenna mini, you'd think they'd disable minis to preserve the cinematic quality of this scene)
---
She had visions of dying this way all the time. I bet she's coming back in season finale with that Joko magic she should be immortal, right?  
---
Also if you closely listen to her 'chirps' it sounds like Joko laughing...
---
It's almost as if Anet didn't fully play test this and just half assed the idea and released it. 
---
From the oil-spill meta in the icy water area
---
They didn't waste their time having her eat Joko for nothing. Writing and programming and all ya know. This episode was literally so transparent and great all at the same time. I knew how it would end from the start, but was compelled to make it happen. lol.
---
Well, when you melee that thing it doesnt move at all. Just droping them under him does not trigger effect. Imo its a bug.
---
Just kill it and let the world go haywire
---
They said episode 5 is penultimate, which makes it 2nd last though.
---
This episode's writing is predictable, boring and cheap, I agree on everything. I'd even say that we never really bonded or trained with Aurene that much... hell, Caithe seems to show more love and connection with her than we ever did. We never know what's going on with her and other people keep telling her "uh she's sad, she's angry, she's depressed"... and then we go press F near her, commander tells 2 lines of dialogue and rushes off to the next story step. 
---
They keep telling about all these events and characters but they never show it...which I guess is not their fault because there's only so much they can do with ~5 hours of story content every 3 months, of which &gt;50% goes on combat encounters or fetch quests...

But then they still manage to run out of ideas on how to handle their characters or resolve convoluted plot arcs and always decide to just cut them out or kill them off. And after half a dozen times of this happening, it's lost its charm, at least for me (not everyone apparently since people are gushing over this as much as they did over blish, eir, demmi, tybalt, joko, trahearne, that random asura from the personal storyline with 10 minutes of screen time, etc).
---
representing the conclusion of Season 4 != is the conclusion of Season 4
---
All it's saying, is that All or Nothing gives us a depiction, a preview, a showing of the conclusion.
---
Not that it is the conclusion.
---
My son asked me to buy it last week too + the cat tonic... Now i want to cry with my 60 laurels left. :'/
---
Fair.
---
But ArenaNet has **always** announced the final episode as being such in the previews. I doubt Anet would ever change that since it means more hype.
---
I bet Aurene is gonna pull a Joko on us....
---
Shoutouts to whoever spoiled the ending for me in map chat :) I wish you wouldn't.
---
As someone who loved story, after i finished this one i closed game. If there is no , coming back for her, im done with gw2 i believe.
---
Fair enough. Nice to meet you. 
---
Its worth  than most realize ....we destroyed the forge    and even if we could kill krock we cant now cause the planet will explode ...we didn't just lose aurene we lost any chance we had   were back square one 
---
Yeah, so much for all of the posts saying "just wait until the next update and Chrono will be all fixed again"
---
I had some lag spikes, but no roll backs, no crashes, no disconnects! Good going Anet!
---
Now, can we talk about that ending?
---
Except it's not in most mmos and it should praised when it happens.
---
Just got mine. Now to save 60 more for when the new dragon glider gets added to it in a year... Or would it be 30?
---
I DID It was so cool!
---
Her sacrifice is kinda meaningless anyway. It was a dumb rushed plan that had practically nothing to do with the rest of the season, as always it's a bunch of technobabble that some npcs throw at us at the last possible moment. In this case it was ogden at first, and then everyone came up with something later (canach's bomb, taimi's dredge sonic cannon). 
---
If her death meant something, if her sacrifice accomplished something instead of just prolonging the status quo, then it might be good storytelling. As it is, they might as well retcon it later, it doesn't really matter if she's alive or dead, the whole season was one big waste of time in which nothing was really gained or learned.
---
I forget the exact location but I think I stumbled upon it when I went south from the Dredge oil place and into Ice Floats. That said, it may not be the only place to get it and it could just be a rare drop from the map in general, but I believe that was here I got it from.
---
Why though? The map should stand on its own, as in be appealing enough to explore on it’s own.  
---
Which it is to some extent by the way.
---
I got stuck there too! I did find a gap to get back out though.
---
That surely is a slippery slope :'D
---
Hopefully you have a shared slot to get them an item to get them out then 
---
You're assuming that the "test server" is one, tiny server for players to test on. It's not, if you want TRUE performance and bug testing on a test server, it NEEDS to be as close to the live servers as possible. Maybe on a smaller scale for cost reasons, but then you get back to the "It's not like prod, so it's not 100% accurate".
---
This kind of stuff is part of my job. Sure, they aren't a startup, but 400 people is not a lot of people (relative to other big players in the gaming and MMO markets) and not all of those are devs (based on my experience, which is probably not indicative of all tech companies, less than 1/2 of those are devs and testers).
---
They most definitely have a test server(s) that are for internal use only. The discussion here is on public test servers, which is a whole other ballgame.
---
As for test/dev/canary environments, "traditional" environments like that are more common in legacy (I.E. been around a long time), government, or banking companies. If you look at the whole "DevOps" movement and the companies, big and small, that use that methodology, then you'd notice that "static" canary/test/dev/staging environments are less common and these orgs have moved or are moving to more dynamically built environments that are automatically tested beforehand and only a handful of necessary features/parts of the system are manually tested.
---
Those legal requirements you speak of tend to not be up to date with what security/technical/testing practices actually need to look like. Feel free to prove me wrong, but I remember being docked by PCI auditors a couple years ago because we didn't use specific variables and settings in `/etc/login.defs` for authentication settings, despite the fact that those settings had been REMOVED from login.defs and only existed in PAM auth settings (where we actually set the required values). As our head of InfoSec said, sometimes being compliant doesn't always mean being secure or being stable.
---
And you guys sound like you're employed as cashiers... either that or youre communication skills are so bad people don't even bother to approach you...
---
That image is seared into my brain. 
---
I actually think Caithes connection to Aurene might be a way to bring Aurene back (just like there was a seed of Mordremoth inside Trahearne, there could be one inside Caithe), though it would kill Caithe.
---
Great i found a place where i can talk about it. I'm just... There's feels all over me 
---
You've really peaked huh 
---
Does not looks like it, only 3 AP in total :p
---
Seriously, I'm so tired of the obnoxious particle effects on *everything.*
---
Reverse it reverse it!!
---
Exactly the same as me. Too many feels. I thought abou the possibility, but when i saw it happen... damn. You're never ready for this kind of shit.
---
It's a relative waste of time knowing full well before the fight, Aurene is going to die and nobody made any preperations beforehand for it, we just walked right into it, if you're going to tell a story, make it interesting, give Aurene plot armor then pierce it in one go, Arenanet has to give us something to REALLY climb for, not just, oh shit, we lost, we're fucked and we have to wait a few months to see how fucked. I want the story told deeper and more consistently, not really shittily and half worked through, I want to see an actual episode with actual decisions and plot decisions that are thought through, add some mystery, add some confusing things, add something WORTH the time to play through, all in all I don't want the episode to be summed up in under 30 seconds and yet read out as the shittiest episode ever, go ahead, introduce someone to the new episode concisely,
---
Aurene dies and we lose against a dragon with all of our weapons perfectly prepped.
---
It sounds horrible.
---
except when you hover over items that cant be stored and it just says  8 runes 8 runes in the bank
---
You clearly have no idea how services that have to deal with a multitude of customers at the same time work on a long-awaited launch day.
---
for what it's worth, it's better than vlast.
---
With vlast, I was upset he died, but not because I cared about him, but because we'd been given no time whatsoever to care about him. This episode did what should have been done with vlast.
---
F**k you Anet! How dare you do that to our baby?!
---
I'm gonna cry in the corner now.
---
Jokes on you, it's selling for 325 now :P
---
The exotic versions are made the same way as any exotic accessory. So 5x new stat jewel (recipe drops in the new zone from events and dwarfen chests) + orichalcum stuff. 
---
Yep, got stuck there. Thankfully was playing with a party
---
Nice to hear ... I am curious on how it will look. Good luck, and have fun making it ^_^ &lt;3
---
Really, we're kinda hoping she doesn't go bad if this is how it works out. The dragons are just *hard* to kill right now, can you imagine immortal ones?
---
Does Anet test stuff? xd
---
Where is that event at?
---
So I first found a purple plate right by the dwarf.
---
Then in the purple room after obtaining the mould, went in and killed the skelk again. Got orange.
---
In orange room, at the end there was a green.
---
The PoI/throne room is green for me.
---
No, I'm dead serious. If a colleague complimented you for "finally not fucking up on the job" it would sound like a backhanded compliment at best and you'd wonder exactly what expectations your coworkers and boss might have from you.
---
Plenty did. You see their feedback here :D
---
There is one more episode confirmed by data-mining of the slots in the season 4 portal tome, and lest we forget, season 4 is to be directly followed up by season 5, not an expac, so there's no necessary story break between the two. We have 7 episodes, theoretically, to follow this plot to its final conclusion.
---
Got stuck there too. If you log out and back in you can resume after the last completed stage (but lose all chances of achievements)
---
As much as I love seeing surprising out-of-the-wazoo plot twists, I think killing off Aurene was a bad decision.
---
The way I see it, Anet has two options going forward. Either we "miraculously" bring Aurene back to life in the next episode, which would once again disparage the story and make everybody wonder why Anet insists on killing characters and bringing them back to life over and over again. This is sadly the most likely scenario.
---
Or, Aurene stays dead and we figure out a completely new way to deal with the current situation. Which would completely diminish all the previous episodes of training and nurturing Aurene to become our wonder weapon. Two and half years of silly games and adventures with Aurene, and for what? Sure, she eats Joko and saves our ass a few times during the story. But she's supposed to become the replacement of Kralkatorrik, a godly creature with enormous powers to secure the world peace. I don't believe Anet built up all this hype just to end it like this. Sure, it would be incredibly bold, and truly take away all the predictability out of the story. But I don't think Anet has the balls.
---
The story. I won't spoil it, but lots of people are upset because they figured it was predictable.
---
Personally, while I did see it coming, I felt it was a nice shakeup to how GW2 story has been going along since Season 3, and the production quality of the instances was super fucking high for an MMO. Not everything is bad because you guessed it.
---
People are free to disagree, obviously. I don't expect people to like everything I do. But there is a minority that are getting violently *angry* about it.
---
Why are you playing with our feelings. You guys and gals did great but WHY??
---
Yeah, do that in a spoiler thread please.
---
I must say..I was impressed on how abruptly the episode ends with that fade out...Almost cruel..Great touch....
---
It was it animated in engine
---
Pretty sure I was answering to the thank you bit not the " congratulations for not fucking it up".
---
it's on one of the weaponsmith vendors
---
I had too many to handle around the dredge area. But I did notice a lack at the area where you fight go outside.
---
That’s a weird way to spell McDonald’s 
---
Same thing here, guess I'll have to relive the trauma again. Did the whole thing without buffs too :(
---
Because a machine that allows you to see the ethernal alchemy totally also can suck the energy out of an elder dragon and redirect it across the world to another elder dragon :D
---
Taimi and all her bs in ls3 was deux ex machina. 
---
Aurene isn't and this ep proves it. 
---
Joko was immortal right, and Aurene ate him. She'll get better right guys. ;_;
---
well it's from technical masterminds who gave us domain of kourna so... we lucky we are able to play it today I guess
---
probably because very few people care
---
easy \^\^
---
You can also blame that lovely couple of power firebrand and renegade.
---
This is why quality studios have public test realms on their MMO's but somehow Anet can't be bothered with player feedback, they'd rather beta test their live releases.
---
did those leaked weapons from yesterday make it in? or where those fakes or something?
---
Keeping a stack of 139 in the bank? You maniac. Swap it with a stack from storage so you can deposit.
---
I'm hoping for a truly tragic conclusion to the Kralk story which involves several major heroic but tragic deaths (Taimi, Braham, Aurene takes Kralk magic to the mists to save the world, maybe solving other dragons somehow too, or prolonging their sleep) freeing up the narrative to go anywhere else.
---
Enter Cantha - we are burnt out from being the Commander and our allies are either finished their missions or gone/dead so we can cut ties with them and start a completely fresh journey across the ocean. New allies, new lands, new protagonists. Guild Wars 2 has been doing the Elder Dragon stuff for seven years (Aurene has been the major focus since Season 2), it should end with Aurene ascending to bring balance to the world and the current cast can be retired - let that be the end of the current conflict freeing us to take on ANYTHING else. The game desperately needs a new narrative.
---
He clearly was barely moving unless he planned it all along. Then all of the sudden he could get away from this trap after being so exhausted. There must be something more in this. 
---
Will add you when I'm next online :)
---
What do you prefer? Dealing damage directly, or dealing damage over time? What weapons do you enjoy using so far?
---
I have never been so emotionally gutted by a gw2 anything as I am now. Not even with Trahearene and I guess I was in the small amount of the fanbase that adored him. I literally started to tear up and while it was quickly made better by people making puns in map chat (God bless them) I just, oof. it was rough for me boys.   
---
She'll come back, probably, but just turning the corner and seeing that, there was no way I could've been prepared for it actually happening. 
---
&gt;  frolicking and playing catch with quaggan pups.
---
I approve of this direction
---
Skritt voice lines can be heard all around the new map, no matter where the original npc is. similar to the bug on jahai bluffs launch
---
I too hate things that generally don't affect me
---
I mean, prophetic dragon mummy took Aurene and showed her something off screen, obviously it doesn't end here.
---
😕 Marjory and Kasmeer are just....
---
Cousins. 😐
---
That dredge part where you have to "solve" that great puzzle with the oil barrels.
---
And I don't disagree with you on that. It was a shake-up, even though personally I knew something would go wrong the second we spoke about this 'plan', but my problem is that this is setting the story up for a gargantuan Deus Ex or major lore fuckery in the caliber of "Quick commander, enter the Dream through me!" we got with Trahearne at the end of Heart of Thorns.
---
They've stuck themselves into a situation where it will be impossible to get unstuck from unless we spend a good few episodes trying to find a way to save Aurene, because if we do it in one episode (which is usually 2 hours max) then it's guaranteed to be simply bad. 
---
And quite frankly, I'm saying all that because GW2 has a humongous potential to be grand. The setting and lore are pretty wonderful, and some of the ideas it has are pretty damn good, but it always seem that they don't go all the way on the Living Story episodes, and usually create more questions than answers (like the episode where you were forced to pledge your life to the Human queen as a Charr commander). 
---
And don't get me wrong, the feel and visual direction of the episode was pretty good. The way they did the corridor sequence and the way it was made to reveal Aurene in such a sudden and abrupt manner was pretty good, but it's frustrating to see how volatile the narrative seemed behind it.
---
Haven't played this evening but this is a really good addition. I'd appreciate if they would add an extra line that says how much is in other characters inventories though. 
---
Maybe Caithe’s connection with her and the fact that she ate Joko, so how about her developing his power from now on and coming back to life?
---
My only issue was that I'd sometimes be reset a few steps in a corridor of the final instance, but everything else was fine!
---
WoW uses public test servers,
---
Aion has public test servers,
---
ESO has public test servers.
---
Rift has test servers
---
No I am obviously not going to compare them to some small game. I’m going to compare them to other MMO’s.
---
Watch on 1080pHD or dont bother xD
---
There were quite alot of amazing places that i think either the druid back piece collection or aurora collection took you, quite little waterfall areas but i cant remember them :(
---
The HOT maps also have me in complete awe. 
---
No, it's Eirson*
---
Good, I want my Balthazar back they can keep their pet size dragon.
---
I prefer having that than a subscription.
---
Wow, that is very high praise. I'm so happy you enjoyed it. Thank you &lt;3
---
To prevent old tricks like "cute_kitten.mp4.ps1", Powershell scripts can't be run with a simple double-click. If I'm not mistaken you can't even run them on Windows 10, unless you allow unsigned scripts.
---
You know how sometimes within a story a character is so important that even if they seem to have died you just don't believe it? This is how I feel about Aurene's death. She's a character that has been hyped pretty much from HoT, and is needed in the plot to take Kralkatorik's place. She is too important to die, and therefore has ten tons of plot armor on her. I honestly think they'll just bring her back (and if the narrative team thinks that killing such an important character will somehow move the plot forward then I don't know what they're thinking). 
---
yah I just checked, I think the story room takes a purple plate, everything else you describe is what happens when you give the dwarf the meta items.  I think the rooms up to the PoI room are random though, I never fought a skelk other than for the story step
---
But didn't Aurene just effectively make Caithe her minion?
---
Robert Kirkman
---
is it deepstone garbage or different?
---
I loved this episode, but I couldn't stop laughing over Taimi glitching into the ground.
---
Could we also get some appreciation too our boys in red and varya? #cykablyet
---
ESO has as many issues with lag and bugs as we do. Aion and Rift don't have nearly as 1/4 of the population nor the updates.
---
As for WoW can't really speak never really got into it so I don't know if they lag a lot or not on patch days.
---
The opposite for me. I finally feel like playing the story. Personally I want really dark and gritty story that isn't afraid to kill off major characters without bribing them back.
---
Thread removed: Spamming is not allowed.
---
You need to take a long break. I felt bored after making all legendaries and raids stuffs. Now, I only log in to get the living story for free. I bought a Switch and playing Zelda right now. 
---
And how do you get statuettes? Right, from BLC keys. You may get a BLC key drops once in a blue moon from normally playing the game, in the past 4 months I've gotten 4 drops top. That's 4 statuettes out of 60.
---
I loved the details. First, the prophecy, Aurene's vision in last ep, became true. Rewatch that cutscene and you see the pose she has here is exactly the same as the one she had in that ep. 
---
Including the exalted into the story was really good as well .. 
---
I have to say, believe or not, that I saw this coming before joining the last instance. When I realized we were figthing Kralk I said "No this is going wrong its way too easy" and it did ! Great Job Anet. However I was not expecting Aurene move. I was expecting some kind of save from Glint from the mists, or Aurene popping out a shield out of somewhere and getting really weak but not this. 
---
Obv She is not dead. She is afterall the savior of the world and Glint foresaw that. The next ep is going to involve a lot of mists action, possibily glint and possibily , maybe, I hope so, a re-enact of glint's cleansing. This was done in the desert right? So we might get back there. 
---
This makes me think that LS5 might be a fully LS dedicated to Kill Kralk .. Remeber that they said Kralk went wild inside the mistis and that he was gaining power cause he ran over Glint forces .. all this time we're going to spend reviving Aurene will give him time to regain the power he lost here, maybe become even stronger. 
---
This is definately the best move Anet ever pulled story wise. Everything made sense and fit together.. really cool. 
---
Heck, I usually don't bother you guys when I see you with the tag up. Don't want to intrude on your own playtime. 
---
Am I just tricking myself out of chatting with you all?
---
I took my meme p/p deadeye I use for gathering and threw together an exotic set for daredevil and managed to pull 33k on the golem under usual buffs w/ cheap food... so that was nice to see. I'm severely lacking in ascended armor/weapons. I'm really up for any role, just need to get used to being so frail after so much necro play.
---
The insignia recipe is in a different vendor somewhere.
---
I have hundreds from WvW chests. 
---
I don't know, I am glad they picked a definitive female for this. 
---
It's brilliant. I love it.
---
this literally does not spoil anything, and does have a spoiler tag. bad mod.
---
I was confused too .. what has Joko to do with any of this? Glint said she could only take the trial once he was dead .. why? 
---
I won't deny experience and professionalism have an impact. But you can, however, use people with low skills in the field. That's barely possible in IT. Either it works, or it's unshippable.
---
That's why we talk about "qualified and non-qualified" jobs. This does not deny the pressure or difficulties you can encounter in your job.
---
Pharus looks like a Trimphant longbow. I feel bad for people because it's obvious the later gen legendaries have been a huge step down in effort. Jesus christ I still won't forgive them for Flames of War and Claw of Khan Ur.
---
Whoa, first time seeing the Diviner’s armor set. Looks really interesting! Tempted to craft it! 
---
Hey it's me. Claw island! I got killed, Apple guy! Yes that's me! I know! I know you remember! Can you portal me in?
---
Isn't it supposed to be Sandswept Isle Team on that episode though? or they changed the 1-4, 2-5, 3-6 cycle?
---
Dragon Age: Inquisition and Destiny 2 did this too. It's such a good way to make you feel vulnerable. 
---
its on a bigass cooldown so it basically does nothing. worst case the projectiles can be reflected to avoid any damage, though i dont think the reflection does any damage back
---
"Ask us anything! :D"
---
CLOSED. 
---
I have another, cooler theory. 
---
I think we're going to cleanse Aurene like the Forgotten did with glint. It would be kinda lame that the next ep starts with "Yay PRANKED I CAME BACK AHAHA" move .. after such an epic ending, it needs an epic follow up ep and explaining exactly how Glint was cleansed and do it on Aurene would be great. 
---
I had the same issue. Used the Jahai portal scroll and now that char is stuck on a loading screen to Thunderhead indefinately.
---
Wait what? Where and when?
---
OH SHIT GUYS!!! They did their job corretly, praise them, praise
---
&gt; I do have a small theory though. Aurene ate Joko, someone known for being able to come back from the dead. Perhaps this isn't the last we'll see of her.
---
I was wondering that, too.  Braham also mentions in this episode something about how things that die never stay dead anymore.  (Don't remember his exact wording.)
---
"I'm literally crying" is a spoiler in a sense in the title. I glanced at this title before finishing the episode and was expecting the worst. It happened. It lessened my surprised. I understand you're emotional, but please be more considerate next time. 
---
What’s the armor shown in this blog post?
---
Ogden literally says in the beginning of the episode that the death of a lich is part of the prophecy. Which dragon just absorbed the powers of joke who can resurrect? Hmmmmmmm
---
Well...We also did admittedly took half of his face. So he is not as strong as before.  
---
Same, was really cool to see Gwen.
---
I am so mad. SO. MAD.
---
When you do it through the dwarf you get a special interaction key that scans for treasure, with a big last treasure being in the PoI room
---
Lol, thats just for the announcement post but still funny
---
Can people stop posting threads like [SPOILER] I AM LITERALLY CRYING! Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's a spoiler, anyone who's played episode 4 can narrow down the reasons for you literally crying, idiot.
---
and also every single insignia also costs a lot, so there's that too
---
The Super Secret Dragon's Only Ascension Talk that we get shuffled outside for is probably part of that too, I imagine.
---
I will my Babydragon back q.q
---
When playing the story, do you remember that Aurene's biggest fear was dying and becoming branded or dead? When we fought her branded self thing.
---
Glint says Aurene has to do something that is "impossible" to her to do. At the end of the story, it felt like... she had to die. Could be her visions also the same thing? That she has to end this way for something to happen, let it be anything?
---
Because what Glint said in the instance got stuck in my mind. Did that mean sacrifice? is it something in order for something to happen to her? Is she TRULY dead? I understand the connection/flower thing ended at the end as well with Caithe, but... is she really dead or just in a different state? Would be her sacrifice something she had to do either she really died or not? Because to me... sacrificing yourself for someone else, is probably one of the hardest choice in your life and death.
---
Remember the whole thing where Glint(?) or someone said, that Aurene's power is basically in having us... a companion. Does that mean it was needed in order so she would end up sacrificing herself? It makes sense, as in you would probably never do such if you had no one you trusted and loved. Just as Caithe said, she trusts and loves us so much it's almost painful.
---
I believe the point was, that she had to make a sacrifice. And I think that means something huge in the future, something... or our PC will be affected by this hugely, not just by her apparent death.
---
To me her "death" felt shocking yes, but also somehow it felt so... so forced, in a weird sense. It makes no sense to me story-wise to lose two great characters, that were rather fleshes out and not just random pop-up characters, in such a short time.
---
Did they expand material storage or do ingots not follow the 250 stack "rule" for some reason?
---
Not enough War Assets, so it defaulted to the worse ending. 
---
Good job! I like it. I wish someday we would have a GW2 movie like Warhammer.
---
Stay tuned for the next exciting episode of Dragon Ball Z I guess?  But seriously, Idk.  Either it becomes a plot hole, or we will find out next episode.  Perhaps it has something to do with what Glint wanted to discuss with Aurene alone? 
---
I think they talked about how Aurene HAD to die now in order for us to be able to win in the future.  There was absolutely no way we would defeat Kralkatorrik WITHOUT Aurene dying, as we saw in her vision last episode.
---
That being said, maybe it is another of Glint's prophecies?  Maybe I am wrong, but as I said before, wait until the next installment.
---
Hey, dunno if you're the right person to bug about this but I didn't see a single subtitle during that final sequence outside of the commander's final line and Zafirah's text bubble. I'm not hard of hearing or anything, but I suspect someone out there is going to feel their absence way more than I did.
---
KC and Qadim are bugged, do you call this smooth? And this patch didn't even touch the raids...
---
Did they die? 
---
so 4 characters per weapon. Just need 64 characters ...
---
Thank you for the report! I'll look into this.
---
KC doesn't get a CC bar, due to statues not debuffing him after 33%
---
Maybe just the model for the dragonsblood spear special action used in the new map and story instances.
---
For what it's worth, I started on my first legendary weapon in like, August.
---
I finished it and full legendary armor, while starting to raid for the first time in about September, within the year. And I probably play an average of ~2-3 hours a night for 2-3 nights a week.
---
You can do it man : )
---
During the final story I glitched into a wall and got stuck.  And of course since Anet won't just let us have /gg in instances I had to just log out to restart.  Really killed the pacing of the fight.  Also the fact that I can't buy the home node is annoying.  I'm more so annoyed about the lack of /gg to fix bugging through walls as it has happened to me 3 times this living story season.  
---
Wait. Incoming strike damage?
---
That's punishing! Nice.
---
There are dragonsblood ballista in the new map - maybe they use that model for the bolts?
---
Grab the pitchers of beer?
---
Good luck chewing crystal.
---
just a reminder that this has been a problem for a long time and it could easily be solved by just letting us /gg anywhere in game
---
Hey I just got stuck under that rubble! Left the instance and about to start it again... if this wasn't such a great patch generally I'd just quit and do something else and come back another day but seriously I don't know how that got through QA.
---
This seems to be actually a decent way of getting them as long as you have access to that catacombs PoI. Therefore, I would either take a portal if you find someone in LFG offering one, or just wait a bit until prices for the plate parts stabilize. I just hope people don't turn them into a soft nullification, although if that happens, you can simply farm the masses elsewhere.
---
Regardless of the future, the moment it was the Commander and Aurene alone during the very last phase, I knew that our dear Dragon Daughter would end up in one of her visions. F\*\*\*, my hands were shacking during the ending cinematic and the final - literal - crawl. 
---
As for Caithe: I was kinda disappointed that despite her early built connection to Aurene, she weren't used more in said role, like letting Aurene speak a bit more after everyone was "WTF dragon turning evil /gg every1" Nontheless, her whole appearance change in that role was a niche touch!
---
She hasn't exact been immediately killed off, we've had her for years. 
---
is it sandswept? well, events on that map are also reported being broken for some time, so not much difference. Just like with season 3, best devs got assigned to team 1.
---
During the Snowblind Fractal, the bonfire and ice wall bugged out and wouldn't emit the fire buff or burn the wall down.
---
Maybe they're a streamer. Some streamers/youtubers get donations to open loads of BL chests.
---
Instabilities are a lazy way to make fractals more difficult. People defend them and say something "god forbid they make the content harder and you have to adjust your gameplay/build to match". Yeah, that would be fair if the reason for these changes were interesting mechanics or enemy abilities. Instead it's "hitting enemies while others are close by punishes you" or "a bomb randomly appears on you, lol!".
---
I think it is supposed to be a separate thread for each question otherwise it would get very hard to follow very quickly.
---
Its ok she ate Joko - watch her become dragon-lich in the next episode.

So it's the new Nullification Sigil, gotcha

---
Quite simple really: Wounded animals are the worst opponents you can think of. Desperation and pain make you mobilize unexpected resources. I would not be surprised if they don't explain how it didn't work out. We thought he was done for, he wasn't, he released a massive surge of brand and fled, wounded... not much more to it, I expect... 
---
But surely there is more to Aurene, because I will never forgive this game if they killed her for good, and it seems incredibly unlikely, too. 
---
Up voted you to offset the idiots.
---
You can completely start raiding with exotic gear! Particularly on a power/zerker class (condi classes can be more effected by the stat difference + it isn't economically worth crafting exotic vipers).
---

The machine was set up right from the very beginning as a machine that allows you to interact with the ley lines and the flow of magic. It showed you the eternal alchemy by immersing you in the flow of magic through the world.

How are you supposed to get the plates anyway? I've done the keep meta event and didn't get it

---
As someone who has played the game for 6 years, this is great.
---
But i can see why a new player might say "Wtf too much info to read on item descriptions, im out."
---
The humans who saw what Balthazar was doing and still followed him, or did it happily like the one priest in DR, are the only ones I have respect for.
---
We killed two dragons already. Everyone said you couldn't kill one Elder Dragon, two have fallen now. Aurene isn't dead, but the story hasn't done a good job of making her essential to the defeat of an Elder Dragon.
---
She's not even necessary to hold excess magic - Kormir, a human, was gifted the ability to absorb Abbadon's powers in GW1, why can't another being - like the Pale Tree or a human god - take Aurene's place?
---
I mean this is always a balancing act though. You have to make things cheap enough that someone buys it at least, or you'll make nothing at all. And there is also an element of getting value. You might be able to dupe someone into buying a $100 thing once, but if what they get doesn't feel like it has a $100 value, then they won't buy something again. The benefit with the smaller purchases is that its easier to create an ongoing spending habit, where players can easier justify the more frequent but smaller payments. I don't think its anywhere near as easy as to say hike up the prices and get some dumb sucker to buy it, as that isn't a sustainable business model, in general.
---
I'm sorry to break it to you but... you're not real--you're just part of a fractal.

Black Lion Chests have themes that change every once in a while (usually during releases or holidays/events), which add extra items to the list of possible rewards, plus iirc a guaranteed drop of a certain item depending on the theme.

---
was not aware power quickness firebrand was a thing, I've only seen condi.  Same for renegade.  I think this will only help pve chrono 
---
I might have a borderline tinfoil hat theory.
---
She absorbed Mordremoth's power right? And what was his domain? **The mind**...
---
Glint during the first part of the story separates the commander from Aurene to tell her something that only dragons can understand and she also says that Aurene will have to do something that will seem impossible to her.
---
**Now what if through the laser beam battle at the end she was able to transfer her conscience through it and to swap it with Kralk's?** She would have killed him for good by destroying her body with Kralk's conscience trapped inside. That explains also why "Kralk" left after killing her, since he could have probably just fucking blasted the whole place into space.
---
Also on a side note remember how, after linking with caithe, she said "I'm not Him." which in my opinion is supporting further this theory.
---
&gt; We killed two Elder Dragons and put two others to sleep, we don't need Aurene. 
---
Do you actually follow the story at all? The world is literally falling apart because the magic is out of balance Tyria is colliding with the Mists, everything is going to shit. The whole reason glint and her children were needed was to REPLACE the elder dragons because just killing them means the world ends.
---
Necro+Mesmer.
---
Mesmer because portals are always good in dungeons and such, and necro because it's by far the most capable "one man army" for any pve content.
---
Youre not a gamer.
---
Is it bad that I don't even remember what Kourna and Sandswept even look like or had to do? lol
---
Well aside from the personal connection of Scion and Champion and you know, raising her since she hatched, she was important for Glint's Plan. As far we know, she is the last Scion and without a Scion, we can't replace the Elder Dragons. There are probably other options, but we've yet to think of them because we've been going with Glint's Plan for so long.
---
So we kinda did need her now. We can't kill Kralk without something to take its place and she was all we had to take its place. If we don't have something to harness the energy, it will be unleashed into the world and destroy it, doing exactly what we stopped Balthazar from doing and he could have absorbed most of it. Also, even with Aurene, we couldn't kill Kralk so without her we may not be able to finish the job even if we could deal with the energy problem. Kralk does have the power of like 5 Elder Dragons and a God/Bloodstone and we were already exploiting its weakness.
---
Also, we didn't put Prim and Jormag to sleep; Balthazar did by sapping their energy. And we also don't have time to come up with a new plan since as the last instances revealed, Kralk was in the Domain of the Lost and we had to act then. And correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this the first time the Commander has failed like this. The Pact lost again Mordremoth and we didn't do so well against Balthazar. But we were leading multiple armies in an assault against and Elder Dragon and unlike the last two times, we failed. Like the last dialog says, we don't know what to do now since Aurene was our plan and now it is gone. As a player, it is easy to say Aurene will come back somehow, but for the character, such a belief would be delusional at the moment.
---
From here on out it's either some Game of Thrones type of shit with a huge build-up and no pay-off other than, lol you died or they will bring her back from the dead with Joko power and then the "real" fight happens.
---
As someone else in my guild said, I hope she stays dead. It's more interesting and unpredictable to say what comes next. The other option is honestly quite of cliche when you think about it and I sighed a little when I read it here. Yeah it makes sense, too much so. But then again, I wouldn't mind the predictability because I really want my Aurene and new Caithe back, damnit!
---
Unpopular opinion but I personally love the instability and find it one of best things anet invented recently. Was doing fractals 81 and 69 all day today
---
Your account history is interesting to say the least, a four year account that became active 3 days ago to shit on GW2.
---
Intriguing 🤔.

it's natural for season 4 that you dont remember what maps look like, no worries

Yeah I hear that. I must have been out of my mind when I made my exotic viper set for my ranger trapper.

Ah, yes, fuck off

I am sad... I enjoyed doing cliffside with this today

While we are on this subject can anyone guide me through which courses or skillset i need to have to get an internship or possible a job at a game development company. Im still a beginner and want to learn a lot.
---
It does apply to Dragons. Glint is "alive" and well in the mists.
---
Same here, I own every node except the treasure chest.  No option to buy it.  Pretty bummed I won't get it before reset.  
---
and the most important thing... you get items you need to craft the "new" exo insignia and inscription to change your stats on your ascended weapons and armours.
---
Don’t have one... guess I’m stuck then lol
---
Rip
---
Yeah kill off Aurene but keep Taimi...why?
---
Looking into this. In the mean time, you can use the /stuck command and then die, retry from checkpoint and you should be able to move forward.
---
/stuck currently takes you to the beginning of the instance, and I will be looking into changing it so it instead takes you to the most recent checkpoint.
---
ArenaNet knocked it out the park on this one, I mean this is just a completely different game to the one we were playing in 2012. I can't wait to see how the game progresses in the future, it's going to be insane.
---
I hope Aurene stays dead and isn't just resurrected next episode, this is the most powerful scene in the game so far and I wouldn't want it to lose any impact. 
---
pfffff 10 questions, 12 responses and fluff will get most dev attention
---
dont bother with that farce
---
Too soon...
---
The Ghostly Messenger that tells you Flings forces have been beaten back in the second instance is Gwen.
---
I appreciate how they did it. If you played the first game, it's clearly Gwen and it's a cool nod. If you didn't, it's just a messenger and it still works.
---
I feel it's more mixed, personally. Some legendaries like Ipos, Chuka and the scepter thing are very well made (though I only like some of them appearance-wise but that's more personal taste).
---
Yeah that's one thought I had.  
---
"Holy crap, there's not a bug making the entire episode unplayable? PROGRESS!"
---
I wasn't too shocked about the ending, I kinda would've been more shocked if we actually killed an elder dragon buffed with the might of 2 other dragon and a god. 
---
Two things that really stood out for me tho were the chants in the forge at the end, it just felt really great that after such a sorrowful episode, you come back to the world with mournful sounds instead of the general adventure/combat music. 
---
The second things is the forced camera movement when you fight kralk and when he beats everybody at the end. In my case, I was kinda speedrunning through everything because of the achievement and the feeling of urgency from the episode but being forced to watch kralk break in the cavern and the tunnel vision at the end were really great. 
---
Also taimi's voice actress really stood out at the end. Great performance. 
---
You’ll never be glamor
---
Maybe build templates will be released in the form of a mobile app!!!
---
I saw the description of that and I just thought why would you do this or think it could be fun? Instabilities were already cancer..now they have made them terminal.
---
I'm expecting Aurene to pop her limbs back into place, drain Caithe of her lifeforce and monologue. 
---
"The rumors of my immortality are drastically...understated. Oh, Kralkatorrik, you look so disappointed. So impotent. I feel for you, I really do. But let's be honest: you knew, in your heart. Fear not, the world will not forget you. The scars you've gouged into it spell out your name for all to see. Once you're gone, everyone will flock to my embrace. They will all love ME— Aurene Ignacious Joko! "
---
You can just talk to the NPC and leave the window open where you can choose and pick before the fight ends. It counts.
---
I mean I am so glad that for once our hastily thrown together plans didn't work out. Everyone was like "We got this, Kralkatorrik is toast" and I was expecting the most underwhelming finale to the whole story arc imaginable but this time Anet managed to honestly surprise me.
---
So, was this the last episode of the season? Kinda feels like we're done for now, I can't really see any solution to the dragon problem that could fit in just one episode now - but I am prepared to be underwhelmed.
---
Fractals ARE a grind every time - instabilities make them even worse. They've lost the plot.

I don't pay attention to the story, what happened?

We are absolutely, absolutely *fucked*
---
I was so thinking this. "Oh God". Nothing else.

Then they add other stuff for direct purchase to give the illusion that they're being fair
---
You can keyfarm, if you have tomes to spare. You make a new character, get them to level 10 to run the first part of the story for a key at the end, delete them and repeat. You can get 1 key per week this way. Or if you have more tomes to burn, there are more keys without the weekly gate, 1 in the story chapter in old LA (where Caithe brings Destiny's Edge together, level 40), the Claw Island fight (lv 60), and you can get 2 more if you have LW2 and HoT.
---
You also have a chance to get a key from each map you complete (except cities, but including expansion and LW maps). Wiki says about 20% chance.
---
**WHAT?**
---
"and 10000 in alt accounts".
---
Something that would be cool if you could do for all your videos, dulfy, is to add in your description the time links for each mount/skin etc. for those of us that just want to look for one mount :)

I laughed

Ooh, really? I didn't know the wait time for the command was that long (the 5 minutes part).

---
&gt; Is it? 
---
&gt;Regarding moving from Season 4 to Season 5, we announced this in the 6th Anniversary Celebration Video. We talked about wanting to release expansion level stories and features over the next couple years. Our goal is to create powerful moments like the final instance of this episode that are a culmination of multiple departments and raise the bar for what it means to be a Guild Wars 2 experience.
---
I love that update. 
---
I truly hope they don't bring back her from dead. 
---
It won't sting if the scaled deus ex machina comes back an episode after. And with death remaining death, the entire plot may get more interesting.
---
stay dead
---
Not really a bug, feels more like an oversight.
---
In de dwarven catacomb the green plate only drops for the person that activates the sarcophagus, not for everyone that killed the graveling. Leading to 20 players spamming the sarcophagus in hopes of being the lucky player that can advance the puzzle.
---
Yeah thats the part that would save it at least, dont get the 20% increased stab duration in this context at all.
---
Death is kinda meaningless in the GW universe due to the Mists. You can meet just about anyone in the Mists as we've seen recently with Snaff, Eir, and Glint. 
---
So might as well just have Aurene in the Mists for plot reasons moving forward without an overpowered dragon pet.
---
Krakatoa dye pack but no dyes that look like Krakatoa..
---
So.... picking specifically at his "in the next couple of years" and pressing avoidance of naming the development of expansions, actually mean that we won't even see an expansion in 2020, if.... ever?
---
The AI has already traced your signal, don't worry about it.
---
When the time is nigh, the big Arena.net symbol in the sky will show you the way to the land where zone transitions are seamless, the view distance is endless, the lighting is so volumetric you could touch it and Aurene is still alive and playing hide and seek with you. Oh and high detail and model limit with 144fps as a bonus because MO loves us.
---
Except it's probably very similar code as the S3 portal tome. And just because the tome UI can hold 6 slots max doesn't mean they have to fill it up.
---
I can't finish the story as the hammer kicks me every time the last cutscene plays...
---
You mean you don't thank Percy Spencer every time you microwave your lunchbox?
---
Am... Am I the only one?!
---
That's the thing - back then they stopped adding armor sets to the gemstore bc people complained about not getting new armor from anywhere else in the game. Now that we're actually getting ingame obtainable armor sets again, there's no reason for them not to add back armor sets on the gemstore. I do think that they're continuing with outfits bc they're easier for them to create though.
---
Maybe, but remember Caithe's flowers, the "branding" that Aurene gave to Caithe, faded during the scene, signifying an actual death.
---
That's fairly solid evidence that GW2's expansion days are done.
---
It's called positive reinforcement. Talk to your parents about it.
---
I call toilet paper company every time I wipe my ass and compliment them how awesome was the experience
---
The very last reveal was very strong, I admit. But I'm fed up with anet killing off everyone left and right so  I'd have chosen the boring fairy tale ending instead of what we got.
---
Not to mention that based on the ending all hope is lost, and a comeback from this state will feel cheap and dumb most likely. Maybe it's time for me to let the story go, and just use a Teleport to friend to get to the new maps from now on.
---
I can so imagine Snargle being all "damn I fucked up Tyria's last hope... *again*."
---
I mean, he even made Kralk cooler: now he is gonna wear a badass pirate's eye patch...
---
Who's Gwen?
---
News flash: expecting a company to work is now entitlement.
---
In ten years we'll be calling the plumber so that we can do the plumbing in their place and then buy them a coffee.
---
Yeah guess I’m screwed... lol
---
Infusing or attuning the new Jalis ring makes it have no name and the verata signet icon.
---
I’m more of a bandit dog person.
---
Reminded me about the Nuke helicopter crash in COD 4.
---
Oh, its even worse imo.
---
I'd be stoked if we could get it as an outfit and armor. Even if they decided on some 'lower budget' armor where they just slash the outfit into appropriate armor pieces (around waist level for chest, elbow and down for gloves etc). Would make mitching and matching a bit harder, but way better than no mixing and matching at all. 
---
For what I've figured out, there are 2 meta events, one North and one South, both spawning alternately at xx:45 every hour. Each one rewards you with a part of a plate, which, when needed, are needed to open the dwarven vault. The North meta rewards you with some of the Branded currency and the jewels required to craft dragonblood weapon, which from what I heard is also inside the dwarven vault. Dragonblood weapons also require a good amount of the map currency, meaning those events will be pretty popular in the next weeks. . I had the opportunity to lead the North meta, the rewards were rather good, several champs, the jewel I mentioned and many trash mobs which can be good with karmic retribution if you're in need of karma.
---
We can just use philosophers stones from the mystic forge, it'll be fine
---
I got out of the instance and my character shouts "I deserve an award". Made me chuckle in a slightly grim kinda way.
---
Something to consider; it was pointed out that he was using Zhaitan's magic, but he also absorbed Mordremoths magic too (which is mind-based). 
---
😍
---
Or inside Caithe... Sort of like how Spock put himself inside McCoy or how Voldemort used horcruxes.
---
they said the same when season 1 started and we know how well "no expansion" business model was for them :)

Oh yeah, I **immediately** disabled by silly mini pet during that moment.
