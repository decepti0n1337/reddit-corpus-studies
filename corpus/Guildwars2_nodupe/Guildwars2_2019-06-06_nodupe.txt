No.

You need to read some feedback on how anet operates, their top down management is poor and there is poor communication between teams and management.
---
Well, I guess it depends on a number of factors. Some people make legendaries for the prestige factor. Some are just completionists and want to unlock every skin. I'm more of the latter than the former, but that's not the reason I make legendaries.
---

---
There are two. All any MMO ever really becomes is a list of stuff to do. Because at the end of the day, once you finish the story in most games, the game is pretty much over, much like watching a TV series. Adventure games and RPGs anyway. You play them, you win, and generally you move on. 
---
Some games renew themselves through mods like Skyrim, where you're always playing a slightly different game, but even Skyrim didn't give me more hours than MMOs I've played.
---
MMOs eventually come down to busy work. If you're a raider, that's your busywork. Doing the same raids over and over again. Me, I'm an altoholic. I like making characters and getting them through content, but just not the same thing over and over again, because my characters are themed. I have a norn pirate that looks awesome, but unfornately he's a ranger, because the legendary rifle that looks like a ship would have been perfect for him. It would have fit the character.
---
To me, if a legendary looks like a character would have it, I want it to be part of that character's look and feel. This is the same with minipets, mount skins and titles for me. I don't need every title, but when the Salty Sea Dog title came out, I had to have it for my pirate character (along with the privateer runes so he could should yarr from time to time and summon a parrot).   It's part of the game's customization for me.
---
I have 43 characters now. Some are themed more on a realistic theme, some are just jokes. I have a character named Rytlock Brimstem, who's a Sylvari warrior in a guild called Hedge of Destiny.  It's just something that I thought would be fun.  
---
It keeps me busy, it keeps me playing and I'm having fun.  
---
I should mention that I don't grind for legendaries either. I cheat a lot of it.  I have ten accounts most of which I bought dirt cheap and I log in on them every day (using gw2 launch buddy to save time). I only really play 2 of the accounts. The other eight fund my legendary habit with mystic coins (I do the mystic forge dailies on those accounts and laurels. I don't mind running dragon stand for Crystalline Ore, because I enjoy Dragon Stand.  I enjoy WvW so gifts of battle aren't really an issue for me.  And I don't mind completing the world or HoT zones on different characters, because I find it relaxing. 
---
Probably a longer answer than you wanted, but there you are. lol
---
Skyscale collection after you finish Dragonfall stories to get the new mount. Gorrik put them there to raise them.
---
So adorable!
---
I don't believe it's true. I get recipes semi-regularly and they sell for a decent amount.
---
Stick with Guardian!
---
Way more versetile in all gamemodes, really solid class!
---
Yes. Anet not doing anything is the reason people make posts about it. Otherwise they would 100% continue to do nothing. This way they might actually do something. That's how the whole thing works. And look, a lot of the new charr armors don't have tail issues. Wow! It's almost like consumers can actually impact the thing they are spending money on by providing feedback! They've done plenty of retroactive changes to this game so I see no reason why pointing these things should be ignored because they haven't been fixed yet.
---
It's still there! I keep GW1 installed at all times, log in once in a while to do a VQ then log out again.
---
Although I do enjoy your passion for the Vabbi meta too, you should keep doing what makes you happy :&gt;
---
Yes
---
If they havent fixed it yet, the mechanics only start for the final boss when you step onto the ship, but the boss is in range from one of the small islands before getting on the ship and can be killed easily.  The boat is a trap.  Akhbar is needed for this fractal
---
I'm confused on how to get participation credit. I did a full dragon's stand earlier and I have no completions done. Am I supposed to just get an achievement? A random chest? I got no idea what's going on.
---

-suddenly gets might, fury, quickness, and weakness, and confusion-

Requiem is pretty expensive because of all the sigils of nullification you need.
---
I was in this vid 😀
---
I just noticed the week-long bonus events, and it gives bonus boxes of good. What exactly the items i can get from them? Is there a super rare infusion drop like the last world boss rush or something?
---
So it's a bit like the world boss rush ones, with added materials and jewels?
---
&gt; Would you like for the crafting cooldown to go down from 1 day to 2 hours, as to reflect the in-game day time?
---
No. Charged Quartz is a thing since Dry Top was released. If you crafted it just on weekeds you would have ~100 per year. If you don't like waiting then go farm gold and buy this food/heat stone. This is other alternative to bypass crafting charged quartz.
---
Either you are patient and craft it daily or rich and buy everything.
---
Yeah, it does take hours sadly. i had an enormous stockpile of large bones i bought last halloween and that took ages to turn into curios
---
Uninstall Arc and reinstall it at every patches.
---
Grab them when they’re $15
---
Like the world boss ones, except without rare gear, but more and better materials (no more Copper Ore/Green Wood/etc.) and the jewels.
---
Pulling 17x Rugged Leather, plus other things, out of a single box is nice.  And you get 4-6 boxes per meta, depending on the meta you do.
---
Wow that's quality...underwear?
---
I heard they got kicked out for something like 3 years ago (or they just left the game).   
---
No proofs or anything just something I heard among the Mists.
---
Why is a change needed?  People who are looking for ascended mats can purchase them and people with excess mats can sell them.  A change in the time gate would drop the value of these mats  considerably.  Seems like a bad idea for the game, not a good one.
---
Maybe you mean [sunset jewel](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sunset_Jewel) or [Grey Market Black Diamond](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grey_Market_Black_Diamond)? Both of those can be exchanged for [Black Diamonds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Diamond). [Exquisite Ruby Jewel](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exquisite_Ruby_Jewel) is just the upgrade component and part used in jewelry.

"errno 2" is "No such file or directory"

Grab a copy of the arcdps.ini from https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/x64/ and put it where it says in the message

---
I'm sorry I can't think of any old content that's not being done any more, at least very very little of it.  Not sure where you're getting that from.
---
Well jeez I didn't mean to piss on your cereal there friend. I bring up tails because that's what the original comment was poking fun at and it's a simple example of something players pointed out that they have since fixed. I could bring up the entire HoT expansion instead if that won't ruffle your feathers so much. Nowhere do I see anyone bringing up the assortment of things you took time out of your day to present to me. Perhaps they bother you more than you are letting on :( 
---
Even then those complaints are justified because this is a forum to discuss the game and clipping issues are a part of the game. Who knows if all those complaints have led to greater attention from the devs when it comes to armor pieces clipping. Let's try to be positive! :)
---
I guess you gave up on the legendary item discussion but just another fun fact; people were pointing out the problems with the armor and trinket *before* they ever came out and there's still at least one new effect that is unreleased that is already getting criticism.
---
Every few months probably less than 6
---
Thank you! That actually worked, i would have not figured out that it was one of these small details that was messing it all up.
---
Ahhh that makes more sense! Thanks for the response
---
Thank you! Honestly, I had no idea what the trading posts were for 😅
---
Stop treating it as a grind, if you aren't enjoying exploring the maps and playing the game now, you won't. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If you are after vertical gear progression, look elsewhere.
---
I bring people into my maxed home instance just to hear their disappointment when they can't loot the enchanted treasure chest.  It sustains me
---
We have a cape, you get one from path of fire, when you have to choose a side, Amnoon/Sunspears/Joko
---
Though the cape stretches out sometimes and becomes really really long
---
I have a bunch of mini-pets (the ones that just follow you around).
---
Do I have to keep them in my bank? They're taking quite a lot of my limited storage.
---
that would be nice.
---
apart from wvw, which is still the most neglected aspect of GW2 with more untapped potential than any other, i'll habe to disagree with all of your points. sure, some older parts could use some polishing, or at least a reward rework, but other than that they are all still quite active and well received. just because they become the focus of attention during special events, they aren't automatically completely desolate outside of them. as for raids... you seem to have some very inaccurate views on that. they might be more challenging than open world pve... but it's considered end game content for a reason, and even as such the requirements to clear them come nowhere near top-tier gear.
---
Fuck man that’s a lot of gold just to spite people but you have my respect as that’s the last node I need
---
I guess I was blessed by the RNG God as I got 2 a couple weeks ago, but I opened almost a full stack of BL chests
---
I use it on my renevant/renegade and so far I'm loving it!
---
Yeah because it's funny to peep on women undressing, even if it is in game form.  WTF /Guildwars2 seriously?
---
Oh trust me, I'm not hating on the new content. The new mechanics are very creative and lot of fun. I just meant that the old stuff could use some love too. It just feels forgotten by the devs is all I'm saying.
---
Will come back at some point but they didn't say when.  No indication whether it would be soon or not.
---
idk if I agree with this. I like this game but find the 1-80 leveling experience to be painfully uninteresting and skip it every time with birthday boosters + crafting.
---
It's useful for things like Chrono, alacrity Renegade, and quickness Firebrand in fractals and raids. I'm not so sure that it's useful outside of those areas, but almost anything is viable in openworld.
---
You can find builds for these classes on metabattle and snowcrows.
---
I just got to level 80 and filled the mastery bar. I haven't done much of the story yet, so I don't have masteries unlocked. Am I wasting XP by letting the bar sit full? What do I have to do to unload the bar and start getting XP again?
---
I like both mounts in this image
---
Try doing the first two dungeons, see if you like those better
---
In general, doing hearts isn't terribly an interesting way to go about the game. A lot of the early game is exploring and learning your class, and getting used to the dynamic event system
---
 You\`re on the wrong reddit, try: [https://www.reddit.com/r/gw2economy/](https://www.reddit.com/r/gw2economy/)
---
Ohh didn’t think of that... I need to save them this year from Halloween.  I always say I’m on my last legendary then get the itch again and make a new one :)
---
I mostly wvw and filled five 20 slot bags with candy corn for gobbler xp boosts.  It’s June and I’m down to my last half of a bag.  I didn’t think to save bones.
---
Right click them and click "add to account wardrobe". Once you do that, if that doesn't already destroy them for you, then yes, you can just trash them
---
This has been a request for years, just as many as build templates....
---
Don't hold your breath, we will all be dead and buried before they implement capes.
---
Gw1 had capes ! just saying !
---
Cheers mate!
---
is there a common way to find home instance farm? I feel bad when using lfg to look for one cuz it feel very entitled, and i dont have the fund to give good tips
---
this literally only shows my Balth temple and nowhere else, I waited for an hour and a half last night with nothing happening wondering what the event even was...still says Balth today too
---
which events are included ? couldnt find this listed anywhere.
---
Like I said, my main point isn't necessary if it's still being done or not. It's that they have all this great content that's just mostly ignored by the devs. I've done all the games content (minus raids) I've joined active guilds and even created ones with friends. The issue isn't exclusively whether they're still being done or not, it's that they could use something to bring them new life whether in a big redefining way or as simple as just more enticing rewards.
---
was during siesta
---
 Nope, don't agree. I don't even agree that it's great content. It's dated content that everyone runs through as fast as humanly possible with every exploit known to man.  
---
Raids of course don't fall into that category. They're not ignored.
---
You need to swap which [mastery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery) you are working on or unlock the one you leveled. You'll need mastery points for the type that you're trying to unlock (Central Tyria, Heart of Thorns, or Path of Fire). You can see the achievements that give mastery points marked in your achievements tab with the corresponding mastery symbol (red, green, purple, respectively). Have you started on to the next [story](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Story) mission? Or are you locked out altogether with the game telling you to unlock the mastery system? 
---
Regardless though to answer your main question, you're just not going to see your exp bar fill up for [spirit shards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spirit_Shard) which you'll get a ton of later and are mainly used for ascended and legendary crafting. You'll still get spirit shards from other sources like random drops, daily completion, tomes of knowledge (though you should save them), etc.
---
i was late to path of fire and a lot of the metas i could never complete because there were always too few people, now im finally able to them and they are always waaay more active than ive ever seen.
---
PoF needed this so bad, wish anet didnt wait so long to do this.
---
Gear has never barred anybody from doing anything in gw2 except for high level fractals and even there is not that bad. Raids can be done in exotics just fine, and ascended gear is not hard to get, at least trinkets and weapons which have most of the stats.
---
Indeed, there is always the issue that most new content's income attrack too many players (humains go only for the easier thing that gives back the most income after all) and ArenaNet never ever rebalance old content to make it as much attrative as the new one. So it feels abandonned. 
---
Always interresting to see that Silverwastes is still so popular after all this time while Drytop feels a bit dead outside of the time it's its time in the dailies. And let's not speak about dungeon, while on the paper is on par (or even better) to what they were before and while have a small dedicated fanbase, they're mostly avoided by most players.
---
I can't do any of that, the masteries tab is locked out telling me to do some quests. I've decided to just deal with spoilers and do the PoF prologue since it seems short.
---
Do you only have PoF or do you have HoT as well?
---
Oh u right I was thinking of raids
---
I have both, the PoF is easier to do quickly though. The interface says to either do the 1st quest in PoF or the 2nd quest in HoT.
---
&gt;I think they made a huge mistake by ditching HoT's outpost model, together with map meta events. HoT meta events flow really well, and they could have followed something similar for PoF. Instead, we have multiple random events no one knows of, a fact that gets worse due to the increased map sizes.
---
They majorly nerfed the breakbar... a LOT...
---
out of curiosity, have you recently installed gw2hook?
---
Map chat was fun during this
---
yes, omg is that it?
---
That's a lot of precision. And 20 gems/mo is a great value.
---
[removed]
---
I'm pretty sure they said the point with dungeons was that they are not able up revamp it due to losing the dev expertise, and that they were always a cobbled together barely working thing that they didn't want to touch.
---
What they could do is make new dungeons from existing content, like all the wasted living story instances. They could take an old map throw two keeps on it and call it a new PvP or WvW stage.
---
I think it became a meme over the years because ANet have *repeatedly* said that the reason they won't do [*x*] is "because it would clip". The argument is often then, "but [pile of stuff] clips already. Come on."
---
&gt;trying to process thousands of individual non-static textures and particle effects...

I just see myself and a bunch of people wearing thief-like clothes.
---
Is 100 the maximum for boon duration?  Great tips, thanks!
---
Ah, gotcha. That's sad to hear. Although I wouldn't be opposed to your latter suggestion.
---
I use full Diviner's on my alacren + concentration sigil (scholar rune and force as well).
---
I can provide alacrity for 10 people in raids very easily. 10/10 highly recommend.
---
I'm in favour of the 'lots of Diviner's gear' approach. For speed running, Snowcrows suggest mixing Diviner's and Berserker's gear so you get just enough boon duration to hold the ship together while still doing as much DPS as possible, which makes perfect sense for what Snowcrows do, but in more casual groups it's pretty useful to have the extra duration to cover loss by imperfect rotation and positioning.
---
Cool. Who gives a shit if I have a thousand of an account-bound currency? Maybe I can actually make shit, then.
---
He can't unlock daredevil if he doesn't own HoT.
---
It's probably just some horny little teenagers upvoting it. I wouldn't judge the gw2 reddit community as a whole based on this one pathetic post.
---
Well there are also the ones without data.
---
You make a very good point there
---
Chilled to the bone is very good for PvP (stability, aoe stun, ect), but its not THAT bad for PvE, it causes chill which synergizes with a lot of traits and ontop of stun and stability, when used with augury of death, hitting 5 targets will only have a 58 second cooldown.
---
It’s so annoying in Open World tho...!  Pets always keeping you in combat when all you wanna do is mount up.
---
When I feel like meme’ing my Reaper around, it’s Augury + YSIM/Suffer/CttB all the way.
---
Sadly I did that - not enough, and through all the years I was selling them periodically when they reached 20-30 gold of value..... I just can't save gold in this game that is it
---
They took the only other hard meta besides TT and nerfed it in several different areas by HUGE percents. It’s absolutey astonishing and crazy honestly. Shit’s easier than even Octovine now
---
Not really. There's a pretty big difference between:
---
* Gen1 with collections
---
* Gen1 without collections
---
* Gen2 with collections (Astralaria, Chuka and Champawat, Nevermore, and H.O.P.E.)
---
* Gen2 with crafting
---
But within those groups, more or less the same.
---
So that's why nobody takes me up on the offer...
---
More important than whether those who already *have* Envoy armor can dye it to their satisfaction, though.
---
But then what would he cry about on reddit?
---
Yeah, it's never free. They always ask for 'donations'. Kinda like when you go to the supermarket and they have people outside asking for money, then they give you the shifty eye when you don't give them money because they know you have money to shop for food, but bitch, they don't know you have to look after yo'self before you can help anybody else, and they don't know your circumstances.
---
tl;dr: It's never free.
---
There might be a sale in August for the game's anniversary, so keep an eye out for official announcements.
---
If you don't want to wait that long, then use a site like *Is There Any Deal* to track the prices of [Heart of Thorns](https://isthereanydeal.com/game/guildwarsiiheartofthorns/info/), [Path of Fire](https://isthereanydeal.com/game/guildwarsiipathoffire/info/), and/or [The Combo](https://isthereanydeal.com/game/guildwarsiiheartofthornspluspathoffireus/info/).  The sites it recommends are all official retailers, just avoid Key Resellers like CDKeys or G2A.
---
Looks like Nuuvem currently has each expansion on sale for $18.  $36 total isn't bad, the lowest they've ever gotten is $25 total.
---
Yea that happens with dyes :(
---
&gt; maybe I am jaded and not putting as much effort into this game as it deserves
---
I can’t speak for you, but only for myself;  this game is very much all about what I put into it.  It is my main (and currently only) hobby.  
---
I’m raiding, doing guild missions. playing the new map, even just finished crafting every legendary weapon/backpack.  
---
For a long while all I did was daily achievements &amp; daily fractals and then logged off.  Back then I was growing more and more bored with the game and the monotony so I stopped doing all of that and went full distractable-puppy mode and just started doing everything again and it was a 180 on my enjoyment.
---
And I think the same can be said for raiding &amp; fractals.  I’m currently in a weekly static as a Druid but soon prepping to branch out to dps and let someone else take up the healer role and that should be a lot of fun I think.
---
- Yes.
---
- No.
---
- If you try hard, yes.
---
- Depends on personal style. Look through the wardrobe tab in the bank.
---
OPEN THE DOOR. THE PRECAST POLICE IS HERE. DROP YOUR FOCUS AND DONT RESIST.
---
&lt;3 power chrono
---
I like glacial axe + storm dagger but that probably gets disqualified by the "not super expensive"
---
Trololo xD
---
...what? I've literally never charged for home instance. If people *want* to tip that's their prerogative, but I've never asked because it's a 0 skill sort of offer.
---
Prior to the reset of gear with selectable stats, my asura thief "Shufflepants" was wearing all armor with marauder stats. Now, after the reset, my helm, shoulders, chest, pants, and boots are all stat selectable, BUT marauder's stats isn't an option. Only Berzerkers, Knights, and Rabid are available to be picked. I wonder if it might have to do with the fact that I think these pieces of armor were originally crafted or obtained back when there was a stat combination that had magic find on armor. And then when that was removed from the game, those armor pieces got reset to have selectable stats, but I left them unselected until after the marauder's stat combination had been added to the game and those armor pieces gained that as a selectable stat at that time.
---
I think he should be able to. I mean, yes, Muhammad/its spelling variants is the Prophet's name, but it's also a very common Muslim name with millions of people named after it throughout the world. It wouldn't offend any (sane) people, I don't think.
---
Probably a couple days, work on it for 2 hours then come back to it the next day with a fresh mind to finish it. I don't really keep track of time anymore i'm in there for many, many hours sometimes. I'm often oblivious to guild chat too when i'm in the guildhall because i'm up in the sky somewhere building scaffolding for all these track bits :D.
---
Both seem fun in their own ways. I feel like the Quickness Firebrand build might be too complicated though. Not really sure
---
🤠 this is not the content I subbed for :(
---
it's not, quickbrand is actually pretty easy, you just effectively spam quickness skills on cooldown (with some nuance of course) in the middle of your dps.
---
I personally like FB better, because I like the variety it has between support and dps
---
It’s free when I ferry people in to mine!!  I don’t think anyone has ever offered to tip me either - so it’s no biggie.
---
He is talking about NA, which is most likely a bit different, but probably not drastically so.
---
T1 EU is that not even active nowadays, maybe there are queues on some servers during prime times but ain't that many queues during the week on deso, unless there is a double wxp event.
---
There are guilds, roamers, gankers and open tags in every tier, although T4-5 may be less active overall. So there is usually plenty of content there, it's just that it's not very competitive PPT wise in T1 or T2, but it usually changes once the relink happens.
---
TV Show Season 3, I think it’s episode 8 but not 100% sure
---
LFG is empty because those groups are high demand and fill within seconds.
---
It already started
---
Will do thanks
---
There actually even was a guild for it on EU but dunno if it still works.

Also when you transmute legendary armour sometimes the effects still occur on those parts
---
how do i download a copy of the arcdps.ini? its not allowing me to download a copy....
---
The best way to get into raiding is to join a training discord/guild or find a semi-experienced static. Watch a few guides on the encounters to get mechanics down and practice your rotation on the golem. You should try to have ascended weapons and accessories but armour isn't so important so exotic is fine. Once you're  comfortable with the encounters you can use the LFG to get boss clears if you miss any with your guild.

16 gold. A true tragedy. How will he feed his family now?

Thank you!
---
I'm not sure I understood your question. Are you asking what zones are part of core Tyria?
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Map_completion
---
Vista , poi, hearths, Mastery points and every places with name on map, if you open world map, you have all listed in top left corner
---
Found the ironing board of a woman who probably identifies as a feminism!
---
I can't say I'm surprised :)
---
Have you guys considered having the FB heal instead ? Wondering how it would feel compared to chrono/tempest.
---
o_O???
---
It should be exactly the same as downloading the d3d9.dll file
---
You jelly because she has curves that you can't have/hit?
---
when i click it takes me here([https://puu.sh/DCj3G.png](https://puu.sh/DCj3G.png)) not sure why
---
in end game raiding (perhaps not in statics but idk, in pugs is the point) it is also very important to be able to adapt to any situations. You have to be able to continue your rotation regardless of what happens. (boss moves/phases/you get teleported/rez a down/apply cc)
---
I upvoted this post just because it would piss off people like you
---
I both agree and disagree, all mmos need a constant stream of new content. However they do also need to balance that with making changes to old content. 
---
My interest is mainly WvW and PvP and these modes do need constant attention and changes to keep them fresh. I wouldn't even regard this as just freshening old content but actual new content for those modes. Clearly Anet management disagree but that is just wrong on their part as the experience of other games shows.
---
You need time and dedication. And look for TacO routes or if you want old style just look for Map Explo Routes photos. I have them downloaded when they were still up. If you can't find them pm and I can give you a Dropbox/GDrive link for them.
---
Her forearms are looking a bit, uh, flayed there.
---
Known, but rare bug.
---
Can I say that it's a good thing?
---
yikes, dawg
---
Doesn't matter, both are penuts.
---
How do you feel  about fracs? I've had fun beefing up my gear just for them
---
People in pugs often tend to step out of your wells or otherwise try to actively void your boons. More concentration definitely helps
---
i wasn't planning on crafting vision at all, i have a couple of ascended sets and i can't really be bothered with legendary trinkets
---
Which doesn't mean that content isn't done anymore. At least on my server, I'm always playing WvW and I've played PvP without a long wait for a match. Someone must be playing.
---
And btw, he's not asking for new content. He's asking for old content to be revamped. Just recently two PvP arenas had changes. Seems to me, you're arguing against the OP who's not asking for new content.
---
You want new content for WvW and SPvP, don't you?
---
Don't be afraid to take time off whether it's 2-3 days off or a weekend and play other games.  It's important to keep GW2 fresh and that isn't always possible when you fall into a routine
---
Be flexible and try out different roles.  While I used to play a lot of DPS I've come to find idyllicly supporting incredibly relaxing.  It's nice to see fights from different perspectives. 
---
If you're not having fun then don't force it.  Raiding is social and it's important to have a good time and laugh. Try not to obsess over full clears if they come with a crippled social scene where no one really likes anyone.
---
oh got it, thanks
---
wHAT. I crafted multiple legendaries and never ever noticed, that the star next to the name means that! TIL :D
---
Ok.
---
Exact same bug happened to me on my asura
---
You'll need help if you want to learn raids. LFG training raids are often fairly low quality, and you'll struggle immensely to get experience on the harder bosses. You need some kind of guild support, whether a dedicated raid training "LFG guild" or an actual community guild with people who will help teach you. Ultimately, you will need opportunities to train on the harder bosses so you can properly learn them, and those opportunities are incredibly hard to find without a group of people helping you along.
---
In the meantime, the things you can mainly work on yourself are your rotation (as mentioned elsewhere) and fractals. Fractals are a great way to learn how to play a class in instanced PvE, and they have a very low barrier to entry (until you try to get into CM groups without credentials, but that'll be a ways off).
---
I didn't get credit for "Vision of Enemies: Warden Amala" despite killing her with the required item in the inventory.
---
Other players seem to have the same issue: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/burosq/is\_there\_a\_problem\_with\_vision\_of\_enemies\_warden/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/burosq/is_there_a_problem_with_vision_of_enemies_warden/)
---
Well there's 2 reasons. Why she spoke through caith, she actually couldn't talk for some reason and she wanted to prove her brand isn't like kralks. Why she spoke later is because the last episode was done in a way that, how the devs put it "were't sure if it'll be the last chapter or not", when they had to make it possibly work as the last part of LWS4 they decided to giver her her voice because they didn't have time to tell a story about her being able to speak and it would be awkward af dragging caith along with you the whole time just so she can be a "translator".

Straight up just use lich, 4 and leave. It's pretty underwhelming but the burst is great
---
on some classes the ranged/melee blocks basically shut you down completely. 
---
* mesmers need phantasms and they basically can only use half of them at all times. no workaround
---
* reaper gravedigger counts as both melee and ranged (first and later hits respectively), same for many other skills, gimping DPS a lot. scourge can't really do melee at all as there's no melee condi weapon
---
* ele can't equip two different weapons (engi can get by with kits)
---
and so on, the whole system is idiotic. they should've gone with the bounty mechanic at the very least, that is somewhat reliable (still ignores any kind of minion/pet/phantasms). overall, it's by far the most useless addition to the meta. I think the best solution would be aoe damage close or far, forcing players to change position, but not gimping any builds randomly.
---
oh no! 16 gold?! rip man
---
Inb4 the remaining staff at anet nerf and make the class easier. #chronotreatment
---
The ones with collection do vary more between each other though. It also depends on what you would consider tedious
---
I can only speak for female characters but aetherblade pants are pretty 'light' looking - basically yoga pants with a belt. 
---
Also phalanx chest is quite pretty and not too bulky or metal plated
---
Depents on the informations you can deliver. They just can't unlock accounts to everyone that claims to have "forgotten" his password
---
A true bearbow would also never merge with his pet
---
well if they would contact me i could deliver them receipts, or cd key for the expansion that i bought.
---
Briefly yesterday  during DS I used my alacrigade in diviner, while it was a raid build and oh got stomped frequently (lack of sustain without dedicated healer) I provided so much ala and other to random people around that it was fun! I'm trying to tweak it more for soloing and to pair with quickbrand. Impact you will do in open world metas is insane.
---
It's kinda funny how you often see people ask for it but when you offer it hardly anyone responds. Probably because I always state "almost full home". Then there are the odd few that don't find it enough(missing a few nodes plus most of the paid stuff). Lucky most people are quite happy. And for the people saying it isn't free. Mine is always free and send the money back if they do send some.
---
I wanna see a viable WvW build where targets are constantly moving, dodging and stunning you. 
---
:D
---
Rping smut in the first place is already not a good idea. RP itself is already painful to watch or participate in, eRP is just cringy.
---
* Black Lion expedition : 1000 gems
---
* Basic Nodes of Mineral : 800 gems
---
* Crush the dreams and hopes of random people : unvaluable
---
Suuuuuuure, me neither... It'd a petty and mean thing to do, wouldn't it ?
---
Last week as I got a ticket answered from the devs, they mentioned that due to a large influx of players, both returning as well as new accounts, there is a mass influx of tickets. That said, devs are giving their best to help each and every soul they can, and you might imagine yourself that not all tickets are the same, some requiring more time than others.
---
They will get to your ticket soon as well, as they might have a ticket classification due to it's importance. I would say in a working day or 2, your ticket will be addressed, for sure!
---
Have faith and a bit of patiance. :)
---
Fuck you for your speculations.
---
-reddit
---
Last time I experienced something like this, then a day after my vga fried itself, might want to double check your gpu whether other games performances are also affected.
---
Nerfed because players were having more fun than expected or intended!
---
Yes but snowcrows will not teach you any rotarion viable outside of raids except few very little exceptions.
---
thanks
---
Guild storage banners are scribing only. Banners you get from even rewards are probably equivalent of [commendations vendor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Heroes_Banner) ones (have not done events, and you cant sore those)
---
Bleeding is only 6% of damage here.
---
If you could cap condition duration and also run full grieving and some extra Condi damage, you can get that 6% up to 30%. But you'd lose a lot of damage from power in the process.
---
In general, grieving builds are decent on classes who have built in condition duration. Duration outscales condition damage quite a bit, so a stat combo which ignores duration is only viable if you get a lot of duration from other sources.
---
As far as I know, the only classes which can pull off a decent grieving build are the ones who have a duration trait for the conditions they apply.
---
Firebrand does burning well.
---
Weaver can do either burning or burn/bleed, both quite well. 
---
Berserker can do burning and bleeding.
---
Engineer can do burning and bleeding.
---
The main reason the berserker and engineer Condi builds aren't talked about with grieving was that they didn't do much power damage when you build for conditions, whereas firebrand and Weaver did a lot of power damage even in full vipers.
---
Not sure who told you the Boss Teleporter wasn't worth it. If you never do World Bosses, sure, but otherwise this can save you 5s or so per teleport, multiple times a day on multiple characters. Same for the Maguuma Pact Teleporter.
---
They both come with the added benefit of chat notifications so you don't have to huddle over the wiki page for event timers.
---
Very useful. Would buy again.
---
To clarify: it's most likely the Mad Realm skin, *not* the Spooky skin.
---
When you said about wings, I was sure that’s the one. (●´ω｀●)
---
“Did you do it?”
---
How realistic is perma slow in pugs? It does look like a fu n build to utterly break every power encounter ever
---
Let's assume you can do this on two character per day on average. That means it'll take you 16360 / 150 = 109.066 days just to farm the kralkatite.
---
you will like it more once you got all those mounts from pof they make a huge difference to game play
---
You are who you choose to be
---
Mount me like you mount your Skyscale :-D
---
I think the only issue is Doppelganger, the wait time between pre-events and it is way too long
---
Exclusivity? Please elaborate. How is raiding exclusive? Are you blaming arenanet for creating raids to begin with? Are you blaming the players who want to play with other players with similar skill level? If its the former. You’re an idiot what you are basically saying is “hurr durr why did u guyz spend dev time on those losers who also love the game just as much as me but probably even more”. If its the ladder, you’re still an idiot because why not just create your own squad and ask for people with similar skill level to your own? Ohhhhhh you do not want to play trash people like yourself. You want to play with the best, who would carry your stupid ass. Do you realise how selfish that is? Grow up.
---
Hey, maybe you’re there just to have fun. That’s cool. What about the other 9 people. Do you consider your needs above theirs? Selfish. Do you think you can play as braindead as you want, and when called out on it argue back like they’re in the wrong? Selfish. Is the pve community split? Well, who split it? Raiders who are constantly looking for new people or the casuals who demand to be spoon fed, their ass wiped for them and rather complain that they actually have put effort into anything? That’s called being a loser.
---
Where do you work? What position do you have? When was the last time you got a raise or heck even a bonus. You know why you have a shitty low rank job (im not sure you do even have job), earn small amount money. Because you act the same irl as you do in game. I bet 100% you act the same. Like an entitled brat. And just like in game, where you achieve nothing and are kicked from groups with skilled players, you are not and will not get a good job with good pay irl.
---
You need to rethink your mentality.
---
living under a stone? this is nothing new ._.
---
Hahaha I had the same bug a few hours ago.
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/iY8dbTr

I was toying with a Diviner build for solo open world/story/pug fractals for my Holo, works quite well I must say.
---

---
no
---
lol grats on your new pet you will quickly get enough xp and masteries to level all the mounts mostly just by doing story and opening up the maps its only a ball ache when you want it all at once, shocks me how many people i see moaning they cant get the good stuff without ermm playing the game lol 
---
and i completely agree they are better than most other mmo mounts also what a lot in this game overlooked when moaning about skins being cash shop is that in a lot of mmo's the actual mount is the cash shop item or at very least its performance
---
&gt;but lets be honest, who is seriously going to RP smut in a public channel...
---
Oh buddy. The things I've seen.
---
Yes, and as sad as it may sounds, I'd rather have him stay dead. Don't get me wrong, I liked his character, but you *need* to have consequences in a story, otherwise you cannot get emotionally invested in the story. It also applies in all medias and not only MMO or games. Why would you fear for someone when you know the previous 35 dead ppl were magically ressurected ? That's the huge difference in a story between "how the person will survive ?" and "will the person survive ?"
---
Felt more like this.. thing could talk to us all the time and chose not to, for reasons we are not privy to. I do not know where creators were going with this, but the only thought I end up having about Aurene is "kill it with fire".
---
Nice downvote farm Smelusive 😌
---
How I convinced a guildmate C&amp;C was the next legendary she needed :
---
"it has a nice skin, footprint, and all... but look at my backpack *proceeds to switch between the 3 baby tigers*"
---
Big dick economy
---
Yep. I agree. It’s a small, tiny hassle but a hassle nonetheless to open the Wiki timer. Even if you leave it open you have to Alt tab to it barring a 2nd monitor. It’s just a nice QoL item plus it teleports you to it so you don’t need to copy paste anything or find it in the map.
---
Chronos can give almost 100% with just well and shield 4, add in timewarp from one of them and perma slow is easy, other sources include, renegade, DH and druid ca 5.
---
This build is very strong in some situations, but it won't break any encounters because if you blow all your burst on the boss, and you wanna do it again on the second dps phase, your phase times will be ungodly slow, dh has way lower CD on their burst and can speed up every part of the fight, even outdpsing Chrono in fights where you can abuse gs5, or use one wolf pack from a stance share soulbeast to the DH advantage. 
---
That said, it is already meta in xera, because you only have 1 phase which doesn't require dpsing adds or champions. And if you have 7 Chronos, you can have perma quickness with 5 of them bringing timewarp. Recently it has been overtaken in MO by rifle deadeyes/boon thief, another boss with no phases, but the power Chrono strat still remains a strong second, even after the signet aftercast "fix".
---
I can confirm what others suggested already and want to add a tiny bit:
---
Elite spec of Warrior: Berserker got a little rework and the new burst skills are awesome. It's very satisfying to see that huge amounts of DPS happen.
---
Same, I completely missed them too ...
---
Stay away from the sheep!
---
What are the additional uses for Pristine Fractal Relics besides buying ascended rings? 
---
Looking to get back into fractals but I only have one of the potions...if I bought Fractal Relics with my Pristine Relics I would have enough to buy the other two potions with bare minimum Pristine remaining. I see I need \~3200 for Fractal God which is so far off it's not even on my radar at the moment...but what are the other uses for relics I'm missing?
---
But discretize builds are also made around perma quickness and alacrity.
---
Legendary Light armor suffers from HAVING a skirt.
---
My record was losing 6 players between Wyvern and Qadim.
---
It's been pretty easy since PoF actually. Powercreep made all bosses easy to kill with only a few good players.
---
All we need is a short skirt with a cat tail.
---
yeah firebrand hybrid makes the most sense, especially with runes such as flame legion or baelfire
---
That's correct. I finished my collection and wanted to help someone else with theirs since I had spare charged quartz.
---
Wait, you say dye channels on leg armor are unimportant, cause "fluff", but the only thing you ask for are dye channels (just on weapons)?
---
for fractals fb only needs a potion to get enough boon dura for perma quickness
---
I haven't noticed a change in the amount of drops.
---
My list:
---
*mistlock sanctuary pass, or any other passes, but I like the mistlock sanctuary one
---
*shared inventory slots (I put my infinite gathering tools, Salvage o matic, mistlock sanctuary pass, living world books, whatever you feel convenient to share with your alts)
---
*Bank storage or material whenever you feel you're stuck
---
You can check full list on wiki, but I think they are used for stat selectable gear as well.
---
I was checking builds for mesmer about 2-3 months ago and for power dps there was build with phantasm Defender and disenchater, and the numbers were about 32k dps and rotation was complicated so much i decided to roll stats for diviner and go with support, this rotation and high dps is news for me :)
---
No no change, the quantity of the item was always bound to rng and the amount of items is the same as before.
---
Okay, I'll give those a go next time. Thanks for the advice ☺️
---
So what your saying is raids are equal in difficulty to other PvE content?   
---
GW2 raids are piss easy compared to other games yh, still hardest PvE in this game along with high end fractals.   
---
Not to mention your experiences with shit groups are your own problem and everybody has different experiences, doesn't excuse giving away free legendary armor for even less work. Try getting into a guild or finding a normal group next time, this has 0 shit to do with this topic.
---
With a hood that can be up or down. That would be cool.
---
I thought about that, but then you would have all the people who enjoy having shoulder armor complaining that they couldn't have their Houndskin Mantle or the Exalted shoulders.
---
Player Names "Off" does help a lot , at least i can see where im stepping, that aside with all that clutter ,and if it wasn't for the skull marker , one cant even see the Hoe btw T\_T
---
It's also not fun to kill people, but we do it anway.
---
How are the cauliflowers doing ?
---
No it doesn't. It looks too flashy.
---
Moot is a easier one to craft cuz its cheaper. Same with the harpoon gun, the spear, the trident, and Quip
---
You know, I had a whole thing typed up, and I'm sure it's been said before, but there is a lot wrong with the current benchmark system. This is off, and "inflate your ego" in so many ways.
---
Edit: I wish I could play chrono that well though
---
&gt; You are just putting words in my mouth about legendary items.
---
No I didn't, I listed all 3 typical complains I know the community has about legendary gear for the sake of completeness. All the "you"s in that section were meant to address players from the community in general.
---
&gt; For not being that invested in the conversation you sure are typing a lot.
---
I could've bet real money that I'd get this kind of a sentence in your response. I type a lot, because I want to get my thoughts across in such a way there there won't be any space for ambiguity or misinterpretation. But I'm not invested enough to go combing through the entire subreddit to find links for you, which could take multiple hours and may not even bear fruit.
---
&gt; This entire argument is you believing that people shouldn't complain about things because you deem them unimportant.
---
I have no problem with people complaining about things I don't care about. My problem starts when they keep complaining for years even though they see it accomplishes nothing. But you'll just respond again with a hypothetical "but the complaints could've had an effect on how things currently are" - which is not something we'll ever know for certain - so let's keep on wasting our collective time and nerves doing the same thing over and over for the odd chance that it works.
---
In a few years, when we still won't have aura slots, trinket hiding and dyeing, legendary PvE armor still won't be fixed etc etc etc, I will for sure be as annoyed at the community constantly bringing these topics up as I am right now about clipping complaints.
---
I really wished they didn't cut it, as it was the Nightmare Court lane. HoT needed the perspective of the Nightmare Court.
---
Iboga it is
---
That's very likely not the reason you got banned. Reports are rarely being investigated at such speed.
---
Wait really? I didn’t know that, now I’m upset. I really would’ve liked to see this
---
As someone who argued vehemently against mounts because they're always done so poorly, I have to say Anet knocked it out of the park with the mounts, it actually feels like you're riding it (skyscale's movement is not as clean sadly).
---
Iboga
---
No
---
&gt; I believe I named it 'Karen'.
---
Perfect.
---
I'm working towards the skyscale and waiting for a nice skin for it to come out. Once it does, afking in LA with it is the true endgame!
---
Until the next mount comes...
---
[Even timer page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers) has them but if you want the ones for the new event try [this page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Meta-Event_Rush).
---
It's the only time I can recall that I've written/done something that could be thought of as offensive, and if it turns out that I've done something that I just can't remeber I'll happily take the suspension for my behavior.
---
The system flagging it and automatically issuing the suspension was also my theory.
---
I just feel that if it's that, they should at least take a look at the enviroment the offending player is in, along with who's actually present for the offense.
---
You clearly ran into the wrong people.
---
Good ideas with the bounties. You can always start your own squad or mentor tag.
---
Yea, the brandstorm was a nice gimmick at first, but now it's just annoying. Didn't we unlock an account-wide immunity to it at some point?
---
You get a automatic respons when you make your first ticket, you can (and should always) reply to this ticket and add this info for faster handling. 
---
Don't make a new ticket always update the old one. Or that is also a reason why it takes longer.
---
I don't think I ever had an ascended item drop from HoT metas. Recipe books on the other hand...
---
I appreciate that we can get amalgamated gemstones from PoF as well now.
---
It's the complete opposite for me. Well, to each their own
---
Maybe one day when Dragon Stand gets less populated ANet will hopefully update it with 4th lane.
---
Woah, never seen this. I only used mount bugs to do afk farming from safety of inside rocks or walls.
---
Yes, in fact it has put me off the game completely. I have nearly 2000 hours in the game since launch, so I obviously enjoy it, but this has been the thing to convince me to take a break entirely. I have completed up to the jumping puzzles in the collection, so I don't even have that much\* left, but the thought of having to grind for days to get the map currencies has made me ask "Why am I doing this? This isn't fun." The process isn't fun, or rewarding, or necessary. It is twice as long as it needs to be with forced stops, ridiculous fetch quests, and absurd amounts of "find the pixel in the map area" requirements. I enjoyed the griffon quest, and did the beetle quest, reluctantly, and they were tedious but manageable. This is on an entire other level of ludicrous faux-content requirements. My breaking point was wait 24 hours to click the number 2 button 4 times, and wait 24 hours to do it again. I have made a legendary, I have sunk real money into gold to complete many of the more cosmetic reward tracks. But this is beyond that. The majority of opinions I see is, "Yay I made it through it." Congratulations, ArenaNet. You've made content people have to force themselves through. That's not what I want to spend my time on in my life right now, and thus I am sadly moving on to other games.
---
Yeah, it's the weight behind them and their movement that's so great.
---
Wow has many mounts and a lot of them look cool, but they all feel the same.
---
I kept playing until half a year ago.
---
source: i'm the guy
---
It was an accident, no idea how or why it worked. I sadly had limited time because of the map reset on Dragon's Stand or else I would have recorded a bit too.
---
Ban in 3..2...
---
&gt; For legendary weapon (twilight) you need 90 days because of time gate
---
Ehm... I crafted Twilight within a week. I must have missed something.
---
Iirc, they don’t automatically suspend for chat.  They only act on player made reports.  This means at some point someone reported you and anet took it seriously.
---
Not too long ago Dornsinger made a mention on reddit of just how seriously they take reports for things that aren’t even swearing like “kys” (stands for kill yourself).
---
My guess is you just don’t remember what you said or don’t think what you said should be suspendable.
---
If you consider it "wasted time" perhaps, but for some people the journey is part of the fun and the time spent crafting, gathering is not wasted at all. And where, if not in activities we do in our "free time", should we be allowed to "waste" time instead of maximizing some imaginary return per unit spent. 
---
I'd also imagine that for a lot of people (maybe most) the joy of owning a legendary weapon is greater if you didn't just buy it off the TP.
---
Nope. I am fine with having the ability to ride a raptor immediately. It has never diminished in value, or in how much I use it purely because I didn't spend 7 days "growing it." I just get to enjoy it immediately. Let's get rid of this "working for your mount gives you a sense of accomplishment." crap. I don't need fake, video game accomplishments to complete myself as a person. I DO, however, need the limited time I can enjoy games to be worthwhile, and wasting days doing absurd pixel finds, grinding hearts for currencies, and pressing the number 2 button 4 times every 24 hours for three days straight is NOT an enjoyable experience, or what I would consider "content." It is a mindless time wasting, mobile game tactic of convincing you to keep playing the game for a carrot. Give me the SkyScale during the season story, as a celebration for overcoming all of the trials and tribulations over the season, if you need a reason, OR make it consistent with previous mount reward tracks (Griphon), which I didn't mind. Let's stop this delusion that we given so much more to do this time around. We were given a meaningless scavenger hunt, with timegates, that some people like to justify with terms like "immersion," and "accomplishment."
---
my two full diviners chars are scrapper (flamethrower, not optimal but fun, perma quickness, 25 might, perma fury, perma stab) and firebrand (hammer quickness, using heal mantra for quickness, quickness on aegis application and lesser symbol of protection; overkill on the prot; but i wanted to use hammer so eh)
---
meta on chrono (pve) and renegade (wvw) but i dont run diviners on either of them
---
i see your point  with Gold farming vs Material collecting. 
---
yeah it is cheaper to invest your time in gold farming rather than waiting on collecting all the resources and waiting at events plus time gated materials. 
---
some people will make the point why not just make gold with excess materials but it goes against what u said about Gold farming vs Material collecting 
---
i hope i understood the point.
---
* 2 from the Blood requisition. They only ever give 2 stacks.
---
* 4 from from the Draconis Mons requisition. Only Istan has utility recipes in S4, but this shows Dragonfall currency, so the bottle must be magnanimous maintenance oil from S3, they share the same icon. 
---
* So the last 3 must come from the Dragonfall requisition.
---
It's possible to get more than 9. If you select Istan, you'll get 1-5 Corsair utility items. It's a massive saving if you actually use those, since it takes 25 kralkatite to craft them, and getting it it's kind of a pain.
---
But.... the jenna's mini's ;-;
---
You refine them into planks and those into spirit wood.
---
The rest you put in the bank and personal guilds if you run out of space in banks. Each character can also have 320 space with all bags maxed. Get 70 characters, keep 9 for playing and 1 for weekly key farms, that's 60x320 possible space for keeping your stuff away from other people's dirty fingers.
---
Just keep all the materials  you gather and sell them on the trading post (auction house) or use them to lvl up your crafting  whenever you start. After the main story there's a recap of season  1 living world you can watch in lions arch since it's no longer available, season 2 leads up to the heart of thorns expansion  you can purchase this one for gems or you can watch a recap on YouTube, after that you can play through heart of thorns and after that's finished season 3 leads up to path of fire and after that season 4 is the most current  content and its finale  is where everyone  has left off. If I were you though I'd take my time and try to learn as much as I could while playing  through everything  if you rush through trying to catch up you won't get to savor the content  as you go through it. Have fun
---
that was the most compelling plot point to me in HoT, so of course they completely ignored it
---
I crafted legendary and sold it, making nearly 2k gold profit. So....one can probably say that market was not settled down enough :D
---
That's the Mad Realm raptor skin.
---
It's the best skin if you want to make something so bright it can hurt.
---
When you buy it off the trading post you're paying for the time needed to do map completion and for all the account bound resources such as obsidian shards
---
Yes, they need perma baby skyscales. 
---
Also, they need to have your own skyscale in there when you aren't on it. 
---
That's actually something I thought about while doing the quest, they should set up areas in there for each of the existing mounts, places where they will hang out when you aren't on them. If you summon the mount then it vanishes from its "stable" and appears under you, but otherwise it's just wandering around in a certain part of the map.
---
And the Skyscale is not a replacement for what the Griffon offers in terms of an aerial mount. My advice, do the griffon instead.
---
What i do is as soon as the portals die, I just waypoint back to the staging waypoint and it's a quick mount skip over.  I'm usually the first one on the boss doing it this way.
---
Whoa! Thank you so much 😭
---
&gt; Prior consent is a thing(and isnt uncommon to arrange RP's before they start), you can do whatever you like in private channels such as party/whisper so long as all parties do not mind.
---
You can't, even if all involved parties consent to it. Here's an excerpt of an E-Mail I've written 2 years ago, asking about whenever ERP in private ie. whispers is an issue. I've done this for a few mmorpgs, don't ask why.
---
&gt;Inappropriate language will be reported and actions against your account may be taken. In regards to your questions:
---
1.Players can role-play to their hearts content and role play is encouraged. As long as nothing inappropriate (consensual sexual roleplaying) goes on, you will be alright. 
---
2.As long as everything is above board, you are perfectly fine. Otherwise suspensions can range from just a warning to 48 hours. If you have been suspended multiple times, it may lead to a permanent suspension.
---
If people aren't stepping in your wells, it doesn't matter how much boon duration you have. If you have 0 or 100% you get the same result.
---
If we take twilight as example:
---
* Crafting ~1500g
---

So by those numbers alone, crafting is cheaper. But, as you said, it doesn't factor in the time spend of the player crafting it. But how do you measure time and what value do you give it?
---
You can't really because everyone has a different perspective of it. You could find a gen 1 precursor when you are lucky or get one through the legendary crafting. Two players can have a very different experience and spent a very different amount of time to get the legendary.
---
You are playing the game, you chose to work for the legendary and therefore you don't "waste" time crafting the legendary.
---
If you really think that way you probably shouldn't have started the process or reevaluate why and how you play the game.
---
This an alt character. Has more bags on my main. I admit I don't care about organizing them though :D
---
My Hammer Spell breaker love it. A weapon with quickness relate sigil and diviner Trinket. Very easy to land Fierce blow after an interrupt.
---
Thanks! that sounds like a good plan! I will try Istan then.
---
Yeah - what I'm saying is that the correct build already accounts for people being slightly off. I think that we were trying to say the same thing.
---
I'm not suggesting that you don't take any Diviner's gear on Chrono - quite the opposite. I'm saying that you don't need to go full Diviner's to maintain permanent boons (even with pugs). Snow Crows' recommendation already allows for a lot of kinks in the fight or the players.
---
There are a couple of runes where the 6th bonus is some kind of stat conversion. For example the Wurm rune has "7% of vitality is converted to ferocity".
---
How does this work exactly? Does the stat conversion takes into account all of the particular stat (e.g. total accumulated vitality from gear, runes, food etc. in this case), or just the base vitality?
---
Yeah, they aren't as menacing in PoF, but they can still sneak on you and drop your HP fast if you are not paying attention.
---
In GW1, with a good party of mesmer hero/companions, Hydras are fucked. I use the Z-way and it's so strong against Hydras, I was really impressed the first time.
---
Cool! Thank you :)
---
I am also certain that the ogre lane in TD would have been the Nightmare court area, since the Nuhoch and Ogres fill the same niche of big lumbering primitives, while Nightmare Court using Chak weapons and Armor to shield themselves from mordremoth would make a _lot_ of sense.
---
I was joking.
---
I have to correct you here since you might mislead others. My first number was higher than any of the current benchmarks and the best i have gotten with this was 49,5k. About the precast, it’s just something i tend to do when i’m playing chrono so i figured i’d include it.
---
definitely. it is just that i dont have a goal to collect legendaries. gw2 can be played in many different ways.
---
As much as I really would have adored to see that lane, DS was complex and difficult enough at the start, and this probably wouldn’t have added enough to the overall experience to be worth the production cost. Now that everyone has the event down pat and you rarely see a fail map, it would be so awesome to see that revisited. There’s a lot of little things that I would love to see polished/finished/revamped. If only it were cost effective :/
---
What makes you think I would do something as borign as repetitive as 'farming'.
---
Not even in Gw1 I wasted a second farming. I filled the Hom 50/50 without a single second wasted away with boring farming builds or spamming in kamadan.
---
That would be amazing. I’m sad I can’t play those little games anymore. It’s cathartic.
---
no we need capes
---
Doesn't matter. If you sell my stuff others will get it. That is not acceptable. It my stuff, not theirs. If they want stuff, they should get it themselves.
---
I run my Firebrand with ascended Diviner trinkets, and I'm running a renegade with full exotic Diviners.  Both builds are a lot of fun to run in open world.  You'd probably get good mileage running it with Chrono, Engi, Ele, and Warrior as well, but I don't have personal experience doing that, so I can't say for certain.
---
This really seemed to me like it WAS that change in direction, and I’m curious to see what else they can fit in there.
---
I like that theory. For me, they went to be someone else’s glider, tho, because I can’t afford one right now hahah.
---
Mini Jaguar Cubs can be used in the mystic forge with other 3 master minis to get another random mini of mater or higher rarity.
---
The ones that can't be used are those that are too easy to acquire, like those from the eyes of kormir wishes or mini jennahs.
---
1: What does this have anything to do with your initial comment?
---
2: What does this have anything to do with what I said?
---
3: "Farming" comes in many forms...not just repetitive grinding.
---
How come it takes you 10 min to craft deldrimor/spiritwood? I take longer to relog onto my crafting char and go through the loading screen than crafting those.
---
Well I didn’t know that it was not on a timer.
---
Like Deimos :P only some are, so just don't do it for benchmarks so you can compare to others. You can still do it in Raids where it works.
---
Alright, then there should be no concerns with taking that system and implementing it for PoF metas!
---
They completely ignored virtually all relevant lore threads for the region and setting.
---
I get the feeling they developed the maps around the meta's first with a vague idea of threads they needed to deal with the egg and leylines, Then realised they couldn't fit the story in it because of missing out some important landmarks that should have been included and just threw the "oh no we have to find our friends fast" story in last minute.
---
There are some big lore questions that needed to be answered in HoT and some plot points that should have been addressed.
---
I’m just addressing your specific request. Yes, I agree that it’s frustrating to be in a map that isn’t doing the Blitz. But asking for a timer change when a timer doesn’t exist in the first place isn’t the way to go.
---
When you create a sense of loss,  people are more inclined to purchase it.
---
create the sense of desire so you buy it the moment it comes back same with outfits and mount skins rotations 
---
marketing 101
---
Technical you're right the term doesn't fit. My point was the calculation not the term for it tho. I edited it to say "oppertunity cost.
---
Yes, I didn’t know that so that’s my bad here
---
Ohh it'd be cool if they made it a new mini-map or something
---
If it’s only a few minutes after the normal scheduled event start time, that’s fine. If it’s :20 past the hour and people show up hoping to snipe that Piñata, that’s understandably too late to start a new Blitz cycle.
---
The 1h CD makes it less useful - independent from the fact I still have about 200 teleport to friend
---
That doesn't make any sense.
---
would’ve been more than possible to address everything in LWS3. instead, they added more plot threads and funneled the story into PoF 🤷‍♀️
---
It's an intance or area located in every big city, that only you can access but can invite players in your party. You can also buy farming nodes among other things, that will get located inside. So some people with maxed home instances, which means they got all the nodes available, will invite players to farm. Sometimes it's the other way around, usually players asking in map chat for someone to invite them in. Now, if you farm a whole maxed instance, you will get around 1g plus some change up to 2g+, so if you ever tip, don't tip more than 20-30 silver tops.
---
I misunderstood your comment
---
There are only 4 time gated legendaries - Nevermore, Astralaria, H.O.P.E., and Chuka and Champawat. These are collection based and cannot be acquired any other way. 
---
What you're talking about are the gen 1 precursor collections. The large majority of these collections end up being [more expensive](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/legendaries) than if you were to just buy them from the TP. Even the few that are cheaper to craft than buy, as you said are time gated and the savings aren't really worth it. 
---
**Legendaries are 100% always cheaper to craft than buy. Precursors are not.**
---
Free stat selection and rune/sigil swap all the time is pretty good...
---
 xD jumping puzzle are fun! Take your tea or coffee and start. But there are to many JPs in which you can use mounts. I miss the good old days with hours and hours of trying for a few AP. I would like it if anet implement better rewards to it and make more legendary collections in which you have to run this JPs ofc without mount.
---
I mean, we also know there is a whole fight phase that we missed out on too :( 
---
I was sad that dragon's fall only had a facsimile of dragon's stand
---
I love finding unused areas like this.
---
I used to have a friend who would constantly try to get out of bounds and find all these secret inaccessible areas.
---
He even found a cool secret lab in celedon forest
---
Play thief. Press 1. Congratulations, you can comfortably dps for 99% of raid groups.
---
I can show you if you're on EU
---
Really? Do you have any pictures?
---
No :/ I shoulda taken some.
---
It was cool. You had to clip through the ground and swim to it.
---
For some reason under the map is all water
---
Fire brigade is super rare in pugs aswell, and just ask the druid to always use ca 5 and Chrono to bring delayed reactions/lost time. Shouldn't be an issue, even in pugs
---
Wanting to know the exact reason I was suspended is wasting their time? Okay then.
---
I will but that's a weird way to mod as there have been posts about bugs that made it to the front... like this one
---

Seems to be the case.
---
https://youtu.be/uo1ovudAnx0
---
Aurora&amp;Vision disappear when you die and you need to reequip them. Happens with either of the legendary trinkets alone or combined. Also being told that it happens without dying where it'll just randomly disappear although I have not noticed that personally.
---
what is the point of this post? you already answered you question
---
yeah, exactly the same for me in Dragon's stand
---
I think they made invisible walls around the place after mounts became a thing so you can't get there anymore, but here's a video of an unused jumping puzzle/lab in celeadon : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyQucH0skl8
---
Maybe it's the same place.
---
No, late start of casino blitz would mean that there would be no chance to actually complete the event on time, thus all those people would be doing event destined to fail anyways. This is way worse outcome.
---
Better be early :)
---
for the zenith skin, will it go to my wardrobe? if yes, so my first transmute is free?
---
Replace the clown with Lady wisteria and me hiding behind with the water pistol.
---
any game recommendations? I have tried all of the top MMOs but Gw2 is the only one that's enjoyable in almost all aspects. I would have loved FFXIV, if not for the HORRENDOUS combat system which i cannot figure out why people actually like it lol.
---
There are 2 areas that got the axe: [Thorn Hollow](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Thorn_Hollow) and [Deserted Coast](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deserted_Coast). I think you were in Thorn Hollow or maybe both since no one has mapped those areas. Grats on that
---
I've never ever done that to a random stranger I invited into my home. Nope never.
---
Some items can’t be salvaged. Most likely this is what you’re dealing with.
---
For item that can be salvaged, the Black Lion Salvage Kit will indeed yield the upgrades.
---
Which exotics are those ? Some aren't salvageable at all.
---
Some items, mainly leveling rewards, are not salvageable. I’m assuming this is what you mean by it not working.
---
There are a few exceptions to what can be salvaged. Equipment bought with karma, some starting gear you get from level ups, etc. The full list [of what can't be salvaged is on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Salvage)
---
Honestly, I'm going back to Path of Exile for the new season starting tomorrow. Its not the same type of game, as its an isometric RPG, but it hits all of the loot, progress, and character development buttons for me.
---
 
---
# 😌
---
Well thank you. 
---
I'm also a collections and achievement guy. The difference is I'm retired, and due to circumstance mostly home bound so I have nothing but time. I've done the whole dad thing, and it was a valuable part of my life, but now, I only have to take care of my wife and dog...and my wife plays too.  Now if I could only train my dog to play. lol
---
It takes FOREVER. My next one is Pendant of Arah which is like 300g
---
yes, that's exactly what happens and it sucks
---
nope
---
As you say.  Marketing...
---
If Anet had everything in the store, people would pick the one mount skin they want, and not buy any of the others.  Rotations get folks to buy more.
---
On the other hand, when one really wants to farm up Unbound Magic, or Volatile magic, and one has to wait months for the unlimited versions to come back into the store, only to discover it was for one day only and you missed it again, and in the meantime yer messing around with farming Karma, porting back and forth, buying disposable tools, filling up your inventory with disposable tools as yer going through dozens a day.  Well, the frustration factor is high!  (And then eventually, when the tools come up for sale, you realize you no longer need or want them.  Anet's marketing strategy is leaving money on the table.)
---
There's actually a list of things like this.  Not just tools, but things like shared inventory slots, a lounge (specifically Mistlock with it's return-to-where-you-where ability), etc.
---
sadly it seems they just want to keep going back to humans and asura, 2 of the most boring races
---
They must not have phones
---
Folks just need to get used to traveling to locations early. As long as you get to the map before the Casino Blitz event starts you should be fine. Don’t hop into the map afterwards and expect to get a free Choya Pinata.
---
Sounds like you had a bad experience and made some absurd generalizations off of it. It's literally always free with me. When people send me gold unprompted, I return it. All I ask is that you don't waste my time getting into a big debate while I'm hosting you in my instance.
---
Memeorable
---
Dragon‘s Stand is what you mean when new maps are created after a certain timer, but the entire map is a meta event. But that doesn‘t apply to any other meta event because there are most times other big events ongoing.
---
Not to all content, of course. But Chalice of Tears took me more tries to do than any one raid w1-4.
---
I'll leave the raid pug praising to your own consciense. I think we all are aware how much fun pugging raids is.
---
You CAN get legendary backpack via PvE. Look it up on wiki. It's different skin but the same functionality. 
---
PS I think you are foaming at your mouth a little, might want to do something about that.
---
I left just after unlocking the glider for my Elementalist. I want to just back in but on a fresh character. 
---
Is there a rundown on different specializations play styles to help me chose?
---
&gt; create the sense of desire
---
Are you talking about pRen/hFB or chrono/hFB? As a group, we've considered neither, and personally I've put any thoughts about pRen/hFB to rest for the moment. Would be an interesting comp and most likely much more stable than the hRen version, but the guy with the only pRen in the group is also the one with the only PvE-capable hFB.
---
[deleted]
---
Interesting, so Tempest is the Elite specialization of a Elementalist then? 
---
The animations and chaining together of spells was pretty cool from what i remember. 
---
Sorry for being so vague! I might just jump on and create a load of different characters and see!
---
Ok, who freed Alex Jones from the Mists?
---
"stats used in conversions: armor, runes*, food, infusions, base stats
---
not used in conversions: buffs, class buffs, signets, traits*, weird obscure buffs*
---
runes: the new +125 bonuses added to the 6th slot on runes aren't used, but the rest of the rune stats are
---
traits: majority aren't converted, but a handful are (like the FB gm minor one)
---
obscure buffs: corruption (condi stacking sigil), thorns (rune of thorns), possibly some others"
---
copy/pasted from the last discussion of this I saw in SC discord.
---
gw2skills includes lots of things that it shouldn't when it comes to converting stats.
---
The reptilian race of winged fire breathing beasts living in the far reaches of Tyria. We have dismissed this claim.
---
&gt; ...stat change option...
---
Dont forget the ability to swap runes/sigils without losing the ones you replace. Plus being able to stat change when ever you want (outside of combat) is nice for players that dont have one character slot per build.
---
Tempest is one of two elite specializations for the elementalist
---
If you enjoy the animations, you might also enjoy mesmer as well. 
---
Go ahead and just try out builds though, if you set up a character and jump into the PvP lobby, you get the chance to try out all of the elite specs of that character as long as you have the expansions
---
I don't think anyone did. He's probably [still there](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Depths_of_Madness).
---
ERP is the real endgame.
---
simple, because that badge is still part of one of those systems that is character bound, and you can only do one world completion per character. it'd have to get changed to be more like the pvp badge first to make your suggestion plausible.
---
i basically follow almost the same build but use commander gears with leadership runes while carrying a shield w/ sword after GS. more defensive live longer lol. this is glass the hell canon. die in one hit. my recent play, hit hard, die hard, and boons up 100% of the time in T4. all other armor classes died before me since i have tons of toughness
---
That's literally the entire game. It's just a boring running simulator that you buy skins on the gemstore to look pretty in.
---
At one point there was regular endgame content and fun instances, but most of the dev teams have been disbanded and now we get like one raid a year now and that isn't enough to sustain players
---
A asura focused living world could be very interesting. Going in ungrounded areas where the asura race once lived. The central transfer chamber which primordus now left. The stone dwarfs. Dredge and skritt so much potential.
---
That would not explain the teleport to the entrance, not quite under the the waypoint.
---
If it was players teleporting to the entrance as everything goes bright white, they would use the waypoints and appear somewhere right under it but they appear a tad north, near the vendor. 
---
Also, all the helicopters that fell are suddenly back in the sky, and there's no trace of the bases and the waypoints transported there. There's lots of camp debris and broken waypoint assets from S2 without mordrem vines attached that could have been used to signify them breaking.
---
Honestly I would contribute to a GoFundMe for anet to finish DS. Even though I farmed the shit out of it back in HoT, I world love to come back and play it some more
---
I got the guild defender shield last night.  Was perplexed myself
---
shit you're right...lets continue circle jerking each other about how raid scene are dying instead of encouraging people to try raid ;/
---
He probably just thinks the Skyscale is a winged drake.
---
Faking Li to get into groups that want more experienced players is more toxic than people wanting to play with similarly experienced players.
---
If you gave a shit at all, you'd make your own group with, "anyone welcome" rather than trying to leech off a group that is likely similarly filled with other fakers.
---
This is why my groups only ask for experience. I avoid toxic players like you and get people who will stay for more than a single pull.
---
Now try it on a player who fights back.
---
Lol if you don't do raids then the "real" game is the exact same as the boring leveling experience. If you don't like running around spamming 1 doing unengaging events in low level maps, you won't enjoy doing the same thing in level 80 meta events either. It's the exact same gameplay loop, just in higher level zones.
---
For anyone seeking a real, engaging endgame experience - dungeons and raids are the only options, and those are both in a very poor development state. Fractals don't count ever since anet ben botched them post HoT.
---
You don't have to wait to be a mirage.  Once you have PoF, you can train for it.  You don't actually have to play the pof content.
---
This is the most accurate comment but sadly the hivemind downvotes you because deep down they know they are in too deep with sunk cost
---
^ Raid culture in a nutshell
---
In all seriousness, I don't think this post is for the auto attack spammers who dont understand how a choya could down them, I think its more for players who actually want to try harder game content but feel like its hard to break into.
---
Yeah I know, I am sorry. This wait time just seems much longer than most other companies for something like this. I am not complaining about the wait, I just want to make sure that nothing went wrong in the submitting process so I am not just waiting to find out I need to resubmit another ticket, ya know. Just wanted some reddit reinsurance :)
---
And the gathering tool
---
&gt;Why are raids strictly for elites with top tier gear
---
this is categorically false on all levels
---
Did you actively try to come up with the most toxic reply possible? If so, you did a really great job.
---
&gt; The only thing people like that should take initiative for is quitting the game
---
GW2 is primarily a casual game. If you don't like that, you're the one that should quit.
---
The best advice is that raiding isn't for them and that's okay. Some people don't like PvP and some people don't like a challenge. That's okay and this game has something for everyone.
---
You should probably take a break since this is obviously affecting you a little much.
---
Why do you ask?
---
I watched videos, learned my rotations, hit benchmarks, put in my homework so that I wouldn’t have to raid with pugs that don’t do those things. I didn’t get carried. I always pulled my own weight without “experience”. The community around raids is awful and it always will be.
---
I've been playing 100% quickness uptime FB through Diviner's for solo PvE for a while now and it's been a ton of fun. Handing out tons of quickness when I do open world group stuff is also neat. Been dabbling with perma alacrity Renegade in WvW as well,  which significantly speeds up taking stuff with my guild.
---
Am i sure it's the friend of my nephew who's autistic because that's the vibe you're getting?
---
The former are the ones who you see crying on reddit, the people who actually want to raid don't need to be told to take initiative, they just do it.
---
Man you must be fun at parties. How about let people play the game how they want instead of judging them, yeah? How does them playing how they want in open world affect you? None right?
---
The whole way they did tiered achievements/titles in GW1 was just a lot better. I don't know why they didn't do it with the same things in mind when it came to GW2. In the years since they've sort of reversed engineered it in a few select cases (like the birthday titles for example) but mostly we don't have title series for lots of cool things we probably should. 
---
Like, I'd love a title for completing "all" the jumping puzzles. And I get it, you can't have a title for that because what happens the next time they release a jumping puzzle and the title is invalid. But if it was GW1's system there would just be a title and it would rank up every X puzzles you completed, forever. Anet would just come up with the names up through far beyond the actual number of puzzles currently in the game, and then they slowly become unlockable as new jumping puzzles are added to the game. I wish this kind of thing was applied to so much stuff in GW2.
---
If GW3 is a proper sequel to GW1 I will actually pee my pants
---
its not east going against the circlejerk but someones gotta do it
---
&gt;and terrible attitude
---
I don't think mediocre pugs have the bad attitude here
---
Okay, hold on tight. Imagine you don't have one leg and someone tells you that best way how to get to roof is going via ladder. So you get ladder and have a hard time.
---
Same with builds. Use metabattle as an idea what is good but try to tweak it into your playstyle.
---
How can be meta build that you use andv understand only with 80% be better than your own build that you crafted for yourself?
---
Take the inspiration from others but tweak it for yourself.
---
I have 18 completions of core Tyria,2 of HoT and only 1 of PoF. Some motivation might be due.
---
As long as it's only transmuted, you're fine.  If you actually change the armour via the Mystic Forge, it won't be.
---
But since you can pick any stat type on the precursor armour, why would you need to put it in the Mystic Forge?
---
But they won't be raiding with you. Base on what you post so far, you probably expect people to do 100% of sc bench and have 1000+ li. this is why I add this point
---
&gt; (also don't join a group that have 250li requirement, since they already have a set expectation). 
---
your group don't have to accept them, your group don't have to do shit, just kick them a move on.
---
I love you.
---
&lt;3
---
xD
---
Hahahaha
---
Metabattle is not necessarily a noob trap either. They do list the most popular meta builds and otherwise, but it's down to individuals and the situation, mindset, etc.
---
A buddy of mine was playing a chrono power build he uses to wvw with, but obviously it didn't go so well in pvp. He swapped to a scrapper and did much better. (We're just going for the backpiece, it's long overdue really)
---
I ended up in mid plat 2 by mainly playing Soulbeast and Holo.
---
Have you ever made an LFG before? They absolutely will try to join, reading is apparently a difficult skill. 
---
Some even go as far as faking LIs, which becomes obvious after the first pull but still wastes everyone's time
---
Why do you think there is a major difference?
---
Then I recommend checking out the official forums raid section
---
I mean, if you're an experience PvPer and can actually make your own builds sure. But for the average Joe who only plays a handful of matches a week meta-battle builds *are* the best option.
---
The overwhelming majority of players lack the critical thinking skills to make good builds.
---
Well.. First i have some faith in humanity that this Video isnt just for Bragging to see that he optimised the current Benchmark, but that he improved the Rotation. And because i did not see a big difference im asking him
---
I think one of the most important things is learning to read the situation and the momentum of the fight. You need to be able to adapt, I usually see people focusing on doing something and failing but trying again without thinking what else could be done. Like fighting a scrapper holding a point while you can't kill it by yourself and just stayng there instead of helping, going one by one to a group of enemies instead of regrouping. Map awareness is the major flaw I see in people.
---
Guildie got 2 precusors yesterday. 2 * Colossus. At least that's what she claimed.
---
Just play one for a while.
---
If you block à Mesmer burst they have nothing left, then you can wreck them.
---
There are 10 players that can wipe and reset an encounter instead of 5.
---
we had rata novus in HoT at least 🤷‍♀️
---
it’s mainly charrs and norns that get shorted though, which really is too bad.
---
Thank you. So more of timing when to use certain skills, buffs, debuffs, etc. Thank you
---
Oh... I thought if you but PoF you automatically get ALL elite specs.. my bad 😅
---
Quick clarification. The way the cross-map data works, you have to log in to one of the maps where the community goal bars are displayed to get the community goal rewards. That would be all of the maps where the tracked events occur, or any city. And yes, once you've contributed at all you will be eligible for all community goal rewards.

Yes, I know that I can [gamble for precursors](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Forge_Stone#Item_substitution) with those, but I dislike gambling because it's gambling; and I won't be using [Mystic Salvage Kits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Salvage_Kit) because I already have the [Silver-Fed Salvage-o-Matic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Silver-Fed_Salvage-o-Matic) and prefer ultimate convenience over a couple saved coppers. So those 2 and a quarter stacks of Mystic Forge stones are essentially useless for me, even though they are supposed to be so valueable that they're sold on the Gemstore.

I think this is **the perfect chance for ANet to add a new use for Mystic Forge Stones by letting us to convert them to Ectoplasmic Stones** to reward those of us who've been logging in for so long that they could accumulate as much of this particular currency. Even if the new Ectoplasmic Stones cost several Mystic Forge Stones, it would still be better than just having them... there, sitting and taking up space.
---
time
---
So much this.  I'm hoping they fix it next expansion!
---
Not thinking about your build. Sure metabattle builds are good but why are they good? Who were they made for? Were they made for your rank? How can you make them better for your rank?
---
Thank you! I'll look into it.
---
Things have advanced a **lot** since the era of dungeons. The two popular end-game PvE options at the moment are 5-man fractals and 10-man raids.
---
Fractals are your 'farm' content, a series of trash mobs, minigames, and the occasional boss. They're intended to be handled by a group of 5 random players with a vaguely-decent team comp. There's a daily achievement category for fractals, which helps groups assemble for each day's content and means you'll get a bunch of variety in which maps are played each day. Fractals use a 'tier' system that lets new players handle easier content while you work your way up the ranks, so you can pretty easily jump in with any decent build at T1 and start playing.
---
Raids are the 'hardcore' content. They're a series of bosses for 10-man teams, each with a bunch of tricky mechanics to deal with. Raids have no 'easy mode', so the best way to get started is to find a training Discord server. Raid rewards reset weekly, so many players will join a static 10-man team with scheduled raid times.
---
I deleted my day 1 character after getting it to 80 because I didn't like how medium armor looked on Charr.  I made the same character as a Sylvari and re-leveled it up.  It's really stupid, but I regret it since my birthday presents come a couple months after everyone else that started day 1.
---
The time Nightfall kicked in and you finally got to Vaabi with your also new introduced heros. (Don't forget the grind for sunspear general as elonian character, good times!)
---
Then you got into this city as mission if you chose the npc for it and those delightful ruby djinns welcomed you with their searing flames... Don't get me started on the ruby djinn boss, first time around he destroyed me so hard I sat there with 60% death panalty and went back to the outpost because yeah.. no consumables to remove that shit.
---
10/10 would relive that again
---
Also, mechanically you can't solo raids like you can do dungeons.
---
&gt; some players of which have thousands of them,
---
I've been logging in almost daily since the daily login rewards were introduced and barely got over 500. I seriously doubt it's even *technically* possible to get 1000+ of those. And even then, it would be a drop in the ocean.
---
&gt; So no. Ecto needs to go back up.
---
Why? Because people who farm like zombies want to sell them for more gold?
---
I want to finally *use* Ecto to get the new armour. To make legendaries, maybe even the new trinkets. To upgrade backpacks. To make MF mesmer skins. To upgrade my guild.
---
Every time the cost of ecto rises, half the frigging game rises in price and forces people to reevaluate their goals, because selling ecto and just buying anything else becomes the best strategy. There are enough ecto sinks already, there are more worthless materials in the economy than ecto, and a one-time influx of Mystic Forge Stones will barely even make a dent.
---
A.K.A. "The Disney Vault"
---
You don't like pvp. You don't really pvp all that much. Why are you commenting in a post about pvp?
---
Doing 1 skill use right before an encounter begins and swapping to the intended weapon before getting stuck in combat is not unrealistic at all. I've been doing it constantly since 2014.
---
so that's where viserys ended up. looking good for a dead man
---
&gt; So you’ve got whipped cream
---
No. "So you've got those rare spices that only ripen like once a month and cost hundreds of dollars in the store..."
---
I Got 20 gold hammer exotic
---
Anet also wants to keep the .dat file somewhat reasonable in size. No one wants to face a 100 GB dowload if they just want to try out the game.
---
They did a good job at it so far, but that wouldn't exactly be true if we needed multiple variants of most maps in the game. Those maps would also be devoid of players, so what's even the point outside of a nostalgia hit? It would just give unnecessary strain to the servers while thinning the playerbase.
---
I guess it would be great for RP though...
---
22 hrs for 2 GoE, 12 hours for 2 GoB (I could have sworn the fastest time possible was 8 hours based on past bonuses and is now longer but I could very easily be incorrect on that.).  Thst gives us 29.41 gph for 2 legendaries (1000g profit / 34 hours)..  This assumes you have the obby shards, dungeon tokens and spirit shards saved up.  That is your best possible rate.  
---
Your worst rate is 24.39 gph.
---
Lacking tokens, spirit or obby will decrease your profit margins per set of 2.
---
WORLDS better than map farming alone.  DF has been betting me around 25 gph due to some good RNG. But that is only marginally better than your worst case.
---
Granted I'm always short on spirit shards and obby shards.
---
Play Renegade, gear you in viper, equip Mace/Axe, spam 2/3, gg easy.
---
Running into stacked Necro staff marks instead of dodging through them all at once.
---
They seem to be dropping frequently, this one exotic hunter torch dropped for both me and a friend in the first day and I saw its price dropped from 45g on the tp before the event to 24 when it dropped for me.
---
From a trader perspective cheap ecto are amazing.   
---
"New" players are selling theirs we stockpile to then sell them back when they inevitably need them. Markets exist and thats not the issue.  
---
Crafting is a huge part of this game and its woefully underused (and tbh mostly replaced with collections) as are most "new" materials. We have 12. 12 currency-materials spread over the same maps. Tons of unused materials from the expansions that were pretty much clutter on arival.  
---
The problem is that most players flood the latest greatest farm draining maps new players are exploring for the first time.
---
It's true there are some places there are some people still. Some madlads even do dungeons. But honestly if it wasnt for this comunity event right now could you honestly see a large group of players in ORR as often as you do right now?  
---
Because I've been needing Obsidian shards a few months back and we pushed the meta with barely 10 people using LFG.  
---
Reusing old materials rather than spamming new ones gets players back into these maps.   
---
It's one of the reasons im glad Anet stated they are leaving the new map per episode behind for future releases.
---
Please replace the image for 10/16 - it's horrible and the "alternative POV" is an error.

'I'd rather play content and get the rewards directly from said content.'  
---
In what way? Loot drops or collections?
---
Id agree with you if we didnt get that map update in terms of events like festivals and the crack on the tooth of Jormag. Id say in this case its more akin to a Flat Earther lol
---
The fact that I can't tell whether or not you're joking really just drives home how ridiculous this is.
---
Repeatable Achievements are never completed. They reset and count how many times you have repeated that achievement. There are multiple of these Bonus Event achievements because - you already saw that - some meta events give more rewards than others.
---
It depends on which meta you do, some give 4 boxes, some 5 and some 6. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Meta-Event_Rush notes which meta gives which amount.
---
Okay, I'm in Orr quite frequently and I have no problems getting any of the temples done ever. You don't even need 10 people to do the Temple of Balthazar, but why would you anyway? If you want obby shards, I have so much unbound magic I can buy that with (there's almost no other use for it right now once your guys are geared).
---
There's also airship parts, which are easy to get which slows down the drain on your karma.  I've taken that temple with five, six people before. It's not that hard, so you don't need 400 people to do straits. 
---
I'm also in Malchors and Cursed Shore frequently there are are people doing events there.  Sure there aren't as many as launch.
---
But that's not even what I'm talking about. The new currencies don't help Orr. They new currencies help LS 3 and LS 4 zones, and that's what i am talking about.
---
Look there's no game with a perfect economy. There are always going to be items in favor and out of favor. Drawing the conclusion that there's no intent at all on the part of the devs because you don't like the outcome, however, is just that...drawing a conclusion. You don't know how much is done intentionally or who is watching what, or the reasoning behind specific changes.
---
My point remains. The use of currencies to drive people to specific zones is effective and it works and it may not be what you want personally but it doesn't hurt my game at all. 
---
I'm not saying you're wrong to want what you want. I'm saying you're wrong to say that no one is paying attention because you're not getting what you want. That's a conclusion you can't draw.
---
Can crafting in this game be improved? Sure it can. But I can say that about most systems in most games.
---
It would be pretty simple to make 500 Jeweler worth something.
---
1) 500 Jeweler can craft a new kind of jewel, which has a vendor value of X, out of a stack of any material. This will put a floor value of X/250 on every mat. 
---
2) 500 Jeweler can create "Luck Enhancers". The first luck enhancer crafted on an account will cost 31000 luck plus something. The second one would cost 32000 luck, etc. Luck enhancers add 1% to an account's magic find, with the magic find cap changed to 500%. Luck enhancers would not be account bound.
---
3) 500 Jewelers can create stat-swappable trinkets (like Aurora and the others, but with no aura)
---
4) 500 Jewelers can enchant trinkets to have completely customizable stats, you would get a choice to have all power or condition damage.
---
For 500 cooking, I guess all you could do is have longer duration food, I can't think of anything else.
---
Right? Djinn are getting justice done for their design and power in gw2.
---
so. much. this.
---
also learn the damn map mechanics.
---
conversely, it has never been CHEAPER to craft legendary weapons or  armor.
---
I believe that might be what they are trying with the mystic forge community events.  
---
I curious to see if they will repeat it often enough to make a difference.  
---
That said the Mystic chest was a way better idea. The mystic forge bags were missing a decent lure like the portable mystic forge was in those chests.
---
I've never been asked to donate on NA. (Granted, I've probably only gone into 20 or so home instances that weren't mine.)
---
great post, but sadly reddit seems to care about the economy as much as anet and they are the ones who complain that we have not enough worthwhile things to do....
---
can I change the stats on the Caladbolg weapon by trading it for another weapon then trading it back to the original weapon I had using unbound magic? (I don't have the spirit shards to use the mystic forge)
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Home\_instance](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Home_instance)
---
I would still wait for jewel/cooking 500 and legendary rune/sigil crafting.
---
after that, get your pitch forks.
---
What about luminous prowler I’ve seen that be really bright, maybe with crushed bone or one of the glint dyes?
---
Quick jot here aswell. There were crazy spikes during John's reign aswell. It was the reason I started buying out merch price materials and relisting them for 2-4s.
---
Good luck, remember that dragon's stand has a time limit!
---
relaxed gathering runs around different maps was pretty fun *for me* back in the day.
---
So I baught both expansions on release, Although I sort of play on and off.
---
Interestingly enough, after completing the first zone, I never bothered to progress much further into the PoF content. I ended up getting busy with the HoT stuff, as there's quite a lot of content in HoT alone, and I just prefer HoT zones over PoF (but that's just my personal opinion), and I see a lot of people running it.
---
Renegade makes good use of it; I recommend mixing it with marauder's stats though, or something similar like berserker's and assassin's. I am by no means an expert but my own PvE renegade is a mix of diviner (trinkets) and marauder (armor) and works really well with lots of fun potential
---
He better have a line about phenomenal cosmic power...
---
&gt; When was the last time you sought out a specific type of node because it was needed for something you were crafting and not because you wanted to sell it for gold?
---
quartz for the SS collection.
---
The Reaper Necromancer Elite Spec requires the Heart of Thorns expansion.  I've seen new players reach level cap in less than 2 weeks, and from there can unlock an Elite Spec in 1 day by joining a "Hero Point Train".
---
Legendary weapons are mostly cosmetic, have the same amount of stats as Ascended gear, but also allow you to change their stats and Sigils at-will.  They are very flexible and provide Quality of Life instead of power advantage.
---
Structured PvP stats are normalized, so everyone is on a level playing field.  Your skill is what will set you apart, not your gear.
---
In my experience, Firebrand is a bit more fun while DH is a bit more effective when it comes to power builds. I tend to open world as FB but do fractals as DH, and pvp as FB bunker support. Depends on what kind of content you want to do.
---
That’s one of the key reasons I hardly ever pull out my skyscale, it’s annoying trying to land on a surface or get around, only to have it cling to a wall you don’t want it to cling to.
---
I promoted mine to level 50 bag opener
---
I have a set of unlimited gathering tools, but unless it's an LS3 or LS4 currency -- I don't gather anymore.  I get far more value out of daily fractals or weekly raids than I do gathering.  Even things like Freshwater Pearls or Maguuma Lily's are way down in price.  Even the days of going out of your way to do things like Orrian truffles, Snowtruffles, or Raspberries is completely gone.
---
I remember being excited about the new gathering nodes in PoF. Red lentils are and have always been 10 copper worth on the TP
---
Well it sucks a playable area got cut from being able to be accessed, however HoT is nightmare fuel and good riddance its not another place of potential death. I think if I recall there is /deaths command to see how many times you’ve died I can gladly say that, many of those deaths are HoT related lol
---
Reposting your ticket on a community run subreddit won't get you a response any faster though
---
Sunspear Outfit . You get it if you upgrade to PoF deluxe i think? Also unlock Lily Of The Elon.
---
Agree completely! I'm back after a few years off and I was stunned to see many multiple thousands of virtually all weapons and armor on the TP, and literally millions of units of resources. ANet should be abjectly embarrassed at this. It is utterly pathetic. Gathering and crafting was one of the most fun things for me to do in MMO's, and there is almost zero reason to do that in game right now. The worst part is that Anet is clearly and obviously uninterested in this, and it will never be addressed in a serious way. We will only escape this pathetic display of game stewardship until GW3.
---
I still don't really run them.  It took ArenaNet too long to re-invigorate them and many still have glaring stalls/bugs.  I have friends that have added a cocktail of 3-4 amalgamated gemstones to their daily reset runs, but I can't be bothered.
---
Cheers.
---
I saw some anet employee throwing shade at a guy faking being banned for gold sent by his bro, when really it was from a hacked account. So they do patrol!
---
The problem is how much value do you attribute to the account bound items like gift of exploration and gift of battle?
---
Nope.
---
&gt;4) 500 Jewelers can enchant trinkets to have completely customizable stats, you would get a choice to have all power or condition damage.
---
That's a very wild idea, i don't think it would be good for powercreep at all.
---
GoB and GoE together = around 450-550g. And are sellable on the reddit exchange if you cba to make the leggy yourself - buyer will give you all mats + payment, you give them the leggy.
---
Hope this helps.
---
&gt; (I don't have the spirit shards to use the mystic forge)
---
You can't stat swap Caladbolg in the mystic forge. Trade it in for another (or the same) skin is the only way.
---
Go outside.
---
Get a job.
---
Start a family.
---
Either way. I've enjoyed some collections quite a bit (like the specialization weapons and such)
---
Collections are best when they're not piss easy and require you to do something other than pressing F on things, and when they have clear tips on where you should go without having to /wiki them.
---
Hullo friends! I just wanted to explain my experiences regarding this issue--and I do believe it to be a bit of an issue. I frequently tag up for meta events (I'm Tempest Antura), and have been greatly enjoying this event!
---
However, I notice a lot of people saying that this problem is exclusive to pinata snipers. I assure you, it isn't. Before the very first round of the blitz even starts, there is a countdown timer warning players that the event will soon be underway ("preparations are being made"). If a map is spawned during this timer, the new map will not have a casino blitz at all.
---
Easy solution: just arrive before the timer. Sure, I get that. However, due to the twenty minute wait between Augury Rock opening and the Doppelganger spawning, the last few minutes of the Ascension meta overlap with that countdown timer. That means my team and I, who all want very much to do the casino events and not just snipe pinatas, often arrive to a map without a blitz; despite the fact that on other maps round one hasn't even begun yet.
---
I figure that the reason this happens is to prevent pinata sniping, so I really think the best solution (and solves another problem of the twenty minute wait) to rework how Ascension meta is timed, allowing people to complete doppel a little earlier.
---
Yes I saw. Perhaps it would have been better to say I don't think it makes sense for OC to be downvoted to the void
---
I've done a few winterberry runs and it's alright, but after 20 I'm already sick of it. Kinda the same thing happened with the dragonfall meta, but I need at least one of those scion weapons
---
There's a super easy ranged strat in which you don't really have to worry about adds. I've only done it once, so I'm not certain of the specifics. But you start by grabbing the chests and throwing them onto the ship as normal. Then, everybody /gg's. Instead of getting on the ship, you go to the north side of the ship—don't get on the ramp—and jut DPS the boss down with ranger skills. It's so stupid how easy that strat is.
---
alright, thanks!
---
Fractals have changed quite a bit since vanilla gw2. They're now the replacement for dungeons. AR got a slight revamp, rewards got super buffed, and there are like 5 or 7 new fractals since then.
---
cool, thanks!
---
I think Dragonhunter traps are deadly noob traps in PvP.
---
Instructions unclear, got a hooker pregnant.
---
Go buy cigarettes, never come back
---
Start playing again
---
Repeat
---
"Ogden's Hammer" guy disappeared because he logged out. 
---
We are the game the whole time.
---
They started doing it after LS1, likely due to the repercussions of LS1. Currently if you weren't there you can't experience that content and they didn't like that.
---
Farming, selling and buying the stuff you need is still the fastest way to get your stuff. And way faster than farm certain materials. 
---
You won't sell the stuff you need, even if you get them from farming, obviously.
---
&gt; This stopped being a thing since CoF p1 nerf...if you have even been playing the game that long.
---
That's 1 gold per day. Now you get 2 gold from dailies. 
---
Also the current state of dungeons is more rewarding than it was back to the 1g per path times.
---
To make you rush and buy it.
---
Made my day xD
---
Thank's man! Good to know. Appreciate your time, makes me feel a bit better and more confident about the wait. I know ArenaNet isn't as big as say Blizzard or Riot, but it might be worth it to them to up their staff a little bit, at least in the Ticket and Account Recovery area. If I were online I would probably be spending money on the Black Lion shop often. Mostly for Quality of Life stuff, but maybe occasionally for Keys and stuff.
---
Don’t get your hopes up too high, may just be like Aurora/Vision
---
But why do his hands clip? It already irked me in the trailer. You put all that work into such intricate animations and then the hands clip through one another all the time...
---
Why dont people look up what flouride and other shit they put to clean the water does to your body over time before you assume like a jack ass?
---
I agree, kormirs should be more expensive than ectos
---
tl;dr version; Predatory practices.
---
You can skip almost all the JPs with mounts and bond of faith.
---
thanks :)
---
!! thanks a lot  - ah yes i can do that
---
Ectos do need help though. They're a special case, since most of the open world rewards are completely based around them. Disregarding map-specific rewards, general play is usually rewarded with rares that you can salvage or sell for a bit of money. The price of rares is completely reliant on the price of Ectos, and thus how rewarding open world feels is reliant on it as well.
---
&gt; Why craft anything for your alt when you can just whip a dozen ascended boxes out of your bank and instantly gear them to cap.
---
You realize this is an extreme first-Tyria-problem, right? Most players are not flooded with ascended gear. Crafting is a baseline system that means that everyone has a path to the highest level gear, no matter what content you play. It's not supposed to be profitable or even favorable if you're able to do fractals and raids regularly, because otherwise what would be the point of fractal and raid rewards? Crafting is the bottom of the barrel, the well-worn path that everyone can follow, and it's fine like that, because it is inherently a skill-less activity and the only restriction on it is time. 
---
&gt;It's pretty clear that no one is attempting to steer the GW2 Economy in a direction that makes crafting, gathering, and farming, enjoyable and worth your time.
---
...should they be? I'm quite happy to get all the materials I could ever need from playing the game, literally anywhere. I hated when material prices were so high that I felt compelled to go on material scavenger hunts. As-is, if I see a node I'll grab it (especially platinum and iron) but I'm not going to go out of my way, and I'm cool with that.

You can drop the karma cost by a few different  methods.  The ones that combine resource gatherings are farming either HoT maps (1k karma + 25 map currency) [high xp gain for shards, champ bag rewards, karma cost reduction].  
---
Or in my opinion the vastly superior RIBA w/ chest in timeout.  You get xp, champ bags and straight up obby shards from the chests.  Plus the bandit crests can he used to purchase more obby shards (96c + 50 each) meaning karma can be removed from the cost equation completely.
---
Okay but *how*?
---
Ah my bad, I misread ya.
---
For us players who are too broke to afford a skyscale, I make do with the player camera, also my method is not as obvious as DRAGONS attached to a window.
---
yeah, the fact that they don't run all day means that people like me will never be able to do the event, since it literally starts when I'm at work, and seems to always have ended before I get home.
---
I feel like you want a very different game than I do.
---
I don't want an market simulator. I want an action RPG with a fast and easy TP, that lets me list stuff at fair market prices and get what I need at fair market prices, without having to worry about time or player interactions. 
---
I want to play the game, which to me means fighting monsters and getting loot, and then turn that loot into something else I want, either by selling it and buying it or salvaging and saving it. I want to be directed to specific content to play to acquire rare materials through events, not hunt for a rare node on the off chance I find what I need (or maybe just spend 15 minutes doing nothing).
---
HOT/POF mats have been useless since being added. You can't even vendor the POF ones ffs.
---
That's 100% not even fucking trying.
---
You can see different stars in the southern hemisphere.
---
Yeah... I never thought you have a high IQ, I'm sorry for you. Well, overestimating is a sign of naivety and arrogance, you should think about that. 
---
And that you come here, spray tantrum for now reason and now start insulting people out of the nowhere only shows that you aren't interested in any reasonable conversation. 
---
This is not Facebook, if you only want to show what a jerk you are, to it anywhere else. We don't want those people here.
---
I always hug my butter and onions for always being of value.
---
And the sky spins in the opposite direction.
---
&gt; Overestimating is a sign of naivety and arrogance...
---
You're right. I should have known you're an overconfident idiot from your very first response.
---
As someone who prefers to play the actual game rather than the AH or the crafting tables, I have zero problems with mats being cheap, and I love that over I time I naturally build up stores of mats by salvaging drops I get playing the game.  I hate running around gathering nodes, I just want to play the game, and salvaging enables that.
---
Everybody already got you info but i do want to add if it is sPvP you want to play then you do not have to unlock the elite spec inside of PvP lobby and ofc in a match. Everything is unlocked as if you were lvl 80 even if you are lvl 2. So if you own one or both expac then the elite specs that comes with that and the stats are also unlocked. 
---
That means that you could start playing reaper in sPvP as soon as you have the expansion. Do mind though, that the game is skilled based. You have to know how to counter and what to avoid and so on and at start it can feel like a truck hit you but that is just because you do not know yet. As soon as you learn what each class can do and what you can do to prevent it you will find it to be very fun because you can move whilst casting (even caster classes can) and dodge and so on so it is very fluent combat.
---
The southern area was supposed to be Nightmare Court focused. Those mordrem commanders that are up there gloating or whatever? Nightmare Courtier.
---
I'm trashy because I don't want bads crashing my raid squads? In fact I don't know too many people who want something like that. Not everyone wants to do a hand-hold training run, some of us like to play with other experienced players, and there is nothing wrong with that. So no, I'm not going to "delete my post"
---
It's not a balance thing, it's a direct correlation.
---
*This whole conversation:*
---
A person who watches TVs: "I'm glad TVs got so much more affordable over the last 50 years! Especially the older ones!"

Wanted to raid today and got lucky and spotted a wing 4 raid, they asked for dps but once I joined I swapped to chrono because they needed that more, chrono was a bit rusty but they where fine with that, Checked snowcrows for tips and tricks and traits for chrono wing 4 but alas API/skills where down, Next time I'm just gonna print screen and store it all down into a map just to be on the save side.....
---
No one is forcing you to do anything lmao. And after this pretty sure no one will want to join your "squad" anyway. And ofc you were perfect when you started raids, clearing them all first try. Not everyone who wants to learn is how you think they are - stop being so arrogant and narrow minded. Lead multiple training runs with varying success, some clearing bosses first or 2nd try and others taking many more tries. There gets to a point where actually helping other players progress themselves is actually fun imo.
---
And downvote me all you want, doesn't make you less of a dick.
---
Dungeons often need strategy. There are places where going without invisibility or other fancy tools as nearly impossible. Also, kiting enemies like in god old times, reflecting projectiles, avoiding certain attacks completely, focusing targets etc.
---
Fractals are like dungeons 2.0. They have 100lvls of difficulty, don't really need certain utilities BUT using them wisely make it much much faster to complete. They have higher gear requirements than dungeon but also better rewards. They can be done in any compositions but some are just much faster in killing stuff and skipping.
---
Raids. 10 man content that is full of heavy mechanics and roles (tank is present sometimes). Requires tailored compositions of certain classes, requires huge dps and efficiency (fights with timer) and a fair dose of teamwork. Here you just fight bosses or do small events in between.
---
Open world. Do as you like but always try to do some damage. Being a healer or raid tank won't help you unless you do it in party.
---
"pRen/hFB" is the composition I'm wondering about.
---
I might just build a pRen to try it out myself at some point...
---
Good place to ask: does anyone here have metabattle power renegade open world build?
---
hope this gets added in a living story
---
The rules are there to keep a civilized environment without assholes and their childish puberty "I-need-to-insult-people-to-feel-good" behavior. 
---
This subreddit has rules, accept and follow them or leave. One of the two will be the case anyway.
---
I know why it was necessary to use ecto for these stones, but damn if I don't wish they used globs of dark matter instead.

Light bends under gravity.  Using lasers, cut two very long metal bars horizontally then try and put the two upper faces together: you will get a small gap in the centre of the two, proving that the earth's surface is curved.
---
do you also pet them and tell them they have been good boys/girls?
---
Don't play with our feelings.
---
I would be a very bad owner if I didn't.  Especially if I intend to put them in the oven ;)
---
They were in the little corral area, across from Gorrik's lab screens.
---
Won't happen. Too much clipping issues since every single piece of armor and character model has not been made to incoorporate capes. I can imagine Anet having very different and interesting plans considering all the stuff they've been putting out past couple of months
---
I know more about this topic than you do...that much has been obvious from your initial response.
---
&gt; Gold can be earned from any way you enjoy the game
---
harvesting, crafting and farming can be fun or enjoyable. Just because you dont like those things doesnt make your preferred ways of playing better or worse than others.
---
Your initial answer only showed, that you know nothing and that your only reason to answer is to spray tantrum and insult people like kids in puberty do. 
---
I think they balance mid-season so that people can't just abuse the same build/comp all season. They've had that happen in the past, so I think this is their way of making sure things get shaken up mid-season. Or it's just coincidence that a balance patch is ready to ship at that time. Statistically, it's more likely to happen mid season since the breaks between seasons are shorter than the season itself.
---
I tend to consider today GW2 economy as a dead horse. No need to beat it more, it's over. The game has 7 years and had to few sinks for a lot of materials. Even by cutting by half lots of materials generation it's too late. Gen2 legs need 10k wood and mithril for instance. And the only thing that is doing is just barely keeping the price temporarily at an "ok" value. Now that all gen2 weapons are out, even those will drop to the ground within the end of the year (ie: 0.7s for mithril ingot and 3s for a plank of ancestral wood in 6 months without new sinks/leg weapons). So even with a 10k/10k sink per 1/1000 player it was almost not enough. If a new sink for others materials has to be created it would be something ridiculous like 100k per item. No one in his right mind could find that acceptable. Except for a guild hall feature. 
---
Guild hall were supposed to be the main sink for everything past HoT. But they were totally abandoned. Maybe metrics showed that too few people experienced building a full guild and/or it made a lot of small guilds being destroyed/despaired by those sinks. PoF didn't had an economist, hence unid gears and week 1 useless materials (kormir eyes and such, basically all PoF mats) because there was literally no sinks for them. 
---
They need to find something like guild hall sinks which would make "dumb mythological sinks" looks acceptable. As someone already said, the mystic forge event could be a way to handle that. But even then what could be the incentive for the player to destroy that much item? Not gold, no need for an inflation. Not another existing mat it will only displace the problem. I don't think a shiny as infusions is really healthy either because of variance and small size of batches. A 1 in 10k chance to have an infusion is only ok if doing 100k tries is accessible for everyone in term of sanity and wealth, which is not we all saw that with each festival and also with the new mf stone. People can only afford 1k or 2k before loosing their sanity and forgetting about sample size.
---
So what the only "ok" option? Maybe just by taking down material faucets. By nerfing every salvage. Heavily, like -80%. After that only a single festival of the four winds iteration will be enough. But a nerf of those proportions will alienate the player base.
---
Thus no option. It's a dead horse.
---
&gt; I want the best looking graphics.
---
Then don't use GW2Hook.
---
What about recipes that are a very minor upgrade to your character, be it something that gets added to gear or gear itself, but the recipes are random rare drops. Would that be a disaster?
---
It'll drain the bank account of the wealthy, give a small chance for someone to start acquiring wealth and regular players won't care because the upgrade is just too small.
---
In that world, people could spend their time getting the recipes to craft said items or spend that time making money or buying it themselves. There's the opportunity cost!
---
Yes...it is because I know "nothing" that I am one of the richest veterans in the game.
---
You got me figured out.
---
You win...with your overconfident stupidity.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Festival_of_the_Four_Winds_2018
---
Specifically you want to buy these from vendors: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zephyrite_Supply_Box
---
I probably have. If I can’t use it, I typically just sold it.
---
Let the win trading commence!
---
It could definitely use some extra polish. Good luck, and don't be afraid to ask questions!
---
There were very few instances where you could really wipe your group in dungeons. If you joined and sucked, you would just get carried. If you had 4 experienced players and 1 new player, the new player would get carried, and you could even have 4 new players getting carried by 1 experienced veteran. Raids, that's just not the case. Anyone in the group can pretty much wipe the run in different ways at almost every boss.
---
Since you mentioned getting into raids:
---
[Join the raid community discords.](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/)
---
Those communities have tons of information for new raiders, and experienced raiders that just want to help. Talk to people. Make connections, and get to know a commander or two.
---
Some general tips:
---
1) Show up prepared, ready to accept criticism, with a good attitude, and leave any shred of ego at the door. 
---
2) Even 10 minutes practicing your rotation at the golem and watching a video on the encounter is enough to give you an enormous advantage over someone that doesn't. 
---
3) A good commander would rather take a player that does the mechanics, uses their CC appropriately, and reacts to situations than someone that just greeds DPS any day - no matter how high their numbers are.
---
4) LI/KP are meaningless, most of us know it, and we still use the system anyway. It's not worth getting into fights over, and faking pings is a risky business that can and will bring out the worst in the people around you - instead, you can always whisper a commander in lfg and ask if they'll take you despite lacking the posted requirement. Sometimes they will, sometimes they won't. Accept their decision with grace.
---
5) The raid community is small, and it's likely you'll run into the same people regularly. You may gain a reputation. Refer to tip 1 and yours will be good, no matter how you perform.
---
6) Don't be afraid to block and avoid the occasional toxic asshole.
---
7) If you don't like lfg, join a guild or a static. It can be pretty nice to run with the same group of friends every week.
---
Hope that helps, and feel free to PM me if you ever have questions.
---
"Oh, a multi-million-dollar restaurant! Lemme just dump a handful of salt, pepper and glutamate into their food..."
---
&gt; I heard that there are new Mystic Forge skins coming with new Stones as an ingredient, I got excited....
---
Key word "new" ie not a pre-existing kind of stone.
---
&gt; it would still be better than just having them... there, sitting and taking up space.
---
I know you said you dont like gambling and you have a silver fed kit but just because you are ignoring/discounting the existing uses for them does not mean there has to be some kind of new sink for them. Either take advantage of their current uses or i dunno dont? continue on as normal? delete them? I understand your frustrations hopefully its something you can come to terms with and wont continue to bother you in the long run.
---
Would be nice if they dealt with blood magic necros and the soulbeast infestation
---
Anytime I see artstation connected to a GW2 post, I get excited :P
---
&gt; Yes...it is because I know "nothing" that I am one of the richest veterans in the game.
---
Nobody asked. Nobody cares.
---
But that you think this is something "special", something worth to brag with, only shows how mature an "intelligent" you are. ;)
---
&gt; You win...with your overconfident stupidity. I cannot compete with this level of stupidity. My IQ will start dropping to your level if I continue.
---
You should google what IQ stands for. I mean it's really cute that you think you use it right, but you call yourself the smartest ass in the house an *me* overconfident, which makes it hilarious and sad at the same time. But it's still cute. ;)
---
To quote a very intelligent and (ingame) rich person, who knows everything. 
---
&gt; It's generally a good idea to stay out of topics you are not familiar with.
---
I think you should take this to heart. Good night. ;)
---
Someone has grudge against filters...
---
That poor skyscale
---
No, just salty.
---
And on top of all the shit you listed off, they are fucking constantly bitching people who want to form experienced only groups. Calling them assholes, toxic, losers, whatever. It's seemingly impossible for them to even comprehend the idea of a group forming that doesn't exist solely to teach them how to play. Every group at all times, and every player at all times should be ready and willing to teach them if they feel like joining their group. Oh, you actually just wanted to relax and do a raid boss with a bunch of experienced players who know what they're doing? Toxic shithead! You're what's wrong with this game!!! This is why Anet needs to stop making raids at all!
---
Now every single one of your clones will fight against each other to claim that he is the real one.
---
I think it depends on how easy anet thinks the event is
---
It had its own share of issues though ;)
---
Bonus: guess which one is NOT a clone
---
This is so spot on. The shift to making so many crafted items a few years ago is to me simply unfathomable.  Its not just ascended items, its food and oils as well.
---
Enjoy the journey, now that I have it I'm struggling to find things to do lol
---
Decided on getting a full set of ascended armor, and now I'm broke lol
---
Easier for who? Maybe only for me. And if I uploaded my build people would find it more confusing than the meta battle one. But I get it we should all do as we're told to, no need to use brain and try new things / change things to be more comfortable. xD
---
Personally I have more than enough gold, bought it for the sake of convenience. And there are plenty of people who don't like to spend gems on gold - it's also taxed. Lol
---
https://youtu.be/XL4Br9JnnR0
---
My guild is coming to very similar conclusions Dan is making.  This video explains what we believe is going on in the top levels of the game right now which is also adversely affecting material prices for the money making machine
---
In your opinion, what will the impact be of the economy totally crashing and everything become worthless?
---
The real abominations are the Asuras.
---
Kessex hills wants to know your location
---
The disrespect...
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Prototype_Position_Rewinder
---
Thanks for your dumb input, now leave with the little honor you have left human. you wouldn't want another searing would you?
---
&gt;he vast majority of the raid group that failed so there was no chance the left pyre was going down
---
Yeah, it doesn't work for everyone &gt;&lt;
---
Can you use these to make the Mystic Salvage Kit? Because my first thought when they came in was how new-player friendly that would be. If you could use that to make Mystic, then new players wouldn't have to wait/hope that they got the regular stones.
---
 Yeah, it doesn't work for everyone &gt;&lt;
---
Cool, that's good to know where each episode sits. I assume you can do them at any time you want but it is best to do them in those time slots? How long are they on average?
---
Yeah, I've seen the one pyre method before but didn't know you put the portal on the platform to the right of Zommoros.  Thanks for the info! :D
---
I wonder if "Sic 'Em!" is being looked at... so many ppl raging about the burst on sbeast. Besides, this is an old skill from the land before time... 40% dmg modifier? I don't think any other skill/trait surpasses 20% these days. I'm trying to look at this from a logical pov (a lot of dmg modifiers that synergise already with sbeast), I don't want just band aid fixes either.
---
I feel like scrapper overperforms. Let's see what gets changed this time around...
---
While it may be over-tuned, I would wager a good deal of people used the free sky-scale treat on that requirement to skip it, remember that is always an option.
---
that useless bullshit can go hide in a corner, unless they reduce that moronic CD by 95% it's worthless.
---
Alrighty, I signed up!
---
a glitch in the matrix
---
Rata Novus in HoT, Rata Primus in LS4.  They get little tag on's for story that so far has been "they have/had other cities!" but little else for Asura lore.  I want to see more LORE of the Asura, add their political element and how some leaders seem to have very close ties to enemy factions.  
---
Charr and Norn have been so neglected that each deserves their own LS season, and expansion, and a follow up LS season to explore what their lore is.  Charr have more flushed out, since they have the history of GW1 to back things up (probably meaning they're harder to work into new story because of continuity), and Norn have a bare minimum amount of lore allowing for LOTS of story telling to go on (perhaps some LS about how their desire to be written into ballads?)
---
Pfft, Aurene never even slept in the bed we made for her.
---
Chrono is still the meta in raids, the class has gotten significantly easier as well (no more swapping weapons for extra boon duration) and with the release of diviners it gives more room for chronos to provide better boons and damage. Imo till you have a great grasp of chronomancer again run the 100% boon duration build (pretty much full diviners) to give yourself room for error.
---
Didnt you read? They need to fix it by fixing it!
---
This was me doing the Blazeridge collection step, hitting the mark and falling off the other side of the spot.
---
Maybe I was the clone all along?
---
I would second this, but add the caveat that you should take care not to be tank for new encounters or fights you are rusty on. Practice as off tank or in fractals and know your golem rotation well.
---
Apologies, I'm not seeing the connection between any of the banner collections and the Vabbi Leyline Anomaly, could you elaborate on what you mean?
---
Are they stuck or something?  Surprised they're not swarming you.
---
I think you're selling gathering and crafting a little short.  I don't want to farm for gold.  I want to play the video game, and gathering and then crafting things for myself are things I enjoy doing in this video game.
---
&gt;It should feel rewarding to go out of your way to find rare mats or save money by gathering resources for your own personal use
---
It does feel rewarding to do that.  Off-hand, materials worth stopping for are: every metal but copper, every wood but green, both truffles, flax, herb sprouts, peppers, a couple of the berries I think?  I stop for almost everything; all the basic materials can be converted into time gated ascended mats that are consistently valuable.  I've spent years stockpiling those mats, and now if I need some quick cash I just sell a few, or if I feel like making X character Y piece of ascended gear I just do that no worries.  My account isn't flooded with ascended boxes; maybe we're doing different content.
---
Also I've found those account-bound materials incredibly useful.  I have the home instance nodes and it lets me stockpile stacks of the things that can be turned into ascended trinkets or UM/VM whenever I need.  Between those and crafting I've handled all my ascended gear mostly without boxes and it's overall been a very rewarding process that continues to be useful to me.
---
I feel like we're just playing the game differently.  I try to pretend that farming for gold doesn't exist.
---
