This is what is occuring, yes.

In their defense...our community isn't that easy to talk to.
---
You'll notice that none of the open world build are actually tagged as meta (except for minion master, which might be a joke). You can't realistically define an open world meta because you cannot be sure of how each encounter would go.
---
Improv is only @ Qadim. Exec is far better on Samarog, CA, etc   
---
Reason for Improv is because Exec is simply bad on champs due to almost no uptime (they get nuked after 80-75%) and double Bombs speeds them up by a lot as well as Plasmas carrying boons while keeping nearly same boss dps.   
---
Wanted to make it more clear to avoid confusion.

Holy crap that's cool. Forget a virus strain or a new flower named after me. In this age, a file format named after you is pretty neato
---
There's definitely a lot of competition, but raids aren't very difficult, and releases are irregular, meaning there aren't a lot of world-first races. Usually, it's tournaments, low-man kills and speed-runs. 
---
no gw2 has no hard content and all has next to no competition
---
It's hard because of fellow players, not because of the bosses.
---
Well, it's stickied so it doesn't even matter. 
---
You're just going around in a circle and doubling down on your assertion. I don't think you listened to what I said.
---

---
Shit is happening right now. We don't know what exactly is going on. You assume those who should be showing the product have the control to do so, which at the moment, may be assuming a LOT.
---
And it doesn't do much good right now to speak abstractly about them and what they can do. "The company"? Who at the company are you expecting to step in for this one thing right now? It still has to come down to someone, and I'm willing to bet, as much as it sucks, that designating who is going to be showing off their newest feature isn't high on the priority list when the whole organization has to suddenly restructure itself and people are still figuring out whether they have to pack up their desks.
---
The whole thing looks to be a mess. More updates from leadership would help (I don't disagree there!), but acting sour because of this event that just got dropped in the mess isn't helping, and neither is presuming that you know enough about what's going on to tell the people affected what they should be able to do right now. That would require you actually be involved within their workplace, and not just as a player. 
---
The Level 10/20/30 stories are all based on what you chose at character selection, and are all their own instances. The racial story will never come back outside of that, barring some small references.
---
Only after you pick an Order to permanently join does the story take into account your choices and branch off, and reference your previous choices.
---
And with a reduced staff, you'd better get used to this bug lol
---
Guilds have always been a part of WvW. Not sure what you mean exactly by fixed groups. Also as far as I know sPvP can only get max 10 man teams in custom arena. GvGs are done between guilds that are somewhere between 15-25 each. And I don’t think the PvP balance would support that kind of content very well.
---
What about the shoulders piece? :o
---
" I am well aware that mirage dominates the lower tier divisions, but it is only a " Learn to play" or "git gud" problem, where an experienced player can outplay and shut down his output quite effectively"  you were literaly running like pussy and played all holo OP trash sustain cards + juking. i guess you had some issues with duel too. you woudnt last  20 sec on point.
---
You can thank Chronos for that lowered cap, because it used to be 9 instead of 5, until they started to break WvW with zerg-wide permanent Prot+Stab+Resist+Might+Quickness.
---
Ironically the worst offender, Signet of Inspiration, doesn't even work the same way anymore...
---
Then again... we also have FBs nowadays... so the cycle continues...
---
I'm probably bias, but consider giving Necro a try.  Base necro with minions makes leveling pretty easy and power Reaper hits like a truck with just a few skills in open world.  Also, Scourge is overtuned atm in WvW (subject to change with the balance patch Tuesday) and I've had the best luck in PvP on some kind of necro.  They aren't top tier in Raids or T4's, but they're by far my favorite for solo content, open world, and WvW.  
---
Guardian is also a solid choice for a lot of game modes.  Might want to check then out.  Power Dragonhunter was my instanced PvE main for over 2 years, and rotations aren't too difficult.
---
There's one point to be made in that gw2 raiding is requires incredibly low commitment compared to most other mmos (with a 80-boost you can be up and running with 90th percentile gear in a few hours), so for that reason I'd suggest giving it a try.
---
As others have said, the world first races aren't the epic week long contests we see in wow, as no boss has stood for more than a day. So instead people focus on speed clears, low mans, meme comps etc.
---
As someone tat plays both games ( raiding top100 in wow currently), the simple answer is no. Raiding in GW2 is msotly comparable to what Heroic difficulty in WoW is. There's challenge, but it's pretty quickly overcome by good players. Nothing comparable to end game Mythic progression. 
---

💜💜💜
---
amazing... So, better sell that shit! Thanks 
---
The hardest part about GW2 raids is, that bosses are so easy that people never need to refine their play. 
---
So no. I never played an MMOs which bosses are as easy as in GW2. Even Destiny 2 Raids ask for more commitment from each individual player.
---
If you just start out raiding the bosses are all worth a look and some are actually fun if you play a role that has to do more than stand still and press your rotation.
---
Don't get fooled by people that tell you the bosses are all "mechanic heavy". No one who ever played a bother MMOs Raids above story mode would talk that way.
---
Interpretation for those who don't want to stare:
---
* Top: Blast finisher in fire field for might (hammer symbol for blast and 5 might boon symbols signifying 5 stacks of might)
---
* Left: Projectile finisher (arrow from a bow) causes projectile to become flaming bolt
---
* Bottom: Leap finisher (person jumping) gives a fire shield around your body.
---
* Right: Whirl finisher (person spinning?)  throws out fire bolts in random directions/at enemies.
---

Which makes me wonder. Have we ever seen skritt corrupted by ED?

World firsts are not taken seriously by ANET. The first wing to release in 2015 had it's world first kill claimed by a guild that play tested before the expansion/raid wing were ever publicly available. The last wing that was released (Last Sept.) there was a bug with activating the challenge mote for the final boss. A single GW2 streamer and his guild were given a heads up from an ANET dev that the mote would be disabled. This left the entire game outside of this group of 10 allowed to attempt the world first CM kill of Qadim (final boss), and they did indeed get the kill. 
---
All competition is player made and player ran with the biggest competitions (wing clear times) being ran by the streamer mentioned above. (The competitions are well done &amp; entertaining I'm not bashing the streamer)
---
Multiple bosses can and have been killed with 3-4 players (raids support 10 man) and arguably the hardest boss in game (Dhuum CM) can be low manned and is low manned often for raid sells.
---
Hope that helps. 
---
I would like to the Norn pull a Norn and use their transformations.
---
Nope, we didn't. The Skritt Masterrace can't be corrupted by lowly elder Dragons.
---
The problem that I see with this logic is that I would think that ArenaNet would have tried to spin the bad PR as 'hey, now we will be more focused on GW2 than ever', but that hasn't really been the case. If MO was honest and said something like, we spread ourselves too thin, but now our only focus is GW2 and our entire team is dedicated to that game and pushing out expansions, then I'd feel much better.
---
The sad thing is even if that is the case, the communication from ANet is so bad that we'd probably never hear it and it'd hurt the game even more.

As someone who did hardcore raiding in WoW before GW2 came out, I think the difficulty is comparable. Now, obviously a lot of people here seem to disagree with that so I'm guessing the difficulty of raids have been increased since then. However, I wouldn't say it's nearly as easy-mode as some people claim here. A lot of the CM's are nothing to scoff at.  
---
Even if it's true that the raids aren't as difficult as WoW raids are now, I wouldn't write them off right away. You mentioned 'fun' and I think the GW2 style of raids is a breath of fresh air. The play style is very different from the more traditional WoW setup. The type of challenge is just very different. As someone who raids a lot you might just enjoy the change of pace.   
---
I also think there's some truth in saying that, just because you're good in WoW raids, doesn't necessarily make you good in GW2 raids, being good in dynamic combat requires a different set of skills than WoW combat. I would say, you just have to give it a go yourself and decide what you think of it. I don't think anyone here could really tell you whether you'd enjoy it or not.   
---
You can play the base game for free so you can get a feel for the combat style, just know that the leveling process is pretty easy and open world stuff doesn't really become more challenging until the expansions and the raids are vastly more difficult than open world all [together](https://together.So) but it will give you a decent sense of how combat feels to see if you would even enjoy that kind of gameplay. You'll also find that leveling is not very linear aside from the story (open world is basically a sandbox), that puts people who come from more structured MMOs off sometimes.  
---
If you do decide to give the base game a whirl, feel free to PM me and I'd be happy to give you the run down or answer questions.
---

Still, hate running into them.
---
Please keep in mind that people criticizing this aren't necessarily criticizing the random working-folks who are concerned about their jobs. The fact of the matter is, *someone* in the company -- probably much higher-up and absolutely secure -- knew damned well that this was supposed to go down, knew damned well that there's a lot of uncertainty and confusion in the playerbase right now that needs to be addressed, *and* knew about these lay-offs long before the average employee did. 
---
*Someone* is responsible for both disappointing the community, *and* leaving a lot of perfectly-decent ANet employees on the hook for this -- and there's nothing cruel or wrong or entitled about wanting to hold that person responsible for that. It's possible to be upset on behalf of ANet, too, and it's unfortunate that you seem just as quick to jump to conclusions and reactions as the people that you were criticizing.
---
I've been on the other side of this, too -- learning that my job might not be secure and still having to go through the motions -- and I have nothing but sympathy for the workers and nothing but disgust for whatever upper management left those employees to deal with the fallout of this.
---
GW2 raids are fun, but are nowhere near the level of WoW raids as far as difficulty. The raiding scene is nothing remotely like the race to World First in WoW. I mean WoW had 100-180k people on Twitch watching that. GW2 is lucky to get even a few thousand for any "big event." There are some well known raiding guilds that do theory crafting and speed clears, but that's about it. 
---
I think FF14 is more similar to WoW than GW2 or ESO. GW2 is just a more casual game. It's fun and maybe you want to try it when you have downtime in WoW. That's what I do. 
---
Definitely agree. I prefer to play the character from level 1 and do stories to gell with the toon. Helps me with not deleting them !
---
Two builds jump to mind, there's a pretty stupid tanky scrapper build out there, and there's the aegis firebrand with valor/honor trees. 
---
Because greatsword has mobility and you don't need max dps in open world.
---
Don't get into hardcore endgame raiding. You will be miserable and unhappy. Waiting 9 fucking months for single raid wing with 2-3 bosses is just not worth it. The difficulty compared to mythic raiding in WoW is just laughable. And Anet's doesn't give a shit about raiding community racing to be world first. Don't do this to yourself.
---
This is a great writeup. It takes all of the recent and reliably sourced information, as well as past information, and connects it together to make a very well-built and cohesive argument about what went on behind the scenes, and simultaneously acknowledges the speculative nature of any arguments that are formed from information given. If I were to make any suggestions, it would be more sources, especially on the past information (i.e. HoT being a "small expansion", announcements of the restructuring, etc.). Regardless, this was very informative and did a good job at staying neutral on a potentially touchy subject. Take my upvote, it helped me get a better grasp on the situation and showed me new viewpoints.
---
F96 and f42 farms are around that mark with a perfect comp and an experienced party. 
---
you probably just haven't unlocked the other attunements yet, you'll unlock them as you level (can't remember exactly what level since it's been a long time since that for me). once it's unlocked you'll switch attunements using function keys (f1 is fire, f2 is water, f3 is air, f4 is earth)

Always remember Southsun Cove!

I've been so busy with work that I've not played in a while. But if you're looking for a guild that's awesome Knights of the silver chalice is amazing! We do have a rep requirement but we play all aspects of the game and I hear there's a crew doing gw1 stuff
---
Why is Dhuum CM considered the hardest boss? I've never done it myself, just normal Dhuum (It feels easier than Xera) I watched people doing it in CM and the only mechanic that i see being added is the little Dhuum running around, all you have to do is step aside, no?
---
So, legendary armor was only supposed to be good stuff for a single, small group of players?  
---
I never said the cat doesnt mean its not happening, but, why is it 15 months later without it being done? Thats pretty silly.
---
Sure, they took mounts out of loot boxes (i dont think they took the original ones out, which would still be an issue, every day) but they put other things locked behind paywalled (basically) lootboxes.
---
Wait, what? Norn can transform?
---
I trained at the golem for a whole 20 minutes before i got the BS and DH rotations. Never returned there again, i do about 90% of the SC damage, more than enough to beat any encounter. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
All this to say that i agree with your point.
---
And stepping aside interrupts and weakens many dps rotations, which rely on melee attacks, lowering the amount of overall damage your team does.
---
Add that to the fact that the little guy ricochets back into the group fairly frequently; camera angles where the tank is normally facing the other way from the group meaning either party may not see him coming; three green circle runners that have to be mobile to do their mechanics -and- avoid him (and lord forbid you come back down on top of the little guy after collecting the balls on a short timer), and the messenger kiter who is also smack in the middle of many moving mobs...
---
...chances are pretty high that 1 out of 10 players may not react in time to the little guy.
---
And if too much time is wasted freeing people, there goes your dps and potential kill, so /gg. Oh, you /gg'ed? Repeat the trash sequence. Again.
---
its only 10g if you are the only one doing dailies

5-10min of “work”for 10g, you are quite the greedy moron arent you.

So "S" Dragon was Sano all along? Top 10 anime plot twists.
---
Other than Population balance and better wvw class balance, it would have to be less skill lag, in large scale fights at least.
---
in short? the game has to be programmed for it.
---
the GW2 engine has to be rewritten in order to fully utilize the GPU and multi-core CPU. as far as i know, the only company that manage to do it is war-gaming with their [CORE engine](https://youtu.be/Lt7omxRRuoI).
---
One thing a lot of people don't seem to understand. If the reports are to correct the ones being let go are the ones working on *other* projects, not GW2. While this isn't a insane blow you still have to accept the team we have is smaller than we're used to. 
---
Even the article doesn't say where the 33% number comes from, just that "While no official number has been announced by the studio, it is believed as much as 33% of the company could be let go – about 132 employees." 
---
In current ridiculous balance of PvP, protection Holosmith and boon soulbeast are the two that can sustain very well and output a load of damage altogether. Check the build on metabattle. Hope anet would address these ridiculous build next patch tho.
---
Based on the wording and lack of even an implied source I wouldn't put much trust in that figure.  We just need to be patient and wait for final numbers.
---
That said, I do agree with your main point:  a 270-person studio should be enough to keep GW2 growing.
---
Once you use bond of faith, while glitched under the map, you get stuck there forever. (Unless you WP out)
---
That's probably it. In the past when my bow had no infusions I must have checked AR only when I was wielding my main weapon. Now that the bow is equipped the AR appears to be unchanged, when it in fact has improved when I am using the bow.
---
Thanks!
---
See above .. that was probably it. And now that the main and alt weapons have the same AR it seems like the agony is unchanging. Thanks!
---
How does the Sirens Landing meta work? I see shrines that need to be powered and then defended? How do they all connect and what’s the purpose/reward for defending them all after they’re powered?
---
Does anybody know of any particular devs who seem to have been layed off?
---
All I could find that was notable was it seems Matthew Medina, based on his twitter, got layed off. That's pretty depressing considering how long he's been there and how much work he put into GW2, but he seemed to have been moved to work on that other project primarily. 
---
2600K is the issue, its old and behind in modern computing for tasks such as GW2. You are looking at a new build to 'fix' the issue. I would suggest Nvidia for the GPU since the driver will split the DX9c load into two threads for a more balanced FPS. As for a CPU anything current Intel/AMD would work fine. 
---
&gt;20 wins in 10 days
---
&gt;more than 3 matches is too much for my fragile PvE player body.
---
Are you me? That was exactly my situation last time too lol. For me the toughest part of the achievement was getting 6 wins in a day, because that meant at least 6 matches in 24 hours. After that it was the 3 classes wins. I'm fine on Guard and Ranger but holy hell the salt I received on my mesmer (because I sucked). So glad to be done with the mesmer wins.
---
Which 3 classes did you choose?
---
This.  It's more of a pain and takes a bit longer, but with enough proof that it's yours they can usually recover it.
---
They never mentioned switching from Expansions to soley Living World; just that there would be a season 5 between season 4 and the next expansion.  A longer wait between expansion, but they never mentioned cutting them entirely.
---
The only boons you give are might and some regen, there isn't a reason to run high duration when you could be getting more damage and barrier.
---
Don't really need it. The primary boon Scourge gives out is Might and you provide it through a ton of skills.
---
You do get a little bit (15%) boon duration from having shades up.
---
Unfortunately, my raiding experience is limited in wow and gw2. However from the few fights I've seen in GW2, I can say they seem much simpler than Savage raiding in FFXIV. My understanding is Savage raiding is comparable to mythic raiding in wow.  That said, the fights are challenging, so don't think it will be a cake walk.
---
Where is your proof that they will no longer make expansions? Them going from living world season 4 to 5 is not proof. It COULD quite well mean that they are going to take longer to develop the next xpac. Only time will tell.
---
Like what? 200 days for single fractal or 3 months for 2 hours of sinlge player story experience?  " i come from WoW and was mainly raiding there in a top guild. " He said. He wants to raid not roleplay. If you enjoy other SLOWER pace things that's great, THAT'S AMAZING - and GW2 is incredible choice for that. It's just not what he is looking for. 
---
Not at all. The only one lost is anyone who thinks that understanding basic concepts that apply to all development studios equates to being a shill.
---
Finally. Thank you.
---
For WvW I would say Deadeye, Soulbeast, Mirage, Sourge or Firebrand. I'm pretty sure those are the good jobs at the moment. Those are the ones I have trouble against and wish I picked.
---
I like instanced content.  What I don't like about raiding is the organization headache of trying to get large numbers of people together on the internet on a regular schedule and the masochistic aspects of content built around difficulty purely for difficulty's sake.
---
Because it's their job
---
Um, op should take about half of this advice if not less
---
i love GW2 and thank Anet for all the things they have been able to do with it but am i the only one that feels if it really has been 200-300 people working on GW2 alone what have they actually been doing? 
---
perhaps a true reshuffle is needed as it does kinda sound like there is some real mismanagement in the offices and to me a developer of that many employee's doing more than they currently are. 
---
its over double the size of studio's like Grinding Gear Games who do insane work releasing what would be expansions every 13 weeks. i know its not quite the same but i do feel when you look at much smaller studio's and what they are able to produce with smaller teams and in shorter time periods i do wonder where all the man power is being put to work. this isnt a slight on any of the development team or people who work there its more just a case of wondering if they really do many the most of the talent that works for Anet.
---
Interesting, I use Guard Ranger and Mesmer aswell (In the form of Fbd, Slb and Mirage of course). Got a good duo Scourge for my Fbd, but other than that I'm all alone and open to all toxicity pouring down from my teammates.
---
Losing rank or matches doesn't bother me much. I just can't stand that if I make one single mistake that costs me an easy lose, and I have to work so much for every match because very rarely get "free wins". TL;DR every match is cancer and I can get no relief unless I play during the day which is imppossible in my case (I'm an EU player living in NA)
---
You know what really get down voted in  this reddit? Non political correct comment and i am gonna do one. In real life, no company will get away with this last minute or should I say, late cancellation of a scheduled event. Sure, you or anyone might think is a live stream thus no big deal but that isn't the problem here, the problem is that kind of thinking.
---
There might be people who stay up late, just to grasp a first hand peak on what it is about, even if they have work the next day. There might be people who took leave off work just to get that first hand peak too. There might be people who sneak out of their workplace just for a bit to get a sneak peak. There might be a lot of different people doing different things for different reasons just to be there for there for that stream.
---
One group can argue courtesy (that is different from respect, please), another group can argue professionalism.
---
What I can tell you is everyone in the world has their own problems to deal with, no exception, it is part of the responsibility as a adult, as a member of the society. How you deal with the problems speak about one's maturity. As a company, this definitely not acceptable, definitely should have been better.
---
Rich for me. I hardly ever have any gold
---
&gt; I would like some insight to why they think moving from expansions every 1-2 years to just LS episodes was a good idea.
---
When keep the point in mind that the whole post-PoF Palawa Joko plot come between the original plans and took 3 of 6 (probably 6) episodes, whoch is 50%, than it makes sense that they need another season to deliver the original story. 
---
Also it was never said that they switch to LS only. It was said that LS5 comes after 4, that's it. Nothing about "no more expansions", nothing about "Only LS in the future".
---
The DPS with the highest casts per minute reach &gt;40 CPM in end-game content. It's still slower than some MMOs, but not glacially slow like the low levels would imply it to be.
---
In my group's fastest kill of the easiest raid encounter this tier, I had 32.4 casts per minute as a healer and the 4 DPS had 43.5, 42.2, 34.8, and 34.7.
---
Remember that the early levels have to be doable for people who are FF players first and MMO players second.
---
Can we stop with these threads?  GW2 and GW1 teams are NOT being affected by the lay-offs.
---
"We can confirm that due to the cancellation of unannounced projects, ArenaNet will make staff reductions," the statement reads. "This is part of a larger organizational restructuring within NCSOFT in the west, but the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is any upcoming game content canceled."

---
Can people just play the fucking game? I swear some of you spend half the day "researching" gossip and coming up with theories. Some of you have way too much time on your hands. 
---
If I usually cant find anyone, I just kill supply dolyaks and small camps until someone stops me. Eventually a commander tag will pop up on the map to follow
---
that's asking alot. 2 years is enough time for players to check out all aspects of the game. But problem is GW2 xpacs aren't that big. Think core game pre HoT. That's what you expect with an Xpac. HoT was such a small release and even PoF other then mounts felt extremely small. One and done maps. 4 core maps?really...
---
Next xpac they need to be massive with content. It feels like they hold content back for living world episodes when doing xpacs. It should be the opposite. Give us the full frontal of content and then add more later. Don't hold back.
---
We have the game finished, we need badly new content, an espansion or LWS5 episodes with espansion like content. Last days we found out that Anet has nothing for us but a few classic LW episodes meaning 2-4 hours of new content every 3 months. Even if Anet shift their focus towards GW2, it will be 6 months or more until we get new content created. So you see we have nothing to do but talk about this situation.

Where in here does it say “without governments and universities?”
---
Governments and universities **in capitalist countries** are able to spend lots of tax money on valuable things other than keeping people alive **because of all the profits to tax.**
---
There was no game updates in the last few days, so it's something that suddenly changed on your end.
---
I realize fractals are the new hard mode dungeon, but they need to look at adding new dungeons with LW episodes or several at once with Xpacs.

I can't comment on the Chinese market , because I am not from there. But these ideas sound terrible , I fully would not want them if it were me, and if I had to deal with the practices that you apparently do , I probably just wouldn't play.  Charging by the minute , on top of charging for expansions and having a cash shop ? That sounds like a nightmare , and you are suggesting it's great and should be done more ? LOL insanity. 
---
The community manager is on vacation since before this happened i think. They have much more to deal with before speaking to players. Restructuring an entire company is going to get in the way for now, and that is fine. It's a mega task.

---
I mean I wouldn’t say they were ugly, but they are pretty basic and lack a wow factor.
---
well there is a tutorial NPC at the spawn
---
I think an LFR(looking for Raid) much like the LFG system could work here. Either an intro to raiding for some or the ability to find lots of people at any given time without need for salt. Reduced rewards of course for the less difficult content but teaches people some of the mechanics of raids.
---
Billing by the minute...
---
Yeah keep that bullshit in Chinese markets. 
---
Obvious troll is obvious.
---
Why ? Recognized by who ? Can you give an actual reason ? 
---
The only thing id be ok with is if they would do like $10-20 for a living story pack but you get all chapters right there and treat them as a mini expansion pack every 6 months or so. I think thats the biggest thing is they dont have actual content they charge for and a big box expansion isnt anytime soon.

Blizzard has begun to learn how to increase revenues from Netease, and if ANET does not make any changes, the next news on the ANET in China's game forum will be: "ANET collapses due to financial difficulties"

If you want competitive or challenging endgame PvE content, then go with ESO. Anet wants to keep gw2 as casual as possible, including raids. And while the raiding in gw2 sure is fun, the raids look absolutely stunning and mechanics are quite interesting... the difficulty level just isnt there.
---
You can still buy gw2 PoF when its on sale, and just play it a few hours here and there. Boost a holo to lvl80 and join some w6 raids without LI requirements to take a look at raids, and if you like it, get HoT later on. Tbh, gw2 is the only mmorpg I know off that you dont have to spend hours upon hours just preparing for endcontent and then to keep at top level. That makes it absolutely perfect to be enjoyed on the side.
---
Yeah, he was allegedly even one of the best. Wish the story could've shown this better.
---
Dunno, would prefer you get "Data Skritt" or something like that. 
---
I mean.... theyre not the ugliest ive ever seen but I certainly couldnt be bothered to grind for them. 
---
This is the experience of the Chinese market, WOW (the most prosperous period), the swordsman love OL（JX3OL), these are the games that have been in the Chinese market for more than 8 years, the FF14 and WOW Taiwan regional servers are all charged by the minute.
---
JX3OL's revenue last year was about 2.8 billion RMB, about three times the global revenue of GW2.
---
Must be a Warrior hammer to be getting might off blast finishers ;P
---
I agree!
---
They never said that, they just said that GW2.... The product..... Won't be affected.
---
Also, as mentioned by the OP, there are not Dev/Art/Writer jobs so ANet as well. With publishing moving back to NCSoft (where it was during the GW1 and GW2 launch), any staff tied to publishing will probably go.
---
GW2 has plenty of replayability across the entire game. As a six year vet i'm still around and I participate in all game modes. They focus alot on group content and i there's a place for some solo endgame content that doesn't seem to be bothered with much.
---
AGAIN you DID  NOT  give a reason why it is "most conscientious" or "the most reliable way to guarantee quality". You JUST REPEATED how much profit they made. 
---
I can’t tell if trolling or legitimately inept. Oh well lol time to do fracs, for free 😂
---
Grats
---
You clearly misunderstand the market in the U.S. GW2 is a game casual players can play. I spend quite a bit in gems but what you've outlined will get me to quit faster than anything I can imagine. Chinese and American markets are different. I'm not interested in the least in Chinese style gaming
---
If we really believe all those reports that ArenaNet was juggling multiple projects at the same time and moved more and more personal to those projects, let us assume this is the case.
---
This would mean, with the cancellation of those projects all those devs would probably get back to GW2, even if the 33% were to let go then we could still see a lot of devs coming back to the game which could mean that there would be more devs available to work on it.
---
Which also means that with a larger number of devs working on the game more game modes could actually get content releases (guilds, QoL etc) and things that got neglected for a long time could then see a breeze of fresh air (I'm not talking about dungeons).
---
However, it is still too early to say anything about that or how the whole thing develops because we have no insight into what is going on there.
---
I wonder how much I'd have to pay to do my dailies ? LOLZ
---
pretty much i like the free content, but yes if Anet needs more money this is one way to do it.
---
I play Core Guard, Druid and Mirage. Interesting enough I main Condi Chrono in WvW and pretty good at it, but I'm terrible as Mirage. 
---
My first PvP toon was an FB too but stopped after my Scourge duo took a break from the game. I then switched to Spellbreaker, but my high latency made it hard to land hits once I was in Gold. Hence the switch to mesmer.
---
I care about wins only for achieves or dailies. I'm pretty confident as guard and have like 80% win rate on the class. My druid is probably around 60%. I'd say my mesmer is about 33% XD
---
When I play guard, I feel I can make a difference to influence the outcome of the match. I can deal with all classes pretty effectively, unless the enemies are much higher ranked than me. I love playing core guard in pvp so much that I made one dedicated guard for PvP and WvW  xD
---
ANET funds are tightly laid off, and it has nothing to do with our Chinese server. Our Chinese server is very good, and every player is actively reloading.
---
As an overnight player I often find it hard to find maps that actually have people doing things. Are there any specific maps in the PoF expansion that are popular during these late hours so I can grind exp for my masteries?
---
Sorry about the compression 
---
Gratz :)
---
GZ!
---
I only know that ANET is laying off employees. Maybe it will be closed in a year. LOLZ
---
The players in such a developed country in the United States are still crying poorly, really shameful.
---
I agree that you know only one thing. By your admission in this comment , you are ignorant. You ONLY know that one thing.
---
Don't you feel an urge to sit on it?
---
Congrats 
---
I don't see how the situation is much different for competing MMOs. With ESO, we know what's coming this year, but not what's coming next year. With GW2 we know there will be a Season 5 this year, including the raid and fractal updates, maybe the WvW restructure, but we don't know anything else.
---
The ironic thing is, it's possible GW2 will benefit from the restructuring, but the speculation is all about the sky falling down.
---
I feel like that, honestly. 
---
I've played since launch, not left the game for a single week, played ALL days, only spent money for the expansions and maybe a couple of gem cards.
---
I know that this may sound "bad" for a company whos point is making money from their customers, but if they ever change their policies to what this china user said, I'm out.
---
The most attractive think that I've always loved from this game is that the gemstore IS NOT only for the "credit card guys", everyone can get their stuff if they work hard for, with gold exchange.
---
Anet laid-off people because the side-project (apparently not directly related to gw2) were dead-ends, so it kinda has nothing to do with profit.
---
I was referring to
---
&gt;Gem store system completely destroyed the reward system of PVE
---
Because iirc you can get a loooot of stuff from Gems in China that we cannot in NA/EU (like legendaries and +20 stat infusions to name a few) which I think is very crappy.
---
And about business model everything that works in Country/Market A won't necessarily work or be accepted in Country/Market B. See the backslash that happened when Anet introduced to RNG adoption mount licenses, see the way Belgium has applied a ban on anything that can be considered as a RNG lootbox bought with real money (this applies to Black Lion Keys and RNG Mount License for GW2).
---
Tbf by-the-minute billing is a very predatory concept that could lead Anet to introduce very shitty mechanisms in the game which could ultimately drive away a non-negligeable part of the NA/EU community.
---
It's a Dervish in GW farming... kinda....
---
Ok I partially understand. But since GW1/GW2 teams dont seem to be affected, why do they cancel their stream?
---
Now do Path of Fire.
---
But seriously, this is magnificent. Really striking, especially the way it's lit. Bravo.
---
What do you want from him though? He is not a market analyzer; the fact that he recognized one business model is more popular than the others should be enough point of discussion.
---
Yeah, but lights wouldn't give it the effect I want. I'm gonna paint it at some point, [in the style of the OG logo](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1920&amp;bih=888&amp;q=guild+wars+2+heart+of+thorns+logo&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiU4qaA69PgAhWphOAKHf5WCv8QsAR6BAgDEAE#imgrc=vSv-Db7qe6aHaM:), except there is another version of that logo out there that has a more papery feel to the background. I can't find it though...
---
PoF is on my to-do list, but atm more pressing projects will take over the work bench! I''m really glad with how it turned out, and I'm looking forward to what my future project will look now that I'm walking away from this one with the experience I have.
---
I actually did the wins one last because I was super confident on my Guard. Plus being on lower rank makes getting wins for my Mirage easier xD
---
Before landing on core guard I was looking for a class that could deal with pesky thieves and deadeyes (I sucked at thieves so that was a no go). Druid could do it to an extent, but core guard is even more effective. As a bonus, core guard is a natural counter to Mirages. It's really satisfying to see them turn tail and run everytime when they realise they couldn't win the 1v1. 
---
I know I'm dealing with higher ranked players when classes that are supposedly weak against guards eg. thief engaged me without hesitation. Even though I couldn't kill them, they couldn't kill me either as I hold the point. Then they'd waste no time and rotate elsewhere. 
---
I'm on NA. Currently taking a break from PvP to pursue PvE goals. Didn't even finish my placement matches, but the few that I did, my team won every match xD
---
But have you played FFXIV?  There are so many spells/skills in that game.  I think they could definitely make it work, just, you know, not as efficient as mouse &amp; keyboard of course.
---
Announcing they weren't working on an expansion would be a really poor PR move, and they could expect to lose a substantial number or players and sales if players thought the game was losing substantial support like that.
---
The lack of any announcement is the most we were ever going to get.
---
[Not this flat one?](https://i.imgur.com/8AHzZUP.png) I don't think there are any other versions.
---
That would be pretty cool! There is also no reason why steam had to cap me out lol. If they went full ham sandwich I could have got everything mapped lol. 
---
billing by the minute could be ok if you would spend much less money as in a monthly sub
---
Finally! Nice work Tell :D
---
While that is true, I don't think that the combat is comparable to GW2. FF on a controller is mostly swapping between panels 
---
Gratz. I once got the hammer precursor a log time ago. Nothing since...
---
Releasing a Game on a different platform like a PC Game on a Console is more than Controller support. They would need to rewrite a lot of the Game backend like the Rendering. Consoles have also some Plattform specific Rules like Menu format, extra QA for Games and a fee for every sold Game.
---
I came here expecting to see something nice.
---
This.. is not nice. There are not words for this. Words would only insult it. Holy shit, well fucking done.
---
[This](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play) might help you pick a class. It's hugely down to personal preference. 
---
For gearing up while you level, use heart quest vendors and buy bits as you need them, replacing things with more powerful things. Power is the main damage stat, so that's one to keep an eye out for. 
---
For playing with other people while leveling, look for dungeons in the LFG (say you've not done it before) or maybe a world boss fight if you want something big and crazy. Your character will be scaled down in low level zones so fights are never not challenging. 
---
Welcome back!
---
Definitely my first Lupi solo for me! I remember thoroughly analyzing Lupi solos on youtube (including yours) to get enough hints and finally pulled it off with using two blocks and endurance food on warrior haha
---
As much as I love gw2, i would never play it if they have business model as the one you suggest. In gw2 China you can get a lot of stuff just paying which doesn't really make it worth much to me. And billing by minute is a big no, I mean I can't even explain how much time I waste just standing and talking to guildies or wait for events or wait in crafting. 
---
These simply seem like milking every bit of money from the players and give them stuff for money. I mean I wouldn't feel proud of some of the stuff I unlocked by sheer grind if anyone can just purchase it. Nah..keep it away.
---
...he xD
---
Better start by choosing a class you wanna play, then a race you like, the only effect for everything aside from class is personal story from 1 to 30 :)
---
I like humans and charrs (they're like kittens) but I have one char of each race and class, you can always create more char later, just dive in ! 
---
I have a norn guardian so i might be a bit biased towards that... 
---
in terms of the classes you've listed, I've never played engi or necro, so I cant really speak on that much, but I personally find guardian really fun and i've heard GREAT things about necro and wanna make one for my next character.
---
in terms of race, they're all interesting, I think sylvari are the most fun in terms of character creation just because of their appearance, and I definitely enjoyed the sylvari story a lot.
---
It's all up to you, based on my personal preferences I'd be leaning 1 or 3, but that's just my personal preference.
---
(Also, on a free acc, you have 2 character slots, so you definitely don't need to worry too much about any commitment to the first character you make)
---
Clearly Sylvari Necros are the best (not biased at all).;D
---
Jokes aside, why not take a look at the starting areas and see which one you like best. Maybe look at racial armour or how amour looks on different races.
---
I'm located in US central. 
---
In terms of skills etc, no race is better than another.
---
It comes down to what you want to look at while playing the game and what starter zones you enjoy the most/find most beautiful.
---
I really love the Norm starter zones, so that was my first character.
---
Although you can play any starter zone from any race (you have one fasttravelpoint (called waypoint in gw2) unlocked in every races starter zone.
---
And I like the chart because of the 2 walking animations it has, depending on if your weapons are drawn or stowed. It's a bit nicer (for me) to look at when it changes from time to time. :)
---
Hope that helped at least a bit :)
---
There is no ‘best’ race. The human starting location is pretty neat, I dont really like the Sylvari &amp; Asura ones due to the jungle but thats just my personal opinion. Charr and Norn location are also pretty cool. 
---
may i interest you in the FAQ from two days ago ? https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/at3k7q/tips_faq_welcome_to_wvw/ 
---
I hate everything about this post
---
This isn't the BEST way or anything, but personally what I do is:
---
1. Dailies (2g)
---
2. Tequatl every day (1g + loot, also I just really enjoy it)
---
3. Daily fractals when I can 
---
and if I'm feeling like it/have time:
---
1. Silverwastes meta 
---
2. HoT metas (each give u the option of an amalgamated gemstone at the end which sells for \~1g50s on TP) 
---
I think my main advice would be do your dailies, it's 2 gold and 10ap free every day, and they take a half hour at most.
---
If you’re very into the story, Sylvari might be the best race to start with, as you meet an important character earlier, which arguably improves the story telling. 
---
Due to their size, big characters feel slower and more powerful, which impacts your game experience a bit. Actual speed is the same for all characters. 
---
Overall, GW2 is a rather alt-friendly game, it’s not that unusual for players to have several main characters. 
---
The laypffs had nothing to do with anets profits being low or anything
---
Maybe you should have listened to that inner conscience.
---
Currently using this build for fractals and also open world stuff, how is it still holding up for the current meta, if there’s any? 
---

---
Many of the negative replies are about the economic model sections where OP talks about doing billing by the minute (plus the fact that they seem "happy" that people got laid off for whatever reason).
---
I would say it's around heroics in terms of mechanical difficulty alone. In practice it's made easier because hard carrying by a few players can be a thing and dps checks are practically non-existant.
---
Large characters will make you stick out in a group, which can be a bad thing if you're not the best player in a raid PUG for example. From my experience, the more hours you play the smaller your character gets. So while I had to use a total makover kit to shrink my norn guardian I actually prefer my asura these days.
---
Iirc pres have this saftey question, where you have to type in their name before salvaging.
---
I've rerolled quite a few times (I have 2 eles, 3 necros, 2 rangers, and one of everything else on my main). I have done map comp at least 12 times, done core story several times, ls2 3? times, HoT/Ls3/PoF twice at least and all of it at least once on my alt account. I'm currently on PoF for a complete story playthough with a friend.
---
  
---
If you don't think you'll craft legendaries (for yourself or to sell) or do PvE stuff I wouldn't bother with map completion. Ranger does need some completion as you have to go track down some of those pets!
---
Story takes a while - there's a lot of it. However, if you know your class, you'll breeze through most of the combat and shout at your screen for characters to talk faster. I'm currently only spending a couple of hours here and there progressing through 1-2 chapters at a time.
---
As WvW is your endgame, you're probably better off keeping a "story character" where you do your story/complete maps as they come out if being consistent on characters is important to you. I've moved on to having characters that haven't done personal story or HoT, but have done LS3 and PoF etc. Only one or two end up with it all.   
---
There is also a balance patch coming Tuesday - so things might change for various classes so its probably worth waiting a little if you still have to invest in gear, but it seems like your plan for getting your soulbeast through WvW is solid. I typically level everything with tomes and spec them with testimonies too. The beauty of the game is that you can have every class geared and ready to play without having to grind the same things. 
---
It is indeed very random, it's all a matter of experience. A bunch of people that run the old dungeons still love to make use of the many niche situations in which you can save a lot of time by cutting around huge corners by using guard sword 2 or thief sword 2. There's also an ele skill but I don't really know what it is off the top of my head due to retiring mine, something to do with weaver.
---
You're thinking of Weaver Air Sword 2.
---
Works the same way as Guardian Sword 2.
---
I do.
---
Sure you find them to be the ugliest, I bet theres atleast a handful of people that love em =P Thats just opinion for ya

Or, to be frank, drop fifty bucks in gems.

The funny thing is that you never know what you will get. When you pug, its like a lootbox. You can either get god players, or complete trash.

Yesterday I joined a 50LI FC W1, thinking it was some sort of training. I was expecting to get VG and SW and I would pug the rest myself today. The run went flawlessly and we one shotted every boss with ease. 
---
A few weeks back I joined a 200LI FC W1, they struggled to even clear Gorse and gave up at SAB cause no one knew how to throw bombs or dodge flame wall .. 
---
Kill everything.
---
Yep that's the one. I have never used the skill myself so I wasn't sure which number it would be.
---
That looks like the meta build, which is still using a fair amount of kit action. There's also the no-kit build, which is very straight forward and will slaughter anything below champs in open world.
---

---
I want this with some backlight LEDs on my wall! Great job.
---
You're probably right, misremembered.
---
The game makes too much money right now for a Steam release to be worthwhile
---
May I ask when the next one might be. I desperately need this but will be out tonight.
---
What I would pay or give to go back to then and how alive the game felt...
---
Just like the actual expansion!
---
PoF has spikes that make you dismount, so it's in the game already... that would actually be quite cool from a defensive point of view. 
---
Yeah, Sw/P is decent. It relies more on mobility than on the stealth/burst from daggers though, so you can't put them all in an hiearchy from best to worst.
---
It has the best cleave potential of all core weapon options (staff probably beats it), so it's great against bigger groups of mobs. If you swap the offhand pistol for a dagger, you change the playstyle entirely, where you give up some cleave for even more mobility/evade. Not recommended for pve but it's a cool playstyle nonetheless. Seeing two Sw/D thieves duel each other is something straight out of Dragonball!
---
I used to raid with a guy that was godly with his DPS he was disabled and played with an Xbox 360 gamepad
---
What server are you on?  Most servers have a discord or TS3 to join. Once you get on one of those, you will discover which guilds are on your server, and which commanders run open for you to join on, and who is commanding at any given time.  Many commanders will require you to be in discord or TS3 in order to join squad, so you can follow with the group. Don't worry about being required to speak or having a microphone. The important thing is being able to listen to your commander.  I would suggest going to EBG as a newer WvW player.  It is the most popular map, particularly for casual or newer WvW players, and commanders will be a little more patient because they expect it.  If you want to get serious about WvW, you should go to the metabattle website and go with a WvW specific build and an on meta class.  Right now I would recommend a "hammer backline herald" or "power scourge" build. Neither is complicated to play and both are on meta right now.  "Support Firebrand" is also always useful, but is more difficult to play and the minstrel armor is a bit expensive to put together if that is a concern. Don't get frustrated and give up, WvW is much more fun than PvE once you get into it and find a good WvW guild to join.
---
But he/she's ***out*** tonight ;)
---
Are balance changes super huge or usually just minor tweaks
---
Right, but none of that makes sense with Arena.  
---
Even at 100% boon duration, each application only lasts 4 seconds, and at a rate of 1 stack per second, the first stack is falling off by the 5th application.  At a 5 stack max, every single stack should apply; the 11th tick would still clear the 5-cap limit as the 7th tick (and older) had already expired by then.  It's mathematically impossible to have more than 5 applications at once if each application lasts &lt;5 seconds and is added once per second.  
---
I get the rules of these particular game mechanics, but those rules aren't working correctly on this specific skill.  
---
That's an "A~~ction~~RPG".
---
Just want you to know I saved this because it's very motivating for my own personal projects, ty.
---
Dang, my condolences. I just got this skin the other day and I hadn't even unlocked gliders yet. Had no idea it was supposed to be rare until googled it and found this post :0
---
The problem are commanders from the second group, that's why I started leading most squads myself.

I guess I will try being there 30 minutes in advance next time. I've done it like 10 times in total so far and roughly half of the time it failed for me in EU. Maybe I'm just getting incredibly unlucky.
---
That's beautiful. Gz!!!
---
Fashion Wars will most likely become important to you in the future. Coming from GW1, at least personally, I had enormous trouble being satisfied with anything I would come up with for anything that wasn't human/norn.
---
Additionally, human and norn starting zones are generally considered to be the best ones afaik.
---
Finally, Guardian is generally considered to be one of the most noob friendly classes because of their versatility. They also have multiple meta roles in raids, so in the long term you're not shooting yourself in the foot by picking a "useless" class.
---
Nord Guardian would be my pick.
---
I doubt I would be getting anywhere with a single tag on a meta with four lanes.

People who have never been in this situation. It’s also pointless to try to describe it to them, grief needs to be experienced. You can’t blame them for not understanding, but you can blame them for being fuckwads about it 
---
Already did 3 of those too :0
---
As someone mentioned, sword/pistol is grat for cleaving. Pull mobs together, blind them with pistol 5, lets the sword do its job.
---
Maybe this is something that works in your country but would kill any game in US or NA. You kind of have to accept that we do things differently just as i accept that your country do things differently. 
---
Imo i would appreciate if you first do some research of how different things are and why they are like that before you tell us how we should do it. 
---
No this is the perfect time for him to fire himself along with Mike Z.
---
Assumptions. Until there’s detailed reports or project papers released, we will never know why NCSoft didn’t like those side projects. The thing is an investor can pull the plug anytime, even if they just dislike the projects (whilst they can run self sufficient or profitable)
---
Either TP flipping or make your own best gold /minute.
---
Gold comes from all sides in this game
---
If you like pvp then do pvp and you will earn a great amount of gold over time.
---
If you like world bosses go do them
---
If you like doing meta events than hop from one to another for tons of loot.
---
If you like fractals go do daily fractals.
---
But nitpicking multiple ways that give you a large sum of silver-gold in a very short time, and then stacking them in 1 hour of gameplay can be even more profitable than anything else.
---
Things like doing your daily achievements in 5-8minutes for 2 gold coins is great!
---
Or parking alts on "material hot spots" where you get 20-50silver worth of materials within less than a minute is also great,specially if you can return back every hour and collect it back as the nodes respawn.
---
Crafting ascendant crafting mats and selling them takes seconds ,but can make you like 20-100+ silver depending on mats and market price.
---
Another way to get gold is to not hoard stuff or materials you dont need, or you will need for "later" (which never comes).
---
 Do you really need 250 copper ore? Do you really need 250 ecto in your bank? Sell it.
---
As someone that does TD on both NA and EU i am calling bullshit on this sorry. The fail ratio would be only 50% if you are always in the last map where basically ppl are spamming to join other maps to begin with. The fail ratio is like 5% maybe less otherwise.
---
10-15m early is fine usually but not always 30m is a better time + you do some actual events too help organize whatever. You'll notice the success rate goes really high once you are in those maps.
---
Hey folks, I've started playing recently and I've got a couple of questions. I've decided to start with a thief. I've heard that everything except for warriors, rangers and necros can be a bit complicated, so I've decided to look for some info on high-end PvE gameplay to get to know what I might wanna improve on as a player. What I found, however, were dps guides for d/d thiefs claiming that if you want to do the best damage, you just have to keep autoattacking and press 5 pretty much every time it's available for backstabs. So the questions are:
---
1. How much decision-making does a high-end player generally have to do?
---
2. Is dpsing as a thief really as complicated as I described?
---
3. If so, are there any classes that require correct usage of multiple abilities even on a target dummy?
---
Sorry if I've offended anyone with my ignorance. Thanks in advance and have a nice day!
---
Another one heh...best of luck to him.
---
Who is the other one?
---
Reminds me of my last run, I was in Nuhoch (the only map running meta, maybe halfway through the day?), we got tier 1 shroom stomped with 0 seconds on the clock. 0. Never will I ever see smth that close again.
---
The legendary Bearbow Math will never be forgotten. Alas, another god has left Tyria as it seems. Best wishes for the future, Chris Cleary!
---
Hooray.
---
I have 43 characters so i just want to let you know that you should not delete them. Play them to level 80 and then gear them up, give them a real build add the elite spec and learn to play it and then you know if this is what you want to play either as main or every now and then when you swap to something else for the day or because something require it. 
---
lvl 50 means nothing really. You do not even have a full build nor access to stats that will help you out. And the elite specs change everything about your game play and make it much more engaging. 
---
So i guess i did not offer you much help to choose but my point is don't delete them. Level them and play them as they should be played then you will know.
---
Can u make the face of Mike O Brien next pls :3 
---
Side hop, have enemy targeted and jump while strafeing. WOW OMG WHY DIDNT TUTORIAL TELL ME THIS COMPLEX UNINTUITIVE MECHANIC BEFORE.
---
WHAT THERE IS A BACKFLIP?!?! How could I ever find out.
---
lol......
---
Sssstab! 
---
Svanier Automata? 
---
&gt;LFG is empty or does not work (it just shows the loading circle, this happens quite often)
---
That's because you actually spam researches in the LFG.
---
&gt;Map is full
---
Yes that happens.
---
&gt;My home instance is empty
---
This is what I say Check in City Maps (outside LA) people offers Home Instance Farms.
---
&gt;I disabled map chat in 2013 because of the nonsense there and never have looked back  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I don't want portals, gliding or mounts for puzzles, it is cheating
---
Well that's your choices.
---
&gt;Map loading times are long (from 10 seconds to almost 1 minute)
---
Please... my loading times are approximatively 1+ minutes, but still for how easy and accomodating they are 2g is plenty. It took me no more than 15 minutes to clear 3, and I don't even do Events or PvP.
---
&gt;  Master of Monuments took longest because I had to wait next to the node until it was uncaptured. 
---
You know there is 3 WvW Borderlands Maps for those right? And there is 5 Zones per maps.  
---
No place for complaining there... I guess just try to optimize how you do your dailies.
---
Damn, that's sad.  I appreciate how active he was on this subreddit in the past, and wish him the best.
---
Just go in WvW, find a tag and start following it. Hit everything what other people hit, build everything what other people build, use siege if other people use siege. Follow tag closely. If you die, stay for a little while if someone tries to res, then WP and run back/wait depending on distance.
---
If there is no tag, do some generic mayhem, capture sentry spots, camps, capture mercenary "camps", kill guards around towers/keeps, scout, report enemy movement, build traps, fix walls/gates, make enemies waste their supply by using siege on their walls/gates/supply nodes etc.
---
Complete WvW dailies.
---
The tweet is gone now but when I first read it, I really didn't understand how this suggested moving on.
---
If you want to reroll a ranger specifically for Wvsw i have bad news for you...
---
This is why I asked what you're angry at. Your first comment was really abusive and directed at the player base for their feedback about Anet canceling the livestream, but now you're talking like it's anet you're mad at for firing the devs. You seem confused.
---
never forget https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqfUi9DzBuo&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
... because you can't find something to explore/map? ;o  GW2 isn't all there is to gaming. 
---
They only pop up for games that are dying? I mean, posts like these have been getting posted for over 10years on WoW forums, I've seen them on Rift, FF14 and Archeage forums too.
---
Godspeed, slayer of [J T Darkside](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bqfUi9DzBuo)
---
Isn't the max 64? Still, that's insane.
---
I've been talking about the same all the time, it's not my problem if you don't have any reading comprehension.
---
It's HoT, after all.
---
Wonder who is now going to take over supervising ArcDPS and other addons.
---
Lol thats actualy very true. I mained the biggest charr you can get for a year, then went human and now I main asura reaper. Gets smaller everytime
---
Yea tbh I think I am gonna start doing this and see where it leads
---
I remember there used to be some good engi builds without kits. You lose bit of dps yes but not that much overall. The only one I can currently find is the [Holosmith build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith_-_Power_DPS_No_Kit), if you have PoF.
---
1. It mostly boils down to positioning and counting auto attack chains. 
---
2. Yeah, pretty much. Some thief builds make more use of utility skills, but the class remains pretty straight-forward.
---
3. Ele and Engi are the top contenders for that one, since their builds rarely rely on auto attacks. Guardians would want their targets inside a Symbol for more damage, but it's often a [spam these skills off cooldown] kinda thing, whereas thief weapons don't have cooldowns to start with.
---
you know that chris cleary had another position since april?
---
you need to join at the :00-:08 mark you can also always start your own taxi and fill the map.
---
i dont know about you, but i get a 98 % susses rate, its probably the worst time to join on primetime and weekend where you have most of the "casuals" who just auto attack boss if even and die every second bolder
---
Can't be bothered to go back through his thousands of tweets so this one will have to do: https://twitter.com/Shazbawt/status/556671888072536065
---
You'd be surprised at what features my mother-in-law can turn on by accident.
---
I could also see a pop-up asking if you "Want to turn file compression on?" when disk space was getting low.  Who knows?
---
Assuming the metabattle build is correct (didn't check, but I'm not sure how they could mess it up), yes, that build is very good at the moment, especially for open world and low level content 
---
Ah, did they confirm it wasn't GW related? That makes me feel slightly better about GW2s future, still sucks for the 'other projects' employees though :(
---
 He should have lost his job a long time ago. He made the decisions that led to accounts being handed out by support without proper verification. Instead of being fired he just got demoted from Game Security Lead to Analyst.
---
XD not sure I want to see that crossover. 
---
Rev smoky infusion is also pretty cool.
---
Same problem for me, EU.
---
I saw someone recently linking a site that shows a timers for world events, but I can't find the link anymore. How do you track when each thing is going down?
---
Which website would you recommend for GW2 builds? I’ve been using meta battle for a long time because that’s the only gw2 build site I’ve found, any better ones or is metabattle the best one? 
---
same here

The most badass moment I've ever seen from a Dev.

Same for me....
---
you made my day :)
---
Same heer.
---
same
---
Just tag up and get more to do the same. Its piss easy to organize td
---
I've been trying to find a source but can't right now, but I remember reading a dev's response that basically when the game was released, multi core rigs were a little bit niche, so they planned for single core focus expecting them to get more powerful, as things generally do in computing. Instead, the industry moved into having several less-powerful cores.  . 
---
Since then, they've tweaked what they can to use modern systems more efficiently but it's fundamentally a single thread and this limits some aspects of the game. 
---
down for me too
---

Lögän Tháckèry Xx

I think they might be working now?

anet are closing due layoffs confirmed
---
Germany calling. Dead door knobs here.
---
It's less to do with dx12 and more to with Anet expecting single core CPUs to carry on getting more powerful while Intel and AMD realised it was more efficient to go multi-core. 
---
Even with the dx12 proxy, you do get some increase in FPS but the main problem lies elsewhere. 
---
Thank you
---
This would be brilliant! 
---
Best of luck to him, gonna miss Chris though.
---
Ah yes, the slayer of the hacker Darkside.
---
Build templates would have given the development team a lot more support from the community.
---
Be it apples or oranges they both use the same primary resources water, light and oxygen.
---
Players aren't happy with Gw2...no matter what topic is brought up it always disolves into dissent.
---
Which I don't see as a bad thing...I mean...You are measuring simple features in YEARS with failure to implement. Game development isn't this....impossible task. Management however... \*Side eye\*
---
The thing is though when we look all the way back...yes all the way to 2013.
---
It's like Anet has been nothing but reactionary. They are never ahead.
---
It always takes some kind of dire situation to get anything done.
---
Was that not what spurred the interest of PoF? "We need an expansion ASAP" After sales dipped hard after HoT?
---
It's exhausting. Waiting...and waiting and waiting...while the simplest shit never gets taken care of.
---
Then it becomes painfully embarrassing years later.
---
You can build an entire game but can't create build templates?
---
See it's that type of decision making that makes players dismissive of the dev team.
---
Because it's exactly stupid. I know you think I am mean...but, I mean how do make excuses for being able to sit in chairs...instead of Build templates. How!? Who made this decision!?
---
Stop and ask yourself something.
---
How can game design be difficult to the people working on the same damn game for 8 damn years! How!?
---
I stopped giving the dev team that excuse after a year. If your game is so difficult to work with. Fire all of your managers. All of them. Game design is not that difficult for these people. The only reason it could be is if they've built the thing to be difficult. Which again...is likely a problem with management.
---
So I argue just like many of the things Anet, "didn't have the talent for", build templates are a very VERY easy thing to implement compared to all the work the done to make the entire game. Not including annny of the expansions.
---
I'm not coming at you I just don't see how people can keep making excuses for this team after 8 years.
---
I mean it's always funny how the things the community collectively wants the most are always the most impossible to achieve.
---
I think he means private servers.  People used to make their own servers and host them for their friends or whatever.  Access to GM powers and whatnot.  Not sure if it's still a thing.
---
Ah that would make sense, thanks
---
Nice paragraphs, I meant chase after commander squad though.
---
I always feel so lame when I die to another roamed though lol.
---
In raids boons are covered by chrono and druid.
---
Achievements from stories are unlocked accountwide so if you have a new character, there is no need to do the story again unless you really enjoy doing the stories. You don’t really need testimonials for the HPs. Find a HP squad in PoF maps and it takes less than two hours to have all the HPs you need and more fun than grinding in wvw(testimonials are actually more useful to buy runes and sigils if you don’t have a lot).
---
As for world completion, it depends...Unless you want to craft legendary or really enjoy doing world completion, there is no need for it. 
---
That is quite the speculation you are making. His post could also mean the exact opposite of what your title is suggesting
---
We need a WvW guilds to entirely roll Norn and cosplay He-Man and She-Ra for the patch release.
---
They most often are on Sundays. There is also one during reset.
---
i reroll about 13,5 times a day
---
&gt;Good riddance. Hopefully this time time, you won’t end up in a job where you can covertly install spyware, and ban people when it returns an empty string. GW2 will be much better without you 👋
---
Top response.
---
Eh, I remember having to deal with Darksides hacking in WvW. He was super obnoxious to deal with and it was good see that our reports did something.
---
Nah, the background is white sort of lightly crinkled paper aesthetic, with a green &amp; yellow dragon. It was everywhere at release. 
---
Maybe creating a new character to explore again, but with limitations. For example, no fast travel, no mounts, pacifist run (only kill when absolutely necessary, most heart have non killing options to cleared them), etc. 
---
Yee
---
Repair walls. AFK.
---
Thanks! I put alotta time into it and I'm so proud of how it turned out! 
---
I wouldn't mind having more legendaries... 
---
Thematically, Mage &lt;&gt; Elementalist, Warlock &lt;&gt; Necromancer, Paladin &lt;&gt; Guardian.
---
From a play perspective though, it's a big harder to compare, because of how varied classes become using different weapons.
---
This. Also would love to have a map feature to show all allies on the map, instead of relying on someone to tag up.
---
Thanks for the info! 
---
Are there builds you can use after a level boost that doesn’t require all the mastery points you need to unlock the required skills?
---
Basically just a build that you can run around getting your feet wet?
---
Thanks again.
---
Thanks for the advice! 
---
Mage would be closest to the Elementalist
---
Warlock would be Necromancer
---
And Paladin would be a Guardian 
---
Yeah, the innuendo was all through. 
---
PVP and WvW, really - though WvW is arguably easier to get into as its culture is somewhat unique, whereas the GW2 PVP experience is the exact same thing as every other PVP game, only with GW2 mechanics.
---
&gt; Call me a red commy bastard, but protecting consumers from these practices is a government's job if you ask me.
---
I agree comrade. Government should be the tool by which we with no power can fight against those with it. But when we're talking about companies that operate out of banana republics like the United States that sort of practice will never end. You might as well ask the unicorn that shits gold bricks in your backyard to fix the problem.
---
There's only so much that paper can render. As soon as I'd finished it, it would burn into flames that would consume me for my arrogance!
---
Or not. But better not to risk it. 
---
But isn't that also very speculative on your part?
---
My friend and I made a pact, whenever we get a precursor drop we will quit the game know we have accomplished everything the game has to offer. We made this pact 5 years ago and are still playing daily...
---
He was moved from head of security after the shit show that was the April banwave. It's likely that he was let go after more information came out about it.
---
Damn haha I bet you would get a Statue in LA for this Project !!
---
You can always check gw2efficiency to see if you have the skin unlocked. 
---
Hopefully pof finishes sooner. 
---
That explains a lot
---
To add to what others have already said, how about the shitshow that was the race to world first on the [Triple Trouble Wurm](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1x7gvf/the_trick_to_the_wurm_head_kill/)?
---
Or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/1xb1ez/arenanet_monitoring_wurm_event_to_prevent_players/cfa4ssi/) link.
---
Best of luck to him, makes me wonder how many ogs we have left now though.
---
Problem is that this sub is divided into two groups. The logical thing thinkers and the very loud haters that will both attack anet for any mishap and will shit talk anyone that even remotely thinks positive about the situation and call you pro-anet or a fan boi. This sub is a toxic cesspool of vitriol and salt. 
---
Oof. 
---
You must have misunderstood me. By "copy-paste" I don't mean a literal process of taking one piece of code and putting an exact copy in another place. That wouldn't bring  us any new content. On the other hand, developers can - and believe me, they should - reuse the old code to create a new functionality. This way, they can save a lot of time for more demanding tasks (such as writing code which does something unique from project's perspective). As you can see, there's no need for you to teach me how to do my job.
---
What I was referring to is lack of new ideas in what they keep delivering to us. How many new ideas have you seen since HoT came out? All we were given are those context-based mastery skills, meta-achievements that reward us with a new skin per episode. Oh, and a new map with a new ore/whatever which is being used as a currency on it or salvaged into yet-another magic.
---
Story wise, we get episodes which are very similar to each other. You speak with Taimi, progress through an instance somewhere in the "old" maps, then you get moved into the new map. Then, you speak with some npcs on the map, go for a "finale" and it's done. 
---
I doubt that there's any new tech being put into use with the exception of animations, which have been greatly improved in the last few cinematics. To be honest, I believe the devs might have created some kind of internal framework or a domain specific language which let's them create story content relatively quickly, but limits what they can create.
---
As for the new mount, my opinion is more or less mixed. I'm sure that they needed a lot of resources to add mounts to the game, especially since it was never designed to include this kind of mechanic (we're talking about GW1 engine being used here). On the other hand, adding a mount to a game which already contains several different kinds of them, well... I'm sure that programmers didn't have the hardest job to do here. Most of the stuff a mount uses has been there at least since PoF came out and I doubt it they're doing a lot of changes in the game engine given its age. Unless ArenaNet programmers have been very disciplined since the first game's development started, the engine might be in a state which makes it extremally hard to maintain.
---
To sum up, I cannot agree with you on this matter. If ArenaNet was quietly planning to turn GW2 into a side project, it would be possible for the programmers to prepare tools or frameworks which would let them create new stories relatively quickly. I cannot guarantee you whether that is the case or not, but given how slowly GW2 development has been progressing in the last year, there's definitely something going on behind the curtain.
---
I wouldn't mind that. Or maybe sell it to anet once it's primed and given a coat of white. 
---
And they only realized that because someone had been threatening legal action through GDPR. It just took that long for them to give up the hash, where someone else immediately realized their error for them.
---
Seems like just a bit of fun, I haven't seen anyone use 1337 in an unironical context in, what, the past 5 years?
---
That's hilarious, your second link is my own comment, had completely forgotten about that.
---
I know a lot of people appreciated how much he communicated on the subreddit, especially since communication is one of ArenaNet's biggest flaws, but his banwaves were just one shit show after another. The smug ass tweets that he kept having to delete off his Twitter after it came out he fucked up were just the cherry on top.
---
Is that Quilling? I LOVE quilling. One day I'll take the time to try and learn it. It looks fantastic, great job! :D
---
Well wouldn't content fall under 'game service'? As a service is something that is provided and content is that service. 
---
&gt; under every map is water if you glitch under it you can voidjump in pve and youll get teleported to the highest point above you
---
this got changed on PoF release.
---
It seems you're out of punctuation marks. Have some of mine:
---
...................................,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
---
A rather large number have moved on, particularly anyone previously associated with the WvW/PvP team, not that there ever were many to begin with.
---
Quite a few are now at Amazon Games.
---
The amount and type of fun you're going to be able to have in WvW depends entirely on the server you're on, the servers your server is matched with, and the time of day you're able to play.  This last bit is the most important.  In my case, for my time zone, there's a lot of SEA/OCX activity in the mornings, a lot of North American activity in the evenings, and it's painfully dead afternoons and late nights.
---
When I play, I play during peak SEA/OCX times, as those commanders are very goal-oriented and don't talk much outside of direct game-relevant information, while the North American evening commanders exemplify the deficiencies of multiplayer gaming.
---
TLDR; if it's dead try playing at a different time of day, if you can.
---
I don't think it's that nobody else saw the source code, but you're right that he wasn't reading through it after every update. They had an agreement with deltaconnected that holds him liable for it, but it's still full of cheats now, anyway.
---
He banned me for an empty string, while cockily talking about how many "cheaters" he had banned on Twitter. And that was only the most recent in a long string of fuck ups related to ArenaNet's banwaves and his deleted Tweets.
---
I dislike the guy intensely, but I don't really see an issue with either of those links. The first is a joke, and the second is informing people of a specific action that's considered an exploit (which ArenaNet is not normally very clear about).
---
10 years after and I still log onto gw1
---
Played this game since release for nearly 4 years and didnt get a single prec, then I completely stopped and occasionally came back to sell some stuff and at some point tried my luck in the forge...bam, first dawn... then it became a habit to come back every so often to try my luck again and so far I am at 7 precursors drop... it is ridiculous
---
HoT gives the glider which nowadays is not that useful. But HoT maps are much more populated and with better rewards than PoF maps
---
PoF gives mounts which are pretty much mandatory these days. When you finally get the raptor for the first time... it’s like night and day. But PoF maps are not as rewarding
---
PoF maps are horizontal, HoT maps are more vertical. They are pretty unique and can’t be compared to any core game map
---
Both PoF and HoT go on sale from time to time
---
Living World are smaller updates. There are currently 4 seasons. Season 1 can’t be played anymore, watching a recap on Youtube is quite recomendable because despite not being able to play it, season 1 is very important to understand the story. Season 2 is weird, it’s much slower than newer seasons and is more story focused, it doesn’t include any new map (Dry Top and Silverwastes are unlocked for free to all players). Season 3 is where things get interesting, each episode unlocks an entire map and they are all very unique, each of those maps also has a very interesting mastery to learn. For example in Draconis Mons you shoot vines to travel like spiderman, in Bitterfrost Frontier you use Koda’s Flame to fight the cold, in Sirens of Orr you invoke the power of the gods through music, etc. Most of these masteries can only be used on its respective map, though. Season 4 is where we are at. The maps are all in Elona so I hope you like desserts. The masteries are now related to giving all mounts additional skills (giving your mount your health, faster endurance regeneration, and jump dismount that can be used even in the air)
---
Each episode is unlocked for free simply by logging in as long as it’s the latest episode. So you’ll have to buy all episodes except the last one if you started playing just now
---
I recommend seasons 3&gt;4&gt;2. Because of story continuity and because season 3 maps are one of the best ways to acquire ascended accessories of any stat combination. I think that living world pack you mention is only season 2 so it’s not too good
---
Got a link to where he owned up about it?
---
... That's the first I'd heard of this art style. Thanks for introducing me! 
---
My recommendation is, whatever you decide, make it feel like that character is picking up the mantle from your GW1 character. Personally, that gives a lot more life to the whole experience.
---
That said, based on your current leanings, you have a few different ways you can approach this.
---
- Norn are all about pursuing legends. It isn't far off to think a norn would want to make sure your GW1 character's legend lived on.
---
- My first character was a charr engineer. While it's not particularly easy to connect them to the legend of a GW1 character, I kind of appreciated the idea of the "spirit" of the GW1 hero moving on to someone so completely different than them. It's less dedicated, but almost feels more surreal (in a good way) to me.
---
- Sylvari are pretty new to Tyria, but gain their initial knowledge of the world through the Dream before they're born. It could easily be set up in your mind that the spirit of your GW1 character chose to guide a sylvari necromancer to continue their legend.
---
Though, if you're not nearly as sentimental as I am about characters and their backstories, then don't let this affect you. Other people in this thread have had some good advice regarding profession/race relevance.
---
Do you think the mounts are going to help or mess up with the roaming?
---
TIL, didn't realize he had stopped being security person.
---
First of all, I don't make fun of the ants I step on while I'm going to work.
---
Second, the level of incompetence was more than just "stepping on ants." They literally banned players for an empty string, then refused to look into it.
---
Third, I was a partner at the time I was banned. I would have hoped that at least warranted a secondary investigation, but apparently not. That only made it worse when I told people I was innocent, since everybody else made the same assumption.
---
The dude was both incompetent and an asshole, but some of reddit never realized that because they liked him being one of the few devs who communicated.
---
ArenaNet as a company apologized by e-mail... after fighting a GDPR request for 9 months so somebody else could find his mistake XD
---
Me neigther:( -&gt; grats!!
---
they are fun regardless
---
Others have pretty much said exactly what us the truth. Mesmers are much more like illusion battle mages crossed with a rogue/thief. Revenants can heal but its kinda weird.  
---
Guardians are thematically paladins but be warned that if you want to tank or heal in the game you might be better picking something else. The elite specialization Firebrand (unlocked with path of fire expansion) can heal and us one of the better healers in the game but its a vastly different system then running Holy. All heals are AoE, there is no way of single target healing in the entire game. Theres only 10 man raids and tanking is different. For most bosses its based on who has the highest toughness. So anyone can tank (theoretically) but historically Mesmers elite spec Chronomancer has been the best tank in the game bar none for 4 years now. But that is just from PvE
---
For PvP, either the PvP game modes (like 5 man BGs) or WvW (like Cyrodil in ESO) guards are the backbone of a teamfight, providing much needed heals and tankiness through things like regen (a HOT and the only one in the game) and Aegis (free blocks) as well as some crowd control. They are pretty beastly in the right hands still in both game modes.
---
It depends IMO. It depends if the roamer(s) value speed or subtlety. If they value speed, using the mount would be good. If they prefer to remain hidden as they travel, better to stick being on foot. 
---
I can't tell if you are proud of this or not. Upvoted because its neat fan art though.
---
It just makes 'wholesome' the wrong term to describe it.
---
Good luck wherever you go Chris:-)
---
No worries, and welcome back to the game!
---
aaawww big thx i rly happy to hear that, both that the vids help and that you find new music. :)
---
Which prove the point even better, as the WvW dev team has basically been a revolving door for a few years now.
---
The planned stream was cancelled, probably because some of those people are now out of job and the "Alliances" plan? I doubt we'll ever see it. 
---
For real XD I can't think of another picture that better suits the feeling of a precursor drop 
---
In a security role, it is literally your job to prevent mistakes from happening. 
---
Sure let's play **rated** matchmaking to casually grind your reward tracks even tho you can do it in unranked, who cares if your teamates are actually there to play a competitive match right ? 
---
even if you get rightfully called out because you play like a headless chicken watching Charlie and the chocolate factory, you don't care cuz chat is hidden because they are mean ofc. 
---
I honestly think this kind of behavior is contributing to kill even more the gamemode. 
---
That is still a massive assumption lol 
---
We don't know if any of the WvW/PvP devs have been laid off. You can believe what you want but its best to not spread highly possibly false rumors around. 
---
Hero points come ten at a time in HoT and PoF maps, so it's less awful than it looks. There are frequent "HP trains" led by commanders for people who want to unlock everything quickly. 
---
Look for core builds if you just want something to start you up 
---
&gt;chris ive got a bump on my nuts, is this intended behaviour?
---
You should really get that checked.
---
The news about how the company was structured has put all this in a new light for me. Of course all these things were overlooked, because everyone was being siphoned to other projects. Imagine being the one or two people responsible for security there and being told to secure the game while not being given any people to help you. You'd put in draconian bullshit without properly vetting it. Doesn't mean he gets off the hook for it, but I empathize. Everyone there must have been so stressed and the reward now is mass layoffs.
---
You should gear him up. He's meta in Fractals and WvW, and possibly raids? (Fractals as DPS+Quickness. Although i play it as quickness+healer; WvW as main tank/healer/frontliner) 
---
Gratz! That's how I felt when I made my shield precursor.
---
The barrier to getting to ranked matches in PVP is brutal, especially if you suck at it - you have to wade through a seemingly endless hell of Deadeyes and Mirages and other bully-builds, as well as players vastly better than you'll ever be, to unlock the ability to play ranked.  It's the equivalent of being mugged by six different street gangs just to get to the gym.
---
Complain about the game design and you'll get the usual "git gud," "mad cuz bad" and other denigrating comments.  The best thing about PVP, far and above anything else, is that it's entirely optional - if you want to make a Legendary you have to complete the WvW reward track.  PVP has no hooks, and that's definitely a feature.
---
im happy he is not at gw2 anymore. dont back ever.
---
That's the meme.
---
Paying 10-15 bucks per month and then getting all dlcs and some pocket money like in ESO is nothing like what this thread describes. Im all for the ESO business model, though then Anet would also have to deliver content instead of fluff.
---
They saw the future. :)

While I agree with all you said, the fault doesnt lie solely with Chris Cleary. Anet cut corners on security. Didnt pay or develope botshields, probably also went for cheap servers so the kind of automated flagging system you'd need cant be run on them, and to top that off, I know that they outsourced a lot of the reviewing of flagged accounts to save money. 
---
He did okay for what resources he had, but ofc the attitude was... not really helping. But I wouldnt go so far as to say he's incompetent. Just that his attitude and anets cutting corners at times made him look like it, when in reality he's most likely anything but.
---
&gt; but it's still full of cheats now, anyway.

I wanted to make this post due to the fact that we never got the Warclaw stream. Major condolences to the devs after a very difficult week.
---
I wish to talk about the potential capabilities of the Warclaw and pros and cons of using it in WvW.
---
First and foremost the Warclaw has 4 capabilities. One of which is just allowing players access to faster travel speed and 3 different skills.
---
The engage skill being some type of pounce, which at this point we have no idea if it can do damage, apply conditions or both. This skill can be very good or detrimental depending on how it's balanced. I've heard from some sides of the debate that it shouldn't do any damage and only apply conditions, or very low damage, etc. I personally think that it should do some damage, but not so much to take even one third of even the glassiest of classes like eles. I think Vulnerability and Bleeding could be good conditions that the attack can apply as well considering you're being attacked by giant cat claws. They should not have a hard CC like knockdowns. That can certainly break the game.
---
The Chain Pull is a siege skill used to break down doors. (Other structures not sure if they are effective). This skill probably makes you completely stationary. Now in terms of balance, I think it should do between one sixth and one eighth the siege damage of a Ram. In other words, my balance would be using 6 or 8 players on mounts on a door is the equivalent of one Ram. Not sure if using this skill also requires supply, but I highly doubt it. Using this should be a better alternative to a group of players than just spamming their AoEs and Auto attack the doors. Using this may leave players very vulnerable to attack and dismounts if they aren't paying attention to their surroundings.
---
Final ability is a Evade skill that looks like a Raptor leap but with Evasion properties like the Jackal. Not so sure what the distance is on it, but I'm guessing slightly less than a maxed out Raptor. Although it could potentially be upgraded if its upgrade are unlocked in a similar fashion to other abilities in WvW. This should be very useful to of course dodge attacks, use it for quick escapes when things go south and potentially give zergs a method to attack another zerg's backline and such.
---
With all that out of the way, I want to make a list of "potential" Pros and Cons for using the Warclaw.
---
Pros:
---
1. Faster travel: Pretty self explanatory. Should feel good to reach places faster, have it break falls for you if you run off cliffs and of course eliminate that sense of moving so slowly when you first hop into your team's base and desperately trying to reach your zerg on the opposite end of the map.
---
2. Siege supplement: As long as it's as strong as I mentioned earlier, this should be a good extra for siege combat.
---
3. New engagement options: Fact is the evasion can add a new element for combat. Being able to jump through the backline of zergs, sweeping camps like a Calvary and new pushing methods available when attempting to capture keeps and of course go through the insane bottle neck that always happens in Stonemist Castle halls. It shouldn't be used as a primary method of attack due to a few cons I'll mention here, but should be good enough for some potential high risk, high reward play if done right.
---
Cons:
---
1. Large Hitbox: Frankly, riding the mount makes you stick out like a sore thumb. Almost every player will see you coming. Might not be a good idea to use it if you intend to sneak into or around structures.
---
2. Low health (Potentially): The Warclaw could have an average health of 6k. If I were to give it a highball number, I'd say 8k at most. Would make sense for a Warbeast to be made strong enough for war, but of course we'll have to see for ourselves how that goes. But regardless, having a low health pool makes you quite vulnerable to getting dismounted real quickly with high damage attacks. And we all know how bad it's going to get when you get knocked off. About 2 seconds of you bouncing off in place will make you very susceptible to more attack that will kill you quickly. So yeah, make sure that doesn't happen and run when you can.
---
3. Not great for pure combat: A fundamental aspect of zerg combat is to make sure that everyone in the group has boons applied to them. Without boons, zergs can die off really quickly and can't do much damage. With that said, you will lose access to your utility skills while mounted on. Best thing to do in that case is to make sure that everyone gets off their mounts as soon as they see an enemy zerg to then top themselves off with boons before engaging.
---
Overall, my recommendations or thoughts when using the mount if everything I've mentioned is accurate:
---
1. Every group will use the Warclaw mostly for quicker travel.
---
2. Havoc groups will make the most of the mount given that they mostly avoid engaging zergs and just capture objectives.
---
3. Using the Warclaw offensively can be very situational. It to me shouldn't be used for pure combat. Only used during certain scenarios.
---
With all that said, I hope I've hit the nail on some things, but of course we'll see how it goes when it goes live. Hope you've enjoyed the read and add anything else you've thought of down below.
---
This is old news. He deleted his Reddit account, removed Anet from his Twitter profile, and stopped interacting with the community in any way months ago.
---
Sorry to burst that bubble, but in gw1 we had way worse failed banwaves and chris cleary stayed. Most likely because anet cant get anyone else to do that crappy job with the minimal ressources available to do it for them.
---
Im pretty sure, he wasnt let go at all.
---
Also, he wasnt really moved from head of security, his job description just got re-named. Theres no head of security anymore afaik.
---
Some salty cry babies in this thread and the Twitter one. Just wish the best and don't be a whiny cunt.
---
Nice!
---
To add this this, the anet devs themselves don’t know yet lmao
---
Dude, whatever. I literally do not care anymore about trying to educate you. Go be ignorant and hateful and calling people shills like it's still 2018.
---
Ok cool, thanks. Now let me get back to doing fractals on my staff ranger since my boon Mesmer just died. Although I might just say screw it and queue PvP on my Condi Tome Guardian since it counters those damn axe condi Mesmer so well.
---
Why do you curse us with a photo of your screen...
---
Yeah, I can separate his attitude from the stress he must be under. And, I mean, I would get his attitude as well in his position. Consider how many fucking stupid kids he bans who come up with sob stories "oh yeah, that was totally my brother on there pls unban!" People are idiots and cheaters are even bigger idiots.
---
It was a really captivating project! I was always really impressed with the hot logo, and wanted to give it the respect it deserves! I feel like this did the job. 
---
Appreciate Clearlys cooperation with ArcDPS. The green light he gave on that was a good day for gw2.
---
I agree as well. You've captured the essence of the design perfectly!

Rating do means something for you and I, the silver gold low-mid platish players.

It means nothing for high players. This beautiful lad called ROM has yet again answered what does it mean when you say "Rating means nothing" https://www.twitch.tv/videos/384230270 about 1:20:00 i believe. So stop sheepishly repeating that. 
---
And yes, i can tell you a fair amount of regular PvP players don't care about rewards, im sitting on 3k gold IDGAF, hundreds of unopened rewards track IDGAF aswell, sure it's a nice bonus, but it is not why i primarly play the gamemode. 
---
oh yes, i forgot to post that, also there is an option where you can  keybind to temporarily lock the ground target on your enemy while holding the key down.
---
This is amazing! I'd definitely pay a lot for a copy of all 3 logos side by side
---
Did I miss something? You can also turn of chat in pvp. Something I regularly do because theres at least one rage-kiddy on every match that thinks he's a pro but in reality he's the problem himself.
---
The minimap spam might get obnoxious, but well... I just ignore that. 
---
PvP is just small scale wvw. You either roam, or you zerg.... depends on the build you are playing. If you are about to loose, you disengage to not throw points at the enemy team. Pretty much the same imo to WvW.
---
Hey man, his name is Mark, and he's doing the best he can alright. I know the capitalist pigs can be frustrating, but there's no need to take it out on Mark.
---
As far as usability goes, all depends on what type of game mode you'll be leaning on. I'm unable to tell you anything about PvP and WvW (mass scale PvP between three servers), but as far as PvE goes:
---
1. In open world, you're generally good to go with anything. As long as you know your class, you're safe as in open world "strength in numbers" is the key and apart from dungeons, fractals (scalable dungeons), raids, group events and map metaevents you are pretty much able to solo the whole content.
---
When we go to end-game content such as raids and fractals - necro is not much a good shot and tends to be ignored in favor of classes with more dps or utility (although it has its shining spots). If you want extremely high damage it would be either elementalist with one of it's expansion specializations (Weaver), or thief with expansion spec (Deadeye). And the skill rotation on Elementalist is much more complicated than on Thief.
---
Wow. I'm an idiot. =p Thanks mate!
---
Yup. Saturday and Sunday mornings seem to be the most common on EU certainly. 
---
so you have nothing but bullshit? okay
---
Well kicking the Fractal team - for example - would affect the game...
---
I know what you want to say, but OP talked about choosing between LS team and expansion team, which shouldn't be the case at all.
---
More organized groups can get away with less BD. For pugs you’re going to want to have a bit higher BD in case they miss a well or something.
---
I agree, although in ESO you’ve got real-time combat with blocking, interrupting, dodging, light and heavy attacks, jumping, etc.  And then you’ve also got all the other spells, as well as switching weapons on the fly to change your entire loadout, similar to GW2.
---
I know it would take a considerable amount of work to get GW2 playing comfortably on a controller, but, I’m sure it also took a considerable amount of work to get ESO and other MMOs on consoles as well.  I feel it’d be worth it.  
---
Its changed over the years
---
Trinkets are available in the forge room for laurels if you have a bunch laying around collecting dust.
---
So admittedly I have been away for a while, close to a year. This was mostly because I had an unbearable ping to the Europe servers from South Africa and I couldn't fight in any boss battles without dying close to what felt like a million times.
---
So we recently moved house and I got fibre which is giving me a significant improvement in speed and ping, just under 100ms most times, so I go to install the game and hopefully fully enjoy my GW2 experience.
---
Except, when I logged in just now after downloading the game I have neither Heart of Thorns, any of my old characters and my account has been downgraded to only having two character slots. 
---
So, I just want to ask, has anyone else experienced this and is there a way to actually fix this?
---

yea i mean after greed destroyed mobile gaming and created the mess that is the eastern mmo market..why not kill the final bastion of common sense and decency?
---
i can't wait until gaming becomes just logging in and spinning some rng wheel for 10$/day..maybe then you greedy bastards will be happy
---
Quite honestly: you dont need teamchat in pvp. Minimap is the only tool you need for coordination. Ah yes, and party window ofc. Teamchat is only used for verbal abuse and maybe some coordination at the beginning of a match - though havent seen that in ages, so not even for that anymore.
---
I got many friends unfairly banned because of the spyware. They were eventually unbanned, but they missed the whole of SAB. If it weren't for that redditor researching what happened, they would still be banned today.
---
Instead of admitting the mistake, they tried to cover it up and pretend it was nothing. I'm not one to hold grudges, but I'm hardly forgetful either.
---
get outta here with this pinko bullshit
---
It does make sense, just take a broader look at it. All the gw1 players have fore knowledge of the area. It'd be nice to go some place new then rehashing old content. It feels like i've been left out of something.
---
Actually its not true regarding raids. Scourge is a very reliable class to raid on and due to [this video](https://youtu.be/mPFU28vh5vY)  support scourge is quite popular and very effective at carrying raids. 
---
For fractals though this is true. Fractals is very burst orientated which means power specs and sadly reaper(necros power spec) is effective but kinda bottom tier. 
---
Tbh I would go guardian. You get a great power dps spec in dragonhunter, a decent condi spec in firecrand and also an amazing pvp/wvw support spec in firebrand. 
---
Since the last balance patch firebrand has been gaining more and more popularity in raids and fractals as a dps/heal support in raids and fractals. 
---
Good.
---
They don't stop dropping. Source: have chest, still drop. 
---
The whole reason you open bags on a level 50 is because that ultimately determines what tier of salvaged materials you get. You have the highest chance of getting the most expensive materials by using a character around level 50. You can sell these on the tp for better return than at any vendor.
---
Since OP talked about sPvP specifically that is what I refered to. I also have to disagree. Most places you cannot shadowstep are actually intentionally, as you are not supposed to shadowstep onto, say a mushroom that does not have a ramp leading up. Yes there are breaks in the logic in both directions (places you should be able to step to and cant and places you should not be able to step to but can) and obviously in a gameworld as big as this one there are bound to be a whole load of those breaks, but especially in sPvP it's not so bad when it comes to the newer maps. In PvE things are worse but pretty alright (even HoT) when it comes to places you are supposed to be. What makes HoT much more difficult is that the verticality confronts you more frequently with places you are not supposed to shadowstep to or actually places the devs didn't really intend for players to walk along at all. Mounts obviously made this "worse".
---
More likely he's trying to show his value to the company in the wake of layoffs.
---
Ooh this is awkward.
---
Rumor inducing? It did indeed read like he was leaving. 
---
News like the layoff announcement brings out the discontent, doom-sayers, rabble-rousers, jerks, etc.
---
I was thinking of it since everyone keeps asking for them haha. I can't really afford the gear for them though.

Call it Fake News, Chaba. You know you want to.

Inb4 he just wanted to see what reddit community thought about him.
---
Haha damn. Okay makes me feel better
---
Sure. Train up for hot and you can mostly solo pof stuff. 
---
250 LI groups can attract some real idiots. One time I was pugging at Cairn. The start of the fight went quite well but somewhere around 20% panic happened and 2 people got killed. Right after that 2 other guys who were alive left the group.... Still got the kill.
---
Its also frustrating to see 250+LI people ( even people with more than 750LI ) to get knocked back by Cairns AA over and over while they try to get to the middle... Guys you have a dodge button and that special action key..... USE IT.
---
Another strange PuG run was at a 200 LI W1 FC run. VG was a complete mess. First try was a wipe after the first green and second try also had some people killed before the kill. I thought that I was in for a quite  long ride but nope SW was smooth, Gorse was a really fast and smooth kill ( world eater cast only at the last phase, but that was because the tank had a brainfart and went to the walls ) and Sabetha was nearly perfect.
---
Someone with no accountability preaching conjecture about accountability.  Ass level:  Borat.

I will defitnetly do HP trains now. Thank you! I thought it would be slower than testimonies.

Sorry i just laughed out loud because Reddit since Thursday has been like

NO THEY DID THIS TOO.

NO HE DIDNT.

*BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW!?*
---
I DO, WE CAN JUST ASSUME THIS HAPPENED BECAUSE THIS AND THAT.
---
*EVERYBODY CHILL TF OUT.*
---
Its been comical if you think about it lol
---
Lol the need for the second post was due to overanalyzing the initial post. This probably just refers to the basic fear of incoming layoffs.

I mean why? I am not professional pvper, I don't care about my ranks and I play pvp 20% of my total gw2 time max; his point of view may be valid for him, but I personally couldn't give less fucks about rank; remove rewards - pvp dies and mr rom will leave the game to play something else
---
First thing that comes to mind is overheating of the GPU, it then downclocks until temps are below the max temperature target again and repeats this cycle. Get HWiNFO64 and monitor temperatures maybe?

uh maybe remove the post since its false information?

It's interesting how you started this literally cussing at the player base in general, supposedly on behalf of some employees there that you seem to imagine are having a hard time about their friends getting laid off. Where are you coming up with this, and why do you have none of this empathy for your fellow players? You know, I think I'm actually comprehending you quite well.
---
Good for you but I still will downvote out of jealousy 
---
Spyware and unjustified bans?
---
ignore naysayers, the game is good, fun and can recommend to anyone. 
---
the only thing bad thing i can say is how the game doesnt have clear paths until you hit lvl10, 20, 30 and so on. 
---
nor does it tell you to look things up with "/wiki quest/item" when youre unsure what to do next. thing can make new players feel lost
---
Norn starting zone is my favourite too - glad you are enjoying it.

In general? It was a response to someone.

&gt; supposedly on behalf of some employees there that you seem to imagine are having a hard time about their friends getting laid off

Attempting? Is it that bad? Everyone under damocles blade?
---
As GW1 veteran, none of stuff in GW2 is rehash - it is completelly different world.
---
It is very, very loose reintrepretation at best. 
---
&gt; It feels like you've been left out of something and they all have an advantage over you.
---
If that is your worry, get GW1 - it is just few bucks and is great game in its own right.
---
gotta love that this post and the one saying he is leaving are right next to each other on the feed
---
If he only has 20 left for every (race, sex, profession) combination, yes. 5x2x9-20=70.
---
However, I thought they didn’t support sufficient character slots to do that, which means he’d have to delete one/some.
---
Check out the Looking For Group (LFG) section of the social/friends window. On average I see quite a few HP trains hosted there for the HoT maps. 
---
I'm new and curious what they mean with this "difficult time"?
---
Twitter basically forces you to be vague with the character limit, though.
---
&gt;Tbh I would go guardian. You get a great power dps spec in dragonhunter, a decent condi spec in firecrand and also an amazing pvp/wvw support spec in firebrand.
---
I had actually considered the Guardian on the Power Dragonhunter idea(at the moment).   It's hard not knowing anything about a game which is so complex, and feeling like I'm making good decisions long term, in the short term.

Install GW2 TACO and you can see lots of things to go do on maps, collections, puzzles, etc.   I've found it helpful.  This is a pretty good install of TACO.  You will need to run the game in windowed full screen for TACO to work.

No it's not. Why would you ever think that Target, move, jump does some evasive bullshit? It's a pain to do on the controller, too because your hands keeps wanting to take your finger off the targeting button.

I had 100g, spent it all and was down to less than 1g. Got super upset, did a daily + some other stuff, and had 3g. Decided I wanted to actually have money, so I looked up some crafts and spent the next week buying ~300,000 Silver Ores and smelting them, doing some magic, and selling the result.
---
I probably could have gotten more than 1000g if I had optimized it better, but that was the highest my liquid wealth has ever gotten.
---
Would not recommend the strategy I did, the market on that stuff is fairly volatile and I got really lucky (being able to play it as long as I did). The silver ore market was affected by what I did for about a month or two after (~1.6x price? something like 20-30c instead of 15c).

okay so they communicated that they won't update the game as much as they used to do?

Think of it this way: if a new elite spec ever comes out, you can immediately train half of it.
---
My raid renegade rotation: dont use shortbow, spam mace autoattack and cast mace "2" off cooldown, on stance swap cast elite and "jump aoe" utility skill 1/2x in mallyx, when citadel bombardment is off cooldown swap to kalla, cast filler skills and keep autoattack / mace "2" until mallyx gets off-cooldown, then stance swap and repeat.

Is his referring to him changing positions at the company multiple times? I wonder. 
---
How is soulbeast in your opinion for wvw zerg?
---
I prefer when boons and conditions stack by intensity rather than duration. That is always more intuitive and keeps all individual stacks working, so you always know what effect your boons and conditions are going to have.
---
But with the way regen works now, the amount it'll heal when stacked it'll be kind of insane unless it had diminishing returns, and diminishing returns would make them counter-intuitive again.  
---
Hahah I mean, you're not wrong.
---
^ Useless comment. Move on.
---
If I blink I waste valuable time... 
---
I still call SMC DERP castle but I don't think everyone understands the reference ):
---
Because anet can't even get it right on PC. 
---
That's not how GW2 works.  Pick between either.  You're looking at like 10-15k and boons/utility.  Maybe 20-25k if we're talking specific boons like quickness. 
---
I think sylvaris themselves scream when I put them into industrial shredder before making my salad
---
She's also the bunny girl. 
---
Imagine fighting the tripple trouble wurm, having dealt with your head and waiting for amber when the screen starts blinking "INSERT COIN TO CONTINUE" like a house of the dead game
---
Not for me, I really like the guy xD.
---
Wow this is embarassing. I've been playing the game for six years but have never made a legendary until now. This is the first time that I realized that gen2 legendaries don't require map completion. Yikes, that was a lot of wasted time.
---
I _may_ have fixed the issue, although I'm not sure how it had anything to do with GW2's performance.  
---
Here's what happened: I compressed files on my C: drive because it only had 20GB free. I uninstalled GW2 and reinstalled it on my D: drive to further free up space.  
---
I was still having the FPS issues and did some forum browsing. Came to the conclusion I should revert the file compression on my C: drive and that seems to have helped.  
---
I'm not sure why doing this would fix the issue however since GW2 is no longer on my C: drive. But, I've regained 30 FPS (averaging at 60 in Tangled Depths atm) and haven't had any random spikes so far. 
---
It's not a repost though? Unless someone else posted this commission before, but I certainly didn't. What I DID do is post another commission with a similar title beforehand, but not this one.
---
Oh, I never noticed it being posted by someone else before, my bad. I'm the person who commissioned the piece, didn't expect someone else to post it here in my stead.
---
&gt;I am desperately hoping that the community is still alive and well!
---
Oh it definitely is. There are plenty of reasons to go back to starter and low-level maps too, so you might see some high-lvl players running around.
---
It depends on what kind of endgame you’re after tbh - necro is incredibly popular for world vs world, and used in a couple of raid encounters. 
---
Guardian can spec into a solid dps class with the HoT expansion as a dragonhunter- used in raids, fractals and dungeons. It also has some versatility in the PoF elite spec, firebrand. There it can either become a condi dps class, adjust slightly to pump out quickness in raids or a support character (primarily in wvw). Core guardian is still a fairly solid dps class. 
---
Oooooh this one blew my mind, thanks.
---
This gives me a lot more questions than it answers.  Why, in your chart, are stacks that last only 2 seconds persisting so long?  As in, why does stack #2 (applied at second 1) remain at 2 seconds when stack #3 (applied at second 2) is applied?  And why does stack #5 retain its 2 second duration all the way through stack #9?  
---
Boons are applied every second and lasting for two seconds each.  If each application is treated as a separate stack, I would expect the application chart to be visualized [like so](https://i.imgur.com/8CtzkzM.png).  New stack applied every second, so stepped at the 2nd of the last.  In this model, each stack before last is down to one second when a new stack is applied, meaning there should never be an overlap on more than two stacks—which would mean the boon's total duration should never exceed 2 seconds.  This is exactly how stacking works on separate condition stacks, but obviously not here.  
---
Conversely, reading the skill at numerical face value and ignoring the timeline, it applies 12 stacks of fury at 2 seconds each for a total of 24 seconds; given that it takes 12 seconds to apply them all, by the end of the skill there should be 24-12=12 seconds left of fury.  Which is exactly what it does.  But why?  Are the stacks *not* separate stacks?  Does applying a boon for 2 seconds to an existing 2 second boon just perpetually refresh each stack back to 2 seconds until it hits its stack cap?  Then why doesn't fury get refreshed 12 times so you leave with 24 seconds?  Or why does a base HLA extend protection 8 times if it's capped at 5 stacks?  
---
And [why does regen fall off sooner than protection on a base 8-second cast?](https://youtu.be/khOsRMLd8GQ)  Nothing about this makes sense to me.  
---
Yeah the vocal playerbase is pretty ridiculous, just ignore all posts regarding "gw2 / anet is getting doomed", these are ridiculous
---
Hello all, back again! This time with Norn and Sylvari inspired Jackal mounts. It started as a Norn themed Dire Wolf. I feel they're quite under utilized in game right now, with Garm being the only one I can find information on. As I was working on it I decided to do a plant version inspired by the [Fern Hound](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fern_Hound), another often requested Jackal skin.
---
&amp;nbsp;

I hope you all enjoy!

---
Seriously the amount of crap gw2 fans will swallow from anet is insane. 
---
The devs are incompitent, they release a game in which you are meant to swap your skills and traits freely yet don't include build templates. Build templates were a thing in gw1. Zero excuse. 
---
A bit late, but I never knew someone posted this here. I'm the one who commissioned it, actually!
---
Hnnnngh! I want to buy these so badly!  Really great work! 
---
They’re probably moreso referring to the general advice to new players about “don’t sell or throw away mats, you’ll need them for crafting professions later on!”, which, ofc, doesn’t apply to SW farming
---
Wow! Played this game years ago and had 3 drop in under 3000 hours. It was the two handed, the Dagger and underwater spear if I don’t misremember. Also grinded out nevermore. 
---
The one thing I agree with is that too many cosmetics are in the cash shop, and too few are available as in-game rewards. Part of the gameplay of GW1 was collecting different armor and weapon skins, and part of the fun of wow was getting different mounts in-game. It would give folks something to do in between LS and xpacs. Now that they killed istan farming, I really need something else to do in this game in between releases.
---
Strafe + jump = Side Hop

This is the most obvious thing ever. Everyone should be doing this automatically.

Is this build on the SC site? Can you link it?
---
Go for 100 Map exploration and demand a special title from anet ( i wouldnt be surprised if you wouldnt get one, or maybe a in game npc )
---
Why do you complete maps?
---
Do you use mounts?
---
Any preferable character type you like exploring the most?
---
You could :
---
* Start a new norn/human/sylvari ranger/thief and RP as a member of Tyrian Explorers Society (the guys who send you gifts after each 100% zone exploration and a letter).
---
* Do a new recorded exploration. Take screen shots , record videos, time events (view the swamp vista in queensdale just in the moment as the shadow behemoth spawns) and post them here, or on youtube. Make a series of it and show us EVERYTHING core tyria has to offer 
---
* Start a new challenge. 100% map completion with 0 deaths, no lvl boosting, limited gear acquisition (like you can only use gear from champ bags ,hidden chests and skrit bulgral bags) , limit skills on racial only skills etc, the amount of freedom of movement, exploration and build/gear progression is huge and so are the possibilities of a made up challenge.
---
* Dont forget jumping puzzles and mini dungeons! You can take everything from above, and RP as a thief adventurer looking for treasure and doubloons. Playing as a ranger offers an actual torch for those darker caves and mini dungeons, as well as the added bonus of finding and charming pets :)
---
This is usually what happens.  
---
Once people play the game; they love it.
---
The problem I believe is exposure.  
---
People just can't find the game very easily, mostly due to the lack of advertisement.  
---
I keep recommending the game, and people barely know about it and have rarely seen or heard anything about it, so they just assume it's some random forgettable game.  
---
Being left in the dark feels aweful. I haven't GW2 since the news, because playing an MMO for me is mainly a time (and somewhat emotional) investment, that I hope to get "returns" on. I don't play the game so I can have a bit of fun today. I play the game because I know the actions I do today will be present tomorrow. And knowing that the game could go potato-mode any day makes me anxious to invest any more time in the game or story.
---
Carry the Creator
---
Actually it's the yellow endurance bar iirc. If you click on health it can open hero panel in some circumstances
---
2019 marks the day on which players are complaining about too much free content and too fair an item shop.
---
I see the point though. I'd rather deal with 10% of the scum that gatcha developers use to make money than 0% and seeing the game being shut down in return.
---
S A L A D W O L F &lt; 3
---
The idea that they were building a GW3 goes in direct conflict with their statements that (paraphrasing) "GW2's engine is capable of everything we want to achieve for the game."
---
That said, I agree that it would be bold to make that kind of story twist. And it totally makes sense given what we've seen in the story so far.  However, I can't help but feel like that would be such a waste to end GW2 where it is presently.
---
Idk, I can't wait for ANet to *finally* fill us in on their future plans. I just suspect we won't know what's going on for sure until after Episode 6 drops.
---
that's an unusual workaround. glad you were able to 'fix' it though.
---
Thank you for not deleting your post. Google will no doubt lead someone else here one day and your answer might help.:)
---
We need THIS clip!
---
ANY TRUERS? LULW
---
I can assure that guild wars 2 is extremely alt friendly. Your first character will be slow to level because you are learning the game and doing the story but subsequent characters will be quick to level up and since there is no gear treadmill you only have to worry about gear once per character per level. 
---
So dont sweat the first choice to much. :) just focus on taking it slow, learning and having fun. 
---
Ps: keep in mind the story gets way better with each subsequent expansion.   
---
Got it. Very oddly written.
---
Welcome aboard, and enjoy the ride!
---
Can't say I disagree with him really, I feel very much the same in that the living story is very sub-par writing, characters all blend in to one (Sarcastic, witty, always something to say with quips and odd jokey comments), races all blend into slightly different shades of Human and don't have any racial qualities of their own (Rytlock in the newest story, Braham the non-shapeshifting Norn, the cutesy Asura). It has just become very stale and I talked myself into "But there is something great around the corner, there must be as there is so much potential!" but really there doesn't seem to be, looks like we are just going down this same story beat over and over again until the cows come home.
---
Only 1 stack can tick down at a time. It's like a queue, new stacks are put in the back and only the stack at the front ticks down. When the stack in front has run out of duration it is removed and the next stack in the queue starts ticking down. So instead of your stair-representation (which correctly represents when the stacks get applied and the individual duration of each stack) [this](https://i.imgur.com/58jGTZ8.png) might show how each stack is ticking down. In the case of the image where the stack is full (5 stacks) a 6th stack would not be applied since there is no more room (which happens with HLA on the 10th and 12th stack for protection with 0% boon duration. The 11th gets applied since the active stack has run out at that point and there is room in the queue for 1 more stack).
---
And yes, for intensity conditions (Damaging conditions and Vulnerability) and boons (Might and Stability) all stacks tick down at the same time.
---
Regarding the Fury, Fury can stack up to 9 stacks (along with Aegis, Alacrity and Swiftness according to wiki). And you will only have a maximum of 7 stacks on you at a time with HLA with 0% boon duration, so you won't run into the same issue there as with protection. With 100% Boon duration it should skip the 12th tick for Fury though since it would reach 10 stacks at that point.
---
As for the last part about regen I made a whole new post after doing some research (thanks for making this post to make me aware of this btw, [link to that post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/au9w04/regeneration_durationstacking_with_the_same/) if you want to know more about a related issue). 
---
The rules for regen duration stacking is different from other duration stacking boons after they changed it to make the boon stack applied with the highest healing power be prioritized. The basics are that stacks of regen are put into the queue backwards compared to protection. They are put in from the front and pushed back into the queue when a new stack gets applied. When the queue fills up and a new stack is applied the oldest stack gets removed even if it had duration left over. 
---
In the case of 0% Boon duration HLA that means every stack of regen loses 1s of their duration since a new stack gets applied every second, except the last 5 stacks since they get to tick down their full duration without getting thrown away.
---
For regen that means 7 of the stacks gets to tick for 1s before thrown away and the last 5 gets to tick for their full 2s duration for a total of 17s of regen.
---
Protection skips 2 stacks since the queue is full at the point of application for the 10th and 12th stack, but all othe stacks tick down their full duration for a total of 20s of protection.
---
Fury gets it's full 24s of duration since it doesn't hit the stack cap of 9.
---
Since the skill has ticked for 11s after applying the 12 stacks (first application at 0 seconds), when the last stack is applied there should be remaining on your boon bar 6s of regen, 9s of protection and 13s of fury.
---
A lot more duration is thrown away for both protection and regeneration (and possibly Fury) with higher boon duration because of the stack cap :(
---
Yea, rapid application of short duration duration-stacking boons is a mess imo.
---
Sorry for wall of text. I hope some of this makes sense and doesn't confuse you further.
---
Not good advice here. Better do not use siege if there are other people around because you do not have mysteries in the begging and other will probably use the siege in more efficient way. Also do not build every siege you see. Sometimes trolls put siege and you will be just wasting supply and you will not have when it is really needed. Do not join any commander but pug-commander. Most guilds do not want you to add on. 
---
Best advice is join server's Team Speak or discord. They will have builds for the class you want to play so you do not die a lot but also help your group at best. Probably also some videos on how to play. Also you can find pug-commander and listen to him while following and you will understand how things work in wvw faster. AND don't be discouraged if the commander sounds mad sometimes. It is part of the experience. :D
---
you have confused customer feedback with individual job performance critique, and a company with its individual employees. That's what's nonsense lol
---
He's not wrong.
---
What many of us in the community found out this week is that money generated by GW2 was being funneled away from further gw2 development into other now apparently failed game projects. The idea money from my purchase of gw2 gem sales is getting funneled to a guaranteed cancer mobile game (all mobile games are cancer) instead of the game I play and spend money...  Ugh.
---
Yes I understand it's a company and can't exist long term from only one game but ArenaNet seems to have a huge execution problem and one has to wonder how ncsoft views that.
---
Game is super active. Bad troll
---
VERY cool! Missed all the previous ones, thanks for linking back so I could see them :D
---
I guess we'll see if they decide to hype us like they did with HoT when NCSOFT was their publisher (which they are now again) 
---
* Rando Asshat
---
I'll admit, that gave me a good chuckle. Take your upvote.
---
Also how humanity in general works.
---
But somehow we all get along. 
---
This week has been really enlightening about how, for example, the WvW community has a very vocal minority who have the PvE community. PvP largely do their own thing, and that thing is ask for balance patches for mirage. 
---
In game, I've almost exclusively had good experiences of all three, including having WvW comms supporting PvE people going into EoTM for the first time, but discussion boards are another thing entirely. 
---
I play a bit of all three modes so I know that it's not cut and dry, but enjoy my average-quality shitpost.
---
I can't really disagree there.
---
While I don't agree that the Living Story is complete trash, at the end of the day, I think we're all hoping that it's building up to something. We can't have bombastically huge-scale updates all the time. I mean, just from a storytelling perspective, that would suck.
---
But ultimately, the current Living Story feels like a transition from one big thing to the next. And I'm perfectly willing to believe that, given the recent twists, we may need another season to ramp up to the next big thing. I'm personally fine with that.
---
But if there *isn't* a "next big thing," or ANet's promised "new system for developing content" doesn't make Living Story significantly better, then I can see this all getting old very quickly.
---
So ANet needs to speak up and tell us what's going on soon. Previously, I've been willing to wait until after Episode 6 (just seems reasonable to announce things between seasons), but after the recent news, I don't think that's enough.
---
Communication has been sorely lacking for a long time now, and now is when communication is needed the most.
---
The whole stream had some choice rants.
---
I'd like a virus to be named after me...
---
Oh cool, the snake who hijacked my computer with spyware is staying. How delightful. 
---
call back after  3 months,when you gona grind same fractals aka endgame XD
---
Video running in a loop since 10 minutes because it feels so good
---
maybe not everyone likes Facebook and what it stands for also?
---
I viewed LS as the glue between expansions. Now that we have a missing expansion it's not substantial enough.
---
Yea, balancing intensity stacking regen might be challenging. Either diminishing returns or a stack cap of for example 3 or 5 + a nerf to the current scaling could work, but yea.
---
It could be interesting and as you said it would get rid of the duration issues ;)
---
"rando asshat" was the best part of this
---
100% agree, having side projects is fine, putting near all your resources into said side projects while your player base (especially those who have been playing gw2 for 6 years) , who has been through alot of aggrivating moments over the years , believes you're putting your heart and soul into the game is just disgusting.
---
anet is never at fault until reddit frontpage force you to admit it
---
Usually things on reddit and forums are much more wild. In game you dont see that much toxicity not even in WvW (depends on your server though)
---
The he’s embraced the “rando asshat” title haha love that guy!
---
Surprisingly some people actually enjoy all three game modes. Shocking, I know.

What i do in any new account is:
---
1 - Lvl a character to 80 doing map completion (not using that BS booster)
---
2 - I just start PoF story to get the raptor
---
3 - I finish the map completion with the character that i lvled
---
4 - i do all fractal Archivemtens that gives mastery points available without running the CMs(eventually i do those also but after i craft ascended gear)
---
5 - I get all tyria masteries until Auto-loot
---
6 - I finish to get all tyria mastery points needed to unlock all tyria masteries **(49 points)**
---
7 - i start HoT story  and at the same time i start gathering all the eziest HoT mastery points (that includes stronghboxes and some archivements) i do that until i get **144 HoT mastery points**.
---
8 - finished that i start the PoF Story and the points gathering as well
---
9 - Now i with the materials that i got from doing all that i start crafting ascended gear.
---
((( NEW PLAYERS )))))
---
9.1 -  as you are new to the game go to the [snowcrows.com](https://snowcrows.com) website take a look at the builds, they work at wold map and are perfect for any content PVE WISE.
---
9.2 - PRATICE THE ROTATION ON THAT BUILD.
---
((( end of new players))))
---
10 - I start raid in that account (as im exp player i just say that it is a alt account and ppl are pretty chill about it, for you i would say to be real and join a TRAINING GUILD, THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD TRAINING GUILDS OUT THERE LOOK AT THE FORUNS)
---
11 - I try do ALL RAID Wings in that account until i get enough LI for Leg armor (this one is a progression system cause you have a week cap for that)
---
12 - i Farm 300 gold in order to buy a commander tag
---
13 - i start progresson on fractals, this one can be skiped if you find a friend to pug t4s with, but as a you are a new player i **STRONG ADVISE YOU TO JUST GO THROUGH ALL THE FRACTALS....**
---
thats it, after that is about dailies, legendaries and fashion you just gotta set goals, i know that it is a video game but sometimes you will endup having to do things that arent that fun, in order to get into the good stuff.....
---
I like the innocent librarian look.
---
I want to make one of these, but every square is an angry neckbeard. 
---
&gt; In WvW you are rarely running into waterspirits because you are quite mobile, and waterspirit is the only problematic source really because it applies high healing power but short duration regeneration.
---
Firebrand applies plenty of low duration high healing power regen stacks, especially if they run legendary lore through mace symbol and F2 tome. 
---
Hey if anyone can help me would be great got into gw2 and tried installing gw2 hook by following the website instruction.I get this error everytime i start guild wars 2 or load the game 
---
Yeah, by the way, do you know if the regen ticks strength are determining at application by the caster to the receiver or when they actually heal the person?  I.e. if someone applies 30 seconds of regen to you with 1k healing power, and then unequips all their gear, does the regen start ticking for less heals?  If it doesn't, that means they are already doing a similar calculation to mine above in order to account for things like temporary healing modifiers, in which case adding in the little +duration/10000 would be quite easy.
---
Can we get more asura hairstyles first?
---
And everyone who was working on them was laid off, so what's the issue?
---
888 Lanterns in the guild hall !
---

---
he is right... why spend resource on other projects when you have 1 of the best mmo in your hand that needs update expansions and stuff....
---
Get out with this sjw bullshit
---
I replaced the textures and shaders files there was from reshade when unzipping so that shouldnt be even happening i really dont get it ill try to do as you said for now ( i suck at these kind of stuffs)
---
Or maybe they're well aware that karma whoring posters giving this more exposure than it needs to will just result in reddit blowing it out of proportion, as it always does.
---
ofcause the game is calculating the path of a projektime based on the speed and the direction of the target that means when you stand in some range to an enemy and the enemy uses a slow flying projektile that doesnt has the ability to trck you it will get shot in your walking path . The problem is when you quickly press adadadada (rebind that to starving or hold down rightklick to starve )  etc the game thinks you go in one direction but you stay on place  so the enemy will miss you everytime because projectiles will go past you on the left and right side
---
It wasn't the moderators removing the last one. 
---
I asked nicely for it to be deleted, since I don't believe these clips are a fair representation of context of the discussion that was ongoing on the podcast.
---
It is not a spyware and GDPR is totally unrelated to this. It is about handling personal data which was not even close to being touched by Anet. But ye people on reddit know better (also mostly false positives.. yeah right)
---
You don't have to know how to PvP to play spvp. You just need to know which builds are meta and be able to rotate. Trash players in both modes but let's not kid ourselves that being able to meta game a conquest mode is the equivalent of player skill. 
---
Needs raid players added in.
---
Nah, I just need my bonus endurance regen from food so I can spam the dodge key more as mirage to PvP :)
---
he didn't realise his name had changed
---
Please do post the result
---
You know Deroir asked the last one to be removed
---
There's a lot more pve players who dislike wvw/pvp than the reverse imo
---
 This is why the chinese/korean market is full of shit p2w endless grindy games and mobile games.
---
because its stupid not to do that. nobody in the economy does that, when they dont have a monopol on their product.
---
they gambled, they lost. but to say he feels betrayed? pls. how stupid can you be to think every dollar they get from you gets 100% back into the game?
---
Savageroir. Wow, that sounds like pokemon name. 
---
Very true, I forgot about firebrand. Thing with herald is that you dont have long and short duration regen stacks, so its not that much of a problem. But yes, firebrand has a problem there.
---
Aaaah she's currently doing one for me, can't wait to see how it turns out! :D
---
That does not change a thing of what i said. You could run after a pve mob it still would be your choice. If you have tunnelvision then this is something you have to work on instead of blaming the comander for stop the chaice and move to next fight. 
---
Also had the same problem with the file magicbloom! Do i need this file and what it does ?
---
Perfect.
---
No to mention this is how a lot of projects are funded in companies. They take resources from one to fund and build another and not just in gaming.
---
[Then, everything changed when the PvE nation attacked] (https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/tame-the-warclaw/)
---
Ooh, I have that one, being able to control every utilities and mount skill/dismount with my thumbs is fantastic
---
This has always been my experience with every company I've worked for. Even so much as some "labs" or portions of the company fund new "labs" from their success. 
---
Like most companies I would imagine Anet had no intentions on telling players the inner workings on how they funded project X . And when successful most don't care how it was funded. If GW1 wasn't a success on some level would there be a GW2? And so on.
---
Bots make it to plat bud epeening that you reach tiers in spvp is laughable. If you're trying to say that there are very bad, often very new players in wvw then yes you're correct it has players of all levels. What's laughable is thinking spvp is any different. 
---
You work for Bioware?
---
1. Combat is fairly action-based so every player in PVE endgame content (fractals, raids) will need to be making constant decisions about positioning, dodging, doing mechanics, delaying high dps skills for certain windows, etc. all the time. So even if your DPS rotation is easy, a good portion of your attention will be dedicated to these mechanics, since missing them can get you or your party killed.
---
2. DPSing as a thief is generally very straightforward, that’s just the nature of the initiative system. Daredevil and Deadeye have similarly easy rotations, with some minor coordination between some of their utility skills. This makes thief a decent starting class for learning raids and fractals, since you’re free to focus on learning the mechanics without constantly staring at your cooldowns. The reason why thief may not be considered an “easy” starting class compared to say, warrior or necro, is because it is very squishy and has more difficulty handling multiple mobs at once. You’ll need to dedicate time to learning to dodge/making use of evade frames and using your many utility skills to survive.
---
3. As core classes, engineer and elementalist will probably be the most complex. With elite specs and for endgame content, it really depends on the particular class and build you’re playing, For example, sword weaver (ele) rotation is easier than the traditional staff ele. And although most thief builds are straightforward to play, rifle deadeye (thief) has a punishingly strict rotation that’s very difficult to pull off to its full potential. Furthermore, looking at the rotation alone may not give you a good idea of how difficult a class is, since there are often additional mechanics or buff uptimes they need to keep track of to maintain good DPS.
---
In general, if you’re thinking about gameplay and viability at endgame content, GW2 is fortunately a very alt-friendly game! It’s quick and easy to level and gear up later characters if you ever feel like trying out other classes, and I highly encourage doing so later down the line.

Do you use the lfg-tool? Each meta in HoT are on a schedual, http://dulfy.net/2015/11/09/gw2-hot-maps-timer-famme/ this is a webside that show you exactly were the meta is at now so you can keep track on when a new one start. Often the pre events are not as populated as before but it is usually done just not with a flock of hundred people but a few at each and people calling for help if needed. Some times coms put up squads for pre events too. 
---
Anyway when the meta is about to start about 20 min before you should check the lfg-tool and see if you can find a squad. There are often several maps open and sometimes they are full and you might have to speak up in the chat and try to organize the one you are on and put that group in the lfg-tool to get people in.
---
In EU i even done Dragon Stand in the middle of the night not so long ago so even at off hours it happens that groups are up. Maybe harder to find but still it happens or you make it happen by doing your own squad.
---
I never said I dislike the LS system. 
---
Just that a lot of the content surrounding it isn't good and lack depth. I've always been transparent on my streams about my opinions, expression myself in the same line as you've seen in one of the clips (though less "on the nose"/exaggerated, as is portrayed in the clips from todays podcast).
---
Context matters. Which is why these clips paint a worse-than-reality picture for people like you that do not watch my content.
---
Most friendly of gaming communities, sure, but that still doesn’t make it an entirely friendly community.  I mean, WvW got a mount and the community response was a resounding “fuck you” to the secs for not releasing other stuff they wanted more.
---
I haven't played the episode, nor the map yet. \\o/
---
They didnt just start on a few side projects to branch out and/or ensure the future of the company. If certain twitter posts are to be believed (and for me thats a BIG if, since the source is known for exaggerating), then the majority of anets employees were working on those "side" projects, without those projects being financially going anywhere - otherwise NCSOFT wouldnt have cancelled them.
---
THATS what players, including deroir, are angry about. Not that theres side projects. But rather, all that drought we veterans experienced since HoT, was for nothing because anet went and put the majority of the earnings from gw2 into projects that went nowhere.
---
Yeah, because there are many times more pve players total. 
---
In relative numbers this likely isn't true. I think most pve players just don't reallly remember that spvp or wvw exist.
---
They could make the regen scale with one's own vitality, like how you get more barrier with more health, but give more barrier if you have more healing.
---
So with min vitality, 1000, and 25 stacks of regen with min healing power 0, you would get just a baseline healing. Then the more vit you have and the more healing power the one giving the regen has, the more that healing from regen increases. 
---
That way it'll need 2 stats for full power, without having to have both stats in the same character, allowing for more tradeoffs as whoever is being healed will be able to bring less power.
---
where are you getting the info to support this claim? from what we've been told, they don't know who is being laid off yet. all we know is that they have *claimed* the layoffs will not effect GW2, afaik there have been no announcements about *who* is being laid off specifically. hypothetically, if your statement is true (which there is no evidence of) then it's still bad for gw2; if what a certain misandrist says is even half true, they have been steadily moving people off gw2 for months / years and left a skeleton crew behind to keep up appearances (which hasn't really worked) so the people being laid off would be people who should be moved back to the gw2 team. again, that's all just hypothetical, we still don't know who is being laid off yet.
---
Have my down vote. *shiny* 
---
Yes, but anet funded FAILED projects. Dont forget that little fact. They took that money and basically just flushed it away. Repeatedly, if we want to believe that whole story.
---
So please stop trying to make this into some kind of good business decision. It was not. It was very poorly done, and things like that have bankrupted many, many game developement studios.
---
The pace is too fast to learn.
---
If you can record your screen, record it and replay what you recorded at a lower speed. You will learn more from that that from many videos and guides, and those guides that would teach you better than the video, would teach you more with the video.
---
There is nothing wrong with building up their business and expanding to other projects.
---
The problem is they've had issues keeping a consistent release schedule and quality level for their only game that was funding all this work while simultaneously funnelling resources from that game into these projects with nothing to show for it.
---
What makes it worse is they've at times proudly claimed they have a habit of scrapping all work and starting from scratch multiple times over, this was especially bad with the state of the HoT release that through away all the work they did setting up plot threads for the area &amp; back story only to release a complete mess instead.
---
The gw2 era ANet have had real issues with project planning &amp; management and they never should have begun work on other projects before this was sorted out.
---
My point is that people are always negative, and I am losing hope because of how negative people in general all.  Widespread negativity, criticism, etc cause havoc on a game like this.  People who are considering playing don't play, people stop logging in, playing, etc when it seems like everyone around them says that the devs don't care, don't ever get updates right, etc. The mob blames the devs without stopping to realize the impact they themselves have.  It's going to kill the game if the devs don't.
---
GW2 development has always been problematic  with many things started but then not continued, just like Arenanet as a whole.
---
&gt; sounds like
---
&gt; to me
---
Glad we got that cleared up.
---
thats quite nice of you :)
---
I don't see how this can be taken out of context, but if it is link the full stream
---
It's in decline because they moved rescources.
---
Time ago I create this thread with useful site for new players : [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8nhwb6/useful\_sites\_for\_new\_gw2\_players/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8nhwb6/useful_sites_for_new_gw2_players/)
---
I expect no less from reddit; but thank you for your support.
---
i have  gtx 1060ti
---
it was still fun though and the game felt like they were still working on it, most of the time. lately it feels as if everything has just been abandoned except for the LS, which i don't have any interest in as i dont enjoy GW2's story. 
---
What sort of psychopath thinks this is obvious? For one thing, strafe+hop doesn't make a side hop, you have to be holding down the target button, and who the fuck lives their life like that?
---
No one said they had to pour 100% back into the game. People have just been dissapointed with the content (for various reasons) in the past few months, and then we hear (from a dubious source for sure) that the reason for that is ArenaNet not allocating enough resources on the game in favor of other projects.
---
Looking at Raids+Fractals/PvP+WvW, I think we can at most assume there's like 5 people each on these teams. But people believed that Living World at least didn't have these same resource limitations, so people of course became worried when they heard otherwise.
---
People have been holding out hoping for an expansion, people that have been pouring their time/passion/money into the game, like /u/Deroir, but its hard to keep expecting one now. Hopefully I'm proven wrong.
---
This is why other (MMO) companies provide communication avenues such as Producer Letters or Roadmaps, because the current insecurity about the game's future is tearing a lot of people apart. Sure, the community tends to become very toxic when a promised feature/release doesn't make the cut, but if you also can't consistently meet deadlines internally to commit to them publicly they also have a problem themselves, as a company.
---
The map looks nice, but that's it.
---
A good start would be to remember priorities and not strict rotations! 
---
For example: always use sword 5 over any other sword skills. Use sword 2 over sword 3/4 stuff like this
---
You're really going to claim that that statement can be misinterpreted? At best you were being hyperbolic, which leads me back to distrusting your stated opinions.
---
I think the reasons you've listed explain pretty well what's wrong with the game mode, but I'd like to also add an anecdote from my first experience ever with Southsun Survival:
---
I try it forthe very first time, load in the map and begin reading the instructions to know what to do and how to play. I wasn't even halfway through the first line that I got spawnkilled by some dude with a bow.
---
I was like "okay" and left.
---
I have played the Southsun Survival more since that happened but that was a horrible first experience.
---
Sidenote: I presume it's random and it's just bias of confirmation but I feel like tbe Daily Activity Participation is always Southsun Survival or Sanctum Sprint. Never Keg Brawl or Crab Toss (the latter two being so much more fun than the former two IMO) 
---
Thats effectively half price, i am only level 20 atm, so have plenty of content to last me till then! cheers.
---
No one said this was a good business decision. Nor was I implying such a thing. However TONS of projects fail and money is constantly flushed.
---
&gt;  I've also ruled out Necro due to their general unpopularity in end-game group settings
---
Scourge as a healer is incredibly strong in beginner groups, which you'll be in for quite a while as a beginner.
---
this subreddit likes to circlejerk about how easy necro is and how hard thief is but it's all false..just because you can kinda stumble around in open world with certain classes doesn't mean anything really, especially the amount of defensive cooldowns thief has i.e. dodges
---
so to answer your questions:
---
1)not much, it depends on your knowledge of the encounter..most of the scenarios are scripted so after you do them a few times you will know what to do, when to burst etc.
---
2)what you described is incredibly simple..what part is complicated? pressing 5 every once in a while and the rest is 1111?
---
3)yes every class requires a correct usage to get the best out of it..some(like thief) are more forgiving than others because their loop is insanely short
---
for example necro, the one this sub praises as the braindead openworld destroyer..necro has a simple rotation but it must be executed correctly or it gets punished a lot harder(dps-wise) for mistakes
---
or power soulbeast(ranger) has a lot of skills that root you into place so you have to think if you need to move in the next 1-2s or not before many skills
---
Play Guardian/Dragonhunter. Relatively easy rotation (all about making sure your modifiers are active and then unloading massive burst), lots of active blocks, insanely good for open world due to automatically negating the first incoming hit of combat (passive Aegis). With a second gear set you could easily also run healing/support Firebrand too.
---
Hm, First, Gw2 aint getting more resources because the other projects failed. The people working there are getting fired, not moved into Gw2. And many of them were likely working for Gw2 before being moved into those projects. 
---
Second, you're a big fool to believe that Anet would spend 100% of their time with Gw2. Its a suicide move not to invest in other titles and projects. Now, one thing is to do that right. Come up with a decent product, and be sure you can manage it. Feels bad certaintly hearing that these 2 projects, that took time effort, time and effort that could've been spent in Gw2, were wasted but thats how business works. They are likely now start buckling up from Gw2 and try again in a few years. 
---
Once again this is impressive !
---
You play GW2 like other randoms played Sims... But it's for the best ! The amount of time you put in these stuffs is very valuable. The result is always great.
---
&gt; reaper(necros power spec) is effective but kinda bottom tier
---
Reaper is strong in Fractals. It's raids where you're relying on a healer to mitigate damage where Reaper suffers due to the incoming damage hitting the death shroud meter without any way of restoring it.
---
I was banned, but I came back after the six months. The timing of the ban lined up with some issues in Tera, which is what I was playing in the meantime. I've stopped playing again when I found out the details of that banwave. The incompetence and willful ignorance just killed any desire I had to play. I was a partner with 19k hours logged and volunteered thousands of hours running community events. Now I just have no desire to play.
---
That is, till the first legendary weapon tickles.
---
You could avoid both and still be social online, technically...
---
I can't fault ArenaNet for wanting to diversify their "product portfolio," so to say.  However, what I will say is that as a player this past year I've felt neglected; and that ArenaNet started to cut a lot of corners with LS4 and make compromises that they wouldn't have been okay with in the past.  Whether we're talking the Rose Quartz disaster, the loading screen at Sandwept Isles,  ~~"Gandara, The Moon Fortress,"~~ Rollerbeetle vs. Kourna, or the wildly inflated cost of Requiem armor via Nullification Sigils this season has been a bumpy ride. 
---
I'm taking my time and money and investing it elsewhere; in myself, in other games and entertainment.  It just sucks when you feel like you're not really the true center of attention; like ArenaNet's been listening and participating in our conversation, but at the same time their efforts are scattered.  I want to judge them for what they ship, but lately, I'd rather judge other people for what they ship because they're not trying to please 5-6 different audiences simultaneously; the game just seems to lack a cohesive focus right now.  
---
&gt; usual anti-cheat

no it is not usual, stop commenting on stuff you don't know *** about

Made me laugh very hard

mmorpg are built for last long

You should write a book.

Maybe your skill was the illusion all along!

My first level 80 was a mesmer, I  found I liked playing mirage, and after a couple hundred PvP games I can hold me own decently (but I'm not that good, contrary to popular belief, the build is quite challenging to play).  Got tired of all the constant mirage hate though, sPvP has way too many vocally toxic players (even if it is a minority, they are very vocal), so I'm done with it.  It's demoralizing signing into a pvp match to see your own team ranting about hating the class you play.  Back to pve for me, where if I regularly run into really nice people who go out of their way to help each other.  Guild Wars 2 pve community is amazing. 
---
Memorizing =/= Understanding

That's why.

The positioning of the text makes this more difficult than it should be

They aren't going to move people back to GW2. The GW2 budget is not going to magically expand again.
---
their map are always gorgeous, the problem of the ls maps are not for sure the artist that makes an awesome job everytime
---
What kind of farming do you do in sandswept isles? I love the feel of that map and would love to farm there myself. 
---
I don't know which kind of bug Anet has that they like to give the most important roles to the most toxic, unprofessional people... 
---
The other day I asked customer support to recover a deleted character, they couldn't, but they were so kind and funny they made me chuckle. People like them SHOULD be the ones giving the information and communicating with us.

Not theme parks like GW2 unless you can afford to roll out a constant stream of content.

I'm a bit surprised that you think so.
