Well yeah it's irrelevant to him.

I think it'll be DCS world for me full time. It was the only MMO in whose setting I was invested as completely, and likely the last.
---
Yeah like bag slots... Wait.

---
Also PVP kinda has its own equipment system with which you can just use your non-pvp gear.

In all seriousness tho, people are just now realizing how bad these are.
---
You cant compare anet to a company like blizzard because blizzard can afford a few big fuckups. Anet was rolling, idk, 400 deep? And its fairly new compared to blizz who is an OG company when it comes to PC games. But i see similarities between the new Blizz and Anet. They went from quality content, to money grabbing, and now they're both going downhill.
---
I think that's pretty accurate, although probably better phrased as

**"This system is great for the overwhelming majority of their players and terrible for a very small sliver of the playerbase."**

Assholes exist everywhere. They cant be kept out of any community forever. Sucks that you had a bad experience.

I dont have any context for your experience here but just because you are wrong about the ep thing here and got harassed by some assholes doesnt mean you have nothing worth saying.

Looks like an upgrade to me...

How to retrieve chat codes from a build ?
---
Nor can you just a single game on a company's lay offs.  Guild Wars 2 reports its income quarterly and it's remained stable.  Anet has been working on other projects that didn't pan out and most of the people were laid off from those projects. Other people were put back on Guild Wars 2.
---
  
---
The thing is, you can't tell how Guild Wars 2 is doing, only that Anet had some failed projects.  And sure that will affect them. But right now, Guild Wars 2 is the only current game Anet has and it's providing enough income to support them.   
---
Anet's job now is to get another couple of titles out.  Doesn't change the fact that Guild Wars 2 is stable. You may have issues with it. I just don't see why I should care.
---
3:15 to skip to the crash, i included whole run for clarity of what exactly happened (i wanted to extract warhorn that got swallowed)
---
You understand the implication of the phrase "last straw"? Idiot
---
Archeage
---
&gt; ncrease the number of build and equipment slots drastically and start the player with a couple free slots for each game mode (PvE, PvP, WvW)
---
While I agree with the limit increase, they did state that they're working on a PvP specific template for a later date. They just wanted to release the initial load-out first.
---
&gt; Make build storage free, and saved locally with no number limit like GW1. Needing to pay for something that you can save as a link in a text document is crazy.
---
Honestly? This is what I hate the most out of this. I'm not bothered with paying for gear and build slots. Especially because I'll just farm the gems up. But paying for their storage is just ridiculous. 
---
I don't mind if the storage limit is comparably small but it should be free. Ideally, it should be "infinite" but we all know that's not actually possible literally. Even in Gw 1 there was a limit. Most people didn't reach it though.
---
I like the story. The new story is particularly good. I'm not alone in this. I also like the combat. I also like jumping puzzles. There's a lot of stuff I like. There's stuff I don't like too.
---
There's no middle ground because we're playing different games, which is my point. The stuff I'm interested in is not the stuff you're interested in and that would inform which games are good or not.
---
I think there are more people playing the content I'm playing than you probably think.

I am not really sure why you are discussing with me why my own post doesnt get removed.
---
&gt; And i dont drink coffee
---
You're loss.
---
I understand just perfectly what "last straw" is. But if you were actually an adult, you would just quit the game like an adult and go on with your life, like an adult. But instead, you did this. Like a child. A moderately overgrown child.
---
/thread
---
Probably something about templates, and just like them, its unfinished.
---
it's most like a free extractor :D or bug?
---
Lol, yeah, raids, fractals, PvP (especially), this is mind boggling why people just give up on the first wipe.
---
I would think of the character ones as build *loadouts*, as in, when you modify it, it changes right away. You can then save that *loadout* as a *template* on the account. You can then restore that *template* to a *loadout* on any character on your account, even if you have modified it.
---
LOL sure I'll add it I guesss
---
You can paste in a build for any class into your account storage. You can only paste in ones for the class you are on into your character storage.
---
I like the analogy with recording TV shows when they are broadcasted for free vs having to buy them in Netflix, but between all the freaking digital distributors popping all the time and piracy, it doesn't work quite as well as yours.
---
can you reproduce the crash without arcdps also running?
---
i find it funny youre saying retarded is hate speech while also throwing around the word cunt like its nothing.
---
&gt;Hate speech is speech that attacks a person or a group on the basis of protected attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, national origin, **sex**, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
---
So dedication to the game is measured in the amount of different builds you use now?
---
The thing that bothered me the most was why I couldn't figure out how to link the traits and gear together. Then after playing with it for awhile it was like, "Oh... I actually have to manually switch both of them separately". I got too used to arcdps.
---
You are not at all representative of the general playerbase though. The only reason I wouldn't have cared about the monetization if I still played is because of raid selling, so I can buy 16k gems relatively quickly. But think about the people that truly play the game causally - an hour of farming Silverwastes is what, 25g? People sell their GoM for other TP barons to flip because they can't even afford the entry cost to craft a Gen1 legendary weapon. The average GW2 player does not have 1000s of gold to convert to gems. I'd bet the average liquid gold of the GW2 casual is less than 200g.
---
Also the functionality is trash compared to Arc, let's be honest. Auto-updating "feature" absolutely kills any sort of use case I would have for in-game templates in dungeons, and the limit of 6 builds is not enough for HC raiding / fractals. Count in players that play WvW and PvP as well, and you have an absolutely ridiculous lack of freedom with templates. This is not a case where you have a minority of haters, you have the vast majority of players calling bullshit where it is.
---
You can kind of compare this to the "no taxation without representation" slogan of the US lol. I'm sure most people wouldn't complain so much about the heavy monetization if they provided a functional product.
---
I found some infusions earlier but couldn't figure out where they are from. Turns out they where removed from my weapon but in the template system it showed that they where still in the weapon. Only when I removed the item I noticed they got removed. Agony didn't change either until I unequipted the weapon. Could be that the root problem to this is that it was made with monetization in mind. Trying to maximize profit. Instead of going for a simpler system they went for something too complex leading too all kinds of issue's.
---
That's true, but they don't really listen to the feedback, which is the real issue.
---
While I'm not a fan of the new loadouts this specific issue didn't change. You had to unequip gear before (and put it back in shared) and you still have to do that now, nothing changed for this specific case.
---
&gt; Anet managed to ban ARC Template
---
It wasnt banned, its temporary allowance just ran out
---
I already bought an extra slot.  I had the gems and I’m crazy happy to finally have template slots.  Got 8 toons, but only one of them needed an extra eq slot.  Loving it!
---
I mean, sure some people are toxic and shit, but I think it's a bit much to complain about paying for episodes when GW2 is already very generous with its offer.
---
Looks like one of the stained glass set, hrmm
---
It did for PVP weapons and armor only, as it generated said items for your character free of cost, but otherwise it's not the same as GW2.
---
Well it's true, but you never have too much bag space anyway
---
Are you kidding me? Are you guys 12 year-old?
---
The creative minds behing GW2 left. They didn't manage well the game but at least they put heart into it, with the screw ups and all.
---
GW2 is dead, GW2 Corporate is what lives.
---
That's about where I'm at. Every time there's a blunder everyone just forgets all the good things that have happened. I've spent a lot on this game, and only made a few mistakes with it where I bought something and promptly decided to change my character's aesthetics, which isn't their fault. But I agree, unless it's something crazy, I'm not gonna spend any more on it, as much as I want to until something happens.

The entire system is half assed. Typical of Assnet.

[removed]

Arc templates was always designed with the idea that when anet created an officially supported version,  it would cease functionality. The creator and much of the community knew it would cease to exist once real templates came out.

Haven't had the chance to properly explore build templates yet (at work rn). How do I create build links?

Oh, which season you think I must buy? I know that Season 4 has a lot of stuff, the others have too?

You know it’s not hard to link /u/wheadna’s actual [comment](/r/Guildwars2/comments/dosp0c/the_free_build_templates_are_just_the_pvp_and_wvw/f5pvkfc/)
---
It IS a bug. The solution is to simply tell the weapon to put the upgrades of the active loadout together (as they are dismantle when added to loadout) before removing it from the load out. The game remembers the upgrades as you can see in the equipment window so this should be an easy fix. (not a hot fix tho)
---
Nope... not really at all. The game would be just fine without whales. It would probably have a sub fee and get regular content instead of being free to play and the majority of anet's time being dedicated to finding new ways to bleed their players dry via the gemstore.
---
I am altering the deal, pray I don't alter it any further.

---
The system is really clunky. Really, really clunky.
---
Oh wow. They somehow managed to disappoint the already disappointed crowd even more.
---
Especially when you can try it for $1  for a month on Xbox Xbox game pass.
---
Can you give the exact sequence of events? Which tab were you making your build in? Which tab got overwritten? Did you enter PvP at any point before then?
---
humm.... We already knew about that?
---
"But they did. And that was how Arenanet ended as a company... by accidentally banning their entire playerbase and developers from gw2 for using notepad.
---
I'm Morgan Freeman. Titty sprinkles"
---
Genius
---
No problem! You deserve that!
---
If they do that, they also have to ensure that every single skill is put off of cd on each swap...which is ACTUALLY even worse.
---
There's really nothing wrong in the current implementation. It's a pre-cast. Pre-cast has been a thing since the dawn of GW2.
---
They usually run for 3 months and all you need to do to unlock the chapter is log onto any character on your account.  You don't have to play or anything, just log in and exit game.
---
When people asked for templates, we really wanted exactly what Arcdps provided to the players for years already (unlimited save slots of both armor, utility, and traits combined... which was similar to what was available in GW1 as well). 
---
I'm not even going to mention how bad the 2 'free' slots of equipment templates are, but, the real issue is when you save a build template in one of the slots at the top and save it, if you decide to tweek your build (for a specific situation or w/e reason) any change you do, automatically saves that as the new build. Anet needs to turn off this autosave for the build templates... OR IT'S NOT A REAL TEMPLATE IF YOU CAN INSTANTLY CHANGE IT WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO REVERT BACK TO WHAT IT WAS SAVED AS ORIGINALLY!
---
I feel like I'm in bizarro world. This is crazy, even for ANet.
---
I noticed this earlier today.
---
Put me in mind of r/softwaregore
---
"Thousands" over 7 years doesn't qualify as a "whale".
---
Just paying a standard monthly sub over that time is over $1000.
---
This would be a good solution if I didn't spend the last **several years** acquiring sets of legendary armor specifically to avoid the need for multiple character slots.
---
Wait so the way you're saying it works is:
---
You make a template that you want to have.
---
Then you want to test like 3 different setups or variations of it.
---
But when you test the first one that's automatically saved so there's no way to just quickly revert back tot he template and try the next idea?
---
Holy shit that is fucking dumb.
---
My main goal in this game was to get full legendary gear so I could test and play any build I wanted in raids, fractals and wvw but this update has pretty much ruined this for me. 
---
I already have two legendary sets of armour and three trinkets but now if I want to use them between characters I have to gut the template every time I swap making them useless. Not only this but having the equipment slots being so expensive also means for players that do need more than the two given slots it is cheaper to just buy character slots which again screws you over if you're using legendary gear.
---
I was optimistic for this update since I was hoping it would work how I always imagined it would but this system has so many downsides it just makes me want to stop playing. I love the gameplay in gw2 but this is such a hassle for a player like me it's not worth it. Hopefully they'll fix it over the coming months but I'm not optimistic anymore.
---
Some of the best games I’ve played were indie games I got for a few bucks on sale. Even if it’s not your new addiction, it shows Arenanet (and by extension, NCSoft) that we are the ones with a choice.
---
They are funding their safe and easy jobs. That's it. That's all there is to it. A few mounts and outfits here and there and they get to sit back and relax, providing no evolutions or resolutions to the game.
---
and only 2 equipment templates, because god forbid you have 3 roles such as a dps setup, condi setup, and a support setup on one character.
---
75% of people on this sub ignore megathreads sadly anyways. And they all mention the same complaints, but it's easier to make their own post thinking it's their idea than it is for them to find a similar thread. People feel like they're already too late to comment on threads and won't have their voice heard unless they create a new thread.
---
What he said was wrong.  "I don't care because PvP/WvW are *irrelevant to me* but he went one-step further and went with a smug, "Fuck you, I got mine" sort of response.  If you don't understand then I really don't know what to tell you.  Resorting to personal/character attacks is childish.
---
WTF? You have to pay for dlc???
---
&gt; That's what we call a boon pre-stack
---
Who is we? I am just assuming now that you mean arcdps template users, since i dont know any better.
---
I never used it, so how long did it usually take to swap a build with arcdps?
---
Because on 2nd thought, I wouldnt necessarily agree with OP anymore that this is actually a bug/exploit or at least unintended gameplay/feature.
---
Just wondering if boon pre-stack in (hardcore) raiding usually included all or some squad members swapping whole builds on the fly via arc templates before encounters and after stacking boons.
---
In wvw, before encounters, you would naturally also stack boons, guards doing empowers, players blasting fields etc. but then nobody (or most) players wouldnt swap to a completely different build set up, like a heal guard to a burn guard for example. Some good players on certain classes might switch out a couple of weapons but i doubt that anybody would start switching out more gear to different stats, change runes or traits after we buffed up.
---
But that may also be just because arcdps usage is way less common in wvw, so until now, most wvw players didnt really have the chance to switch a complete build in seconds.
---
But i could definately see this becoming a thing in wvw too, now that its possible without arcdps and I am not convinced that its entirely bad.
---
I general, if someone is able to play different builds efficiently, why shouldnt he be able to utilize it? 
---
But on the other hand, I can also see that it may not be the best idea in terms of combat balance in general because it enables us to make some pretty powerful build combos.
---
Apparently legendary sigils make it worse since you have to re-apply them if you manually change your equipped weapons (such as for a quick prestack).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dot7ua/build_templates_and_the_inconvenient_convenince/f5qupue/
---
&gt;The vast majority of data-mining posts didn't reveal anything too  incredible, and usually when they did that's on the part of Anet pushing  too much stuff into their live builds that shouldn't be there until the  content is actually released.
---
It's called "Agile" and "DevOps" principals. You push the code/scripts/etc when it is ready rather than once it's all done. The reasoning behind this is that the sooner you get changes out to staging and production environments and the smaller those changes are, the easier it is to identify potential problems and fix them.
---
Ever wonder why, despite bugs, ANet has only ever had to take GW2 down for maintenance one time? This is why. Fast feedback loops get information back to the developers faster and let them adjust long before players ever notice. Granted it also largely makes things like large release patterns (like Expansion) less viable while making things like Living World far more viable and realistic.
---
The exception to this rule are bugs that simply don't rear their ugly head until the feature/content is enabled and a flood of players use it. It is, to this day, still very difficult to replicate the kind of load you'll see in production. Sometimes even impossible. This is simply because users will always use software/games/etc in ways you can't account for until they do it.
---
Hmmm, I can see them banning people for using this, simply because it cuts into their revenue stream.
---
Just saying, because anet seems to be just as scummy as any other greedy triple A developer out there these days.
---
I don't trust them anymore, and once you lose my trust my wallet goes with it.
---
I mean what was that quote again? "I don't fear a man who has practiced 5,000 kicks one time, but rather I fear a man who has practiced 1 kick 5,000 times". There's something to be said about being really good with a build (or two) rather than following meta and not understanding your 3-6 builds.
---
That's what I'm saying. There arent that many amazing mmos here in the west. I like WoW, but I'm not going back to standing still to cast. I played black desert for a year and that game is cruel, not worth the headache. I've played tera, Blade and soul, and wild star. I always come back to gw2 for 2 reasons: 1) no gear treadmill, 2) no other game has a mesmer like class.
---
Jesus Christ, quit crying about your legendary items. Nobody cares.
---
&gt; This update is soooo great. Arenanet doesn't need any opponent to kill their game. They're doing this job on their own.
---
Pretty much what I'm thinking. I thought they would have kept the split between mode and just put the 3 builds we used for further reference, but removing the split between modes makes this feature so much worse. It's stupid. If we had the 3 per character PER mode (so 9 total) and unlocks were account wide, then it'd probably be fine, but the current iteration is SOOOO bad, it's impressive.
---
There is no "automatically saved."  There is no saving.  This has been clearly communicated since the reveal stream with nothing showing a save or load button anywhere and nobody seemed to catch it.  
---
It works exactly as it did before: if you changed your gear or build, you changed it; that's just what you were running now.  Now you just have more pages to switch between.  In the case of equipment, that means you have one "template" to "save" for later use by never changing anything on it, and the second one is a manually-swapped equipment page for changing and testing things.  
---
We got one template.
---
So you mean there is an actual hot topic in gw2? Yeah, shut it down, make room for art posts.
---
Lmfao you deserve gold for that one
---
Gotcha, makes sense. Hopefully they fix that =/
---
This post should be higher and I was about to make a similar one. I main chrono and the only solution I found is simply not equipping any weapons in the second weapon set of template 2. Since I pretty much use sword and shield all the time, those work fine, but the game constantly unequips sigils and infusions. And this doesn't only happen for my sword offhand, but even for the focus, that isn't even part of any build template... All in all, reusing legendaries in multiple templates is terribly implemented
---
When I went intp SPVP it overwrote my Template 1 build with my PVP build and it stayed that way when I went back into PVE. I haven't gone into the PVP Lobby since.
---
Source?
---
Ok so thats just...bad and not even what they are trying to call it.
---
They made a bad poorly thought out feature and then tried to pass it off with name and marketing as something people wanted. Yet its nothing like people actually want and just lacks basic functionality for a system to even remotely work the way people would actually use it.
---
How does the first game have a more functional version of this system than one thats being monetized.
---
id rather the sub be filled with complaints than shitty art posts and "i love anet!" threads. at least the complaints could lead to something useful.
---
And you're entitled to your opinion. Just as I'm entitled to mine.
---
sorry hun this was a poor analogy since new characters created in existing slots cost exactly the same no matter where you use them. there is no Lamborghini in your example
---
This engine is badly optimized, no amount of high spec hardware is going to allow you to run this game at 60fps all the time. The range you have now 45-60 is what most people get. You could run a 2080ti and still not reach a stable 60fps. There are exceptions here and there, if you tweak it a bit but with your hardware that is the best you gonna get.
---
Liar. This gaming community is full of sexists and racists. And of course you are their whore. Should I point out the obvious truth to slap your face again? You love what the misogynists have been doing just because you are a jealous bitch who hate other women like crazy. Keep crying to the mods and prove my point.
---
Maybe because a few other games require you to wait until a certain point in level or story where you unlock the ability to swap between builds.
---
"shitty art posts" okay
---
Oh FFS. I forgot about that. He's not even wearing a bathrobe. He's fighting in panties and a pushup bra.
---
Mine isnt an opinion, its a terrible design decision that encourages players who are competent or have invested years into the game to just leave. Which given the future the game is heading to after the pax announcement i have to agree with. Lol more people should leave for better games
---
That's insane. I don't know how much the concessions are at my theater, but my partner and I usually get our tickets, food, and drink for a $20 bill.
---
Yeah, like when they gave us free bag slots, bank slots and collection expansions.
---
Alright, i didn't know they gave exp, how do I unlock the crafting section? I thought it would unlock like the rest as i got to a higher level, but I'm already 50+ and it's not yet unlocked
---
Black lion chest, daily chest (I think), Trading Post, pvp rewards, birthday rewards, quest I think. It may be helpful to Google crafting boosts in GW2. I just don't remember how to get them.
---
Yea, I tried out 3 other classes before ranger and i think I'm sticking with this for now..
---
Thanks for the link, I'll check it out
---
What's the point of having fun and enjoying yourself in the way that you want? Let me think about that?
---
This game was designed for a certain type of player. It didn't have raids when it launched. Orr was too hard and nerfed. You may not like it, but that's the audience. I don't actually care whether you stay or leave, because it won't affect my game at all. 
---
I'm sorry you don't like what I enjoy or how I play but since all you want to do is insult it, I'm done talking to you. Hope you find a game you like.
---
yeah. i've got nearly 80 myself, but other family members don't have nearly so many. i never have used them, so i'm surprised to hear this, but it makes sense.
---
Would be nice on my guardian too if I could use the DH bow.
---
DPS on it is absolute crap.
---
Ok, thanks
---
I wish the equipment templates are not auto saved by default so we can make minor changes and revert back to the equipment/gears we want by right click the tab and load or using a keybind to load it. Would this then be a solution to this legendary gears problems?
---
EA is most definitely what ArenaNet/NCSoft are aspiring to be, though. Come back in a year or two and just see how much worse it will truly get.
---
Made a build in tab 1 in Lion's Arch. Went to PvP lobby. PvP build is now showing in tab 1, rather than the build I put in there in Lions Arch. Return to Lion's arch. PvP build is still showing in tab 1. Other build is gone.
---
No worries. Goodluck and welcome to Guild Wars 2!
---
Damn, I had no idea, alright I'll check it out
---
Its Guild Wars content so why wouldn't it belong here? Just confused why people hate art posts if it's still guild wars content. Original content at that. That someone likely worked hours to make
---
This is truly embarrassing. They deserve to be flamed for this alone. And they want to monetize this garbage? Fuck that.
---
thanks

geez not this sub too, yall need to chill🦀🦀🦀

It's the only part of the outfit I like!

Creating a megathread would require having mods that give a damn. Just like Anet the mods here don't care about anything, if they event exist.
---
At least it’s something for the more casual players, and let’s be real, Anet has always catered to the casuals.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_text_editors
---
And none of them should be forgiven because that's just what companies do.  Just because objectionable business practices are the norm doesn't make them acceptable or justified.
---
They were, but Legendary weapons existed long before then and didn't have any of that functionality.  See where I said "People still went for Legendary weapons anyway".
---
Poor PvP and WvW. :(
---
And I mean that seriously, I don't want that to come off as sarcastic.
---
While I understood the complaints, I didn't agree with them because Anet is giving us something (if it's such a problem, just keep doing what you were doing before).  But Taking away those slots from PvP and WvW, that's just ridiculously bad.  That's unacceptable no matter what.
---
Well, you generalised saying "Legendary gear" which includes Legendary armors. Learn to phrase and get your facts together.
---
Thanks man, do u still play?
---
Just decided to stop playing for now after my Queensdale maps crashed to login screen 5 times in 10 minutes. Everyone in the map crashed and when we reconnected we were all at the starting WP rather than where we were before the crash.

Then I come here and see this. Yup, it crashes whole open world maps, too.
---
So, I'm all for talking about this being a free upgrade to the un-modded game, but this isn't the place for that. This is a thread about a real actual objective UX downgrade relative to before the feature was launched, so let's keep the mtx discussion in more appropriate threads.

gw2 completely ruins mmorpg games because nothing else is going to come close. im trying monster hunter, ff14 but the rutt im stuck in is so hadd tk get out of
---
Yeah going ahead and removing this because I agree with the reports and comments that 2 may be a massive and insane exploit if it really is that insane.
---
Please everyone email exploits@arena.net with this and we will do our best to let them know as well.
---
That's until you reach cap :P
---
I feel like having copyable equipment template links would really make this feature shine.
---
Remember to use the official retailers, [&gt;&gt;list here&lt;&lt;](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/), to prevent any complications when buying the game. ArenaNet cannot help you with unauthorized sellers and using fraudulent keys can lead to account being suspended.

---
Don’t be silly. That looks like a well implemented system.
---
I thought they had said PvP and Wvw would have a separate system for builds and would come later?
---
Gear will still be swapped automatically, but before your 6-0 skills and traits would also auto swap.  Now they do not.  It's currently impossible to make equipment templates in PvP.
---
What does usage rate have to do with anything? 
---
Of course ArcDPS will be/has been used less then the built-in template system. That fact alone doesn't doesn't make it better or worse lol.
---
And honestly dude, how tech un-savvy do you think the average MMORPG player is lmao where they can't handle like a 2 step install tutorial lmao. 
---
Like, I kinda see what you're coming from but it's like you're missing the issue with these new templates.
---
Grrrrrr I am not doing this with all of my toons. This is stupid. Logged in Went into WvW. Nothing but PvE build. I have like 10 characters. I am not resetting all the skills and gear and stuff. Does it do this every damn time you log in? WTF. Just 100% stuck a stake through what little will I had left to play.
---
Here's a [screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/RELWKFy)...
---
To clarify, if you play pve, pvp, and wvw content all on one character, arenanet’s implementation of build templates is strictly worse than what you had before unless you pay money. 
---
Before, your build automatically changed when you entered a wvw map to whatever build you were last in wvw with. 
---
Now, the three “build template slots” you had before, one for pve, pvp, and wvw, you have three slots which you manually have to change.
---
Instead of being a poor man, if you could make a video of you spending a minimum of $326.25 USD on build templates, maybe I'd be triggered. Try it out. See if it works.
---
🦀this isn't rs🦀
---
Same. Been playing WvW exclusively for like 6 years and I feel so wore down by the constant neglect of the game mode in general. This whole mess of build 'templates' is the last mail to the coffin.
---
why MotD when a notepad on your OS does the same. o.O?
---
A large number of players play WvW or PvP in supplement to their PvE, even casually.
---
Revenant utility order was something specifically mentioned in the recent episode of Guild Chat as being preserved, so this is likely a bug and not intended behaviour.
---
Holy shit lol
---
Thanks Man, that clarification really helped me, I was confused because when I looked on the game Wiki about the Season 4, they showed many dates from different years, and I thought that It was possible to the episodes come back for free.
---
AAU is really fun but it's got plenty if problems too right now. The game was balanced around pay to win in the original, so now that they've removed all the p2w stuff, the balance and mechanics are wacky. They do seem willing to fix issues though so we will see.
---
Make that 3 regurgitated armor boxes - got one just now during the EVOS run. Here's hoping that rngesus blesses you with those good good boxes and gross but unique skins soon, friend!
---
They removed the automatic part of it. 
---
i.e. some feature was removed. 
---
It’s annoying that Anet did this
---
Well, I expected the gold to gem rate would skyrocket, but last I checked, it hasn't.  That seems to indicate most are not buying, at least with gold.
---
Oh yeah, completely forgot about that one, have it installed ready for this weekend :D
---
Not all that many.
---
Oh I used that hop to jump on sky scale off water with slimmer I’ll have to test if I can’t anymore that’d be sad
---
Who actually designs for GW2..... I mean who actually thinks that's a great idea.
---
With this method you can keep your guild up to date with build changes.
---
Ummmm... what?
---
Perhaps you aren't paying attention. Moving legendary gear in and out of the equipment loadouts (Note: they are loadouts NOT templates) has a tendency to spill upgrades everywhere. That is what the OP is ranting about regarding PvP. Upgrades spill out when swapping gear, but because PvP doesn't use those upgrades, they can't put them back in their equipment.
---
I don't know what world in which that is objectively better than before.
---
Yeah, I just use it to change one skill in my build.
---
Could this feature have been 100% free? Yes
---
Is the community blowing this completely out of proportion? Also yes.
---
In the end of the day, I hate to defend game companies... but this is a free of subscription MMO.
---
Not only that, but in terms and comparison to other MMO's in the same field, not a single one even when compared to paid subscription titles  comes close to the standards and quality GW2 has.
---
It's free subscription, what honestly do you expect? Not only that but you can earn everything in game!!! That's fucking rare to find any game willing to exchange in game currency for premium currency!!!
---
Seriously, why is everyone scraping the bottom of the barrel of complaints when other pressing issues like PvP and WvW class imbalances and no significant updates to those game modes in literal years are far more pressing.
---
Are any pieces shared between them? Because the dye is attached to the item and not the equipment slot.  Using an item across multiple gear layouts will use the last dye color across all
---
1) you need to manually swap builds when entering pvp/wvw, it doesn't do it automatically now...
---
2) transferring equipment is now a hastle, since everything is in a loadout, you need to move it to the inventory first then bank/shared slots
---
3) the interaction with runes/sigils/infusions is a mess, just read some of the posts
---
4) legendary gear is devalued because of the limited slots (even if you foolishly buy all of the slots, 6 is not enough when the whole point of it is to be able to swap stats on 1-2 pieces to accomodate for buffs)
---
5) it is not actually a template, but a loadout, if you make minor tweaks, to try something out, it changes the preset, you can't just press "allocated hotkey for set 1" to go back to your cookie cutter build...
---
Don't try to convince yourself that anet had QoL as their #1 priority when designing it. And thanks to that we got a clunky overpriced feature, that spits in the face of quite a lot of players
---
The only moderately useful thing that came out of this shit show is that you can pre-stack with max concentration gear before pulls... awesome.
---
Well, if you see the second screenshot, you can apply a build directly to one of your build slots by right clicking the build link. A lot less cumbersome than a notepad imo, but you can do whatever works for you =3
---
That's not really what the firings suggest. ANet was shifting away from GW2 - they weren't branching out, they were leaving a skeleton crew on GW2 to do other stuff. ANet created projects and diverted resources - most of their resources, too - into those projects, all while completely failing to announce, market, or release anything.
---
Their management was throwing money into the ether and leaving their profitable venture - *which happens to be NCSoft's only real presence in the entire western market* - to rot. 
---
I'm honestly surprised NCSoft didn't step in sooner, because ANet's performance, player reception, wasted projects, abandoned successes, and the complete collapse of their attempts at community management were putting out red flags for bad company management for years.
---
It was always faster to switch your ascended gear out than having to manually change all of your legendary gear and runes to something else. 
---
That has not changed
---
The difference now is that the game does it even faster than before. 
---
Keep in mind that Arc Templates were better because it made legendary swapping almost as fast as Ascended swapping and it made getting legendary gear worth it.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
lol so true
---
Only thing I'm buying is mount skins (what? I like having a 4 slot dye instead of 1)
---
Are you on USA server? I'll join. I just haven't been doing raids because of time restraints
---
It did something similar when i had to swap between two light classes for WvW. When i tried to put the legendary armor in the bank, a message popped up asking if i was sure i wanted to remove this from the storage. Obviously yes, and then i found my legendary runes and infusions were all removed from the gear. I honestly cannot understand how you fuck this up this royally. I would rather spend gems to just turn this feature off, account wide.
---
That’s the thing. That’s what a template is. What Anet gave us are—by definition—not templates. They’re simply build load-outs. If they actually gave us fucking templates that’d be one thing. But nope. More monetized ‘fuck-you’s to the players.
---
Sort of - the memory that would be used for the sign (usually the leading bit) in a signed integer is used as an extra value bit in an unsigned integer.
---
For example:
---
signed:
---
    1 1 1 1
---
    | data bits
---
    sign bit
---
4 bits have 2^4 possible combinations, but the actual value of the number only has 3 bits to use if one of the 4 bits is the sign. The range of 4-bit signed integers is therefore -8 to 7. It's -8 because 8 in binary is 1000, which sets the sign bit (1 means negative). It can't be -0, so it's -8.
---
unsigned:
---
    all data bits
---
Instead of looping back around into negatives, an unsigned integer can display 1000 as 8, and continue up to 1111 as 15. Its range is therefore 0 to 15. When an unsigned integer goes into negatives, it loops back around to its maximum. As strange as it might sound, for 4-bit unsigned integers, 0-1, or 0000 - 0001, works out to 1111 which, to it, is 15.
---
As a general rule for integers, an *n*-bit signed integer has a range of -2^(*n*-1) to 2^(*n*-1)-1, whereas the same number of bits for an *n*-bit unsigned integer yields a range of 0 to 2^(*n*-1),  with a maximum that is exactly 1 more than 2 times the maximum of the signed integer with the same number of bits - exactly what OP's screenshot shows in the context of unsigned 32-bit integers.
---
I've gone from "Oh maybe that'll make things easier and increase my interest to come back to the game" to "Well, I guess that game is officially dead to me and I should stay over here on AAU".
---
It also bug out the colors of my armor, on the dye tab the colors are correct, but on game display they became the one on the second template, since I don't own the warbeast dye set I hope it reverts by itself...
---
Warhammer Online: The official game is shut down, but there is a fan server that has been running for over 5 years now. It has better balance than the live game had and completely free (you can't even donate any money in order to not draw any unwanted attention from gamesworkshop), so it's absolutely not incentivized by profit, purely a passion project.
---
The graphics is outdated, but has limited fashion wars and the wvw (rvr) mode is actually better than what GW2 has.
---
*in a deep voice* **"It's in the gem store"**
---
You know, I quit this game a little while ago and I keep checking the Reddit to see if it gets better, it just becomes more and more of a shitshow.
---
Anet are trying to copy Bethesda, it seems
---
I guess you can keybind... all three slots! That’s convenient. Chat codes are nifty I guess. You do realize you have to log out and patch for updates? That’s no different than patching for the templates except you go to a website, copy and paste... I guess that’s a lot of work /shrug.
---
Also, I find it hilarious that people said Arc had so many issues, like it was breaking their game, causing crashes and issues, some even claimed it “stole their item”... and yet none of that is true.
---
Yet Anet releases their official update and what happens? It crashes people’s games, it overwrite builds, it breaks legendary functionality, it supposedly stole someone’s items, it’s causing a bug allowing people to duplicate infusions... among other stuff.
---
Like you can’t make this stuff up... it’s hilarious to me.
---
I had absolutely no need for build templates as an altoholic and the update took away what I'd always appreciated - the automatic build swap upon entering WvW. Thanks for a few free bag slots I suppose?
---
This game is absolutely the friendliest MMO. When toxic people come in, people ban them. I personally am a frequent commander and mentor and it’s so rewarding helping new players! Glad to have you in our community
---
That’s unfortunate... they should have fired Mike Z and other failures of so-called management instead of the 144+ most likely very talented employees. New management with a solid and creative team would have made this company so much better. 
---
Seems that those that should be held liable never are.
---
you do realize you re simply adjusting whatever data you d like to be true to the argument you made.
---
it s supposed to work the other way around
---
Same for me on ember bay. Some trolls where doing it on purpose. I don't get why this is not upvoted more
---
You're well past that with this feature, you're better off asking for ostomy bags.
---
Well actually u getting 1 slot for free. Only builds were stored between game modes, not equipment
---
Thanks you for this nice idea
---
Lol, you're supposed to read it and discuss the points.
---
You can remove it only 800 gems
---
What the fuck.
---
You didn't lose them, you can now apply them freely to whatever gamemode you want, AND got gear templates and storage on top of it.
---
Kind of. Ish. It just requires some serious programming time properly implementing threading and upgrading to DX12 and they've not been sufficiently motivated to do that.
---
Sometimes, science is indistinguishable from magic.
---
Wierd bug did not happend to me.
---
You do realize you begin with 0 slots. Prior to this release you had a PvE template, a PvP template, and a WvW template. They took those away from you and gave them back to you as “Free” slots.
---
If you actually want additional slots you have to buy 3. And that’s it. You want to buy another 3 or have 5-10 builds? Sorry tough luck cause you are capped at 3.
---
So not only do you have to pay to get more than what you started with but ultimately you end up with much less than you previously had access to (unlimited for free with a single click in one simple format).
---
On top of that Anet’s official templates are causing way more issues, like literally crashing peoples games and stuff. 
---
And no, this is a big issue not because templates are a necessity but because it sets a precedent for Anet to start charging for EVERYTHING in ludicrous ways. The more people buy into these horrible cash grabs the worse the monetization gets... and it’s steadily getting worse.
---
So, yes ultimately this is a bigger issue.
---
This game is nose diving into the trash bin.
---
Even the most the most diplomatic people have a break down point
---
But that's the thing. People are asking for content they need to pay for. They are asking for expansions that you need to buy but in return, you also get more content at once unlike with LW episodes.
---
And Arena Net turns around and is like "No, we don't want you to spend money on content! Better spend it on this optional feature thingy!"
---
This is not how you maintain an MMO as big as GW2. We need to talk about the business perspective of GW2 because without that, you won't have a game to play for free in some years down the line. (Not saying GW2 will die or is already dead. But you can keep old and new players only so long before they get bored of the lack of new things to do.)
---
We, as consumer, need to pay one way or another. There is no true F2P when we talk about MMO's. They need money to further develop and keep everything up and running. GW2's Item Shop is not as intrusive as similar shops in other games. I agree with you 100% on that one. But as you also said, it's optional. There are many people out there never spending any money. Or only a one time payment for PoF. This all happens at the same time as half of the community cries for new content to play. For new expansions. For anything. But nope, better buy this new gem store outfit!
---
This is not working in long term. Arena Net had a good system in place with LW and Expansion. Now that we (again) only have LW, I am not only a bit concerned about the future of this game.
---
By the way, I also don't believe that Arena Net couldn't push out more content even if they try. The core team of FFXIV is roughly the same size, I think even a bit smaller, and they manage it perfectly well. With the added problem that there are not much experienced MMO developer on the asian market because everyone is specializing in the much bigger mobile market. And they can't really "import" new workforce because the company language is Japanese. So statistically, the FFXIV team is getting smaller and smaller over time. By now I need to assume, that Arena Net doesn't want to give us what we need.
---
what also doesnt work: if you use the same weapon in multiple gear loadouts and want to swap on the fly (during a dungeon run) you equip the new weapon but the old one doesnt go back in your inventory because its also part of another loadout. therefore you have to open your hero menue and move it back to your inventory or dont use the same weapon for multiple loadouts
---
Can I have your materials?
---
The [Mumble API](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/API:MumbleLink) would like to have a word with you.
---
That and That\_Shaman tends to not spoil the story
---
sPvP equip will have its own thing. Templates for traits and such are shared tho
---
Up
---
I will not pay a DIME for this bs
---
It's more akin to equipment loadouts from like Diablo games than templates.
---
thankfully windowed fullscreen exist and its even faster if you tab between the game and your browser
---
Super unsurprising, but still infuriating considering they never 100% fixed the previous bugs related to legend swapping and utility skill order. There are still certain scenarios where re-ordering will occur that haven’t been dealt with simply because it doesn’t happen often. Revenant utility code needs a serious rework
---
Is that the first time you had ever entered PvP since the patch?
---
Added some touches to it..  https://i.imgur.com/rCwYRIQ.gifv  :D
---
That's why i keep calling Arenanet's developers a bunch of INCOMPETENT CLOWNS. I have come to terms that most suggestions been proposed since day one (like a cleaner boon/condition UI etc) aren't in the game because the CAN'T do it.
---
I wasn't aware that my credibility needed any support. It's doing just fine on its own.
---
Between this and the awful new UI for switching legendary stats EAnet clearly needs to find better UI dessigners.
---
they werent allowed to touch inventory code which would be needed for arclike templates
---
Some say it represents the soul that's left in anet.
---
For aesthetics as you said, just for this. As I did for Nevermore.
---
Anet hasn't been listening to player feedback for quite some time.
---
The Story is a good analogy, it can apply here. But many People don't care and are saying "Better than nothing" sadly. 
---
Despite this, it's like saying "I won't vote, cause everyone is voting for Party xxx anyways". Do not buy templates if you are against it, thus vote with your wallet. Not buying them is like voting just anything else to make Party xxx not as big. 
---
Build templates are a joke, almost an Insult. The free templates are only free for those who Play one exclusive game mode. And it's still a loss compared to Arc
---
That's not how you develop anything. The portion of the community that would provide feedback only makes up a fraction of the overall player base and may not be at all representative of how your general player base interacts with the game.
---
Also, it's difficult to gather legitimate feedback that would result in healthy changes when virtually every player is biased towards their own interest and only considers the game on the micro level they play in.
---
To properly add a post launch feature you gather player data and shoot for a baseline that would have the largest impact. In this case,  I am sure Anet collected telemetry on how often people change traits, how often they change gear loadouts and how much extra gear they carry around. Based on what dropped I'd say they found the average to be three trait changes (likely one for vanilla and then each specialization), and two sets of gear.
---
If you want a recent example of this, Blizzard added Brigitte to Overwatch after their reddit and forum communities harassed them for months for a character to counter the prevalent dive meta. She was essentially exactly what players were asking for. The result of that ended up being balance patch after balance patch, character reworks, and the start of a much staler meta that lasted longer than dive and had a massive negative impact on the game. The director even admitted later that the character was a response to player demands and was a mistake.
---
You never trust players. You trust data. A player speaks for themselves, data speaks most of the players.
---
What's curious is that her lack of shwoing for Bound By Blood is never actually addressed. There's one line where Braham accidentally calls Ryland "Rox", but other than that the closest we get is:
---
&gt;**&lt;Character name&gt;:** This is all of us? Bangar invited the whole Pact, didn't he?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;**Rytlock Brimstone:** Kas and Jory are on the way. Otherwise...  
---
&gt;**Gorrik:** [Taimi](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Taimi)'s working on her treatise. "The Elder Dragons Reconsidered." She insisted I should go...live a little.  
---
&gt;**Gorrik:** To be clear: I'm attending only for the chance to study the local fauna. I will not be participating in any revelry.  
---
&gt;**Braham Eirsson:** Hey, my invite promised a party so legendary we'd be remembered in song without even having to die.  
---
&gt;**Marjory Delaqua:** How do you say no to that? 
---
Which sounds like they were trying to avoid talking about Rox.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
So ArenaNet could technically pull a "here's Rox again" but there was enough not-so-subtle dialogue in Episodes 5 and 6 to imply she was leaving Dragon's Watch and joining the Olmakhan.
---
Then they should just let Delta or any modder to rez Arc templates, because their system sucks shit.
---
Never play on patch day
---
So, are these templates Anet is adding the kind where, at the click of a button or two, your skills and gear switch between presets? Or are they just meant to show someone who what your build is?
---
Gotta talk to a crafting NPC in any major city :)
---
I played 76 during the free week after e3, and yeah it wasn't as bad anymore. I meant more in the sense of the recent sub drama - prioritizing barely-working cash grabs over quality content.
---
Also Borderlands 2 is a complete slog without any real build for more than half of the campaign. Leveling speed is so slow, you will only get the last point in ONE tree close to the end of the campaign. Nevermind making a mixed build, that's reserved for running the game over and over again in New Game plus and shit like that.
---
Maybe it's just me but im really liking this feature.
---
I keep it at my alt+F4
---
I somehow missed this on monday, so I had to dig through a bunch of build template drama to find this thread. And now I've read it, and I feel better despite the sad comic.
---
I hope they don't leave Rox written off for good, wherever she went to during Bound by Blood. It would be such a half-assed way to send her off, without a proper goodbye from her to either the Commander or Braham.
---
Honestly I’ve been having this as well. Like a lot of people I’ve been playing this game since launch with plenty of breaks, and I’ve seen SO MANY ArenaNet game’s-on-fire bullshit happenings. New player experience, canning Dungeons, ALL OF HOT ^sans ^raids, cancelling legendaries only to drip feed them (we still haven’t got a full second set lol)... that’s not even a comprehensive list, that’s just some of the first that come to mind.
---
This is CONSTANT with them. They can’t communicate, put out content at a reasonable pace, or make the content actually rewarding. They can’t make absolutely basic changes to how things work, they always have to reinvent the wheel and 99% of the time it comes out god awful. Above all, they have an almost comical stance on monetization: the only reason every single thing doesn’t nickel and dime you as a consumer is they’d finally drive off the last bit of their players (and they still try it).
---
Half the people who cared got canned over the winter. The other half have been leaving if they have the chance to do so (big F to the folks stuck at ANet who see the writing on the walls). The folks still there don’t care and-or don’t want to be there- and frankly that’s depressing as FUCK because I’ve known people who work ground floor at ANet. Their teams by and large were super passionate about their projects even if they were janky. Most of the dumb shit that happened was because of bad management outside their control. These days though I can’t blame anyone for not caring- if your management was so fixated on trying to milk players for money while producing as little content as possible, *how could you care*?
---
I don’t know where I’m going with this, man, but I’m so pissed off and sad. I don’t think I’ll uninstall because I run a lot of stuff for my guild including Guild Missions, but I definitely don’t see myself playing outside of obligations unless things change. It fucking sucks watching ANet shoot themselves (and usually us) in the foot, make a vague promise about how they won’t shoot us in the foot again and then doing it anyways 9 months later when they give birth to their next misgotten brainchild.
---
Yes, they said "please buy more gems"
---
Enjoy having them autoremove sigils/runes/stats anytime you need to swap them in and out now
---
Yeah well that's exactly how societies work. Only some actually take action and/or speak in the public. Doesn't mean anything is wrong with that or that it isn't representative.
---
How do you get the links for builds templates?
---
yeah, imagine people posting their opinions on a public forum.
---
I hope it's just a way too anticipated release that still need to be worked on, because otherwise this "QoL update" is litterally the opposite for WvW and PvP players.
---
And i hope Anet is not simply thinking about their PvE players like they usually do.
---
Be a decent dad and blur his face for privacy.
---
you could even set those up as macros
---
I recommend going back to GW1.
---
I don't think that 10 percent is representative at all, though. Yes people are upset, but there are many of us who aren't at all. Once they iron out the few bugs (of which I have not personally experienced any so I cannot speak on them but don't discount them), and perhaps look into the weird interaction with legendary gear it will be a great addition to the game.
---
So you made legendary pvp armor too? Like I and a lot of others did...
---
Not for skin I already have, for stat swap 100% yes.. thanks anet. (Maybe some lube next time?)
---
Here's the math per character breakdown for those that are wondering: 
---
Equipment Templates: $6.25 each, $25 total
---
Build Templates: $3.75 each, $11.25 total
---
Build Storage (Account): $37.50
---
So, we have the one time Account-wide purchase of $37.50, then a total of $36.25 per character afterward.
---
This is true, but tragic. Some of the best memories of raiding in Wow and other games were those raid "progression" nights where we wiped night after night, trying to figure out and coordinate our strategies on some of the really hard bosses. It would sometimes take many weeks to clear it, but the intense feeling of accomplishment and camaraderie we felt after beating it was something I've never forgotten.

Just should create a dedicated Reddit for people complaining on templates. So that it doesn't pollute the main Reddit...
---
I had no opinion on this feature either way until now. I now have an opinion.
---
Dx12 and threading fixes will only address the client.  The lag in WvW comes from the server when it tries to calculate every spell effect, every condition, every proc, every boon, every multiplier, etc for a 50 vs 50 vs 50 blob fight.  The server can't keep up, not the client.
---
Precasting has been a thing since release lol
---
Buy gems with gold, its not that hard
---
oof
---
I've joined this game quite recently, after years of playing subscription MMORPGs. I do enjoy PVE, PVP and WwW and I fail to see any significant benefits of this badly planned implementation. I've already spent more money getting bag space and other basic need items than playing Wow for a year. I honestly think this community is being ripped off on every possible occasion and it just hurts to see it being done like that, with zero acknowledgement of any feedback given over the last months. Anet's attitude more than anything spoils the fun of playing for me. People accepting 'the new reality' may be forgetting who was this game made for.
---
none. i can't believe that 7 years later gw2 is still the best mmorpg. ff14 is starting to look promising for pve though.
---
probably missed the last update but wow it looks so clean and nice ! :) Great work!
---
Maybe it's just too early for me but as far as I know anet didn't profit from his conversion. They only profit from buying gems. Correct me if I'm wrong tho
---
Don't know what dtto means, but what is the purpose of post like this one of our is not to find other players to share in-game belongings before leaving the game?
---
80% Crit Chance from gear / traits is too much, since you gain a lot through buffs like Spotter, banners and food
---
Buying build templates is a guaranteed way to make your most dedicated players achieve a feeling of pride and accomplishment.
---
Honestly I don't know. Maybe I would just grab my guitar more often, return to writing stories and occasionaly play Minecraft.
---
Guild Wars 2 is perfect for me. I played some MMORPGs, they were always:
---
* Grindy
---
* With poor endgame
---
* Boring
---
* Extremly P2W
---
* Subscription based (I prefer "pay to play")
---
* Dead
---
STWOR was very good, I enjoyed the story, but the game had very boring combat system.
---
Dragon's Prophet had poor endgame (at least in times I played in it) based only on dungeons.
---
Metin2 died. + Very grindy and P2W. tbh I would enjoy Metin2 more, but whole game was one huge RNG. Luck or you lost everything you have.
---
Tibia is dead. Grindy and P2W.
---
Path of Exile — it was my first "hack &amp; slash" game and unfortunately I don't like these games.
---
Neverwinter Dungeon&amp;Dragons: boring.
---
What about trying other games?
---
BDO is grindy.
---
WoW is ugly and there is no combat like in GW2.
---
ESO — something's keeping me away from Skyrim. I just don't want to try it.
---
FFXIV — I don't even know what it is.
---
I am not arguing one way or another but I am pretty sure that A/Net have had to balance out the losses from selling character slots with the build templates. For example, I have 2 necros, one for WvW and the other for PVE. In theory, A/Net would lose that sale because of build templates, depending on how they charged for build templates.
---
I would also like a permanent "full" account wide unlock as an option. Not that I would use it but just because I prefer account wide things.
---
theyre salty as its less better than arcdps
---
You're kidding, right?
---
Yeah God forbid problems get highlighted.
---
how do i know that?
---
whelp, back to crafting daily Ascended mats!
---
ty
---
&gt; GW2 is dead, GW2 Corporate is what lives.
---
It would appear that Zhaitan won after all, then.
---
And you pay a monthly sub. How many build templates could you buy over the course of 2 years of subs?
---
Is there any major MMO developer, besides perhaps Square, that isn't complete shit these days?
---
Wow. Thank you for your work on this!
---
The complaints were mainly about anet removing a lot of qol stuff through their implementation of templates. As a semi new or casual player, it won’t affect you as much so don’t worry.
---
You should have unlocked the lw stories regardless if you had expansions. They’ll be ready to play once you but the expansion.
---
The expansions are pretty cheap right now either way. You get hot for free by buying PoF. But if you’re willing to wait, there may be a sale.
---
Issues with the system /= removal of anything. Nuanced, I know. But it's real.
---
1. There is two kind of damage types in the game: Power and condition damage. Your longbow does power damage. By increasing your power stat you will increase your overall non-condition damage. 
---
2. There is modifiers in traits that further increase your damage. As example there is a trait that increase your power damage if you land a cc. Sigils and runes gives modifiers. 
---
 3. Power damage has ability to crit. You have to invest both precision and ferocity to get maximum effect from critical hits. Condition damage cannot crit.
---
4. Try any major cities and starting maps.
---
&gt;less better
---
do you mean worse?
---
protip: don't be a fucking idiot
---
this... this is perfect
---
I'd say the templates fell of the table too many times and it caused this abomination to be born.
---
I would rather pay a monthly subscription if that means that monetization isn't being factored into design decision. Or if it means getting functional features without having to pay extra for them. Or if it means getting steady content at a defined pace instead of trying to reinvent the wheel every year to squeeze out more money. 
---
Frankly I *welcome* the subscription.
---
These Chucky dolls are getting to real.
---
It's not a problem for them since people will still buy it and that is all they care about.
---
above less than gooder
---
i see
---
While I do not agree with the pricing ideas, Anet has to earn money somehow. Naturally such QoL improvements will cost money. I'd be happier if this game as paid subscription based and Gemstore stuff was indeed purely cosmetic (or no Gemstore at all), but players these days do not like subscriptions. So this is what we get. 
---
Why do I actually like the implementation? I can finally switch my builds and equipment each with a single key. We even gained additional inventory space.
---
Why would you btw? I'm honestly confused what purpose that storage serves? As someone who roleplays I can understand people having a few characters of each profession but why would you run exactly the same build on them all?
---
Providing educational work in media competence is not my definition in beeing an fucking idiot.
---
Exactly. I switched MMO's (to be fair it wasn't due to build templates, but I'd be lying if I said it wasn't at least one factor)
---
Love his face &gt;:D
---
You could buy every Equipment and Build template and every build storage and be a little under 2 years.
---
Right now your are sitting on 1500 Gems for Equipment Templates, 900 Gems for the Build Templates and 3500 Gems for the Build Storage.
---
You already need 75€ to max out your first character.
---
After this you will have 400 Gems left.
---
To get 6 Equipment Templates and 6 Build Templates on the remaining 8 classes you will have to pay 12000 Gems for the equipment and 7200 gems for the builds, totaling at 19200 Gems.
---
You will have to buy the 8k Pack 2x and the 2800 Pack once. Remember that have 400 Gems left. This will get you to 19200 Gems at the cost of 310€.
---
You would be able to play a game with a 15€ sub for a little over 20 months.
---
I'm doing raids only with PUGs... as a PUG. Everyone's linking requirements (LIs and KPs).
---
I don't want to sit on discord or other communicator, listening to someone's complaining, screaming or other unnecessary things. I don't need to be guided. I know mechanics, I know my class, I know what to do and when to do. + I don't have a mic.
---
They will buy it when arc will stop working, and even then, you get 1900gems worth slots with new character, and they are on promotions too
---
After PoF was also the same time that they started to really move resources over to their other projects, which they never communicated about and tried to pretend as though GW2 still had the same amount of hands on it.
---
Really feels like after PoF they were basically done with GW2 and ready to move on. Then shit got canned, people were laid off, and now a big chunk of the game's legacy devs left to start a new studio. The game's basically running on fumes at this point.
---
I luled hard
---
Just sad that the MMO genre is dying out in favor of easy barebones cashcrap mobile games filled with manipulating microtransactions  to the max.
---
Or how about don't buy anything to support their predatory business practices.
---
Then just search for a guild in some map chats (Lion's Arch is probably the best map for that, or some low level maps like Queensdale, Metrica, Caledon, etc) until you know which endgame content you wanna focus on.
---
Yeah, swapping from the left list means to confirm one more popup. Do you think people will pay 300gems to have one less popup or be able to use keybinds? I don't really see that.
---
is there anything to get from the extra life event yet? ingame it says travel to lions arch to claim bonus effects but i cant find any npc to talk to and when there the thing just says 0$ donated
---
For those interested, the current funded amount is around $13.7k as I write this.  You can see the exact amount on [Extra Life's Team Arenanet](https://www.extra-life.org/arenanet) page.
---
I do worry we won't reach the $80k goal, particularly with all the sourness over how Build Templates were implemented.
---
Can you actually copy paste codes to change armour templates or this only works with builds (traits, skills) templates?
---
and legendary sigils :)
---
I don't know, sharing puzzle jump tricks, new routes to farm gold, tips to optimize builds, Easter eggs as a post some days ago about accessing hidden areas in Dragon Fall... Mean interesting info about the game.
---
About complains on build templates, you've read one thread, you've read all, always same shit... Useless.
---
Trait and skills only.
---
I can definitely attest to this. It hardly sounds pleasant at all that the game gets engaging once you hit level 50 and onwards, but it is most definitely the case with FFXIV. The same goes for the Main Story that you participate in. It can start off real slow (the worst example being the spot between A Realm Reborn and Heavensward) but it gets really good later on. Would recommend also.
---
Yeah, right now if you want something **fixed** you also have to buy _character storage slots_, then you can save / load your builds.
---
Yet there's no "character equip template" to buy so if you change some item for a fractal singularity than that's it, template is changed, before swapping you have to remember _how it was supposed to be_ and manually reload the previous items...
---
Nothing has changed is far from the truth. If you want to do something like blasting using legendary weapons will now reset their upgrades. Any weapon change will now reset the sigils and infusions on the weapons that come off.
---
The workaround is to use templates to swap around or using ascended weapons.
---
Just copy paste links. Not such big deal...
---
there you go](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/634072553731653642/639014954514776074/anet_feedback.gif)  no need to spend any more cent for them
---
I dont think a lot will pay for something that can simply be copy pasted from Guild MotDs
---
Just think: Delta managed to make a template system for free, updated it for years and they did not even have access to the game code.
---
I mean, having multiple armor sets was still kind of a bother, before build templates. So that got easier. It's important to appreciate the positive changes I suppose.
---

Starting your journey to take down the Elder Dragons, huh?

---
If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
thats in addition to asc gear also allowing to save different skin layouts while legendary always have the same
---
Yeah that's a nice feature/oversight. Guess Anet will find a way to prevent that.
---
Well, believe it or not, I took both of these into consideration, especially the vulnerability part, but it's ok now. I have a better understanding of what's going on. \^\^
---
hahahaha
---
Semantic: can I use ARC template now _yes or no_?
---
I think the purpose is to have one tab for PvE, one for PvP and one for WvW.
---
Wow, you have something wrong with your head, not sure how you collate the two. Seek help.
---
Sure. But that’s not the point of this reply.
---
My reply was to answer his question of “how many templates you can buy with the sub money”
---
Arc already stopped working, as requested by Anet.
---
Nope, I only have 23 legendary weapons, 2 legendary back pieces and two legendary trinkets.
---
This. There's a reason nobody buys bag slots or extra crafting profession slots that are character bound. The equipment slots should be at 3 for parity with build slots and for even a basic Power, Condi, Support configurations
---
Leave as fast as you can and don't turn back.
---
I am 99% sure there will be a huge price drop in valuable infusions incoming (and maybe a banwave), since the duplication bug is close to impossible to not trigger when you have multiple legendary items... I got a few extra infusions just by setting up my gear templates.
---
or maybe convert a asc. item into a soulbound legy copy of one you already own?
---
Like you've never played GTA (or any other PEGI 18 game) while not being 18...
---
Agreed. People on here keep forgetting that buy to play mmos need a way to monitize their service. Yes anet has been dropping the ball often but they tend to fix/upgrade it soon after too. As for their content are people forgetting that they released a prelude episode to the new season that has THE SIZE AND CONTENT of a full episode? But no let's bash their attempt at ADDING a NEW SYSTEM to the game that doesn't rely on a third party. Yes the gem pricing for build templates and its max cap arent the best and deffinitly not the timing. Should've been implemented sooner way before adding seperate wvw and pvp builds. Also the layoffs are due to anet's mismanagment. They canned people after putting a hold on there second project. The rest returned to work on this game. Meaning the main focus went from the project back to gw2 AND you can tell if you look at the new map/story prelude episode.
---
Though the second you voice something like this this sub tends to get salty and downvote you.
---
no not anymore after i meddled with my inventory
---
Not sure if you can extract them, but, yeah, there is a good chance for rollback. The more ANet wait with it, the worse it gets.
---
I will not be using the build tabs, since I only have one. I do use the equipment ones though, until now I carried a bow and a staff around in my inventory. so those ones are in fact new. and I like it, and I don't need more. 
---
but I'm sure I would be pissed if I was more of a hardcore player
---
Oh fuck *off* that shit. If you had any resemblance of reading comprehension, you'd realize that I wasn't calling them out on their opinion. 
---
&gt; If you're going to quit, then do it. 
---
Key word is **quit.** Do you see the word "opinion" there? Nope.
---
It may seem hard to grasp but I actually agree with their view on the templates, even though I never used them myself. But what I don't get is why should people post about quitting the game, especially if it's with regurgitated talking points. The posts that pretty much outline what OP is saying are already on the front page. 
---
Why make your exit public? I didn't.
---
Just relog?
---
Yeah and that 1% is the "hardcore" players who like to do raids and fractals. Aka someone like me. I would rather put that money into another game that actually offers me something. Meh
---
Guild Wars 2 in nutshell :)
---
so... exactly what we had before the update, just actually functional and with auto-swapping on game mode change?
---
Vaccum your carpet :O It can be unhealty for your son
---
perfect tools for trolling ... gj anet at least you do something right
---
Wow, that’s some perspective alright
---
&gt; Semantic: can I use ARC template now yes or no?
---
of course you can use arc templates now, since its freeware, last time i checked. But you are probably not allowed to run gw2 while doing so.
---
Just avoid using that template slot until its fixed. Everytime you crash, you crash your whole instance, meaning all the players too.
---
Sounds like smart business to me. I don't see a problem?
---
even if you dont play 9 characters or just with 3-4 slots the cost is still ridiculous overpriced
---
the idea is great, the execution is terribad, and the monetization is just greedy AF. that being said you come across as if you do not even fully understand the basic functionality of the system as it is intended (for starters you are mixing up several aspects of the system), and you seem to not know that we already had seperate build slots for different game modes *that unlike the new system even automatically changed when switching modes*.
---
Everything Assnet has implemented has been half-assed.
---
Well as someone who wants multiple PVE builds and rarely plays WVW, woohoo!
---
A bunch of people who are complacent and don't want to find a new job grinding away at finding new ways to milk a player base per NCSoft directive.
---
Can we have arcdps templates back now?
---
Agree, when we're getting closer each time is when I have the most fun in raid encounters, even if it's one I've cleared in 1 pull before.
---
I just can't get in the mindset of someone who bails when the group is right on the cusp of getting it.
---
I guess you could argue breaking combat and insta swapping is an advantage, so it becomes fine when everyone can do it without an add on. Seems fine from that regard.
---
&gt; it's not like same person spams same topic,
---
It's like the same 5 people and their regurgitators spam the same 5 topics.
---
Same here
---
You shouldn't include those 3 "free" account build slots, since those are offered only for a limited amount of time.
---
hahaha oh god what a fucking mess, to think they took away our own community made build templates which worked just fine to sell us this garbage at a significant mark up... it's almost funny
---
Now I can't even tell what was the reason to add this feature... It sounded so good at first! I'm seriously starting to worry about the future of GW2...
---
-Public Test Servers-
---
Swapping between mods was actually easier for casuals like yourself before the change, bag space on the other hand, it's just those few slots for armor or trinkets in most cases.
---
&gt; So what's the damn hussle about?
---
"give constructive criticism and hopefully they'll fix that." - exactly that, they did not fix anything.
---
I feel like Anet is trying te replace it’s playerbase with one that’s even more casual and easily pays money in game without questioning it
---
draw more art and spam that instead. let me see subwars!
---
Absolutely, I was just going for the total cost they calculated. Not a lot of people need that.
---
do yourself a favor and look for another game if you dont plan to play this game ultra casual and want challenging content to any degree
---
The monthly sub is going towards an actually good game that churns out tons of content, including the very best storywriting in the industry.
---
That's why you hear on feedback. And don't shout down every criticism as "vocal minority"
---
no because this will just contain most of the important feedback so anet can ignore it even easier
---
If that is to be a remotely fair comparison, you’d have to filter out the vast majority of players who didn’t know that arc even existed...
---
They didn't make them obsolete, they made them character bound (which for you they seem they are) and worth 2 ascended sets that you are free to swap manually without cost. As having 2 ascended sets now doesn't take up any inventory space.
---
So yeah not worth to craft for example the pvp legendary armor versions as skin stays the same. But if you have it for 1 character only and considering arcDPS didn't change legendary armor this patch is a pure win for you. You basically received 1 free load-out and 1 to switch around with manually as you did before. Also takes away at least 1 set of sigil/runes from inventory.
---
It is far from perfect but for a player like you it is a win.
---
My first thought when I heard of the app
---
Sooo... Turns out equipment templates are, in fact, incompatible with legendary gear... if you try to use it for anything beside glorified ascended with a ridiculously high price tag. Funny. When I said I'll keep clicking to swap my gear because the system wouldn't allow me to do what I wanted, I didn't think it wouldn't even let me do basic setups. Hilarious, really. Oh well... Hey ANet, can I sell back one of my free equipment slots since I'm not going to use it anyway and not having it might save me from accidentally unequipping all my gear?
---
the demand isn't the issue, its the supply
---
Love the outfit and how happy he is! Just not sure if I would personally upload a picture of my child that's now permanently on the internet.
---
I've been with the franchise since 2006 because way back then, ANet's philosophy was to not nickel and dime their players. In fact people may not remember this but "respecting the players" used to be the big tag line for Anet and for GW. It was a game and company that respected your time and your money and was known for consumer friendliness. 
---
So while I'm not taking it personally you can imagine my disappointment.
---
Link please I want to see this. Im 100% certain people would have given heavy feedback on this functionality.
---
Guys. I know. You downvote me while I am bashing so hard at Arenanet at every post. I am just saying that Arenanet doesn't have the BALLS to reduce the price. They don't have the neither the BALLS nor the PR to deal with those who already bought them at the said price.
---
They ruined the game experience for me personally as a veteran player and dedicated raider. Same with many of my friends and guild mates.
---
It‘s sad to see this trend by Anet. Monetization over everything.
---
The whole system is unfortunate for "serious players", all they do is design for casual that may drop money on the gem store.
---
I'd agree if ANet didn't just ban arc build templates
---
&gt; (if it's such a problem, just keep doing what you were doing before)
---
except that we can't....
---
maybe alt+numpad ?
---
Do you vacuum the streets and parks as well before you let your kids out of your bubble?
---
Generally in open world play, what's the better mount between Griffon and Skyscale? i.e. Between these two which would allow me to traverse through open world maps more quickly? Some people have stated that Griffons are generally faster while others said that as soon as they got the Skyscale they stopped using all other mounts. 
---
I just got up to about 250g and I'm not sure what to splurge on first.
---
I'm just saying there is a middle ground. Yes, 3 slots per character is not a lot, 300 gems per additional one is expensive, and limiting to 6 total is also a bit stupid. 
---
But it's also stupid to assume everyone is now forced to spend 400$ to be able to play the game somewhat like before. that is an edge-case.
---
I'm gonna guess she's gonna be the new Kas-and-Jory and be absent for the duration of the arc
---
Your ignoring the fact he was game director when the Queensdale champ train was removed.
---
See, that’s what I’ve read...my GPU usage is like 30%, I’m just a little confused why my fps isn’t higher in the empty areas when similar builds I’ve read about seem to be faring much better.
---
Let's face it. They wouldn't be payed better if anet turned more profit.
---
now you better watch your back around the house
---
Griffons is better in places where you have room downside so you can dive down to get the speed boost, skyscale is better if you have to move up hills often
---
I'm sure the anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers and climate change deniers would disagree too, but it doesn't mean they're correct by any stretch of the imagination.
---
Did you just delete and re-create your thread because it was getting downvoted?
---
&gt;The convenience of having it one one character... especially if you already have legendaries...
---
Oh, not being able to quick-swap your weapon because the template system would remove its sigils and infusions is extremely convenient, I admit. Turns out if I want to use my legendaries I actually have to keep my second gear template empty. Very quality, such wow, many convenience.
---
I guess I should actually thank ANet for being considerate enough to not offer me any reasons at all to buy that shit.
---
And there's no "Equip Storage" yet
---
Objectively, the templates are great.  There should be more of them.  And they should be free, or a tenth of the cost.
---
Put it in perspective, to unlock all build/gear slots for a single character costs more than a copy of the game.
---
&gt; Whatever. I don't think I'll be logging in anymore.
---
Been on a (lately) usual month long break, as i heard the bad bt news, and now every time i'm about to return those news keep coming.
---
If you dont plan to play this game ultra casual and dont want any challaging content to any degree like fractals dont come back.
---
Since PoF its really got downhill contend wise for dedicated/hardcore/veteran players and the monetization gets worse and worse...
---
Also quite funny. It‘s cheaper buying new character slots and using the buildtemplates on them than buying BTs......
---
Sure, give me back the autoswap between modes and arcdps buildtemplates and then I won't.
---
But as it stands, I just won't play. And I certainly won't pay.
---
Just like they asked for feedback for the balance patch and we've seen how that went.
---
For me its an huge im improvment.
---
The ability to switch from dmg weaver to heal tempest in one buttom press is awesome. (wvw)
---
But did i need them before? Nope.
---
Yeah, auto-attack is basically a skill like every other. You'll even have some rare weapons or builds in which auto-attack is not part of your rotation because it's more of a situational skill!
---
My vault is overflowing with ascended gear that I don’t actually need, I still made Legi armour weapons jewellery runes and sigils for every available slot. Why? Because I wanted to! I wanted to have a goal to achieve, something to spend my gold and mats on, 
---
I really have no idea what I would do if I didn’t have legendarily items to make, I would play each living world story and raid wing once then log off until the next one 3-6 months later
---
Also I like being able to change the stats on 90% of my gear whenever I want, and not having to sort through 100s of different sets of boots to find the one with the right stats/sigils/infusions
---
I get that not everyone will see ‘value’ in legendary gear, but one play style does not make another play style better or worse
---
Can't get frustrated by gear templates if you only play the same build in PvE :foreheadpoint:
---
Yeah IKR? It's absolutely shocking that people still whiteknight ANet after they see what impact this broken shit has for many others. 
---
Seriously. I can't believe a player base like ours can't stand together. Yeah bla bla casuals like it. I'm a casual, used to raid and I hate it even with a causal gameplay. It made things worse, period. And we should all stand together and fight for a better, well thought solution. 
---
It's nuts to keep pointing out some might like it - the system still keeps broken for the most who actually want or need to use it.
---
Actually when this game first launched Anet designed it with a pvp focus in mind, they actually made dungeon additions for pve, later addee fractals and the first 3 raids came out with a good cadence. Then they realised it was much easier to push their design implementations toward people who dont know how their game works after 1k hours which is why the only thing that saved PoF were mount skins sales. You can have fun with this bad game no one said you couldnt im just doing my part in informing people about the real problems this game has so they dont waste their time when the take a step in and are wondering why there no content development for the game mode they are investing into at endgame.
---
I need more than 3. I have about 12 on Ranger if you include all game modes. What do you think of the method?
---
It can't work that way because it actually stores the items for the build in the build itself. If you could be in build A, swap out a bunch of gear, and then switch *to* build A, then there would be all sorts of confusion regarding your inventory that their system isn't designed to deal with.
---
I would agree, but I also play Mirage in PvP and WvW, and...that's two, plus PvE, plus raid chrono builds...it's the one class where I need more than three. And now I have to manually toggle for PvP and WvW...
---
His expression is just perfect, looks like he's about to gank some poor group on viscount &gt;:)
---
Adding on to u/stagrunner's response, ANet forcefully shut down ArcDPS Build Templates two weeks ago in preparation for this feature. So now everyone who has been using it for the past two years, or who wanted to use it, are screwed.
---
And if you ever want to play open world + fractals + raids + WvW with *more* than just 6 gear templates across all game modes, which is very easy to do on classes like Mesmer and Guardian, then you are screwed. Essentially, ANet just struck another nail into the coffin that is GW2's endgame for anyone who wants to do more than just auto-attack.
---
now to watch metabattle freak out and adjust
---
This would require also overhauling the transmutation system unless players were willing to use outfits or design multiple characters to look good in the same armor/dye combination. Cultural armor skins? Up yours!
---
Nice advertising a live disguised as a "psa"
---
Not only was this game not created with PvP in mind, but Anet said straight out, more than once, that they didn't even talk about PvP for the first year of promotion so that people wouldn't assume it was centered around PvP.  They spoke more about a living breathing world and dynamic events. They brought the Shatterer and Shadow Behemoth to shows. 
---
They had one PvP type at launch, for SPvP and of course WvW.  But this game was always meant to be centered on a dynamic event and a living breathing world. It was the first thing you saw when you went to their website...a living breathing world.
---
Any idea when (or if) etherbound gloves and boots will be avaiable in gem store again? I recently bought Pauldrons.
---
THanks :)
---
can i get your golds? mats?
---
Do you raid? Heal druid and handkite are vastly different builds for vastly different purposes in raids. Add to that the now mandatory PvP template, seeing as they removed the ones we had earlier and we're at three. No builds for WvW, no builds for the higher tier fractals, where the numbers do start to count a lot.
---
Does anyone truly need so many builds to play GW2? Maybe not. Are they made because the content does require a certain amount of optimization to complete? Very much yes.
---
they may be actually serious, never uderestimate people...problems are, as you mention elswhere , system is clumsy, not changing your build when you log into pvp and wvw is fascinating flaw and even I, which used precisly this as I need (for swaping two builds -raids support and open world pve) can see issiues. 
---
Not mention money it actually cost to be somehow good to use. But that bother myself less as i have 28 chars....
---
Oh god, I haven't been on but was planning to. What happened now?
---
Lmao, the poster removed his reply. Read his shit before you comment.
---
Thanks for the response! If you had to use one of the two mounts for the next year, would you pick skyscale over griffon? :)
---
Oh hi Guild Wars 2 white knights.
---
**Do you think they (we) are wrong though?**
---
Because every time it feels very fucking justified to rage about a simple thing (I understand its not so simple) that has been asked for nearly 5 years. 
---
Not bashing on the meme btw, I get it, but figured I'd open some discussion about the topic because really, jokes aside, the sub bitches and complains and rages and it might seem bitter, but discussion is heavily suppressed in the original forums.
---
Interesting, I've revisited my drafts yesterday and I had a similar, but a little bit different concept... it's a long wall of text and some images, though. Don't want to hijack your post.
---
a couple of weeks ago, I wanted to forge some legendary runes but forged gifts of prosperity instead as they use nearly the same ingredients. Contacted support, deleted the gifts and got the ingredients mailed to me as replacements
---
No, there was no GTA when I was sub 18
---
Adding on to u/stagrunner's response, ANet forcefully shut down ArcDPS Build Templates two weeks ago in preparation for this feature's release. So now everyone who has been using it for the past two years, or who wanted to use it (like me), are screwed.
---
And if you ever want to play open world + fractals + raids + WvW with *more* than just 6 gear templates across all game modes, which is very easy to do on classes like Mesmer and Guardian, then you are screwed too. Essentially, ANet just struck another nail into the coffin that is GW2's endgame for anyone who wants to do more than just auto-attack. Which is absolutely terrible for a game that was designed around horizontal gear &amp; character progression, instead of the shitty vertical progression that often plagues the industry as a whole.
---
Considering that I've been used to spend 10-20€ monthly on the gemstore for the first years (guess until around PoF release) it would not have made a difference for me. 
---
I've said back then that I wouldn't mind paying a subscription fee if that meant anet had a reliable income and would be able to create content without the pressure of maximising profit.
---
Well yeah that post was meant as sarcasm itself. I know these idiots are serious and I honestly can't believe why people are dumb enough to feed ANet positive feedback on this. It just harms the whole process and blurrs out everything negative
---
The method is absolutely what I would be using, if I were using the templates
---
You know what also blurrs out everything negative? The people posting negative things while also abusing everyone who disagrees with them. It is very hard to take people serious when they feel the need to call people who don't share their opinion for idiots.
---
&gt; What do you think of the method?
---
nothing wrong with your method but it was first posted, when they made the first blog post about build templates over a month ago and has already been posted like 5 times since they went live yesterday.
---
Feel free to send it ;)
---
2 of its 3 main game modes were pvp focused and Anet tried (and failed miserably) at creating an esports league at launch but yes go ahead and ignore the blatant obvious signs.
---
woosh
---
Forsaken is on sale on Steam at the moment, too.
---
Fun as D2 is nobody *talks.*  I like that GW2 is fairly chatty.
---
Honestly, your comment just seems to be about the implementation of the system. There are most definitely bugs right now, but once they fix them (which, given that it's a partially paid feature, should not take too long) I don't see what is wrong with the system.
---
&gt; joining a pvp or wvw instance overwrites whatever build you had on in those modes
---
PvP and WvW builds were stored in the tabs as expected. If you are referring to the need to switch builds manually now, yes that's annoying.
---
&gt; the gear stored in the templates has to be unequipped from the template to be used
---
I guess that's about sharing gear between characters? Not too sure how much of a problem this is because I always found it to be too annoying.
---
&gt; the template "dynamically" saves the changes you make while you have a template equipped meaning you have to set everythign back before you switch
---
That's what I'd use the account-wide storage for:
---
1. save your current build to the storage
---
2. experiment
---
3. load your build from the storage
---
I don't really see what other purpose the account-wide storage has anyway given that it's just a glorified clipboard with minor QoL.
---
My main has a support build in Slot 1 and a condi build on slot 2 - both on the build and gear templates.
---
I used the keybinds on the numlock so numlock 1 is bound to the support build and numlock 4 (directly above) is bound to the support gear. Condi build is on numlock 2 and condi gear is on numlock 5 (again, directly above). Same with numlock 3 and 6 (WvW build and WvW gear) 
---
My other builds, that I don't use often, are all in a text file on my desktop. I just copy paste them in the third build template slot if I need them.
---
Then why are new episodes, that take months to be made, are free for people who play the game and have bought a cheap expansion from 2 years ago?
---
Not everyone who used Arcdps said we'd pay for ANET to give substandard triple monetized dysfunctional UI. If Anet planned on monetizing it they should have said no to the third-party app or packaged it with an actual expansion.
---
mayby they just like to argue.... or feel like they need defend their poistion of liking anet. Just to feel special. You can see it literally everywhere, in every discussion about anything. Its world we create with giving everyone a voice and media to spread it .... but thats for bigger discussion thats one about our game added mechanics :D
---
This is only really useful for new players who don’t have access to shared inventory slots
---
But thanks for sharing
---
I still hope it is not only Anet that makes These decisions but rather NCsoft or some shit like that. 
---
Because as of right now, the monetization is Overall just awful. And Living World is not always free Content, some People Login now and have to buy Episode after Episode, season after season. New Players especially, Expansion and all the seasons are alot more than what you pay for any other MMO to get all Batches of Content and story
---
Can I have your gold.
---
Yeah, I never ask for KP and many people ping it anyway. Like bruh, I just want to know your role. I've seen someone who has never even seen a boss do better than experienced players. I've seen people with 100+ KP hold the group back.
---
Basically, KP is exactly that—kill proof (assuming that it isn't fake). It can be bought. It can be unrightfully earned (i.e. getting carried). And it says almost nothing about the competency or capabilities of the player. In that regard, it's rather inconsistent.
---
My policy is that if you're confident enough to join an experienced group, then I'm going to initially share that confidence. If you hold the group back, then you get kicked.
---
Amazing... and for some reason, I'm not even surprised.
---
I saw this at another comment somewhere in this build templates flood so I will say it here again. It was something along the lines of "build templates are great for casuals, people who don't care/mind much, but they are a **big shaft** for more hardcore and invested players". 
---
I really think that the above statement is very very true. Most people sadly, do not even check forums or know of their existence, let alone reddit. All those people will just think oh, cool! another new thing. They just do not care enough to know and learn more, let alone that the original forums get suppressed and actually impactful stuff are considered negative and toxic and therefore, deleted. Its a big big shame.
---
That's why the total cost for a new player to follow the story is fucked up.
---
&gt; now a big chunk of the game's legacy devs left to start a new studio
---
When did this happen?  After the layoffs earlier this year?  That was the last big bit of drama I'm aware of; my interest in the game plummeted sometime after that and I haven't really stuck around for more than dailies in months.
---
You like going to WvWvW and/or PvP and not having your templates for those modes automatically enabled?
---
I haven't tried it yet (and I only have one legendary weapon anyway) but doesn't equipping a weapon automatically add it to the template you're currently on?
---
You don’t though....
---
PoF locations are truly amazing. Mounts are awesome too (all of them except Griffon/SKyscale are relatively free)..
---
GW2 is an awesome MMO that offers tons of playtime for minimum investment..
---
Its a rare drop and at the same time its time gated, not the best combination
---
Pretty much every addon breaks "unfair advantage". Taco, GwHook, AugTyria, ArcDPS, even Radial Mount Menu, etc
---
They all improve your gameplay from "minor convenience" to "major advantage over person not using it".
---
Thing is they do not undermine Anet finical line. So they do not care. Thing is unless they use spyware again, they unlikely to catch "build template hackers".
---
Well, I don't call people with different opinions idiots. I call idiots idiots. If they would've actually well thought opinions I wouldn't complain. But it's nothing but mindless whiteknighting.
---
But build templates were introduced yesterdy, are you a time traveler? Will arenanet fix their pvp before 2035?
---
Same with bag slots. Stupid paid per-character unlocks should go away.
---
He is a low effort white knight.
---
Problem is that game do not offer any real content for quite a while (last 2 years). WvW and raids are stale and bleeding to death, PvP is dead bot clown fiesta...
---
So what to do in the game? Work towards your account progression: Mount skins, Legendaries, storage, bag and build slots. there is literally nothing to do in the game aside to farm fro gemstore upgrades at this point if you somewhat played the game for last 7 years.
---
Just finished the HoT main quest on my mesmer and got the broken caladbolg. Some questions:
---
1) Do i have to soulbind the caladbolg in order to get the letter to reforge it?
---
2) After I reforge it, can I transfer the completed weapon to my ranger who has not done HoT story yet?
---
Like that time they raged about the arc templates bans 4Head. Very justified.
---
I've been saying it for ages the devs literally don't play the game
---
&gt;socializing? I did not know that you can running around in a circle and flaming anyone who kills a boss out of roatione me more than to see a  bunch of players doing things together and socializing. 
---
socializing? I did not know that you can running around in a circle and flaming / harassing anyone who kills a boss out of rotation socializing.
---
Oh God are you serious? You're actually comparing the dye system to content relevant topics or gameplay relevant topics? 
---
Just, please don't.
---
"exist" is a bit of a stetch though... one is empty and the other has 1 post.
---
The only thing keeping me away from ESO is the clunky and jerky combat.
---
Say what you will about Gw2, it's combat system remains peerless in the MMO sphere. No other is as smooth and responsive.
---
Its not a bug though, ascended is just more convenient now
---
well, my guess is that they will wait with a megathread until the first outrage has died down a bit and then actively start deleting duplicate posts regarding build templates while now they only moderate/delete threads regarding build templates, if they get reported by other users.
---
Oh no, all those posts about the latest controversial feature are blocking your sight. Now you can't see those fine art posts. If I draw you something will it make you feel better?
---
Changing builds manually was mildly infuriating at first, but after setting up hotkeys, using build templates became very convenient and playing the game actually became better. Quality of life. I can now press quick key combination to swap builds instead of changing character, which was often inconvenient.
---
For example if I play DH roamer build in WvW, but then a commander appears and needs a support FB, I simply press two (build and gear) key combinations and join the commander. This is also very convenient if there is a queue.
---
I personally love this implementation of build templates, it is such a quality of life, I don't know how to play without it anymore.
---
You just need to get used to press some extra keys when changing gamemode. It will became automatic reflex in time.
---
Mules naked. Iron farmers pink. Flax farmers acid green.
---
Welp okay, here we go, since we already have a similar idea. Better to focus it in one thread:
---
**Disclaimer**: Please keep in mind that I’m not a developer of any sorts. I have no knowledge about Arenanets inventory code, how difficult it would be to implement and what would have to be changed on their end. I do know they didn’t want to touch the inventory code, though.
---
##What I think is wrong with Arenanets “template” system
---
There are a few things that rub me the wrong way with how they implemented “templates”
---
* Builds were separated per game mode and automatically loaded when entering them. They no longer do that.
---
* Equipment and build heavily depend on each other, there is no way to link them.
---
* It’s somewhat too limited
---
* Equipment can no longer be shared easily without breaking your “template”, as you store them in gear slots now
---
* They’re not templates
---
##What could be improved/changed?
---
* Separate game modes again and let us set a default build per game mode
---
* Separate equipment templates from actually storing the items on the character
---
* Combine build and equipment templates to a single template
---
* Make them actual templates
---
##So, how would that look like?
---
###Your basic inventory (un)changed
---
[The Inventory Screen: Overview](https://i.imgur.com/9BFVJ5x.png)
---
Basically, you’ll still have an inventory and a build screen separate from the templates themselves. You can (un)equip items here or change stats, upgrades and infusions depending on the rarity of your gear. Any change you make here won’t affect the currently active template, but you can save it to your active template with the click of a button.
---
[The Inventory Screen: Gear](https://i.imgur.com/0G2kR94.png)
---
This is still the normal inventory, but everything that is relevant to the build and actual armor has been moved to the left and right sides of the character. Everything else (which is basically just gathering tools) is still on the far right along with the attributes.
---
Equipment, Builds and Wardrobe are now tabs above the character, rather than separate sub-menus.
---
[The Build Screen](https://i.imgur.com/EGxmgr8.png)
---
Nothing out of the ordinary. As explained above, this is the current build screen where you can change traits on the fly but won’t affect the template you loaded.
---
[Bonus: The Wardrobe](https://i.imgur.com/0nY7vAw.png)
---
So the wardrobe now has its own slots in a build. Here, you equip skins, not gear. It will still work like it does currently: you select a slot, you select a skin, you apply it with transmutation charges.The difference: you’re applying the skin to the slot, not to the item itself. You’ll only be charged for applying skins. You can turn on the dye channels via a button on the bottom.
---
The layout of the slots has changed slightly: outfit- and glider-slots are now part of the wardrobe inventory! You can either activate your favourite outfit or use the armor skins - the functionality is the same as now.
---
You may have spotted miniatures, mail carriers and finishers as well. Since they’re basically just skins, I wanted to merge them with the overall wardrobe to not have them all in a single tab with just one slot respectively.
---
What I’m not sure about are novelties, since there is a (very low but still) possibility that it could get expanded on. They either get integrated as well or get their own tab away from the wardrobe.
---
###The actual templates
---
Templates in this concept are actually templates and are stored in a sub-section of the hero windwo which I call the “armory”. They do not change whenever you change a skill, trait or armor piece - only if you want to, and only on your command.
---
However, you can set one active build for every game mode which will automatically load whenever you enter the respecitve game mode again.
---
[The Template Overview: Equipment](https://i.imgur.com/J9S7ajE.png)
---
The templates consist of three tabs, much like the inventory: equipment, skills &amp; traits and wardrobe. You can change the name of the template via context menu or the edit - button on the top right corner. You can also change the game mode of the template in the settings section and set your active template simply by checking it on the list on the left side.
---
####Equipment Template
---
[Screenshot: Equipment Template](https://i.imgur.com/qAKcLA7.png)
---
The equipment template saves the kind of armor, weapons and trinkets you’d like to use in your build. The information that is stored is: the item you put in there (rarity, stats, upgrades and infusion/s). When loading a template, it checks for the item in your inventory or currently equipped gear. If it’s not there, it won’t be equipped, if you have legendary gear and everything else (infusions, upgrades) in your inventory, it’ll be changed accordingly. (I guess this is how ArcDPS worked, no?)
---
####Skill &amp; Trait Template
---
[Screenshot: Skill &amp; Trait Template](https://i.imgur.com/138Hhah.png)
---
There’s not much to say here… it’s pretty self explanatory and works exactly as it does now.
---
####Wardrobe Template
---
[Screenshot: WardrobeTemplate](https://i.imgur.com/X7avaxf.png)
---
That’s new! Now you can even have fashion wars templates. Remember earlier when I talked about the wardrobe applying skins to slots? You can use that in templates and have different looks for different builds! Finally you can see at a first glance what build you just loaded accidently (This basically enables you to use the same item in different builds AND have a different skin for it as well),
---
You can also have different finishers, mail carriers and minis for every build now.
---
####Equipment Template: PvP
---
[Screenshot: PvP Template](https://i.imgur.com/31lnnu2.png)
---
Since PvP does not use equipment but amulets, the equipment template tab changes from armor and trinket slots to a single amulet slot. Skills &amp; Traits and Wardrobe remains the same. Additionally, a fourth tab appears for the Mist Champion. Maybe?
---
####Gathering Tools
---
I didn’t put gathering tools in the templates as I didn’t want to bloat it even further, but I could imagine that it makes sense to have gathering templates for different glyphs.
---
###Sharing templates
---
Arenanet would need a better way to store the information for sharing since equipped items, skills, traits are A LOT of information for a single build to share.
---
The current chatcode for skills &amp; traits only is [&amp;DQcBJRgtOx3uFSMPZQGAAYEBgQGDAYMBRhe8AQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=]
---
, which is pretty long. Now imagine you’d get additional information for armor pieces, weapons, their upgrades and infusions. That chat link would be huge. Unfortunately I have no idea how this could be handled. 
---
* Maybe a file export / import?
---
* Huge chatlinks with generic names?
---
* Sharing skins doesn’t seem to make much sense right now. Maybe allow to individually share a skin template with information about skin and dyes per slot.
---
###What about mounts?
---
Mounts are not part of the template system, they get to keep their own tab in the inventory window. Since there is no individual dye tab anymore (it’s integrated in the wardrobe as a toggle), they also get a toggle to turn on dye channels.
---
###Additional Notes
---
####Inventory Space &amp; Monetization
---
Since this concept does not use gear slots as storage, you’ll have to use your inventory. So what better opportunity to offer more bag slots - but for gear only. These slots could be character bound, placed below the other inventory bags and work like inventory bags, but actually not counted against the inventory. 
---
**What do I mean by that?**
---
* You can only use these slots for gear and upgrades
---
* Up for discussion: You can put (special?) bags in there and expand one slot with up to x spaces for gear / fixed amount of bag space?
---
* You have to fill these bags manually, no loot or anything else you pick up will go there automatically
---
* Templates only look in the gear storage for… well, the gear you specified in the templates.
---
Even writing this down, the concept still feels complicated. It probably is even more complex and complicated to implement.
---
This is the end, you made it! [Full album of mockups](https://imgur.com/a/g7Wkqgf)
---
I don’t know if I gave it too much thought or not enough, but it was fun playing with the interface for a bit.
---
Dude why are you even doing pvp in gw2? They dont want you in there! Just go play any other game for pvp and then come back with you visa/mastercard to buy shit in the gemstore like the game was designed..
---
because people would rather put all their crappy memes here, instead of using those subs
---
I mean I get it, you do have to earn your white-knight points for Anet.
---
If you spammed this on other actually low effort posts such as various cringe 'fanarts' or any of the other memes that are posted here that don't show Anet in a negative light I'd side with you. But seeing how you spam this only on threads that are showing Anet for what they truly are tells me everything I need to know.
---
If you want your walls of text to be read, try formatting them.
---
&gt; You really need to work some shit out in your life if you think I was the one whining there. 
---
Comes in to whine about people venting, is shocked when he gets told to fuck off. I'm definitely the one who needs to look at himself aye. Proceeds to pretend that he wasn't whining.
---
&gt; However, you might want to re-evaluate yourself if an issue like this pisses you off so much in a VIDEO GAME 
---
I would suggest a good hard look in the mirror hun. People venting on reddit seems to piss you off. So do consider your own advice. ~~And fuck right off.~~ Sorry sorry I mean "Maybe take a break"
---
Thanks! Are those 2 the only flying mounts or is there an easy to get flyer?
---
It's not even 10 % true lol. You can say most of the skins come through gem store, but pretty much every bigger content patch has some weapon or armor skins you earn in game.
---
And yeah there recently was a big drought in end game PvE stuff like fractal/raid/dungeon type content. And you can absolutely be unhappy with when they do it is too easy for your taste (latest raid wing and the strike mission thing). But to simply state " This game is not getting raids This game is not getting dungeons This game is not getting fractals " is blatantly a lie and not true.
---
What the fuck
---
Jea no one still uses arc, how would they?
---
Actually I freed a lot of space since I had 2 equip for free. So my support 6+6+2+2 equip items are no more in a Bag of their own
---
System is not perfect but is good enough.
---
Your complains are so weird
---
Wouldn't have to if there weren't so many and they all break the rules, which is apparently ok? Why even have them?
---
&gt; Since GW2 has no PTR or the sort, Arenanet has to rely on live, or on feelers from community announcements compared to data from live, to try and gauge.
---
I never really understood why GW2 didn't have a public test server. It's been clear, since basically day one back when the game launched, that a lack of a PTS (where you can have hundreds of players banging on new content until it breaks in ways that would likely occur during normal game play on live) has been hurting the game. Bugs that should never have made it into live builds survive largely because they're only exposed when large sets of players start doing the content repeatedly. Similarly, Anet has no way of getting feedback on intangibles like "is this content fun? is it rewarding?"
---
I'd say I'd like to see Anet shape up but at this point I suspect it's far too late.
---
We re panished like we re f2p (it having anything with f2p).
---
Remind me the f2p option in swtor tbh.
---
A damned ruined system.
---
How about you read the complaints and try to educate yourself?
---
No. We cry those are garbage, offer too few slots for people who actually would use it, and that they were never playtested, seeing how utterly broken templates are when it comes to legendary equipment.   
---
It's not bollocks, it's a gaming alegory for ordering a tomato soup and wanting it be remade because you found a fly it in. Except here there's a bunch of flies and very little soup.
---
Plant bomb b.
---
I tried quite a bit to mess with infusions and the templates, but apart from a few crashes while 'unequipping from all templates' nothing else happened. Nothing went missing or was duplicated. Now, of course that's only me and I am sure I've missed possibilities.
---
He can't. His head is so deep in anet's anus that he can barely hear himself.
---
you can right click copy and paste one template to the other so it doesn’t unequip
---
Great work! I'm joinning to post too with my different alternative design: [https://imgur.com/a/ma8YuvE](https://imgur.com/a/ma8YuvE) (its only simple and still draft)
---
I used the already designed build templates as now to one build. The idea is the same as main post by [u/Linuky](https://www.reddit.com/user/Linuky/).
---
So if I understand correctly, instead of three builds(PvE, sPvP &amp; WvW), we now have two to see us through the three game modes?
---
This was a band aid fix for a glitch that could be abused by quickly mounting on skyscale while dismounting from other mounts.
---
Sounds about right.
---
You can follow the [guide here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Knight_of_the_Thorn), you need to wait till reset to get the letter. Yes you can use the weapon however you like once you get it and all ascended items are just account bound anyways, they can always be moved around.
---
And if they doubled the max would you then say it takes 4-5 years of subs to pay for it? Just because there is a max does not mean you have to aim or calculate for it.
---
It is just a convenience thing which definitely need improvement (automatically change build when change mode again first and foremost) . But you make it sound you can't play the game unless you have 5 equipment sets. While everyone has been playing this game over the last few years with just 1 and inventory space (Which is also still a option over buying new slot).
---
Equipment slots: 4 * 9 = 36 slots * 500 gems = 18,000 gems.
---
Build slots: 3 * 9 = 27 slots * 300 gems = 8,100 gems.
---
Account build slots: 18 * 500 = 9,000 gems
---
Total gems = 18,000 + 8,100 + 9,000 = 35,100 gems.
---
Total cost = $438.
---
That’s two years and 5 months worth of FF subscription hmmmm.
---
So you literally now need to wait with the PvP/WvW build activated to not reach the first place of the queue with the wrong build?
---
Never used trmplates before. Dont need them now. DH main Same build for year atleast lol
---
I dropped the game 15 October. Me and half of my semi-hardcore guild.
---
They should use this orb on the templates.
---
It's not the price, it's the features
---
Yikes
---
Seems to me you just made this post for the sake of bitching because the majority of the complaints are for a valid reason beyond just the prices, or did you cherry-pick specific bandwagon drama posts?
---
What was your reaction?
---
Why not as a fucking in game reward for an achievement?
---
Anet in summary : missed opportunities
---
nah, in gw1 you could load and save directly from and to a text file.
---
Yeah. They'll remove comments pointing out their own rules, but won't remove the posts breaking them.
---
Tells me all I need to know.
---
&gt; Just because it has a different name doesn't make it different. Hell since strike has 5 men option you could call the strike mission a dungeon.
---
Sure! Since i am allowed to pull shit out of thin air in that case FF added 100 fractals last year with Heaven on High release. 
---
&gt; Does it literally have to be marketed. "hey this is a dungeon" to satisfy you?
---
It has to be a dungeon to be a dungeon. Strike mission is not a dungeon, festival boss fight is not a dungeon. 1/3 of a dungeon in 7 years is not frequent.
---
the concern is legitimate.. just look at the rest of the apartment looks like a messys / hoarders house
---
Didn't they say they are unable to make template codes for gear?
---
And wouldn't that imply that they're unable to make actual gear templates in general?
---
Really makes you wonder how fucked up their coding is
---
&gt; Wow, the community made a movie?
---
Just don't watch it until after you finish your personal story. It'll make more sense then.
---
I'm pretty sure that was a joke? 😯
---
Meh... veterans can outplay people like me in any build. Still doesn't stop us from having fun in WvW
---
I'm sorry, but this is kinda funny 😆
---
&gt;free for people who ***were active while it was relevant***
---
Not necessarily cool feature. But what's it's supposed to do is save different spec templates in case you have one for condi slb, power slb, druid for example.
---
weebs &gt; furries
---
I always feel like that anet has no real good programmers that try to work on a solution for something, but instead they put something together that somehow works and cover it up with all the fancy UI stuff which no one really needs.
---
I dont understand how they even came up with this, all we wanted was one click to load equipment/skills + traits and change it on the fly out of combat. That the equipment templates work like a bag is nice, but it wasnt even necessary as long as it loads what i saved.
---
Im not a programmer so i have no clue how hard it really is, but i would have been fine with a simple dropdown menue with templates i saved
---
totally agree
---
I also tried it and gave up around the same level.  I wanted to like it, but found it mind numbingly boring.  I'd rather do the washing up.  I did like the gfx and didn't mind the GCD.
---
I think you can pay to skip large parts of the game now though, but that does feel kinda like paying a fine to avoid a sentence.
---
Look mate, if you're ending it up on a phrase like that I'm not even going to bother with whatever else it is you're saying.
---
What, really?
---
Again proves that they don't play their game enough
---
I've been getting that since last night's patch. It happens only when I'm playing around with build templates though.
---
There are 3 specialization/perk templates and 2 gear templates available free per character.  
---
The implementation has been that there is no container for each build, you work directly off the templates... Meaning your PvE WvW and PvP builds are the 3 templates you are given basic access to.  Then there are 2 gear templates, presumably one for PvE and one for WvW.  SPvP uses a completely separate system that doesn't involve gear in your inventory so no third gear template there.  
---
Ultimately it shipped replacing the current system, giving us an extra equipment template, but to actually use the thing as "build templates" generally suggests you have to start buying immediately.  Those purchases are per character, and a full "build template" in this game includes gear.  So if you're running a build based off a single set of armor, you can buy new builds at 300 gems each.  If you have a completely different build (Power, Condi, Support...all of which require completely different gear loadouts) you're looking at a bare minimum of 800 gems per character, or continuing to use the system the same way you have been previously, except having to remember to change your build/gear template when you change game modes.
---
Its mmo game. Not every item/content has to be for you. Just ignore what you dont want. This rant makes no sense.. just dont buy it.. thats all..
---
After the livestream it was all over this sub. People complaining that even 6 slots for equipment loadouts would be to little, that arcDPS provides better functionality and that the character bound nature of it is bullshit.
---
TBH This makes sense outside of PvP because there's likely a limitation with character bound items inside the "storage" aspect of gear ~~templates~~loadouts.
---
Blizcon is incomming this weekend!
---
DC, map resets, skill lags, bugs - unfortunately, the game is unplayable in current state :(
---
Why does it matter? You can easily just ignore or not click on these posts if you don't like them so much. 
---
And so what if they're regurgitated points, people are bound to share similar opinions on major topics like these, you can't expect everyone to read through every post to make sure they're not overlapping.
---
Such a shame where the company is going to in general. We should have been playing an expansion with build templates as its feature right now. Instead, we have build templates with expansion price.
---
Can someone tells me how this works?
---
Final Fantasy XIV and some good old Guild Wars (1)
---
Yeah like a month before they released
---
The build template bug I'm talking about only crashes you, has nothing to do with lag or similar.
---
It's fine, and I suspect the vast majority are either fine with it or indifferent.
---
I recommend anet does the same
---
This is a typical situation where it is not as black and white as you are painting it now.
---
There are a truckload of people that didn't want to bother with arcDPS for one reason or another, and another truckload that have no idea that this even existed in the first place. In the end, **this is a feature for every player, not just the one that used the arc version before.**
---
So they very much do need to take into account the people who haven't used it before for this feature, alongside the architecture and logistics(including monetization, of course) of this feature on both the client and server side of things, and out of all that comes chosen limits and whatsnot, based on what the majority of people are going to do with.
---
That's the objective part, and there's nothing stupid about it.
---
Well, the difference is they don't sell lists like that on the gemstore.
---
Are there any games that don't have predatory pricing schemes? Like I'm fine voting with my wallet but I don't want to support the same thing in a different game either. So I'll probably just end up with more money in savings.
---
I respect you for deleting it.
---
There are good ways to make money and bad ways to make money, monetizing build templates is a bad way. I don't need to be right or wrong, the proof is everywhere around us now. Is it our fault GW2's monetization is garbage? Having to wait a couple months just for something super time limited to turn up in the gemstore so people who want it can finally buy it? People don't buy outfits and ArenaNet knows why, yet they don't even care to change how they work so we can finally mix individual pieces around or disable more than just the head slot. GW2's strength is cosmetics and customizing your look, why are there unbreakable salvage tools in the gemstore instead of just harvesting skins? Why are there better salvage kits in the gemstore? Smarter monetization pls.
---
Of course I meant before that. At that point the development process was basically at the end.
---
We get skins with the stories that is correct but they are very few and for some you need to have ridiculous luck to get them. and i think op is exaggerating for some parts but thats meant to show how the overall state of the game is. and there are only a few skins outside of the gemstore a released into the game, i mean how many skins do we got with the last ls part?
---
At the moment, not that I know of. 
---
However I have hope for the future from a new company called Playable Worlds.
---
It's being led by Raph Koster - the guy was a Lead designer for Ultima Online, the Director of Star Wars Galaxies, and high up working on Everquest 2. Apparently this new studio he's heading up is full of veteran displaced devs and artists.
---
He's talked about what they are working on - a new sandbox style MMO with features they know people have proven to enjoy over the last 20 years. It will be years until release so may lead to a great game, or not come to anything. But it's a faint, distant glimmer of hope.
---
The game let you do now what u did before and better. U were using a third party app.
---
No, you cant. ArcDps is no longer supported by the game. It simply doesn't work anymore.
---
How exactly do you save the builds as text? I did some googling but couldn't find anything.
---
Nope, if you go through the wiki's galleries, the races always have different poses on the same chair - especially asura. It might be that there's a singular *set* of poses, though. But if that's the case, rather than using the generic "medium-sized chair" animations that Legionnaire's uses (same with Emblazoned, Desert King Throne, and Pirate Captain's Chair, likely more), they could have used the same set of animations as Bench of the Final Judge/Luxurious Pile of Gold. Or they could have made a new animation set like Super Adventure Box Chair did (reused for Bough of the Grove - maybe others not yet up on the wiki).
---
Unless they have some rigid rule that says only raid chairs can use that pose set. Which if so would be silly.
---
In my case, Oldschool Runescape. Big nostalgia hit, but also a game with super rewarding progression and a focus on what the communjty wants (polls to decide on content additions need a 75% majority to go ahead)
---
Charr tho.
---
I like the way you're being downvoted for having the audacity to not absolutely hate the build template system. It's really not that bad, it's just overpriced.
---
you seem to be the delusional one.
---
Strangely The Simpsons didn't see this coming. They aren't what they used to be.
---
Gem Wars 2
---
I respect you for deleting it, next time I'd do something like this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/cosplay/comments/dm91pk/photographer_my_daughter_princess_zelda_cosplay/
---
That would require effort.
---
It doesn't help that Arc was slowed down *on purpose* by Anet's demand to have the tool mimic "human-like speed" when switching. So having the inhouse solution be instant is just another kick into the balls for those of us who used Arc.
---
Doesn't excuse downvoting, however.
---
Make sure to not run ouf lube.
---
Just a tick box for "switch to this build automatically when entering pvp/wvw" would be just perfect for me. It's the only thing I miss.
---
The early game is not engaging at all, and personally I found the archer to be boring.   
---
You can try different classes entirely freely in FFXIV on the same character - you change class by changing weapon. It's that easy. 
---
However, personally, the crafting and resource gathering systems are awful, and don't cut it for me. I bought FFXIV at launch, had a few good goes at it, but in the end I don't like it. 
---
Carry on and give it a good go, but yeah. It has problems, like every MMO.
---
yes, atm. and the story aspect of the episode is completely useless cause i play it once and never touch it again
---
NCSoft wouldn't have ahd to step in and squeeze Anet had the company been managed properly.. 
---
They made too many shitty decisions over the years without the help of NCSoft.
---
Also GW1 somehow managed to survive without a single skin in the gemstore, with free builtemplates, and NCSoft greenlit a sequel while funding it for 6 years.. but sure they are somehow evil I guess.
---
Yeah I Did send a ticket, But have to yet get a respond^^
---
There's more to the game than "dress-up simulator" so content-relevant things like templates that are objectively worse than the free add-on we used to have are worth critiquing. 
---
I can't dye back items I'd love to dye, but I'm much more concerned about things that actually affect my performance and enjoyment in the "hit things, get rewards" part of the game.
---
that's pretty non factual. I don't really care if CMs are dead or not since I don't actively play anymore but not investing in things that had varying degrees of positive feedback feels backwards, maybe it's true nobody really plays them.
---
Not having Fractal Ben is something I hadn't considered. He was at least to me a very important asset in what I considered solid fractal development.
---
I’ve been playing GW2 for several years now and this month is the first time I’ve ever heard of arcdps. Maybe it’s because I only PvE. I know what dps is, but what is arcdps?
---
I see a pattern here :thinking:
---
I thought the shared build slots were for that specific reason, To share gear among other characters, what's the point of sharing traits? Do they expect me to run multiple characters from the same class?
---
Shouldn't a gear template system work to prevent that? Rather than encourage that?
---
I'm playing through the game for the first time, currently level 32 and noticed that some pretty decent gear is available through the Karma Vendor at level 40. Should I spend some on this while leveling or save it for whatever else later down the road?
---
So without having to back door it like delta did, with anet’s support they could make it more efficient and smart. The point is delta made a BETTER product for FREE and anet decided to make us pay for a pretty bad version of templates that aren’t even really templates
---
All you need to do is quick swap when out of combat same as everywhere...
---
How many years has Star Citizen been "coming soon" for now? +140mil donated, near a decade in the making, no end in sight.
---
Might not be a valid gw2 alternative
---
You crash the whole map/instance you are on when it happens, surprised that people haven't been abusing this and crash WvW maps etc.
---
Just curious, what is your background and work experience that made you believe this?
---
I'm not anyone famous or have a high paper qualifications, but I've spent the last 9 years working as web and UI/UX designer. Designing and developing based on data alone is **NOT** the way to go from my experience.
---
Data is very important yes. Listening to unfiltered and open feedback is also detrimental yes. However basing designs and development purely on statistics is just another extreme end and is just another big mistake.
---
Statistics do not tell you why things happen, they leave you to make assumptions and unvalidated assumptions are what makes business projects fail. Say you design a revolutionary function, but that function is hidden behind 5 clicks and a loading screen. Nobody uses the function. Is it because no one wants the function? Or they can't find it and don't know it exists? Or is the function just buggy and doesn't work half the time?
---
Instead of listening to random player dissent on the internet, it is a UX designer's job to conduct focus groups, to perform user testing and usability testing to validate assumptions and ideas. Regardless of what business you are in, you are designing and developing for PEOPLE, and you need to conduct the right research and testing to back up your hypothesis on data. Cutting out human interaction is going back eons in design philosophy. Every major tech company is putting big emphasis on UX, that is User Experience. It goes hand in hand with iterative and agile design.
---
The funny thing is I believe that Anet is exactly in this stance of design and develop purely on statistics. Ever since years ago they have completely sealed off outside noise and built things within their own vacuum. Let's think about it; Desert borderlands, guild halls, stronghold - these were all designed and developed into completion with  as far as we can tell, no input from players of any kind, resulting in a finished product that left much to be desired with. And was there post-launch feedback? Yes, lots of it, but where did that end up? Nothing changed. All those features were abandoned immediately, presumably because the data showed that no one played it and thus was no worth fixing.
---
Same can be said about balance patches and discontinuation of certain types of content. 
---
Now going back to build templates. If data is what has driven their decisions in building this, anyone can already see something is wrong. Vast majority of the playerbase does not interact with their builds meaningfully on a frequent basis. Firstly you would be generalize your entire playerbase, and secondly you not understand why they don't interact with their builds.
---
Which leaves us in this state where they have designed something that most players don't really need, albeit they'll take a freebie, and does not solve any problems of players who are most concerned.
---
Bye then.
---
Can I have your gold please?
---
Need it to convert to gems so I can buy template expansions ;-)
---
isn't FF's subscription slightly cheaper if bundled up?, not sure if you took that into consideration.
---
This. 
---
And then they want to whine about how attendance is down.
---
*The hell do you do with toilet paper????*
---
Made the switch a couple weeks back. Wonder if there's a small, "fuck this shit, I'm going to FFXIV" discord?
---
We know the answer to that..they just don't have the bandwidth to do proper testing. And even when we do complain, there are too many white knights that keep telling them it's fine so ANET hears what they want to hear and filters out the rest.
---
again that was an anet imposed limitation. arc templates would load in less than a second in city maps
---
It was 30 minutes, because people kept joining, trying to burst, failing and then leaving after 1 or 2 attempts instead of just doing the fight as intended.
---
I am TOTALLY REEEEING. I logged in and admittedly I'd had a few beers..but My first instinct was  WHAT IS THIS GARBAGE?
---
Too little, too late, for too much.
---
Also what we got wasn't really "templates" so much as "loadouts"
---
Arguably the only templates this system has is the build storage, everything else is a loudout.
---
Free in the prequel and every other MMO known to mankind.
---
800 gems, that's 10 Euros, for one Template slot. A great deal. Where is the trumpets of glorious victory for the guys who thought the system is good enough for that kind of price tag?
---
Imagine giving them cash for this shit? Like rewarding them for a hideous job?? Maybe I can get Mike and Rubi to piss on my face and charge me for it after??? Idk.
---
I don't agree, the official solution should obviously work instantly. They just don't want you to gain an advantage with arc over those who don't have a 3rd party tool like that.
---
lmaooo
---
_cries_
---
maybe its anets fault?
---
&gt;Not an oversight.
---
Yes it is? It means they didn't even try to use revenant utility skills or change them around and see how templates worked with them. Lazy and pathetic.
---
the dll was fine though and literally all you had to do was put them in the bin64 you didn't have to "fiddle with your game dll"
---
People were abusing it last night in NA meta maps. 10s prior to pinata spawning and crashed the entire map, then AB finished and about 10-15s later it crashed.
---
I'm a casual, I don't really know whats going on or what the big deal is? I thought build templates would be a good thing? Is it because they are charging money for them that is the issue?
---
it's actually made mainly pve (raids) in mind
---
What is confusing about it? 
---
It would probably be better received and easier to understand what you have issues with if you actually said what the issue was, rather than just screaming about it.
---
Ewwwww
---
That is ugly. I'm on holiday so have not been able to test any of this but that sounds horrendous.
---
amazing
---
Eternally inconsistent.
---
I used to buy a lot of gems to purchase account upgrades, such as more toon slots, bigger mats storage, more shared inv slots, etc, but after this I've decided I will not spend one more cent on the game, neither will I convert gold to gems to buy anything in the gemstore ever again. One person in the overall scheme of things may not impact Anet's revenue all that much, but I will not financially support a company that not only engages in scummy monetization practices but that also blatantly hates its long-term hardcore customers so much. I work in accounting, and word of mouth is THE biggest thing in the accounting world. If I don't do a job well, not only have I lost out on potential new clients but I may lose current ones too. Realistic customers of Anet aren't advertising the game because they recognise these scummy practices and are actively advising their friends to stay away from the game. How is Anet thinking that this strategy will actually pay off for them? I honestly have no idea.
---
Read it again, I'm on your side. Heck, look at my flair.
---
You did a better test in 1 day than anet in months with this feature. I really wish Betatesting was a thing.
---
Honest question. What is wrong with Legendary Runes? I use them on three different builds without an issue. What am I missing.
---
It's just a fun novelty. Throw it at people!
---
I got a rollback yesterday after claiming extra life mail, was awkward as I had to re-claim it again. Didn't check if I lost anything else.
---
ArcDPS is a plugin DPS meter that can show you your damage as you do it, while also showing you the DPS of anyone in a party/squad with you, it's a great tool for self improvement and management of teams.
---
Up until a couple weeks ago it also included a build templates feature, a free add-on to a free plug-in.
---
He wasn't disagreeing with you, just venting more.
---
It's sad to see build templates, something which players were anticipating more than actual content releases, turn out this way.
---
Looks like the 70's have arrived to Tyria.
---
I know I was concurring. This is the first time in 7 years I'm actually really stunned. It's CRAZY they thought this was a good system..... WHat is that mindset?
---
&gt;BTW thankyou for the downvotes. Your attitude contributes to the death of this game
---
Well, considering that there are multiple critical threads that have a really large amount of upvotes maybe the issue is HOW you say things rather than what you say? It is not like you are actually even trying to be constructive you are just throwing shit.
---
The WoW one was finished. Though it was at the time of he blizzard controversies so he didn't want people missing the point of the video
---
that would at least re-introduce the functionality we lost yesterday...
---
Well I payed for equipment slots, but not for pve, wvw, pvp or raids. I using it for my RP armor which took very much bank and inventory space. For switching RP Armor it is a good system.
---
And how many of these players actually use templates another 5%. Effectivly the number is small. It worked 14 years ago it works now.
---
Sums up why I now play ESO.
---
You can't save equip templates right now, they change / autosave
---
PS Always the 'Feedback' threads are just to keep the comments in one place to ignore.
---
Wondered why my WvW fights were easier than usual last night.  Bet folks didn't read the patch notes or popups.
---
Agreed but why pissing off veterans?
---
Let them use ARC templates: casuals won't bother with add-ons anyway
---
I wish Lootbox mechanics weren't so dangerous for me personally, because legit I adore ESO. ZOS really put their heart and souls into making that game worthy of the Elder Scrolls name- there's a reason it keeps growing and why fans of it are super vocal about loving the title and staff.
---
~~(If they ever add digitigrade Khajiit tho I will main that shit, give me back those ugly ass Morrowind legs baby)~~
---
Ok, will do that
---
Actually, they do have the players to do the testing, at lest for the Grothmar Valley they had.
---
Another idea is to use a precast template or if you're going to precast more than from 1 weapon set use more templates.
---
But yeah whatever solution you will come up it will be just a dirty workaround and not a real solution to the underlining problem.
---
QA at it's finest D:
---
eso combat is comparatively clunky, and characters all look like some radioactive disaster struck the world some time ago, but zone design is pretty cool, mechanics in dungeons and trials are fun (can be skipped with DPS, but mostly in normal mode only), the gearing is a lot more interesting with set bonuses and every class has available tank, heal and 2 DPS builds (1 magika, 1 stamina). there's a meta too, but even there the top and bottom meta builds are like 5% apart. like imagine a DPS necro only being 5% weaker than a DH instead of like 25% or more.
---
all in all, ESO is quite fun for ex gw2 players, but like every other alternative (incl. gw2) there are certain pain points, question is, are those enough to ruin the game for you or can you overlook them. that's something everyone needs to figure out for themselves.
---
that said, eso combat starts at lvl 50, with 160 champion points. then you start to put together gear sets etc and you'll notice a huge difference in damage, sustain and playstyle (for example simply having more resources means a lot spammier rotations).
---
&gt;if arcdps never did build templates, we wouldn’t have had anything to compare this hot mess to
---
GW1 build templates spring to mind.
---
Correct me if I am wrong but wasn’t Hall of Chains post POF? They at least got something right
---
&gt;image macro
---
Continue to ignore this part, I guess
---
Gw2 is cheaper as long as you don't buy extra templates or inventory slots and stuff.
---
&gt; Also on mobile so I could care less about formatting. 
---
Then care less. Or l2english.
---
Anyway since you don't care about formatting I don't care about reading bye.
---
And don't forget about the new Viera race. Bunny girls *and* cat girls.
---
&gt;It's weird because from the sounds of it, most people here still haven't tried it. Mechanically, it works flawlessly. Whoever helped program and design it, literal gods.
---
Yeah. It has been my dream to swap my sword/dagger with a staff and then find them lacking their sigils and infusions when I swap them back. Flawless, literal godlike design and implementation.
---
Well we might get that for PvP later but there is no real reason for PvE/WvW Equipment to be able to share cause the next Person will not have the same Gear.....
---
Also it will allow to avoid paying for Equipment slots and anet wants to make money from it.
---
We don't need a workaround for this, we need a redesign of the system from the ground up.
---
or just use a text editor to copy the templates ...
---
It’s definitely not related to Arc considering I’ve been DC’d a few times last night while setting up the “templates”.    
---
I have zero 3rd party add ons, no mount wheel, no ArcDPS, no nothing.  Just base game.
---
Just use the gear you loot until level 80. Trinkets might be worth the karma while leveling if done sparingly. Don’t go crazy with it. 
---
Karma will be an easy way to get exotic level 80 gear eventually.
---
Odd, our strike went fine yesterday when people swapped builds. I had no idea that this was a bug
---
LOL, I've never heard that one.
---
You are not making sense and admitted being under the influence of alcohol, which may be the reason why you do not understand the templates in the first place and justifies the downvotes in my humble opinion.
---
The system is actually very good, and will help the majority of players who are not hardcore enough to have more than 2/3 builds &amp; gear sets per character. I was quite happy to empty 15 slots of inventory by putting some secondary gear in the second template :)
---
Lol thats basically where I'm at. Im super casual, so all this frustration doesnt really affect me. I never even used arcdps. But I understand their frustration tho, I have sympathy.
---
Anet increased condi and boon stacking and cleansing with their never ending powercreep. Then they try to lower the server tickrate to offset this lag.
---
gw2efficiency.com
---
No you did not.
---
&gt;thats (at 15%) 225,000 players that will run into trouble, and if they replace their computer every 5 years, that's 45,000 issues a year, or 3,750 a month.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Even if I drop that to 3% of users rather than 15,...
---
You estimated 15% and 3% for people that are not happy to move files. My reply focuses on the percentage of those people that can't move files and don't use templates. So 45k x 0.05 / 12 --&gt; 185. You can take it in account beforehand but it's going to be a hard overestimate.
---
Further how many of those can find the support or will even need it? In reality it's another 10% that will bother going through support instead of just reputting their templates.
---
95% of mats can be sold, exotics that can be listed generally you list, rates you check price on TP. The rest you can right click and see if it can be sold on TP via "Sell on TP" if not you can MF it, salvage it, or vendor it. If none of those apply just delete it if its worthless.
---
I'm not going to downvote this because it's a fair opinion but this is also the extent to which this is useful: 2 builds. If your char only roams and zergs, this is fine, hey it is great then. But if you dare to use a wvw char in PvE too, then it's gonna get expensive because you need more equipment slots. And I use my wvw chars for pve to farm lws3 trinkets faster :(
---
You think anet is doing well as a company? 
---
An incompetent company barely surviving off legacy IP is capitalistic, sure.
---
I am 100% sure if reseting traits at release hadn't cost something we would have had real skills+traits templates since day one.
---
Oh i guess you are right. with legendary gear it will work just fine and with a mention of which parts you are missing it's actually a good idea.
---
i haven't been testing skill templates on chars which do not have the required skills unlocked so my bad i guess.
---
Outside of legendary equipment it seems to be a mess tho imagine having the infusion different or having no infusion template gear piece while your actual equipment has one. imagine the template uses ascended/exotic/... stats while your gear uses different rarity of stats etc.
---
You are sure right they can probably do it, but they probably wont cause for those reasons.
---
True, but people will always buy some. And that is why they do this, because they have a Marketing/Finance person that don't care about the backlash since they know in the end it will make money.  Do I agree with that mentality, Hell no !!! But is the reality in the world we live in, everything is about ways to keep that $$ coming in. 
---
Also remember GW2 is not a sub base game, so if you get upset and stop playing this does not directly impacts the profits. They already got your money, they want to find ways to get new ways to make revenue.
---
Right to life is radical now? Jeez.
---
Hi hi so funny great content really showed those negative reddit whiners [Fluff]
---
If only the combat was actually good. If only gunbreaker was dps. If only dancer was a healer.
---
&gt; Oh look, they even tell you where to post them! 
---
Considering that subreddit is dead, it's natural for the memes to be posted here instead.
---
For that matter, **this** subreddit is dead if you take away all the memes as well, since it's what most of the posts are, even when things are looking positive.
---
\-
---
In fact, earlier i asked you:
---
 "Did you complain when people were all praising the concert from last LW episode? Wasn't that low effort too?"
---
And you responded with:
---
"No, because they weren't all image macros with crappy titles"
---
Which is a blatant lie, because most of the posts then were still image macros with "crappy" titles... The only difference was that they were positive memes rather than negative memes... And i didn't see you spamming the comment section back then.
---
So just admit you're a hypocrite. You don't actually care about image macros, you just want to white knight Anet.
---
If you were this defensive about your belief regarding the rules, you would be posting them on the memes praising Anet too... But judging by your comment history, you don't.
---
This isn't the problem. Really dedicated players often don't use legendary armor for all their builds because it's more work than just equipping a pre-configured ascended piece.
---
That does not sound too bad, sadly I have to live off of 44USD (40 euro) a week and food is more important than a new game 😁
---
I also think I'm missing something, I don't get how the "vertical" template UI works with the 1/2/3 templates sheets.
---
Don't mean to be dumb on purpose or salty, but really, I don't get it.
---
devops here, what tools do you use for CI ?
---
i was wondering how you did hotfix and patch to new builds while maintaining previous build for those who were still in game until i started to do the same with teraform &amp; aws vm ;)
---
My major annoyance comes with swapping [legendary weapons](https://i.imgur.com/OXjUKel.jpg) in and out of the templates in-between each other.
---
It does NOT save me time. In fact, I preferred arc over this implementation, considering I need to reset my stats, sigils, and infusions every single time.
---
13 in the past 7 days

r/GuildWars2Funny
---
I agree but they're trading value of their only product for short term cash grabs. This doesnt improve the longevity of gw2, it improves anets current income.
---
Let's see how it works out :)
---
Unless you roam on your PvE set.
---
Arcdps only ever crashed your own game after major updates.
---
Anet templates seem to be able to take out entire map instances...
---
Some of it is people unhappy because they lost a third-party tool, ARC DPS, which showed a raid group's DPS and also allowed you to save and swap builds. This tool was developed with ANet's blessing with the knowledge that it would go away once ANet's version of build templates came into the game. The swapping in ARC was not perfect, but people had gotten used to it and ARC did not have some of the limits that ANet's system has.
---
Some is largely people (rightly, IMO) upset about the price. Equipment templates make sense to monetize, maybe not for 500 gems a pop but still, but the rest feel like they're gouging players and triple-dipping. Obviously it's all optional and, personally, I'm just going to use dedicated alts in the rare cases where I need more builds than I can get by default. But it's still not great.
---
The rest is people getting worked up without thinking (see most of this thread where people laughably say that they'd rather quit than use this system that doesn't stop you from swapping things like you have for the last 7 years) and flailing their arms around ("I just logged out rather than spend a few minutes fixing my traits!").
---
I don't believe this implementation was good willed. Everything about the build template seems to be made around monetization instead of making a system then try to monetize it, they went the other way around.
---
I understand that they intended to make money with templates, they are a business and need the income but this was not the right way to do it.
---
They also had tons of feedback, while most of it was just whining, there was also a lot of very good feedback and suggestions, all of it ignored.
---
&gt;Add a 0 slot called ‘current gear’ 
---
Or just add a "Save" button.
---
You think it's good. Whether I've had a drink or not, the other 30 threads complaining about how shit the system is , is conformation for me. Are they all tipsy too? Either way, im beyond caring. I realised tonight I don't care anymore. That's Anets fault. Btw, if I REALLY cared about downvotes, all i got to do is post a Trump story in r/politics. I'll have 20k overnight because Americans are that easily manipulated 🙄🤣
---
Good, let anet go bankrupt and pray some of their IP gets sold off.
---
More faith in this scenario than anet actually releasing alliances.
---
True, they have my money from previous purchases, but if I continue to play and buy nothing I am now a liability using up resources. F2P games don't last forever being 'free'.
---
I saw another post that put it best, people that would use a template system dislike this one and aren't buying it, the people that don't use a template system don't find any reason to buy this. Not much of a win all around. They might get _some_ sales, but they could get a lot _more_ if they created a system people actually liked and wanted, it isn't like there hasn't been a lot of feedback.
---
If it's not bound to account or a character it means you can sell it.
---
It's not everyone that has this bug, only a few people.
---
This still helps anet. Dont buy and dont play is preferred.
---
Come on now, don't be shy. Kinda odd how you're self righteous and dismissive in every other comment but whenever definitions are posted you stop replying.
---
10/10, would spend gems.
---
One tiny nitpick: in [this screen](https://i.imgur.com/J9S7ajE.png), the boxes to activate a specific template for one game mode should be [radio boxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/radio) instead of [checkboxes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/checkbox) to better communicate that you can only select one per section.
---
&gt;You can set everything up exactly how it was before the patch. You get 3 build templates free, so put your PvP on one, WvW on another, and PvE on the remaining one. Then, it's the same as before the patch.
---
Except they used to switch automatically, which is no longer the case.  
---
&gt; Except... now you have a second equipment template to play with. 
---
Except that I don't, because attempting to do so results in a mess of missing infusions and upgrades because my character is geared with leggies. So it is objectively better for me to manage my equipment manually.
---
I mean using server bandwidth for free doesn't seem like it helps them
---
That's not your definition of dungeon, that is Gw2 definition of dungeon. 
---
If that is yours and true and only definition of dungeon I can claim that ff will never ever have dungeons. Never had never will.
---
What? 500 gems buys you 1 equipment template slot for 1 character, or am I misunderstanding your point?
---
&gt; I don't agree with the annoyance of unlocking waypoints, most people have a enough teleport to friend items that they can just use those to unlock the wp in a reasonable amount of time.
---
I'm pretty sure most people do *not* have 35+ teleports to friends to have at least one wp on every map. Let's say you want/need to make 3 new chars, because you have 3 chars with more than two builds/equipments, that's 105 teleports to friends. 
---
And keep in mind that you only can get them via BL chests or statuettes. Most people don't even do the weekly key farm. 
---
&gt; people still do dungeons?
---
Yes.
---
Imagine ACTUALLY being this pedantic.
---
Hah, thanks.
---
Yeah, the behaviour would be like radio buttons.
---
I had the checkbox laying around and decided not to change it since Photoshop really hates me or the mockup psd somehow and it wasn't worth my nerves.
---
Hit it right on the spot XD
---
I did explicitly state that my 3% was intended to filter it down to people who actually end up having the issue and contacting support. You think the percentage of people is .15%, not 3% and that's fine since neither of us actually know, so we'll have to disagree on that.
---
I have less faith in the base technical skill of a user than you, and that's the end of that discussion, I think.
---
At least they can read them and eat some insults.
---
Surprise mechanics.
---
Why you really want but do not realize you want is for outfits to be split between "Costume" and "Hat" slots, so we can equip them individually and mix them.  
---
If it worked like that, then you could toggle on/off individually hat, helmet and outfit, and get all these possible combinations:
---
* Hat ☑, Costume ☑, Helmet⍰ = Hat + Costume
---
* Hat ☑, Costume ☐, Helmet⍰ = Hat + Armor
---
* Hat ☐, Costume ☑, Helmet☑ = Helmet + Costume
---
* Hat ☐, Costume ☐, Helmet☑ = Helmet + Armor
---
* Hat ☐, Costume ☑, Helmet☐ = Costume only.
---
* Hat ☐, Costume ☐, Helmet☐ = Armor only.
---
All outfits have a version without the hat for personal story cinematics, so that part of the work is done. It's only a small part, but it's done.
---
They would have to make split versions of all the hats (like the Balthazar helmet and Grenth helmet who are already available as helmet skins), put them in a list of unlocked 'hats', then change the UI, sever data and other related code to support hats.
---
But once done, just imagine the possibilities, and how many people would buy way more outfits. Sometimes only for the hat!
---
7k hours here, almost 34k AP.
---
Maining mostly my chrono and I feel bullied by ANet since the last year's nerfs.
---
What I learned through the year is that ANet as a Team is unable to do the job a single guy did out of passion in his freetime. And still they want to be the most greedy with this mess of a system.
---
I feel so jaded to ANet and I hope they receive all the backlash since they've not only being doing bad decisions for a lot of time but also insult us veterans playing the game by ditching our feedback faking it was listened.
---
Yeah the loot boxes are my main gripe about ESO.
---
 I consider myself lucky that I have an aversion to gambling, it's absolutely awful how companies target those that are on the opposite end.
---
With any luck they'll be legislated out of existence, though I remain skeptical.
---
&gt;The more I was testing yesterday the angrier I was.
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
Well as it's a pain to play without ARC template let's just play the market.
---
Relevant flair :(
---
6800 gems to purchase all the upgrades to do something we had for free before. 
---
\~85$ is practically the price of two expansions. Whomever costed this went overboard quite a ways.
---
&gt; I hope Anet actually listens to the feedback.
---
heh
---
Same, but if that training group is practising mechanics on a fairly simple boss yet half the dps cant surpass 5k then its equally hopeless.
---
I've seen people do SH with 2 good chronos and a good pusher that did their jobs... yet the boss doesnt die cause group dps isnt high enough.
---
Dps classes with 5k dps belong with the golem, not in training raids.
---
I am interested.  Only thing is my guild has extreme sentimental value and I'd rather not leave / delete it to join a speedclear one.  You guys have an open slot in your alliance?
---
Besides my many other concerns what is bugging me the most is the following:
---
You can equip a legendary set on all build slots of 1 character, BUT if you want to use that same legendary set on another character you first have to unequip it on EVERY build slot, then move it to bank/shared slots, equip it back on EVERY build slot and then set up EVERY stat for the corresponding slots...
---
ARC was miles faster, just as fast as Anets release, but Anet forced whats his face to put a 500ms delay between actions for quite a few places.
---
How much does each equipment template hold?
---
I think you would need to compare to the number of people that use build templates, not total playerbase. Not all players are using a build template thing.
---
In all honesty, it is well-founded. After they thoroughly ignored tons of relevant feedback and released this feature with all the issues so many players have said are issues.... what else do you expect?
---
Since I got the skyscale, I rarely use the griffin.  It's more versatile in the number of situations and maps it can be useful in.  You can also use the skyscale in many places where you would use the bunny, or oakheart essence, etc.
---
Oh no :(

---
Means: You know what, no, they literally explained the rule right there, you just don't want to understand the rules because you don't like these kind of posts/ they don't share your opinion.
---
I had to delete and reload my build template several times to get my off legend order right, every time I swapped maps in wvw it would switch the order of my off legend skills. Not fun getting into a fight and legend swap only to find my stunbreak is not where I’ve got the muscle memory for it
---
Sigh... ah well I went from playing WvW daily to once every 2 weeks. I've become too numb to care.
---
You people need to understand that only a very minor percentage of the playerbase was using third party templates, and as a general business rule. You try to appeal to the larger audience (same reason raids and some other content types do not get as much releases as generic open world PvE).
---
That said and trying to understand both sides of the argument, yes, it is a bit sad that the 6 slots limitation exists (in time it will be increased, probably to 10), yes, it is sad that it missed the mark on making legendary gear the ultimate QoL (hopefully they will fix this one).
---
But for the monetization part, I am ok with it. It's a company, build templates were developed, developers need to get paid.
---
For a solution for you, you could get multiple revenants, a slot will cost you 800gems, and come with 2 gear and 3 build templates, (along with anniversary gifts and BL keys if you want to spend 2h to get the keys from.PS and map.completion). If you are doing raids and fractals you are probably swimming in Asc gear anyway.
---
All I'm saying is, it is very hard if not impossible to please everyone and still get profit. All and all, my only criticism would be the 2 points I mentioned earlier.
---
Did I not just say using ascended weapons was faster? As it has always been
---
the way build templates was handled was incredibly misguided but they're not activision EA
---
Griffin and skyscale are the only two flying mounts.  There is no "easy" one.  The griffin collection is easier than skyscale though.
---
*Laughs in new character slot*  
---
*Laughs in txt file*  
---
Seriously, for the 800 gems a full new "build" template would cost you (gear and traits) you can get THREE trait and TWO equipment slots on a new character for the cost of some of the leveling scrolls/tomes that the kinds of veteran players who these things should have been aimed at are likely to have in droves.  OFC that doesn't answer for account bound gear being shared across characters.  
---
I'm merely pointing out that both their pricing and implementation were not well thought out on two very simple points that are not so uncommon among people who have been playing a while.
---
Ohhh, you mean inventory slots and not template/build slots, my bad.
---
Yes I know. Without official templates or arc templates switching builds was a shitshow with legendary gear
---
Very insightful. I just wonder why GW2 is not the hot cake of MMos tho.
---
What if it isn't? *shocked*
---
I did this and I am so happy!  Thanks for the tip!
---
I think you could theoretically just avoid buying build templates and instead just storing everything into build storage. Build Storage is slightly cheaper (167 gems per slot vs 300). Given that you get 3 template slots and what 6? Storage slots to start with, each character can essentially have 2 slots dedicated to what they do most often and the third is a more transitory slot that you have to load in on the fly. Obviously this isn't a cure all because some people have a lot of characters, but if you have 9 build storage slots, you can designate 1 build storage per class that tends to get shared between all characters of that class. It does make it relatively cheaper to do build storage, I think I'd much rather cap out those since they are account wide rather than adding build slots to characters.
---
Or am I not getting something right on this?
---
the subreddit is going to the funi maymayers of reddit. abandon ship while you can
---
Seriously, the sub is so salty and negative these days. I'd hate to be a new player trying to wade through all the toxicity around here.
---
Tell the DH not to touch that template or he will crash. Wait for a fix.
---
Sales 101 - we got EXACTLY what they promised.  If you interjected dreams into their description.  That's on you.
---
They could salvage it if they split the equipment storage and the equipment templates. Equipment storage is what you buy with gems and equipment templates are free (at least 10) which uses the gear in the equipment storage. Players with legendary gear wouldn't need to buy useless storage slots this way.
---
"as a casual who only does world bosses and meta trains, i love the templates! i think you're all being big babies!"
---
Patch my notepad.exe, bitches. Alt-tab ftw.
---
The only type of players anet ever empathise with.
---
You seem triggered, calm down a bit buddy.
---
For this franchise in particular, going back 10 years would literally be a massive upgrade as far as build templates are concerned. 10 years ago was in the GW1 days, after all.
---
&gt; Image macros
---
Means:
---
Posts like the OP.
---
An image macro is literally an image with text on it....
---
&gt;you just don't want to understand the rules
---
It really can't be more clear.
---
Just setup the build, then there must be a copy/paste option somewhere (maybe in the right-click context menu) which generates a chat code. Only works for the build templates, not the gear loadouts.
---
well I believe the developers during the guild chat episode said its 60 inventory slots from their point of view.  This is because on legendary gear, they have to treat the runes/sigils/infusions as separate slots so that they can also be equipped into other templates.  
---
But yeah, obviously from the player point of view, it ain't 60.
---
&gt; The development team behind this is incredibly lazy and incompetent.
---
Come on, don't mix up developers will with corporate greed.
---
I stopped playing WvW with the introduction of the warbeast - they gradually removed most things I liked from the gamemode and haven't improved on those points I care about (balance between roaming / small / large scale battles). I also decided I won't buy gems until I enjoy playing the game again.
---
I think the word your looking for is "disgusted" at the sheer childish like tantrum this community is throwing.
---
Its absolutely pathetic.
---
:/
---
I play only PvE and have 4-5 builds that I like to swap between. Gonna just shrink that to 3 and live within the limit anyway.
---
you're not representing the 10% of whales. Those 10% never complains. And no there is no correlation between arc and them since they don't used it, because those are the guys buying everything like infusions through $&gt;&gt;gems&gt;&gt;gold. That's why Anet keep releasing those items. They do not even raid, they also pay for it. They value their time, that's why they use real money into the game to speed up. Not talking obviously about the show off people that doesn"t really have the mean to do that, but who does it never the less.
---
With the "10 dudes" I was referring to the people you were talking about. Those who are actively trying any combinations of build/stuff to min/max dps output. SC and QT people. People just using their builds and their discord are consumer of their work, and that's it. For them sure, it will be harder to pull out new top dps ranking. Don't even know if it's still a thing though, before it was on reddit, and it's been months that it wasn't in hot/top posts. Either they stopped or they are downvoted to oblivion. Which means templates won't even hurt them.
---
If you are registered in gw2efficiency some specific tabs will tell you for how much you'll be able to sell items. For example material storage https://gw2efficiency.com/account/materials
---
Same thing for bank
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/account/bank
---
Whatever is account bound will have a label saying so, everything else will have a label saying the selling price for the quantity of material.
---
The fact that you don't understand what I meant is very sad.... The issue is that anet did not test it properly before shipping it
---
Cool I really needed that bag space. I only have 320 bag slots after all that time.
---
Technically those codes already exist because you can copy your gear from a template to another, you just can't paste it in chat.
---
That's actually clever. I wonder how fast until they patch it out. Also, a shame gear templates can't be linked like that. Would also help because I'm sure you have different gear set ups for all those builds.
---
NICE! EPIC.
---
Doesn't mail auto-delete after a while? Like 30 days or something... or was that system neve in-place for Guild Wars 2? I'm also not sure if chat codes work in mail anyways.
---
yeah but we did this because we didn't have a build templates system
---
Gods no, they'd ruin it.
---
So does this mean there is going to be a handy dandy list of build chat links to paste into the game?
---
People complained about that? Damn...
---
One could argue this implementation of templates holds players back from reaching their true potential. When a certain skill-ceiling with a certain build/prof is reached, all that is left to get better ( besides golem grinding) is excessively min-maxing. This means changing traits, weapons, armor, sigils, etc for almost every encounter to provide you with the most optimal combination on order to pursue perfection. With unlimited templates and actual build-saving, Arc provided this. For a lot of people, trying to reach this type of perfection with their class and build is endgame.
---
Now you are limited to six templates, and that is after you have already forked out money to pay for the feature. Every time you make a minor change, the template also changes, meaning you have to manually swap everything you changed out before trying any other template or combination. It is so easy to ruin the limited templates you have this way i would argue that it would almost be better to have no templates at all-in this state.
---
To me it feels like a system designed to monetise agressively, not as a QoL for the players.
---
TL;DR: Badly implemented, monetisation is greedy,and it restricts you when it comes to true min-maxing, telling you its better to not improve yourself beyond a certain skill-threshold unless you like getting frustrated. And thats without even referencing all the bugs floating around.
---
Disappointing.
---
&gt; I mean, your PvE, PvP and WvW build got mapped to the free 3 build templates
---
What about my other 8 characters?
---
That's my biggest gripe. Bad monetization I can live with by simply avoiding the store. But they took away a base feature and are charging me to buy a worse version of it back at a ridiculous price.
---
While I agree with the general point, isn't the argument actually that legendary armor sucks and that maybe they should fix legendary armor? I've always taken issue with legendary armor. I understand the convenience that people got out of it, but overall there wasn't a lot of point to the legendary stuff. Weapons had cool foot trails and sounds and stuff, but armor just was the convenience factor so seemed broken to me from the get go.
---
I'm still pretty sure you had a limit. Just no one reached it. It's like with screenshots. That had a limit of how many screenshots you could save and all of that was stored into a folder just like templates.
---
I'm playing The Witcher 3 atm and it's amazing! I'm even playing on the hardest difficulty.  Prior to this I was playing Bioshock Infinite with all DLCs. It's really nice to finally deal with that Steam backlog :D
---
Well I certainly hope they add it soon.
---
I also am a super casual, but I can’t get behind this change. I play pvp and pve, but not super intensely on either. That said, I was excited at the idea of being able to swap builds quickly. I’m a ranger main, and every once in a while I play fractals as a Druid healer. As such, I have:
---
1) my pvp build
---
2) my healer druid
---
3) my open world build
---
Problem is, my open world build is super fluid. What I use when I’m doing big group content is very different from what I do in story missions. Sometimes I change things up cuz I want to, or cuz I need to. Templates could have been great cuz I could swap some skills, do my thing, then press a button to get back to “default” pve build- except I can’t, cuz every change I make gets auto saved into that template. 
---
Worst of all, I’m almost done with my Vipers gear, and I don’t have a way to use condi easily with this change...
---
That sounds SO counter productive on their part.
---
Also you have to pay for the broken sauce and broken condiments
---
Sire you can use the taco without condiments nor sauce but you shouldn't have to pay for those
---
Gotta shrink it to 2. The “active template” auto saves any changes you make, so you can only quick load 2 builds
---
Despite all of our shitposting, and complaints (including mine), I still feel pretty bad for Anet. They've tried to listen (kinda) to the players and give them what they want, but end up botching it and making everyone mad/sad etc. It's almost like everything they try do from strikes to build templates has just been a let down after let down. 
---
I wonder what morale is like over there. It's not that their ideas are all bad, it's just the implementation at.. Just like their outfits.
---
To make it as simple as possible; it would be cheaper to just buy a new character and stick three of the builds you can't fit on your main with hopefully two gear sets that work well with them than it is to buy the necessary gear and build template slots.
---
So something that was free and unlimited in GW1 they now want to charge for in GW2. It is sad at how greedy Anet has become. I know they aren't the worst company out there but they are not nearly as good as they once were.
---
What was the point of doing a stream to preview it a full month in advance if they weren’t going to take any feedback into consideration though?
---
Ya :/ I've at least slotted those 3 in build storage anyway
---
Hi i'm new to guild wars. I'm levelling up a 9lvl Ranger-Paragon. And i would like to find new friends with to play. I usually guest around Kamadan. But I'm open to new dungeons and such :)
---
Well what do you expect when one of the longest awaited features is driven not only into the ground, but drilled to the magnacore?
---
the most prominent one is that you can not mix exotic runes with legendary ones. the UI will correctly display what bonuses *should* apply, in reality however the game treats them as two distinct sets of runes.
---
e.g. with 4 exotic scholar runes and 2 legendary ones you'd get:
---
- (1): +25 Power.png Power *x 2*
---
- (2): +35 Ferocity.png Ferocity *x 2*
---
- (3): +50 Power.png Power *x 1*
---
- (4): +65 Ferocity.png Ferocity *x 1*
---
- (5): +100 Power.png Power *x 0*
---
- (6): +125 Ferocity.png Ferocity; increase damage by 5% while your health is above 90%. *x 0*
---
They won't because they're scared of random snowflakes to cry about getting gear shamed or something. Yeah they care more about that than making everyone else happy by having a proper system.
---
I agree with your statement, but an 'upgrade' that a player doesn't need, and gets for free, is ofc 'well received'.
---
But was that worth antagonizing that small minority who did use Arc templates?  The players for whom build swapping is of reasonable importance?
---
It would be like if ANET re-introduced some older exclusive mini pet and gave one for free to all players.  The majority of players would be happy (well received) as most players don't care too much about minis, but those die hard collectors who had to do whatever to get it originally would be peeved as hell that what they worked hard to get, was given away freely to everyone else.
---
Not quite the same situation, I get it, but my point is: giving free stuff to a large group of people who don't want/need it is hardly a sound strategy if at the same time you're pissing off a small group of people the would want/need it.
---
Those who don't care about templates won't remember the 'free' update they got on Tuesday, because it doesn't impact them, but for those who did use Arc heavily, they will never forget.
---
Either way it doesn't matter to me - just commenting on what I'm observing :D
---
Well but wasn't that the case BEFORE templates? Any change was set in, there wasn't ever an undo button or a save button to apply.
---
Ah okay, so if you save builds in the storage they don't autosave?
---
&gt; Despite all of our shitposting, and complaints (including mine), I still feel pretty bad for Anet. They've tried to listen (kinda) to the players and give them what they want, but end up botching it and making everyone mad/sad etc. It's almost like everything they try do from strikes to build templates has just been a let down after let down.
---
That's sort of the problem though isn't it? They half listen to what people want, then implement it in a bubble, and then when people say it's not what they needed/wanted ANet goes *shocked pikachu face*.
---
Did arc build template change your equipment for you? I discovered the addon when it was about to stop working :/
---
The complaints are, by and large, players who got used to a third party program and its template functionality and now can no longer use that functionality because, as per an agreement with the maker of that third party program, it has been removed due to the official implementation of build templates.  Since you never used that third party program, presumably, most of the complaints don't apply to you.
---
For the rest of your questions...
---
If you logged in during a Living World release, you unlocked it even if you don't own the expansions, you just won't be able to play it (besides LS2) until you buy the related expansion.  If you performed an achievement in the core world after the expansions were released that would give a mastery point, that mastery point will be waiting for you once you buy an expansion.
---
It's uncertain what kind of sale might be on for Black Friday.  There would normally be something, but a new system was just introduced where buying Path of Fire gives you Heart of Thorns for free, so they might decide that's enough sale for everyone.  You can still find better deals on Path of Fire (w/Heart of Thorns for free) at other official retailers sometimes.
---
You will earn several mounts for free playing the story, yes.  The Raptor, Springer and Skimmer are all picked up as you progress the story.  The Jackal and Griffon are also available with just base Path of Fire.  Jackal costs a smaller amount of gold, Griffon requires a lengthy chain of collections and a lot of gold to unlock.  Living World Season Four has two more mounts as well, the Roller Beetle in Episode 3 (requires some collections, but not too much gold) and the Skyscale in Episode 6 (actually requires all episodes to obtain, and a lot of legwork, but less gold than the Griffon overall).
---
Griffon and Skyscale are the two flying mounts.  Griffon operates somewhat like the Super Mario World cape, you can gain incredible speed by diving and maintain your altitude pretty well going forward, but you can't really gain height beyond your starting point.  Skyscale operates instead like a helicopter, able to hover in place and to gain height, but the farther you go from your starting point the less "flight juice" you have, which will eventually cause the mount to tire and begin to descend.
---
&gt; To properly add a post launch feature you gather player data and shoot for a baseline that would have the largest impact. In this case, I am sure Anet collected telemetry on how often people change traits, how often they change gear loadouts and how much extra gear they carry around.
---
That really isn't a sufficient exploration of the situation though. If you want to add something that makes an action easier or more appealing, then you cannot base yourself on the existing situation specifically because said action is currently difficult or inconvenient. People don't switch builds that much because switching builds is a pain. You can't use that data to predict how much people will actually use build templates.
---
Archeage Unchained just got released.
---
its mostly focused on PvP aspect and Sandbox feel, but theres actual living world in there, so thought I comment and mention it.
---
oh the irony, anet releasing "build templates" is the reason for less variety in builds
---
It is probably true. [https://twitter.com/that\_shaman/status/1189463074572570624](https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1189463074572570624)
---
Okay, so it doesn't suck now compared to before, but sucks compared to yout hopes and expectations. This is an understandable disappointment, but aside from the lack of auto swap on game mode change, it isn't worse than before.
---
As a sort of workaround, the account storage actually works like a template rather than a loadout, so you can use that to manually save overwrite like you would expect a template to work.
---
You may also consider a third party build manager. There are several around.
---
I'm no Chrono but even if some builds have some stats in common the system is so annoying to manage because how it works it makes the whole purpose of it pointless. If you count only stats that I'd need loadouts for it's literally impossible to have loadouts for all my guardian builds: 
---
-DH Power (Berserkers || Scholar Runes)
---
-FB Condition (Griving, Sinisters, Vipers Mix || Balthazar Runes)
---
-FB Power Quickness Raid (Berserkers, Diviner || Thief Runes or Eagle Runes)
---
-FB Power Quickness Fractal (Berserkers || Scholar Runes)
---
-FB Condition Quickness (Full Viper || Firebrand Runes)
---
-FB Heal Raid (Harriers || Monk Runes)
---
-FB Heal Fractal (Harriers or Minstrels depending on a group || Monk Runes or Pack Runes)
---
-FB Support WvW ( Minstrels || Monk Runes)
---
-DH Roamer WvW (Marauders, Berserkers  ||  Fireworks Runes)
---
-FB Support PvP ( Menders || Flock Runes )
---
-FB Symbolbrand PvP ( Menders || Traveler )
---
-Core guard PvP ( Marauders || Lynx Runes)
---
Don't let me get started on weapons and infusions...
---
I mean you have to move the legendary like that before template.
---
That's been my big issue. Crafted legendary armor to use between characters. I usually hop on daredevil for daily gathering, then switch to holosmith for fractals and wvw. 
---
With the new system, unequiping destroys all of the equipment builds. Every single one has to be re-created every time account bound pieces are moved. Anet has basically destroyed the way account bound items are meant to be used.
---
I think that they don't bother to read that.
---
You're clueless. Having a huge amount of ascended gear isnt rare for dedicated raiders. It's a byproduct of raiding. I've got more ascended sets than characters.
---
But plenty, especially anyone dedicated or into tbeorycrafting still uses leggie armor. Even tpot still has legendary armor. If you craft leggie armor, you always have several ascended set.
---
I get that from your 2 build pov, wed already have more ascended than we know what to do with. Frankly that's true, because without permanent bank access you cant carry around enough ascended sets just to play all the variants of heal and burn FB as well as power DH on one guardian. But with leggie armor and arcdps, you have all of them.
---
the implementation is late. but its design is good if you know how to use it.  active one is a reference of tabs is a little bit confused for most of us.  it may be better active one is separated from tabs with a checkbox Autosync
---
&gt; hey told us build storage was for saving a build for another character to access later.
---
That's exactly what it is. 
---
&gt; Typical uses being a transfer between two of your own characters or saving a build linked in chat that's for a different class.
---
Yes, that's what you can do with the build storage.
---
&gt; It wasn't advertised as, and really shouldn't be, the only way to properly save a build.
---
Yes, it was advertised exactly this way, all the time. 
---
The other two features, the equip and build slots were *always* advertised as live-builds. As a 2nd/3rd/4th... slot of the equipment/build panel you already know. 
---
They described them this way in their very first announcement, they even *showes* and explained exactly this to us in their livestream. People even asked about this within stream. The whole system works exactly as advertised. 
---
&gt; the only way to properly save a build.
---
Depends on your "properly". You are able to copy/paste build codes directly into/out of your build tabs without using the build storage at all. So a simple text file of a guild message will do the same job.
---
Yeah I mainly only included it b/c the person I replied to didn’t include a link to it.
---
But yeah, their development model seems problematic, they seem to put an immense amount of time into developing new spaceships and not enough into actually building a game and game world.
---
The other three are all in good shape though.
---
This is the Guild Wars 2 subreddit, you'll have better luck getting replies at r/GuildWars which is for the previous game.
---
We don't have Paragons in Guild Wars 2.  Except as enemies in Istan... but I probably shouldn't get into that. ;)
---
What's wrong with the combar?
---
Yes, and it could re-start legendary items as well.
---
Anyone that wanted had a template system that was superior over the current one.
---
Yes, it was possibile to store an infinite number of builds and it was capable of switching anything for you. With anything i mean: equipment (weapons, armor, trinkets) runes/sigil and stats in case of legendaries, traits, skills
---
You can't do it from your inventory anymore, but you CAN do it from the equipment screen. Even gear in other templates shows up there. You do not need to swap around to find it.
---
Only if you have more than 10 emails stored I think.
---
It's refreshing, right?
---
I'm surprised by how much free time I have now, it's almost scary.
---
The exception is that EA would have had unlimited build templates and equipment templates but instead of 300 gems and 500 gems they would have been 3000 gems and 5000 gems.
---
Move items to inventory, open Trading Post sell tab, sort by Price
---
&gt;Agony Resistance should have worked more like luck, with an account-wide increasing property, but still capped by the pieces of ascended gear you have equipped. So to get 150AR or more, all of your gear would have to be ascended or legendary.
---
You get 18 infusion slots with 15 +9 and a tear of Alba you have exactly 150. Yes that means you can leave your weapons blank and have 1 armor piece exotic or the backpiece not infused.  
---
Since you can start fractals without any AR i really don't mind the system they have now. Especially for ppl that do that content for longer they will eventually get their account wide 45 AR and only need the extra 105AR which are 12 Slots with +9 or less
---
&gt;The WvW infusion bonuses would be better as a WvW ability that gives those bonuses based on ascended gear equipped.  
---
Stat bonuses in infusions could be instead upgrades for trinkets after they introduce level 500 jeweler.
---
This sounds like a really really bad idea for a few reasons:
---
1. first of all not everyone runs the exactly same stat infusion on each gear piece
---
2. secondly imagine a legendary trinket which has all the possible different infusion options on top of the normal stat as well we have 7 normal stat infusions (8 wvw ones which we do not count) so take all of the possible stat comps we have now take them times 7 and you have the new possible amount of stat comps on trinkets. (meh)
---
3. at last we could use different WvW infusions as well makes the account system for those awful as well
---
&gt;And the visuals would be better as a new "Visuals" tab in which players can unlock and select new visuals crafted with infusions and consumables. Then you'd be able to equip them in a series of slots in the Visuals panel, with some limits on how they can be stacked.
---
This is the thing i would like to have but im not really sure if it would be a good idea:
---
1. it would allow as to stack visuals with the same stat (you could fix that a different way tho)
---
2. it solves the problem for ppl who swap their precious chak egg sac/confeti/etc between chars
---
3. we can have the visual even tho we want a different stat than we have the infusion for (yey)
---
Problem is:
---
it kinda devalutes the infuions some ppl will buy the infusions for different chars so they don't have to swap them. Some ppl will have the same infusion with different stats so they can use the correct stat for what they are doing. So also no reason for them to have 2 infusions anymore.  
---
Ye i wouldn't mind the infusions to be cheaper but for a lot of ppl it's the only endgame grind they are doing nowadays cause they have the skins they want and only want the infusions now. With that system the price will definitly drop by some amount so suddenly a lot of ppl achieve their goal and wonder what they could do now, just to realize they have finished the game.  
---
Also it keeps devaluting legendarys even more (which the templates did enough by now) cause if you don't have those you don't even have to pay the fee to remove the infusion anymore.
---
With a workaround that you need to have enough "slots" on a legendary you want to use the effect with and you can only use it with the correct stat it will probably solve this. Or you have it only on one ascended piece and have to pay a fee to remove it from there would probably solve that problem.  
---
This system see not quite user friendly tho.
---
My biggest concern of your ideas remains to be the stat thing on the trinkets the other critic is mainly nitpicking and the 150AR thing just remains a personal Opinion which you don't have to agree on.
---
MMOs are dead. A variety of reasons...
---
If you build a large immersive pve world, that is a huge investment. And it needs constant updates. Not sure if that pays off, its rather risky thus unlikely.
---
In the past mmos had less competition from other genres and games. They had much wider player audiences. Now, unfortunately, the audience not only shrinked but also shifted in a direction.
---
Mmos also completely failed to innovate. When it comes to many popular concepts in game design mmos are years behind. Gw2 was actually ahead and innovative on release. Too bad the shifted audience pushed it back.
---
Quite happy actually!
---
Expect for one thing... character-bound upgrades. Was expecting everything to be account-wide (not just the build storage), so I could buy all the rest of locked skill/trait and gear template tabs once for entire account... not for every single character separately... not sure about that.
---
That's hardly a fair comparison though. Builds worked much differently in GW.
---
When the system is made of issues is it an issue or a system at that point?
---
Guild message apparently has a cap! I tried to get the builds for all of my characters on a the motd and I couldn't get passed my 3rd character :(
---
Gw2 wouldn't survive until anet goes full EA. Their marketing isnt good enough, theyd be bankrupt before that point.
---
Remember when a game's reason for existing was to spark joy in it's user, rather than to suck money out of them?
---
The fractal potions make a lot of builds double up if you care to optimize for them, because of the precision and concentration they give you, you can tune your gear to have more dps.  All of this comes down to whether or not you care. But if you do fractals regularly, you probably want all the dps you can get to quickly phase.
---
boons/dps raids
---
boons/dps fractals
---
boons/heals raids (if your a fractal healer, who cares to optimize)
---
power dps raids
---
power dps fractals
---
condi dps raids
---
I see 6 pretty obvious choices that could apply to mesmer,guard,rev. But I don't know if every class has to change fractals vs raids.  Some power classes cap without any extra help from gear etc.
---
Ye the exception is that in FF you it is required to play the game in gw2 it isn't required to get them on every single character. also ffxiv has alot of microtransactions with a sub fee on top of that.
---
yeah, many people are doing this, but what about the equipments? Now we found a way to save the trait builds, but the most annoying problem is still how to sabe the equipments if you use, for example, legendary stuff and switch among your characters?
---
I dont feel bad for them, its kind of expected after 5+ years of exceptional incompetence.
---
No but sarcasm is designed to invite aggression.
---
Hopefully you will at least try to understand the "subtle" difference.
---
The only point in that can be considered controversial is the final point you can take people being upset about something and call it drama or controversy.
---
Yes Reddit does like outrage, but stop gaslighting criticism of the game.
---
That's how i feel. I was looking forward to making a Power Beast build, keep my Condi Beast build, and have a Harrier Druid build for group pve stuff. It was truly a punch in the sweet spot to find out that the character bound templates were just pve, pvp and wvw mode lots. I mean really?!? I feel like Anet downgraded Pvp, WvW, and all the Legendarys in one single patch with Arcdps the only other option to fix their fuck it. And I've played this game since launch and never ever had a reason to use add-on until now.
---
It is correct, because in the past leggie armor saved space and could be used for as many builds as you liked.
---
Now you can either do builds manually, or use leggie armor as if its ascended armor and not gain any space.
---
Pretty sure that design philosophy was outdated like decade and half ago.
---
My personal guess is, that they have set too high a standard for themselves.
---
Their releases are fucking insane. The amount of detail is off the charts, it's fully voiced, always, and has half a dozen storylines per map. Huge collections, entirely new mechanics, a map with every update, having to juggle 15 gamemodes and content types, ...
---
It's ridiculous.
---
The second problem is that they're frightened to death of limiting themselves. They sucker in raiders with shitty 2006 era raids, then barely support them. They work up an entirely new system for WvW - only to kill it off and bury it in obscurity. Why start that shit in the first place? To keep people around. Yes, you get a broader audience, but they are not going to be happy to be fed scraps. And instead of straight up declaring that they will NOT be able to support ultra hardcore niche parts of their community that do ONE thing and ONE thing only (except casually playing open world), they try their hardest to keep them around no matter how toxic the relationship becomes.
---
And lastly, Anet is *hilariously* bad at community work. That desaster with their Saga event at the cinema? It's like they don't even live in the same plane of existence than their players anymore. How can they be that bad? By having zero consistency. Everyone with half a brain could've seen that debacle coming, but Anet went blissfully unaware into it.  
---
Or maybe they didn't walk into it blissfully unaware, maybe suits made them do it, which would explain that horrendous sales pitch in the end and why everyone looked so uncomfortable and forced.
---
Which leads me to my bonus point: having far more suits up their necks than ever before.
---
I hope this template mess will serve as a lesson to Anet to not allow in good faith addons such as arcdps build templates in the future. A considerable amount of people in this subreddit think they are entitled to everything for free. At this point, I wish Anet stopped any development for Guild Wars 2 and just switched to maintenance mode because it is evident at this point that no further monetisation will come from this game.
---
I agree. They see the trend and realise they should do some exit scam cashgrabs sooner rather than later.
---
Come back when you also do jumping puzzles and rp.
---
500 gems and enough particle effects to light you up like the Fourth of July 🇺🇸
---
I... I bought one for the title...
---
I think it's important for anet to see feedback like this versus going silently. They put out a bad product and act like this is the Christmas present we've been asking and asking for, when it's actually worse that not having it at all. If anet expects us to pay top dollar for this it's insulting, frankly.
---
Wasted potential intensifyes.
---
Yeah as a semi-hardcore player it's been going downhill for a few years now, and this just makes it really difficult to play for me. I am also so upset at not just this but other aspects and it just feeling in general like Anet does not care about me, and it's true, they do not. I'm fine with that but I never expected I would feel like this where I feel completely unhappy and upset. 
---
It's bizarre.
---
It's a visual bug with legendary gear. AFAIK there is no **known** dupe method or risk of deleting infusions.  
---
It's pretty simple. Save 2 equipment slots with the same legendary. Remove said legendary from slot 1. Voila! Your gear is still slotted with infusions in slot 2 while they are put in your inventory at the same time. Looks like they duplicated but they really aren't. The infusions and runes/sigils are only equipped in slot 1. The only bug here is the auto-unequipping of gear upgrades.
---
DoN't yUo GuYs hAVe GeM$?
---
What the Heck are you talking about???
---
Have you seen the official forums? The feedback has been consistent: people think they’re Awful.
---
Teapot doesn't have legendary armor on his necro because he doesn't want to get provisioner tokens. You talk about people and playerbases while having no clue of anything. Stay in DR at the minstrels waypoint, you are save there.
---
What is 
---
&gt;PvE Nomad Megacarry Herald
---
?
---
he is referring to the Teapot comment:
---
That does not change the fact that arc\_templates broke the ToS and only were tolerated but never allowed.  
---
arc\_templates broke the ToS in Terms of 1 click did more than 1 action.  
---
This time it will work for the builds cause you can just copy the code to clipboard outside the game and paste it ,which you probably can do in 1 action (yay)  
---
The Equipment templates are not saved in your clipboard (the copy and paste save) but somewhere in the game files. So if you would be able to extract that you could paste that as well but you would probably break the ToS in terms of manipulating the game files by pasting the code (D:)
---
how does running fractals take care of selling stuff in your bank/inventory/mat storage that you already acquired?
---
You're acting like the toxicity is justified. 
---
I don't think comments like "I can't wait for this game to die" are helpful, and aren't justified.
---
Simple, isn't it? Use the TP.
---
Wasn't he supposed to quit?
---
You know what we need? An equipment wardrobe. Let people store equipment pieces just like you store skins. Obviously, whenever you store a piece, it gets destroyed. Everything gameplay should be easily translatable into a template code.
---
Then implement templates for skins as well, so people can design their own outfits. This is where the real monetization should have gone, into "skin templates" where people can save and share skin setups, and also swap between them quickly. This new system would replace transmutation altogether, and let people purchase new "custom outfit" slots to swap between in exchange of gems.
---
Want more? Add swimsuits to the goddamn game already, and make them replace underwear. Even more? Combat tonics of famous characters, including custom voice lines (Imagine playing as Joko, talking like Joko).
---
ArenaNet is just plain retarded, that's how it is.
---
You are assuming most people voice their opinion, the majority of the playerbase doesn't voice their opinion unless it is to complain. Doesn't take a genius to understand it.
---
And as I said, third party build templates are still allowed, don't know what people are still bitching about, use whichever you want. Can't get any better than that.
---
Ahaha aha- what. Source?
---
while funny, u shuldnt trivialize that players are upset for a REAL reason
---
again - this funny - but it makes it seem like players are looking for a raisen to justify why they are upset, when the truth is that anet poorly added build templates and players are rightly calling them out on it
---
First of all, I already maxed out on bag slots to store all the gear. I don't need the equipment templates to be bundled with extra bag space. I just need the feature to equip certain items from my inventory to my character.
---
A potentially great update being implemented in a terrible way, with zero regard for feedback leading to disappointment? Anet has years of experience with that.
---
The changes and implementation being defended by whiteknights and casuals that never even cared for the feature to begin with? Years of experience with that too.
---
If this similarity is unexpected for you, its because you haven't been paying attention. Dont worry, neither has anet.
---
Got enough of these crap threads.
---
Oh, so he doesn't save inventory space with this new system? You're saying I'm wrong when I say that he doesn't use legendary armor for all of his builds?
---
A company wants to make money? The bastards!
---
Aren't “templates“ disabled when you are not in spawn?
---
I wish they would stop trying to hype up small releases like this. Just release it to surprise us so we have less hype to be disappointed with
---
I have a Condi build and a power build. A better and quicker use would probably be to have one build for cutting down small enemies and one for world bosses, champs, and bounties.
---
I like gw2 but fuck anet trying to turn it into a creepy cross breed between a glorified single player and a p2w mobile trash game every time I dare look away for even a second.
---
why does OP need to run fractals before selling stuff he already has on the tp?
---
Along with their dreaded "merged" threads to keep conversation focused of course... : ^ )
---
Yes. On characters where I don't have legendary armor. Just like everyone else.
---
Use the TP beforehand.
---
Grow up kid.
---
I honestly wish. Id prefer to use as few second party programs as possible.
---
No. It is completely different armor. If I can figure out how to record I will share what happens.
---
Lol. Imagine designing such trash
---
Sure. I think my suggested point levels are just that - suggestion. Anet has all the data, so they could better gauge the appropriate level to give the rewards.
---
If you're talking about the actual add-on, here's the link : https://github.com/Friendly0Fire/GW2Radial
---
So you are upset that they let you have and use free Arc templates for years and now you can't. What a shame. 
---
Please explain why it's predatory as well.
---
You are complaining about having to take minutes to change builds...the horror!
---
I am here to help though, I'll solve your problem. Buy another character slot and split the builds between them. wvw / pve.
---
Price is only a small part of the problem. (though maxing slots for 9 classes does cost about 400 USD which is retarded)  
---
    
---
The biggest "fuck you" according to me is that even if i wanted to, I ACTUALLY CAN'T BUY ENOUGH SLOTS FOR MY REVENANT.
---
"I'm green-lighting this due to the developer's trustworthiness after months of interaction and willingness to add key restrictions and functionality changes to accommodate my push to keep addons away from becoming a "must have to win" situation (WvW restrictions were not outlined in his post, but they are there along with others)."
---
Direct quote from the Dev who worked with Delta in order to get ArcTemplates released 2 years ago.
---
So it's not cool with an AddOn, but if you pay for, you may have advantages over your enemy.
---
Oh how far this game has fallen
---
everything is target/animation based instead of physically based. For example, if you cast a spell successfully it automatically hits the target no matter what. If the enemy is behind a wall, you can’t cast the spell to begin with. There is no skill dodging except for telegraphed attacks. Also, a lot of skills share a global cool down and can’t be used in quick succession; the game paces combat for you. In gw2, skills have a physical location. An arrow can be fired, and then dodged by moving behind an object after it is fired.
---
Obviously you've never played gw2.
---
100 dollars a year is less than I pay blizzard for wow.
---
Not true at all. For example Clash of Clans has been incredibly successful and it is all about sucking money out of customers. Another obvious example are the various online casinos.
---
You can't be serious. Holy shit, this company...
---
The Build templates are a hot mess without the monetization. The fact that Equipment and build templates are delinked is ??? and the fact that you cant have more than 6 (which has no monetary sense, so is more or less a coding/implementation issue) is also baffling. And lets not forget the crashes and co. coming with the update yesterday. 
---
Also, excluding monetization from the build templates debate is outright stupid. Its a _major_ factor in how the usage of build templates is defined (aka very limited. 3/2 are barely and improvement). Its like saying that phones are bad because their batteries dont work. Not like you can enjoy phones without batteries, and you cant "enjoy" the build templates without being harassed to buy more of them. Furthermore, the whole shit is aimed at "Anet" and not at "Devs of Anet". 
---
Maybe youre the one who needs to act like an adult ;)
---
and you pay a monthly sub for constant high quality content plus for not having MTX that is priced awfully, sub fee monetization is by far the best system for both players and the company
---
No clue what he's talking about. 
---
GW2skills.net allows you to play around with builds. It had a build editor page (http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/) which allows you to chose your class, your specialisations, skills, weapons, stat combinations, runes, sigils and food/utility effects. It will then tell you what your stats (power, precision, concentration, expertise etc...) are. 
---
From there you can generate a quick link so you can share or save your build. 
---
Overall, I find this a really useful resource. 
---
You can now also create GW2 chat links from builds you make, to be used in game, or copy GW2 build chat codes from the game and paste them into the site to load up.
---
You did have to have all that equipment in your inventory all the time in order for it to work though
---
One LE episode every 3-4 months, that can be completed in a few hours is HARDLY actual content. So yea I’m looking you in the eye. Unless you call the new flashy BL skins, outfits and toys content. In which case I really don’t know what to say to you, enjoy your content?
---
Oh.
---
\^ i keybind my mounts to my naga mouse, an my utility skills or fkey skills to my naga mouse. never used the wheel b4.
---
Playing Devil's advocate here but doesn't Anet get a tax write off from this? And if so maybe some people are not donating for that reason with the latest string of Anet drama...or they don't want karma boosters. 
---
Idk just a thought.
---
Have they ever done that?
---
You are smart.
---
God damnit. I need more popcorn. This is a great October horror show.
---
Welcome to the real world where people and companies want to make more money. As much money as possible actually. You are living in fantasy land if you think that any large corporation isn't going to milk you for every penny they can. NCSoft (not that I think they are the root of all of this) came in and said you aren't making us enough money. Stop wasting your time and resources working on these other IP(s) and get back to GW2 your cash cow.
---
Good. Can't wait.
---
And they'll ban anyone who actually posts real criticism
---
I may or may not have crashed the wvw map I was on. I joined my guild raid and so swapped stuff when I entered. Game crashed when i tried it, and then I noticed everyone else had crashed. They were taking a keep.
---
Uhh.... it was like that when I got here?
---
Giving out some of it for free does not solve the disfunctionality of the implementation.
---
* Per character
---
* Per mount
---
* Per skin
---
Also you need to unlock the keyboard key you wish to use, but at least that's an accountwide unlock
---
Hold on ... wait for it..,, how many people will pay for it ?
---
Remember to ban GW2 Radial first !
---
Not, I didn't. I also didn't spend money on those things. But those are all cosmetic in nature. Build templates are a fundamental QOL feature that I really missed from the first game. I was annoyed that it wasn't in GW2 but was able to live with it, I'm a bit of an altoholic anyway so it didn't affect me much. Then they announced they were official working on templates so I was excited for that. I assumed we'd get something similar to what GW1 had with maybe some added bonus functionality like equipment templates. What we got was just a horrible design and a tripple dipping of monetization. So yeah, up until now all of the monetization they've added to this game has been perfectly acceptable to me. Some of it was poorly priced, but for those I just didn't buy the stuff because it wasn't something I wanted or needed. Then, same as now, I voted with my wallet and opted out. The difference is that now, I no longer feel compelled to spend ANY money on gems, rather than just not spending gems on this system.
---
If just made getting legendary gear more enticing,  which this version does not.
---
&gt; As people have repeatedly said, this crap does not work well with legendary gear. Legendary gear ought to have UI changes that allow you to mass select stats/runes for it
---
It actually kind of does, there's a tick-box for "apply to all".
---
This doesn't solve most cases though, not all gear sets are the same. Support chrono has a very weird gear set, as does power chrono and any class that doesn't have spotter.
---
Don't worry, they'll bring even more Charr Metal concerts to the game soon"
---
Yeah free stuff pays the bills.
---
Can admit they did go a little overboard
---
is still more than fast enough for anything.  
---
you have almost 0.5seconds to mount up before lightning strikes you again.
---
You see as a rewaed for active players, and I see like a paywall to New players (like me). I bought both expasions, why I have to pay for the episodes too? That makes no sense at all. Just sell me the Dlcs with everything included, even if it's more expensive.
---
Oh this release was big, it fucked up my whole game flow big time.
---
&gt; accountwide unlock
---
Oh then its fine if you can unlock a **WHOLE** key, people really need to stop constantly whining, anet give us so many updates for free!!!
---
They gonna have to pay for their food over all, they cant work for free all the time, damm freeloaders.
---
Pretty much the same, 17k hours played and I logged in yesterday to see this disaster, I can’t play my 10-15 min maxed builds for every game mode on each class (I got legendary armor on all 9 professions). I already miss my arcdps templates, so I logged off just 2minutes later to play other games while watching the world burn, there is no way I enjoy this game without min maxing the way I play, and this overpriced limited so called « build template » just isn’t doing it.
---
Same  for 28 gold
---
and half of the current users without an proper official announcement
---
Dudes, i agree with the monetization issues and stuff, but let's take care not to relativize the damage on each.
---
A paid lootbox to *hopefully* unlock a character that is the base of the game is not nearly as close as charging for the 3rd and forward template, which didn't existed a week ago.
---
Yeah, it's scummy, and kinda stupid, we have to raise torches, but if we make exaggerated comparisons, should one they they actually do a really fucked up shit such as the EA scandal, we're kinda gonna be the boy who cried wolf.
---
im really not in the mood to intensify my arm problems. the 6 mouse buttons i already have and use were enough to get me into the trouble
---
I totally agree, and I think that it's a great cause.
---
But I can see how Anet's recent actions unfortunately might be overshadowing that right now. I hope that I'm actually wrong about this and that my tinfoil hat is just too tight.
---
Honestly, I just loved the templates in GW1 - yes, and arcdps templates because they were so similar to the ones in GW1. It was a nice system, simple and convenient.
---
In comparison, GW2 system - especially the equipment template - is quite a feat on the tech side, the swapping is very smooth and you get the extra inventory slots. But, the system also is quite inconvenient and the limitations are horrible.
---
Yes, GW2 "templates" have upsides (ranger pets getting stored is a big one for me), but the downsides - no save button, limitations, equipment and build "templates" separated into different submenus - are just too big when comparing to GW1 templates.
---
I also dislike that the templates are stored on anets server. Though this is a minor gripe I have, purely because I think its unnecessary strain.
---
Isn't that what the account bound build templates are for?
---
They might be just casuals with &lt;100 hours gam play, with just one armor set and one build that just do one game type. 
---
They are happy, ignorance is bliss, at least some one is.
---
The point is, keybinds are not significantly less convenient to justify gem cost. It is comparable to the wheel, and the choice comes down to personal preference. I wouldnt call the wheel a convenience tool, rather an interface option like the action camera.
---
I'm just a casual player, I guess I dont understand why the templates are bad? I thought they were a good thing? Can someone explain the negative aspect? Thanks
---
Not really... Just equip another armor form your inventory and the legendary will sit there. So it's 6 double clicks for switching, then a double click to open bank (perma access) and then 6 double clicks to move them from inventory to bank. On the other char it would be similar. Now you have to remove it from every template by hand and if you use the "take off all" option it also removes weapons and trinkets. And with Arc Templats it would be even more easy as you could swap gear with 2 clicks, and then only have to shift it to the bank and vice versa.
---
Wow, thanks. I'll give that a shot.
---
For basic stuff, sure. But some people are interested in being fully min/maxed for whatever situation they are in (e.g. different mix of berserker/assassin for spotter vs no spotter subgroups, different levels of boon duration for support builds, swapping out creature specific sigils, etc.), and the possible permutations you'd have to memorize for that are well beyond what most people can reasonably remember. Arc made this incredibly simple and feasible.
---
And we had ARC templates before that was good, grrr....
---
I know this is going to get flak from people, but I have always appreciated how cinematic and immersive GW2 is. If raids were just a boss on a platform I would be so horribly uninterested in them. And I think that's demonstrative if the larger issue. At least two large communities exist in this game and their interests run against each other. 
---
Hardcore players want mechanical challenge and unique rewards that they can wave around saying "I am the best" dhuum throne for example. To them the story and open world is all an eye-rolling gate they have to go through every now and then for something.
---
Casual players just want to run around and play fashion wars and do stuff cause they feel like it. I know that's how I feel most nights. We like getting new skins and stuff to try out.
---
So really, Anet's best option to appease both groups is to add more unlockable skins to in game rewards (and hopefully not screw up like the visage of the khan-ur), but the gem shop is the more profitable option and always has been. 
---
Otherwise... I dunno, I don't think there are many things that can be done right now that won't make one group unhappy.
---
a decent amount of that work probably was already done in HoT days
---
GW1
---
I get it! I'm with you.... I was just making a joke. Goodness, the downvotes. I should be less sarcastic online.
---
anet has literally never admitted they were wrong about something even if it was an objective fact. they seem to think feedback is an insult.
---
bye felicia
---
I assume it works similarly to the GW1 templates which looked almost identical when put in text form (Allowing all those wonderful joke builds)  
---
I do know from doing that the chat codes can be added to the clipboard in game via right click on the build's UI slot and pasted in chat or into a notepad file, and can be copy/pasted from presumably any correctly formatted text into the game.
---
Interesting but rather meaningless note, I didn't give them any names in game, and my Rangers appear to use the most of the available space.  
---
[&amp;*A...A=]; where A is a placeholder value and all of them end with '='
---
Thanks! Glad to hear.
---
I hope that sooner or later another add on like ARC Template comes to the game, or Delta just resume development "at my own risk", like they say.
---
Anet, we don't deserve this template system.
---
Sometimes it has been, sometimes it hasn't. If you look back at the rage around, say, ascended armor, I think it was probably way overblown. If exotic was still the max tier reward structures for the game would have been screwed, they were just too easy to get. But you had a lot of the same "terrible ANet" and "after X hours played, I'm quitting the game" threads.
---
If you wanna have a real discussion about rage in this community, I think this community ultimately makes itself hard to respond to by whipping up into a frenzy on the regular. There's no frame of reference for what's a real problem anymore. Look at the "permaban for modified arcdps" threads from a couple of weeks back. 1 rumor circulates and the whole subreddit was up in arms in a second.
---
That said, I'm not trying to give ANet a pass. I was really feeling deflated by the way they hyped the Icebrood announcement, and I think that was justified frustration. I also think these templates are a problem, but honestly will just inconvenience me slightly at worst. I honestly just can't get a feel for how these will actually impact people's gameplay a few weeks in, because everyone is just making rage posts.
---
We don't need more over promising while under delivering ...
---
It's alright now that they opened it up a bit. Before it was a total mess. You couldn't just look at the minimap and figure out the path (which was likely windy) from A to B.
---
I have not played in a while and this popped up on my front page. They finally did templates? It sounds like they screwed it up though? Can anyone link to a post with more info about what happened lol
---
Comparing apples to dirt there mate.
---
Aye, and now I have all that equipment and can't use it!
---
(it's impossible to manage 6 full sets / variations manually)
---
How does it feel to be wrong?
---
Most likely Heal Herald, different than the WvW build for no/less toughness.
---
Please ARC _come back to us_ 
---
 😥 😥 😥
---
Taking away the WvW and PvP automated builds was such a stupid decision..... I was ok about how the templates were presented, since I've never used arcdps for that. I thought I could have one extra build for each character. Nope, even WITHOUT THE ARCDPS, they ALREADY gave us something WORSE than what we had before  
---
That is such an accomplishment, I never thought it would be possible.
---
Not that I know of.
---
so running fractals isnt required at all, thanks for your contribution
---
you're welcome.
---
it's a convenience feature that has made it less convenient for some people :/
---
Well these aren't similar, but great RPGs. May I suggest if you want a new MMO go to either Warframe or dungeons and dragons online. Maybe you would like to take a break from MMO like I have. I suggest going to The outer worlds, or kingdom come.
---
How in the world did this garbage make it into the game lmao
---
A lot of people want this but honestly think about the track record of EAnet lately. It would scare me how much they would monetize that system.
---
Equipment templates should be unlimited like Arc and Guild Wars 1.
---
&gt; But for the monetization part, I am ok with it. It's a company, build templates were developed, developers need to get paid.
---
The problem isn't that it's monetized. It's HOW it's monetized. 
---
If this were just one price for universal account slots with sub-slots, everything would be fixable. Anywhere the feature underperformed could be fixed.
---
But since multiple slots are monetized with most being character bound, they can't make all of the improvements they need to. People have undoubtedly already sunk hundreds of dollars into it. 
---
If they make a change which devalues these slots then they have stepped on the toes of the people who have already paid.
---
If they don't make a change which devalues these slots then they step on the toes of everyone else who you see here on Reddit. People who were hoping for the feature.
---
It's kind of hard to fix things like gear sharing between characters when you have people's wallets between every single connection of these new features. They basically dropped it on us and made it final. Checkmate.
---
Ye, I'm playing Destiny now, free to play and there's actually content that's new for me.
---
They decided to abandon their amazing game and make a terrible sequel, because money. That is what happened.
---
Thanks for the reply, though I'm not interested in taking a break from the MMO genre.
---
that depends on how much you are willing to pay per year for subscription fees and DLC.
---
Final Fantasy XIV
---
It's not related to that. Arcdps was actually working as a pre-recorded macro for changing builds and several other things that would make it a TOS breaking third party program. But Anet made an exception with it and gave it the green light (but of course at your own risc, including posible bans). 
---
But when legendary upgrades were released anet probably told the developer not to include them because the release of anet's own method was "close enough" to release date.
---
So explain to me why people think the new system is useless? (apart from the insane gem cost to unlock all slots)
---
Wild star! Oh wait... but honestly no combat in other games is as good as guild wars. With that being said, I have been having a great time playing the new archeage unchained. It’s tab targeting but the skills feel good; a lot of class options. A bit grindy but not overly grindy. I enjoy the grind tbh
---
So you are saying that they removed the ability to manualy change equipment? o.O
---
If the game is good enough, I wouldn't mind subscriptions. Though I'm usually against subscription.
---
I am comparing sub fees and not what the game itself provides. The problem is with the game and how terrible it is and not with the sub fee is my point. People acting like 100 dollars is outrageous for a years sub fee is misplaced.
---
&gt; I've seen a lot of complaints about Guild Wars 2 over the last 24 hours, saying things like quit the game etc etc. Vote with your wallet and many many more.
---
That always happen here on reddit when an update/descision isn't 100% pefect, somebody finds a point to stir up drama and/or people don't understand something. One or more of this points and this reddit goes in ragemode. Sadly real and justified criticism is kinda hard to find between all the pointless complaints at this times. 
---
However, give it a week or two and it's over, like always. The thing with the "leaving" guys is, that they mystically come back the next time some drama is stired up.
---
9 classes * 3 elites * different runes?
---
No I don't remember how I made my built for Winterspring farming for each alt, I just clicked and run. And I was happy. 
---
No more now.
---
Hold up... Daredevils are great for burst? Holy crap, I've been dissuaded to try that class so many times!
---
Hmm... I might invest more time into learning weaver. (Hearing how fluid it is after you get it down sounds really rewarding!)
---
Can I trouble you for some tips on making the weaver learning process more efficient? I'm currently reading and watching snowcrows rotations and trying them out on the golem
---
I can't stop laughing to this lol, so accuarate, the "soon tm" my god lmao
---
Why can't you use it? Did they delete your sets?
---
If that's the infinite height thing that wasn't a glitch. Abuse of given mechanics? Maybe, but not broken code.
---
why does this version not?
---
APES STRONG TOGETHER
---
have you heard of templates and arcdps lmao
---
yeah but how much are you willing to pay at most per year for initial purchase, subscriptions and DLC?
---
 I am not missing it, but it's a good point. It's important to not put all your eggs into 1 basket. 
---
Anet in the end could not maintain GW2 and it's profits along side whatever other projects were going on in the background.
---
You gained the ability to quickly share builds.
---
They are not serviceable for many players, specially those who were using ARC templates.
---
They are not the worst thing in the world, but they need a lot of improvement before they are worth their cost.
---
I created a google sheets page and made tabs for each profession.
---
Forgetting to swap is awkward. But being able to share builds is great.
---
I don't really see your point.
---
And today its like "the more you exploit human behaviour, the more money you make". For example via lootboxes or similar stuff.
---
go ahead and let us know when you are done please
---
Looks like the skycale is not included.
---
Ben Arnold, the developer of Chaos trilogy fractals, was struggling with them in T2.
---
I'm a PvE only player with only a few builds but yeah...this was not the great update I was expecting.
---
I'm not too impacted, just shelled out 500 gems for another gear slot on my guardian since I had 500 laying about doing nothing so I'm all set now with my dps, support, and hybrid builds on that character.
---
But damn if it's not a well designed system that's kinda frustrating to use. And given that I ONLY PvE (open world/fractals) and have very few builds in a game that encourages build experimentation, I can only imagine how much worse it is for players who play multiple modes/have more builds and gear.
---
I get it, they need to generate revenue, but between how stingy the free slots are/the price of individual character unlocks and the not that great functionality/design (seriously, we couldn't just combo build/gearsets together?), *especially* compared to the ease of creating/swapping sets via ARC, this is a poor replacement.
---
Anet needed a win and could have had a solid one with this. But they're blowing it : (
---
How dare he use a better free template than this garbage anet just released!
---
How dare he play more than 1 build on his revenant! 
---
How dare he enjoy playing both high-end content PvE and WvW!
---
No No that is not possible. PAY PAY PAY! Does he want to play 10 builds on 1 character? NO FUCKING WAY PAY THE FUCK UP AND IF U NEED MORE BUY MORE CHARACTER SLOTS AS WELL.
---
Funnily enough, hardcores are the ones that are getting fucked. The vast majority just GAINED a ton of functionality.
---
Saying 300 gems to "save" a line of code on one character is not justified criticism. Yep...
---
Welcome to capitalism enjoy your stay.
---
Btw, if you're trying to mention MMO games, Star Wars KOTOR is not one of them. KOTOR (Knights Of The Old Republic) was the original (and awesome) Star Wars RPG from Bioware for X-Box and PC. The MMO is called Star Wars TOR (The Old Republic) or SWTOR.
---
I also havent figuered out the problem people are having with the system, i choose another template, put my equip in there and did another build, it worked.
---
I assume most problems are runes or legendary gear related. I dont know.
---
People waved their money to anet to do it. They literally cried rivers to let them pay anet to get it. So they got it.
---
It is not that bad. You have export for builds, so all that is needed is inventory templates, and one template literally costs just under 200 gold.  But people rather spend their gold on being supernova cancer with infusions...
---
For most alts, since gearing a second slot would be too much cost, I'm just using them for different weapon sets. Like to switch to ranged weapons faster when I'm going to deal with enemies that are nasty in melee range. .
---
You know, like the 4 F1 to F4 weapon presets we had for free in GW1, but just 2.
---
So you can.  Thanks.  I guess there's just a different way to do stuff now!
---
I can cope with all of this.  Just not the stupid pricing.  I've lost all hope of this ever being free but for the love of god ANet, this shit needs to be a tenth of the price you're charging.
---
Indeed, its just a shortterm drama that wont really end up in anything. As a new player I wouldnt worry about it at all, and just enjoy the game.
---
I'm sorry but comparing build templates to Fallout 76 anything is idiotic if you don't mind me saying. Yes Build templates (which lots of people said they would buy anyway) has had a problem with the cost but to compare it to what was it a $120 subscription in a fucking horrible, broken game thats nothing more that cash grab on a beloved franchise (I don't like it but still) is disingenuous. Build Templates may have annoyed some people but Anet aren't asking people to pay $120 to even use the main feature.
---
Same here.  We knew there would be a charge for this, but the cost is absolutely 100% taking the piss.
---
Make this a tenth of the price and i'd consider spending it.
---
I am going to be brutally honest with you in hopes that it might shake you and others who read it free from some destructive patterns. I don't spend a lot of time on these forums and I have still noticed your name popping up a lot, so you might need to hear this more than most. The truth is that you, and many others, come to these forums and play amateur game devs with broad proclamations about how things should be done, not because you have some expertise, but as a form of therapy. You have confused relationships with both the games you play, and the developers behind those games. Companies often actively try to cultivate these confused relationships so don't feel too badly. Yet, despite what they would like you to believe, GW2 is a product and Anet is company, not your friend. Once you actually internalize those facts, you won't be drawn to these forums as a means of seeking support in processing their actions. If McDonald's starts selling a new Big Mac at a price I don't like, I don't hop on reddit to find people who agree that it is a bad deal and tell anyone who will listen how I think a good hamburger should be made. I simply don't go to McDonalds. If Anet is offering a product that you don't find appealing, it is time to find one that does appeal to you instead.
---
&gt; Give it a week or two
---
It's been going on for almost a year lol. Every 2 weeks new reason for certain people.
---
Anet is as much responsible as anyone else.
---
People try to blame NCsoft for everything. NCsoft tells them what the submission is, but how they reach it its all up to ANet.
---
This is the last 2 years of ANet in a nutshell though.  Literally every announcement has been 1 step forward and multiple steps back.
---
The difference is that betheseda promised a cosmetic only shop, delivered a shitty game that was not worth the 60$, then puts in overpriced cosmetics like a blue color that cost 20$, then ads qol features in she shop and now wants you do pay another 100$
---
People wanted templates and were crying rivers that they will pay Anet to finally do it. Anet did it. It costs few hundreds of gold, it is even cheaper than most of outfits and actually gives you new functionality.
---
There are issues how those work, as system possibly needs some tinkering (similarly as they added search to new stat selections). Big issue for many people is that they had autoclicker for changing stats and it does not work anymore.
---
All i remember is a presentation for all the non-game related retail tie ins we could now spend our money on
---
Funko pops?  Fuck off.
---
How. Half an expansion, like $20, plus twelve months of subs for $15 = $200.
---
If you say that "I buy WoW tokens", I'm going to say that time is money.
---
Nah, that's not enough feedback on the printout. Should be more like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXwb_7DdZeQ).
---
But is that really a problem though, as long as you know how it works ? I don't see much point in crafting legendary runes if you're not going for a full set. On the other hand, this could be used to customize the bonus you gain in certain cases.
---
everything disappears if i leave any tab and come back to it?
---
Just wait until people are using multiple templates and /gg to massively cheese certain encounters etc on fractals/raids
---
Wait until ANet are forced to put out a patch that disables changing gear templates after the first 2 minutes of being zoned into any fractal or raid.
---
after a while,i just deleted build templates and left only skill templates. GREAT ADDITION TO THE GAME. swap weapon? instantly overwriten template? wtf.
---
It also allows to hire more part time developers and artists for some needed projects to complement the team.
---
&gt;  It's just common and good practice here.
---
For sure, but absolutely not in gaming. Also definitely not in legacy and enterprise, good fucking luck convincing any manager to dedicate time away from pumping in new features that some client is demanding instead of actually making everyone's lives easier down the line.
---
i just had the same problem with a new thread but i think that thread got some reports and since then got removed. The reports may have triggered a safeguard that comments need to be approved manually by a mod until the whole thread is reviewed and they either approve it or lock/delete it.
---
Speculating: I'm guessing it's simply Heal Herald that'll never die itself. 
---
If you're playing with complete idiots, despite Heal Renegade having absolutely incredibly healing output, you will quickly run out of energy if you have to constantly spam healing skills. And forget about your special stuff like Orders from Above. 
---
So if your teammates really suck, you could just run Herald instead, maybe even with Dwayna runes. Your regen will tick at around 800hp/s, on all 10 people. You won't need very much concentration at all due to gear and traits, and, and you'll keep up Regen, Protection, Fury, Swiftness, about 15 stacks of Might on all 10 people, and you can choose to drop one of those to keep up that unique concentration buff so your chronos do less of a shitty job. And with mostly full Nomad's you'll be able to take over tanking from even a pug Minstrel Chrono - you'll have 2381 Toughness, and 30.6k health (with the Dwayna runes).
---
Herald has access to good blocks on X/Shield and Staff so they can do a good job on a bunch of encounters where you need to avoid mechanics but also stand still to stop the boss from moving (e.g. VG's blues, Xera's blurred frenzy, etc).
---
So it really would be a build for mega-carrying.
---
&gt;Guildwars 2 is officially the only MMO in the world which actively punishes you for investing more time into it, and punishes you for being invested in all of its game modes... Instead of, y'know, rewarding you, like every other game ever made.
---
There is nothing wrong in stopping playing gw2 if the game is so disappointing. If people complain but keep playing and spending money on it, well, they'll keep doing it.
---
Actions speak louder than words do.
---
I can "afford" to spend literally thousands of pounds on gems right now.  I choose not to because I'd rather have a nice holiday instead.
---
At this point, it's par for the course.
---
If only they spent money to build controller support in...
---
oh lord that is so funny
---
Wait... Did you really buy ALL of the build template expansions ? Did i read that right ?
---
After this we will be getting official DPS Meter right?
---
and ofc we haven't forgotten TacO have we, unlocked per map!
---
They used to be a player-friendly studio with a fair monetarization policy.
---
Now they are as horrible as any mobile gaming scam studio.
---
Threats getting removed because they asked too many similar questions. Probably moderator got online, possibly some megathreat can go up later...? 
---
Mainly it was people asking what is so wrong that reddit community is in full brigade mode...
---
This happened on reddit either yesterday or a couple of days ago. There was just a backlog in the reddit servers and we had to wait for comments to appear. [It looks like it's happened again](https://twitter.com/redditstatus/status/1189586505284538369), but they've made another tweet saying they've implemented the fix and are just waiting to see what happens now.
---
My point is with their current business model, most of the people who will get the LS episodes will get them for free. There will be people who will pay for them in time, but not as many. And they need to make money somehow and I assume that's why the templates are not entirely free as many complain about. 
---
I agree that their business model is stupid. Newcomers will have to pay a lot more for the content than I did. I paid for the expansion, and now I get 5 expansion maps + other features, LS4(6 maps) and LS5/Saga(as many maps as this will be)  because I logged in every 3 months. I think if they charged for the LS maps regardless if you are currently playing or not, we would see less gem store items, and more stuff like templates for free. I feel like with their current model it would be obvious that things like templates are not entirely free.
---
Why is 100 dollars for a year worth of sub retarded? (poor word there) ie: stupid.
---
I did, I'm always hurting for karma because I buy stuff like pact supply materials daily and obsidian shards when making legendaries.
---
Oh trust me, I'm well into the acceptance phase. I only play GW2 for a couple hours every release now. The reason why I seem so upset is precisely because I loved GW1, and I really *want* to like GW2, but it just consistently falls short.
---
The overwhelming majority of my gaming time is devoted to playing League with IRL friends, and whatever fun new release they want to pick up.
---
The difference is that the people in control loved playing and making games. The people in control these days could barely tell you the name of their favourite game. They are not developers, but investors.
---
I've been around, don't tell me that my industry didn't previously have a whole lot more love in it across the board than it does today.
---
It's kind of just reminding us all of anet's incompetency as developers.
---
Delta is out here with a functionally perfect third party tool. 1st party devs can't even wrap it in a gui. (no paid version gets on delta's level)
---
Too much tech debt eh anet?
---
Sending unequipped gear back to your inventory shouldnt be "..all sorts of confusion regarding your inventory that their system isn't designed to deal with." If a third party addon could handle that, it should be in reach of a multi million dollar company. 
---
But maybe im just salty that build templates dont function much like templates at all. For the record (I was curious) in the announcement blog post they used the word "template" 57 times.
---
Yup. You are right. Thanks for clarifying
---
If we could still use ARC templates we would not be complaining
---
Imagine a company let consumers use a feature for free, for a long time.
---
Years later, not only they charge you for using the feature that used to be free, but it's an inferior version of what you used to have.
---
" I'll solve your problem. Buy another character slot and split the builds between them. wvw / pve. "
---
And this is why companies can get away with anything nowadays...
---
Sure. So what?
---
Oh Aesma sweety, it'll be ok. Shhhhh Daddy Inks will take care of everything.
---
Yeah those are pretty big generalisations. Anet have their problems but many of the points you are making are incorrect or spun with a particular motive.
---
For example, the human female stretching animation wasn't removed for the reasons you gave and has been discussed, including by the person that raised them as an issue to Anet, on reddit quite a bit.
---
Bye
---
You just answered your own question. I pay blizzard more than 100 dollars a year for a sub.
---
&gt;"you can easily afford it if you have a job"
---
Implying everyone's American too.
---
This game also has a considerable European and Latin American user base. Salaries in some of those countries are inferior to American ones.
---
&gt; You never trust players. You trust data.
---
I disagree somewhat. I'd say "always trust data, only trust players sometimes". Players are *really good* at telling you that a problem exists in a game. They're the ones most closely invested into it and with the best real-world knowledge of how things get implemented. But they're also *really bad* at telling you how to fix those problems. 
---
Player feedback is important to get a sense of what exact problems exist. You just have to ignore pretty much all suggestions for fixes from them.
---
You are missing the point, where I just don't play the game without templates.. BAN means nothing to me.
---
Weren't they? I am sure somewhere out there someone was. It's just a fair point to be made that the new system opens up storage space, which also costs gems in this game.
---
Sure, why not. 600 gems to unlock this options. Per character.
---
Uhh...is this an actual 3rd party add on? Where to get?
---
Stuff pls thx
---
It is consistent in the way that they "gave" us a PvE, a WvW and a PvP build. PvP has it's own gear system so we don't "need" the 3rd equipment template.
---
And yes, that's a shit thing to do, just like the whole templates are in general.
---
Wow, Soo don't buy it lel, what's your fckin problem they worked so hard for doing this new mount wheel. So why should we get everything for free, lol. Get a job and support them more for their work!
---
Praise The Devs!!!!11!!1
---
Can I have your build templates?
---
Don't give them any ideas.
---
They were advertised and promoted as a reason to buy HoT.  They were delayed (Month+ after HoT release), one was released (Shortbow), then cancelled, then came out much much later.  People were buying HoT for those legendaries, what they did is inexcusable.
---
Can I have your stuff ?
---
&gt;  It's important to not put all your eggs into 1 basket.
---
Completely agree with that. I would've been very interested in seeing what Anet could conjure up that's not a sequel, something fresh would've been nice. But as always they overextended by taking on more projects they could handle and got punsihed for it.
---
I guess that he can easily afford to send me a check for 50$ then, since he has a job. No problems there, right?
---
Take care.
---
Yes they LET you have a 3rd party feature for free. It's now in the game and it isn't free. cry me a river. 
---
And you are right, it's all my fault. I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY. (not really sorry LUL )
---
Also did I solve their problem or not?
---
You can, you just need to make sure you don't violate the ToS while using any third party.
---
Do I NEED any of this? 
---
I don’t swap anything unless my spec gets nerfed or another gets buffed.
---
And if I were to get any of this, I’d just grind gold and try get it that way.
---
I'm new and leveling my first toon..can I have your stuff?
---
Well, if you knew anything about Fallout 76 and how "great" its optional subscription is you wouldn't ask that question, but that's beside the point. The point wasn't about the price specifically; the point was that "being able to afford something" is a piss-poor metric for judging if something is worthwhile or fair to the consumer.
---
WvW players are poor lmao
---
Dude we can't use ARC template since a couple of weeks: do you know what you are tolking about?
---
nobody cares
---
That's because it was disabled by the man responsible by arcdps templates himself way prior to the update. Get your **** together.
---
per map? you're being generous, i figured per area.
---
We already reached a point where I would not even buy an expansion any more. I don't want to support such unfair business practices.
---
&gt;Even if I somehow broke down and bought all of the predatorily-monetized max number of templates
---
Evidently you didn't...  "Even if I somehow broke down and bought all of the predatorily-monetized max number of templates "
---
The problem for me is the frequency. 
---
I returned for the living world episodes, but after finishing the stories, the maps became rather useless to me. I never returned to them.
---
For me it's just poor time investment, since it's not something that brings a lot of players back into the game. 
---
They have good story writers and map designers, but POF wasn't what I expected. I expected something more HOT-like, with big map bosses.
---
The presentation was a disappointment to me, I had some hopes, but as a WvW player it was another kick in the guts. It's just what I think though 
---
Take care :p
---
I have like 5-6k obsidian shards.
---
If i had a gun that shoots them, i would use you as target practice. &lt;3
---
This is funny.
---
Also sad because I wouldn't be surprised.
---
Same.  For 28g.
---
Gw2 builds are saved on the server, unlike GW builds
---
GW2's woes are one hundred percent ANet's fault. NCSoft aren't the ones writing clunky code, designing clunky systems and interfaces, writing incredibad story and dialogue, failing to communicate with their customers in an effective manner, and failing to meet any sorts of expectations including ones they publicly set. This is all ANet being a horribly managed and horribly staffed dev shop that has lost anyone who had enough talent to actually make a move on their own terms.
---
No, but your use of it was, as previously said, reductive and dismissive.  These thing are likely to encourage an aggressive response far more than simply disagreement would.
---
Lol, you have such a ridiculous wealth of content in front of you as a new player. Why would you value the statement of someone who clearly has no life and burnt himself out?
---
Just out of pure curiosity, can you give a hypothetical example of such a thing? I'm reasonably familiar with fractals but I cannot think of a way to execute such an exploit.
---
Thats a crazy stretch if I ever read one. They're probably one of the fairest in what they monetize. With the exception of build templates of course.
---
Attention
---
spend the time if you find a nice community, it's worth it. I've played for almost 3k hours and I loved every minute of it.
---
cool
---
I guess it's semi unrelated but I think it's important to know that the price point itself isn't the problem in your argument or the argument that you disagree with. It's not that it's 100 dollars, it's that it's not worth 100 dollars in your opinion.
---
All I remember is the "nobody cares about pvp" joke from the presenter.
---
Yea. I think what I'll do is keep my 3 free build slots for whatever I'm actively doing for quick swapping. Like if I'm doing Silverwastes (loljk who does that anymore), I'll have my 3 active builds set to staff-event-tagging, breach bosses, and middle lane reflects.
---
You should do it, that'll show'em!
---
Per trail
---
Per achievement
---
Once upon a time, Anet had lots of talent. Now there are definitely a few great devs...
---
actually he pointed out the fact that acc build slots come in packages of 3 and not buy 1 by 1 so you only have to buy 7 or 6 if you "buy" the free one instead of 21 maybe read properly
---
Dibs on the equipment templates
---
It's frustrating to put so much time into a game, only to feel like a developer is not only neglecting your experience, but making it worse. Have fun with whatever you move onto next.
---
You aren't the most dedicated player, sorry.
---
I'm also at 35k AP and played since launch. This game was rainbows and sunshine for me until they released their first RNG gem store dye pack. Paid $10 for 30 silver worth of dyes. Ever since then, their monetization has dimmed my passion for this game more and more.
---
You're such a child haha
---
Suddenly I don't want an official radial menu. Please Arenanet, we are fine. I repeat. *We don't want an official radial mount menu!!!!*
---
Always sad to see someone leave. Hopefully ANet manages to turn the ship around in the future. Hope you find another game to occupy your time, or even another hobby. Good luck.
---
thanks for giving it to me then, you're really active in this comment section :D
---
Well of course, everyone prefers the free unlimited version of something.
---
Welcome to the real world, where providing substandard quality for high prices isnt competitive and loses you money to the competition.
---
Playing the game once a week to look at preeettyyy skins is now considered creation of content?
---
Or...
---
Wait for it...
---
You could copy/paste from (txt file, snowcrows site, click in guild message) and you have the exact same build funcionality as arc, only faster.
---
Then all you need is gear tabs.
---
Well, you do need it if you don't wanna suck when doing different content.
---
But it's obvious that that's too much for you to understand.
---
i'm guessing you work for anet don't you?
---
Things have gone downhill but lets not exaggerate. We are still getting content releases (LW episodes) for free and HoT has gone free too.
---
The way that templates have been handled is complete shit but overall Anet does not even begin to compare to a mobile scam studio.
---
np I've got nothing better to do hans
---
thank you, that's very sweet.
---
christ that outfit is hideous
---
Well atleast I hope they know they delivered a pile of cold shit, not even steaming.
---
thank you very much, and have fun in the game! :D
---
Because that can be me in x years. I came to GW2 after 8 years of Wow which is now a constant grindfest. And a game company losing dedicated players and not reflecting on this does not bode well for the future. And I hope GW2 has a future.
---
Yeah I'm super on the fence about it. I don't think it's worth the gems at all, but some people (like me) have plenty of gold to spare from accumulating it for many years...
---
As it is tradition for any game that let's you modify the experience in any way. Ever tried playing WoW, ESO, literally any MMOs without addons? Ever tried playing TES games without mods fixing base game mechanics? Oxygen Not Included without mod increasing range of duplicant interaction by 1 tile to the top, forcing you to make a temporary scaffolding for any room you make?
---
Players will always find to "fix" game mechanics if given tools. And no, it's not "bad game design", that's just business practice unfortunately. Why make something, if you can make bare bones good and then community will work out the rest?
---
There are new players asking questions every day. And people like this claiming that they're "quitting" are usually back for the next content drop every time.
---
How about gem store RNG dye packs? Pay $10 and get 30 silver worth of dyes. At least mount packs guarantee you an unlock.
---
I am a software engineer in the games industry with multiple shipped titles, some of which I did provide post launch content support. I have a decades worth experience across AAA, Indie and simulation development.
---
But that would be a full build template anymore if you have to manually change stuff...
---
&gt; You are just normal person with 28 + characters
---
You lost me here.
---
but for what do u need storage space anymore tho
---
Yeah you don't really need to play the game either, how's that for an argument?
---
There are still WvW Alliances, there is still hope LUL(TM)
---
I'm personally content with the build templates. They delivered on the general request of the community. Of course it won't fit every single person's idea of what it should have been, but it can always be improved.
---
I'm loving it so far. I think this game isn't getting the attention it deserves! It's perfect for me and I adore the graphics and the game play. I've found a lovely guild, too! 
---
It's just every few months a new jolly announcement backfires and this reddit implodes.
---
EA says hello.
---
most people who have had mutable builds doesn't have a fully new set for every single build, infact most builds only swapped out 1-3 pieces
---
Whats sad is the "vocal minority" to them are the launch players who signed up for gw2 brand of mmo. The people who the design documents for the game actually targeted.
---
you made me lol, enjoy your upvote
---
To be fair, 54 eq slot's isn't really "extreme"... I feel like the only reason it's limited to 6 slots for now is so they can later expand it to 9. We've seen it with shared inventory slots.
---
I think the type of people who would have done this, had arc's templates for years.  Admittedly, arc was slower.  But its hard for me to imagine those 10 seconds or so will be game breaking.
---
lmao
---
At this point it should be obvious that the "vocal minority" is the original target audience for the game. Wvwvw players, spvp esport style players, people who want hard pve. People who read the design docs on the release of the game.
---
I read a comment that the game is a furry simulator now. I really agree with that. This is the target audience and they don't get that were mad because anet is neglecting the original audience of the game.
---
I had quit due to no new content at the latest announcement but still popped in for a raid once or twice. This is a real shame because I think the game is done for me.
---
Bye, Felicia
---
I stopped playing after PoF. I still browsed the reddit but I didn't feel the need to make a grand exit.
---
There is an option to turn off commander tags if you are already in a squad.  Wouldn't that work?
---
&gt; You can easily just ignore or not click on these posts if you don't like them so much. 
---
I would, but OP clearly wanted attention so I humored them and gave it.
---
&gt; you can't expect everyone to read through every post 
---
Except oh, I don't know, the posts that literally said what OP was trying to say *are on the front page.* I never implied that people should read every single post. But if you missed something as obvious as the *front* page, then I don't know anymore.
---
But then templates wouldn’t count for anything and we would be back at square 1
---
Most of my stuff is account bound anyways ;D 
---
Take care!
---
lootboxes, ridiculous drop rates, minimal content drops disguised with ambiance, ignoring feedback, scandal after scandal, RNG monetization, sounds like a mobile scam studio to me.
---
Communication was one sided.
---
This is at least 2nd or 3rd time we hear those things about new balance teams, new members, blah blah.
---
As a WvW player last time I was satisfied with an update was when they introduced desert borderlands, so still have it better than ppl who don't like them.
---
I'm in the same boat as OP.
---
You know, since there is no gear treadmil and new raid content only coming rarely in time, minmaxing in raids and optimizing every tiny bit is an essential thing for hardcore players.
---
We had the option to save an unlimited amount of builds for different encounters and teamcomps with arcdps buildtemplates. Now we don‘t have this option any longer.
---
So yeah, it kinda ruined my gameplay experience. Ans many other‘s as well.
---
Yes, using legendary gear to support several builds is a fringe case we invented. It has nothing to do with legendary gear having stat swap. Just an elitist thing. 
---
These filthy elitists and their builds. How dare they have an opinion, they shouldn't even play this game.
---
Guild Wars 1 build templates would like a word.
---
All we ever wanted was GW1 build templates.
---
Well, he already gave his money to Anet, they've won again...
---
With how you've set out your builds, it seems like the real answer is to buy a second character slot to load your WvW builds and gears onto.
---
The patch is rather disappointing. I don't understand why it's so *cheap* of anet, why not 10 build slots per expansion? I can understand minimizing the gear setups because they're effectively extra bagspace but when you're neutering the ability to have builds based on the amount of gear slots you have, it doesn't pan out. Why can't build templates interact with the *specialized gearbags* that we've already bought/made? Maybe it's just me, but being able to tell the game "get my concentration/expertise to XYZ, load the rest up with Power gear" would fix 99% of the issues that heavy users would have with the system.
---
And they haven't fully implemented PvP build templates, and you don't automatically change builds when moving between PvE and WvW anymore!
---
This comment physically hurts.
---
You litteraly said to buy build templates... lmao ! 10/10
---
Give your money to Anet, nothing is wrong, they totally deserve it.
---
And Cupcakes! They deserve cupcakes too. :)
---
Public test servers........?
---
You're such a beta haha
---
EANet needs to get enough money from Build Templates, to have the resources to fund the bug fix. You know how small Indie companies are.
---
&gt;  going silently 
---
*Looks at the front page.*
---
*Sees at all the most upvoted posts of the past* ***day****.*
---
*Looks at your words.*
---
&gt;silently
---
[Me.](https://tenor.com/wk56.gif)
---
Again, I'm not defending Anet *at all.* But don't you think it's a stretch to say that people are being silent about it in the first place?
---
Actually, it sounds like they've become NCSoft... Because NCSoft already does all of that crap in their own MMORPGs.
---
Sure. But for 9 characters you likely had 9 sets, or did you swap between characters?
---
...based on the agreement he had with anet.
---
Shut the fuck up and spoonfeed me.
---
You sometimes want to see ranged squad etc.
---
I’m sorry for your loss.  Can I have your stuff?
---
Just tried to do Mad King Says, got DC'd twice while another guy was complaining in map chat about being unable to finish it due to DCs he had been experiencing all day. That's something Anet really needs to fix immediately.
---
What's your favorite game?
---
You put more effort in writing this, that the effort anet is putting in anything they are doing with the game right now
---
Don't forget it's a free, unlimited version _with more features_ too
---
I kept them separate for now because the wardrobe tab is pretty full, but the space for a mount toggle is definately there. It could even be some sub-tabs at the bottom or a toggle like aquatic / terrestial skills.
---
i only raid wings 1-4 :-)
---
Lol they were worthless before.
---
I mean I also understand that it's also for the sake of personal hygiene which is pretty important in GW2..
---
But then your pve template will be gone and you will have to manually change it back, which is what we were doing already without templates. Templates are useless in this case.
---
Shift or CTRL click a BUILD to link it in chat. If you simply want to copy it outside of the game or in Guild MOTD, just right click a BUILD and press 'Copy'. You can paste it anywhere.
---
Too many players violated NDA’s
---
Their cash shop policy is the same as always - selling skins and minor convenience. We still get a decent amount of stuff to unlock through gameplay (as much as this sub likes to pretend otherwise) and we get major content releases for free. That is not at all like a mobile scam game. Scam games are low quality ripoffs that make you pay for everything. GW2 is not that.
---
They're not the same company they were even a year ago.  Lack of direction or what/where they want this game to be, ignoring feedback, censoring the forums, abandoning entire game modes, losing 140ish employees including a founder, and so on.
---
I honestly have no idea where Anet is going anymore or how they plan to even get out of this hole.  Furthermore, anytime they do actually talk, they make it sound like things are just peachy which is mind-boggling to me.
---
This is just going to make them add a “cool down” mechanic to switching builds in WVW and pvp.   Just like they did with mounting too quickly.
---
&gt; They literally announced that they're leaving balance to devs with experience in the competitive aspects of GW2, and will do separate balancing.
---
just for lulz: about a year ago they merged the balance teams "to imrpove communication within the team" and now we're here. what they are promising now sounds amazing, however until we see actual results it's only empty marketing talk.
---
It's a good read but god damn the timing and that title... hahaha! Is it tongue in cheek? Is it dissonance? It's clever at least.
---
A lot of what he wrote may come off as common sense but it's well articulated. I think what he said about the "inflated score essentially being good for company morale is interesting. He does acknowledge that there is still bad to take with the good, but it's presented as a passing thought. 
---
I think it's important to make sure that development teams have a reliable way to ground themselves and avoid echo chambers. A way to avoid sinking into the pit of believing everything being awful and a way to avoid floating off with false praise.
---
Maybe that's part of learning to narrow your focus? Being able to identify the core principles of what improves fun or hurts it, being able to find things to learn from or things to correct.
---
His conclusion sounds like a roundabout way of saying it's important to have a vision and then build along it rather than build piecemeal parts of fun and hoping the end result is worth it.
---
YES! except for the storing your gear. BUT YES!
---
Save us DELTA! SAVE US
---
OK, point taken.
---
[This post](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/89344/equipment-templates-offer-less-for-those-that-have-invested-into-the-game-more-legendary-issues) covers it better than I will.
---
Also, there are problems (that are hopefully bugs that will be fixed soon) where quickswapping legendary weapons/armor from your inventory between templates removes all upgrades, including infusions.) If this is a bug, then it is incredible it made it through testing, as it happens fairly consistently.
---
Well, the guys they've put in charge are very active community members and have pretty good credentials. I think it's fair to be hopeful this time.
---
It's when you have squishy backliners who won't survive a push in with the commander, not something you play with pugs but in organised groups, at least on EU.
---
I actually really like the way you set up the equipment slots. Very reminiscent of RPG games.
---
Watch the video. Then you won't be able to unsee it.
---
You referring to the orange "*" (star) that has no message visible?
---
so basically they introduced sth that was in gw1 from the beginning and they want money for it?
---
I have played for over a year and I love the game.  
---
The gameplay feels awesome and there is a ton of content to enjoy. I personally believe the expansions are all worth it but some may argue that shadowkeep (most recent expac should have been more content packed for it's price). Since you can start for free now, there really isn't any risk on trying it out.  
---
If you do give it a shot, check out the reddit for good information on getting started as a new player. The game does not tell you a lot of things that you should know early on and there are some awesome reddit posts that will get you started the right way (totally worth it trust me).  
---
The new shadowkeep expansion just recently came out and the halloween event is currently going on as well. If you like shooters, loot, and fashion (fashion wars ftw), then I think you will love Destiny 2.
---
I think aside from special circumstances like you showed, there aren't enough oppertunities to make it really P2W. 
---
I mean as a thief you were able to do the same thing before templates, not? The changing was slower, but you had enough time thanks to stealth.
---
Other replies have talked about charge usage, but I thought I would mention acquisition...
---
As I levelled and for a time after hitting level 80, Transmutation Charges were fairly rare, so I was hesitant about using them. 
---
After playing for a few months now at level 80, since they are rewarded frequently by daily log-in chests and for zone completion, I'm absolutely swimming in them. I don't have enough armour to transmute!
---
And which you still do not need to play the game.
---
ffxiv is alright after level 50. the grind to get through the base game's story up to the first expansion is extremely boring and tedious (unless you have irl money), but the story afterwards makes up for it.
---
of course gw2's combat system is much better, but ffxiv's combat in pve is not too bad at end game. hellishly boring before lvl 50 though
---
Ah, the EA method of conducting business.
---
&gt; They just don't want you to gain an advantage with arc over those who don't have a 3rd party tool like that. 
---
But have no problem giving advantage to those who can buy enough slots with real money.
---
I bought the bundle with the cute Aurene mini, but I already have a lot of karma boost items I'm not using.
---
Is the game free to play? Is the first expansion included with the second expansion?
---
Oh my what a pathetic little boy, you. Farewell.
---
Hmm, a good article. Knowing that such a guy works on GW2, especially in this dark time, gives me a tiny sliver of hope. It's the only good news I've heard about Anet in months so I'll somewhat cling to it.
---
I really do start to think this is more NCSoft than ANet, which is why all the "OG Crew" of ANet jumped ship in the layoffs. Got their early out ~~golden~~ err...  ~~silver~~ ehhh... bronze parachutes and left. 
---
NCSoft seems to want to take them into EA / Zynga levels of consumer fuckery. Which is a shame. The game is visually beautiful, and I have enjoyed the setting (if not always the story) for 12 odd years. But it really seems like it could be effectively dead soon.
---
&gt; His conclusion sounds like a roundabout way of saying it's important to have a vision and then build along it rather than build piecemeal parts of fun and hoping the end result is worth it.
---
So basically ANet has been doing the exact opposite ... when did he start working at ANet?
---
Fuck you this meme is retarded. The templates do fucking suck and it's time that the gw2 makes noise about the terrible monetization of the game
---
&gt; its something exclusive to the MMO genre
---
I wouldn't go that far. At the top of my head Diablo 3, The Division, Ghost Recon Breakpoint, and Payday 2 include build templates. I don't remember any ot those having a tutorial about it though.
---
Yeah, they want you to spend money. Imagine that *big brain*
---
Well, just pretend build templates never existed.
---
Game is free to play. Name another MMO without a subscription fee that's added more free content than GW2. You would be hard pressed to find one. Downvote me.
---
Don't sell yourself short. Honestly, as a software dev, what you have done here*is* the hard part. For real. Yes, development takes time and skill and thoughtfulness. But it's only *a pain in the ass* if you don't do this ^ first. 
---
Honestly, I don't think they did this^ first.. and if they did, it really clearly wasn't as well thought out as your post.
---
I've looked at the pictures for some time and I while I like it on surface level, I'm not sure that this solution won't result in some other inconvenient edgecases. Moreover, I don't see how it would even be possible to code equipment into this system without dumping *everything* back into player's inventory.
---
But I do like the wardrobe template part, definitely needed for differentiating builds using legendary gear.
---
Just to point out that the game is in a bad place and people who quit the game are more than just a number in the statistics. Also, Reddit is the only place where you can put some criticism, hoping some dev will have enough will to read it, since everything that is not rainbows and sunshine is removed from the official forum as fast as possible.
---
with the gear drop being unidentified gear mostly , nah inventory management is no big ordeal.
---
Account build slots are sold in packs of 3. So it's 3k gems to max out on them.
---
Still an obnoxious sum, though.
---
You think the game is a furry simulator. Your point is invalid.
---
I have a condi, power, and heal or support for the majority of my characters. 
---
If I want to be able to set up each gear set I essentially need to pay £5 per character just for the pleasure of what arc did for free
---
I don't need templates, I didnt mind changing my equipment every time.  Fortunately I mostly play two characters, so what was given is enough for me, but I do understand others like to play with more variety.
---
Honestly, while it's not build templates, as someone else said, it's SLOTS, it's not terrible, it's just that it is so limited and we lost the ability to set a slot as 'default for _____'
---
You know you can all use 3rd party programs still
---
Yeah but now it's different: we had 2 years of arc template before ANET loadouts engine. And it's flawed: look at legendary, swapping betweens games mode. Outrageously monetized.
---
The chat codes for builds have already sparkled interest for add-ons, how long before a full template add-on comes back? 
---
If the backslash keep up ANET won't be able to defend the exclusivity of a BAD system, it would be BAD PR after a BAD release.
---
I know quite a few casual players that do wvw dailies when they get inconvenient pve dailies. Those are the players that rarely open the hero panel at all and usually I have to meet with them one day to set builds every year or so when stuff changes.
---
To those players, it's actually a bad thing that they would have to swap back and forth.
---
A cool concept art picture vs programming a game that looks, feels and works like said picture.

Honestly, there have been major red flags from the start that stopped the game from really improving. It started going downhill around HoT because they spread themselves too thin creating different kinds of content *and then not reusing assets.* You can only sustainably satisfy that many players by reusing assets (such as multiple difficulty levels on the same fight). They did seem to monetize much more aggressively following the launch of PoF, though. Combining the relatively slow release pace for most content with the more aggressive monetization just made it not seem worth it for a lot of people. I do think ArenaNet actually listened to player feedback for once, though, and started implementing more in-game cosmetic rewards (rather than just through the gemstore), but that is probably part of what lead to them monetizing build templates like this.
---
&gt;The people in control these days could barely tell you the name of their favourite game
---
Wow your opinion must really be shit since you can't even tell me the name of your favorite game
---
For casuals like you and me, they are not bad.
---
For the dedicated veterans who used to use Arc templates and/or have lots of legendary items, it is unbelievably broken. It only covers a fraction of builds that those people like having access to (even if they were to fully invest money into maxing the limits it would not cover all the builds they maintained). Legendaries have had reported issues spitting out their sigils/runes - even legendary versions of them! - and infusions if you put them in multiple tabs. Some posts report players crashing whole instances after swapping. Revenants have reported their skill order on the inactive legend is being dropped. PvP and WvW lost their dedicated build configurations (which would switch you to it automatically when you entered that mode), which I think Anet said pvp's is a known issue that they plan to address since it has its own amulet gear system.
---
I have hope that these will be addressed (every launch has launch day woes), but it has benched any desire to make more legendaries for my main, since I may as well just keep using my Bifrost as a rainbow dripping ascended staff and just swap between that on my healing set and my separate ascended staff dedicated to my damage set. Legendaries are supposed to reward perseverance with easy to swap build making, but this system is not allowing the variety that legendaries can make to be saved for easy retrieval (since they restricted the load out tab count, not the raw item storage). For those vets, it is as a straitjacket.
---
If this is your deciding factor in quitting the game it sounds like you could use a well deserved break.
---
Sorry to say, but if he's playing a Rev, the game was \*not\* free to play for him. 
---
He had to have purchased at least one of the expansions, and you're completely ignoring the fact that this game was \*not\* always free to play. 
---
Who are you to say he hasn't been playing since head start and purchased all the expansions before the game went f2p. 
---
He's allowed to vent.
---
With only ascended gear per character and not more than 2-3 builds the official one is gonna do it for me.   
---
Altough I think arcdps does a better job. I just hope now they're not gonna ban it since they have a similar paid feature.
---
&gt;Gear templates are such a fucking mess that we have to wonder if the devs even play the game. And all this could have been avoided if they communicated even a bit during the dev process.
---
I quite frankly think they don't, and haven't since a long time ago.
---
However, I'll also say they don't have to. That's the job of the QA and CM teams (if they even exist to begin with). You can't blame developers for not playing their game, blame direction and management instead, those are the ones who should know, and they obviously don't. Haven't since pretty much release.
---
Pretty much all the game design controversies we've had come down to not knowing their own game. I mean, remember when they tried to sell commander badge colors separately? When the reason why people wanted colors in the first place was to distinguish commanders? Yet for some obscure reason ArenaNet went the "prestige" angle instead?
---
It's been like this since the very beginning. We were just blind to it, and the fanboys didn't help either.
---
Should we tell him? PepeLaugh
---
Per minute charging to avoid Chapter 11?  Want to swap to a different toon - 300 gems please...
---
Enlighten me why a new player with random gear would want to use templates?

Actually pressing and releasing the key are two separate purchases. Gotta do it with only half an A press.

Get your questions outta here! This is pitchfork and ranting country and these kinda posts aint welcome anymore D:&lt;

This is what happens when there isn't real vision and love at the top. Your product just becomes trash, not unlike most modern movies and series.

Way to destroy your legacy. Worse of all, they aren't even making that much money anyway. Pathetic.
---
i dont even care about them i just want to trigger people and its working
---
So they can swap to their "Stuffed Bear" template when feeling loney, duh.
---
&gt; For me GW2 is just a Singeplayer RPG. I cant remember the last time i did stuff with other people. I come back like once a year for a few days and catch up with the story.
---
Of course you'll like templates when you dont even play the game. Free stuff that you dont need is free stuff after all.
---
Because we want you to pay!
---
Wait, you hate the new version, won't pay, and will also leave the game?

*Pikachu face*

LW4 was supposed to be the "ending" for GW2, implying LW5 was an afterthought post-layoffs.

"Way better for casuals"
---
Why would you say such a horrible thing about Anet? In their live event they said build templates were, quote, "for the most dedicated players" who might even have full legendary gear. Do you have to kick anet while they're down and say they completely missed the mark like that?
---
I didn't followed any announcement or feedback about this, that explains a lot. 
---
In the end no matter the amount of feedback, not everything can happen in the end, but if they didnt do anything i can understand all the angry people.
---
I do the opposite, I Open World PVE in my WVW set. 
---
The inclination towards survivability in WVW translates very well to solo content in Open World. Am I hitting as hard as I can be? No, but I can last longer in a large mob fight, and maintain my sustain better to solo events and champs.
---
Sure but that's a whole different matter, I'm not saying their decision in regards to the monetization is correct.
---
Also even then if it is right, having a system in game available in a way where it's part of the game itself makes it fair in a sense; you could argue that ascended gear is pay to win too, yet no-one seems to be complaining.
---
&gt;Gotta do it with only half an A press.
---
GW2 parallel universe ~~Expansion~~ "Expansion Size" Living Story, coming soon.
---
For my characters who stay in exactly one game mode ever and never get used for anything else, the ability to quickly change from say, power to condi build/gear is nice.  
---
The trouble starts if you play more than one game mode, share ascended/legendary gear among characters or play more than 2-3 builds on more than 1 character since 500 gems per character on that third build gets very expensive, very fast (And playing PvE and WvW heavily will absolutely cause you to want 3 and 4 builds IMO)
---
Increase template slots: 
---
agree. I would say make ir 8, 10 or even 12.
---
Account wide unlock:
---
We already have this, it's the build bank. Of course 24 (max) slots is completely unacceptable.
---
I would make the purchase account wide (as is) but make the builds character bound.
---
So, if you buy 24 slots, you can have 24 builds for *each* of your heros. This is a glorified notepad, so this should definitely not cause any server issues. Maybe 24 builds per character is too much and noone would buy all this... And they can't touch the pricing because its already live...
---
You can txt these also, so it's not a big issue. I would definitely say 36/48 account wide builds would be way more reasonable for people with many classes.
---
PvP and WvW separate builds shouldnt be an issue. you shouldn't need to mark nothing; the game should have separate builds per modes, like it did up to monday. This shows greed and it's my least favorite part of templates.
---
Make templates actual templates:
---
For this you have template bank and chat codes; the equipped builds are fine, you can reset them from bank or text file!
---
100 gems per PoI take it or leave it ^(but if you choose to leave it then certain pois will be inaccessible)
---
&gt; Black lion chests are EXACTLY the same as most lootboxes.
---
I never said that black lion chests where good. I literally said that I would be happy to see them removed. However they contain nothing that is even remotely important to have and as such are not pay to win. They suck but they are most certainty *not* as bad as many other lootboxes.
---
&gt; How much of that is actually gameplay, and how much is sitting around listening to people talk. How much of this content is meaningful, and how much is ooh pretty environment, wish it was gameplay. The actual gameplay content from arenanet is not as big as youd think, its hidden behind fluff to make you think youre playing.
---
Entirely a matter of opinion. That "fluff" is content for the people who like story or exploration. Just because you don't like it does not change the fact that it is content. The episodes also contain plenty of things to do besides that. Events, achievements etc. have always been the majority of the content in this game and the LW episodes have plenty of both.
---
&gt; you think having employees insult the playerbase with sexist rhetoric is overblown
---
One employee and she was fired.
---
&gt; rng mount lootboxes
---
Those suck but they have 0 impact on gameplay. Hardly worthy of being called a scandal.
---
&gt; hidden spyware
---
IDK anything about that one
---
&gt; lies to the playerbase
---
Such as?
---
&gt; And lastly you must be joking. RNG dye packs, lootbox black lion chests, mount lootboxes, anets tried time and time again to make rng monetization a thing.
---
Like I already said, looboxes suck but the ones in GW2 are far from the worst. They contain nothing important or even particularly useful and are not pay to win. I would love to see all RNG removed from the gemstore but what we have is still pretty fair.
---
i dont need to pretend to know you. They were examples of the type of person you are. All whales are the same just different games. Good to know you'll be going to ruin another game after the player number drops to an unplayable state for this game. BDO would love people like you.
---
Ah, makes sense
---
I fixed all bugs by deleting the game :)
---
If I wouldn't be in a WvW guild I would just stop but we have the raid days. Outside of them I don't play anymore. Just a bit open world pve.
---
I could easily afford a macbook with my job but I'm not gonna fuckin buy one. I could afford 100 loot crates in X game, you name it, but its still fucking stupid. People saying "hahah youre poor just get a job" are teenagers who have 100% disposable income.
---
Try comparing the skins we get in game to the gemstore ones. Try to find one set that remotely compares. Those good skins? Well you can earn them ingame, with a shitload of grind. Gold to gems conversion takes forever.
---
Dude. The managers up there will literally let the game die before they admit their own incompetence and greed and change the monetisation (and the monetisation-oriented tech structure) of build templates.
---
Let that sink in.
---
This type of interaction would also be an issue for those people that are making them one at a time instead of a full set at a time. This would apply to people that are making them individually as soon as they can make one.

I guess you could, but I don't think mail parses links to be clickable? MotD does, which lets you right-click apply your builds to your slots directly from the MotD links.
---
You don't know what whataboutism means. I never said that things like lootboxes where not bad. I have not even attempted to defend them. I have. however, pointed out that they are nowhere near as bad as you make them sound.
---
You clearly *want* Anet to be bad so I'm not going to waste anymore time pointlessly arguing with you.

This would have avoided all the problems and they would have made more money because as it is with the issues between game modes, I don’t even want to play...

Slowly lurching to life - still getting code 42 errors in game and slow loading of zones.. might give it a rest for the day.
---
There is always talk of how good this community is but fuck me people are butthurt too.
---
Yes, we get it the build templates are heavily monetized and somewhat clunky, but they've got to make their money somehow. Vote with your wallets, don't buy them, that should be the opinion. All this just hurts the game's reputation even more.

I am an avid farmer. After unid gear and runic salvage I need more than 50 slots in my inventory only when I am deconstructing unid stacks or opening multiple bags.

Try to see the big Picture since we can't shatter without clones anymore a few things do not work anymore

We can't boonstrip in fractals anymore cause we need illus to do so, well noone has time to build up illus to shatter after. (Domination)
---
We can't condi cleanse in WvW cause we need illus to shatter. (illusion) Has someone seen more than one living illusion in a Zerg fight which is an actual illusion and not a phantasm.

Chrono is dead long live the wheelchairbrigade
---
I am currently setting up all my chat codes for all the builds I use in a single raid full clear on mesmer. I have 42 variations and combinations of skills and traits. (6 per wing for the nay sayers)
---
My plan is to have them organised by wing so before each wing I can load up all the build templates needed for that wing. Making the swaps easier. Equipment I am gonna have to suck up and deal with.
---
It just is a pain I have to use external tools to achieve this basic need.  A net have made a fantasticly smooth product. But it falls short in so many areas. And these are deal breaker areas.
---
You must remember all future content. More fractals, raids, LS maps and stories, WvW restruct, maybe even an expansion and lots of other cool content. Those things keep me playing every day, though I am extremely loyal to games what I have played very long time. 7 years. Every day.

I have the same problem with my minion (i'm necro) but if they are on the same cell, no more problem !

&gt;free to play
---
It's more of a trial to be honest.Way too many restrictions to make it worthwhile.
---
It's also the only real place to vent. 
---
Official Forums are safe spaces with no negativity allowed.
---
Discords are limited to relatively small communities. 
---
In-game chat lacks permanence. 
---
That leaves only reddit as a place where you can get your voice heard at least somewhat. Not just to the devs (who may read reddit from time to time), but to the general populace.
---
The mistshard and blossoming mistshard armour in dragonfall looks good and does not take much effort to unlock. Those fan design weapons (eclipse was one) look good and are easy to get. There are plenty of examples if you can be bothered to look for them. Whether or not they compare to gemstore skins is a matter of opinion. Personally I think that most of the gemstore skins are pretty shit.
---
I wouldn’t be shocked if they flat out banned it.
---
Why? Ideas are solid, you have a big account wide storage and a subselection of those can be applied to any of your characters. It might have made more sense to just keep all of them accountbound and let you apply them to anyone whenever you want, but this was either a conscious business decision, or part of the plan to not make it "too conventient" and make you forget about inventory sizes and gear management.
---
The issue is just the execution, or more precisely the extremely limiting number of storage slots and their cost.
---
There's quite a lot that's designed to create daily routines and build habits. That's a form of building a certain kind of addiction.
---
Didn't saw that till now but hey i found the solution for that bug as well....  
---
just look at 1:47
---
5k+ something hours here. Waiting a couple weeks would have made more sense, we'll see what happens brother. Any game you have in mind to fill the hole?
---
Getting a little closer to 5 now actually tbh
---
It's entirely possible that it might be NCSoft, I agree. But I don't care that much about who exactly it is, bad thing is that it does happen.
---
Okay, let's use your love analogy here.
---
Do you believe love is something you can set a firm rule for? An indisputable metric? Or that you even should?
---
Probably not, right? Love is something which is fluid. Love is something you can feel stronger sometimes and weaker in others. I think, while you can't necessarily quantify love, it's a good thing to learn more about the things you value about love. What you do love, you don't love. What makes you feel loved, what you feel when you share your love with others. You can learn a lot about yourself and your relationships when you understand what love is to you and what you expect from it. It helps you strengthen the love you have, it helps you set boundaries, it helps you identify when you're in a good situation.. or a bad one.
---
although lmao love definitely isn't just about procreation / breeding. I love listening to music. I'm not going to stick my dick in a song, though. People love family members without wanting to fuck them. You can love your friends, you can love your pets, and you can love the people you do want to sleep with as well. There's a lot of different types of love. Even if it's really driven by the need to procreate, for some reason some of these people seem to stick around together long after the procreation is done. Even after their progeny is older than they were at the time of conception.
---
and even if you did want to make it all about sex: Yeah, you can DEFINITELY set guidelines of the things you like and do not like about sex. Things which make it better, things to avoid. Understand your needs and wants and knowing how to communicate them tends to improve things.
---
And there's not really a shortage of books, or even professions, surrounding the concept of love. Selling you on the idea of it. Selling you stories about it. Selling you acts of it. One such profession is touted as the world's oldest profession, if you catch my drift.
---
***
---
So, seeing as how successful attempts at quantifying love have been over time, I suppose that means you're in full support of quantifying fun as well!
---
In all seriousness, yeah sure I get your point it seems ridiculous. It might not be particularly relevant to you, personally or professionally, but I think it still has value. It's a hard question to ask yourself, but I'm sure you can probably pinpoint a few experiences in your life, or even just gaming in general, which did not feel fun even if they were meant to be. That's the task Hopson and other behavioral scientists set out to understand. We're at a pretty early stage of understanding just how much the internet is changing the psychology of the world around us. Gaming, too, though we have a bit of a head start with the general understanding of recreation I suppose.
---
shit's not that deep though. it's just generalized guidelines to help understand that producing "fun" is not as simple as plugging in a formula
---
Well, you know.
---
Since my friends left it's not really the same.
---
Decided it's time to move on.
---
I'm glad you're having fun in the game though!
---
Excuse me? Nobody said people are being silent about it. And I'm not being silent about it either, because the more voices the better.
---
I WANT THEM TO BAD LMAO. Buddy ive put more hours into this game than youd want to hear. I built up communities. Ive helped hundreds through this game I adored. And it sucks that its run by incompetents at best, malicious folk at worse, but its facts. You plugging your ears and going lalala its not real doesnt change that.
---
Youre right the specifics of what I said are correct, whataboutism is a different thing at a base level, but you can clearly tell my intent.
---
" looboxes suck but the ones in GW2 are far from the worst. They contain nothing important or even particularly useful and are not pay to win. I would love to see all RNG removed from the gemstore but what we have is still pretty fair." How is this entire quote not defending them.
---
Does posting shit like this really make you feel better or is it just an ego thing?
---
back for me
---
The implementation is inferior to the ArcDPS templates addon (which is now gone), both in terms of usability and number of slots. Plus most of the slots available are Gemstore purchases.
---
Im sorry but i think we suck at voting with our wallet. We are on pair with EA games players as well as Fallout 76 ones.

---
I feel like there's a problem in design if you need to constantly swap builds to play a class properly.
---
DH and QB fractals are the same gear.
---
Harrier heal is the same too.
---
PvP builds don't use gear slots!
---
You are actually linking only 6 gear layouts there. With the templates as they are now you can play all those builds!
---
I can agree with that. I would still prefer ffxiv but it's definitely a valid point
---
I decided to look at them myself instead instead of reading people's 'speculations' on how bad it would be. Still don't see much of a problem outside of having more templates/loadouts to compensate different game modes.
---
Would it be possible to keep the functionality of it being slotted with a chat code function too?
---
You should try SWGOH
---
Dang unlocking is character bound?
---
That's another thing like bag slots that shouldn't be character bound...
---
Yeah but I'm a free player, I don't have access to daily log-in rewards.
---
Hey... It works.
---
I used to play my main (guard) for everything except WvW roam (because guard is "win or die" unless u do trapper dh).
---
Now i need to roll a PVP character... I don't like it but again, it works!!! There is no alternative.
---
Also why the downvotes?!
---
The people managing probably dont care/think that way. Squeeze out as much as possible from this game and invest the resources into something more profitable. GW2 is a great game but a highly money-optimized gacha mobile games will make more money in the long run and is much easier to produce and distribute
---
IMO, the best parts of the game are those that aren't hyped up.  The griffon for example wasn't hyped up during the PoF launch.  I don't recall if the mount races were hyped but those are pretty fun too.
---
When Anet thinks it "has something that can make them money", they hype it up and it turns out to be garbage or predatory.  The mount loot boxes come to mind or the wvw mounts.
---
What this shows is that there are 'too many hands in the cookie jar' or 'too many cooks spoil the broth' - this means that where there are too many people trying to do something, they make a mess of it.
---
What I think is happening is all sorts of management, marketing, sales, or non-game design roles are getting involved in making major content decisions, rather than allowing the game designers to make content that will make players happy.
---
Look at Apex Legends - they didn't tell EA about what the game was about or how it was going to make them money.  EA is notorious for injecting their decisions onto game studios but they didn't do that on Apex Legends and look how well that game did.  IMO, Apex Legends was popular because it didn't have the shit that EA pushes on games.
---
TL;DR: Anet has an issue of too many people having control over new content.  This limits the creativity and functionality for the game designers, and usually results in a giant let down for the players.
---
Or the ability to use 2 for WvW because you never play PvP? Which is my case.
---
Yeah, remember when "What is there to do at max level" was answered with "Make a legendary or farm CoF p2"? Remember when all new content was temporary, and when they refused to add new maps for ages because they were scared of spreading out players too much?
---
The good old days.
---
Isnt that how it always worked tho? your skill is on CD and you swap to a different skill for a upcoming fight it keeps the remaining cd. If the skill is off cd you can freely swap it to w/e and no cd will be added.
---
Imagine not just copy pasting arc DPS build templates into the game.
---
They put in more work for a downgrade.
---
Didn’t work, not clickable and you cant copy paste from mail
---
What exactly do free users not have access to? So far so many things have been mixed for me. The obvious ones are the expansions the Revenant class and the other two subclasses as well as log-in rewards, but what about things like chat? Apparently the chat has been really inconsistent, sometimes I type on /say and no one sees (and thus no one replies) or I whisper to a whole load of people and no one sees (and thus no one replies). I keep asking for help when mentors and people offering help are actively offering it on chat but apparently my messages are just going anywhere.
---
Of course there's the possibility everyone is just ignoring me but it's so consistent that I don't think it is people ignoring and more of a limitation I'm just not aware of.
---
Great way of nit picking the facts that support your argument. People aren’t complaining about the existence of a native template, but the limitations of it that were previously a non-issue through a third party addon. Their solution is objectively inferior to what we used to have, and on top of that they have the gall of wanting to monetize is as aggressively as it is now.
---
Worst part is that they literally acknowledged they had seen the feedback and still decided to do nothing about it. Stop blindly white knighting Anet, they’ve shown they don’t care and this whole release has been a slap in the face to their player base.
---
I think next big feature is familiars so ppl can solo stuff easier.
---
Idk but the mods are cowards for not doing anything to actually, you know, moderate the sub.
---
Maybe ArcDPS should have a 'notepad' function built into it.  This function stores all your template codes.  When you need one, it copies it to your clipboard so you can import the build.  Then you only need 1 build template and store all the template codes in ArcDPS!
---
You know that's a collection right? That makes you look even dumber.
---
You know memes involve pictures right 🙄
---
That's a different bug they fixed there.
---
Just tested it to make sure they haven't forgot to note it and well the bug is still there
---
This is normal going back years, you can pick nearly any date and find someone complaining about something.
---
If you're changing your equipment at all, you're not super casual.
---
Sounds super familiar to RS's problems
---
Quit. Nobody will miss you. Nobody knows who you are. I've already forgotten about this post. I might not even finish typing th
---
Supposedly the arcdps templates were, yeah.
---
Yeah all I want is to bind Daredevil / Deadeye to F11 / F12 for example, and then have it change traits as well as from staff to rifle so I can toggle between the both on the fly.
---
I'm no endgame player, I'm a just a casual open world and maybe a bit of fractal and WvW, and this is all I really want. So it seems they can't cater to the hardcore or the casuals.
---
Coincidentally, the game *was* originally designed with a "Henchman" mechanic... you could choose to have an AI sidekick with you which would make solo play easier, but rewards/drops would be reduced (just like if you took on henchmen in GW1). Eventually this was phased out, I don't think it ever reached Alpha.
---
why working more for something you can sell in 2 different part ?
---
I get people are complaining, but for years people have been saying they'd pay money for it, and now its here, at a cost. I know this will get downvotes
---
You can do this with macros.
---
still for MOST player is a huge benefit. this subreddit keeps on considering the 1% of veteran as the standard. it's not. many ppl never considered bringing two equip or even change stats. oh no my 4 legendary armors are less useful now... 
---
come on let's be serious. most ppl never even knew arc dps template was a thing
---
It's really down to personal taste, sadly. I *much* prefer the griffon and see the skyscale as a slightly clunky toy, whereas other people picked up the skyscale and never looked at the griffon again. 
---
The griffon is an order of magnitude less work to get, I can tell you that.
---
Are you getting paid?
---
same. how many hours have you been playing ? how many hours? suppose it's enough. if u want their server to be kept alive they have to get money somewhere
---
&gt; They delivered on the general request of the community.

They clearly didn't. This is the monkey's paw version.

If the argument is about an unfair advantage then the introduction of the built in "templates" would actually support having a template addon since there is no longer an advantage.
---
&gt; isn't there still technically a way to make one that falls within TOS?
---
Maybe but it would be a lot more difficult and still not reliable especially once lag is thrown into the mix. 
---
An integrated implementation can be made atomic which avoids some issues that can be caused by lag and disconnects.
---
Are you getting paid to be such a defender of getting milked for limited loadouts?
---
Don't give them ideas!
---
Moderating doesn't mean censoring everybody. It does mean putting up a main thread for discussion while allowing other threads only if they offer something of actual value on their own, and not having the sub be crowded by every other dude who wants to rehash the exact same points somebody else made in a thread of its own. There are some pretty good standalone topics summarizing what Anet did that isn't great and what issues they really should address, while there are others that are whole ass essays that can be "tl;dr: I'm mad" and don't deserve attention.
---
That's pretty much corporate product release and decision making 101 right there.

Have you been to Sunset Cove this time of year?  Really lovely.

WHO SNITCHED 😠
---
It shouldn't have been monetised at all. They should have worked like an officially supported version of ArcDPS - unlimited variations, uses your own bag space.
---
The people that made this made it to be monetised and that was a mistake from the beginning. This is one of the things you don't monetize - there are plenty of things they can price (like funkopops, or hey, more bag space) but build templates is the absolute wrong one. What it has effectively done is undermine the entire system in a variety of ways, directly related to the decision to build it as a monetisation feature and not a feature designed to meet the needs of the players who wanted it.
---
What is it with all these tl;dr posts stating the obvious? Everyone who gave a fuck ran away after the live reveal.

The /say chat is very limited range, basically only players whose names you can see due to proximity.  Whisper is more reliable, but free accounts are limited in who they can whisper to try to prevent spambots.  /map is off limits until you buy an expansion.
---
Other restrictions include inventory restrictions (you have two less bag slots by default), character slot restrictions (paid accounts get five as a base, free get two), and various trading post restrictions (you're limited in what items you can buy and sell there).  You've already mentioned the Revenant and login rewards.  Beyond that, you can't get Masteries, even in Core Tyria, until you have an expansion.  Masteries are the horizontal progression offered once you reach the level cap, adding gliding and mounts and other such things.  Core Tyria Masteries include the Mentor tag, auto-loot, increased movement speed in towns, and other such things.

Now even if my mantra is full at 3 charges, changing any trait will force it to cooldown. Previously, you can swap traits and the mantra will still be active at 3 charges.
---
same here (EU)
---
Ideas: 
---
Character bound loadouts instead of actual templates = Bad
---
Seperate systems for builds and gear = bad
---
Limited server saved builds instead of unlimited client side builds = bad
---
Monetizing chat code links = Bad
---
Gear storage to further monetize templates instead of monetizing extra gear bag space = Bad
---
Not seperate build templates per gamemode and not overall = bad
---
Like which idea was good? Like in your own response you give a better version than they had in 2 years.
---
&gt; They didn't have any players test ~~this system~~ anything
---
My advice, bind your Daredevil build to F11, and your Daredevil equipment to Ctrl+F11.  Then Deadeye to F12 and Deadeye equipment to Ctrl-F12.  One extra button press each, but you get what you want.
---
Maybe. But it is just a GW2 themed Clipboardmanager. If this will get you banned Anet should/must ban everyone using [ClipClip](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/7094-clipclip.html), [Ditto](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/3670-ditto.html), [ClipboardFusion](https://www.techspot.com/downloads/6864-clipboardfusion.html), or any other clipboard manager including Windows nativ one. ;)   
---
Beware if you dare using a document and than CTRL + S and CTRL + V! /s  
---
But ofc using this is on your own risk. ;) But if they ban me for this, than it's ok for me. I don't give a shit about Anet or there disgusting game anymore.
---
It's the extreme version of "I hope there are financial consquences to discourage this type of greed". When developers make game development decisions for financial reasons, the only leverage players have is financial decisions. Most people arguing they want the game to die don't actually want that, they want there to be financial disincentive for developers to exploit players in this way to discourage them from doing in the future, and to encourage good game design instead.
---
Except some are valid criticisms and complaints, and others not so much. Sometimes the valid ones are embedded and part of the invalid ones.
---
If you lack the ability to understand the difference and identify the topics accordingly, then you lose all right to complain about others complaining.
---
Lumping all complaints and criticisms into the same category makes you, and anyone else like you, an idiot.

---
At least we can still right click the legends to swap without cooldown. No reason for F1 to have a cooldown though.
---
Hurting the game’s reputation is exactly what needs to happen right now. Anet, as a company, has never been more detached from their playerbase as they are right now. Bad publicity is exactly what needs to happen to see if they finally realize that going full EA is not in their best interest.
---
The game is bleeding players, and they’re just further deepening the wound by ignoring the players they still have left.
---
Huh.  Interesting.  Thanks!
---
Sorry but not everyone who likes the feature is a casual, that's just this circlejerk. All I've gotten is maxing out my template storage and I've gotten plenty of builds per character, and I play every single class. That gives me 6-7 build templates per character. I also play every game mode.
---
Description of the system: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/build-and-equipment-templates-are-live/ -&gt; https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/91113/game-update-notes-october-29-2019/
---
If you're a casual player, you're unlikely to face the issues discussed here right now, so you can largely ignore them. For you, templates will be an upgrade in functionality, with some minor changes to the previous system (depending on your playstyle).
---
&gt; so don't be surprised when people around you leave
---
guess what? nobody will be surprised, if you guys leave because you keep reminding everybody that you will leave, you just dont do it
---
When was the icebrood saga announced?
---
When you answer yourself then think how old is the game itself, because those problems exist not since yesterday but since the freaking launch
---
Personally, I don't spend as much as I'd be willing to.
---
For example, if this was $15 a month, I'd spend it (well $30 for both my wife and I). However, as everything is broken into parts, I usually consider the individual cost (i.e. is that thing worth $5?). Due to that, I usually spend less.
---
That said (from my history panel on the BLTC)  
---
in Oct, 2500 gems  
---
in Sep, 1323 gems  
---
In Aug, 600 gems  
---
In July, 0 gems
---
In Jun 0 gems 
---
In May 1500 gems    
---
In April 0 gems  
---
In March 1480 gems    
---
In Feb 0 gems  
---
In Jan 800 gems  
---
Before Jan 2019, I hadn't bought anything since March 2018, before that one purchase nothing before September 2017 etc. I spent significantly more in 2019 than any year before since release.
---
Note that some of the above was gold to gem conversion, 400 was from the achievement bonus and 2000 gems was a birthday gift.
---
Total purchase 8203 gems, or close to 100 USD (130-40 CAD, my local currency), or about 10 USD per month on average.
---
I'm perfectly willing to spend more (for years I was subbed to WoW and/or FFXIV without issue), but as I now evaluate individual purchases, I tend to spend less. The new build templates are not worth the cost to me.
---
Yikes, you call me dumb, but miss out the part when I mention collection. Did you not read what I said?
---
Collections are pseudo quest with a lot of fetch quests gameplay, that was my whole point.
---
This is futile. You have missed every point I've made. 
---
Anyway, hope you have a good day regardless :)
---
I'm not sure their targeting the average player. One other, annoying, thing I've learned in business is that many tech companies love off their "whale" customers. If we only catered to our individual, $15/mo customer at my job, we wouldn't be able to pay for the service we give them..... That only comes to then because we have very large customers paying that covers our costs to make things better.
---
and the irony is that if anybody of my friends would show me your picture and the one they gave as example, I would know whom I would tell how awesome they looked as a kid at halloween and whom I would hug to tell them how sorry i feel because their parents were too ashamed of them to show their face in public when they ere young.
---
* GW2 can generate chat links with the skills&amp;trait templates.
---
* GW2 can write to disk and store files in the Guild Wars 2 Documents folder. 
---
* They have made changes to the UI before, meaning they can make more.
---
Therefore, it should be possible for them to add a button in the hero panel to toggle between the server-side list of 24 builds with a client-side "Template storage" that works more like GW1's and has a folder structure.  
---
If they tell us they can't do that, we can only wonder why they are lying to us, because we do not need to actually see the code of the game to know it has to be possible.
---
Open a stack of ToT bags. Crash the map if you get bad drops. Easy!
---
OR maybe its only because they are drunk.
---
This is what happens when they have crappy servers but all of the new maps focused on meta events for loot. The moment a meta ends, everyone goes to sell on TP. TP becomes slow. Add the Halloween events and you exacerbate the problem.
---
Not more than 15 minutes ago, it took several minutes to buy a small portion of leather from the trading post. It took a few minutes to buy a bank storage slot for 600 gems. When I left the Mad King's Raceway to return to Lion's Arch, even though I have an SSD, it took a solid 2 minutes to load, when usually it is less than 20 seconds. Then, when I got back to Lion's Arch, I was getting lag spikes. So yes, the server is buggered.  
---
Edit: maybe DDOS.
---
Uh let's see...
---
I've bought a number of character slots, copper fed salvage o matic, a set of unbreakable gathering tools, inventory expansions for three characters. Three bank expansions, some gem store skins and chairs, a few mount skins, living world episodes, maybe a couple other little things? I spread it out over the last three years since I came back to the game and have well over one thousand hours already. I consider it to have been largely worth my while.
---
tldr: omg we have to understand its not that simple devs work hard bla bla
---
20$ per YEAR if that. The last 2-3 years made me change my stance towards Anet and monetizing. 
---
No bl skins, no keys, no mount licenses etc etc junk. I also worked towards a Permanent Hairstyle Contract so now I have no need for selfhair kits and rarely if ever total makeover kits. 
---
No regrets.
---
https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/231273908-Troubleshooting-Trading-Post-Errors
---
do this.
---
Anywhere between 10$ to 200$ depending on a lot of factors like if I want to buy a new character slot or bank slot, a makeover or identity repair kit, an outfit or a skin, and so on.
---
Usually on the lower end though. Probably higher around Christmas because that's when I start getting gifts for my friends.
---
Following lore naming conventions isn't being unoriginal, it's being immersion-friendly. 
---
I'd take all the -dóttirs on Tyria over any "Dingle Von Fart III" any time of the day.
---
Bye now 😎
---
I play guardian  and i know all my builds by heart (except the condi ones, but i can get very close to those by reading traits).
---
Spotter vs no spotter i use butterbut curry (100 prec 70 fero) instead of sweet and spicy. It's literally the same as swapping gear (only better because it's the same exact ammount as spotter). I don't get the extra ascended bonus. Or i can swap my backpack and 2x accessories (legendary) from berserker to assassin. This and 1x +5 precision infusion gives me 100% crit.
---
For boon duration i just run full berserker if theres a boon share chrono (with the assassin trinkets if no spotter).
---
For sigils impact force is BiS in raids, and completely irrelevant at anything else, except trying for a world record in fractals, then you should definitely make custom builds / gears for each, and now with insta swap youll get even better times (unless you are doing that horrible "one boss only" horrible fad in which preboon and setup don't count (and last as long as the fight itself or more).
---
Btw i have the world record (1 sec solo) on all bosses without phases, i just trap+gg on daredevil for 40 minutes then spawn the boss and 1 shot it...
---
(Just kidding but i was with my thief friend and he literally phased cm skorvald in one hit).
---
Good for you.  Those sorts of adaptations are key to learning.  I tend to take a defensive utility on Ele whenever dangerous instabilities are present in the CMs.
---
I think I read here that this is exactly what it's doing.
---
Probably next update in two weeks when they add more gem store stuff.
---
GW2 players complain about everything
---
You say this but you basically admitted you never raid because unqiue encounter mechanics can cause you to swap builds. Or for instance on guard you might have power DH, condi FB, quickbrand power, quickbrand condi, healbrand, and then power dh traited for CC. This is all just raids and has nothing to do with content like FOTM where you might want wall of reflect, wvwvw, or spvp.
---
Yeah exactly, I never used ArcDPS, never even heard about it until the template fiasco, but now hearing what Arc provided and Anet's offering.. It's really shitty. Why do all my favourite online games get dirty with monetisation! :(
---
Not really. GW2 build storage is essentially GW1 build templates. GW2 Equipment templates are essentially the F1-F4 GW1 gear templates. The fact that weapons determine your first 5 skills throws things off
---
if i ask a famous sandwich maker to make me one of his famous sandwiches, and i tell him i'll pay for it, and i do so for years, and then he gives me 2 slices of bread with a semen spread, guess what? not happy.  
---
and then he goes "that'll be $30."
---
Thats exactly how i image it to be at anets headquarters
---
When I think that templates can't  be worse, I discover something new.
---
This is a pretty good troll post. I will give you that.
---
This game needs proper addon support like WoW has
---
It has become evident that anet is not capable. Leave it to the people
---
Reddit is for trolling &amp; drama. Don't make a mega threat it will defeat the purpose.
---
Finally, someone who isn't foaming at the mouth and is actually thinking things through rationally - a breath of fresh air at the moment. I like the broad concept you're aiming for, although I think there are some areas where there's still room for improvement. In roughly the order you mention things, along with some general commentary:
---
* Having everything in tabs rather than submenus is an interesting idea, but would probably require too many changes to long-standing UI code to be worth the effort. The current arrangement is probably here to stay.
---
* The Wardrobe idea you have is an interesting one, but probably not very practical, at least at the moment. Wardrobe Templates also probably won't be a thing, largely due to Transmutation Charges being a limited resource that ANet wouldn't want to make players consume by accident.
---
* I actually think that having Trait/Skill templates and Gear templates as separate entities is actually a pretty smart system, as it allows players to use the different elements in different ways with a minimum of faff. Still, it was a mistake to release the system without an option to link things together, and if I had to choose it would ultimately be better to have things linked than not. Here's hoping ANet makes that a priority now that the core system is out, assuming they don't focus on making adjustments there first.
---
* I'm not sure how well your ideas for Equipment Templates would work as the core of the system, however as an addition to the current system I think the idea of "templates remember the most recent gear applied to them and equip it from your inventory if possible" is an excellent one, and would make swapping around Ascended/Legendary gear much easier. This is probably the one thing I hope ANet implements the most.
---
* I believe the topic of sharing Equipment Templates was addressed during a stream before release, and it's effectively impossible at the moment for more or less the reasons you outlined. It also wouldn't do much, as unless someone had 100% Legendary gear all they could do with the link is look at it - at that point you might as well just take a screenshot, upload it to Imgur, and post a link to that.
---
Sounds a bit like the initial confusion of the denial phase
---
&gt;Even if they did store specifics and included infusions, if they were  stored in disk in individual txt or xml files it would not be a server  strain.
---
Not GW2 related, but please let me direct you here: [https://www.devever.net/\~hl/xml](https://www.devever.net/~hl/xml)
---
XML is not a data storage layer, it's a markup language. Should not store that in XML. JSON or YAML would be better.
---
&gt;This kind of equipment templates would only really work well with PvP  and legendary gear, since other PvE gear can't switch stats, but it  would still be a way to share builds with others so they can work  towards getting all the parts in it.
---
They already stated they are working on something specific to PvP for equipment templates as it is vastly different on the backend from WvW and PvE.
---
&gt;There's no need to store any specifics like weapon skin, quality or  level. The system should try to load the best weapon in the inventory or  other slots when loading an equipment template.
---
I'm with you there, but you assume their data model allows them to do that. It is very possible that it simply doesn't allow for that level of access and they had to work around it. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the directive to "Not touch the Invetory code" is behind some/most of the Equipment template limitations.
---
&gt;3 stats to be used on each type of gear (Armor,weapons and trinkets)
---
Same problem some people already have now. There are quite a few builds that use a mix of stats on the Armor alone.
---
Overall, I like your idea, but without knowing specifics about how ANet's game is built, I'm not sure we can even assume it's possible. I've made some of the same claims in the past with my jobs and end up running into "Ooooh, that's why I can't do that" moments. Usually tied to some legacy decision that never needed to be revisited prior.
---
No, they were meant to copy builds between different chars.
---
It's retarded logic because it's just retarded logic, period. Doesn't even have to do with games. If you buy whatever you want simply because you can afford it, you will quickly no longer be able to afford things. Having disposable income does not mean you just buy stuff without stopping to consider the value proposition or whether you're being ripped off. This is a concept a trained monkey could grasp. 
---
Seriously, what a stupid fucking argument. It's not the first time I hear it and it still amazes me.
---
Honestly what irks me is they haven't been working on the systems, apparently. With the consistent content droughts I thought for sure they had a team working on big things.
---
Not even. I could forgive a lack of build templates because the technology is too old if it meant we were getting teasers for elite specs that'll release in like January.
---
This whole thing feels like a very bad joke
---
&gt; They asked for feedback and such and completely ignored it.
---
the classic :-)
---
800 gems to each mount slot per character xD
---
all of the features you mentioned are mere additions. They don't really require refacturing old code. Build templates are a fundemantal change of the inventory code and data model, a part of the game that probably hasnt been touched in 10 years. I assume the testing alone has taken ages to guarantee no equipment pieces are lost. And so far i havent heard of any. so gj anet on that.
---
If devs were unable to give us something better than arcdps, then they shouldn't have work on templates. It was a waste of time when they could have worked on other important parts of the game. However, they choose to give us this useless templates to get some money.
---
If it's good enough for Mario, it's good enough for us.
---
&gt; He/she doesn't support/update it anymore not because he/she doesn't want to, it's because Anet doesn't want for a third party tool to outshine their official solution.
---
No, because it was part of their agreement from the beginning.
---
&gt; Sure, I saw their long post about how no one was actually banned because of ArcDPS, but honestly, at this point, I don't trust 100% anything that comes out of Anet PR speech. They are now at the level of Bethesda, EA and Blizzard for me. They lost my trust regardless if what they actually say is true. No way for me to prove it myself. For all I know it was a mix of both. 
---
But this "trust issue" is nothing but your own fault, if you really think that anet supports arcs templates and then "suddenly" forbid then right before they bring official templates. 
---
If so, you lied to yourself, nothing else. The requirement that Delta stop the support of arcs templates as soo as Anet get official templates were a key agreement from the beginning. Without that he weren't allowed to make templates. And more important -&gt; *we knew that from the very beginning!" If you didn't inform yourself, forgot about it or ignored it, it's nothing less than your own fault. 
---
&gt; Sadly now I am legit forced to use this mess Anet created or risk getting banned.
---
"risky" as usink TacO, arcdps' dpsmeter, GW2radial, or any other 3rd party software, yes.
---
Out of the loop here. Can't you just keep doing what you were doing and skip anet templates?
---
So much this. I can't believe people would actually complain about lore-friendly names...
---
I would have loved to buy another expansion collector's edition. ANet chose not to make another expansion.
---
That's on them. It is not anyone else's fault that they choose to monetize their game in the laziest, least consumer friendly way.
---
I bought an Extra Life Karma Booster from the gem store, and it put my Extra Life Donor Goal achi to 1/2. Do I need to buy the more expensive package for the 2nd tier or just wait until the community passes the 75,000 USD goal? (Kinda unclear from the description.)
---
&gt;I don't know what kind of a mess they're dealing with but if you're a  software engineer, you can probably already imagine how templates work  internally and they made the work harder for themselves by not saving  them locally. So your argument is that they had to monetize *every aspect*  of templates to keep their devs fed? I don't believe that for a second.  This project was already giving me goosebumps way back at release in  2012 when ArenaNet was already showing it's incompetence that has only  grown stronger over the years.
---
Every company I've worked for has had these issues to some level, even my best jobs. Simply put, a developer/company cannot plan for what they don't know yet or even changes in tech or practices down the line. You can't plan for the non-existent.
---
As for cost, Devs are expensive. Far more than 11 years ago. That's it. ANet has to be able to pay for their devs, upkeep of the game, etc and that money comes from us. We aren't paying a subscription and GW2 has always said the primary form of monetization would be the Gem Store for "convenience and cosmetic items". Take it or leave it. None of us know the costs ANet puts out and I have no idea if those quarterly reports are Revenue (which doesn't include outgoing costs) or profit (which does).
---
Tp is where you can buy gems. Interface not loading ==&gt; no buy ==&gt; business loss.
---
Was waiting for this thread.
---
But wasn't sure if it was going to be you, hinaweda or listenbird who would create it.
---
It is the first mistake they made with their system.
---
I often wondered that too, but my thought been that they maybe only want the most dedicated players who actaully goes and tries to get in at such low levels. And the rest will try later instead when they know more about the game. But that is just a guess from me.
---
I'm sorry but "Dingle Von Fart III" just sounds too good. I definitely won't name a char after it because muh immersion but thanks for the laugh
---
Where are the new underwater legendaries?
---
"Players like you are just a miniscule minority! Anet shouldn't cater to you! If you don't like it, just leave!" &lt;/toxiccasual&gt;
---
Access to the gem store is paywalled.
---
Unlocking the store will give you a sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
If they couldn't do it properly, I wish they would have just not done them at all.
---
As a more casual player, they have just made it *more* work to do the things that I now have to do manually, and they didn't add anything for the high-end players. Why did we bother at all?
---
The problem is that anet wanted to force those build templates to be tied with their 
---
 new "bag slots" so they can get more monetization out of it, the result ultimately would be an over engineered, clunky and limiting system which many players would hate and they knew it very early on...
---
There where enough ways to swap gear in much simpler ways and with less limitations, but they cared more about how much they could monetize this system.
---
And about monetizing game content/features in general i understand that you are there to earn money and pay your employers, but that doesn't justify the current trend anet is going for (and half of the game industry in general) over the last months.
---
I mean just look how much build templates actually cost, having to pay **near 400 $** if you play every profession and want 6 builds on each of them, is where it stops to be justifiable.
---
&gt; No sane company would do that.
---
I'd say rather be "insane" than being named with in line with EA, Ubi, Activision ...
---
Without even considering arcdps ever existed the current system has many flaws. The ones i have noticed by login in barely 30 minutes since they were released on tuesday:
---
1- There should be a way to tie a build template with an equipment template so you could change both things with a single key. Yes, precisely what Op mentioned.
---
2- You should be able to mark templates as default for each game mode. Either that or something like the game remembering which templetes you were using the last time you were in that game mode and swithcing to them automatically without haveing to press any key. Basically i'm asking to recover a "feature" of the old system were each game mode had it's own "build template" and apply it to equipment too. Either allowing to mark a combination as default or the game remembering the ones i last used when i waas on that game mode are good for me.
---
It's not just dev knowledge, it's also office politics. I don't know how many devs anet have, how their structure is set out or what their dev cycle is like, but if their account manager and product owner are requiring them to constantly deliver business value; it's very easy for production ready code to become legacy on arrival as there is little time to write tests and improve their platform. With the axing of the employees, it might very all be that a lot of domain experts and package owners are no longer with the company. 
---
The devs may have been begging for time to reform their platform for years but due to time and risk, it may have never given priority.
---
Yeah the mount keybinds work super well especially with an mmo mouse
---
Speaking of Clock Tower. Purchasing equipment templates inside results in you being charged, but not receiving the unlock. :(
---
I've sent in a ticket. Waiting on a response.
---
Yep, tried for a while today, adn couldn't get a game.
---
What? You can freely discuss their decision to not censor build template discussion. We're literally talking about it right now. By making a post about it. The same we you talk about build templates.
---
Here, have yours.
---
The problem is that the average player never needed this system, for the ones who wanted and needed it its way to limiting for what it is.
---
I don't need to.
---
but what does a person's spending habits have to do with how they play?
---
a whale could be perfectly fine with buying everything in the gemstore but have absolutely no use for templates
---
Well i mean i don't think there is any system anywere in life that makes everybody happy so that is a silly thought. And i don't think it have much with game time to do either, i am well over 15 k on my main account and with my alts i dont even dare to check how that is so i don't think your game time tells you what side people are in. It is more about personal preferenses.
---
Could it been done better? Sure i could. Treating it as they treat bagslots is terrible and they could have done that a lot better. They could have made different sections for WvW and PvE and PvP. There are lots of improvements that could have been done differently, but it wasn't so at this point people simply need to decide what they gonna do about it.
---
Or "Great ideas taken way too far". Oftentimes we get a more complex system than what we asked for and it just turns into this overcomplicated mess that misses the mark.
---
Happened to me on ele as well.
---
Build templates let you save a setup of weapon, armor (works with legendary stat swapping), accessories, infusions, runes, sigils, traits and skills. Currently it is 2 button presses to swap all of that, with arcdps it was 1 button. You start with 2 equipment templates (max 6), 3 build templates (max 6?) and 3 account bound build templates (max 24)
---
Essentially take the build template system that was added. Remove the limited number of slots for both build and equipment. That was the arcdps version that a player set up for free. 
---
So Anet took something people had been using for free. Made it so limited that people using arcdps templates would have to buy gems to get some of their functionality back (~$70 for 1 char and all accountbound build slots). Even after buying everything you only get 6 equipment slots per char. So if you want more you have to make multiple toons of the same class and buy the char bound slots again to get all of the functionality back.
---
&gt; All the solutions he advocates for are all common sense, to the points that it feels like the QA teams he has worked with were extremely bad or/and mismanaged for not actually adopting them in the first place (wonder if this is an actual dig to anet non existent QA :
---
Have you ever read the Art of War? "Common Sense" is great, once you've figured it out.
---
This is a good post. One of the best on the forum today.
---
Fanboy mad he can't argue in favor censoring discussion he doesn't like.
---
Get help dude.
---
I mean, if you're hearing it everywhere you go, maybe that's on you.
---
&gt; It's 37 
---
my bad the 6 missing were the cities.
---
&gt; I mean I created a few chars for raids only, but ended up by playing everything else too.
---
if you're going to play everything on those alt's what the issue? you'll get the wp eventually
---
You can use them to reset your build, after messing with it, tho
---
I made sure to use 19 characters.
---
You could actually try using that name if you wanted, if no one has used it already.
---
No, I pay 100 dollars to play a game - that's what I receive on my end.
---
lol what. and, lets say, as a semi casual, are u affected by this or is this again something that just influences the veterans
---
anyway: thx
---
What about the fuckton of "funny" "memes"? We could make start making r/loweffortGW2 a thing. To steal from u/shaman_infinitus: [we would indeed benefit from some trimming.](https://imgur.com/N1aPjXw)
---
Edit: I do agree that megathreads are stifling in general. But so are overreactions and bullshit drowning out actual debate. We got circlejerks for that already.
---
That's the thing, really. For people who didn't need them before, they're great. For the people who actually *wanted* them in the first place, they're terrible, and the terribleness increases the more you try to do.
---
Well, unfortunately, the way they're acting, they'd deserve it. Probably another massive layoff or two away from that happening though.
---
900 gems.  Just so it's just high enough where you have to pay $20 or pay $10 and waste a bit of gold.
---
"Debilitating Arc \[DPS Templates\]"
---
What I saw when first skimming the changes...
---
Ideas were solid - except if you have Legendary gear which you want to share among other characters.  
---
If you have a Necro with 6 equipment builds, and you want to use your legendary armor, weapons, and assorted sigils on, say, an Ele, you have to do the following:  
---
1. Log onto your Necro 
---
2. Right-click on each of the Equipment Builds and select Unequip All Items. I hope you have the room in your inventory, because the Legendary items have all their sigils, runes, and infusions removed. This process removes everything - aquatic breather and weapons, and all trinkets.
---
3. This destroys the Equipment Template - your character is now in their underwear 
---
4. Move the items you want to use on your other character to the bank
---
5. Log onto your other character
---
6. Get all the items - armor, weapons, sigils, runes, infusions, trinkets, etc.
---
7. Gear up your other character - reinserting Sigils, Runes, and Infusions. 
---
8. When you want to move back to your Necro, repeat steps 2 to 7.
---
Fun times.
---
Since PoF I might've spent around 200$, but my last purchase has been more than a year ago, I stopped spending on this game because I don't really like the direction they're taking. And you can buy everything you want from the gold to gem exchange..
---
That's what I thought. Coward.
---
Point is, that I shouldnt even have to open another discussion thread on this topic because a thread on it already exists (which is a mod post and sticky to boot).
---
Everything that is being said here could have been commented in the sticky.
---
I am in the same boat as you.  My best guess is that nothing has changed.  Or maybe we have a new toy to play with with an additional template? I'm pretty sure we are the vast majority of players, too.
---
‘‘feedback“
---
To do what exactly? Speed clear?  No, I suppose not, though I figure it's just easier for people to announce runs forming in guild / alliance chat rather than finding me in the friends list.
---
You can't act like a big boy when you have beta in your name
---
Anet took away those builds.
---
You actually receive more than that if you are talking about Fallout76. If you are talking about some other game then please let me know what game. You get to play the game and generally perks in addition to. But without knowing what game and what sub system it's hard to know what else you are getting.
---
There's also the fact that a single legendary rune costs more than a piece of legendary armor, although that's not actually a *bug* per se, just terrible design.
---
Roots!? Try riding your mount up some stairs ( or the ramp at Fire Keep towards the Lord's Room level) - you get stuck because your WarClaw is uncoordinated and can't lift its leg high enough to get over a step!
---
It's not like it worked better in arcpds, you always had to manually transfer gear between characters if you wanted to share it. Not what the solution here would be that wouldn't leave one of your characters naked at one point, or do you really think anet would let you just "duplicate" gear and equip it to any number of characters on your account at the same time?
---
I agree the rune/sigil situation is tricky but then again, I think that whole upgrade system is pointless, flawed and outdated, and it's not really the fault of templates, whether they're arcdps or official.
---
At least it would be nice if we could right click a skills&amp;traits tab in the Build Storage pagel, and give it settings:
---
* Automatically switch to this tab when in &gt; Open world/Fractals/Raids/Dungeons/PvP/WvW
---
* Automatically switch when switching to this tab to&gt; Gear slot 1/2/3/4/5/6 
---
This way we could link equipment slots and build slots, and build slots to game modes.
---
To be fair I think this npc should say it all year around when people show up with stupid looking characters :P
---
then that isn't a full set, is it? a full set would include underwater weapons.
---
It's something that is pissing off a minority selection of players.  They also happen to be some of the most invested into the game.  This doesn't have a negative impact on most people.  
---
Most people don't have this many builds they regularly use on a single character.
---
No, because the description of the achievement says to wait until the community passes the $75,000 goal, then go to Lion's Arch.
---
I bought karma + Aurene + *the-not-needed-potion-because-i've-got-the-perma-one-already.*
---
I don't care about the title or the karma or the mini or anything about this but to give 10€ for something good.
---
&gt; these are apples to oranges comparisons
---
This is the fundamental flaw in your analysis.
---
You argue that you can't compare GW2 to other build template systems because GW2 has a complicated gearing system. That's not a defense. **ANet designed the gearing system**. The gear/agony/infusion/mod/trinket/skin system all being directly coupled together was a CRITICAL design flaw. Every chance they had to decouple shit, they instead piled more crap into it.
---
GW2 ~~templates~~ load outs fail as a product because they aren't aren't what the clients asked for (templates) and they're built on top of an AWFULLY designed gearing system. Templates were always doomed with this gear system in place.
---
Nah, my shit is together, I'm just not a crying baby beating on a dead horse. We get it, you hate templates, Anet are evil, you're not buying, other games are better.
---
If it upsets you so much, don't buy them, wait for a free third party, or, take a break from gw2 
---
Or, actually come up with proper feedback like some people do, keeping in mind that anet is not a charity and that they need to Target the broader audience and hardly will be able to please everyone.
---
Or just keep whining on Reddit, has worked wonders hasn't it?
---
yes, it helps if your new convenience feature doesn't break existing features
---
Seeing the way this is implemented kinda understand why they never wanted to implement them in the first place. There are some obvious objective limitations that you cannot overcome that ARC templates did not have to suffer through. 
---
Pretty much never implementing this and letting 3rd programs do it was a much better solution in the long run. Makes me think that this is more of a sign that Gw2 as a game is full on its way out. No expansion, loss of workforce and CEO/Founder. Things pretty much reached the point of saying: "screw it. We cannot make things with templates ideal but we are on end of life of the game so lets just do what we can since people have been asking for it. "
---
But still this aggressive monetization is problematic. If you have objective limitations you should not be so aggressively monetizing it. It should not be free but this is excessive. I suppose that is also a sign of a game past its peak. Only way for such a feature to be justified in the NSsoft higher ups at this point in the life time of the game would be aggressive monetization.
---
&gt; You don't know what you don't know until you know it.
---
They knew it when they made GW1 before GW2, lol. 
---
This is fan boy apologia dressed up with "AS A SOFTWARE DEV" paint.
---
Happy Cakeday
---
QA can't catch every scenario people will try.  Just like Microsoft can't catch every "experiment" end users do with Windows Update.   People are complex.  I bet no one thought that someone would want to change gear to do an instanced jumping puzzle.
---
&gt; But in the current state of the subreddit, its hardly surprising, if Anet employees choose not to interact with the community over this platform. 
---
That is a pretty bad cope out. If they are not going to put out the fires while they are small then they shouldn't be complaining when it grows into a 3 story inferno.
---
That isn't even that necessary. I can live without the save button. I definitely expect one to come eventually, but it doesn't sour the other great parts of it.
---
What exactly did they promise exactly? Do be specific, with links if possible, because something tells me your putting words in Anet's mouth. Last I checked, they only promised build templates, anything specific about how they work was entirely player speculation.
---
WTF Thanks for information!
---
That's simple, if anet doesn't charge $15 a month to deliver actual content people feel fine spending $45 a month on shiny gemstore skins. I am 150% convinced this is literally all there is to it.
---
Interesting point of view. You are trying to sell that the game dropping items at the beggining of an instance is an intended result by the devs. They wanted you to have an overflow item window on screen when switching templates on the madking JP lobby. 
---
Im sorry, but as much as you can understand the "why" behind something doesn't mean it's always intended.
---
There's several major problems with its current implementation that center around its predatory pricing model. At the end of the day, most of us expected some limitations in the technology, but the pricing model is absolutely ridiculous for the limitations we're given. The game is also designed in a way to encourage you to have a "main" that multiroles, but then they penalize you for doing so with the new build templates.
---
That is good to know. I still would never test this with a legendary inside. *gr*
---
at this point EA looks like the lesser evil. their monetising practises aren't as bad and they release functional games (except anthem xd), they are also prone to huge community backlash whereas anet seem to just shrug it off and continue on their course for the cliff that is rapidly approaching.
---
Why do people need a radial menu when they can just bind the mount to a key?
---
It's difficult to call what FFXIV has "build templates," because the idea of actual builds is almost unknown to the game. What it has are basically slots that save a specific class with a specific gear setup (since a character can be all classes, and you'll often find yourself swapping between them to keep things feeling fresh). There's nothing like trait lines or utility skill choices, and the job stone that upgrades you from the base "class" into a proper "job" isn't really a choice (like an elite spec is) because having those job stones equipped is what gives you all your skills after level 50 or so. Also, FFXIV is a vertical gear progression game, not a horizontal gear progression, and while you can be selective about armor in an attempt to get a high value in a particular stat (like Black Mages do with spell speed), in general, weapon damage and your main damage-related stat far outstrip anything else in gearing consideration. GW2-type questions like "Hmm, should I build in more boon duration with Diviner's gear? And if so, how many pieces?" are completely foreign to the game. Meaningful gearing choices that would have a noticeable impact on a class's playstyle don't exist there, because the design team aims for a fairly rigid balance, and they've actually taken measures recently to reduce the amount of synergy that exists between the classes, so as to prevent any one class from being seen as a "must-have" in endgame content.
---
I have no commentary on the GW2 build template system, as I haven't really dug into it much yet, but I keep seeing these comparisons to FFXIV, and I'm like, "FFXIV has builds? That's news to me."
---
&gt;Now they are as horrible as any mobile gaming scam studio.
---
Hell I'd consider Anet's practices worse than the actual good mobile games.
---
People can hate on mobile monetization all they want but when you look at the actual huge ones like Fate or Granblue people still love and play them regardless. They know what they're getting into and everything is very clearly defined and within practice. There's little deviation and everything is perfectly playable even without spending the money.
---
Then you have Anet come in and decide to monetize every last little feature they can. They put the over whelming majority of cosmetics in largely cosmetic driven game behind the shop. The in game things all have a huge gold price tacked on so that if you end up having to pick between that and just turning that gold into gems to buy a probably cooler looking cosmetic off the shop anyway.
---
Dopey engineer think that completely missed the fact that games are art, and therefore very subjective and can not be measured objectively.
---
Very messy essay does little to make a mark or contribution to making  more fun games.
---
I'm pretty sure template weren't at gw2 launch because it would've been an horrible mess do deal with skills tied to weapon slots, etc... 
---
Times passing, community ask for it, they face arguments, even very good argument and player pressure.
---
Then then come back on their initial decision. We don't have since the launch because it looks like horribly difficult to implement without massive trades offs, or non-economically viable development path.
---
But they are still trying it. While I'm not ready to support their feature in their gemstore in this state, I'm really happy to get it now, but I would also encourage them alot into pursuing into a more functional system (i.e legendary gear, PvP, wvw,etc, more work around acc binding)
---
And there,I'll gladly spend gems for a feature that shouldn't be monetised.
---
If you can't see why anet wouldn't ever let you just share your entire equipment loadout across all your characters without any additional work being required except buying a build template, then you can't really have an objective rational discussion about the subject lol.
---
Now go through my comment history. Come on, keep following the script.
---
So... your suggestion is they make less money? You're fired.
---
/s, in case that's necessary.
---
What was the deal with laurels?
---
Arc gear templates meant you could actually use the versatility of legendary gear stat-swapping. Trying to manually swap stats was just absolutely cancerous from the start.
---
Just make it so it always triggers when infusion stackers or players wearing obnoxious armor combos are near the npc. Okay thanks Anet!
---
How is this worse than no templates at all?  Why can’t you just keep doing whatever it was you were doing before?  Don’t use any of it. Don’t buy anything. You no worse off than you were a week ago.
---
Are you ok?
---
RemindMe! 48 months
---
You can actually double up on the same equipment across multiple builds. My thief has the same armor and trinkets slotted in and only swaps weapons when I want to jump between daredevil and deadeye
---
ah yes, monetizing something before it's even done. a real Kickstarter goal
---
It doesn't matter if you are casual or hardcore. Do you carry armor, weapons and/or trinkets in your bags to swap to? Do you use 7+ equipment combos (including just swapping out weapons) ? Then this build template system is worse for you than the arcdps templates.
---
rightfully so...
---
everyone was expecting that the moment we saw some details on that and them changing nothing with weeks of massiv feedback and criticism.
---
We can revisit the subject if they ever create a zone-wide meta-event about seducing Rytlock.
---
Simply because there is a reason for deficiencies in a product does not excuse that the product is deficient.
---
Regardless of the reasons that led to this particular implementation and monetization scheme, it failed to achieve customer expectations in multiple areas.
---
Whether the reasoning is intra-office politics, lack of resources, in-experienced staff, or ancient undocumented codebase, or some combination of those, this product was approved and monetized and released.
---
And in my opinion, that product is unacceptable.
---
Oh. I didn’t know there were 3rd party build templates. I’m a good bit too casual for that.
---
They did the same with Shared Inventory Slots so why wouldn't they do it here too?
---
Anet took something that was part of GW1 and something that a third party mod did for free in GW2 and made it a huge cash grab, in short. 
---
In long, ARCDPS had a feature that allowed you to save and load in templates for traits, skills, and gear. One click swapped them all. They were static unless you clicked to overwrite them. You could store an unlimited amount of templates.
---
Anet's "build templates" are more like loadout tabs, meaning that you can't tweak them and go back to the saved templates unless you save it to the account-wide build template tabs. There is a max limit of six build loadouts. You get three for free. Expanding it costs 300 gems and only applies to the character.
---
So, for people who have multiple builds for a toon, this severely hampers their ability to manage their builds if they were using ARCDPS before. Additionally, Anet removed the automatic build swapping when going into PvP or WvW, meaning that players aren't really gaining build templates so much as Anet made it so that the two they had are now "freed up" to use for PvE modes if they don't PvP or WvW.
---
Since Anet made ARCDPS stop updating the build templates, the community is losing a very useful tool that's been replaced by something with worse implementation, costs gems, and hard limits.
---
SEE?
---
Even called loadout in the code!
---
The downloads every update isnt a good indicator on how many actually use arc dps.
---
There are tons of people who update very rarely or just play inactive/infrequently.
---
Bgdm posted the numbers for his tool way back then i think tho.
---
[As usual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6htT-aVJup4)
---
Every hardcore player will tell you that all you need is full berserkers in every slot, the rest is casual garbage you need to unlearn.
---
Right..?
---
Or 45 minute WP video discussing the discussion.
---
then whatever happens here is irrelevant anyway
---
I guess its also depends on which maps you play more. I would say Griffon is better for HoT maps while the later LS maps from PoF would favor skyscale.
---
Yeah, and unfortunately they were a lot better than Anet's current first party stuff, and they were free, and we had them for a long time (over 2 years I believe).  Its a really unpleasant situation.
---
man, all this talk about bugs with templates really changes my perception on how others play :P (I'm a bit of a neat freak, so full / nearly full bags would bug the crap out of me)
---
HoT is clearly peak GW2.
---
I am not a hardcore veteran, but I did use ARCDPS. It was super useful to swap the builds of my main between open world, raid, fractal, and WvW modes, with different weapons. I also had different sets for solo or group play. This update pisses me off and feels like a half-baked attempt to implement build templates to fleece players for money. 
---
If there were no limits on the amount of build templates and build and equipment template expansions were account rather than per character, that would at least be a step in the right direction.
---
Except the game is being riddles with exploits as we speak. Apparently theres a way to enable the archepass from messing with the games files lol. I couldnt recommend AA:U in it's current state
---
when people find out anet is going to charge money for the icebrood saga.
---
You analyze/perform feasibility first, and then you plan.
---
I was more concerned that this latest drama seems to have largely overshadowed all other topics.
---
To be fair Arenanet aren't doing themselves any favours by having the in-game event bugged out though - I'm sure having a nice buff appear on your character would help people remember or ask what that's all about.
---
You have no argument, so you fall back on shaming. I don't give a shit about your opinion of me.
---
&gt; It was just not designed
---
It wasn't designed with anything in mind. That's why it's shit and constraining the future development of the game. That is the opposite of 
---
&gt; Gearing system is made properly and works perfectly.
---
You say it's perfect then immediately point out a flaw. How can you so flagrantly contradict yourself in two sentences?
---
It would be nice if you could earn some of those extra ones in-game, like how you could earn bank tabs in GW1 by completing a campaign. 
---
* Choices to obtain the free tab #1: 
---
 * Complete personal story and season 1 &amp; 2.
---
 * Complete a new PvP/WvW track once.
---
* Extra tab 2: 
---
 * Complete HoT and Season 3.
---
 * Complete the new PvP/WvW track three times.
---
* Extra tab 3: 
---
 * Complete PoF story.  
---
 * Complete the new PvP/WvW track six times.
---
Completing the story would unlock the tab directly, completing the tracks would give you a token, then you would go to a vendor that sells the tab for 1, 3 and 6 of that token as you do the purchases.
---
GW2 is more CPU-bound (single-core) than GPU-bound so the higher your CPU clock the better performance you'll get, sounds weird to be getting such low FPS on empty zones/low graphics though.
---
I play on a 3700x + RX570 at 1080p and the game usually keeps my GPU at 50%, it is not that GPU intensive so even at 4k it shouldnt require a top-tier card.
---
What clock is your CPU running at when you're playing?
---
to answer your question as constructively as i can: yes the game is dead
---
I know a lot will rush to judgement because of how this looks, but take a moment and calmly look at it. This is actually a bit of a testament to Anet's development.  One thing they told us in the guild chat was that there were many safeguards in place to prevent accidentally losing gear.  They seemed terrified of fucking that one up.  Although this is certainly scary for the user, and I can understand why OP panicked that they would lose gear if they exited to lions arch, and obviously a bug caused all the gear to unequip, the safeguards did do their job and protect the gear.  
---
Of course, we would all prefer a world where every single niche case is tested.  But, in what appears to be an untested environment, the safeguards prevailed.  That is certainly a testament to the people who made the safeguards.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boiling_frog
---
Doesn't PvP equipment also have a rune and sigil selection in addition to the amulet selection? Just a very minor nitpick on an otherwise excellently designed proposal, should be easy to add.
---
in regards to giving meaningful feedback yes.
---
It still holds entertaining value though (at least for some)
---
And I was thinking of mentioning that about loot boxes. Yes, they added in the selection license, but their first instinct was the gambling money grab. And they didn't even get rid of it. They added a more expensive option as an alternative to shut people up, and gambling is still present in the game.
---
And yeah, build templates might change... but look at everything leading up to these changes. The announcement and presentation in a booked hall for.... nothing, basically. It is still early, and things may still change - you are correct, but this feeling I'm having goes way beyond simple things like this.
---
It feels like the devs aren't having fun making GW2 anymore, and that takes the soul out of the game.
---
This is really good to read. I don't care much about the update since I don't play actively anymore, but I had an idea how to solve the issue with legendary gear. I would like to have "Legendary gear template" where you can store all your legendary items and the classes that are allowed to use them would automatically load that gear into the "character gear templates". Now I believe this won't be possible since the game was not build to be account bound.
---
This is why I'm heavily considering FFXIV so I can rest my hands with a controller...
---
You get three build templates and two equipment templates per character with three account wide storage spaces for the build templates that can be shared with characters of the same class (with three extra free ones at the moment in the gem store)
---
ummm isn't it their actual job to think of these obscure places so that things like that doesnt happen?
---
maxing out a character with templates already costs 2.9k gems. that's over 35 bucks worth.
---
oh so they do know the difference between templates and loadouts
---
Well yeah its a sad development in the game industry in general and with mmos being a dying genre.
---
A bit part of it started with the mobile games movement and how easily you can abuse people on this platform with manipulative and aggressive monetization via microtransactions.
---
While they only have to offer mere bare bones games compared to other platforms and people still senselessly trow money at them.
---
They dont haven have shame to make underaged kids addicted to gambling, where many life are destroyed by this, even fighting for it to so they can abuse them even more.
---
they're still allowing posts about templates.... there's nothing to "discuss" about the mod post it's just a PSA telling people to stop whining about template posts so i can see why that's locked
---
unless I'm missing something?..
---
I guarantee you the $30 that you spent on PoF did not cover the cost of developing  the expansion
---
True, I hope it gains more traction, but knowing this sub, it won't get far.
---
To be honest you should not have relied on a 3rd party program in the first place, there was always the possibility that Anet would disallow it at some point.
---
or they're just incompetent
---
You are a shit person. Just so that is clear.
---
Yeah, exactly. And even outside of the blatant moneygrabbing ideologies, GW2 and games in general just don't feel fun anymore. They feel like an illusion of fun.
---
&gt;And you do realize that companies are meant to make more money, right?
---
This argument is infuriatingly dumb. For one, it's stupidly obvious. Thanks, we know that companies exist to make money. Second, it's not really an excuse for anything. Companies are meant to make money, but you can definitely have concerns about how they make that money; to just shrug and say "well they're meant to make money" as if that justifies every mean is just beyond stupid.
---
Sadly, I don't have second machine; all what I can show you is [the notification](https://i.imgur.com/jmzAxBE.jpg) from my firewall - as you can see, now it calls for slightly different address
---
I'm aware that Trident is being used in various Windows software and even system components to render stuff but such situation shouldn't happen - especially when application doesn't require network connection at all. Maybe it's some telemetry within dotnet?
---
All the upper part of the industry does this. Costs have been going up with inflation and larger competition and more difficult vast "realistic" environments as goals, but consumers are not psychologically ready to pay more than a certain ingrained number for games, so they have to resort to such "tricks".
---
For one, just remember the original uproar at HoT announcement, after which moderately priced gliders came out, and how they had to decrease the price for PoF to then wind up prices for premium mounts and lootboxed mounts.
---
Cause evade spam.
---
It always depends on what your keybinds are. Not everyone have the keys you have mentioned "free". Personally I those keys I've put the keybinds for the new templates.
---
for me it's more like they're just stubborn. It's been like that since they introduced ascended gear.
---
Thx for the tip, there is no reason to be outraged thow.
---
Legit false advertising?
---
It suggests that they won't have to put any effort into developing another expansion for their game. They can just skate by on the paltry, lackluster piecemeal story releases from now on.
---
why would i care about my gear/build in the jp?
---
It would be nice if you got 1 build template plus 1 for pvp and wvw(already existed), then 1 for each expansion you own. 5 build templates default would have really mitigated this problem. I wouldn't doubt the additional templates are for possible inclusion in the future with non-individually-purchasable content.
---
That's what. $680 USD for 9 people? Fuck that noise.
---
&gt; And there's nothing left in the game to come back to.
---
And there's no one left in the game to come back to either.

Being disheartened casual vet is awkward position to be in. I want to be excited for future community interactions but can't force myself into that mindset long enough to reach out. I suppose it's maintenance mode until my will to stay in touch with GW2 turns to dust.

I sincerely hope you'll find a game, or something different altogether, that will ignite you like gw2 used to.

The mount controversy has always felt stupid to me. Put it this way. Imagine if they added a vendor ti Amnoon that sold you a Mysterious Egg for \~177 gold? You take that egg and you hatch it and it's a mount skin! Can you imagine the reddit posts? People would be going insane "ANet finally listened to us, we can earn mount skins in-game!"

ANet's management are almost certainly the ones who designed this system, leaving the devs to figure out how to implement it but probably largely out of the process of designing its core functionality and monetization.
---
What people seem to be taking the most issue with isn't the implementation - the core design philosophy of the entire system and its predatory monetization is the primary focus of current player ire. ANet reeks of shitty management, not shitty programmers.
---
Some unmaintainable code is inevitable given a large enough project, but if your project is accumulating unmaintainable code with every release, I think it's much more likely to be a result of management failing to understand the necessity of dedicating resources to upgrading and refactoring the project's core code (especially the oldest code) than it is to be a result of every programmer at ANet being inexplicably unable to maintain their code.

This, along with the insane time it took to develop (more than 1 year and a half), make me question some things. I know they have spaghetti code, and I know because of my job how some things that look simple may be huge depending on the actual existing code. But to make something like those templates require 1.5+ YEARS of work (even assuming it's a single dev) ? That's a stretch. Then you add a few ways it breaks, especially the one in this post. I wonder if the dev in charge made something like actually changing all the things in the game that read equipment/build stuff to work, one by one, maybe forgetting some (mad king tower / maybe activities systems in general) ... instead of adding an abstraction layer between the templates and the rest of the game to make it transparent for all existing systems. As bold of an hypothesis as it is, it'd explain both the long dev time and some of the bugs.

And then there is the limitation to 24 storage slots that make build storage nearly moot. Either it was entirely driven by monetization, they were afraid that many people would not fill more than a few storage slots and they couldn't have a too big difference between free slots, unlock pack size and total max slots. Or, it's simply because the dev in charge made a database table with as many columns as templates (it's been confirmed that they use relational dbms, maybe oracle), maybe multiplied by number of info per build, making it a fixed amount of builds per account and maybe hitting a limit (though it's 1000 on oracle, just checked google and found a guy who wanted to store 5 minutes interval data in daily rows with many columns, I cried). I really, really hope that this stupid hypothesis is just a stupid hypothesis. But tbh my faith in the average anet dev (not the few prominent guys) has decreased over the years.

A guy on our team got the map selection bug where it won't go away. He relogged. Then he got this bug. It was a sad display of game design.
---
Original skill trees were archaic at launch, felt a bit like a placeholder from prototype phase (it worked but was mostly irritating). They had an option for a complete rework with new trait system but they opted for quick fix and now we have this mess. 
---
In all honesty they should have waited with equipment templates for a month or two and test problems just on the skill tabs, but December is close so gotta rake that Christmas money. Also in-game notepad as a paid feature is a disgrace.
