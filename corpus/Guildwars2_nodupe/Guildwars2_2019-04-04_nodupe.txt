Looks like fun! Is Any way those of us who aren't 80 year can participate?

Or what :o
---
Mesmer is ANET's little baby since GW1.
---
Eh, don't mind it. It's just a sad little troll.
---
It still works. I'm using it for the current festival.
---
Personally I find it distracting and that it takes away from a lot of the exploration of the game, which is one of the best parts as a new player. But I'm not above turning it on for specific guides and festivals.
---
Kind of "Nice to have when you need it, but relying on it isn't great."
---
I crafted 10k elder wood planks and share your pain.
---
That's just how the class goes. There is a skill that transfers them but it's not all that useful.
---
If you watch closely you'll see that clones do basically 0 damage. Clones are your ammunition. They feed your shatter skills and have basically no other use. Ideally, they only live for a few seconds before you use them.
---
View them more as a resource to be managed and spent rather than an AI assistant.
---
A lot of things they're doing were probably already in the works. They simply didn't talk about them as a matter of policy. Just because they've now said something doesn't mean it wasn't already planned. The difference is now they're communicating.
---
Something they should have been doing all along. Now it’s too late.  A lot of the players have left, most of them aren’t coming back, and no one cares anymore. 
---
Communication is progress!
---
Interestingly enough, Firebrand can do all of that save for alacrity. And forcing permanent uptime of all boons, which you forgot to mention. 
---
while crafting a legendary component or ascended armor. There should be an audible Gong for the player(or players) congratulating you. I just find it strange that you spent so much time and gold on an item only to feel like its a wet fart in an elevator.
---
What I noticed in the one week of WvW I played. Queue up as scourge, finally get in, join squad, notice lack of firebrands. I could swap to firebrand but I would have to go back in queue. Nah..
---
Give players a time window of 1 minute to swap characters once they are in the map.
---
To add to this:  
---
You can also provide 10 man perma protection without a stone spirit. Especially valuable at VG where spirits die way too quickly while skipping greens. You need someone in your subgroup that provides fury in this case so that you can spread it onto the rest of the squad (one of the rare cases where it can be good to have druid and tempest in the same subgroup if noone else can give a fury primer for the tempest). Also Rebound which is rediculously good at certain encounters.
---
To play devils advocate, the time cost of refining should stay and you can buy pre refined mats from the TP. You pay with time or gold. Refined mats get no love on the TP and even now usually trade at a discount to their corresponding raw materials.
---
Thinking about downloading taco for help with faster map completion.  I get mixed results when I try to search if it is allowed or frowned upon by anet since it is usually mixed with general conversation about people getting banned for various reasons, not necessarily talking about taco.  Basically my question is for people currently using it: what makes you comfortable using it?
---
We asked for this many many times but not got any response about it even. Being able to swap would make all the difference. Sometimes you wait in queue and the com on ts say we need more necros or more firebrand but noone in the queue can swap because i am spot 37 and waited for 30 min already. It would be such a quality of life change for WvW to have this.
---
Wizards Tower
---
Well that's still the case for pvp, you can't queue then change maps or it leaves the queue.
---
Kinda obvious no?
---
I normally use custom CSS in RES to block everything karma related on this sub.  After seeing this, I disabled RES, reloaded this page, and used the karma voting system for the first time in more than 5 years to downvote this nonsense. 
---
I thought we were winning the statue.
---
The mount has 13k or so health, and barely any armor rating, so any long-range Burst will dismount the zergling. When dismounted by damage you get a 2s knockdown on you, which gives the roamer (you) time to burst them down. Clipping tails is still a thing, I think the classes may have changed (mesmers, rangers and thieves excel at it, a lucky Herald also stands a chance, while eles and guardians primarily fill a troll-them-till-your-+1-shows-up role)
---
 being too early on a trade is the same as being wrong 
---
Not in WvW anymore!
---
Trash
---
This game is very forgiving when it comes to story mode and low level fractals.  Just throw yourselves at the dungeon and see what happens :D I guarantee you will finish the dungeon with 3 people.  I have soloed a few.
---
It can vary a lot depending on the amount of data you give them, so not really, but having to wait a few days to a week is not unheard of.
---
I haven't tried a chrono, condi quickbrand and diviner renegade comp yet. I think this should be the better for coordinated groups.
---
It's almost like the layoffs weren't in vain
---
What in the name of Joko is happening! Anet communicating! Something done for raids!!
---
Your sensitivity is showing.
---
That word does not mean what you think it means.
---
Why would they do this? They potentially  get income from gems to gold and without raid selling, hardcore casuals wouldn't get those aps.
---
Don't know why they would do it. I don't care about bad rich players getting their armor but adressing raid selling was the first thing that came to my mind when reading changes to the way to recieve raid rewards.
---
What can they give though? I mean I understand why jewelry would make sense...you could craft ascended trinkets etc, but why cooking?
---
Thank you! 
---
i thought I saw something like either #2 or #3 in there that might be more up my alley though - for boss timers &amp; such.
---
Your help has been invaluable, thank you!
---
Most of the people laid off were probably not working on Guild Wars 2. They said as much and we only listed about 20 people laid off from GW 2 that we know, compared to over a hundred laid off. I don't think plans have changed that much, but it's just an opinion.
---
I read kale and I’ve no idea why.
---
Is there a way to know future sales in the next week or two? Maybe discount or new items like the Gliders and chairs. I have enough gem to get an outfit i want, but afraid that if i bought it, a new item / sale gonna appear that i want to get but can't afford.
---
pre-refined only has its value from leveling up your crafting.
---
Try 3 condi necro(pref scourge) with epidemic(utility skill), it's pretty accessible as class and you don't even need to buy super expensive gear, dire(condition,toughness,vitality) works just fine; If you guys find that condi necro is fun, y'all can grind for better gear like viper or traiblazer!
---
The option could be there for those who do, since otherwise someone would have to buy a new account and unlock everything else again. In a way, this could also ameliorate the issue of NA being empty at day/easily dominated by the few servers with SEA guilds. inb4 they make it a gemstore item
---
In the post you linked the user was banned only after they switched to windows. ANet is obviously not banning people for using windows. The truth is going to be hard to determine. ANet makes mistakes and cheaters lie. :/
---
While I do not personally agree with your view on the necessity of such booth art, I can understand your point, and regardless, I agree that it's rather silly and juvenile to be happy about *an advertising object being made for a commercial product from the money of its customers*.
---
That's just pure **business** - and art of many types has, for a long time, been part of business.
---
If that's how you feel, then you may be soulless, unable to feel joy or happiness at all, in need of a slap, in need of an intervention, or at a point where it's time to stop and reconsider your life choices up until this point.

it is, but being in Australia its sorta sad that unless your big dev studio they wont have a presence.

This had a really quick turn around

I just had a friend pick up PoF through that site just now, and the code it gave him didn't work. Before we go to customer support, do you have any idea what may be the issue?
---
If this kind of robotic soullessness is what "grown up, realistic and practical" looks like, then I both pity you *and* hope that I never ever become any of those things.

I wonder what the world did to you to turn you into... well... *this.*

Quickbrand Renegade combination is flat better right now. Requries no well done Well placement and delivers blocks on demand while dealing more damage than a Chrono. If you change up the equip, since you dont want to deal dps for a reason your Firebrand will be a second healer in the group.
---
The only reason you dont see more of them is that PuGs hate change and that there is enough Chronos that played their class for 1k hours and acutally like to play them.
---
because seeing someone sitting alone in an empty room facing a corner and loudly eating green death balls is definitely an uncomfortable experience
---
monkaS
---
Why is this tagged as "event"? Lul
---
It kinda looks like an asura experiment.... and for some reason I want one anyway. 
---
Yeah. No. Firebrand does everything a chrono does but giving alacrity. He also doesnt need to place Wells for his Quickness to be delivered, making it a lot less forcast heavy than a Chrono. 
---
I know its hard to swallow for all the people how dont look at skill trees and what other classes are able to deliver, but Chrono right now is only in a good spot for speed clears, where you dont bring any healer but one Druid for primarily might and spirits. Firebrand Renegade is far superior in every other case.
---
More healing, more blocks, easier boon application.
---
It does that sometimes.
---
And when we try to remove the tag, it just comes back???
---
Do the tanky trio: warrior, ranger, necro
---
That doesn't look like Guild Wars: Utopia.
---
Classic Reddit. Oh well.
---
Wish I had legendary armour on my Mesmer now
---
Yeah. No. I wasn't saying there wasn't anything comparable. I was saying it was good at too many unique things mechanically.
---
Didn't say anything about boons.
---
TBH build templates won't really affect open world pve. Raiders and wvw will like it since they use different armours and anet doesn't seem to care about player retention in those modes so I assume they'll just charge for it.
---
Its in the near vicinity of the table.
---
That type title usually has a negative connotation i read it that way as well.
---
Thought Mirage mainly got Pvp'ed nerfed
---
Seems I missed that small detail...
---
Thx for updating me on it! :)
---
[removed]
---
[Cry of pain](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cry_of_Pain) was reduced from 2 to 1 in all modes and that was a big hit for it since it spammed clones and confusion.
---
The discussion is often an echo chamber for a non popular opinion. Dont like raids how raids are currently designed? You dislike how the global balance is handled. You find certain elements of the game to feel out of place.
---
Theres rarely a discussion. Just the popular opinion voiced and then downvotes.
---
Best build to use for raiding as a necromancer?
---
Cant really decide which one to gear up on...
---
Generally, you want might, fury, quickness, alacrity and then burst damage, good cleave, cc and finally a bit of safety via utility (stealth and maybe some off-heals). Banners are pretty helpful if you can squeeze it in, so is a spirit. You'll have to make a trade-off at some point.
---
You can get there via multiple ways these days: firebrand + renegade is a great package, paired with a full dps or another hybrid such as Warrior. Alternatively Chrono + Warrior + DPS is a great combo. If you want safety, druid is nice but it's really boring to play outside of instanced combat.
---
If you want to translate somewhat smoothly into instanced content (fractals, raids), then fb + ren + warr/dps or chrono + soulbeast (who can play druid) + warrior are both amazing. Dungeons work a little differently because skipping mobs is more important and for that Chrono is great. Raid groups usually run Chrono, Druid and Warrior, fractal groups have seen fb/ren/warr/soulbeast overtake the old comp although Chrono/druid is still a very good and solid option. As I said, at some point you'll have to compromise.
---
If you only care for open world, I'd say run what you enjoy but also at some point the game will throw ascended trinkets and weapons at you.
---
Yeah scourge uses mix of shaman and Marshall (called salomon I think on tp) which is cheap on the trading post. Also a magi heal scourge version. There a viper DPS version which is harder to gear.
---
Power reaper uses all berserkers (think zhed on the tp) and rotation is super easy, but no idea how accepted it is in groups since it was very low on damage
---
Support scourge. Not Meta but can carry a learning group with all the heals/barrier.
---
It's their love child since GW1. Few if any other MMO offer a class of a similar archetype. So I guess they just feel more attached to it cause of it.
---
is that 1:1?
---
If you have already completed the level 80 HoT story on another one of your characters, gliding will be automatically unlocked for all of your other characters. However, unless you finesse the system, you won't be able to have gliding before level 80 :[
---
Awesome! I pride my trains on being new-player friendly, so I hope you won't have too much trouble follow along :]
---
I definitely pride my trains on being super new-player friendly! While we won't repeat HPs more than 3 times usually, I pace the running part enough to where everyone has a good chance at getting the challenge in the first or second restart. We don't take our time, so to speak, but I've done this plenty to know the pacing of those without mounts! :D
---
Whoo! Well, you'll definitely get plenty in this train and you'll be spending quite a bit of time getting all the exp to use up the mastery points you get :D
---
RIP.
---
It's ok. Sleep is for the w e a k .
---
Much appreciated &lt;3
---
Yeah, I'm looking to get partnered by Anet at some point, since one of the benefits is swapping freely between the two servers. Once that happens, I'll definitely try and run this for EU folks as well!
---
we will fly aurene into kralkatorrik in the mists, their spirits will merge and aurene will encapsulate kralks mind. then in tyria his physical form (whilst flying through the air) will suddenly collapse and fall from the sky. then from behind the mountain we will see it rise and it is now blue and its kralkataurene 
---
True
---
Sounds good \\o/ If you have the time, I run these every month, so you can always take another toon on another run &lt;3
---
upvoting this before it gets downvoted by people who dont want to participate in it
---
Thanks, I do feel sad but you made me smile a bit
---
This would just make off hours more dead and peak hours more crowded if I follow your logic, I don’t see how it helps. Stuff like offer extra pips or reward track progress during off peak hours sound better imho
---
Was this change prompted by the complaint topic I read a few days ago in the subreddit, or has it been a problem for a long time? It's a great change, but very quick if only discussed this week.
---
Given that the content they have said will be coming is less than in the past, no.
---
Flashback to Guildwar 1 where you could grab a second profession and become a necromancer.
---
Hey /u/ANET_BenP  Is something like this even possible.  Assuming the WvW queue system works entirely different from the PvP version.  Thought I'd ask since you've had experience in both modes.
---
I feel like once they're in the game they're bound to play a role in any new expansion. Especially if the new map areas offer a specific type of terrain challenge to conquer. People were speculating that if we get a Bubbles story sometime we may get a water mount (underwater) and honestly I like that idea. Swimming takes a long time and I'd love to have something that makes it easier
---
Well overall I agree with you. And specially annoying since they removed all those ls1 AP which gave a lot more than current achis
---
Some reason I thought it was the line post processing creates..
---
I took a picture on it, it's actually bigger than in-game and it's pretty impressive up close, as it has leads with a breathing effect :) 
---
I really liked the color scheme of sunrise so i decided to craft it, in particular for my mesmer. However, i ended up not using it on any class, not even on my mesmer as i end up playing either support chrono or condi mirage, neither of which can effectively use greatsword. You can make the argument that it has a place on chrono but i never use it.
---
I ended up crafting eternity and selling it.
---
None but I guess I wish I could use juggernaut more. 
---
*goes to corner* /cry
---
Wife refuses to let me out of her sight. Takes offense at headphones.
---
Honestly, none currently. Although I hated Sunrise when I first made it because I mailed thief and none of my characters that could use it were characters that I actually enjoyed playing. Warrior wasn’t that good yet and ranger GS was sketch. I have a feeling that after I’m finished making Nevermore, that I won’t like it nearly as much as I should 
---
Eternity 
---
Because it costs so much and I could have sold either sunrise or twilight.. plus I am not really using greatswords that much
---
Honestly the meta is pretty good imo, still needs a little work on the new mounts which they plan to change. If your group is organised and good you'll stomp any pug zerg but yes, it still turns into a battle of numbers when the enemy zerg is 50+ to your 20. As for raids, condi DD is [not as strong as it used to be](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) but is still viable especially with teh new steal skills being strong on bosses.
---
Ever since Feel My Wrath was added to Guardian, people don't bring Mesmer for reflects and time warp anymore. It's only worth in dungeons for portal skips.
---
Quality pasta.
---
Sorry I'm only fluent in Cantha-nese.
---
It's sad that sometimes 'violence' IS the answer.
---
*hears the distant cries of casuals in the distance* 
---
Your best bet is to buy cheap exotics off the trading post and salvage them with a master/mystic salvage kit, ideally a black lion salvage kit which i would not waste on that.
---
You cannot salvage exotics bought for karma but you can mystic forge 4 of them and you can get an exotic that is salvagable. However, i do not recommend doing this as it is a huge waste of karma.
---
Maybe you will not be able to reliably fit the last F1 Sword in Berserker mode on the Discipline rotation but for most of the rest it shouldn't be too much of an issue to have more than decent DPS as long as you understand the general idea behind the rotation.
---
You have a brand new instrument toy with it though! ;)
---
I help a lot of people get back into the game. If you're on a US server, hit me up on Vayne.8563. I spend much of time in game helping new and returning players, mostly because I find it fun.
---
I wish I made bifrost instead of nevermore. The birds got really obnoxious and teh dark teal arm + blue spirit just doesn't fit me at all. I actually use to hate bifrost but now I wish I made it instead.
---
Heureka just for the sake of being a undertuned mace that isn't even useful for damage orientated builds.
---
From what I have seen in trainings on starter bosses Power Reaper is fairly accepted (and it got a little bit better with the last patch) and by the time you begin hitting harder bosses regularly you will probably have enough experience, knowledge and currency to gear other characters that may perform better.
---
Crafting speed booster would actually be a rather smart thing to add to the gem-store. 
---
It would be purely convenience but plenty of people would probably be interested in getting it. 
---
If they released a new stand alone expansion they can't make existing mounts skills mandatories.
---
Unless in said expansion there would be a mean to unlock the same mounts, which could be underwhelming for pof players.
---
Maybe new mounts could be added eventually.
---
Favourite mount: Griffon (because flying), with exalted skin. I really loved the glider mechanics, and griffon is basically a better glider. 
---
I liked the roller beetle collection, was fun to unlock it, though I'm not much into it.
---
Get Exotic armor 76-80 lvl. The way I did is armor from dungeons. You can always buy some on the TP as well. The salvage kit shouldnt mater at all. Also are you sure you want to craft them ? I got mine by doing achievements and so on. The Crafting takes a lot of gold and everything around it. 
---
From experience it is still worth using Scepter on Largos for groups of unknown skill and tanking as it will allow you to perform fairly well even if the kill is chaotic. But outside of it it's as Dak said, you're better off playing Axe.
---
How much of a DPS loss will it be?
---
In WvW, yeah. It has up to 3 endurance bars so you can jump and the restriction still applies that you cannot mount while in combat and it takes minimal hits to dismount you, which knocks you down and cc's you. So you'll never jump into a group solo as it would be suicide.
---
Where it is balanced though is that you cannot jump dismount. When you dismount you are grounded to stop you from hopping over walls and such and in PvE EVERY mount is superior to it. It's jump is garbage compared to Raptor, it's movement speed is that of the Springer and you cannot use any of it's skills except for the 1 skill, which does garbage damage compared to any other mount.
---
Haha you're still doing this? 
---
It worked ... and created many issues, thus was removed.
---
Guild Wars 2 isn't dying. Anyone who says so isn't playing MMOs long enough to comment. There are still well over 200 people working at the studio, which doesn't indicate a dying game. WoW isn't dead either.
---
FFXIV is a good game by all reports, but I played it and it didn't fit my play style. Coming to this forum to promote another game directly is just this side of rude anyway. 
---
It would likely turn as many people off to FF XIV as it would appeal to people.
---
But making up stuff about the game because you're an FF XIV fan boi doesn't make you a hero.
---
Eureka
---
I'm not completely sure but on the golem I would guess it's somewhere between 1k and 2k (but don't quote me on the exact number it's mostly a rough estimate made with napkin maths :p ).
---
Wow is dead because its at its end. There is nothing else what could be added to improve it. They are at the peak. Gw2 isnt dead and never was. Leyoffs didnt made it worst. ANet had problems with money long before these leyoffs and they will probably have problems with money even long after it. Now when they "deleted" or "stoped" any other projects, we should get even more devs working on Gw2. It should .. yes should get better then ever beffore. Only players who are spreading this "GW2 is dead" information are misleading others in beliving it so. Want to make it better for Anet ? Go and buy some Black Lion Keys for fun. Give them some of your money to show them support. Foundations to Gw2 is the community. We are the ones keeping their moral and cash up. Keep talking that Gw2 is dead and you will be the one who will bring it down for the rest of us.

Based on the quantity of monetisation fears in this thread, we'll find out in the gemstore when it gets released!
---
Where are those Quaggan icons ? &lt;3
---
Hmmm... guess I'll have to hop into another pug group to check it out!
---
Sharur. I made it because I wanted a legendary hammer and didn't like Juggernaut. To be fair, the draw effects are pretty cool and I like the footfalls and the day/night thing. But as with most hammer skins, I don't like the shape of the hammer itself :( I wish ANet could make a warhammer that did not look ridiculously oversized and just heavy and sinister, like this one (art of Robert Baratheon). https://i.pinimg.com/736x/cb/a8/77/cba87730102362259f3864d8f693d721.jpg
---
This is does nor mirrors my experience. Sure chrono is still Meta for Raids (or is it?), but since it doesn't also hand out two handful of boons every now and then, it's become way less important. It is still very welcome due to the ability to extend boons.
---
In WvW you need one or maybe two Mesmers in a zerg. If you don't bring veil or portal you can even experience being kicked from squads. If there already is a Mesmer, you risk being kicked from squad. Luckily it doesn't happen too often.
---
Can't say anything about SPvP.
---
Much of what I said above is especially true for the chrono, the Mirage is even a bit more difficult, not as valid for many Raids, and while useful in WvW foe roaming, there are other classes, that can do most if not all that Mirage brings to roaming equally well, if not better.
---
So ymmv when trying out Mesmer. 
---
Don't worry my dude "6 wings per year" is here to stay.
---
I'd rather play XI. Too much hand holding in 14 for my tastes.
---
I can live with that
---
I actually disagree that all of the utilities fit into the concept of a mesmer.
---
A mesmer is about illusions and deception, so stealth and illusions makes sense. 
---
Then it also has projectile reflection, blocks, invulnerability, extra evasion, pulls, AoE and single target CC, and portal.
---
Obviously they shouldn't just be limited to stealth and illusions, but how mesmers ironically became the best tanks in the game is an indication of how bizarre their kit is both in a design sense and a lore/concept.
---
It actually sounds like freestyle scat jazz. 
---

FF XIV has the most cringy voice acting since xenoblade 2.

But most importantly, subscribtion fees.

awesome

How rude, I hope ppl will downvote this thread.

I have nothing against ff14, but this is hardly the right place for such a thread. And spreading misinformation is still a no go btw

But, training sessions are not just to show you the mechanics, they are also there to explain you the builds and why. If you let people play whatever in training, they will keep thinking they have a great build, then go into LFG/statics, and it will crash.
---
&gt; druid used to be able to cheese one mechanic with Spirit Rez but cannot anymore

What was that ?
---
WoW isn't dead.
---
GW2 isn't dying. 
---
Didn't even mention the great community btw, this is trash tier bait and you should feel bad.
---
On a side note we need the deco limit and the local deco limit to be raised. 
---
There's plenty cool shoulder pads. Don't know why you don't like them :p
---
As other have already said, increasing the cap only delays the problem. Something I kinda would maybe like to see are MF infusions or enrichment that could be upgraded just like AR/swimming infusions, as the higher you go, the less bonuses you get per unit of luck used up in upgrading, acting as sort of balance between other players and gw2eff top 3 with 40+ mill units of luck.
---
depends on the character size ;)
---
Rodgort.
---
It's not like mesmers has received only nerfs for at least 4 or 5 patches in a row, right ?
---
How do you even get that much resources ??? Here I am satisfied with 150 refined materials in my bank...
---
Advantage of being a necro is, you never run out of free candy
---
&gt; And do we know that Kralkatorrik wiped out the army we built up for episode 5? I'm sure there were casualties, but it sounded like he merely went away at the end rather than obliterating many of our allies.
---
Well... I mean he did fire at us a big laser of crystalline doom (once mixed with all the magic he could find in his body) at the Commander. Twice. Branding everything around us (but not us, or our allies (thanks, Braham/Aurene OP shield, then plot armor!) except... well...). Considering the angle of the lasers, the forge COULD have been hit. Also, the whole area with Gorrik's Heart was behind the last laser, which was mainly our allies' camp (probably where wounded soldiers, doctors and all were during the end of the fight). So I guess it didn't go well, mostly.
---
Actually no, this reads like QoL changes, which is nice, too. Alliances are just implied at best here.  
---
[The next steps to a better communication](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/72948/future-change-to-raid-reward-delivery) are already coming in, so I hope information about alliances will be there in the near future.
---
People do that? Holy shit. That would trigger me so hard. Just… why?
---
Cringe
---
HOPE which happens to also be the only legendary I've ever made. It fits the character and looks good but I wish I had spent the gold on other skins and ascended gear instead.

Hi everyone,
---
I made a forum posting about this several weeks ago but I was recommended to do a Reddit posting as well. In short, ever since spirits were allowed to teleport Spirit of Nature no longer revives player at that are outside a 180 degrees radius. This is using the trait Nature's Vengeance, you can see the blue outline of how far Spirit of Nature should resurrect players. So, if a player is downed between a range of 180 to 360. They will not be revived. I made a video here:

This is one of the forum postings that goes more into detail:

---
I made this post to draw attention to the bug and any frustrated druids wondering why Nature Renewal is no longer working properly.
---
Assuming they don’t forbid arcdps build templates when they add their own, why would I pay more? 
---
Ignoring feasibility, this option would make wvw worse.
---
Gw2 isn't big on competition. Youd see NA players during NA times play on EU. Either  because their na server isn't doing so hot, or because they have nobody to play against. The issue is that night players have more influence on matchmaking through nightcap than the thousands of EU players.
---
Similar the other way around. If you give players the chance of choosing 2 players to play on, they'll always choose the server that is winning hardest. This only makes population and coverage balance more impossible
---
Do the same as all other night owls and wvw vets and get an alt. I play during EU prime and I need alts too because wvw is inactive more often than not.
---
Since a lot has changed recently in the support/dps department the website is currently outdated in a lot of areas. It's still a good website to get an impression of certain classes/comps, but I would treat it with caution. For example Scourge is listed as UNSUBSTANTIAL at Dhuum whereas in reality it is very close to being TOP DPS (after Condi Ren) while offering great utility for the squad (5 man Barrier/Condi Cleanse). So I suggest you don't follow this website BLINDLY.
---
And please don't use the word VIABLE. I hate when I see this. Every CLASS and SPEC is VIABLE for GW2 raids. There are no hard DPS checks in this game. You can kill all bosses with any class you want. Some classes are better than others at certain things, but it doesn't make other stuff NOT VIABLE.
---
None. I care little about the skin anyway, it's all about functionality. A cool skin on top is a bonus. That's why I crafted Astralaria and H.O.P.E. instead of their gen1 counterparts. But Eternity will forever hold a special place in my heart.
---
I really hope Mesmer gets longbow or rifle next, I fucking LOVE the HMS Divnity and Pharus.
---
...so yeah, basically the opposite of what you asked for. Sorry. I got no hate for legendaries in my heart ~~
---
Depends on what you prioritize. I wouldn't use them on your first characters if you're discovering the game. Probably better to save for the 4/5/6/7th alt, that you'll want operational faster.
---
There’s a button mini game mechanic 3 ppl do (2 others dps middle shard that becomes exposed) and you’re supposed to rotate so the stacks that build don’t kill you. The spirit res would be timed to allow the same ppl to remain on their buttons for the time needed to dps down the middle shard.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Berserker%27s_Lightward%27s_Battlehammer
---
Sadly, there is yet no class with realistic battlehammer animations. They're all anime styles that shake the earth and whatnot, so the gigantic weapons at least fit the theme. But we DO have one realistic skin!
---
I sort of cheated with that one. I sold 2 legendaries, bought Eternity, and still had like 1k gold left over. You get all the previous greatsword skins from binding Eternity too.
---
It’s not a legendary but check out the mistforged obsidian hammer (from PvP/wvw). 
---
Also as a cool trick all the mistforged weapons “glow” the color of your team in PvP/wvw (red for red team, blue for blue and yes they even do green for wvw matching) and they aren’t crazy oversized either.
---
OH and it’s an ascended weapon version so you still have your extra 3% dmg and whatever stuff to evenly match a legendary (stats wise).
---
(Sadly) I agree... Hammers didn’t get much love in gw2 
---
The boost lets you temporarily raise a character to 80 and gives you exotic gear to test out in the silverwaste. Gives you a good demo of the class in a pve area.
---
If you don't like the class, you can undo the boost and try it on another class until you find one you like.
---
The pain is real. Fu****g Mystic Curio/Shards of the crown
---
Like most swords in this game, bolt would look better if it was slightly smaller. Looks so stupid that it is basically touching the ground.
---
Bifrost, made it a month before Nevermore was announced
---
Wgatsit do?
---
They aren't. You get access to condi cleanse in X/water via water 4 and 5, while base air skills are close to useless other than just DPSing with Air autoattacks, close gap/interrupt with Air 2, while air/water dual element sword skill is just bad after last change not allowing you to cast it backwards while kiting. Meaning that going from water to air usually allows you to only condi cleanse.  
---
Especially if you're using water/arcane/weaver variant that gives you Swiftness from Arcane when attuning to Air, that grants you Regeneration from Woven Stride in Weaver traitline, that cleanses condition from you from Cleansing Water, a Water trait. Elementalist is full of those small synergies.
---
What about Air-&gt;Water as escape? Well, it let's you CC/evade with Air 5 (Updraft), then evade further with Water 2 (Riptide), then you can drop target, look behind and usu Air 4 (Ride The Lightning), to create huge distance between you and your enemy. It's the strongest combo of attunements when you just want to disengage the fight.
---
Oh, didn't know that. But I can still use the other one on a lvl80, or is that not worth it?
---
When switching from air to water you open Dagger 4 in air which is a big escape. 
---
What language do the Black Widow and the Mysterious Voice speak in, inside of Deepstone fractal? 
---
Sword weaver doesnt use elements of rage jn pvp. Its only really worth double attuning to air or fire if you need to push dps.
---
I run a Sc-Sw / Sw-To build on my Mesmer in conquest. I’ve got The Shining Blade as my main hand sword (with Touch of Madness), and am debating making Bolt for my Scepter off-hand sword. Running Meteorilogicus for scepter, and think Bolt would complement it. 
---
My bad, did not see the PVP restriction.
---
Howler, it’s cool and all but after I made it I discovered I prefer big flashy things.  I’d say flame seeker prophecy but I just think shields look cool in general
---
It would be neat if they let you sit on it... and if it's strong enough to support a person's weight.
---
meteorlogicus. it was the first one i ever started and it took a long time to make, when i started i had 2 toons (scourge and dragonhunter) that were flavour of the month who used the scepter. by the time i completed it neither of my toons use the scepter as a main weapon and i also found it bulky and doesnt fit their now used elites or fashionwars aesthetics.
---
Why wouldn't you save all that silk for the festival of four winds?!
---
Yeah, T3 is clownfiesta. It will be better in T4
---
It used to be super cool because it had moving eels at daytime and petrified, luminescent eels at night time - until they fixed the bug that caused the night time look. Now it’s really boring, doesn’t have a very visible aura (it might be the same as the mariners breathers even) and in addition to barely seeing it anyways because underwater it just made me regret getting it after the “bug fix”.
---
Know the encounters where people will stack on the boss. Make sure to get tides of time on the dps classes. T4 people will be more stacked and know what to do but will still be hard to do in pugs. Make sure you reach 85% on boon with foods and 15% will come from large mobility potions which will cap you to 100%. 85% is good for beginner chrono in raids too. 
---
Fractals since you are the only chrono having %100 BD is important to maintain boons as you are the only source of quickness and alacrity.
---
Why the downvote? Plain truth.
---
They do and it does.
---
Exactly! At least give us some of your nutritious green spheres. 
---
I hope they dial their integration back. Significantly tarnished the whole GW2 experience in my opinion. That said, it is the best mount system in the genre, but gw2 wasn't built with them in mind. It used to be a comit to go out and finish off a zone and do all the JPs. Now its trivial and tedious 
---
just grab matthias' staff or dhuum's scythe, they're both better than bifrost
---
I'm cool with it so long as it ONLY supports the magi tech anesthetic as the current weapon models and exo suit outfits and mounts do. Beyond that it wouldn't fit well. 
---
Thank you :D

There is already a bugs section forum post as well:

---
It was posted first, also an in-game report was made too.  I added the bug report section to the original post now.  Thank you.
---
Not a fan of Matthias' staff, the texture feels a bit low res and plain, there are plenty of better looking staves. Dhuum's scythe looks great though, it has more character than the two legendary staves.
---
Dragonhunter uses sceptre, so does firebrand and condi scourge does as well
---
ah, no, matthias' staff gimmick is that it has a red aftertrail on the glowy red part at the top of the staff. otherwise you're right it's largely unremarkable on its own, but the VFX make it great
---
Both my hammer (Sharur) and my shield (The Flameseeker Prophecies), not enough use for them, I barely ever equip them =D
---
you could just not die in the first place..
---
And that's why you don't raid with plebs that die on KC.
---
And Mirage
---
I have only one legendary weapon, Nevermore, and I love it. On the other hand...
---
Aurora. I know it is not a weapon, and I am only 1 step away from completing the first collection, but it is such a slow grind to get to the 315k karma for that god backpack! I am now beginning to doubt my 'stick-to-it-ive-ness' through the whole process. I haven't looked over the requirements for the second and subsequent steps, but I cannot imagine those being any less of a time sink. It has become such a focal point in my play time that I have not even begun the 'All or Nothing' story chapter yet.
---
I hope it is worth the time, should I stay with the collection to the end.
---
Thing is, certain classes make certain bosses much easier and smoother. Taking proper classes for ca allows for fast burst. Same goes for kc. Also, have fun doing largos with only non mirages in a pug. Thats going to be a mess
---
Reminds me of the icons used in the monster hunter games.
---
They look so cool
---
Crafting should probably take some time. Or have a speed option but make the slow way have some minigame for better results.
---
&gt;Decide i really have to get one weapon put aside everything else i am doing in game and focus on finishing the wep.
---
I am totally with you on that - Aurora has become all-consuming for me at this point, and I am not even done with the first collection yet \*sigh\*
---
Thanks for the gr8 answer &lt;3
---
I don't know if they will play an important role but it's going to be tricky adding more and more mounts to the game.
---
A good example for that is the Roller Beetle in my opinion. I think that Roller Beetle is probably the most innovative/unique mount in all MMORPG games. But on the other side, it is also probably the mount that took the most time/effort to develop. And compare its impact on the gameplay vs. its development costs/develop time? I think there is a problem.
---
If they are going to add new mounts they really need to be smart about how they are going to do it. The mounts must be designed in such a way that they would be useful in a lot of scenarios. Warclaw was a good idea since it probably didn't take them a long time to develop and it has no competition in WvW (there are no other mounts). So it has high impact in this gamemode and overall. New mounts should be designed in a similar way to this. They should somehow be usable in a lot of scenarios. Roller beetle has the ability to destroy certain walls for example, but this can only be achieved in ONE map since all the other maps were not designed with Roller Beetle in their mind. And it doesn't make sense to go ahead and modify all other maps just because of the introduction of a new mount.
---
Oh ok. Thanks. I just got the game so I'm only 65. I'll definitely join in next time
---
I thought this would be a joke about "support chronomancer", telling me that chronomancers don't deserve my support.
---
Just overload and heat sync can share 20 stacks that last very long, with no blasting involved. Moving fields generally have bigger priority than static ones because you can start casting them outside of other fields.
---
Runes of pack/aristocracy can help even more with might. Pack runes, dagger 2 in air or air spec will take care of perma fury.
---
It falls behind rene already because it cant provide alacrity nor high CC, but healing is never an issue since you have quite strong passive healing from mist as well as 10 man shouts. With fire spec you can even share aura twice from doing fire rotation.
---
I like ur ideas, but that is to much off all to much Boon Output too much dmg+% for Allies. Even more dmg+ then a Druid. 
---
[Made a video for you](https://streamable.com/lhdw8). Barrage is 360 radius. Barrage circle touches the corpse. Spirit of Nature command skill is 360 radius. I use command skill from 360 radius. I rezz npc.  
---
The only bug is you not rading tooltips properly :)
---
Bolt and HOPE.
---
I hate it when weapons are stupidly oversized... When you're constantly excreting particles all over the place the item skin gets lost in the chaos anyway IMO.  
---
I also play norn females almost exclusively, so their weapons (and back items which are counted as weapons by the system apparently)  end up mostly being sized for norn males who are literally 3x larger at the minimum and that gets on my nerves.  Same is true when I get on one of my men and the weapon shows up comically small but at least that isn't an issue for legendary weapons.
---
&gt; The ability to read 
---
Damn. I guess I can't join.
---
Then I guess a better solution is to have a clearly visible aoe circle on Nature Renewal's activation.  Thereby allowing the player to clearly see the radius of Nature Renewal's skill during the heat of  combat.
---
I can't find the magic trail you use on the roller beetle, for some reason. I can find the Griffon one.
---
Which direction is it from Dragon's Claw?
---
Okay, and what is this 5th element in the center that you have to attune to? (I guess it is called Leeloo, or multipass). If not, your arrows in the middle need to be longer.
---
Renegade easily does permanent alacrity with some diviner's gear and just F4 on cooldown :) There's a reason FB+Ren (dubbed firebrigade which i find super funny) is considered very good atm, it provides all the needed buffs with less of a dps loss than chrono (which also needs a druid along with it to upkeep might)
---
I run firebrigade whenever I can in fractals and it works amazingly, I recommend giving it a try ;) 
---
They had a griffon at pax east last year.
---
You gehlt dawn and twilight as well? Damn, thats what i would do if i hadnt already crafted dawn
---
I can also see people whining about how they "paid for this skin, so I want it all the time!"
---
Nice anecdote.
---
Mace is used by only three classes, but all of them have a pve build that uses a mace.
---
This! This would be the real deal!
---
Just blame the healers for not cleansing the confusion when you jumped into the hitbox during pizza attack. 
---
It helps me appreciate things for what they truly are, regardless of corporate banter and political propaganda, instead of jumping around like an easily-entertained, easily-swayed overgrown monkey in rose-tinted glasses.
---
As for the jackal statue; I actually appreciate that the multiple artists had an opportunity to get paid for creating this impressive piece, instead of another portrait of someone's drooly child or whatever. As a figure enthusiast, I personally think it's one of the *better* ways of marketing - something that makes a virtual world both substantial and unique in the eyes of both potential and current customers. It's exciting to see our fantasies turned real - yet it's still worth to remember that it's part of someone's *business*, and there are more cold, commercial reasons to why this was created; thus the reaction to OP's title.
---
There are, though, still things that can and should make people feel happier about the world - and among those are things both as small as someone's free comics, or as large and mind-blowing as Critical Role's 8 million dollars animation kick-starter. Yeah: *that* is impressive.
---
I don't like indulging this sentiment, because I think we lost way more people who had no say in communication. Also, a lot of the people who made the poor decisions to spread the company too thin/lie to the playerbase are still employed.
---
Ooh i really like your fashion gurl/boi
---
Gratz on legendary, suits you
---
I don't really regret it, but I got Rodgort's Flame as a pre drop and, after making it, I've ended up just putting it in my bank for now. I want to take advantage of the stat-swapping and the only place I could really use that would be on my Firebrand or Scourge as they swap from PvE to WvW but I don't touch my Firebrand enough and I feel like I can't get too into the Scourge WvW playstyle.
---
The price now changed a bit based on the changes in loot. The best farm for leather are probably still Lake Doric leather farm. Gossamer drops everywhere and even I have a stack in my bank for nothing. Would send you some but Im keeping it for guild upgrade.   
---
There are 2 ways you can go . Farm gold to buy crafting materials or farm crafting materials wich you can sell for gold so you will be able to get the one you need. Also you dont really need any materials for ascended weapons and armor you get from achievements. With those you can skip Exotic and go for ascended immediately. 
---
There are some achievements where you can get an "Armor piece". I always choosed chest or leggings. Those are probably the hardest to get. Weapons can be easily obtained from specialization achievements. Even if you would need to make a new character , level it up to lvl 80 and then doing those achievements. Rings , Accessories and back item can be easily obtained by farming "tokens" in living story maps. Blood Rubies , Winterberries , Jade Shards and so on. 
---
After you will get a full ascended set, you should go into Fotm and farm it every day. I crafted my first set a long time ago when there wasnt even Bloodstone Fen. After that I farmed T4 daily and then got full set for all my classes. 
---
[Bulardi decided to make his own version](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/544908960608550962/563329708457066508/kc.png)
---
That's hard though
---
I'm bad at being good though
---
All necro mains (outside WvW) are well acquainted with suffering. 
---
For real? Did it mention the wizards tower?
---
I'm pretty sure rewards are sent via mail. The same applies to your birthday presents. You can be afk for years and comeback and get all your rewards sitting in your mails
---
thanks dude, im thinking of which legendary to craft
---
thank you very much :D
---
Yes
---
Thanks!
---
...No? Where have I stated that? I was just telling the person above that others may not care about aquatic weapons as much as they do. I personally don’t care if someone doesn’t like my legendary, aquatic or not, I use whatever fits my character. 
---
A heal necro is not only there to heal your ass.
---
Yeah, I recently realized this, thank you. I feel Nature Renewal should have its own aoe radius that can be clearly seen by the player.  I don't feel the player should have to guess whether Nature Renewal is in revivable  range or not.  I've updated my original post.
---
What pve guard build uses mace? 
---
So how many tickets until they give group leaders a confirmation option before merging with other groups? Drives me mad when people randomly merge and ruin group organisation. 
---
Uh? It's been a while, really. The Staff Weaver that came with Path of Fire quickly turned out broken. It could deal some serious damage, especially in PVE - but also required a whole lot of attunement and cooldown juggling. 
---
They tried to bring it down a bit. A bit more and then just dropped a hammer on it. It went from recommended to do not bring lightning fast. 
---
It is best to not assume gender in the era of peoplekind
---
There's about as much in the "a net is ruining the game/wvw/PvP and here's why..." posts. 
---
Both sides of the same coin.
---
No clue but I hope they one day will update Mystic Forge . Making 250 lodestones for your legendary weapon from cores, thats more then 1250 clicks. Or even having Jeweler to craft these lodestones. Or they could finaly use those globs of dark energi wich I have over 1 000 in my bank. But we shall see. 
---
Also I hope we will be able to get enchantments as well. If Jeweler will get updates to 500 lvl we could have the ability to craft these +20% Magic Found and so on.
---
can't ppl just make these posts on /r/GuildWarsDyeJob instead of littering main sub?
---
like wow, congrats, you made the cheap legendary everyone has.
---
Yeah, i do have a character, which i bought unbreakable tools for, exactly for this purpose. To farm materials and i usually do my dailies.. but as i said, i haven't played for.. almost two years for real. So settling back into it will take a bit of time.
---
I didnt ment it this way of assuming gender 
---
just dont drool all over yourself while looking at that pic =P 
---
This is where our money from buying the mount skins went... to a mount statue... :thinking:
---
Healbrand, probably. 
---
Lodestones are already an ingredient in crafting some of the core legendaries, so it is certainly possible. We’ll have to wait and see.
---
If you want leather then Doric is probably the best. You can always buy those for magic but you will get more T5 insted of T6 wich you are after. If Im using my magic then I will buy trophy shippment or wood for elder wood. Also you can go into Orr. Undead enemies will drop bags from wich you can also get a lot of T6 leather, but its lower chance because you can get diferent materials from it as well. 
---
Ascended equipment depends on what stats you want. If core or Hot stats then living story maps wich were added till PoF. PoF doesnt have much of ascended items you can get sadly. Or are harder .. really harder to get. Keep your laurels for achievements and items you are not able to get from any other meens. Good example would be enrichments ? Enhanctments ? Or how its called. Cant really remmember right now. Upgrades wich you can put into your ascended amulet. 
---
If you have other questions let us know ;) 
---
They won't increase as much as broccoli and cauliflower will.
---
Semi-related, but I still think they should just make all the unlocks account-wide. Why should I spend baubles for all those items again when I've already obtained them on another character...
---
Fabulous Daredevil?
---
Bolt, just because I crafted it right before Shining Blade got released
---
The idea isn't really increasing the cap just for the sake pf increasing it, but slowly reducing the need of non-gemstore bonus luck, freeing players to stack other effects. 
---
That's what the cap would be shared with those boosts. So the lower you are under the 'final' cap, the more you benefit from non-gemstore luck boosts like a banner or food. But as your account luck gets closer to that final cap, you no longer need to stack as much MF. You can put a different enrichment in your amulet, get different foods, get a different guild boost, etc, allowing you to stack a different reward like karma or gold.  
---
MF that can be obtained from gemstore has to still work, for monetization reasons, so that'll be exempt and stil lgo past the 'final' cap.
---
I use Nevermore on my necro, what are you using instead? 
---
Sharur, not because of the usual reasons, I still like its look. But I dropped the Colossus while I had just finished Vizier's Folly, so I did Juggernaut and I haven't found the will to complete Sharur since then.
---
Oh kudzu is my favourite (although I've not made any leggys yet) but I don't like longbow at all. 
---
[An unknown language of the Six.](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Language#Ephemeral_Spirit) Theoretically, it could be the original human homeworld's language.
---
Sorry total noob here but how to you get Ascended without crafting?
---
I've browsed metabattle a fair bit, but I find it hard to tell from guides the proverbial "ease" of a role when played in context.
---
noooooo
---
check MightyTeapot build on youtube. Also Metabattle or SnowCrows.
---
Thanks ! Now we just have to ... wait :D
---
It has been an issue for a long time but recently there was a thread about it which most likley prompted them to act. (something somthing camel and straw) Seems Anet are improving themselves
---
There's a ramp that branches off the main path that runs through the zone. It's near the Dragon's Claw point of interest to the east.
---
It'll take you all the way down to the dredge town. It's optional though since without the rewinder it takes a while to go back up to Sorrow's Cave. Before I realized to use that trick, I took 3 characters through the springer, griffon and skimmer paths until I hit the volatile magic cap since those three paths are so close to each other when going through them.
---
Yeah, that's why I pointed out Snowcrows. Most of their guides have some line talking about whether a build is easy/hard for new players to pick up and play.
---
I feel sorry for sad little people like that.
---
Thank you, I updated the post with the correct numbers. I was tired when I made this posting. 
---
METEOLOGICUIS, i could use that 20 mins on something productive.
---
Yeah. Same for promoting materials.
---
Not only bulk crafting should be actually in bulk, all materials at once, the Mystic forge should also get a recipe panel for all the recipes with specific fixed matetials (promotion, clovers, mystic kit, etc) and also allow actual bulk crafting.
---
Hell, even if I had to pay extra, like spirit shards, coin or karma, I'd prefer to get it done in one go.
---
As i said yesterday to a guildy: "i really we don't finish Kralkatorrik now in the last season episode". 
---
After this twist. After the Aurene's death... And maybe her alive again for "insert-good-reasons-here". 
---
In my opinion it would be better to wait a bit more before the giant dragon death. The commander can not escape this huge failure with no pain. And he can not go back to the battle right now just like nothing happened. Killing Kralkatorrik would be weird.
---
I want Season 5 to open with the commander having given up at the end of Season 4, and just relaxing on the beach without a care in the world. Suddenly, the beach is attacked by minions of the great sea dragon, and your mission objective is to stay reclined on your beach chair and not give a shit.
---
If they monetize build templates and shut down arc I'm done with the game. Simple as that. Don't wanna pay for something that should pretty much be standard in a game like that. And I certainly don't wanna respec between condi and power between every few bosses.
---
Amazing game! You won't regret it
---
Guess more festivals are needed
---
I also hate the size, it's too small. The npc in fractals has a huge one, that's what I thought it was gonna look like. Lame..
---
SAB is old school. Just the way you're used to have items in old school games. Fair enough. Boring and annoying, but fair enough.
---
I'm already loving it!  There's so many things I want to do, so many classes I want to level, I'll be busy for a longggg time.
---
Its heart, and then you summon Captain Tyria whom may cause an auto win.
---
but scourge is listed one tier higher (mediocre) on dhuum? also builds/benchmarks/raid viability have been updated since last patch afaik.
---
Chuka and Champawat because I was just looking for some decent looking precursors to make. Then Pharus came out and Exitus, Doctrina, and Spero all look super great. 
---
I think creating a legendary takes SO much time, that at some point if you realized you didn’t like it.. you’d just stop making it. Unless you pay to win with a credit card and buy a legendary straight off the TP, then I don’t think really anyone spends months working on an item, just to not like it in the end. I made the weapon BECAUSE I liked it. 
---
Dragon after a Dragon. We should have a normal enemy again. Some race or a dictator. A cult trying to kill us. If you will be still going up and up trying to make next enemy more dangerous, one day you will hit the top . From there it would be dificult to drop back down. We should have Season 5 looking back and getting in touch with groups we came to know in the past. White Mantle, Balth had his own army of followers, Consortium, Pact, Vigils, Whispers and Priory, Zephyrs and back to Sylvari look on The Avatar of The Pale Tree. 
---
i just wana game to survive this shit, i dont care about 3543584 dragon we gona kill.

The soft trinity system doesn't apply for end game PvE content because of the need for particular damage types on certain bosses and the reliance on boons to reach sufficient damage output.
---
That is fine, in theory, and a harder amalgam of Quickness + Alacrity/Might + Fury + Healing / specific dps types would be fine if we had sufficient flexible options for those support roles (we don't), didn't have powerful unique boons (we do) and didn't have encounters built around particular class combinations or utility.
---
Maybe one day we'll get to a somewhat softer situation where we've got reasonable variation for roles outside of power dps but we aren't really there yet which is a shame after two rounds of elite specs and 3 and a half years of raids and fractals in their current incarnation. 
---
&gt;	OP asked for perfect trio, so I don’t see any reason to bring a reaper.
---
I can follow your logic, I guess I just take a more nuanced view on it...that being that maybe what's perfect for 3 casual brothers still developing their skills and strengths in the game might be slightly different than what's perfect for top tier speed clear teams.
---
For these guys, I'm thinking that what's perfect might be a lot closer to having a team that trades "squeezing every last possible drop of DPS out of three characters" for some survivability, self-sufficiency, some forgiveness in the rotations, and less demanding skill floors, positioning, and stats.
---
I'm not at all saying you're *wrong*. It's objectively true that there are options that give more DPS than reaper. 
---
I guess I'm just of the opinion that, in this case, "not optimal" doesn't necessarily mean "not perfect for the situation". These guys aren't perfect players, so a perfect comp isn't really necessary, and maybe not really a benefit, if that comp carries significant penalties for imperfect execution.
---
condi rev.
---
THat's it tho
---
But then he would need to play LW2 before buying HoT. Then LW3 -&gt; PoF -&gt; LW4.
---
Though, we don't want to kill Kralkatorrik, not without a replacement or substitute "conduit". The whole point was to integrate Aurene as this replacement so that the whole cycle doesn't even happen in the first place. 
---
With Primordus and Jormag this is a bit of a tricky topic. We know that the Elder Dragons wake up when the magic of the world is high and therefore their own magic that they accumulated and emitted is low. Balthazar, however, used the magic of Primordus and Jormag to "power-up" so their own magic would be lower than before (probably not much but lower nonetheless). That would mean that the only explanation for Primordus and Jormag being asleep is to recover from the effect of the machine and the clash of opposing magic. So, they could wake up again at any time as long as they recovered.
---
I think, the question is rather in what format we deal with an elder dragon, as in delivering it as content. So far, we killed Zhaitan in the personal story and killed Mordremoth in an Expansion and we only fought Kralkatorrik in an Episode. We also know that there is no expansion coming in the near future.
---
This tells me, either that we find a way to bring Aurene back in S04E06 and power her up enough in Season 5 and it ends with us fighting again, and winning, against Kralkatorrik or we find another way to deal with him if Aurene is truly gone.
---
The problem with the Deep Sea Dragon is that it is the least known dragon. We know nothing really about him so it would be strange to pick a fight with someone we know nothing about while we have two we know better right in our front-yard. 
---
Yes plz.
---
Krack had an expansion and a half dedicated to him... Getting tired.
---
I think we will get another reveal that completely changes how we should proceed to safeguard Tyria that completely displaces the threat of the dragons or changes its nature.
---
Collections are with the achievements, you can do collections for a precursor weapon to make a legendary for example
---
Support is really underestimated in GW2.  Being able to slot in a powerful utility skill and drastically change the battlefield is an incredibly underrated part of the game.  The game doesn't teach this very well, but once you figure out the right strategy using the right variation of class tools, traits and utilities there's very little that you won't be able to do with a little practice. 
---
Go to the bank, there's five other people using this skin.
---
The problem with Howler is that if the skill doesn’t shoot a projectile then you don’t see the wolf, which is retarded. For example, Tempests only see the wolf on Air4. 
---
But the warhorn looks really good at night
---
charr master race!
---
Game basically vomits gear at you at end game stuff. Half of the time I do t4 fractals I get some piece of ascended gear, you can drop ascended chests from raids, you can get ascended from pvp and wvw as well
---
The skins that is 
---
Cool thanks!
---
Seriously, it’s like every single day. Why do we allow these threads?
---
I can't make it work for some reason. 
---
It works on google or on word (it types a space and v so basically what the macro is suposed to do) but I can't make it work in game.
---
Tried it on discord too and it doesn't work either, instead of typing a space and v so " v" it just types z ...
---
Can someone explain/help with this problem ?
---
Thank you
---
125 points to master

You get a decent chunk of XP for completing a map, plus some loot.  If you're over 80% done with a map it might be worth finishing it up.
---
Don't force it, though.  The best way to play is just following your sense of adventure - it sounds like you're doing it right so far!
---
I've been asking for this to be split for many years with them still doing nothing. Yes you can drag and drop to organize and group, but it's not the same thing as what individual controls can do for you.
---
Sadly, it feels like they don't care much about guilds at all. For example, when did we last get a new guild mission? It's been years, surely.

Just a nice little storyline about the "basic" enemies like Centaurs, Inquest, Sons of Svanir, ...

---
I'll gladly throw down $40 on this expansion
---
Now do it 8 more times for each class. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
&gt; if you ask me.
---
we won't.
---
Oh boy. I would love to see some beautiful endgame maps without all destructed. Some evil bandits and some queenstaleish landscape. I know every map has a bit of it but I really love starter maps in very game much more than what you always get in endgame.
---
The more important question is...will the legendary runes and sigils come with their own special effects, when they do get released sometime in the distant future.
---
What is this? A meme for ants?
---
&gt;i have to get around 500 hero points post-leveling, most of which require these masteries
---
Can be done in WvW.No mastery requirements.
---
You won't "level from 1 to 80" in expansion content again. There are XP bars, but they'll fill faster, especially with events and meta-events.
---
As for the mount masteries, the mounts themselves are usable without masteries by default, but the masteries will unlock more "skills" for them (jump farther, higher, refill endurance....). If you just a need a way to speed up your trips, the first basic mount will be enough.
---
As for the difficulty and story, most players tend to agree that the core game is indeed poorer and easier than the late game. The story becomes more interessant in expansion content/living world, and the ennemies aren't made of cardboard anymore.
---
Also happens based on your camera collision settings and if there was a floor/object in front of their character.  A large number of factors could cause this pic.
---
Tbh I'd like to try it too. But I have a close friend playing with me and he mains engi so I got that side covered
---
Don't really need a guide, just pick an area to start and don't leave it until you get 100%.  If you get stumped and can't locate a particular missing location then you can google it but most are pretty easy to get to. I did map complete pre-HOT / PoF. I imagine it is WAY easier with gliding and mounts.
---
You won’t like this game... I feel the story gets better but yes, you need to level in the expansion areas to unlock masteries for those expansion stuff. It’s stupid IMO but that’s how it is, it’s the same thing you’re doing just in different areas, I hate it also, I mainly play for the world vs world, other stuff I do when I’m bored. 
---
I'll ask Raymond about the feasibility today. However, even if feasible, it's probably not something we'd get to for quite some time. We have a lot on our plate already.
---
Ray and I have talked about several things we think could be done to improve the experience of queuing into WvW, but so far they haven't made it to the top of the priority list with everything else we'd like to get done.

Legendary armors: now i have this skin for a while, it's more like a living kp than a real skin
---
Some only feel anything when shitting on others. Regardless of age, demographic, or belief.
---
No. There was talk about it before we launched the Warclaw, but it was something we decided not to do. There was a team member who mentioned that to a player and that made it around. But he was mistaken. 
---
As I don't care about the skins, I am fine with all of them.
---
I would regret getting any gen2 legendary but I wanted the skin from Astralaria. I like space.
---
Your character is so beautiful! That whole outfit goes so well together. Congrats on the backpiece :)
---
Thanks
---
Post it on /r/MMORPG 
---
Awesome, thank you.
---
If you like to go ham with blasting fields, engi and ele are classes with biggest amount of blasts and have big variety of combo fields. Very good for aoe might and stealth.
---
Your options in gw2 are limitless, especially in non competitive environment because it's not about how effective you can do something, it's about how fun you find doing it. Aka do you want to press 1 button and get boons/high burst or do you want to combo skills for that bigger effect..?
---
[Here is what happened to experienced veteran players at release of HoT.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQvSbjjFvCY)
---
The story becomes better and better the closer you get to the present, and the difficulty will ... well, it'll become much less boring.
---
I get why people want to correct the "no Trinity" claims, but honestly most players never get into raids or high-tier fractals and if that's the case then there is effectively no trinity, and you really can play as advertised.
---
best answer in there
---
true, fe they put the disclaimer 
---
"Important - This build might change soon. There is a lot changing for this build due to the weird combinations of classes that it can play alongside. Gear and rotations will be updated as soon as possible."
---
on the chronomancer build page.
---
 
---
note to the op, if you want recent info on builds etc., the snow crows discord (class channels etc.) is really active (look for pinned posts) and they are happy to answer your questions. :)

I've only ever crafted the Predator and I haven't regretted it yet.  I'm about half way finished with The Binding of Ipos, so I'll get back to you on whether or not I regret that one.
---
As u/Kupper mentioned you'll get your HPs faster in the expansions and the PvE gets harder especially in HoT.
---
If you already own the expansions:
---
- you can try out elite specs in the pvp area (crossed swords at the top - &gt; join lobby; then setup your pvp build by clicking the helmet symbol you can now see at the top center)
---
- you can get the first mount (raptor) after boosting an other character to 80 and finishing the first story part of PoF. You can ask your friend/anyone to do the mission for you and only accept the reward in the end if you don't want to be spoiled story wise ;) it's true that you will need exp from PoF for the mounts BUT ONLY to improve them/get to the point you can unlock additional ones. The "standard" raptor is good as it is for basic movement improvement.
---
General advise: "grinding" your way up isn't fun no matter where or how. If recommend simply doing what's fun for you and getting the exp along the way! You don't like map completion? You don't feel challenged enough? Go to xpac zones right away and try soloing HPs (HoT ones) or other champions. Or do some pvp/WvW get a bit out of PvE for a while and boost your last few levels with tomes of knowledge (you get a lot of those in pvp/WvW), you can even get hero points for WvW currencies . This game got so much to give, but if you are focusing an the things you hate, because they seem to be the fastest way to the "real game" you can easily miss out the things you would actually like ;) 
---
I made the Bifrost for my Elementalist since I ran both Staff Auramancer and DPS Weaver.
---
Then Meteor Shower got nerfed literally days later, Sword got buffed, Sc/WH Tempest got buffed, and now Staff Ele isn't really a good pick for any build. Other weapons aren't much fun for me on the class, and the Staff just kinda underperforms.
---
You get a free lvl 80 booster when buying an expansion so you can skip story and leveling and go directly to the more challenging expansion content, though PoF is only slighlty more difficult than the core game. You can get the ratpor during the very first mission of PoF and then go to HoT jungle. This is where many players struggle.
---
Finished my Griffin, just finished crafting "the device" woof. Got a long road ahead!
---
Once you've hit level 80, it will also become way more common to receive tomes of knowledge that you can use to level your alts much-much-much quicker. If you want a challenge, try to get to Tier 4 of Fractals of the Mists or participate in raids. There are lots of posts about these already, so give that a search.
---
End-game mobs in HoT and PoF, along with the Living World stories, aren't the push-overs that you've come to hate in Core. You'll have to engage a lot more thoughtfully and learn the mechanics of many of the different veterans and elites. Of course it's also a social game, so the more friends you play with, the more fun it'll be.
---
Right now the Super Adventure Box festival is running. Try to play the Tribulation mode. Also not a walk in the park. Good luck!
---
Yeah, true.
---
There's an easier path that avoids this in normal and infantile mode.
---
You should watch Lenore: The Cute Little Dead Girl. Same kind of illusion
---
Frostfang and bifrost. Former feels too lackluster to be a legendary and bifrost only fits on a guard. Bird stick looks way better.
---
Time for Golems, Tanks and Watchworks enter mass production!
---
So, you want a rushed ending...
---
We wounded and weakened last episode, we kill next episode. Not really rushed is it
---
Moderately damaging a single eye and losing everything and your only hope of winning is not what I'd consider a huge step to winning in a single small LS episode.
---
I think the main reason it's not being recommended here is because your Ring of Fire is put in a weird spot since Riptide doesn't do much for you. If you go F/x to W/F, just don't blow Ring of Fire right away for damage and see if you can use it just before attuning back into Air/Fire so you can use Polaric Leap or Flame Uprising to give yourself an aura and/or Flame Grab after burning is applied while attuning to Earth to blast it.
---
I feel you, criticism is a magnet for downvotes here and then they go around bragging about being the best community ever..
---
We did more than just damage an eye
---
Tempest ele can use it too.

Subreddit: Downvote downvote downvote downvote
---
Anyone would think this was r/2meirl4meirl
---
But what about my infusion? 
---
Endgame is where things get interesting..
---
As you reach level 80, 2 elite specialization will complement provide you with 2 completely new ways to play your class, opening tons of possibilities and skills.
---
In order to level one of these specialization you will need 250 hero points. Throughout tyria each hero encounters rewards you with 1 hero points but on the expansion maps any hero encounter will reward you with 10 points so you essentially need 25 of these encounters. None of them are easy peasy, and you'll need a group to do them.
---
But where the true challenge lies, at least in PVE, is in fractals and raids. You will need to master your class, it's rotation and abilities, you will need to understand the mechanics of the fights.. A lot of people just give up because it's hard.
---
Finally, the story is as you said extremely bad from 1-80.
---
But Living story is awesome.. these are new chapters, maps and a new story released every few months. The last living story chapter made me cry.
---
You'll find the community super helpful if you decide to stick around.
---
It sounds like you took the more difficult route
---
frankly, it sounds like your friend is giving you some rather incomplete information. you can get different kinds of stackable XP bonuses at every corner, you get the first mount by playing a single mission in PoF, and enemies in expansion content are a lot less forgiving, and HPs accumulate rather quick.
---
other people already went into more detail, so i'll spare you a repeat, however i would suggest to either ask your friend to elaborate more, or simply ask other people you play with. a verbal conversation tends to clear up such matter with far less effort.
---
They did thats why I didn't next episode
---
Still losing to that asura with chak egg sac.
---
Sudoku intensifies.
---
Check out the "Specialisation Collection" under the Collection achievement panel. Every class has two collections, since HoT and PoF both introduced new weapons available to the class. They take some time and grind (especially the HoT weapons) but are a cheaper alternative to crafting ascended weapons.
---
As for Warrior, the Spellbreaker specialisation uses Berserker (zoija) stats, the Berserker specification is typically played with Viper (expensive) or Rabid (cheap alternative) :) 
---
hi Bulardi.
---
What you did  was the game as a whole. If you did not enjoy it, chances are the 5% of challenging content will not be able to keep your tummy full. It was good that you gave it an honest try though.
---
Not really, only warr has competitive f2p wvw build and that's for roaming, other classes favor expansion builds a lot more.
---
Metabattle has some decent builds for various content.
---
cool af

Guild Wars 2's plot is about the dragons, it's not like Guild Wars. Once all the dragons are dead the plot is over.
---
Is there controversy over this? 
---
&gt; just like the commander becoming chosen out of nowhere
---
What? How do you even reason this? Sure, no one outright declared it until Livia did, but do you really think that the Commander would have made it this far if they *weren't* Chosen?
---
The player character is able to not only master a given profession of magic, but find alternate routes of its usage through elite specializations. We have killed Elder Dragons and all manner of horrific creatures in the world. How could the notion of us being Chosen *come out of nowhere?* The GW1 hero was Chosen, and they hadn't done anything exceptionally impressive at that stage. And there were plenty of Krytans who were also labeled as Chosen by the Eye of Janthir that were just normal villagers.
---
Being Chosen isn't some legendary prophecy put on a person's shoulders. It's just a name for those who possess a particular quality-- "high magical aptitude."
---
Some of the Hero Challenges are semi-hard, sure, but most of them are as easy as the ones from the core game.
---
This. Also Air 2 and air auto chain 2 cleanse condis through swiftness/superspeed because of the Weaver+Water traits, so in addition to water 5, Air/Water combo theoretically has the most cleanse of the combos.
---
We apologize for the fault in the *mentioned reduced border capacity*. Those responsible have been sacked.
---
Is it a sunrise? The sun kinda looks how I feel every morning...
---
and not taking dmg?
---
I agree with you, I'd like to see more attribute combinations (in general, but also specifically available to the PvE/WvW crowds).
---
I've wanted to see more PvP combinations become available in PvE, like Wizards for example. But I also have wanted a "true support" that de-couples Power from Ferocity and/or Precision, too. Give me a Healing Power - Concentration Major, Power - Vitality Minor combination so I can make a beefy healer-support that doesn't sacrifice some retail space for Ferocity nor Precision.
---
Let's see a Condition Damage - Healing Power Major,  Expertise - Concentration Minor split saboteur-support attribute combination focused around crippling the enemy while also keeping allies alive, but not necessarily being the one to take the enemy down themselves.
---
I play this with my bf and a few other friends, and if I want to go True Support or True Tank to play alongside them, focusing my stats solely on what I'd need for those roles and those roles only (for fun, or to try a new gimmick), I simply can't in most instances. You can easily access DPS in a myriad of flavors, I want to see some other combinations pursued.
---
I don't regret making the Binding of Ipos but with major balance patches, they seem bent on removing projectiles from focus weapons. First mesmer, then guardian. The last remaining projectile is on Necro and it's a pathetic skill.
---
I also love Xiuquatl but not being able to use it while mounted or on a chair was a huge disappointment for me.
---
I made Flameseeker but after awhile, Shooshadoo began appealing to me because suddenly I wanted a full "zoo character" and attach as many living creatures on my character. Unfortunately, I'd rather make a different weapon because it feels like a waste.
---
Mynd you, reduced børder capacity Kan be pretti nasti...
---
Oh, I see.  I have to be tolerant of your intolerance?  hahahhaha, no. But, since I doubt you have anything to say that I need to hear, i'm just going to block you.  Toodles.
---
I'm pretty sure every pve firebrand build uses some combination of axe and scepter in mainhand and torch and/or focus in offhand.
---
Look into HP trains for HoT and PoF. You can get all the mastery points you need in one or two days.
---
The projectile is damn sick though
---
Same as my other reply, I'm pretty sure every pve firebrand build uses some combination of axe and scepter in mainhand and torch and/or focus in offhand. No builds on metabattle or snowcrows use mace.
---
Condi rev, core warrior for breaks (mace in both hands!) and qBrand. It's not thaaat useless. 
---
If you think Nevermore's effects (which barely show) are too much, why on earth would you want Bifrost instead? It's like 10 times worse in that regard.
---
Same friend. My mats are ready and waiting
---
Good bot.
---
Legendary stats: Make your own stats, either +/-- or ++/--. Anything goes.
---
It's optimal on Condi revenant, Healing firebrand, and PVE Banner warrior. I'd say you are missing out.
---
You're also missing out on raining Disco balls as Renegade
---
Condi revenant, Healbrand, PVE Banner warrior.
---
Not to mention, raining disco balls Renegade. Absolutely worth it
---
Does this work for you: [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/54421/law-lulles-advanced-world-completion-guide](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/54421/law-lulles-advanced-world-completion-guide)

I don't believe its coming out in June because Z has said they are wrapping up development on episode 6 which in the past as meant the episode released this month. Go back to season 3 MO said this alot. I think episode 6 this month after the welcome back event ends or before it. Then the raid 2 weeks after the episode which would make the raid a May update.
---
Dont use the bad ones :p
---
Preferrence I guess, I never get tired of the sound of brandishing metal.
---
I was actually just thinking this. I was ranting to play around with other boon type classes and ran into this problem of there not being any condition damage/concentration focused gear. One such guild I wanted to mess around with was condition herald, using mace&amp;shield/mace&amp;axe. Since in the invocation tree invoking herald does conditions and paired with corruption/mallyx I thought it could be fun. I think having a condition variant to commanders (so CD, Con, Tough, precision) and diviner’s (CD, Con, Expertise, precision) would be nice. I’m sure there are other combos like you stated which could lead to some very fun class builds as well. (I.e. Scourge comes to mind)
---
I feel for you. Howler is such an elegant design yet Anet has over done misty effects on other legendaries already: frostfang, shooshadoo, HMS, Claw of Khan, etc.
---
It really needs a tune up like Minstrel
---
It's a good sink for those 40k silks? i mean what the hell are you gonna do with that many bolts?
---
Wish I could upvote this more. It would definitely give Leggy armor that added umpf over ascended. I also wish I could get leggy armor.😜
---
4 stat combos were probably a mistake. Should have stuck with 3 max and introduced additional combinations with different primary stats instead. The mix for whatever you are going for. With 4 stats it becomes a harder to avoid having a wasted stat.
---
I can only agree - I personally have been having a blast playing some Diviner builds, and I woul be very enthused to play condi-support build as well. There are a lot of different combinaisons that I would love to play with - full healers for example have to either play in Magi or Harrier, both of which that have a random non-support stat.
---
Condition Damage/Healing Power/Concentration/Expertise looks perfect for a Scourge.
---
Could you explain what you are saying by  
---
&gt; Ideally, it'd have four attributes.
---
Wouldn't it be better to have three stats combinaisons, to be as undiluted as possible ? Like Condi Dmg major, Expertise and Concentration minor ?
---
It's about as appealing as fingernail on chalkboard 
---
If the story is good, I would even enjoy fighting a mudcrab.
---
The problem with Shining blade is that it makes that clanky sound when you mount/dismount, even if you're not in combat.
---
The sword itself looks gorgeous but the sound drives crazy in 15 minutes (each time you mount/dismount!).
---
And is it possible to sell eternity even though i have twilight and dawn accountbound?
---
So why keep using the term? Like, there is a place and context where that *might* be acceptable by a few people. This isn't it. Instead of half claiming ignorance / half doubling down just edit your post to say trans woman instead. It isn't hard. 
---
So uh, those pulses should be given the same radius right. It's weird that's single skill has two radio.
---
I love fighting mudcrabs. Makes me feel powerful
---
The only time violence isn't the answer, is when the question was stated in a faulty manner
---
do you even know what a troll is lol?
---
just because im upset with the game doesnt mean im a troll. not everyone has the same opinion as you
---
There should be some value attributed to time though. Basically pay 10 gold for raw mats and spend 10 minutes refining yourself, or pay maybe 12 gold for already refined mats. The 10 minutes is valued at 2 gold, and then it's up to the consumer to determine if it's high enough to refine themselves or low enough to buy direct.
---
Also consider, through sheer leveling up you get enough HP rewards to completely fill out your base class' HP needs. I popped a Level 60 booster and then 20 ToK's and I had the perfect amount of HP's to fill every single base class reward track 100%, meaning I was set-up to immediately dive into the HoT and PoF Elite Specialization tracks. If this player has been completing ~50% of the world map, then already they are sitting on a heap of extra HP's beyond filling out the base Elementalist.
---
However you’d lock yourself into a catch 22. You can’t raid without leggy armor, but you can’t get leggy armor without raiding. That would mean if your theory panned out, only those currently with leggy armor would be allowed to raid and no one else would be allowed. This would cause more than stagnation, but certain death for raids. 
---
It would basically be a supply/demand sort of situation. If they did what is laid out above raid groups would have no supply of players to meet their requirements. So groups would have to loosen up their ridiculous standards back to previous norms to have successful runs. 
---
Additionally, assuming all of this hypothetical situation came to fruition, then those groups requiring leggy armor to raid are not the type of people I’d want to play with.
---
That being said the power creep (increase in damage from various patches over the year and more optimal gear, etc.) has caused some older content to be quite easy.
---
Things get harder and more fun, and hero points come pretty quickly/easily. 
---
Heh I don't think I've actually equipped it since PoF came out
---
&gt; ...and you did experience this before...in LS1 when Scarlet destroyed all of LA (which LA never recovered from).
---
She detroyed LA, but we still got got her. We didn't face defeat, we just faced victory that held a lot of casualty..
---
Also yeah it seems that way for us because we're experiencing it in real time, but from a playthrough perspective, there wouldn't be that gap between episodes, and it'd feel extremely weird if not done right. 
---
I just wanted to say that I love your site and have used it for at least a dozen games.  Thank you for making such an excellent resource!
---
You faced defeat and then you conquered after collecting yourself and saving survivors...the same way you will here. It is no different.
---
Yeah - my main bottleneck was the Aged Ectoplasm one in Bloodstone Fen. I waited and waited, until finally the dude in the arena (I forget his name) dropped it after his event.
---
Ad infinitum is the fractal one yes? 
---
A dragon that would awaken at some point regardless, especially with the way we were handling these dragons to begin with. If it wasn't for Mordremoth, we wouldn't have ventured into Rata Novus and Taimi would be very behind in her dragon research.. meaning we may have ended up doing far more damage to the world than we already have as well. 
---
Also to note.. the very impact of the Scarlet loss/regathering is extremely underwhelming in comparison to losing our one and only hope of solving the problems we've already put on the world. At this point in the story, we can't do anything. Killing Kralk will destroy the world, but letting him go will do just the same. Even then, we exhausted our arsenal. We have no more dragonsblood weapons because Aurene can't resonate/forge them for us anymore for obvious reasons. 
---
yeah i know the options now. first time was back in 2013
---
I don't know if someone has done it already but someone should really make and tribulation mode video shot i the style of a ['nam flashback](https://img.memecdn.com/ptsd_c_7164218.jpg)
---
It does. Alacrigade guide basically boils down to "F2 and F4 on cd, alacri heal spam in ventari, heal plus elite spirit in kalla, dont use anything else to maximize uptimes". Basically the only reason why i stopped playing that build. I didnt roll revenant to stand around just like my spirits and my tablet...
---
25 might is like a 30-35% damage boost.  It's kind of insane, actually.  Definitely not something people are aware of.. 
---
And fishing will become the next thing people scream for LOL
---
Pharus. I had all its materials saved up for over a year and a half.
---
I really didn't like kudzu so I decided to prepare everything for the new bow. Even though I didn't know whats it going to look like.
---
I was pissed for the entire week before it was released because in the trailer it looked like the shittiest bland skin I had ever seen. But when it finally released I made it 5 minutes after I patched and I have never regretted anything more. 
---
Absolutely hate the bow and the fact that I made it. 
---
So much even that I don't play this game anymore, because I waited 3 years for a shitty chaos bow with armor bits.
---
Plus I main charr. so not only that I have a shitty bow with barely visible effects, it's even on a charr where you can't see any effects at all. No matter what legendary weapon you use. 
---
FSP. Wish I had gotten Shooshadoo or used the gen 1 mats for another underwater legendary. 
---
I'm just saying the thing the guy said about last sword f1 is missing the mark. Last sword f1 is barely relevant. The dps loss will come primarily from other things. That being said, There is someone who has been involved in the hardcore raiding scene for a long time that plays on 300 ping and his dps numbers are very competitive on pretty much every class.
---
I'd like to see what Maguuma looks like without all the damn vines everywhere...didn't we kill that dragon like a THOUSAND
---
Yes pls!
---
Same for me with my DH. I actually enjoy using LB, but for most group play it just won’t fly, which is a bummer. I love my Kudzu though 
---
But so pretty... I want it so much
---
thank u!!
---
I want to craft a set of Sinister Gear.
---
But seeing as they're account bound, doesn't that only matter if you've leveled scribing?
---
W1-Z2*?
---
Ask any mesmer main how their class is doing and you will get a very detailed rundown on all the recent and historical efforts by anet to bring mesmer down. You are simplyfying a very complex class and its balance.
---
&gt; it's probably not something we'd get to for quite some time. We have a lot on our plate already.
---
Understandable, but thanks for at least checking into it for us :)
---
open world in HoT is definitely the most challenging in gw2, it drops again in PoF tho since to many cried about on forum that they cant solo the content (in an mmo...) and die with random **** builds 
---
Not hardly. We barely touched Kralkatorrik in the overall fight and even then it cost us our best weapon (that we know of at this point). By the time we go back at Kralkatorrik he'll be fine. 
---
&gt;kicks
---
In the first ten seconds, commander can simply call for a wipe and kick the imposter, easy enough.
---
&gt;Once you've hit level 80, it will also become way more common to receive tomes of knowledge that you can use to level
---
Ain't that ass-backwards? ;-P
---
So, is it one class per team or can there be multiple with different amulets? The rules seem a bit contradictory in this regard.
---
It is. If you forge both of them you can sell the eternity.
---
We ran several load playtests during development and we decided that the increase in load wasn't unmanageable. In some cases, it might actually be cheaper to have players mounted, as while mounted, you have access to fewer player skills, which can be expensive.   
---
All that being said, we've been looking at a lot of new telemetry lately and are doing some targeted changes to help with server load. Things like looking at which skill scripts are very expensive. But at this point in the game, it's likely we'll find a silver bullet for server performance. It's going to be hundreds of small improvements.  
---
An example! One weird thing we discovered when going through this was that NPC AI actually is actually considering walls and gates when choosing targets. This makes no sense, since they can't really effectively damage them. So removing this from their behavior is coming soon. While you probably won't notice a server performance increase just from this change, it's finding more things like this that will help things over time.
---
I use Carrion for WvW roaming :V
---
Swashbuckler isn't too bad on some pvp-oriented builds and Avatar is used on some megaminmax wvw roam builds iirc
---
Have you tried SAB? It’s a popular festival currently happening in Rata Sum. It won't be around forever, only appearing a few weeks a year. 
---
You can do some achievements to unlock a mini, or farm bauble baubles for the awesome SAB boomboxes :) Do check it out!
---
A trans woman is someone who was assigned male at birth and has since transitioned to live as a woman. Effectively, what you were likely trying to refer to in the first place.
---
It is good that you are trying to understand and that is appreciated but if you don't want somewhat curt responses, you shouldn't be hostile to people that are just trying to inform you. Thank you for listening and considering though. 
---
This needs more upvotes
---
^^^to ^^^revive
---
just download the client from the website.
---
Since your original install from the disks would need to be updated quite heavily with two expansions, I doubt that using disk install will safe you much time anyways.
---
So basically, I can use my serial number and play the game without any issues? 
---
Shut up Malchor, you're drunk! 
---
yes
---
Seems to work at a quick glance, thanks! 
---
I get ya. There are definitely things within the gaming community as a whole, GW2 included, that lend themselves to elitism or exclusivity. I wholeheartedly despise that mentality. When you are playing a game for other than competitive play, the goal should be to have fun. However you(not you directly) want to achieve that fun is fine, just don’t impose that methodology on others and in turn cause them to not have fun. Competitive play gets weird so I won’t comment on that. 
---
I think a main problem right now is “meta” game play mechanics. I raided a fuck ton in vanilla, BC, and WotLK , as well as Wildstar, and GW2 is the only community I’ve found that puts emphasis on speed. It’s like they are on a racetrack with tunnel vision. So fractals, raid, etc all feel so hollow. I have so amazing memories about doing dungeons and raids where you went in, you killed the guys and had a fun time doing it for that 30 mins to 6 hours (depending on game type and etc). GW2 community makes it feel like if you didn’t get all your fractal dailies done in 15 minutes then you should quit the game. No one even really talks to anyone anymore. Same happened with league of legends when it first came out. Great community, with post game discussions, now when a game finishes its auto leave, re-queue. 
---
Idk, rant over I suppose, maybe it’s just people in general now, but it seems like genuine connections and friendships, especially in games, are lost on most people. 
---
PS I didn’t mean to offend you or get you riled up. Take care.
---
Yes. You don't even need the serial(but do keep it around somewhere safe) if you remember your login details.
---
This is a great description. OP, it sounds like you’ve been doing some of the least interesting content in the oldest maps of the game, and it’s understandable that it’s felt like a grind so far. 
---
Even though levels 1-79 are good for players who are new to MMOs,  I usually recommend that experienced MMO players like OP consider boosting their first character to 80 to enjoy the newest and most interesting content right away. But since you’re already at level 73, OP, it sounds like this advice might be too late. 
---
I hope you can give the expansion content a chance. I think you will find the maps more interesting and difficult. 
---
GW2 had disks? I have pre purchase box with nothing but a code inside.
---
witch hunting?
---
Yeah, the gear won't be very useful until the max level zones, but the crafting materials from mid-level zones can often be valuable.  But it's the charges and the chance of a key that would be the main lure.
---
It's perfectly fine, still, to not worry about it.  You won't be locked out of anything except Legendary weapons by not completing zones/the world.  Well, there actually are some special Ascended weapons in the two expansions that require completion of a single expansion zone of your choice to unlock, so there's that too, but that's expansion stuff and you're a long ways away from that as well!
---
yeah, I am rude or hostile in my comments on this sub quite often so I was quite disappointed when I realized what OP was talking about...
---
Yes ... well this is a problem with scribing. This could  be fixed by adding a proxy decoration
---
Are you this youtuber's mom?
---
I always thought it was a direct 1-1 ratio up to 25%, no wonder my rev does so much damage only with basics
---
Oooo. Still working on that one. Been so sick though 
---
As a F2P in a zerg, Guardian is basically your only option.   
---
Roaming-wise, Thief and Warrior do okay. 
---
There used to be a very nice power hammer meta in pvp and then I realized I have very few hammer skins 
---
No no.. thank you for explaining. I just experience, more often than not, getting labeled as flat out *judgmental* and *ignorant* for not knowing my terms. It's frustrating when someone is blindly believing that the world has miraculously accepted and started to use all the terms.. Sure, if one has grown up with such condition or know close ones that do, they are exposed to topics and become curious (which often leads to being knowledgeable about the topic), but then there are also those who do not have the opportunity to even meet one and it doesn't even come across in the curiosity stages. Progress will be made for sure.
---
You lost more than LA to Scarlet. You lost everything following her attacks, including losing Eir. It's a cascading effect...not isolated from each other.
---
Couple of hours of story gameplay is also not couple of hours "in-story". That argument flies both ways.
---
In either case, dragging on her return for a whole season serves little to no purpose, besides dragging on the story and will in turn have a far more negative effect, than a positive one. The proper (and most likely) way to end episode 6 is with her return.
---
Well, that guy did.
---
The unnamed [Deep Sea Dragon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deep_sea_dragon), often referred to as "Bubbles," "Steve," and other variations over the years. As of right now, it's the only dragon that we know next to nothing about.
---
It's ok
---
How much did he pay you in hope to get clicks from us?
---
Thank you! Its kinda awkward but I've been playing on and off since release of gw2...just never got to endgame. I blame my friends honestly and Destiny. 
---
If you mouseover map completion summary, the uncompleted locations will flash. It helps a lot :)
---
Are you saying that is way too obvious that OP is the player that got banned and now wants the YouTuber to fall too?
---
There's a different between trash talking and going off the deep end. Pretty sure the scale tips pretty hard for using the N word and telling someone to off themselves.   
---
Also... why are you censoring the work "suck?"  
---
no, everyone thinks that OP is the mesmer, and the twist is he's not
---
What is the single episode of Living World most worth buying? I have only 200 gems, and everything before S4E4 locked. I know S4E3 unlocks the roller beetle, and I've also read that Lake Doric from S3E4 is a good location to farm leather/gold, although idk if that's outdated now. So from a perspective of unlocking useful stuff, be it mounts or good farming locations for gold or other things, what's the best episode to unlock?
---
Yes, that's also the legendary I partly regret. Still like the aesthetics, but with no reasonable PvE spec being able to use hammer, it constantly sits unused in my guard's inventory, waiting for better days.
---
You'll never win. Ever. No matter how much you try to appease and capitulate, they will undoubtedly find some issue with whatever you're saying. I get why you're trying, but it's futile. 
---
Nevermore pre-nerf, since it became so much cheaper and easier to make event-wise later.
---
And Juggernaut, for reasons already listed in thread (underused, mainly).
---
Congrats!  It's a good feeling!
---
I... I expected this to be a SAB-season joke post.

S4E2 is free in the gemstore right now. In a few days it's likely that S4E3 will be free too.

So wholesome...
---
Yeah, i just want 500 so that i can experiment with both and see what works out best for me, im excited to see what i can find!
---
But these community-ran trains sound so good, i might have to involve myself with the people around me more, participating in that train will certainly aliviate a lot of hassle!
---
What are those pants? I love them OwO 
---
Also had it happen to me in Hidden Depths when using those orbs. 
---
Happened a lot tbh and I hate judging what will glitch the mount out rather than de-mount me 
---
The disk is only if you have no internet access while installing the game.  
---
The serial key you got is for creating an account (basically).  
---
So the only thing that means anything is your account; you can download the game from the official webpage.

HOPE because none the characters I usually play can even use it. I've had it equipped for maybe an hour of gameplay and I made it over a month ago. It'll see usage some day, I'm sure.

What am I doing wrong? I've done The Shatterer here and there, Behe, and still, 15+ events later - still no cake!
---
Thank you all for the helpful comments, both positive and negative, ive learned a lot from this thread today, many thanks to this community for helping me out!

Ive replied to some of the top comments with what i learned and such, make sure to read those if you are looking for updates from me.

Thanks again for the help!

The definition is ignorant is “lacking knowledge or awareness in general” and “lacking knowledge, information, or awareness about a particular thing” so you are by definition ignorant about this particular topic. 
---
I didn’t grow up with those terms, I come from a homophobic/racist/transphobic country so my culture growing up taught me negatives until I moved and become aware of them and went out my way to teach myself. It is not anyone else’s job but your own to do that, so if you contribute to a discussion without doing so beforehand, you can understand why some people will be hostile. 
---
Scapper has some cool unique support and decently strong healing. 
---
&gt; Could you explain what you are saying by
---
&gt;&gt; Ideally, it'd have four attributes.
---
&gt; Wouldn't it be better to have three stats combinaisons, to be as undiluted as possible ? Like Condi Dmg major, Expertise and Concentration minor ?
---
From a highly simplistic perspective, four-attribute combinations give higher *total* stats. For example, an ascended chest piece with a four-attribute combination gives a total of 376 points (distributed among its four attributes), whereas an ascended chest piece with a three-attribute combination gives a total of 343 points (distributed among its three attributes). So if the four attributes in question are desirable, then it's generally better than a similar three-attribute combination.
---
Ooh nice. What about in S3? I've read something about unbound magic, and also lake Doric. Is there an episode I should get from D3?
---
I could easily make the argument that Scarlet's attack was not responsible for Eir's death in the first place and is barely tangently responsible. Eir, and the rest of the Pact vastly underestimated the Jungle Dragon and that lead to her death. Sure, if the dragon hadn't woken up, she wouldn't have been there in the first place, but her death (and the deaths of the Pact members) would have happened when they made the [plot induced stupidity] decision to rush into a fight head first against an opponent they know NOTHING about. Foolhardy battle decisions always leads to unecessary deaths in GW (think Snaff).
---
I get your couple-hours argument, however a majority of the playerbase won't be in the mindset that Aurene's death and her pending ressurection take place days/weeks/months/years/whatever apart. It's common practice when making products for people that you "cater to the dumb" and make information easy to digest without much thinking. 
---
A single episode isn't enough time for Aurene's death to set in. I agree that dragging on her return serves zero purpose, but only 1 episode, even if if it takes place months later, isn't good storytelling from an out of narrative standpoint. They can and will consider people playing through these episodes later one right after the other. If Aurene dies in one episode, only to be brought back from bullshit-ex-machina the very next, it immediately invalidates her death. The only way bringing her back right now works is for us playing in real time, just like a TV show the Living World has been likened to, and Anet has abandoned that concept all together. 
---
Basically, for those of us that witnessed her death right as it released, sure bringing her back next episode might be nice because we've been waiting for months, but for those who are going to play these episodes all at once (returning and new players mostly), it's not going to feel like her death mattered at all. What they really need to do in my opinion is have Kralkatorrik launch an attack on us while we're already weakened and mourning to end off the season. Then, next season bring in said bullshit-ex-machina plot point to bring her back. Spend 2 or 3 episodes bringing her back and then ramp up with whatever new found power we'll have going back at Kralk and bringing us back on track. 
---
There's no specific date I'm aware of, but they're usually organised in advance. Some post on Reddit well in advance, some post an lfg listing a few hours before. Be careful to check the region it's in, there's no cross-play between NA and EU.
---
IMO the best part about this game is the scale of the major events. Something special about taking down a massive wyvern with a squad of 50, or cooperating across an entire map with a full 100 to progress map-wide events. The community (while not perfect), is also the friendliest online game community I've played with. People are generally very helpful and kind, especially if you let them know you're new.
---
Mists/Space, please.
---
The story already gave us a taste of low-gravity mounts, and a map fully set in space would be fantastic.
---
Oh yes, clearly advertising at a gaming convention wouldn't entice new clients. That'd be silly! They need to advertise for the audience which is actually likely to play their game, so they should be advertising at the Omnitracks User Conference.
---
This is the best they can do, because obviously this is the only form of advertising they're doing. I'm sure they have no ads online. The ones I see posted must have been posted by generous players who want to advertise the game they play, not the company itself.
---
If only there were some way to advertise the game to enthusiastic gamers who are likely to share their advertisement with thousands of other people, that'd be fantastic. Maybe if there were a place where lots of gamers went together and the advertisement was flashy enough to draw attention, that'd be possible. Sounds like it can't be done, though, so I guess the best they can do is put a flashy advertisement at a gaming convention.
---
God, I loved that show 😭
---
So true.
---
Back when I did my legendary I picked frostfang because I enjoyed the looks, luckily nowadays I use it on my soulbeast, reaper, warrior, mirage and renegade.
---
Damn it's good. Also Jonny rocks!
---
Is it very different from tekkit's path?
---
OP said they raided in WoW and FFXIV. Both of which you can go to old raids and literally one shot bosses.
---
Ok thanks, 
---
It wasn't clear, even on the wiki,
---
I thought perhaps If I buy the last expansion I could have all of them (and just not the Revenant class).
---
Thank you (and everyone else too) :)
---
The only irrelevant people are the ones who call open communication a joke. Have a good one. 
---
W2Z3 is awesome for the most part, but the ice room drives me insane, I hate that part.
---
Mine is always a little vista in the top right corner of Plains of Ashford. It's a peaceful place with a small grove nearby. I like to take a screenshot and sit there for a while whenever I finish world completion.
---
Congratulations... now do it again! :P
---
That's a good one to end on, feels very much like you really *have* explored the world. 
---
The difference when a company listens and not listens the community is huge. This is what we need. Constant communication. Great job, keep it up.
---
The first time? It sure does. I didn't do what OP did, but I did call my family over to watch me get that last vista in Timberline Falls. After that, I got "Waypoint Completion," where I would do the PVE dailies on a character that didn't have that map in order to have more waypoints and be able to travel around in case of an event I wanted to do. But I did have to push myself a little to do it a second time, and if my wife wasn't doing it for her first time, I might not be working on it as much as I am. Still... it's not a bad thing, and if you have mounts and gliding unlocked, it's a little easier, too. 
---
If you have HoT, I think you'll appreciate the difficulty step that happens when you step through the door from Amber Sandfall in the Silverwastes into Shipwreck Peak in Verdant Brink.
---
At 1:23, it changes from tekkit/dulfy's shared path to dulfy's path. At 2:30, it changes to a path I haven't seen before, skipping a checkpoint. At 3:23, it returns to dulfy's path. And 3:30 it matches tekkit/dulfy except the open field, which is mostly safe and not difficult.
---
So I just looked up the Viewing Hill since I didn't find that in game, either.  That was underwhelming, too.  It's like a 30-second run from the Heart of Foefire.  After having read that book the Plains of Ashford makes the entire area seem so much larger than it actually is in game.  I expected the viewing hill to be on the opposite side of the map.
---
Frog in the left bottom corner "please dont make the the splashes hit my face, please dont ma.. OH COME ON!"
---
So many games do this, I hate it. Makes competitive settings that much more stressful.
---
I am in no way looking to buy a legendary from the trading post, but I've noticed that the Nevermore isn't being sold on the TP. Are there any specific reason for that, or is it just too time consuming to sell? 
---
You seem like a fun person to be around
---
/s
---
Correct way to finish world completion is RP walking up the steps towards the entrance to Arah.
---
Yeah, and that's where I have to decide to let my suspension of disbelief take over. I'm not super interested in it taking me as long as it took them to trek across the Brand.
---
It's science,you are born either male or female
---
A lot of things described in the books end up being seriously scaled down in the game. The in-game Tyria is like a caricature of the world, as evidenced by some of the travel times described in the books that clearly do not translate to the game.
---
So it probably is meant to represent something bigger and more impressive as described in the books.
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
Predator i made it anticipation for deadeye and was sorely disappointed with it now it just sits in my inventory.

Happened to me in BFF. You can fix it by using any chair.

This guide is done pre-mounts, but is still a really great guide. All the credit to Lulle \^\^

It is neat! I am just triggered by the title, is all.

At first, I thought he was taking a dump... then realized he was just crouching.
---
Then I saw the splash...
---
Little did Ciri know, but she was being spied on while she was running through the swamp by Johnny.... who was pooping. 
---
Basically skipping all the parts that gave me lots of trouble when I farmed my 15 tokens years ago (and of course when I did it for achiev in 2013). Amazing.
---
Yeah, at that point, it's basically incentivizing you not to play. 
---
To add, always check the collection on the wiki and see if you can buy any items.  Lots of times they are cheap af on the tp.  
---
You do?
---
This is amazing! So creative.
---
Grow up a bit. Books never translate the way we expect them to in other forms of media. Hell, in Star Wars books lightsaber wounds BLEED. When was the last time you saw blood in Star Wars? BEFORE Disney.
---
While the book has more freedom to describe things to be epic the game doesnt count with same freedom, more so because its an MMO. Limits are larger than on any singleplayer game. Not to mention that the entire world is scaled down massively to accomodate players.
---
No one would want to take hours to go from one end of DR to the exit and then another few days to get to Shaemoor.
---
But we havent lost everything. 
---
That makes sense, and I must say that I agree with them. Thank you! 
---
That skip at 2:30 is great, ive never seen that before, with no enemies and no death zones it should make it really straight forward, and if you can dodge jump you could probably do that faster, good job.
---
All we need now is a nice skip like this in W2Z3 :D
---
&gt; with 200ping
---
When was the last time you played with 200 ping? I mean, I come a third world country so 200 ping is my day to day. On a good day, 125.
---
Knowing the majority of players who end up hitting a ping of 100 go batshit crazy and frustrated, I cant imagine anyone willingly subjecting themselves to 200 or more ping just to play with a few more people.
---
I hope I'm not jumping in too late here, but I'm actually running my monthly HoT Map Completion train this Saturday. Assuming you can get basic gliding by then (complete the second chapter of the HoT story and level up the mastery), I highly recommend you hop along with us. I'm on my phone so I cant link very well, but if you check my post history, you can find my advertisement post.
---
We almost always have 80+ people following along, and there's tons of memes and fun and death. We move at an easy pace, so as long as you're not afk'ing and deliberately running off on your own, you shouldn't have too much trouble following along even if you're new! :D
---
of course
---
Downright glorious
---
Cant remember the game it happened in, but I once lost rating for winning because the other team had a much lower rank but got matched due to lack of players that day.
---
holy shit you got blown out. Did you lose a player?
---
yeah, when I read about Ebonhawke and then saw it ingame, it was totally different. Probably the same size overall but was way more epic in description in the second book :D
---
In the book it was on a hill and ingame it is more in a valley?
---
It’s his favorite thing to do in the morning.
---
I have 50 something Damask, Elonian Leather and such... my issue is really just the Hardened Leather for the Gossamer Patches.
---
As for what tier i am going for... i am just wanting to go for Exotic right now to try out a build and see if i like it, and then go for an appropriate Ascended.
---
I already have a Rampager and Berserker set, but the build i came up would need precision and condition damage.. ideally some Power... thus i want to get myself a set of Sinister Exotic gear.. i do have level 400 crafters of every variety... its really just me asking and looking for input on what people recommend where to go to get materials these days.
---
I played quite intensively up until about the release of Path of Fire. But any input is still greatly appreciated :) I am just not starting at absolute zero :)
---
So thank you :)
---
At least in no tribulation mode you can skip it all with the eagle, and even if you think it's too cheaty, going through the clouds makes it a bearable level. But in tribulation it's just hell on Earth.

I actually was around for when leather was this insane and its a bit sad it still hasn't come down all to much. Compared to other materials it seems extraordinarily expensive. But yeah, nothing like pre-lake doric times.

Star wars movies happened before books. In this case, book happened before the game.

Does he have coffee before?

I explored as I read the book, about every other chapter. Lots of fun but yeah the image in my head reading the book, even knowing the game world so well, it was different.

getting to the worm period is difficult (if possible) in trib mode. Also after getting pooped out of the worm om trib

mode, I'm not sure if there's a safe path to get to the boss.
---
Yea see that’s my problem. I always main warrior in most games. They both are aesthetically pleasing, and both look very fun. Engineers blow everything up with cool gadgets. This is so difficult 
---
Thank you very much

If you have a guild hall with resource synthesizers, especially leather synthesizers, gathering from those daily is a decent and easy way to get some materials. There are also synthesizers at most objectives in WvW. Each city has a gathering vendor who sells special gathering tools for karma, which give a chance for special effects like extra hits, rare materials, and dropping certain materials like watchwork mechanisms, cloth, and leather. If you've got a decent amount of karma (they're 4900 each, iirc), grabbing a set of leather tools is a good idea.
---
Crafting and selling daily timegated items is also a good source of gold. If you have LS2 and have gotten far enough in crafting Mawdrey, the plant foods and other items are good daily crafts (especially the plant food, since you can buy all the mats from the TP for pretty cheap). If you have LS3E3, the dragon doll pieces are also decent crafts. And of course there are the ascended materials (deldrimor steel, spiritwood, etc.). You can use sites like https://www.gw2craftgold.com/ to find good things to craft and the best way to get something (like what pieces to craft vs buy), plus this specific site has a nice "easy money" section that lists the items with the most profit from buying mats at sell price, crafting, and selling at buy price.

I don't know about getting sinister gear, though. Unless the fight is really short, viper's is usually better, plus much easier to farm most materials for (sheets of charged ambrite are timegated from charged quartz, while black diamonds aren't too difficult to get). Although viper's does require flax, but that's not too bad to farm (the Great Tree above Ogre Camp in TD is a good spot, plus there's another in VB but I can't remember exactly where). If you're planning on going into raids eventually as a condi class, I'd suggest crafting viper's instead so you won't have to later. Otherwise, rampager's is probably fine compared to sinister for open world and whatnot, and is much cheaper.
---
Would you be the one riding it or carrying it?
---
I saw Gullik there but didn't connect the stones to Killeen.  :(
---
Nah, it's actually more than that.  It's both 750 power and 750 condition damage.  Most classes in full zerkers or viper have something like 2000-2250 of either stat, so yeah.  25 might is a *huge* boost. 
---
Ahh, ok in that case yeah. Best leather farm is Lake Doric. Vipers is best in-slot for condition damage rn because it gives expertise as well, but if you're doing exotic then don't really bother cos you have to spend a ridiculous (feels like) amount of gold on linseed oils lol
---
You can get material crates for volatile magic (best VM farm rn is Sandswept/Kourna, RIP Istan), leather and trophies are worth, but the leather doesn't drop a lot of t6, mostly drops t5 and t3 iirc (majority will be t5)
---
Yeah. That was my old account. It's deleted now and there's no way for me to retrieve it anymore. Everything gone including the dragon finisher. 
---
When thinking back I always wanna say Edge of Destiny is better, just on first instinct. Maybe because we actually get to know the characters in the game. But consciously I know that Ghosts of Ascalon is the better book. It's a weird conondrum.
---
Using his shitter senses
---
It was a pretty much unwinnable game, believe we had 2 tempest and a druid vs a 5 stack of semi competent players so yea....
---
Primitive armor, obtained from, Karma merchants in Fireheart rise and Orr.
---
There should be a vendor machine in the lobby to trade weapons we unlocked on a char for other characters.
---
Awesome thanks for doing this, I just added you on discord, I'm gonna try to be apart of the entire train from the beginning lol
---
&gt;The whole premise of what causes Elder Dragons to awaken really threw me off, as what I thought was established at launch has slowly been turned on its head.
---
I thought that was the point of the whole twist that killing Zhaitan made everything worse. The dragons weren't "supposed" to die, they were supposed to continue their cycle of eating magic and then going back into hibernation. But then we came along and we basically fucked the natural-order so far up by not only fighting back, but actuallying winning.
---
I want Sharur but hammer is useless :(
---
What happened?
---
Well yeah, but there's no actual nudity or anything.
---
Did you know ranger has dagger offhand?
---
&gt;It's not 4 months in-story though. The game's story doesn't take place in our real-time.
---
But if we go by that, then in the short timeframe PoF and Season 4 takes place in, we killed a god, started and ended a war with a lich we also got killed and managed to personally fight another elder dragon.
---
The story isn't real-time, but i think the wait between episodes is actually measured in weeks, if not months.
