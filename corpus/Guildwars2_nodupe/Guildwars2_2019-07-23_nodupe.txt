If they release 2-4 hours of content every 6 months (living world) then that's... 12 hours of content a year, to be generous.
---

---
A "hardcore" person doing their weekly clear is still putting in 30 minutes, every week, and then going external to network with others and engage in the product externally. That's still 26 hours of gameplay in a year. Also it's likely the hardcore person is also gobbling up the same content the average player is doing, and so I'd add those 12 hours as well. That's 38 hours, not bad. 
---
I feel like this just reinforced my point.
---
---
---
Its almost like wow caters to the hardcore players.
---
As someone who's played both, ff14's got a much better /actual/ formula for 'play a month or two, leave for a few months, come back, repeat' cadence. Too much of GW2's dev time is spent on adding new /cash shop/ cosmetics, which aren't an enjoyable goal to work towards because actually making enough money to get significant amounts of gems is unpleasant and frustrating for the majority of players who are not market barons. Not to mention the actual methods of getting significant sums of gold is mostly stale.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
GW2 to me is like an example of the folly of relying entirely on cash shop cosmetics to pay for new content - in the end, more and more dev time is directed to making new cash shop things and less and less towards actual things you can unlock via gameplay.
---
Jebus, and I was pissed at myself for averaging 2 hours a day over the last 6 years.
---
Better to seemingly underestimate the "power of the community" than overestimate.
---
How can this game be hardcore, it has no power progression.
---
&gt; Aside from expansions, which can't be bought with Gems, they do not invest a lot of money into the game.  
---
funny, i know several hardcore players with a lot more then just 5 accounts and a shitton of gemstore stuff because they simply drop a few bucks each month into the shop.
---
Then why disagree at all? Solving an issue like this, if it even has a solution, won't come by pretending it doesn't exist. Failure to acknowledge issues does not mean they do not exist.
---
...why is your immediate assumption that hardcore players don’t spend money?  In my experience the crazier you are about a game the more you are willing to spend additional money.
---
It’s honestly kind of common sense that the hardcore base drives most games.  They create the content, the builds, and metas.  Almost every game dies pretty quickly as soon as it’s abandoned by the hardcore base.
---
lol.
---
Ben P refuses to do a new game mode I PvP citing “it would split the community”. For a company that is always trying to challenge status quo, pvp has to be the most vanilla BS ever.
---
Literally.
---
I don't expect much from LS5, and I'm not really expecting an Xpac 3 at this point. 
---
The end of LS4 seemed pretty _"Series FINale"_ to me and really, if they did make an XPac 3 based on Cantha I'd skip it and be really done. I'm sick of re-treading the same ground I saw _12 years ago_ in GW1. If they make Guild Wars 3, I'll also skip it cause I know what to expect after 12 years. 
---
If they can't actually shake it up and do something _new_, that's what's really going to kill them. 
---
That and most all the content can be done near solo. Including WvW, and many fractals, if you really try. I can get better single player games and stories _in my single player games._
---
I liked the short window but it did feel like if you didn't play daily, you missed a lot.  It doesn't help that LS1 never returned.
---
I think they are readying it for maintenance mode to move on to GW3.
---
It isn't the hardcore players we want to leave. Hardcore players are awesome! It is the toxic players we don't want. If a large percentage of those happen to be hardcore players, oh well.
---
I don't think I can blame anyone for feeling apathetic and dejected about the state of this game. I doubt it will be as large as they want it to be given Anet's history of overpromising and then underdelivering. And much of that was when GW2 was a newer game. And so many things have taken so long to be added. Many still aren't.
---
Ahahahahaha you madman, spot on comment
---
Yup the game pulls in the same amount after xpacs every time. That number is worth less as inflation increases. Mismanagement of the company and lack of community outreach leads to layoffs.
---
Next time come with something other that “Wrong. yeah I whinnnnnn”
---
Currently: A dead game walking.
---
&gt; Don't get hit.  
---
Can you even get hit anyway? :')
---
&gt;None of this is "content" that's meant to be replayable
---
  
---
It seems like Anet realized around Bloodstone Fen -&gt; Ember Bay -&gt; Iced Berry Land that pumping maps out constantly made players happy at the time, and has stuck to that ever since without re-examining it. At that time we were in a point with GW2 where a lot of time had been poured into TLC on existing systems/areas, so new content so rapidly was something different and welcomed. But you can't press that agenda forever as an MMO dev. MMO content is made to be replayed, grinded out, and to "stick", something that is persistent to the world. But since every team in Anet is focused on pressing forward, we haven't seen that serious look back from the company, with patches that sharpen up that past content and draw into relevance pieces which fell out of favor. Adding a bonus lootbox to map boss farms is the closest we've seen to some TLC on older content for a while and...I don't really \*care\* about an extra box of 1% chance of worthwhile loot.
---
What GW2 Vanilla did which really drew me in, was it valued player interaction as the primary objective. People doing stuff with and around each other. Which the field combo system did an excellent job of making combat more open to strangers doing content around/with other strangers. Raids weren't a thing because gear grind for power wasn't the point. People were the point. And the original design of dungeons (before stack meta nuked it) was really in that vein too. Where people were trying to piece together different skills to create solutions to problems presented outside of stat concerns. Changing each dungeon as you found people with different classes trying to mesh together.
---
These days PvE to me feels...more like a gear grind game. You roller coaster through whatever map is newest until you get the new (fashion) gear from it before people stop bothering with it, then you afk until the next patch with a map. Doing any vanilla or past content being largely irrelevant to go back to unless you're farming World Completion for gold or legendaries. So I've largely the past year or two just stuck to WvW, entering PvE in bursts every couple patches to do the new content, ignore the fashion for farming it, and then calling it a day. None of the maps have felt engaging enough to be something I \*want\* to explore endlessly or spend large amounts of time in. None have felt truly polished, or interesting to do with random assortments of strangers in the same way that defending a farm from Bandits, and then going on the offensive and attacking their Queensdale stronghold to hold the area at a temporary peace. I feel like in all of this rampant content and change, the game kind of...forgot what it was once good at.  
---
To me as a Veteran, the game has a lot of QoL improvements and shiny things which have been added with time which are neat and all, but the core game is just not as directly \*good\* as it used to be. I miss the kinetic nature of vanilla combat, and the depth that was brought out of making the most out of a simplified bar with skills which weren't innately over the top or fancy, but when brought together with other skills could be incredible. I miss the world of pre-resistance and chronomancer, of hammers and blasting water fields. And I don't think we'll ever really see anything that outright engaging again from the game.
---
I'll raise my hand as a guy who probably is deserved to be told "bro just play something else", but as somebody who likes the format of WvW, the competition isn't out yet, so we have a wait ahead of us on that front I guess.
---
&gt; Solving an issue like this,
---
The current issue:
---
* ArenaNet spreading itself too thin with Raids, PvP and WvW instead of pouring all of their efforts into high amounts of frequently released, highly accessible, highly replayable PvE.
---
The counter-issue:
---
* All the other token fringe audiences vocally pushing their content desires on the social media as if GW2 was targeted specifically at them.
---
Yup exactly. Even if they did a dramatic shift away from the normal guild wars 2 it would still provide a new way to play. Bringing life to the game. Something missing the last 2 years.
---
Agree with the maintenance, combat, qol. But you got it wrong with the alt unfriendliness. Ffxiv is even waaay more alt friendly with being able to switch jobs on the fly. Unless i misunderstood?
---
True GW2 endgame is played on reddit after quitting the game you invested thousands of hours in.
---
Pure delusion. Most hardcore players I know have almost every class geared and play what they want.
---
I think the problem is that the loudest complainers want the game to be something it purposefully isn't and that most people don't want it to be.
---
Like, it's one thing to complain because you hated the story for the last LS or feel like there's no incentive to explore old maps that you kinda miss. These are things that Anet could fix that wouldn't really change what Gw2 is, and improve on what it is. 
---
But a lot of complaints I see are "I need more legendaries to craft"/"Game is too easy"/"Need more focus on PvP"/etc--stuff that it's clear Anet doesn't do on purpose because the majority of its base is people who don't play every day, who invest some time in the game, maybe come back in a few weeks, and spend money to catch up when necessary, and who don't care about competitive play or have every legendary in the game yet. If someone's complaining that the game isn't hard enough, then yeah, they need to get creative, take a break from the game, or find a new one, because this game just isn't going to leave casual players behind to cater to the top 10% who have played so much they can do all the content in their sleep.
---
They really need to say their development plans. Right now I don't know if they're doing anything but festivals and living story
---
Don't worry, lishtenbird is almost as bad as lordkrall, you won't get through to them with logic.
---
Yeah and the so called hardcore players are very loudly announcing that they are. Kinda funny to be honest.
---
And they're all leaving, and with them a lot of other players. Fractal players leave because of no more CMs and the newer fractals being really "meh" to "omfg fuck siren's", Raiders leave because of lack of content, way too easy raids for hardcore people, too difficult ones for noobs to get into. PvP scene died years and the last few people are also leaving because of the lack of balacing and it being simply unfun, WvW players are most likely to stay since their mode is just meh and just gets ignored but they're still somehow there + balancing issues and Dungeon players.... welp, the 50 left there are just merging pathes and are exploiting the shit out of everything. The only people happy are casuals who can only play like 4hours at a weekend and who just care about fashion, story, exploring and festivals, which is fine but everybody who spends more time in this game will run out of fun things to do.... I really wish it wouldn't be that way.
---
And ofc, he has a say in creating a new pvp game mode...
---
Love this concept. Sad it's not implemented.
---
So you're saying that content for veterans shouldn't exist, because the people who have played the game the longest, and have literally spent the more time and cash on a game, are not the target audience all along
---
The target audience is...casuals? Who comes and go? Because they're casuals?
---
I've played one month after beta released, I DO have everything I need, and I go on to do the story, complete the map, get off. There are issues with the game, trying to divert the attention away from that fact doesn't mean it doesnt exist.
---
Casuals don't have nearly as much unlocked as hardcore players, so the hardcore content needs only to be repeatable and replayably content that is rewarding. This is entirely subjective, but you can at least agree that this is a good starting point. I can go on and on about what needs to be fixed in this game
---
I think the problem isn’t hardcore people are leaving. It’s veterans are leaving ( the two go hand in hand). And the newer players are like “good leave.”
---
Where are you getting your information from? Do you have any examples, links, or proof to back up your claims?
---
How do you define hardcore or casual? Wouldn't a community member who is invested enough in the game to engage it outside the game be considered hardcore? What's the definition? How can you prove hardcore players aren't spending money, and it's casual players?
---
Content drought has little to do with it, ffxiv is just Really good.
---
If you leveling then dailys and gathering nodes (some are worth more then others) and sell. Gathering you can do easy whilst you move in areas were you level and you will get quite a lot of gold if you pick the right one. Check on the trading post which are worth the most.
---
“We”
---
It doesn't
---
Take a business class. Or watch basic business. Then come back and talk.
---
I'm lead in my project in my company, but that doesn't allow me management decisions.
---
Where else are they meant to go? The forums? That won't work because of the way the moderators are. 
---
&gt;Hardcore players in a non-hardcore game cannot be the most dedicated players because there's literally not enough content for them.
---
You're so close to understanding, and yet you refuse to.
---
I would rather eat glass than run one of these world bosses again.
---
"You have been playing for 20 hours. Please take a break", it's a Guild Wars tradition.
---
My approach to playing this game is: About half the days of the week I log in for my daily rewards and then I log out. The other days I play with friends for an average of about 3 hours and I'm good. Even though it's my main MMORPG, I don't play GW2 to excess and as a result it stays fairly fresh.
---
You don't need to take long breaks off in order for the game to stay enjoyable, just don't treat it like GW2 is your second job.
---
This is not the QoL he is talking about. He is talking about one of the most convoluted UI ever, the clicking that is worse than here, that everything is locked behind the story, that their wardrobe is not shared among characters, that only now they are moving to world visiting, that their app has benefits behind another paywall, despite being one of the most expensive subs in the industry.
---
Their content is amazing, but they are as greed as gw2 gemstore while taking too long to implement a lot of stuff.
---
Can't believe I'm saying this but I'm waiting for Overwatch role queue to go on live servers and then I'm out as well. FeelsBadMan.
---
&gt;They told us they're still committed to the game, they told us the plans they have and more about the specifics of what's coming in the next few patches 
---
When is the next raid and fractal? Will there ever be a new wvwvw map?
---
On the hand I feel ya, but on the other hand, GW1 is still running.  Pretty sure GW2 isn't just gonna disappear, worst case scenario is slower content updates.
---
Map awarness and over all awareness of were your team is and were your enemies are. Who are on respawn and were is it best to move when you respawn. 
---
Be aware of your role and what you are expected to do so that you get a better game play for your team.
---
And use your map to your advantage. Kite, use los, don't eat damage by face tanking, if you going low and about to go down do that were you have team mates. If they can not ress you and you will die, don't try to self ress it usually ends up with enemies bleeding you out and come back to make sure you wont get up and it will be a endless struggling self ress that wont lead any were but to keep you from playing. Just bleed out and respawn.
---
If the toxic part would leave, the game would be deserted. Literally noone, isn't toxic.
---
I had a similar experience. GW2 has me spoiled with all the ambient dialogue and voiceovers. Even if there's simple text dialogue, it's of a reasonable length and often has some tasteful humor sprinkled in. It's fun just to trigger random dialogue to see what delight they've prepared this time.
---
FFXIV though was a snooze fest with all the text walls. I'm typically interested in game lore but in this case, trying FFXIV after GW2, I couldn't be bothered to stand still and read for 5 minutes, then walk over to another npc and do the same, and so on, and so forth. What an engaging way to serve lore. Full offense but this belongs in 2006 or so.
---
If you're going to complain to other players, the only thing they can do is tell you to take a break or try a different approach to the game.
---
They can't just create new content for you
---
So what happened to this community, just 2 weeks ago everyone was praising Anet like there was no tomorrow.
---
Your post started very open minded, embracing every type of player. Then you hit rock bottom by generalizing every raider into a toxic pile.
---
Anet brought raids into the game, people play them, people love them, Anet dissapoints with their release cadence, and with w7 with the severe lack of quality.
---
getting deeply involved in the leaf fossils.
---
story of WvW
---
"don't like gliders? adapt or quit then"
---
"don't like mounts? adapt or quit then"
---
ok.
---
[deleted]
---
Most players have no idea who those guilds are. IF they SC it's as an alternative to Metabattle.
---
Its like saying WoW died when a bunch of guilds dissolved after run Naxx (the first one).
---
The bubble burst. Or the forum faction left reddit.
---
I have a setup using mainly sinister and grieving with  balathazar runes and very few vipers with smoldering sigil to go above Condi duration cap. How bad will this be compared to the meta build?
---
if you group yourself with another toon that is level 80, your low-level toon  agrro mobs as much.  Doesnt matter if the high level tool is next to you or not.
---
My mouse can record movements and clicks so I made a simple bulk mystic forge clicker, click the first four item slots and combine in a macro, repeat. Mainly only for mystic clovers as it needs a tonne of clicks.
---
Why do people keep discussing this topic? GW2 doesnt have horizontal progression meaning there is no endgame  (Farming outfits does not count). Yeah of course the player base is going dry up eventually. "Hardcore" GW2 isnt a thing.
---
That's why I'd be excited for GW3 if they would simplify it down some (maybe have a little more 1 than 2). I think that is what excites some people about WoW Classic too.
---
I"ll share my experience here.
---
I saw The angry Joe review of this game and that made me buy this game. I was in college at The time, but even so put several hours in this game it was very social, light with none of that grind of corean mmos, or the elitism of Wow, people where friendly, and they where helpful, soon i was lvl 80 and did All the content i was happy. Then real life got in the way, and so i could not dedicate as much time as before ( Also New cool games got released) só i logged in sometimes it was still fun... 
---
Until the raids and in a small part the fractals, at first o thought cool New content, but it was not, i didnt (and still dont) have The time to put several hours repeating The same raid over and over, i mean i have a job and trying to get my masters, no way i'll get a online job. 
---
But that would be ok, but guess what, the comunity turned in to a light version of Wow. Want to do a raid its cool right? Well better get 100+ raid boss kills, have The equipment i Want and let my outside program get in to the games files só i can read your every move. "Want to have fun too bad nub, this content is for The hardcore".
---
I go to LFG and All i see is afk accounts people selling raid kills ( clearly showing how patetic this sistema have become) in the rare ocasion i see a real group forming i get kicked on the spot for being a necro (Yes thats a thing i guess) or after they realise i didint min/max.
---
I see The point of "Well is endgame content" thats not The point, The comunity is the problem. There are not alot of people willing to help you get in this content, and the game/anet dont Care, so good luck.
---
The game is not as fun anymore, i come back time to time tô check out LW, ou expansion but thats it, in time not even...
---
I know i could try to find a guild somewhere that could help me, but even that is a job for Then with strict schedules and such and i dont have the patience for that anymore.
---
Fact is New games are comming out every Day, and i dont have to spend weeks to have fun in raids when i could get to steam right now and have fun. 
---
Fact is as most "hardcore" gamers say "if you dont like it, dont play it" Well so i did, as did my money.
---
Umm you could probably extract the model files, but that would require a lot of work and a copy of the .dat file
---
I'm on the longest break from GW2 I've ever taken in ~5 years. Combination of not a lot going on in GW2, lots going on in Warframe, and soon a flood of games i want to play on Switch (starting this Friday with Fire Emblem).
---
Next content patch I'll be back though, for sure.
---
The last part isn't accurate.
---
Community doesn't care. Most aren't on here, or twitch.
---
I went to go play Destiny 2 till they hire a new balance team, it goes F2P in september so that should tide you over the 9 months or so till wing 8 is released.
---
I was the best warrior the world's ever seen and then I got bored because doing same shit over and over every week is boring as shit.
---
Nice helpful community 😀
---
About fuckin time if you ask me. For YEARS it's been the complete opposite. Finally we are awake.
---
Wow, I must have really gotten under your skin yesterday. See what happens in 3 to 6 months. It's not the first time we've heard this...it won't be the last.
---
Did I say, I'm not? But if you read through this thread you will agree: The most toxic comments are those who oppose the post of OP not the other way around.
---
And downvoting my comment just tells me I'm right, because ppl seem to not be able to handle the truth about their personality flaws.
---
&gt; Ah yes. There has never been people complaining that enemies in the story were too difficult. Nope. My imagination :P
---
of course the "hardcore" players complain about that when they step out of raids and get melted by the first veteran enemy they encounter because they're trying to facetank while standing in multiple AoEs and whining about not getting support instead of dodging.
---
I dont disagree? but all mmos are smaller bite sized content updates between expansions. And imo pof wasnt a severe improvement, the only thing that they did better was not have a 9 months drought directly afterwards.
---
It's either that, or they disagree with you calling the whole community toxic, while it in many peoples opinion isn't so they downvote you. 
---
I also disagree with you but in my opinion just making a point isnt worth beeing downvoted under any circumstance. (except for harassment, racism stuff like that).
---
The fact the GW2 is almost to the age that GW1 was when it was released speaks volumes. After seven years, a lot of us have done most of the end game content and are ready for whatever is next. However there is no next yet. The dry spells between expansions also were tough to weather. That being said, I don't plan on going anywhere. I'll make more legendaries and work toward my realm avenger title.
---
Most of the content being released in the latest season wasn't really "Oh, you find this thing fun? Well then play it all you want!" It was more along the lines of "Do you like doing this thing? Well, it doesn't matter. If you want a specific achievement, skin, etc you'll need to spend a lot of time on it."
---
Meanwhile new games are always coming out. I can spend 100 hours in GW2 getting another shitty glove skin and 10 AP or I can play an entire fucking game like Breath of the Wild.
---
I've soft quitted for a while now. Only logged on for personal story steps or expansion releases.
---
I need a community to get be drawn in, and I've never found that. I also don't have the interest to find one. So it's a cycle of never getting too attached.
---
I find the combat isn't quite where I'd like it. I find the dodge roll system clunky, but maybe I should just keybind it.
---
I'm never a fan of critical weapon swapping as a rotation. I'd rather swap weapons to be flexible, rather than it being part of the skill priority list.
---
I've been reading your comments for years. You. Are. A. Complete. Idiot.
---
If you do the math in rough number and assuming sleep time of 7 hours, you get than you need to spend more than half of the available time playing, essentially leaving no time for other activities, like work. This is not healthy and do not try to make it sound like it is.
---
The gcd is completely fine, I find the PVE content / combat muchhh funner and faster and more involved than GW2 at endgame. Agree about the pvp though, only thing I really miss from gw
---
With "hardcore" being defined by players who play a game many, many hours constantly, there is no single book series, TV show, movie, or game (with a couple of exceptions like chess) that can put out enough new content.  Simply put, consumers consume faster than producers can produce in these areas.
---
So does everyone reread their same book series or rewatch their one favorite TV show all the time and then complain about their being no new content?  Most normal people instead have multiple TV shows they enjoy, books to read, and hobbies to enjoy.  After they binge their TV show, they find another TV show.  And many, many people watch multiple shows at the same time.
---
So personally, I recommend these kinds of "hardcore" players to not quit GW2, but instead play multiple MMOs (and other games) at the same time.  Or if they are of the personality to binge, then binge and rotate amongst their games.
---
Of course, there are many "hardcore" players who never get bored and are happily playing GW2.  So this obviously only applies to certain kinds of players.  
---
Also, "hardcore" being defined by just playing a game a lot is just one definition of the term "hardcore" and not the one I would use.  
---
There are also people who do nothing but follow crowd and will quit or play just based on that mainly.
---
There are also many other cases like those who do nothing but SPvP and find that SPvP is not for them in GW2 and find other games.  Lots of cases why someone might quit (including another game releasing expansion) temporarily or longer and lots of reasons why people continue playing.
---
The big point is if you're happy with GW2, great!.  Continue playing.  If not, first make sure you really explored the game in all its many facets and examine yourself to see why you really aren't happy.  Is it boredom or something else?  
---
Then based on what you discover, either play GW2 with a new mindset, or play more games (and other hobbies) besides GW2 or just take a break completely from GW2 and come back later and see how you feel.
---
If there is a specific issue where GW2 can make improvement, great, make a specific thread about that where concrete realistic suggestions are offered.
---
I think I mistakenly saw 250 when I was checking the recipe for gift of mastery and thanks for the correction. 
---
How about farming spirit shards?
---
I'm not hardcore at all, but I am longtime and consistent. I can barely manage to login to my 3 accounts to claim daily rewards right now. Having absolutely no idea what is coming has diminished any excitement I have for the game. Especially seeing GaThEr WiTh CuTiE DrAgOn! every time I log in. I keep asking if GW2 is the game for me anymore. 
---
However I'm loving all the time in spending in GW1 at the moment.
---
I can only guess but its because expacs are paid content and anet is kinda big on free stuff and not being left behind.
---
I don't get whats the big fucking deal. Their release schedule has been new episodes about every 3 months, with new fractals and raids every 6 months. As as well as Festivals and events sprinkled in between. 
---
We know they had massive layoffs that affected the company and slowed production down. We know that the remaining staff from their other projects were moved back to GW2. 
---
Anet said they're going straight into S5 with a new schedule and new methodology for releasing content and that they're working on more QoL things like legendary runes and sigils as well as build templates. 
---
There's no big fucking mystery to solve.
---
I too love being gently put to sleep by ffxiv's combat.
---
Which is why I pointed out that its entirely possible, and more probable, if they don’t have to work a full time job. At which point you spend half your time playing games, and half doing other stuff. If they work a full time job then I agree it’s not healthy
---
Stop making shit up....
---
Happy Cake Day Zosin! If I had a flower for every time I thought of you...I could walk through my garden forever.
---
WvW content is garbage tho - litterally no reward structure and the best way to make profit there is to afk and kill a player every 10min.
---
I am not kidding here, look up Pip gain and WvW claim ticket aquisition! If you want to farm these ***unique*** WvW rewards your most educated decision is to go afk.
---
If you want to farm gold its better to farm anything in PvE!
---
But yeah they need to make raid CMs repeatable and also add rewards for a longterm progression!
---
Lack of new content killed gw2 for me. The expansions never had a bunch of new fractals/raids so i was left with content I've done thousands of times
---
Why is there a large mix of viper/grieving/sinister?  Is it just maximizing condition damage while adding ferocity to take advantage of the symbol buff?
---
Other projects running on the background is necessary for a company to keep on keeping.
---
PvP does not mnake you 'absurd' amounts of gold.
---
So have them use pseudonyms.  I don't need to know exactly who's doing what nor will I able to track them back to their social media accounts.  It works great for customer service and the various agents under Dornsinger why not for AMAs too?
---
Thanks so much!
---
DD can't give themselves vigor for more wack dodging so I'm inclined to agree
---
Yeah you could teleport gun through it during those invasions and stand inside safely.
---
&gt; They're still being way more communicative now than they were before the layoffs. Case in point: They have stuck to showing us balance patch before the day of the patch itself.
---
This is not good communication its just a way of appearing to communicate without really doing it. Its no different to patch notes its just earlier to smooth out any criticisms.
---
By the time [I reached this point](https://imgur.com/a/fiwjbWm) I was already tilted by the sheer amount of cutscenes and I closed the game 5 minutes later because I am literally not allowed to play it.

&gt; If you enjoy the game play the damn game
---
I enjoy the game. But this is an MMO which requires other players. There wasn't enough people to do Justiciar or Bloodstone Maw in all my attempts the past few days. (I even tagged up with a green commander tag for contrast against the red map.)
---
good bot. he needs all the encouragement he can get after losing his favorite power dps build and completely failing at doing anything as holo except smacking a few AFKers in PvP.

Wing 7 took 9 months.

You know I played ARR and a bit of Heavensward and have to say it was a really well put together game. I really liked my black mage.   The lack of pvp is something that I understand the game doesnt do and the games community is cool with.  But I do like casually doing battlegrounds and such and the game couldnt really offer that. when I played it could take an hour or more easily to get into a frontline.  I think it was a great game but I felt I missed pvp a little too much to have it be my main mmo.
---
I really don't think GW2 has that good of combat. It's very floaty, and there's _tons_ of dodge/evasion spamming. Iframes mixed with latency is a strange combination, and it's not one I enjoy.
---
I'm sure I'm speaking to the wrong crowd, though, since I'm in a /r/guildwars2 subreddit. So it goes. All I know is all of my GW1 friends tried GW2 and quit, and in every single case it was because they didn't enjoy the combat. I still enjoy the story, so I'm subbed here to watch for new updates &amp; release dates.
---
&gt; Same as since launch.
---
The game was almost *never* been this way except once: the SAB or RIOT incident when people were waiting over half a year for LS3, before it was even announced. 
---
Don't disregard people's criticisms as "just the usual".
---
Yes, I'm aware of how it looks. However, armor sets are so "samey" that even within it's armor class, silhouettes looks very, very similar.
---
That was never an issue in the other game.
---
Every time I think of how amazing Guild Wars 2 was at launch I feel sad. 
---
It was so much better. 
---
* Actual communities and servers which made playing content more fun (I remember loving to run orr trains, LS1, WvW, etc with the server community and actually getting know to people in an MMO)
---
* No excessive gem store bs (can't stress this enough, ArenaNET's monetization of this game is disgusting and a core issue).
---
* No seizure inducing characters and only legendaries really had flashy effects with made sense
---
* Less overpowered characters that can give max boons by existing meant people actually used team mechanics like stealth, fields and blasts to play dungeons (which actually had strategies based around movement and not just fights like fractals and raids). 
---
* Rewarding achievements, dailies and monthlies made logging on and getting started fun and not a chore.,
---
* No repeating hearts so you could actually feel like a completionist
---
* Karma and skill shards actually meant something, the economy was reasonably balanced...
---
I wish I could play it. It's kind of sad, I understand how WoW Classic fans feel. It's not nostalgia, it's just a worse game today than it used to be. I can still log on to Guild Wars 1 today and it feels like the game I liked back then (except I miss Ursan cheese of course), but I can't log on to Guild Wars 2 and see the game I used to like. I'm not saying nothing has improved, that would be lying, and they have made some good content, but the game doesn't have the feel it used to have. 
---
This game has lost its soul somewhere along the way.
---
If you think so, I know I'm doing something right. Thanks for the support. :)
---
Maybe if ANet actually fixed their game and released some xpacs it wouldn't be a meme
---
Try Warframe.  
---
**Less** grind(somewhat shockingly), better community.
---
[Dunno man I think problems are elsewhere in WvW!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cgjrfy/if_you_dont_like_it_just_play_something_else/euidhld?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Its just not worth actively spending time there if you could farm Gold in PvE.
---
If you need the currency or track progression you /afk with Participation-/Birthday Boosters in a map with outnumbered buff.
---
You really must like PvP and the imbalaced WvW PvP on top of that to sink your time into this gamemode.
---
Also you need special equipment like Marauder Set with Durability Rune or some other Celestiel bullshit wich is a huge goldsink to start your career in WvW. It'd be great if you could buy exotics with those Stats in WvW and not bullshit Berserker Set. The additional Problem is the net worth of Exotic Marauder Set compared to Ascended, its way more efficient to go for an Ascended Set but thats even more of a goldsink.
---
So you need special equipment for a gamemode that does not pay for that Set in the slightest. So you go into huge debt for a long time until you make enough money in WvW. You see in Fractal T4s you make about 50-60g a day and therefore pay for your Berserker set in about a week max.
---
You are wrong honestly. Ff14 is the story players utopia, its far from the raid hardcore paradise you make it out to be. 
---
But ill enterain the idea, you say they are the raiders utopia, what makes it so? Well if we look at ff14 the release 8 mans which are like 4 bosses a wing every idk? 7 months? Then they have easier 20 or 24 mans idk and the some ultimates. The 20-24mans are rather easy and not what a hardcore raider would play for so we exclude them. Whats left are the ultimates which unless im mistaken ff14 doesnt get more than 1 per year  and 8 mans which again are 4 bosses long and come out every idk 7 months or so?
---
Lets compaire that to wow, in a similar time frame  wow pukes out tiers that can have from 8 to 13 bosses (rarely 13) every, 7 or so months i want to say? They all have 4 dificulties going from easy to extremely hard.  So tell me why is ff14 the raiders paradise? Is it because the raids are well designed and fun? No that called being good at your job as an encounter designer, is it the (in my understanding) consistent schedule of release? No thats called having some decency.
---
Meanwhile im hearing left and right how amazingly good ff14 story is and how shadowbringers not only is one of the best ff stories we've seen in years but also rivals story based games outside the mmo space.
---
Also for comment on team sizes, do you have a source detailing their team size, i heard its quite a small one and that the reason raiding conten is as scares is because they dont have the man power to muster any more raids per year.
---
Same here i left it ine year ago after playing a couple hours thinking it was boring. Really gave it another chance and I think thst after level 20 i kinda undertood there was more to it. At 30 no longer did I felt like there was a GCD. Enjoying it a lot. Story is cool too
---
They do advertise just in horrible shitty ways that dont matter/make sense, like the twitter-sphere and partnering to make Yoga pants.. for some odd reason they think that i f  someone who never played video games hears about them it may be the magical gateway to getting them to become a gamer~ lol
---
&gt; You never need to make or buy armor again
---
laughs in chrono
---
Seriously, why are there so few beard options and they all look horrible?
---
It's designed to be a gamers first mmo. If it's not,  the babying at the beginning is painful
---
the game is definitely tanking, if anet doesn't have something other than season 5 up their sleeve this game will be on maintenance mode soon. it's the content drought, the quality, or lack thereof, of the content that we did get, the lack of communication from anet and a loss of hope for the games future. well known figures in the community such as teapot leaving are just a symptom, not the problem itself. you won't find many honest answers on this sub but sadly it's the truth.
---
Most of the praises come from people who came back after a break to do new map/skyscale or newbies who just picked up the game and have overwhelming content and everything is new and exciting.
---
For veterans what we got was a good map/episode,lots and lots of timegating then an easy af raid that got completed within a few hours and CM's done within the same day, then we got a big balance patch that rekt chrono in all modes and pretty much destroyed holo in PvE. PvP is in the worst state ever...wvw alliances will come in 10 years i guess.... Meanwhile the gem store gets updated daily with new skins as if the whole dev team is just focusing on microtransactions and there's no word for ACTUAL content on the horizon.  
---
Oh yeah we got dragon bash which is just plain boring and more weeks of meta/world boss train events which is basically a copy/pasta to keep people playing...... Again no actual content. Anet indeed released a lot of content but none of it was repeatable or at least worth repeating. 
---
All that remains is to watch ERP which is gonna be the biggest GW2 event so far which probably anet won't support as they choke at the word "elitist". Truly oblivious.
---
Did you really just "do your research" me?
---
Hahahahaha
---
I did this before, I forgot how... But I wish you luck. Its def do-able.
---
it's a combination of everything that you mentioned but we've been dealing with imbalance and lack of rewards for years but we enjoy the game mode so we stayed. but you tack on gliders and mounts and that's the last straw that convinces me to move to a diff game.
---
I used to consider myself on the border of hardcore but these days I’m a super casual and barely play unless there’s a new story patch. When there is a patch I just play the couple hours to finish and log off until the next one. Maybe it’s burnout from the thousands of hours I’ve put in over the years or maybe just the lack of motivating content.
---
[Sonny, I'm proud of you.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cghtii/is_guild_wars_2_the_current_meme_right_now/euhkvae/)
---
It seems my original post has been validated.
---
i hope you know that there is something in between and even hardcore players are playing and enjoying the new maps and story.  
---
there is simply a great unbalance between all the story and map updates while all other gamemodes are getting less and less attention over the years without really being heard.  
---
imagine they would just recyle any story they bring out and include a additional challenge mode into every bossfight. suddenly it wouldn't look as grim as is does for people who want to be challenged.  
---
if players want "easy mode" or "storymode" raids, the whole thing can also be backwards tbh. the whole game should be more challenging everywhere again. all those nerfs to hero points to make them brainless instead of having those terrifing champions in HoT for example was a really bad move.
---
The majority of the player base plays it for the LS/Open world, thinking that hardcore content is what the game needs will not do any favors as only a tiny part of the playerbase even cares about those things. You're making a lot of assumptions that no one wants LS/Open world when in reality, raids and more hardcore content are the least played game types of every single MMO. Hardcore content doesn't bring in the money.
---
There's several niche farms floating around, but they require a level of organization that, in general, posts like these aren't usually looking for. So, I like to recommend what I see as the three best easy, low-effort farms: Silverwastes, Dragonfall, and meta-event farms.
---
Silverwastes is the oldest. The basic gist is you check LFG for a map doing "RIBA" rotation. The general theory here is that you rotate between the four forts in the order given by the acronym (red, indigo, blue, amber). First rotation, everyone follows the commander, then splits up, but continuing the same general order. Ideally, there's enough people on the map doing staggered rotations so that none of the forts fall. You want to be going around and tagging as many events as possible, being sure to save all your bags of gear and champ bags. Use the shovels you earn to dig up chests as well. Eventually, the meta will progress to the "breach" phase, where you need to kill a champ at each fort, then finally the Vinewrath. After the Vinewrath, the map will have a short break, where you either use shovels to dig up bandit chests, or head to the labyrinth to open nightmare chests. Then you do the rotation all over again, when the meta restarts. When you're done farming, transfer all the bags to a character between level 49 and 53, and open, salvage the gear, and sell the mats.
---
Dragonfall works similarly, where you run around trying to tag as many events as possible. Except instead of looking for bags, you're after keys. Once all three camps are built up, the meta will progress to the next stage. Complete this, and you get the final champ run. Follow the commander, as there's a specific route you can take to get all the post-meta champs in one run. Mistborn coffers will spawn at the end of the main meta, and when you kill each champ, as well as during a few of the first phase events. Use the keys you got in the first phase to open these. Consume the Mistborn motes for VM, use the VM to buy trophy shipments from the vendor, and sell the trophies. Like Silverwastes, you can save the champ bags to open on a level 50 character, but it's less important to this farm than it is for Silverwastes. With unid gear, either sell directly on TP, or ID and salvage. Never salvage directly. Once you've opened ~150 chests, it gets a lot less profitable (as they no longer drop rare unid gear) so be aware of that.
---
Finally, the meta event train sees you going to the various HoT and PoF metas, to get the "Hero Choice Chests" that they give daily. These chests get you an amalgamated gemstone. You can get 8 per day, and it takes about an hour and a half to do the whole circuit, give or take. Sell the gemstones (or keep 'em, if you want a gen 2 legendary) and whatever else you get. This is a once per day farm though, so you can't marathon it.
---
There's some variance involved (especially in the meta train, where there's a lot of variables that can lower your profits), but in general, you can expect to earn roughly 18-20 gold per hour on average, once you get the hang of them.
---
Other good, relatively simple sources of gold: dailies (2 gold), daily Tequatl (two gold, plus some other stuff, and a chance for ascended weapons), T4 fractal dailies, (20-30 gold per day, but takes awhile to get to where you can do them), node farms (flax, rich iron, and elder wood, plus home instance. Be sure to use VM harvesting tools for max profit), and daily ascended mat crafting (craft the time-gated materials and sell).
---
The issue here is that for "hardcore" players, the game gives them maybe 50 hours of substance a year.  
---
Whereas other games can achieve much greater amounts because they do a better job with replayability. With interesting incentives, long-term goals, and content that features high level of mastery, you can easily make an 1 hour experience remain interesting for 20+ hours.  
---
But GW2 lacks any of that. There are few interesting rewards to go after since everything is being shoved into the gemstore, there are few long-term goals that focus around new content, and outside of fractals and raids the content is leisurely.  
---
The typical update involves spending an hour on the story, 3 hours exploring the new map, and then you're left without anything interesting to do or go after.  
---
There's just very little reason to stick around the game, which doesn't go over well for the type of player who wants to become invested.
---
There is a difference between casuals and lazy people.
---
GW2 is filled with not only casualy but a lot of nasty lazy bunch of folks.
---
Would you consider someone who only plays 1 hour daily casual? Yeah sure me2!
---
But in GW2 one hour should be plenty to clear your daily CMs + T4! So even casuals can do that.
---
Fractals pay 50-60g a day so the most casual players who only play one hour a day can get the Griffon within a week or so... \~7 hours playtime ofer the course of few days.
---
Its those nasty lazy players that are not willing to spend time to read guides and get equipment who cry like bitches for attention. Sadly GW2 and this subreddit is infested with not casuals but lazy gamers.
---
Please differentiate casuals are not the desease that kills GW2.
---
And then have to pay $5 to change your hair style!
---
[My request has been fulfilled.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cghtii/is_guild_wars_2_the_current_meme_right_now/euhkvae/)
---
Will the final paper be released somewhere online? I'm curious
---
Lately I’ve been playing GW1 again a lot, the reason being repeatable endgame content. I love the team building aspect of GW1 and the large world of expansive lore with actually difficult content that can be played solo and repeated.
---
I did that for a few weeks and then Anet released the shrine jackal skin. Fastest gold to gem I have ever done.
---
It’s possible that guild wars 2 was only meant to be played for ~14000 hours tops and then there’s just not
---
much left to do. While Tpot played every game mode there really isn’t a lot of repeatable engaging stuff other than grinding the pvp ladder every season.
---
I miss the mastery based hero points too.
---
It was not "confirmed" that they've moved on - that's like saying Blizzard has "moved on" from WoW despite that they just had their own round of layoffs. Restructuring is normal, especially when consumer patterns change. I love a few of the people that were let go, but they were mostly long-term employees who were probably earning more than average, and tbh sometimes it's better to get fresh perspectives into those roles. 
---
Further, we just finished the last episode of LS4 (May) with a new raid wing (June) and the resurrection of the Dragon Bash (July) event... so I wouldn't say we're in a drought yet, seeing as we've had content every month for the last three months 🙄. We will be, considering the time it takes to develop LS episodes, but let's not pretend every other title doesn't experience the same thing between releases. We're getting LS5, and then likely another expansion (considering GW2 is one of NCSofts best performers in NA/EU). No dev is going to announce an expac when it's still being developed (i.e. when things are subject to change).
---
Calling someone out in a Raid / Fractal for low performance and then removing them from the team is not toxic its just normal.
---
We all know those leeches we had in presentations or projects during school, who don't contribute to the goal but still get the reward because you need to work with them anyways?
---
Well here online we can get rid of those guys.
---
Ignore a sunk cost! That's like, rule 1
---
longbow builds are really similar. you just take lead the wind in marksmanship instead.
---
Improved rewards for repeating raid cms would be a good and simple start.
---
Why would NCSoft kill one of the games actually bringing in revenue? It's not like CoH.
---
“Fractals and Raids every *6* months”
---
Dude I wish
---
So, "the same thing as the wardrobe, just with more variations to choose from."
---
My biggest issue is the constant balance updates that needlessly change core mechanics and skills. I come back after a few months and it feels like every profession has changed.
---
Yep, the downvotes do a pretty good job of proving my point.
---
But how does one ignore themselves?
---
What is someone to you who logs in once per week and does his raid fullclear in 4 hours?
---
Casualcore?
---
What designer thought a 2.5s GCD was a good idea though?
---
Tea.
---
Honestly when I first started playing gw2 I thought it was interesting how it focused on horizontal progression and I could focus on different "endgame"....
---
Unfortunately, that translates into a game that is mediocre for all and a master of none. You quickly blast through content every update (which is single player oriented for some reason) and then you putz around doing dynamic events that offer you meaningless rewards.
---
Seriously, there are only a handful events actually WORTH doing in the game and even then it mostly just translates into you getting more mats because God forbid you actually give your players cosmetics or better gear that isn't crafted.
---
As time goes on, gw2 has become this strangely shallow game where you just repeat the same shit every day, getting lootbox after lootbox full of mats that you don't rlly give a shit about until you can finally craft your legendaries that are incrementally better since the world scales with you.
---
This sub hates the wow gear treadmill, but the twist is that gw2 actually has a worse treadmill where you spend hours grinding for literally no reason. Atleast in WoW, you actually have a reason to grind for gear since you know a new raid (that continues the main story and lore) will be released in the future.
---
Or just pop the Infinite Hair makeover. For those that didnt have it, you could use the hair makeover kit you get free by playing the game... Seriously, any players that play a bit of GW2 would have enough Total makeover kit and transmutation charges without needing to buy them from the gems store.
---
Yea I’m excited for role queue in OW too. I haven’t played comp in a few seasons other than placing for gold weaps. Was high masters when I stopped.
---
Do you want to play a dead game?
---
Most content creators are endgame players and its really fun if those guys or their team- / guild- / premates leave. You can extrapolate interest in your game based on active users on third party platforms such as reddit and twitch etc.
---
If you want the game to continue and do great then you want public attention!
---
Look at GW2 interest ... its goddamn low.
---
You fight him back with sense, and honestly claiming the sky is falling when we've had updates every month for the last several months is stupid. But the playerbase is often stupid and fickle - they've claimed this game was going to die since before HoT. Because unfortunately, even as one part of the playerbase gains some understanding and builds logical expectations, there are always new players coming in who have no fucking idea what they're talking about - for instance, not understanding that a dev will not talk about something in active development, because those things can change and the playerbase starts howling about how they "were lied to" when something changes (as is the nature of development). 
---
They've said we have a new season of living story coming, and considering that GW2 is still profitable, we'll likely get another expansion. But expansions take time, so it's obviously not going to happen until after LS5 ramps up to it. Mind you, this is the game that said they weren't going to make expansions for the first 2-3 years after launch - and literally no one believed me when I said we were absolutely going to get one. 
---
Drought happens in every franchise, because good content takes time. It is not the end of the world when people dabble in other games in the interim, especially seeing as GW2 is still rated higher in player satisfaction than most of them (and I'm pretty confident in that assessment, because I've played them literally all of them).
---
I guess if NCSoft doesn't give a shit about losing money.
---
It's pretty easy, especially if you just follow the order of the skills and numpad. 1 is 1, 2 is 2 etc. Your muscle memory will develop pretty quickly and your hand remembers what skills are where. It's much better in WoW where you can actually re-position your skills and action bar in the shape of the actual thumb pad, so when you look at the screen your skills are positioned in the shape of the buttons your thumb is resting on. Thats how I learned to get used to it.
---
I've more or less quit GW2 at this point in favor of FF14. The PvP in GW2 is amazing but the absolute lack of new features and laughably bad balancing directions made me want to stop playing PvP entirely. The big issue for me is how much better FF14 is than GW2  in every single way *other* than PvP, so if ANet doesn't care about the PvP then I'm just playing FF14.
---
If he hasn't opened the box, the skin won't be unlocked.
---
Only so many times you can say the exact same thing I'm saying before I have to wonder about your reading comprehension...
---
Yeah, I can'y play MMOs without one at all. I've never been a keyboard skill presser. I don't use the mouse buttons to move so I have no idea how I would be able to use WASD to move AND 1234567 for skills. I've got some mapped to QERF around WASD but tats like weapon swap, ultimate ability, interact and run toggle.
---
3 separate accounts sounds pretty damn hardcore
---
[removed]
---
&gt; . . . just like GW2? You can't do all of the content in HoT, PoF, or any of the living stories save the 1st without doing the attached story missions. Hell, in FFXIV you have the option of skipping the story.
---
I literally transferred one of my alt accounts to EU that had less than 300AP just to play with a friend who has been playing for 3 months and I had zero problems playing the content with him. I could boost that character to 80 and I would still be able to play everything with him. It would be hard for sure, but still doable. You can even kill Xera or run Dragon's Stand with 0 Mastery points because GW2 gives you that freedom.  
---
In FFXIV the dungeons, raids, some systems and other stuff(80% of the content maybe?) are all locked behind the main and secondary quests, so there is no way to play that content without doing these quests. Everything is locked behind so many quests, and can you guess why? Because you can pay 25USD to skip it :)
---
Highly recommend slay the spire. It's so addictive
---
Hello,
---
There's a sound I keep hearing whenever I'm in the PvP lobby. Someone's character makes a sound like a trumpet or bugle. It's very short and always the same notes so it's probably not a musical instrument from the gem store.
---
I wish I could explain it better, just curious if anyone knows what I'm talking about and can explain what makes the sound.
---
Thanks!
---
I just want more fucking variety with the male character models. I hate being forced to play a fucking Arnold Schwarz if I want to play a male Norn.
---
I guess the same principle goes for NA too.
---
Just pick a meta support build and open your own LFM if in doubt, usually supports are more sought after than dps players since there are way too many damage dealer in this game than supporters given the fact that only certain specs can support wich need specialized equiment whereas damage dealer can mostly swap around their equipment and still be fine (berserker or viper).
---
I guess even in NA you can find groups fast if you go for meta comps!
---
What does that even have to do with what I said? Literally nothing. In fact I’d even go as far as to say that what you’re saying applies more to games like WoW and FFXIV which have pretty poor mechanics when it comes to overworld cooperation and in some cases force you to do content solo. I’ve found that in GW2 I’ve interacted with more random players and partied up to clear things together than I have in pretty much any modern MMO.
---
The bottom line is I’m not saying that GW2 is the best MMO when it comes to party play, but right now it’s pretty much the only MMO giant right now that **doesn’t** feel like a single player experience, most MMOs on the market, especially the big ones, have 100% failed at making their experience feel like a multiplayer experience, instead of a single player experience with a chat box. Things weren’t always like this, for the MMO genre so it sucks that things have for the most part gone in that direction.
---
GW2 is by no means the best MMO ever in the history of MMOs, but the one thing it’s definitely got on other games on the market at the moment, is that it definitely encourages social behavior.
---
LS updates are covered by most MMO outlets, actually. 
---
FFXIV puts out expansions every 2 years, too (starting in 2015, 4 years after the 2.0 release following the massively negative response to the initial launch in 2010). But they don't have episodic updates in between, from what I understand. 
---
World of Warcraft drops expansions every 2 years, without story updates. 
---
ESO drops once a year, but they're not as big/in-depth in my opinion. 
---
HoT dropped in 2015. PoF dropped in 2017. They underwent a shift in dev priorities and restructuring, meaning we get another year of LS, putting us at a 2020-2021 release date for the next expansion. That's not the end of the world, nor the end of GW2.
---
Because ad campaigns cost money with questionable efficacy, and at the end of the day, word of mouth (social media, etc.) and targeted outlets are more effective than seeing yet another cheesy banner ad on a site that's likely already talking about the game anyway.
---
&gt; World Bosses resulted in their biggest active players number. 
---
Source? They never release player numbers so I'm really curious where you are pulling that from.
---
People aren't doing world bosses for the content. World bosses are one of the thing in this game that has aged the worst over the years. The fights are completely uninteresting. They are doing it for the 1 bonus reward chest at the end.
---
This isn't gonna keep players engaged in the long run. You need your content to be repayable and currently they are failing to provide it for their players. Slapping a temporary reward on shitty content isn't a replacement for good content.
---
I started ff14....
---
And ye..
---
Leveling is cruel in that... Quests are the most standard and generic ones I met in a mmo so far...
---
But the bosses in dungeons and raids are nice so far...
---
The 100 quests at 50 were fucking tedious and made me close to 3x quit.
---
Iam atm in storm blood and again close to quit again cause it feels like I do allways the same...
---
And I honestly don't know how grindy it will be to get a second class up.
---
Also many mechanics specially ui wise are over complicated for no reason other than the engine is too old and at its limits (devs wording).
---
Also... Retainers gold monthly, store, app costs monthly.... On top of a sub.
---
But I'll try to fight myself into end game and see there but I catch myself playing each day less and less ff14.
---
I usually have no problem with those kind of stuff, as long as the combat is fun. It's a good way to get to know the backstory and the game. But yeah, that combined with super slow combat system is just tedious. Specially for new players who came from BDO, AA, GW2.
---
So much this. It sickens me to make a male Norn cause they all invariably end up being carbon copies of Brick from the  Borderlands franchise. I'd rather make a max height male Human and pretend it's a Norn.
---
I think it was mentioned somewhere that eventually the rest of the stone summits followed the rest of the dwarves into the depths.
---
Yeah Mounts fucking killed Roaming in WvW.
---
You need a build to get them of their Mounts and certain specs are totally fucked now, thats added imbalance.
---
I oneshotted a Memestrel Scrapper from his Mount with my Soulbeast Rapidfire before the Sic 'Em nerfes.
---
11k Mount hp and like 35k Scrapper hp **gone**!
---
*pewpewpew fucking huntarded*
---
You need to bring fullzerk build into roaming nowadays or you can't get fights anymore. Mounts killed smallscale alltogether!
---
Who listens to radio? Do you work in advertising? lol
---
Did you watch the video? The one that shows the cringey cosplay in a taxicab? And how it's obviously not an effective strategy? I think you missed Axlos' sarcasm. 
---
Targeted advertising is more effective, and MMO advertising works best through content creator partners (i.e., twitch streams, youtube) and industry-related sites.
---
every time i see people say they are leaving for FF I get super confused.  And think its all a joke.  
---
Did they make and release a new ff mmo within the past few years?  
---
Cus I tried to get into that old shitty one multiple times.  It is a graphical mess and gameplaywise a total grindfest.  I also tried to play it on PS4, because it seemed like one of the best mmos on the console.  
---
Nope, still garbage.  
---
Its ok if you want a character with cat ears and a tail, but don't want to look like an actual animal like the charr.  And I guess with the over the top gemstore items from koreanet in GW2 that kind of cutesy anime nonsense is the direction we are going in.  Might as well go to FF to get it early.
---
Happening with Warframe too
---
My sweet summer child, those are cardboard cutouts, and you will soon see why
---
&gt;Guild Wars doesn't have that - maybe new elite specs or stat combos will powercreep a bit, but ultimately player power doesn't reliably go up
---
This is a huge understatement
---
And your comment sums up exactly why they won't talk about future content until it's almost finished - because everything in development is subject to change.
---
Yesterday. Ya missed it
---
MF affects the likelihood of you getting a green unid gear instead of a blue as the actual drop
---
It seems like you have no idea how effecient and min/max-ed gathering routes in gw2 are, and how frequently they're used for gold farming.
---
Wait. I’m not a summer child, sweet, nor am I playing FFXIV. What’s wrong with those things? Do you not think they’d help GW2?
---
I'm really surprised they didn't do this in the first place. Overall, the visuals for soulbeast feel lacking, even the stances. All the same shade of green, with the burst of leaves. The stance animal is only seen for a brief half-second, then you just have a green mist. 
---
Would love for at least the merged aura to reflect what type of pet you're merged with.
---
If they just recycled the design philosophy behind HoT with PoF it would have created issues for every map. By differentiating PoF from HoT, they served up two different styles of content instead of catering to one approach/playstyle. 
---
A lot of players complained about HoT being difficult to get through alone, and that they didn't want to have to group up and coordinate to play the game. They get PoF - where only a few of the metas need a ton of coordination. They can explore, kill shit, and participate in bounties without a super active map. HoT, in turn, still offers the metas and more challenging content for people who want the MMO experience - and by pursuing a different strategy in designing PoF, they didn't divide HoT populations past the point where content would be rendered unplayable (splitting the population). 
---
So HoT is effectively still playable, enjoyable content 4 years after the fact - which generally would be considered successful game development.
---
never and nothing lol
---
uh oh, people started making that exact joke about anthem, look where anthem is now omegalul
---
Imo there is no such thing as quitting in Gw2. You can take a break and jump right in whenever you want and you wont lose any progress/still equal to your friends. They'll be back... ^^^wont ^^^they?
---
LS is literally just episodic updates between expansions, which were being issued at the standard cadence of the rest of the industry (2-3 years). I'm not sure how the bad outweighs the good, when all they do is keep the game lively between normal expansion development time, and build up anticipation for the upcoming expansion. 
---
You're literally complaining that they give us something to do, whereas most other titles don't between expansions - which take (usually) the same 2-3 years to develop. 
---
The game spent the first 2 1/2 years saying expansions wouldn't be happening, so the idea that "they should have stuck to expansions and dungeons back in 2013" when the first expansion didn't even drop until 2015 is... inaccurate to say the least.
---
he/she just wants to sound smart without actually being smart or saying anything to back it up. most, if not all of what manickitty mentioned have been staples for years in MMO's, those that have them and do it right tend to do well, those that don't, don't.
---
Which means they freed up capital by cutting long-term staff that likely had salaries that were higher than the industry standard.
---
That is why his comment
---
&gt;I for one won't stand waiting until these Devs wake up and stop building this game as a Casual only MMO.
---
really means
---
&gt;I, for one, won't stand for waiting until these Devs wake up and make a game that can literally keep me entertained while I forfeit the bulk of my waking hours to a fantasy world.
---
No wonder people are upset - they're expecting enough content to justify vacating their real lives for a digital universe every 2 years.
---
I'm actually a big fan of FFXIV's combat, it feels like what I always imagined a sequel to Guild Wars would feel like. My problem with FFXIV is the pacing of the MSQ. I find the absurd amount of fetch quests and obnoxiously long cutscenes/word boxes to be insufferable and those actually put me to sleep. My friends tell me it gets significantly better in the expansions, but I'm not sure I can reach that point.
---
Imagine raiding every day in 2019 lul
---
Yea, except they said they will support it and add a no downstate feature for the tourney then weeks later they back out for no reason making the whole thing a shitshow.
---
Iirc they said they were "considering" a competitive festival, but given the appearance of Dragon Bash which completes the festival calendar, I don't expect it to ever appear.
---
sounds like u couldnt reach 50
---
I'd love to see all those crying players to just leave game and reddit altogoether. You won't be missed.
---
Yeah because spending literally 10 seconds typing fuck you is taking soooooo much of my day.
---
Besides I have nothing of note to say to you. You've proven that logic goes completely wasted on you, all you deserve is fucking insults lol.
---
You can say that it doesn't bother you, but that's not how humans work. Enough people tell you you're an asshole and a moron and you're gonna start agreeing with them. So here's one more for the road! You are a brainless blight to this game.
---
I think the multiple playable races were a mistake. Just look at the race by playtime stats https://gw2efficiency.com/account/player-statistics
---
In what ways has the multiple playable races made the game better? 
---
Meanwhile armors have to made 5 times. Maybe we would have more if that wasn't the case. What about skill animations? We have stuff reused all over the place. Might there have been more variety if efforts didn't have to be spread out?
---
1) 4 bosses every 7 months is still a good bit more than the 3 bosses every 9-11 months GW2 has.
---
2) You are excluding extreme trials, which adds even more to the "bosses per year" count. They're also pretty fun, if easier. Along the same lines, why exclude alliance raids? We're not talking about ff14 hardcores, we're talking about gw2 hardcores turned ff14 newbies. The alliance raids may not be hard, but they're still bits of instanced content such a player would be interested in running at least once each.
---
3) The Ultimates go beyond just being one fight, it's like an entire raid wing condensed and concentrated into a single, long, gruelling encounter. And since the ultimates are totally outside gear progression, they'll always be there for the challenge and no other reason, even after umpteen new ones come out.
---
4) Most importantly, top ff14 raiders may only be interested in farming the latest savage tier and clearing ultimates, but the gw2 raiders turning to ff14 aren't there yet. We still have like 6 years of game to get through, don't discount the back catalogue. To a new ff14 player, all the old trials and raids are just as fresh and exciting as the current ones (ok, forget that cape westwind and steps of faith and bismarck exist). I'm aiming squarely at savages, but who cares how long it takes to get there? The endgame is always there waiting, so I plan on taking my time and experiencing Bahamut, and Alexander, and Omega, and Suzaku Ex, and Nidhogg Ex, and Shiva Ex, and Zurvan Ex, and Susano Ex, and you get the picture. 
---
5) You seem to have a bee in your bonnet about ffxiv getting praise for its raids over wow? FF14 doesn't need to be THE raiding utopia, it just needs to provide a fresh experience for the gw2 vets. Many gw2 refugees are in fact going to WoW, many have already been burned out of WoW too. For me, I just picked FF14 because it enticed me more than WoW. And I'm enjoying myself a lot. Will I match the 3k hours I clocked in gw2? Maybe. I don't really care though.
---
6) Going back to your opening statement, it sounds like you're implying being a raider's paradise and story fan's utopia are mutually exclusive. Lol.
---
Did they say festival or event?
---
What.
---
Do you know that you can right click stuff to open/salvage/use all?
---
afaik aar to hw is around 150-200h of pure cancer, tho that depends if you watch cutscenes, read dialogue of how some farmer lost a chicken lmao. game is fucking retarded till 60~ and it still is a chore, oh dont forget the grind of the same dung/trial for 50 times to get closer to next tier gear so you could actually try and do raiding later. i wonder how much % of their whole income is story/char skip stuff at shop.
---
Your community comment rings Really true with me. I’ve never felt like I had a real guild in GW2 like I had in GW1. I miss that. I miss my guild in Guild Wars 2.
---
It's not new, and a lot of random dialogue like that is undocumented. All of the ambient lines that play in Hero's Canton are from 2012, but they play at random, and from random ambient NPCs, on a long timer.
---
How is that relevant to what I said, dear boy?
---
&gt; Jade Quarry
---
JQ represent! since August 2012.
---
So you have nothing meaningful to contribute other tha random ramblings. Got it.
---
Post your Efficiency profile. I'm 90% confident you haven't played a quarter of the content out there/call a bunch of content "not content".
---
You get use it its like that in every game that has pvp. After a while it becomes something like the wind whistling in the background.
---
Well in the context of the OP, I think hardcore means like high end raiding/fractals, which I do when I'm interested but not a lot. I have an NA main account, an EU account with the expacs, and a King Fu Tea account for farming easy/profitable dailies. I'm invested in the game, usually, but right now... not really.
---
You have repeated the same thing numerous times in this thread. Repeatedly the point has eluded you. 
---
You quite possibly might be right another xpac is on the way, but there has been zero (literally none) indication they are doing another xpac. In fact the game director said after the release of PoF that it was unlikely GW2 gets another xpac, because “LS is working.” 
---
I do like where your heart is, but Anet has developed its cloud of uncertainty with its mishandling of the game and subsequent silence. Your speculation does nothing to remove that cloud.
---
You can filter them out but i would prefer if the raid lfg had a buy and sell section.
---
This? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUOps-hY4hM
---
here is the list of command lines.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments
---
my GW2 folder is 45G. 
---
Maybe shuffle some stuff on your main to make room then download and move it back?
---
Goodluck, you can always take the external disk to a friends GW2 and copy that....
---
Hey, for the record, I think you sound like the voice of reason against all the whining negativity over nothing. :') People were quite happy at the end of LS4, that's a fact, and people were quite happy that they ASKED for Dragon Bash, for more festivals to round out the year with and Anet DID listen and deliver that.....but people forget-----get a little fearmongering going on and they quickly forget. If LS5 sucks then I'm going to be yelling in here along with everyone else, and I'd be disappointed if they're not making an expac---but I'm actually happy with the content, and I'm happy that GW2 is an MMO that lets me go play other games in the meantime, and that's why it'll always be my main MMO.
---
(I am, in fact, trying out FFXIV. But it's because I'm curious and not because I'm jumping ship? There's room for more than one game in the universe.)
---
Yeah, people will say I'm whiteknighting, but I honestly feel that it's *nothing* and I'm a fucking wvwer, for god's sake.
---
would be nice.  some of us only do wvw
---
Let's hope not.
---
Is Holo still okay for story content? I just want to come back and finish PoF and season 4 for now. Considered making a new character but having to world complete again (just some stupid personal preference) is a bit daunting, especially since I have only unlocked Raptor. 
---
But on the other hand it’s a little hard to attach to a character you won’t be able to do harder content with &lt;.&lt;.
---
they really need to have players beta test their changes and give feedbacks
---
The entire community is passive aggressive in that weird fake nice way.
---
What fucking game are you playing i wanna play it. i gotta wait 5-10 minutes for a game just to get matched with the same people from last game and the balance is a shit hurricane.
---
No, not to corporations.
---
But don't you know that we don't matter. The health of a game is measured by the amounts of hardcores that play it. Casuals are just zombie NPCs that don't count.
---
No, I'm not kidding.
---
I want (but don't expect) an exclusive WvW map dedicated to the festival.
---
Hmm I was 30/30 and it unlocked automatically for me. For some people who weren't 30/30, even when they completed the master achievement and reached 30/30 it didn't unlock automatically, they had to go and talk to a Forge NPC (either the volatile magic one, or the weapons collections one) and buy an item for 5g that would unlock the Corsair Leggings achievement in the Visions of Thunderhead Peaks collection.  
---
It's a bit different in your case since you did already have all the achievements, but maybe you can check if this item is available for you and can unlock that part of the collection for you?
---
If not, another option might be to do the Thunderhead Peaks reward track in WvW or PvP to see if it unlocks anything I guess, although that'd be more annoying.  
---
If none of these options work, you could always write a ticket to the Anet support. 
---
Hopefully talking to a vendor will help you fix this !
---
You can use every class and almost every build for story content. You can do the same for most harder content, unless you want to PUG, in which case it will be a bit more difficult to convince other players to let you in. Considering the PUG scene is not especially healthy anyway, I'd suggest finding a guild or group of players to play with and not worry about these things as much.
---
Unless you're EA, most developers don't see their playerbase as walking cash dispensers. They don't measure a player's value based only on how much they spend in the cash shop.
---
Combat at cap is still easy compared to most MMOs. WoW is mechanically more challenging (often for the wrong reasons).
---
When this game dies it wont be missed.
---
I see, thanks. I think I’m going to stick to what I enjoy playing for now. And when the time comes, git gud and try to find a group :)
---
&gt;of course the "hardcore" players complain about that when they step out of raids and get melted by the first veteran enemy they encounter because they're trying to facetank while standing in multiple AoEs and whining about not getting support instead of dodging.
---
Is this a LARP?
---
do events, open all boxes bags, deposit, sell in tp at a markup.
---
1. Get a job
---
2. Buy gems
---
3. ...
---
4. Profit (?)
---
&gt; there isnt much more content than gw2 if we dont count gear grind
---
Is this a joke? I pretty much ran out of stuff to do outside of raiding within two months playing GW2 and the only thing there really was to do was farm the Silverwastes. GW2 is definitely a great game but it's by no means something that always has stuff for you to do.
---
In the first place it doesn't even sound like you played at endgame.
---
&gt; Also every sigle thing is locked behind quests... 
---
It's a story driven game, so you play the story to unlock things in a way that makes sense in the context of the narrative. In WoW you basically never have any real idea where you are because you just kind of queue for whatever is next on the party finder. Where's the fun in that?
---
&gt; Skipping story for $ because they know its a chore? I feel insulted.
---
Or, you know, they realized that people who had already experienced the story wanted to make alts on other servers to play with friends and they wanted to give them an alternative option if they didn't want to start from scratch?
---
Glad we can agree on something!
---
One final fuck you for the road, I'm going to sleep.
---
Have a shit day you damn ape.
---
I expect to see double xp and possibly a skin or 2.
---
What I would like to see is "WVW" changed to be guild based and the introduction of some battlegrounds more akin to larger versions of the ones from original WoW but with GW2 tech.
---
G'night, mate. Sweet dreams.
---
Soooooo
---
What I said wasn't incorrect? I didn't say "you can't do *any* of the content".
---
I said you can't do *all* of the content. You can't access the living story maps without doing a chapter or two of each living world story. You can't properly progress in HoT or PoF without doing at least some of their stories.
---
&gt; aesthetics are pretty generic
---
In this case they’d be seminal, since it’s the series’ aesthetics that are being copied.
---
If GW2 shuts down due to lack of "hardcore" players, then at least I will be content that a community that didn't deserve to exist finally got dissolved.
---
What is much more likely, however, is that the game will continue on as ever, with the external sites like reddit made slightly more positive due to fewer people whining. Unless the players "leaving" will linger around to spread negativity until the GW2 servers shut down.
---
My pets on my Ranger are called Don't Stand In Red exactly for this reason.
---
Buy gems.  Seriously in game farming is the equivalent of like 1$ per hour (that's not me exaggerating you can check at gw2 efficiency).  I'd rather save some money by cooking at home and do something fun rather than grind for money in this game.
---
Yep im waiting for classic im also having more fun in BFA than i am in GW2. At least there they have ingane mount skins.
---
You really are comparing apples to oranges here.
---
FFXIV was designed around playing using *one* character. Its why you can swap classes &amp; professions and level *everything* on a single character.
---
It isn't really a "big missed QOL" to cater to a very niche percentage of the player base who aren't even playing the game the way it was intended.
---
If you actually want to compare apples to apples, this would be like claiming GW2 is missing QOL content because you can't link multiple accounts together and share your wardrobe and achievements between them.
---
Its older content certainly hasn't aged well and they learned their lesson pretty quick and adjusted their design philosophy during the first expansion. If longer cutscenes annoy you then a story-focused game probably isn't for you in the first place, but even then they've improved their character writing and buildup to narrative set pieces so much that it's hard not to admire the fact that they're so keen on learning and adapting.
---
If you really did enjoy the combat and find it in yourself to continue, I'm sure you'd have a great time if you got past the initial pre-expansion hump and at least picked up a general idea of what's going and and who is who.
---
So, point made, there's no need for hardcore players to spend real money in the game?
---
&gt;Can't ArenaNet just push a little bit more content? More frequent?
---
Sorry OP, that's not how Anet does things.  You get a slow morphine drip of content with this game.  Been that way for half a decade.
---
Those are spirits from the future who buy bulks of madness in the past to get some easy money
---
Oh I agree with that; they'll for the most part have more experience and understanding.  My point is that- of two people driving the same vehicle, putting in the same amount of care, the guy putting 50k miles a year on it will likely wear his out sooner than the guy only putting on 10k a year.
---
if your pacing is that high, you'd have to recognize that at some point, you'll have done everything there is to possibly do.
---
Hardcore players make like 80g in an hour a day from "CMs + T4s &amp; recs" plus everything they do in the meantime and Raids on weekly lockouts.
---
So most likely about 300-400gems daily at current exchange rates, maybe even more but we're talking about casual 2 hours online daily.
---
No real reason to buy yourself into the game then is there?
---
FFXIV was designed to *allow* you to play all jobs using one character, but it *also* allows you to play multiple characters.  If you could only play one character in FFXIV, you would have a point, but you can even have multiple characters on the same server.  
---
So, again, while it might be your opinion that it is not necessary, the fact that it lacks QOL for multiple characters remains. Arguing the benefit of being able to level everything on one character is relevant to people who want to do that and when comparing the games as a whole, sure.  But I'm not doing that.  I'm correcting the idea that there's no reason to have multiple characters as you stated in the comment I originally responded to, pointing out why it might matter to someone and how FFXIV does lack QOL in this regard.
---
Bye then
---
You set a goal and try to complete it bit by bit, that can be aachievement, a special skin, ascended gear tied to achievements or a legendary, find something stick to it and your good to go!
---
For the Legendary weapons can you only progress so far in a certain day or can you do as much as you want in a day?
---
ever heard about legendary armor?
---
I played for about 12k hours before I quit last month.  Your experience with the game will be infinitely better as **PvX** -- someone who enjoys both cooperative PvE &amp; competitive PvP as well as casual endgame elements such as achievements and collections.  If you're more interested in PvP then try out some BR games or MOBAs, if you're more interested in raiding then FF XIV is probably where you'll end up sooner or later.  Basically, the more focused your pursuits the less satisfying becomes because ArenaNet has a really inconsistent release schedule.
---
Good, the toxic elitest players who only complain can leave. I've been playing this game since launch and think it's in a great state.
---
Game is not going anywhere
---
 Wow just paid some high profile players streamers here and in other games to do some marketing for wow classic . That's all. I wonders how is that non obvious for everyone. 
---
If u played wow Classic and you remember how it was u will never play it again
---
I think after PoF leaked in 2017 ArenaNet lost all faith in people to keep their mouths shut.
---
Ye sure never spent 18k hours in game. All of the complains that everyone brings to make the game better have no foundation.
---
Stop covering your eyes and ears.
---
I really don't understand people like you. Leave game and stop buying gems if you want to show you don't support it, don't make stupid comments and posts spreading doom and gloom on reddit.
---
People say there is no content. Roughly one month after previous one when normal players are still finishing skyscale and armor collections. In meantime we got wvw events and world events. Also, a festival and GREAT balance patch. We are two or three months away from next big update so just stop. Also we know exactly what's coming. I am hyped and content about things I still can do.
---
Saddest part showing how huge hypocrisy is here, that we are going to see insane influx of now unhappy players coming back for LS5 and praising it for features. Calling it now. 
---
If YOU think there is nothing to do, just play something else and come back later (or better not). Spreading bullshit about Anet definitely won't encourage them to talk and may force them to rush halfarsed content. 
---
You.loose.nothing.being.away.from.this.game.
---
TLDR         lfg  isn't    .     "   "    .
---
&gt; LS1
---
They didn't plan to ever release an expansion when LS1 was around, I believe.
---
After 6 years I quit. The first week was the hardest out of habit. But game is old and all the new content was lacking except for the new mount. I don't miss it anymore after almost 2 months and I am enjoying a lot of stand alone games I neglected to play over the years. My brother and one friend quit to shortly after I quit. May as well quit before it totally dies anyways right
---
It gives plenty of fashion.  You just need to grind gold to convert to gems to get it.
---
Basically you're saying that your lfg should have said "forming party about... sudoku instead of seppuku" so you don't get banned. Omegalol
---
Hardcore doesn't mean only fractals and raids, what about my friend that reached 1m kills in wvw and quit? Wasn't he hardcore?
---
Having 3 accounts is already more than 99% of this game standards
---
I played the game since beta and have 5k hours in it.
---
Currently, I log in once a day and do my daily because since I have 34k AP I did most of the stuff I wanted to do and the rest is either spending money or with considerable time investment that I currently not motivated to do, so I play other games to finally can complete some I have in my collection instead of just buying a new one and never actually playing them.
---
For me the endgame looked different depending on what I wanted to do. I played some raids with a few people and while it was fun I would have just spend too much time in it probably with little to show for it in the end. I played PvP for a long time until I just realized that I felt more frustrated after each match instead of having fun. I played WvW, and currently am more than anything else really because that is pretty much the only game mode I have not spend that much time in and only am at Rank 900-ish.
---
What I want to say with this is that you have a lot of choices of stuff you can choose from when you hit level 80. You can play PvP, WvW, Fractals, Raids, go do Achievements, gather Skins, explore the maps, just hop through the world boss events, complete the stories with all your character or just create new characters and level them up (there are quite a few players who have like 64+ characters). There is enough for you to do YOU just have to figure out what YOU WANT to do because the game will not tell you what you should do.
---
And don't shy away from content that doesn't look interesting to you. I had this with WvW in which I actually had to force myself to play the content to see that this isn't as bad as I thought it was.
---
I know the exact thread you mean , the DnT one. "DnT is quitting GW2 raiding" . I laughed . They definitely made it sound as though them leaving was the game missing out, and a death knoll for the "raid community". It was ridiculous. People come and go.
---
well, let me give you an example.  I would like to make the legendary ring from raid wing 7.  It requires 250 desert incense.  In order to get those, you first need 250 amalgamated gemstones.  There are many meta events which give 1 stone each.  However, they only give them once a day.  So it maxes at like 10 stones per day max.  But still, the gemstones are tradeable, so you could just grind gold and buy them if you want.  Converting amalgamated gemstones into desert incense is similar, a few cheap conversions daily, with a technically infinite number of conversions offered through much slower grindy content. 
---
So, its not hard gated, but your time is also spent more efficiently doing the daily progress route.
---
It's not an issue of the quantity (kinda) but quality (difficulty).
---
W7 for example, brought players back, was easier than w6, to the level of w4, cleared in 1 evening after release, nothing exciting, nothing challenging, nothing worth logging back in for. 
---
36h after w7 released it was more dead than before.
---
When I get tired of playing a game, I go play something else, but it doesn't mean I never come back to it. Often times, it just means I play less of A but just schedule other things into my play schedule.
---
But honestly, if "hardcore gamers" are quitting something they are tired and toxic of playing, then good for everyone. It will help them improve their mood and it will improve the mood of those who remain. Most MMOs aren't as good as Guild Wars 2 in the sense of how it allows you to quit and pop in at a later date without worry - take advantage of it.
---
If you mean JUST the fractal dailies, hell no , you don't make 60 gold a day doing those.
---
I feel like 'miserable people trying to spread their misery' has been this whole subreddit in the past half year or so.
---
I personally am super excited for season five as the quality of content has continued to increase over the years (for PvE). I assume we’re about to hear a lot about season five too. The main concern is the fear we’ll never see another expansion.
---
Wtf is efficiency?  
---
And I like fractals and raids, mostly fractals.  I used to run each tier daily (50, 49, 39, 29, 19 and 9) back when you had 3 dungeons and a boss for one fractal.  There was a reason to. I also did full dungeon runs. Daily.  That took a long time and was super fun,  but then Anet killed dungeons,  drip fed us fractals and have raid design that's questionable.  So while I haven't run the "new" fractals a thousand times,  the current reward structure makes it so most days I'm playing the old fractals I've run thousands of times.  Since I've fully geared my toon, I have no incentive to repeat the content so it gets old pretty quick. So I find myself getting an itch,  playing for a day or two,  getting bored and taking a break.  The new maps have no real metas and world bosses are stale since I've run them a million times.  Raids are the one thing I would be interested in,  but they are so easy there is no progression (easy is a relative term that I should explain.  No, it's not easy in the sense that pug groups can just fly through it.  Since there is no AR mechanic to force you to be at least somewhat competent before jumping into the hardstuff pugging is a shit show. It's a bit better now with dps meters allowing people to know whose doing 2dps, but it's still a shit show. But if you get a good guild it's easy peasy lemon squeezy,  at least as far as am concerned.  I'm a wildstar raider. I wiped for three months straight on the first boss of a raid and loved it!)  In GW2 you get 1 MAYBE 2 days of progression, then it's farm city for a year til the next wing drops.  And the wings are tiny! You have to wait a year for a 3-4 boss wing, that's pathetic! Other games release 9+ boss raids every 4-6 month's! 
---
So yea, lack of content is why I only play Gw2 casually now.  I'm starting to lose interest in the story(their handling of Joko was pathetic... WAAAAAY too good of a villain to kill in 2 seconds)  and the maps have been boring due to a lack of metas (Hot was all metas, POF and beyond is no metas, Anet just can't do both). There have been no new world bosses like worm or Teq (which used to be fun before Anet nerfed it into the ground). And before you say herp derp make legendaries... I have.  Two of them.  Neither were rewarding experiences.  I felt empty. All that work, just to look slightly pretty and hit no harder.  Disappointing. 
---
Once the WvW revamp hits I'll probably come back.  Friday raids were some of my best memories.
---
Casual hc players went to ff14 and the true hardcore players play osrs 😎😎😎👏
---
Monthly subs have become appealing to me. It means I don't get nickeled and dimed. I don't get inconvenienced by forced game design like making bank and bag slots intentionally small and giving you next to no character slots. You get the content to earn from a real in game achievement, instead of having to whip out your credit card or go grind some boring ass event for days on days on days just so you can open a laggy window to buy an item outright with gold.
---
&gt;toxic casuals that would rather see the game dead than giving us anything more than 1 piece of content/year which is faceroll unless it's w5 level of difficulty.
---
If they don't release the content "you" want, it's not because of an evil conspiracy of players and developers that hate you or that designers are "so stupid" that they don't see what's "obviously better" for the game according to all the reddit's armchair game designers.
---
It's just that from a game design perspective, it makes more sense as a whole to focus on what they are currently doing.
---
Although you could be right, but then ranting on reddit is unproductive and you should just apply as game designer, make a lot of money for ANet and get promotions for your outstanding work.
---
You get a free month when you buy and trust me,  once you play a sub game it's hard to go back. The lack of nickle and diming is sooooooo nice.
---
Noone cares about festivals, its always the same boring shit. We need information about real content, not these long term goals about increasing the max level of cooking/jeweler etc.
---
If you take Screenshots of your chars sure
---
It doesn't take nearly that long to level fam. Plus,  it opens up at 50, the OG level cap.
---
I'll give it a try this weekend and see if I can't get used to it.
---
“If you're not a raider, hard core WvW or hard core PvPer, the game can look a lot different. “ 
---
Please stop speaking for casuals too. Ive known hardcore players and also casual ones. They are both bored af. Just because some players are casual doesnt mean they have no taste. The same crap over and over bores EVERYONE.
---
Depends on how they voice their opinions. There are asshats who say this game sucks, I'm out and there are people who say I loved this game but it's not working for me anymore.  That variation makes a huge difference.
---
I get that some players are disenfranchised. I get that Anet is often it's own worst enemy.  But having played a lot of MMOs I've seen these comments a lot for all of them.  I've yet to play an MMO that doesn't complain about lack of balance or a content draught or people being bored.  Not one.
---
At the end of the day, the tone of posts has a lot to do with how they're received. I'm not sure why this should surprise anyone.
---
I'm playing now and then but not as much as I used to... And I can tell you about the great war that was the first WvW tournament and the greatness that once was Piken Square... #MakePikenGreatAgain
---
I'm not speaking for casuals, I'm speaking for the people who  just got through farming world event things, and then farming Dragon Bash, after farming for a Skyscale, who are casual and want a break. For all you guys who post here who say there's not enough content, I got a guild filled with exhausted people who can't catch up. Why not go talk to the 200 of them?
---
Yeah, I ahve to agree with you. Right now I am trying to find other games to play. I have BDO, Wow, ESO, and Gw2 installed. 
---
For a person new to the MMORPG genre I would definitely reccomend GW2 as the most fun for a playthrough of the content. I do think it is the most fun for a new player. 
---
The other games I think have more long time playability due to more gear grind. If you care about cosmetics and achievement points Gw2 can last quite a while. I never really cared about those though.
---
It's a game, everything is meaningless...
---
to Anet at the end of the day we aren't more than walking ATMs. In the real world without money nothing functions and Anet is a for business company where money is the only thing that really matters. So the question of which players bring in more money is relatively important as Anet is incentivized to produce content targeted to that group of players to keep them in the game.
---
I played a trial a while ago, and it wasn't for me. The latest expansion has just about the best reviews I have ever seen from a MMORPG though, so they must be doing something right.
---
i honestly would have preferred if the game was sub based then they wouldnt have had to pander to the community for gem store sales
---
Actually you can have 1 piece of legendary armor for cost of 7 ascended pieces, so it is not *that* more.
---
If this is true then I would actually be very happy. I would love to see another MMORPG from ANet.
---
I wish I got a gold every time someone told they were quitting or that the game is dying/doomed. I need the Ember infusion.
---
&gt; I'm sure there are casual/semi casual players who are also going on break or leaving the game entirely.
---
That's me. Near the end of my playtime, the only thing I enjoyed was PvP after I was kicked from my guild and had no one to play with.
---
Ping was ass and I realized I couldn't really play ranked well, so I tried my hand at getting Mawdrey, but I realized that as a casual player that was going to take me forever.
---
So I quit.
---
Maybe take off those rose-tinted glasses? 
---
It is quite obvious from your listings that you prefer GW1 to GW2, so what do you hope to achieve with this post?
---
Is it confirmed there is no expansion coming up? I don't really follow the news enough.
---
Your "I'm an inactive GW2 player" is more time / regular than my "I'm an active GW2 player".... daaaaaaaamn.
---
If they continue releasing new maps with nothing to do in them, they can officially shut down this game. New content like solo instances with a form of progression through levels (like fractals) or group survival content facing through waves of different mechanics would be what i consider new content.
---
Tell that to Astro, Squeenix fucking murdered AST with Shadowbringers. You basically can't bring them because all their potencies are so insanely low if you wanna do anything other than story content. And they destroyed the cards too.
---
[jokes on you, that's already canon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Flying_Boar_Glider)
---
Gw1 cons:
---
No jumping and underwater content
---
any bigger mmo needs an healthy amount of both type of players in order to stay healthy long term.
---
Yes casual games makes up most of time the bigger part of the community but if theres nothing for the more dedicated players and the content creators to do you ultimately will have a hard time sustaining and getting new players
---
Well as it stands, the most "expensive" account listed in the gw2 exhange values for around 1 million gold with all the account bound stuff and everything so even for the tp barons the highest total they've gathered is 1 million gold. If there would be even more accounts valued at that total, it still wouldn't be even close to the 8 billion gold mark.
---
cool.
---
I haven't done dragonfall a whole lot; is that 150 limit for unid rares in a day, week, or lifetime?
---
It just amazes me how little anet cares about wvw as a game mode.
---
It is bleeding players on a daily basis and yet they refuse to address anything players ask them. 
---
No proper balance patches, no population balance, bugs that existed for YEARS are still in the game and they just dont give a fuck. 
---
I hope CU comes out is actually good and wvw dies honestly. Anet do not deserve the success they have with wvw atm.
---
Man, don't try to talk up FFXIV combat, it's a snoozefest even when going for 95+ parses. I love the game and play it a lot now, but the combat is the worst part about FFXIV.
---
&gt; And what about the people who play multiple characters but *don't* want them to share progression?   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; What about people playing characters on other servers? 
---
What about people who don't want all their jobs on one character and would rather have multiple characters?  The what about game will take you in circles, but I imagine an optional selection at character creation would satisfy those people if the developers felt it was important.
---
&gt; There are two reasons to have multiple characters in FFXIV 
---
Multiple servers and character race aesthetics, sure, and also gearing multiple jobs without being gated, and roleplaying.  The last kind of playing into the second, but also separate because not everyone who cares about that is a roleplayer.
---
You said there was no reason to have multiple characters and I've explained three times now that there are reasons.  You might feel like it's not important enough to justify adding any QOL changes, and that's fine.  But if we're talking about what a game lacks then QOL for multiple characters is included for FFXIV.  Yes, this is offset for many players by having all jobs on one character, but you don't get to decide what's important to other people and say "sorry, you can't consider this as a negative about FFXIV because it doesn't matter to me".  
---
Also, pointing out something which a game lacks doesn't mean "this is something they should be able to do".  It just means that it's something which is lacking whether they can do it or not.  We're not going to sit here and try to argue the technical limitations of the game because it's irrelevant.
---
&gt;Huh! but the people who cleared w7 in one evening are not your normal raiders! they are highly trained highly experienced raid machines.

&gt; Jessica Price said something along the lines of Anet didn't know if season 4 will be the end of the game.
---
That's interesting, assuming she's telling the truth.
---
This would mean that at least one of Anet's side projects was almost finished and ready to make money for them. Makes it even weirder that NCSoft axed the projects. Maybe they didn't think those titles could be viable replacements and wanted to prevent Anet from burning bridges with the GW2 community?
---
FF story blows gw's away like a pancake
---
But what is the purpose to start such events? Isn't it better if you just take your squad and make it happening? Why you need game to push you towards it when you can do it yourself?
---
Many bought soul pastry because it was kinda meta for chrono back at Halloween but soon after with balance patch boonduration became useless for him so it got a huge it in being actually worthwhile food while people still have thousand saved up as an investment.
---
Things like Quickbrand didnt really got used as much as now back then, so noone used them and supply didnt train.
---
Welp, seems I was mistaken
---
When top comments in a top voted thread on GW2 subreddit is a discussion about another mmo, namely ffxiv, you know the game has no future.
---
Except doesn't FFXIV nickle and dime you anyway? There is a cash shop in this game as well.  
---
For me, the big turnoff is that I don't have time regularly, but I might have huge bursts of activity for say a week, and then leave for months. If I pay for a month of subscription, I subconciously try to  push as much time as I can to get the most out of my money. And I have less fun as a result.
---
&gt; TBH it just upsets me.
---
&gt; I don't blame them, I might have done the same in their place.
---
Those highly trained people took 24h to take down the first dhuum and 1 week for dhuum cm, in 3/4 hours entire w7 normal and cm was cleared.
---
Damage control? They do have fixed schedule for at least 2 months already, and there would have to be some huge surprise that would come instead of FotFW. 
---
Now festival for 2 weeks, then sales and anniversary with reveals of LS5 and other big stuff. 
---
If that won't happen like that, then you need all the damage control of the world because it won't be pleasant at all.
---
Wait what? Ffxiv's famous for its pve endgame
---
We aren't complaining, some of us anyway, because we're not unhappy with the game. It was 2 months ago that the last episode of Season 4 came out. 2 months. And it was WELL RECEIVED. Really. Lots of praise. People liked the new zone, the new meta, the skyscale. The skyscale collection too some heat for being too time gated, but the episode itself was well received.
---
A month later, we get a festival that's pretty much brand new. Everything in it was new from the first festival.
---
I agree, that WVW, and PvP players and Raiders aren't being taken care of...but that backs up what I said in my first post which you objected too.
---
There are always going to be some people that are disatisfied, but over all, casuals have plenty of content and we've had pretty good reviews in the last couple of months. If this playerbase, the casual portion, can't go a month without new content, there are zero MMOs they can go to.  None. 
---
So I stand by what I said in the first place.
---
The game would be a lot better off if they never released expansions tbh. I still think that HoT is when GW2 shifted from a unique online game to some shitty WoW clone that doesn't do anything right. 
---
Especially with raids: no difficulty levels, no queue system, barely any unique rewards, etc. What did people expect when Anet couldn't even maintain dungeons? 
---
I don't even like the raids in this game because of the queueing and shitty support specs. Like, I'd never play this game if I wanted to raid, I'd play FF because A) I don't have to wait an hour for my party to get ready when I can quickly queue up, and B) the support classes are much more well thought out. 
---
For me the biggest failing in GW2 is that each update is story based, but the story is terrible and the mechanics aren't great. So for me every single update is basically slogging through a 2 hour crappy ass story, then running around a new map to make gold so I can buy things that other people are selling on the market because I dont want to buy loot boxes myself. Then wait 3 months for the same thing again. This game had a lot of potential but they just focus on the wrong things frequently, half ass it because they're spread too thin, then don't bother offering fun rewards and incentives and goals for their shitty half-assed implementation of things.
---
Downloading FF14..... 50%.......
---
I'm afraid you missed that. Now it's time to say you're playing FF14 now and it has nothing to do with the fact it just released an expansion and is just because GW2 sucks and the devs missed their chance to keep you.
---
You precious snowflake, you.
---
lol
---
I believe you, never liked the gw2 story anyway
---
It's a different kind of appeal. I think a decent way of explaining it is to look at a game like Diablo 2 or Path of Exile. Hopefully this makes sense...
---
In PoE, your core gameplay experience is killing enemies to get new loot. You get stronger the more you kill and you get stronger as luck awards you with better gear. There's also a currency system in place and consumables which have value / are currency themselves. After you beat the main story, there's still more you can do for endgame, but ultimately you're just farming to get better gear or slowly approach the level cap for your character and skill gems.
---
There's also a seasonal system. At the end of the season, all of your progress gets pulled into the "standard" league. Once a new season starts, all of that wealth and all of those characters you invested into are effectively lost because the new season is a fresh restart. Some players choose to stay in standard league to stay with those investments and wealth, some embrace the reset completely by deleting their now-standard characters. Do you play for the collection of wealth or do you just want a novel experience each time you pop in?
---
GW2 is, in my opinion, ultimately a wealth collection game. Beating the story is the standard experience and there's more you can do after if you so choose, but everything you can do in regards to gameplay is generating value for your account. You can transform that value into new/more gear, vanity, account upgrades, or whatever, but it basically just boils down into picking something you want and working towards it.
---
That doesn't appeal to everyone. Hell I don't think it appeals to the majority market. The treadmill exists in GW2, but it's just to get more stuff you want rather than keeping up with the latest ilvl.
---
Comparing GW2 to other MMOs is always weird because they just have really different models. Designed obsolescence is a key part of the vertical model; I'd argue that in a wealth collection game, as long as the economy is somewhat balanced, you're probably getting more value than not.
---
I had stopped playing GW2 for years -- between just before HoT launch until a few months after PoF. The ascended gear, materials, and raw gold I had were still really useful the minute I logged back in. All of that grinding I did before still had value and I put it toward new builds and new characters. Long term I even put it toward a personal goal I had way back when to make every legendary weapon (and now armor and trinkets too) for my ele. I even got stat infusions!
---
Meanwhile in WoW: by the end of Burning Crusade I had near all max ilvl gear on multiple characters and about 10,000 gold. When WotLK came out the gold was still relatively useful but the gear got replaced by trash drops by the time I hit the new level cap. From what I understand now, gold inflation in WoW got so high that my 10k which took months to get is probably worth a  week or so of playing. My gear now would obviously be horrible and replaced immediately despite taking weeks/months to get all those pieces. All of my crafting materials or consumables in general are probably not worth much at all any more either.
---
*** 
---
All of this to say: for me, GW2 IS a comfy game I can drop and pick up again whenever I feel like it. My previous investments are almost always respected or I can relatively easily regear via stat swap if metas changed while I was away. It's a flavor I like more especially with how flexible I can be with my play time.
---
... Though, yeah, it kind of sucks when you want to do endgame stuff like fractal cm+t4 or raids and there just aren't groups in lfg at that moment / you get stuck with bad pugs. Or if you want to Eve but it just happens to be a low population time period or are on a low tier server.
---
But it´s recommended to play the ff expansions in order i guess?
---
Yeah imagine games having dedicated fans that dont all agree. Oh wait that is entirely normal.
---
Reminder that gw2 was relisting the warclaw cashgrab video because it was being downvoted too badly by the actual playerbase. 
---
But this isnt the players fault, that is to say if you piss your own players off enough that a significant fraction of them dont trust you you likely earned it. And anet definitely earned it. 
---
FFs release was garbage. They communicated and fixed their issues. League has failed to release clash for years to where it's a meme. But they are still open about their further plans even on those topics. PoE tells you where it's going. And so on.
---
Gw2? In gw2 our trash tier community manager gaile grey told players devs cant be expected to communicate with players. NO SHIT THAT IS YOUR JOB. Well thankfully not anymore. Instead she outlawed half the discussions from the forums. 
---
The players arent to demanding for this game, they're really not. Anet simply fails both in terms of content, direction, communication, building hype, balance, ... frankly all I see them do last years is milk casuals for money while feeding them PR nonsense.
---
Everything you do in life is an investment. It doesn’t become less fun for that reason.
---
Also, GW2 isn't "finished" yet, while GW1 is
---
If you go to your daily achievements tab, there's a countdown timer at the top.
---
GW2's development is unstable. It took too long to make HoT, there was a drought before and after that and ArenaNet said lesson learned - content after expansion drops and only two years to wait for PoF.
---
We are approaching the two year mark from PoF's launch and we are told there won't be an expansion any time soon. ArenaNet learned shit from the content droughts before and after HoT.
---
Season 4 did have larger gaps between releases than Season 3 and they didn't have an expansion ready to go close to when it finished. Raids and fractals are released very slowly and the combination of PoF and S4's content just can't stretch more than two years, the game is growing stale again and we know from past seasons a season cannot revive the game close to what an expansion does, not matter how much ArenaNet delude themselves into thinking it might.
---
The Living World model is killing GW2. It should have been treated similar to post-expansion patches like in WoW - expand the story, grow the expansion, put out the new dungeons, raids and maps and features to finish what began with the expansion and then set up the next expansion. Right now they are a huge time waste of dev resources gone into one and done content people blow through in a couple of hours and medium to short term content drastically suffers as a result.
---
Living World should bridge expansions, not replace them.
---
How is BD useless for Chrono? You do realize that we don't play Chaos anymore, right? xD
---
I like that this idea improves both aesthetics and game play telegraphing. Good suggestion.
---
It's just the raid/WvW community being salty with a chip on their shoulders, thinking they are the only ones who are unhappy with GW2 atm. Every part of the game is bleeding players, every part is growing stale.
---
Basically vets are complaining about years going by without an actual endgame or any real difficulty in the game, and the community either tells them the game is fine without difficulty, you would get tired of any endgame anyway so devs shouldn't bother making one, or just flat out get out and play another game if you don't like this one anymore.
---
&gt; From what I understand now, gold inflation in WoW got so high that my 10k which took months to get is probably worth a week or so of playing
---
It only takes a week you account for leveling a character from lvl70. Otherwise it's about a few hours of gameplay at most.
---
&gt; I would argue that if you are willing to pay a sub fee for more content, then you are indeed a hardcore gamer. I'm not talking just skill level here, but about levels of commitment. It's an issue I have with the entire MMO genre, and why I like GW2 more than the rest (though I admit it could be a lot better). 
---
Counter argument: $15 a month isn't that bad. My time is valuable - I only have so much in my life, I'm only in my teens/20s with free time to MMO for a limited time in my life, why waste that limited time in a sub-par MMO like GW2 if I believe FF14 is the more enjoyable experience?
---
A sub doesn't determine if someone is hardcore, it determines that someone values their game time enough in that month to spend the small amount of $15 on a sub fee. It's such a small amount to pay in a month if it means you're getting a better game experience. You can make more money, you can't get your time back.
---
In a ideal MMO this is the correct answer. Anet have shown they can only focus on specific parts of the game and even then it takes months to deliver something. So something is wrong at Anet. Either their design philosophy is impossible to upkeep and it takes months or they have a severe lack of skill/understanding of how to create new content.
---
They would have been idiots not to. It was an opportunity to bring in a large influx of players. It would be negligent to ignore it.
---
there are always games which have neither?
---
Diviner. First time we got a stuff with Concentration as major, Commandant was played a lot before, but with Concentration as minor
---
I remember that, it was a great detail (especially if you'd seen the defenses in the story mission).
---
5k rank roamer here, I quit because of the mounts. 4.5k engage skill, triple dodge, noob chariot, zzzz. Totally ruined small scale. I was actually on board with the mount for a long time but it literally deincentivizes starting a fight so I guess it's no surprise roamers are leaving. That and the balance, fuck me the balance.
---
hello
---
superspeed is actually extremely strong! you claiming it's the most useless thing in existence makes me doubt your pvp experience and knowledge
---
gyros aren't a core engi specialty, the trait affecting them isn't minor and..what do you want? how many traits affect exceeds on holo? hm?
---
it's true that some of the changes make little sense, but that's because they let the interns usually assigned to bringing coffee and pastries to do the balance this time around :)
---
I just remembered the time before there was any communication between players at all.
---
The first time I've ever beaten Tequatl, man what an event
---
Mounts didn't kill something that had been dead for years lmao
---
I highly suggest you to just play sPvP to have some fun. Don't try to play the ladder and only farm for the wings if you really really REALLY want them. I don't make more than 3 sPvP a day and I don't care about winning or loosing. And this way it's fairly fun most of the time.
---
I highly suggest you to not get a higher rank than Gold3. In G3 you have very frequent match ups (not long waiting time) and people are kinda good, but not perfect / there's not much class swapping for "perfect team comb".
---
But if you hit Platin, you'll suddenly get paired with really salty people and chances are fairly high you'll get paired with / against P3 players which are basically playing on an other level entirely (and these are also the saltiest of players).
---
That's at least my experience of the last 12 months.
---
FFXIV just got the best rated expansion they ever had and it's population that's actually higher than GW2s are paying SUB FEE.
---
How is it a dying 2k19 korean MMO?
---
I'm waiting for Overwatch new patch too :) 
---
Even tho rn I'm enjoying GW2 but I think only because I didn't play it for months.
---
Maybe they thought they would wrap up GW2 with LS5. That would mean that their LS S4 team could just continue to work on GW2 and the rest of the team would work on the next title(s).
---
50 hours haha, we got less than 5 hours this year
---
&gt; I totally get that a 2.5s GCD is depressingly slow at first glance, but most classes require you to weave 2+ oGCDs between the hardcast 2.5s attacks, resulting in a VERY fast paced combat system once you have your entire kit.
---
oh no, 1 cast per second. Have you like, ever player thief, FA ele, mesmer in PvP? Some burst patterns require you to use 10+ key presses in rotation, in a matter of 1-2seconds, not even counting movement and eventual disengage/engage. FFXIV's combat is very slow compared to GW2. I don't really think it's bad - it's just entirely different gameplay pattern that will not fit everyone, especially with it's floaty movement.
---
I've literally never heard anyone suggest that the game does NOT need casual players
---
&gt;The Living World model is killing GW2
---
So much dev work for almost 0 replayability.
---
No; I don't claim to know what they have to do. I just state what they announced they were doing.
---
As a fairly casual player (I'm not raiding and not PvPing on a mesmer), I don't really notice much difference. The biggest change is for me is that they moved one of the shatters from F5 to F4 on my chronomancer, which sucks if your muscle memory keeps trying to hit the wrong key.  
---
Many of the people complaining were raiders who were used to very specific meta builds. When the new meta builds come out, the entire thing will die down. This usually happens whenever a balance patch hits. 
---
I guess the question is what content are most interested in.
---
This is all subjective.
---
50 hours?  You'd have many "hardcore" players laughing at and saying "Try 12 hours, if you're lucky!".  You can have others who view the only new content being raids, others only living story, etc.
---
You also have many "hardcore" playing dozens of hours every week and considering it fun and valuable to them with no end in sight.
---
Hence, subjective.
---
You are correct that it is possible to make very good replayable content.  Strategy and variety with levels of randomness and more are all possible recipes for this.  Games like chess have replayability built in due to the sheer number of possibilities yet with strategy and skill involved.  Furthermore, it does not need to be in a PvP environment.  A computerized chess player will give anyone challenge as well as a human.  
---
Can you do this for video games?  Definitely, it's been done especially in many strategy games.  How about MMOs?  Yes, it's possible and rare.  I think it would be very well worthwhile to start a new thread discussing ideas for that which the developers might use.  
---
Sadly, for most MMO players, they see replayability as being just grind or following some carrot.  Many MMO players like playing for just rewards and consider that "fun" versus the game itself.  
---
Personally, for me, I do NOT want grind or chasing carrots or rewards.  I play content that is fun to play for itself. 
---
And personally speaking, while I enjoy the living story, if I was in charge, I would remove it or at least the production costs and make it more in written format for those enjoying the story.  That's because, as you pointed out, a lot of effort goes into make those couple of hours of story.  I'd personally create replayable content of the kind I was talking about.
---
However, I don't know if most MMO players could even appreciate that.  Most are blinded to just playing for rewards.  
---
As far as high level of mastery?  I'm for it, but you have to allow for players with different skills and interests.  That is create multiple levels of difficulty and options for BOTH solo play and groups.  That gives almost everyone new content.
---
Alright, thanks. I'm really hoping for some new elite specs, like everyone else I'm sure.
---
Derpy fully swapped to ffxiv recently fairly publicly and he has over 17k hours. I've got around 13k and lots of others have around 15k as well.
---
&gt;another player used the word "Sudoku" instead of "Seppuku."
---
\*Subaru
---
That was tue question that bugged me also. There's no distintion between hours played during work days and days off. Other than that, very well made survey, good luck with your research.
---
Chrono in pvp and wvw is weird without selfshatters
---
Imagine if you were only a pvp/wvw only player coming for releases, you wouldn't have logged in for over a year now LUL
---
But would it be weird to the new guy who doesn't know about them?  I don't have an answer, myself, curious though.
---
That's your "twist". GW1 didn't have a treadmill for gear, neither does GW2. And that's good.
---
A "reason to grind"... you want a reason to replay dull content over and over again to maximize profit to get that newest gear? No, thank you. I'll pass.
---
&gt; It's a little concerning that people are so apathetic towards this
---
Because there is little we can do about it. It is anet's decision to treat the game like they do. People concern the lack of meaningful content for ages.
---
You don't. It's account bound and needs level 75 scribe. Your options are join a guild (in game or on /r/guildrecruitment) or make your own guild (not really feasible for newer players since guild halls take 100g and have to be cleared first).
---
Fairly certain you still get it but you can't access it until you upgrade to PoF.
---
Same thing with LWS5 that is in the works, logon while it's active and it's yours forever.
---
Some LFG rules are really weird. What bothers me most is that selling raids is allowed while selling your home instance can get you banned (I'm ok with selling both).
---
About necro.
---
As soon as more demanding content came out, with raids as a prime example, players decided it's easier to crate min-maxed builds because enemies have timers and different mechanics that sometimes can be skipped partially or entirely with speedkilling, where best boon uptime and dps is more important than survivability. Because necro and reaper have built in tanking mechanics, they just can't be equal dps-wise with other classes. Just imagine double HP hero with best dps?
---
So what about those few cases where we need a tank? Thing is, others do it better while giving something more.
---
While scourge don't have shroud, it actually give shroud-like barrier to whole party so somehow devs decided it's enough to not be a pure dps no matter what.
---
But don't mind it. We are talking about mostly unrealistic dps numbers in perfect scenarios. Nowadays you will see necro in both specs being taken everywhere because of it's extra support on form of barrier and ressing, that's mockingly called a pug-carrier. It really saves less experienced groups but in best comps it's better to take anything else.
---
Warrior is a powerhouse currently, with a secured place in every raid and fractal, because of unique boon in form of banners and very high dps.
---
Well the point of WvW is to fight real players, not NPCs, so that's it. You can fight NPCs everwhere outside WvW 24/7. 
---
If you make it controllable by players, then ye, we already have it - golems, dragon/turtle banners, and such. Ye, there is probably still space for expansion, but the principle is already there. 
---
What rather needs to get some works is long term goals of fights - let's say, what means to win skirmish? At this moment winning skirmishes is good just for match manipulation - who you play against next week. That's not enough. (but to be fair, anet had some hints towards ideas to change skirmishes altogether, to rebalance night caps with prime times and such, plus they want to do alliances as well, so we might not see it until it all is ready...which seems like too long to wait, because we don't know what time scale it will be)
---
&gt; Who listens to radio? Do you work in advertising? lol  
---
i don't know about other countrys, but in germany basically everyone who is driving a car. one local radiostation which isn't even germany wide and just for a single state has millions of listeners in just 1h and the cost for a spot is pretty expensive. like 50 poster pay day in a city is depending on the location arround 1.3k.  
---
1 second on rushour in the radio costs 108 for a single spot!  
---
if you want to advertise to get new people, you kinda have to go outside your way and not on sides where people already know where to search. no normal person goes on twitch to get hooked on gw2....thats just bullshit. if you look on twitch or any other platform, you already know what you search...and its needed so people can inform themselfes. but the initial hook def. doesn't come over a content partner. it comes over some ad, be it before a yt video, some ad on facebook or actual ad somewhere in the tv / outside.  
---
wow had a pretty heavy ad campaign back in the days, but i guess arena net doesn't have the money for something like that.
---
Using the lfg for anything but lfg..  
---
gets in trouble  
---
:O
---
And FFXIV was a disaster at launch, while GW2 sold over 3 millions quite fast.
---
Half a decade later, GW2 has little to offer, low player retention, the raiding scene is dying, the pvp scene is nearly dead, the wvw scene is nearly dead, guild content is abandoned, dungeon content is abandoned, and a third expansion was sacrificed for a 5th living season single-player mode.
---
Meanwhile, FFXIV has been getting better and better, it has been growing, it has been consistent in what it has to offer, it has surpassed GW2 even with a sub fee, and is starting to challenge WoW.
---
That is the difference between a company that truly commits to a game and to a vision vs. a company without a vision that easily gives up on the slightest obstacle.
---
You’re right, I do demonise raiders and perhaps it’s unfair. I’ve played Guild Wars 2 since launch and it seems to me that the “hardcore” players are always the most toxic part of the community, endlessly moaning about the lack of a gear treadmill or hardcore raiding content.
---
What frustrates me is that Guild Wars as a series was designed as an alternative to WoW. It was a haven for gamers like me that don’t want to waste our lives on the endless treadmill or be around the toxicity that’s involved with hardcore content, where everyone’s at each other’s throats because they didn’t hit optimal DPS.
---
Ultimately though, you’re right - Anet chose to add raids and now we have a raiding community, and I think you guys deserve to receive as much support as the rest of us do. It just frustrates me when you act so superior to the rest of us who play the game as much as you do.
---
I suspect the lfg posting wasn't in the dungeon section...
---
Bullshit comment from an ff fanboy.
---
Add in the fact that the community also then bitches about or at the HP as they leave lol.  
---
(forgetting they will be in the same ironic place as HP in time)
---
Never and nothing.
---
Why are you trying to achieve more meaningless achievement points and daily achievements in a game with zero progression O_O
---
The reason I ask is many people say base mes is *still* worse than current chrono. In a raid scenario yes of course I agree but I'm not so sure with open worlding.
---
Weird? what do you mean weird?
---
Its a 0, thats what it is. Literally irrelevant and a slot waste now.
---
Gw2 endgame is fashionwars
---
&gt;. It just frustrates me when you act so superior to the rest of us who play the game as much as you do.
---
From what we see in reddit and forums is that there are waaay more people like you who simply hate players that play more than open world and dress up. Just scroll through this very post and you will find several examples.
---
&gt; The irony of this comment is utterly staggering.
---
Which comment? Because mine said literally the same yours did.
---
That I do not know, but I guess, as each MMO provides them in chronological order (like GW2).
---
You'll end up doing that anyway, as the level cap increased with each one. The story for an expansion is always locked behind the story from the previous expac too iirc, as it's meant to be one continuous tale continued between expansions. Think something kind of like living world, but you've got to play through each episode in order.
---
how is gw2 pay 2 win?
---
Nope, not true. You can use teleport to friend or the living world portal scrolls to access living world maps without doing story.
---
tbh its because of that teapot guy, after that everyone starts being so vocal, and then there's this guy even made "GW2 refugee welcome" in ffxiv reddit, and boom this is the current situation rn
---
I don't have an issue with long cutscenes and narrative driven games. But when half of those cutscenes are boring and drawn out bits of completely useless information, I can only sit through so much of it.
---
that's why i said it ;)
---
As I said, you can use a lvl 80 booster. You get one for each expansion you buy. Warrior raid ready in a few minutes. Need gold for equipment? Gems to gold. Fresh account raid ready.
---
ESO probably has the worst character animations i've seen in any game
---
You don't know what you are talking about. Watch an NA raid streamer like novagw2 and you will see that prime time NA has maybe 3 actual raid lfg that are not sells. This has nothing to do with roles you play.
---
My bad. Just rolled out of bed and must have misinterpreted your comment.
---
You've completely misinterpreted my post, but I can see why you'd draw the conclusions you draw. I'm actually saying stuff the other way around.
---
As a casual player who don't raid, and therefore I don't really pay as much attention to a rotation at all, even though I do know what skills so, I haven't noticed much of a difference. I'm not using a damage meter. I'm not doing much differently than I was doing before because I tended not to self-shatter in the first place. This isn't picking at the raiding community. 
---
I believe most people who play this game don't self shatter. They get some clones up and shatter when they have three and maybe two have recharged, if they even do that.  A significant percentage of the players of this game have never been to the trait screen, nevermind looking up a meta build on meta battle or snow crows. In fact, I'd wager a decent percentage of open world PvE players aren't even aware meta builds exist.   
---
My comment was with my mediocre playing, I don't notice much difference, as in I'm not killing stuff any slower than I used to kill stuff and I'm doing all the content I was doing before. I'm not finding it significantly harder after the patch, or really any harder at all.
---
I'm sure good players, raiders who know their stuff might see a different, but as a more casual player I don't.
---
I would argue that I will still miss more than I would avoid by unsubscribing, that's why I did not say that I feel like leaving the subreddit, but that they probably should be split.
---
&gt; **How is this game after lots of play time?** 
---
Still fun to play :)
---
\----------
---
You could check out the PvP content or unlock all the core, HoT &amp; PoF masteries, ect.
---
You could work on the fashion of your chara
---
You could buy an other chara slot and play an alt class with completely different combat mechanics
---
You could explore the world and find your own little challanges and beautifull little details, ect.
---
You could level your crafting disciplines
---
You could build ascended gear sets and weapons
---
You could craft legendary weapons / gear / trinkets
---
You could farm up the Fractal ladder
---
You could get into raiding
---
You could start achievement hunting
---
ect.
---
Psshh ^(it was sarcasm)
---
Tf you on about this game is the most casual friendly shit when it comes to gearing.
---
What do you want? Gear on login?
---
I remember a few years ago I saw my SO play and all he ever did was wait in dungeon queues, do raid bosses, and grind for better and better gear. Was kinda hoping things would be different at this point. Does the new expansion adds more stuff to do?
---
[The fire elementals everywheeere](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fire_Elemental_Powder)
---
Fair enough
---
I believe you! I think the problem stems back to what I said earlier — GW2 and the first before it were designed as alternatives to WoW but now that GW2 contains raids that point is redundant.
---
I support you guys and if you feel you aren’t getting what you need from the game then I share your frustration. I’d love more metas and cosmetics that you have to work for versus just buying them in the gem store.
---
But overall, I’m happy with Guild Wars 2. It’s not perfect and it feels like Anet has lacked direction ever since it launched but then I’ve tried all of the alternatives and they all pale in comparison to GW2.
---
FFXIV is at it's highest subs ever IIRC.
---
Wouldn't say that's dying.
---
Everyone is bitching about no endgame, and here I am with about 2000 hours in wvw, and WvW being my main gameplay.  In end game there's jumping puzzles, PvP, WvW, fractals, helping newbs, living world and running around the fountain in a city, and about a billion achievements. Who says there's no endgame? I used to spend hours running around the fountain in lionsarch, to bad they fucked lionsarch up, that's some gameplay I won't get back sadly.
---
Yeah me too, Honestly I don't like many of the things on the gemstore but at least if they was ingame rewards it would be way better than now.
---
/shrug then the game is not for you :^) Starting an mmo late in the game is always a bitch that should be common knowledge kek
---
They get so much nerfs lately, because they were completely broken and OP for almost 7 years.
---
I'm just quoting the comment that were defending w7 on the first kills thread.
---
I didn't come back to try w7 myself but I believe for example SC first clear time is a decent indicator for the difficulty of the raid. (idk how many people cleared it on first evening because I'm not in touch with what's going on there rn)
---
Will that also work if I complain about line casting getting removed from icebox and meteor shower?
---
Several bigger wvw guilds transferred off TC to BP iirc, which is why it feels a little emptier. TORK, in which I play, is still around and active in the evening and afternoon depending on the commander.
---
most people run full diviners anyway tho because they're too lazy to switch between armor sets for raids and fractals. I actually know only 1 person who has different gear for fracs and raids.
---
In a way, yes. But cosmetic *endgame* is supposed to mean that youare working towards better looking gear. All best best gear is nwo permanently reserved for the gemstore.
---
So the gemstore is the endgame. You play with your credit card. Once you realize that, this game becomes a shallow moneygrabbing scheme.
---
I played over a year ago and for not very long so forgive me if I'm incorrect but bag space was the big one for me. Without buying the extra bag slots you cant do trade skills and have to manage inventory after every quest. Also, can buy gold for real money? How is this not pay 2 win?
---
I could see either FotFW or Season 5 behind announced today or next week. In the meantime, we could get a Current Event and another bonus week event for next week.

Acquiring the most bwee? 
---
Its honestly all I really care about these days, looking awesome being the main reason gw2 has to actually be an MMO.
---
Large meta events are cool and I do love seeing everyone work together to complete a map.
---
I stick with GW2 just because it's the least intrusive MMO in a sea of pick your flavour of online primarily single player focused theme park.
---
&gt;  The only thing no one seems to notice is thst everyone wants something different and the devs are actually doing an ok job of balancing interests.
---
They're doing a horrible job.
---
Nobody is asking for 100% of the content to be hardcore raids or that all content should be solo-able but there is a clear heavy focus on living story which has no replayability.
---
Raids come every 7 months, WvW and PvP are practically abandoned, When was the last time we had a CM fractal? I've got no idea.
---
You're making out like GW2 is comparable to WoW and their pumping out content for all modes over time - They are not. They're dropping a raid every 6 months and hoping for the best.
---
Not sure why they didn't just save time and make raid boss versions of living story encounters. Like trials from FFXIV.
---
That’s two Dunkey references I’ve seen in one night of looking at Reddit at work.
---
Well thats your opinion there are plenty of players who do see festivals as content.
---
I did lead a hero point train with a lvl 1 warrior some time ago.
---
Was soo much fun. xD
---
Didn't get any of the HP's cause I couldn't hit enemies (missed them)
---
But you'll die a lot. Especially those pocket raptors had been endbosses to pass.
---
This is a legit complaint. There aren't really fun new metas to play for people who don't like raids or fractals, either.
---
I get dungeons are dead, but would be nice for those to get a revamp or to see a new dungeon, too. Just something different.
---
How about giving us tournaments instead of a festival. The tournaments is already there it just need to be fixed to work with the game now since it was long ago we had them. Just merge the empty servers first. Super easy and wont take years before it happen and wont destroy the rest of WvW as alliances will.
---
Fashion wars died with outfits, RIP.
---
What shitstorm?
---
So, what would you like them to do? have an update every every day, every week on what is going on? What if that is always the same stuff that most definitely many don't even understand in the community. Like trying to recalculate the normals on a new mesh they generated for a new enemy they are developing. What about they talk about those things and future content get spoiled because of it? What about things in development that get scrapped because they don't work, are too expensive or are postponed because other things are more important or need to implemented first?
---
They didn't promised anything other than that GW2 is not being forgotten but rather gave you what you asked for, a look at what is being planned.
---
And by the way, just because you don't like content doesn't mean it is rehashed or disappointing because, you said it yourself, you had fund the first few weeks.
---
The thing is, you don't have a subscription fee, you don't have to force yourself to play the game, the only thing that forces you to play the game is you yourself. If you can't find something that is interesting to you in the game then just take a break. Geez
---
I am really hoping for season 5 news or announcement. If they announce Four winds they need to have something come with it having back to back festivals are a bad idea. I wouldn't say festivals are shit content I like the GW2 festivals they are different enough from other MMOs I just think going from Dragon Bash to Festival of the Four Winds which is an incredibly popular festival would hurt the festival just because its coming so soon after another festival.
---
tbh cant differentiate it in this post anymore
---
The exact food that you need depends on your total stats, I'm well aware of that. My point being was (And still is) that Soul Pastry is definitely still a meta food.
---
Some people bought accounts on sale for cheap just to get free mats on login.
---
IIRC some people had upwards of 10 because it was easy t6 for legendarys.
---
&gt; People are jumping ship because the hardcore community is being chased out by people who keep saying "Go play another game".
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Now they are doing exactly that, and people are shocked?
---
This is nonsense.  First off, how hardcore are they if they leave just because someone told them to.  lol  and second, who is shocked?  The content drought and lack of future is what are driving people away, not those saying "go play another game."  People need to grow the fuck up.
---
&gt;  LFG for fractals and raids are almost dead (in NA anyway)
---
EU lfg isn't any better, well there are still plenty of groups but most good players left already. So now trying to pug raids is a clownfiesta 99% of the time, that will take over 6 hours to do full clear. When like a year ago, you would join random group on reset, and be done with full clear in about 3 hours. And it's getting worse, with every "balance" update.
---
If you want the game to succeed, try making posts that are less panicked and more measured, with some degree of reason to them. Saying that we need answers, and claiming a well received story episode was a bust doesn't make you a hero. You didn't see all the compliments that episode got? And just a month ago they released Dragon Bash which was mostly well received as well.  This is the kind of post that doesn't help the game, and doesn't help the community.
---
wow, re used content :O
---
What's ur specs, and I think theres definitely some sort of artificial cap on it (Game, monitor, GPU idk)
---
But the ingredients and craft the time gated things (carbonized mithrilium, bolt of damask, elonian square, and skyscale food). Because people don't want to wait 90 days to craft these themselves for a legendary, will pay a premium above cost of ingredients. Usually good for about 4g.
---
Buy the deeply discounted and discounted keys and buy the fractal encryptions. Open then, vendor and sell the contents. Each one opened with a deeply discounted is good for about 10s and the discounted about 5s, so a total of 4.5g.
---
Everything in your list except the fifth click is legal. There's no prohibition against dynamically redefining your keys. One human action = one game action. The fact that another action outside the game (redefine key) is happening is irrelevant.
---
The fifth click may or may not be legal depending on how you interpret the rules.
---
Add me on NA if you want a Nice rundown of PVP!!! Drydude.3986
---
&gt;People were quite happy at the end of LS4, that's a fact, and people were quite happy that they ASKED for Dragon Bash, for more festivals to round out the year with and Anet DID listen and deliver that...
---
The festivals are literally recycled content that costs them nothing. Many people expect more than just a single player story episode every quarter. I'm glad that you're happy and satisfied with that but others play other game modes and expect some kind of content in those areas too.
---
they told us what will happen in the near future , season 5 wil happen and has expension like quality. Legy runes and sigil, 500cooking and jeweler aswell. do you need a weekly reminder for it?
---
except it was an enterly new event compared to the 2013 version, with new stuff and removed old stuff.
---
chrono is absolutly fine in oper world,like any other class,you can still use cs,if you are able to use s3.
---
How do specialisations work? I'm assuming you can only choose 1. If so, can you change at a later point?
---
This hits hards, I stopped playing about a year ago after playing almost everyday since launch. 
---
I was just burned out by the copy paste content and awful story. 
---
Maybe I'm just at the age where mmo's are not fun anymore, but man I had some great times.
---
When they first announced Soulbeast, I thought they were going to have the pet turn into an energy cloak like the official art. Since they made it a dumb looking swirl I've lost all interest in Ranger. Plus they made the most optimal thing to do be always stay in merged form. I played Ranger because of the pets, I'd rather have the mechanic be something that you can't keep up 100% of the time, maybe 50-50.
---
The problem is less about the game being 7yo and more about the fact each update is handled in a couple of hours (with the counterargument of free updates without fees, yes)
---
As well as a few mini events thrown in
---
stop destroying my entertainment Nico
---
I havent played FF14 myself yet (gonna try it out soon) but from what I have heard, the game gets a new content patch every 3 months. I am just tired of Anet not telling us what their plans with gw2 are (will season 5 be released at all? What is coming after? Do we get a new raid wing/fractal? who the fuck knows at this point) but another living story season with maps that give us 2 hours of content is just not enough. If Anet keeps doing the same over and over again, more and more players will leave (including myself).
---
It's vocal minority actively trying to make game look like it's tanking to the point that it's on the verge of vote brigading (you just need to be on few public discord servers to know that), few people looking for attention and smol mob of people who don't want to be left out of the circlejerk. Also a bit of people envious that other players have fun. Part where other games are right after/before big expansions is also important point, meaning that regular play migrations are happening right now - MMOs population always heavily fluctuates around them.
---
~~Lately I also feel it's like anime/weeb hate situation, where most of the memes and hate threads are made by "veteran" anime watchers that live on nostalgia and hate on moe or just want to troll people.~~
---
Not about the dwarves specifically, but I'd love a Depths of Tyria expansion with caves so large they almost don't feel like caves. Bioluminescent ceilings and all.
---
but the content they get are easily passed in few days just like in gw2.
---
the main difference between gw2 and ffxiv that devs are vocal about their future.
---
Yeah, episode 6 was definitely not a bust. Great map, story, and long term content.
---
\*Silvaries
---
I mean, VG is absolute joke compared to 100CM, or even normal mode with right instabilities. So 75 is probably around that.
---
PvP (along with a couple of other things) is an excuse for ANet to call this game MMORPG instead of single-player NPC simulator.
---
Why is it important that there is an expansion coming? We get content updates every 2-3 months? We get more content in the same amount of time as other games with a single Expansion and we don't even pay for it!
---
I agree with the Fractal and raid wings, but the problem with that is that some of the community just either can't read or just don't care. Many incorrectly thought that ArenaNet promised they release 6 raid wings each year, well turns out that this was what they planned.
---
Season 5 will take 12-18 months to release if they have 6 episodes and the same release schedule. We know that Season 5 will come and soon but not when exactly but probably in the next month. So there is enough time to talk about what comes after season 5. I mean, this is like blaming a studio for not talking about a season 7 of a TV-Show while season 6 hasn't even started yet.
---
And what would you do with all of this? Keep playing? What would that change in the game if you know or don't know?
---
What those posts do is to create fear, fear and spreading guesses and misinformation. ArenaNet will do something since this is their only product now, we know that Season 5 releases soon and when we look at other releases can think about content for the next 12-18 months.
---
Right; having a productive discussion about how to improve things is one thing, but a lot of people are just throwing temper tantrums where they declare that the game is dead and unplayable unless they get what they want. Obviously the latter isn't going to be well received by the larger population that is happy to lose the toxic base, or who doesn't have fundamental problems with the structure of Gw2.
---
Well, I'm glad that they went...for how much i also like hard content, I came to realize that GW2 isn't suited for the hardcore player at all...If i wanted to go hardcoring, i would go for FFXIV like many did. So it's all the best for them, so that they can finally enjoy an MMO again.
---
It all boils down to either accepting this truth and taking GW2 for what it is, and playing on an off, or just getting burned and leaving for good...to MAYBE come back some years later...there isn't much of a choice.
---
It is an annual festival. We know this because 1. it has annual achievements, 2. why goes through all that work if it isn't annual and the excuse "because we just killed a dragon doesn't work" we killed Mordy and didn't get dragon bash. It would have been a waste of resources just for one year. Finally a dev on the dragon bash playthrough stream said its an annual festival but you need to go watch that stream to find it mainly because I'm lazy.
---
So am I confusing this game with another? Checked the wiki says you can buy the extra bag slots with gems from the store, they cost real money. Is it possible to do trade skills while leveling without the bag slots? Is gold worthless? Can also buy gold with real money?
---
Yes, they told us many things :)
---
Not to bend your strange flex but both wow and ff get more content in a year than gw2 gets in 5 years :/ 
---
Even no man's sky got revitalised faster than gw2 gets meaningful content
---
You aren't alone
---
Yeah but a likely reason why all the vocal minority is so toxic about a game that clearly isn't working for them and clearly has no plans to cater to them, is because they're stuck in the sunk cost fallacy. "I spent thousands of hours playing this game and it's going to feel like a waste if I stop playing or if the game moves on without me, so instead I'm going to try and browbeat a community and a company into supporting the content I want so that I can stay with the game." When in reality if they were just starting the game today and didn't like it, they'd just leave, or take breaks.
---
The fact that people are getting offended by the idea that maybe they need to take a break or play another game for awhile says it all.
---
I'm more interested in Veggie Burgers myself
---
how is that pay2win? you can get 120 slots without buying a single bag slot.
---
even if you convert gems to gold that doesn't buy you any skill, if you're bad you're gonna be bad also with 100k gold.
---
PAY2WIN KEK
---
It looks like you haven't looked into GW2's base-game animations.
---
It was the other way for me, after quitting GW2 for almost 4 years i returned while playing ESO. As i am not up to date: Did they fix the inventory space / bank space problem? I dont want to invest monthly money but without ESOplus, inventory mangement is really bad. ESO is still a very good game but i cant imagine playing it again without more bank space and own material storage.
---
Now imagine spending the time and the developers on Living world episodes instead of expansions. They already said and delivered that they can bring "expansion worthy" mechanics in Living world episodes like new mounts with the Roller Beetle and the Skyscale, so why shouldn't it be for other things as well.
---
IMO, in GW2, an expansion doesn't offer as much as other MMOs do and they probably have released more content with living world than with the expansions. 2 years between HoT and PoF and I completed PoF story in roughly the same amount of time as every Living world story combined. Truth be told, I spend more time in Living world episodes than in and of the Expansions in the same timeframe.
---
But that is the problem really, if everyone thinks that when a game is dead just because it doesn't get expansions then there is not really something that will help. Other than pumping out expansions that the players have to pay for.
---
So because it's free we're supposed to like it no matter what? 
---
And it's not really free, the entire game pays the price.
---
You can totally do raids in exotic (dirt cheap at the AH) and there is no gear threadmill. You can then just gear yourself with raid looted ascended if you really hate farming.
---
So, in other words, you don't have a background in advertising and do not understand why most marketing efforts prefer targeted approaches so budgets go further as opposed to a scattershot method that yields poor returns. Cool.
---
The main point is that you can use gold to get the "cash" shop stuff. So even if one would consider having bag space as "winning", you'd do it this way like many people actually do.
---
I really hate the new types of living world, wish it was happening in the world like it did before, attack on lion's arch, and the clockwork attack on that mountain (can't remember the name lol) etc. I would prefer more living world rather than getting a new zone that will be a ghost zone with in a few months. You already have a huge world, why not make use of it.
---
I don't know.. is it worth comparing HoT.. to anything? It was a rollercoaster disaster. It felt like they did literally everything in 9 months of crunch time on a whim decision of finally making an expansion.
---
I predicted all of this. All. Of. This. As soon as the first rain was announced.   All of it.
---
Because they don't announce expansions early in the development cycle. They wait until within 6 months of launch, generally. Otherwise delays, problems, and other setbacks piss off the base. Changes to the scope, even if communicated with contingencies, get people upset. 
---
They're not going to announce an expansion, or even that they're working on one, until it's playable. They never have - and to have meltdowns because they haven't announced something that takes 2-3 years to develop, especially after a restructure of their staff, is irrational. 
---
They announced LS5. Which will obviously lead into the next expac.
---
Ironically, your pet is going to stand in the red. :p
---
I only started playing some weeks ago so I don't know how it used to be.  
---
Without ESOplus you get up to 200 bank slots, 200 inventory slots per character (although 60 of those are linked to the annoying riding skill system) and I believe up to 360 coffer/chest slots in your houses. Crafting bag is still locked to ESOplus.
---
My bank is filled with crafting materials and my money goes into buying more inventory space - but until now I haven't really found too much stuff worth keeping. However I have only recently hit CP160 and started working on my first max level gear. It might change soon but until now inventory space has been sufficient if only barely at times.
---
It's probably just the 2-3 generation power gains, I'm also running the DX12 mod so it should be leveraging multi-core better. I know the 980ti-1080ti was a big jump, 1080ti-2080ti is like.. a 30% performance difference or so.
---
And then you zoom in close to your armor and realize how ugly it is because the resolution of the textures is extremely low.
---
I'd still recommend to play at 4k, the game generally looks better.
---
Imagine Anet would actually manage to stick to the 2-3 month new content release schedule AND bundle alternating new fractals and raids in these releases. Much more people would still be happy, although there would still be complains about the quality or difficulty of new fractals and raids I guess. But alas, in 2018 there was only one time a break shorter than 3 months between releases. Until now in 2019 not a single time.
---
You can play whatever you want in open world. You can literally run around naked with a staff as a base mesmer and figure out a way to make it work.
---
Everything you mention affects endgame stuff, but doesn't really affect open world exploration or events in the slightest.
---
To be fair, losing the on-demand 1,5 seconds of invul and immunity to being dragged in-combat is pretty big in open world as well. It's not like its class breaking, but its quite the QoL loss if you're accustomed to better times.
---
Not that it matters for nooblets, true.
---
I predicted all of this the day that raids were announced. All of it.
---
I'm no newbie and it hasn't seemed to matter much to me. The open world isn't something I've ever really had trouble with on a chrono, even in HoT.
---
I've been in a raid static for over a year, and I still consider myself casual. We once pulled a random from LFG, and he did like 50% more dps than our top dps.
---
When I played wvw in Jade quarry we called you "Badge Gate" because of how bad you guys were.
---
They don't "avoid interaction all together" they've told us what's coming next and are actually working on it. I guess I'm not that invested in the franchise that I'm hanging onto every word and waiting for any hint of future content when it's plainly not that complicated. 
---
Also, pretty sure Gaile is gone isn't she? Perhaps she wasn't so trash tier considering the level of communication has *allegedly* declined even more than what we've had over the last 7 years. lol. 
---
My point still stands - devs don't discuss shit still in development because there are too many people that live their life in the game and flip out when things change. I can't fathom hanging onto a game that fails to meet expectations, as seems to be your case. If they fail on every front, why are you still here? Do you have nothing else in your life to put your time toward? How sad.
---
Hi
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5ak6x0/which_dungeonsdungeon_pathsfractals_are_soloable/
---
Thank you! Some how in my dozen or so google searches this one never came up.
---
&gt; That's why I left WoW. I wasn't a "hardcore" there, the classes I played just weren't fun anymore.
---
Between the awful story and the utter gutting of my class, I left too. I wasn't going to let escalation of commitment keep in something I just couldn't enjoy.
---
Gaile is gone. Hype! Who alleges their communication declines? It's been terrible for 7 years straight. 
---
I dont play much. As many other players I prefer to spend my time on other games. I'd like for gw2 to be playable but atm it isn't. I'm here, that is on reddit and discords, to socialise with people and share opinions. Something that is frowned upon in game at this stage.
---
Funny to see that even on these posts, you'll paraphrase if you dont like the direction of the game you should gtfo toxic attitude. Sad indeed!
---
Because ANET has been catering to the casual play groups a bit too much. With wing 7 being cleared within two HOURS of release it's a little demotivating to continue to try.
---
it was useless for a while when they changed boon share of soi to be fixed duration
---
GW 2 doesn't even register 10 skill activations per second. Count the key presses in a SC benchmark video with a difficult rotation, and report back to us.
---
Everything gets downvoted here, it's a dead sub.
---
dead
---
and that's great for FFXIV but irrelevant to what i said
---
&gt;  take breaks in-between patches
---
It's one of GW2's strengths, honestly. Players can take breaks and come back with no loss in power (aside from balance nerfs and/or needing to update gear sets). Maybe it doesn't have enough depth to be a "main" game for the more hardcore set, but it's a great side game for a short burst or to come back for content.
---
What? No, sorry if you misunderstood me. GW2 is prolly the best community in communications I feel.
---
I was talking in the very early days, when you were lucky that you got 20 people together for Tequatl or any major event. Since everyone was new basically no one knew what to do or how to do an event.
---
And today there are world event guilds, timers, commanders and so forth. 
---
Back then you were lucky when you beat Tequatl and now I can't imagine Tequatl ever failing again.
---
&gt; With unid gear, either sell directly on TP, or ID and salvage. Never salvage directly.
---
What's the reasoning for this?
---
So that they can fleece people who want them but didn't stock up.
---
You are using speculation as fact? Thank god you aren’t a scientist.
---
I agree not new content but still content whether you like the content or not.
---
I get you WHile my case is a bit different I understand the feeling. I am 30, the friends ive made where from my days in high school  and while we are  still friends we live far away and they dont share my gamin preferences. Now as an adult i dont have any nearby IRL friends because its hard finding people with my same interest.   
---
Like so many other people did say THATS the good part of the game. you KNOW they are interested on the same thing , you can literally discuss anything ingame with them.  Never thing about stuff as bothersome or anything. I still have trouble talking on discord with my guild but i know that no matter what if its about ingame stuff itll never be an issue.
---
1000x this.
---
We were consistently losing the match, with the Support Firebrand and Reaper always killing anybody on Mid and losing home due to a thief. Then when the enemy team had ticked up to about 490 we somehow decapped and held their points and was downed on far but ticked to victory at the last second with our Holo stealth stomping an enemy before we could die.
---
Remember when this \*\*\*\* was worth basically nothing? The profits.
---
&gt; as opposed to a scattershot method that yields poor returns  
---
WoW TV ads, billboard ads, even in the radio for a time...same still with any big company like samsung which have ads literally everywhere.  
---
how many people do you think would answer "i have no idea what it is" when you ask them about a certain product? they do not need to know the specifics, but that is already enough to make them potentionally check out something related, and may it be for a friend / kid / whatever as present.
---
You people get so dramatic and drastic all the time. This game is far from dead. 
---
Either that or dead game for you has a *very* broad meaning, at which point you're the meme itself, not these MMOs.
---
As for me, I wouldn't ever come close to considering playing that weeaboo s\*\*t.
---
Cof p1,p3 can be solo (u need use bug), AC detha p2 can be solo but is hard.coe story can be solo too.
---
Just time it or shut up. I programmed rotation macros and GW 2 definitely doesn't register 10 actions per second. End of discussion.
---
Unless they radically alter their pass efforts with expansions I'm not so sure an expansion on the horizon would really change anything because PoF ultimately was a bunch of LS episodes/maps come all at once maybe a little more fleshed out and + elite specs. 
---
For players who are sick and leaving from the content style of LS releases a new expansion would need to actually promise some kind of long term content, be it the revival of dungeons with one connected to each map and it's lore, or a bunch of new fractals or raids or any kind of meaningful content that requires a group and co-ordination beyond pressing F and 1 in open world.
---
Dunno, haven't been able to force myself to get through the story. It's so incredibly boring that I'm most likely quitting MMOs altogether.
---
It's currently on medium. Everything but the greens are exclusive dyes.
---
Sanctum of Rall was my first server! Man, we didn't always do great in WvW but we sure had fun.
---
IMO it's been a "meme" for a long time. ArenaNet set out to make a game with _killer_ design philosophies. They wanted you to enjoy action combat. They wanted it to feel good. They wanted to do awesome things where you combine skills with combo fields and finishers. They wanted you to have around-the-clock WvW as a proper game mode.
---
What we got?
---
* Action combat that has tab targeting and feels clunky in a lot of parts (albeit, the combat is really good and really high skill ceiling)
---
* Combo fields are a super clunky part of the game -- new player standing in more than one field and uses a finisher? Good luck predicting which one goes off
---
* WvW was abandoned for a _long_ time content wise
---
* They tried to do vertical prog by way of fractals and raids, but far too late
---
* Some of their best content was LWS1 and it is now unplayable to most of the game
---
Mind you, I fucking love GW2. I still play it and I enjoy it. But it's teeth-grinding because instead of focusing on their design pillars, they doubled-down on putting out mediocre content for people that like to farm maps on repeat. Players were the problem. The best PvPers have quit. Why? They're bored. People who enjoy raiding and challenging end game were gone long before raids because GW2 had no solution.
---
It left us with a player base of casuals who don't care about the design pillars that made the game good.
---
(Note: I really love the game, just admit it has flaws and am obviously painting them hyperbolically. Love GW2 and think ArenaNet still does a great job.)
---
I dare you to beat any raid boss while standing in one place and getting healed the whole time, I fucking dare you
---
GW2 is the Budweiser or MMOs. If you aren't discerning it doesn't offend but it doesn't fully satisfy. If you are looking for something specific you are going to be disappointed.
---
I'm inferring from experience. What they've done so far, what they've spoken about how things work, the things they've said were impossible to do, and the things they've done even thought they said they were not possible. 
---
All of GW2 works on skills and effects. Based on datamined info and updates over the years, it seems that event stats in gear are a form of effect, and even emotes and gathering are a kind of skill. 
---
Since players can get different effects based on the pet they got, even if the aura was attached to the Beastmode instead the effect, that could change.
---
Signet of inspiration grants swiftness but in combat it's just wasting (solo, open world, power build) an utility slot. You can always put Runes of Firework in armor (power, boon duration, 25% speed boost and grants 3 boons in combat).
---
I would say 100% he isn't, why is the label needed in this argument
---
The Pikachu shocked meme is incorrect here.
---
If a person doesn't like any game they need to give feedback to the devs, go play something that they do like, keep tabs on the game to see if it changes. Its just stupid to be spending your freetime on something that makes you unhappy.
---
I wouldn't even display the shoulders tbh. There's quite a lot going on there already, so imo shoulders would be too much.
---
You're defending the notion that people leaving the game, and by extension damaging their communities (friends beng friendless, guilds thinning out, bonds being diminished, etc...) is a good thing?
---
This community, holy shit.
---
I quit gw2 by just enjoying other games. I might come back, probably not though.
---
^ Often said by people to players who have already been around since launch and did just about every piece of content that's been released.
---
It'd help if condi bosses weren't nearly synonymous with Mirage bosses.
---
Detha's path is soloable. You don't have to drag oozes to the trap if they are in the trap. Just lift them.
---
I don't know how long you played but SoR was number 1 for I think at least a year or so (I quit after that) after some of the Henge of Denravi guilds came to us.
---
I helped found a WvW guild called Pain Train Choo [Choo] - we were extremely active in WvW and active also in GvG. Lost contact with all of those guys - but had some crazy fun times with them. ^^
---
Imo the pink is too strong and bright, should be purplier, and the green is a bit out of place also
---
Never surrender!
---
From your link: "Not sure if many of the people here are aware but recently a big part of the hardcore GW2 community is jumping in FFXIV."
---
STOP WITH THE FEARMONGERING.
---
1 guild changed and left for another game like that has never happened. We are talking millions of players for both FFXIV and GW2 each. People are going to be quitting and moving back and forth.
---
Play the game that you like. Let others decide what they want to paly. Stop worrying about what the cool kids are doing.
---
I'm with this gentleman here. In terms of gold-per-hour, you can make far, FAR more simply by eating cheaply for a meal or two and then tossing that saved ten bucks Anet's way.
---
I know some people are philosophically opposed to spending real cash for in-game funds, something that some of the posters below delve into. But for me, personally, if I need gold for a new outfit I want, some mats for Ascended crafting, a Guild Hall upgrade or what have you it's a LOT more time efficient to just save ten bucks rather than grind Silverwastes for hours.
---
You don't get taught anything during leveling. Calling that a tutorial is a far stretch.
---
I think in the same way. I've been playing for 6 years casually and Now I started to chase more end-game content. So, there are loads of things to do. Therefore, can't complain. However, some nerfs they've done made upset, but I won't quit the game for it.
---
It was so fun xD
---
Never liked those all dark characters. They all look the same, they all have the same hood and the same weapon skin line.
---
My personal opinion: Play the classes you think you will like, than decide later what you want to main!
---
I started as Mesmer as my main class, and ended up, after months testing new classes, choosing the Necromancer as my main!
---
I only don't have Warrior and Engineer yet! (but before the end of this year I will get both ) 
---
Just level up one character till 80, then do WvW to get Tome of Knowledge and use it to level up the other characters easily!
---
I hope it helps, have a nice day!
---
Or play multiple classes and crafting / gatherer jobs... i can see the issues in future.
---
We are doing Renegade Quickbrand groups in our statics for month now. No reason to not run it. Even does more damage than the Chrono Druid one.
---
&gt; I can spend 100 hours in GW2 getting another shitty glove skin and 10 AP
---
This. GW2 doesn't respect my time. 
---
No, I don't "want it now," but I need to feel what time I do invest in a task is worth it. A single skin (aside from legendaries or their aesthetic equivalent) shouldn't be more than a few hours of effort. Or a week of smaller daily tasks.  
---
Instead, what GW2 typically asks is 1000 map currency, some already-expensive material that shoots up in price, and 38/38 achievements tied to multi-step collections and in-story instance challenges that aren't quickly repeatable but easy to fail.
---
I think that GW2 really just is best suited to casual play.
---
I'm a reasonably hardcore player, in other games. I raid in prog in WoW and FFXIV. I tried out GW2 raiding and I was like, 'it's ok, but these other 2 games do it better'. I keep playing GW2, but I don't raid. I just do the living story and a few achievements. IMO, it's a fun casual pass time, but it fails if you want it to be something more.
---
So, I can see why Hardcore players would leave to those other games, if that's all that they're looking for.
---
Luckily, GW2 doesn't have a sub, and the horizontal progression means that they could pop back in at some time in the future, and not be caught behind.
---
Dang, I was out of town for this event. Hope we get another chance to acquire this tonic.
---
You have a print screen on your keyboard and GW2 even has an option to assign a different key to a screenshot, but you chose to take a picture with your phone. Had no polaroid camera at hand or canvas to paint it instead ?
---
I'm loving the odd gravity on the tonic, I've always wanted to role-play as a lead balloon
---
What event is that? And what tonic?
---
Boston Tea Party, 1773, colorized
---
Now that's what I call content~
---
From where?
---
The fact that you seen someone else with The same Opinion is a indicative that i'm not alone in this.
---
Well how is raidselling proper lfg? That's trading if anything... If they accept it so openly, they should finally make a tab for it. Oh and a fav list for those tabs, or an ignore button to hide the tabs you never use... Ah that lfg tool is so shiiit -. -
---
Well, great, if we are talking about this specific example - they can point out problems probably perfectly, but I can assure you that their proposed changes or updates, the "right kind of support", all of that would kill game faster than what ANet is currently doing. Ask any game developer, and any will agree that players might be great at pointing out flaws, but their proposed solutions suck pretty hard.
---
How? The current grind is COMPLETELY OPTIONAL. It's wouldn't be if I took a break from the game, only to have to grind for new gear if I wanted to play the new raids due to a  gear treadmill.
---
Don't call something out for being ironic and hilarious when you don't even understand what you're replying to. I'm not defending anything about the game, I'm rejecting the idea of introducing a gear treadmill.
---
Wow, I had no idea the hardcore players were exclusively keeping the game afloat!
---
Yeah, and rewrite it every single time. That's just so damn stupid that I don't know what to say.
---
Can a noob like me join?
---
The question was about build changes since last patch not if it's viable (we're running this comp since a couple of months now)
---
You can solo all dungeons, except CoF p1, CoE p123, Arah p1
---
So bold.
---
I don't think NCSOFT is responsible for the biggest mistakes made during the development of GW2.
---
And don't want to admit the game is in a bad state and needs updates to stay relevant
---
I havent found anything. Would you care to explain what you mean by "new mystic forge sink for ectos"?
---
Lovely. You can alter the registry to get 8K working on a 2K (1080p) screen too.
---
he's just a random dude, stop pushing the idea it's mob mentality just to fit your narrative.
---
There's still another week...
---
Race has no impact on class performance.  There are racial elite skills, but they aren't really used in any standard level 80 builds.  The initial quest line is different for each race though.  Go with whichever one you like most!
---
&gt; You're literally complaining that they give us something to do, whereas most other titles don't between expansions - which take (usually) the same 2-3 years to develop. 
---
They barely give us anything, and it's definitely not worth the production cost.
---
Those other games survive droughts far better because the content they release lasts for months.
---
You are a zombie alright.
---
WHM is the one class that puts me to sleep even as a veteran player, so that may be one reason why.
---
Genuinely curious what miracle MMO's don't have a sub fee and don't nickle and dime you.
---
LOOT!
---
And PoF went dead few weeks after release, so what's your point? This isn't a single player game.
---
works great for me so far https://i.imgur.com/CrRg8ht.png
---
Sylvari. I've just never been able to get into the whole "plant person" aesthetic.
---
...tho I did once try to make a Sylvari Ranger named Salad Shooter. Name was unavailable. :(
---
I think anet is lost in what direction to take next, they made content that Dont fit in the comuny model they had (exclusive rather than inclusive), to apeal wow players?
---
They continue in this path, that create a huge gap between new/casual players and "hardcore"(mostly Kids) /veteran players.
---
Its sad. But its good that other New mmos are learning and making better, i'll check out ff14.
---
Chrono is still alright in PvE. Don't use it in PvP game modes.
---
Mirage is fine for sPvP, and WvW roaming.
---
The only content mesmer really has no purpose in right now is WvW zerging. For that you kind of need a guardian (firebrand), engineer (scrapper), necro (scorge), revenant (all are okay), or ele (all are okay if you're a god)
---
FB has always been able to do it with Tome f1 and axe 3
---
My, how the turns have tabled
---
Everything works in open world because its brain dead easy
---
It was already a high burst dps—which is meta in fractals—it got a fairly sizable increase in its burst and general dps. So overall, they took a meta build and made it more meta.
---
seems like a copypasta because you have a Very Random Way of capitalizaing Random Words
---
FoFW should be coming.
---
You fight him back with facts, facts about the future of our game, facts we don't have.
---
You can keep shilling across the whole thread forever, reality stands as it is, and shitty excuses won't solve anything; in any case, they might make everything worse.
---
You'll get enough hero points through the game to unlock all of the specializations.  You can't unlock the elite specializations until after you've completely unlocked the core ones.  You can also change which specializations and traits your build currently uses any time when not in combat.  So don't agonize over which ones to unlock and in what order!
---
It's the same level of rude like telling a raging person to judt calm down. Where we at the point again... It's a very good advice and not meant to be understood as offensive. (Well you're right. It is usually understood offensive at the end)
---
I like dungeons for what they are,  but I have no problem with fractals getting the attention.  It's just content that needs attention.  An expansion needs to include a bunch (8-12) of them and that's never going to happen and it makes me sad.
---
Its the autocorrect, i'm From a non english speaking country and i had to fight autocorrect all the time (Also it thinks every "the" should be capitalized).
---
No, you need PoF to play it, not to obtain it by logging in
---
Everything of arah except path 1 is soloable without abusing any bug.
---
The easiest is cm p3 by far. SE p1 isn't that hard either.
---
Would say the easiest to solo are cm p3, honor of the waves p1, ascalon p3, SE p1
---
Would say ta up and fw are medium to solo. Ascalon p1 and p2 are very tricky but can be done.
---
All the stories can be solo'd but CoE is quite hard and the Honor of the Waves Story endboss is probably the hardest boss to solo in the game.
---
Someone who doesn't play the game in the first place, that's for sure.
---
AND 3
---
Ahaha!! Migrating to ff14 because anet caters to new players?! AHAHA! Have you played ff14 like ever? The end game is literally holding hands in duty finder for tomestones.
---
Yeah, the people saying it takes hundreds of hours are just bitter and pushing an agenda. It only takes a few hours to level up if you really knuckle down and just do it instead of complaining the whole time. Skip cutscenes, spam quicktravel, and get it done.
---
Woah can you tell me what all of those pieces are?
---
Largos use the norn/human/sylvari rig as well, and pretty much all armor sets would work well with them with barely any effort at all.
---
Oh, it's not about having trouble with the open world. It's about QoL and the loss of gameplay. That one stupid grawl that shot an arrow at you while you're swinging your sickle at that cluster of herbs? Now he's going to put you into combat. Being able to be a little less high strung because you can just pop an invul for a short time, so that hard hitting skill is a bit less of a threat to you? Gone. Triple-blinking through the lava and finishing it up with a second of invuln? Nope! Fuck you! Proccing a few traps without getting clobbered? Nuh-uh! Rezzing that guy in a high damage AoE field? Better get your clones up and infight! Can't dodge that hydra meteor anymore? Well sucks, that third one will get you now! Berry farm? Spend ALL the hours in combat!
---
It's the little things that add up. No, it didn't break the class for open world. Of course not. It just sucks now a bit more to play it. New players will never know better though.
---
Although I don't know why someone would play Chronomancer for open world content, Power Mirage is superior in every way. But then again, my priorities are mobility, the capability to GTFO and spend as little time in combat as needed so I can move the fuck on instead of having to fight every shitty little mob between here and the straits of africa while I'm farming iron.
---
Dude, it's literally *never* been a good "new player experience". Even back when it was a squad shooter.
---
They can always be reforged. [Just an idea...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cfjxax/guild_wars_2_the_calm_and_the_storm_living_world/)
---
The real endgame content! Who needs raids and dungeons when you have this!
---
No worries, it's often not easy to see when it's presented in written from.
---
Same here, there's a lot of potential there. This game does underground very well, it's one of its strongest points.
---
You mean you can’t just *mimic* a meme?
---
Lmao nice lie. I said there's no point for me continuing trying on a game that already has a gameplay i don't like, and if the gameplay changes only after you paid without even giving it a try (even though the system is the same) then why would i pay? -.-
---
[Here's a good video about Path of Exile "game as a service" design.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pM_5S55jUzk )

What ever happened to drops? Remember when the gold storm bow dropped and everyone shit themselves. Those were reasons to play content, knowing you might stumble upon something t.
---
People on forum dismiss these kinda concerns so quick I'm just glad it's actually being talked about here.

Festival Wars 2
---
For WvW, if you're talking havoc/roaming/small scale fights, LB does alright now. Between 1500 range trueshot (which hits pretty hard), deflecting shot's damage buff, and buff to symbol of energy's projectile speed, coupled with most other things being nerfed relative to guard/DH, I'd say you're in a pretty good spot right now. For larger scale fights, or if you're running in an organized group, it's better to be running a front-line or support guard, but if you REALLY want to run LB for the memes, I recommend running something glassy so you can rely on trueshot crits to nearly 1-shot people.
---
If you want a little more survivability and ability in wvw as well as over you may like marauder more than zerk
---
Of course there are, only the most passionate actually announce they're leaving. The rest just forget about the game one day and no longer log in.
---
The lack of socialization usually translates to people having no friends, leading to even less reasons to return.
---
As a returning casual player. Can someone please explain to me?
---
Wing cosmetics are for basic bitches, lite brite glowy particle effects are for people who try to hard to be cool and black/skull cosmetics are for edge boys.
---
GW2 does have a dodge key, though...?
---
Doesn't it end today? I keep hearing it ends today.
---
"Just leave :)"
---
Truly inspiring! How could I have been so blind before, your kind words opened my eyes. Now I just cannot help myself but change my likes and dislikes more akin to your revolutionizing views.

All festivals that got a 50/1000 title are not automatically recurring, whether they add new shinnies in the loot boxes or vendors or not:
---
* New Year's Customs
---
* Super Adventure Box: Nostalgia
---
* Dragon Bash Feats
---
* Halloween Rituals
---
* Wintersday Traditions
---
Right now, all festivals yearly categories have a 50/1000 achievement except Four Winds Customs. 
---
Based on previous experiences, it'll be weird if it didn't. 
---
Considering they also made a Norn festival, it would not be surprising if they also made a Charr festival (either Meatoberfest or Olmakhan homecoming) and a Sylvari one (moving Wintersday to the Grove, or Pale Mother's day sometime in May)
---
Ah haven't logged in since last night. T5 wasn't complete last night when I logged off.
---
Pretty simple. The endgame has stagnated, so veterans are becoming increasingly disillusioned and frustrated. As a casual and new player this won't affect you for a good long while.
---
Yup. I can't even be fucked to do the skyscale.
---
At least WoW makes most of the collections relatively easy and with fewer timegates, so it feels satisfying. But nothing in the latest expac feels satisfying, and I can't think of anything I want to do (that I'm willing to make the effort for) in GW2.
---
MMO's are just in a rough state in general right now.
---
There's generally a pretty decent reason *why* people say it though.
---
The no brainer is that the game is story driven. It always has been, and it's always been a concern that it was going to be a barrier even when Heavensward was about to come out and Yoshi held his stance of "You need to finish all of the ARR content first.".
---
The second, is comparing XIV to the likes of Warcraft in terms of an endgame scene, there's less high end content to keep people occupied. Dungeon content has always been pretty easy, Raids can be difficult, and the hardest part of the 24-man Alliance raids is making sure you have more people that can do simple mechanics over those who can't, and we don't really mention the PvP.
---
If you don't like the story, that's fine, but you'll find the content hidden behind that probably isn't going to be enough to keep you occupied unless you really like leveling alts or crafting.
---
Hell, I was a cutscene and dialogue skipper for most of ARR because it was hilariously boring, but with Heavensward I made myself watch and read all of it and actually found myself enjoying it and caring about what I was doing.
---
Fast forward to Stormblood, I got a few levels in, absolutely hated the story, quit for a year and a bit, and came back to catch up for Shadowbringers. But in that catch up, I did actually skip most of the Stormblood MSQ. I can't say I regret it, but the catchup didn't feel that long because of it.
---
People saying that the game isn't for you if you don't like the story aren't just trying to tilt you, it's a pretty genuine warning. It's similar to what we used to deal with here in the first year of GW2 when everyone was bashing it for the lack of traditional endgame. If that's what you looked for, GW2 probably wasn't going to be for you.
---
All are welcome ^^
---
I haven't done it myself, so I'd rather not give you wrong info. You can find plenty of guides about it on YouTube, though.
---
Been testing [this build for the past week](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vdAQFASnUUBtpitoC+ZBsehlRki+Jzyw87UWlWBsWylAA-jhBBABBcBAqU9n80BcmSQAeAAYt/o8DA-e), strictly in non-group content. Clocks around 9-10k with solo buffs, which is what I look for in an open world build. I'm not an expert in designing rotations, but for this one, focus on getting off Blast and Leap finishers to maintain superspeed, e.g. Big ol Bomb into Spare Capacitor, Fire Bomb into Rocket Charge, Shredder Gyro into Blast Gyro, etc. Your primary source of damage is Shredder Gyro, followed by hammer auto-attack. Use Electro-whirl off cooldown, and save Rocket Charge for when there is a combo field available, such as when Thunderclap is available; Shock Shield is only used to block attacks.
---
&gt; it always seems like there is a great deal of strife for things I don’t understand
---
The issues lie in parts of the game that haven't experienced yet.
---
Yeah I think doing nothing and bitching about it would be more satisfying.  Oh well.
---
Not going to click that since June 30 was almost a month ago, nice try
---
I'll just go ahead and report this multiple times &gt;.&gt;
---
Surely one set of dailies wouldn't hurt anything ...
---
Not visible. Also... June?! Wat?!
---
The fact that this was from the LA Times made it really obvious that something was off here
---
Thanks.
---
What would be the point of that?
---
Yeah same. I was worried we wouldn’t make it, but the SEA folks musta pulled through for us!
---
When Anet says they are in devlopment of Alliances and years later they basically make no real headway, what do you call that exactly. You have people who regulrly play the game asking for actual updates and improvements to the balancing and instead they get a mount. When HoT releases the devs said they could possibly do 6 wings a year in actuality we get one every 9 months. Anet creates legendary armor that has less quality than a gem store outfit and has straight gone silent on even improving the dye channels to even be comparable to recent gem costumes. They say they are going to work on being transparent and work on QoL upgrades for the game but not a single post has been made since then about any of that in multiple months. But thats ok none of those things are promises afterall you should just accept whats here...or leave.
---
That's the point, ff14 doesn't even have a basic mechanic of a game which is avoiding damage that isn't simply "run away because hurts"
---
They have just started leaving. How, exactly, do you know they are leaving for good?
---
I'll answer that: you don't. Just more 'doom and gloom' rhetoric.
---
I still don't know what you're talking about. My class in FF14 has about 24 skills that I have to alternate using twice between each 2.5s GCD and 3-4 dodge abilities that cover a large distance.
---
Meanwhile in Gw2 I have 15 total abilities and 3 class features and about 8 of those have a 30-120 second cooldown. It seems faster because you're frantically running around all over trying to avoid glitchy poorly animated death zones but in reality you're just hitting the same 6-ish buttons while waiting for mechanics and long cooldown burst windows to happen. 
---
I'm not saying either is better because they're both trash for different reasons, but if I was going to critique the quality of gameplay I wouldn't be playing a hotkey MMORPG. I'd be playing like....... Dark Souls or something.
---
Oh, shit! Sorry. I read your statement backwards, as if GW2 didn't. I gotcha now.
---
I'd hazard a guess that he meant before they actually made it easily soloable.
---
GW2's gear approach would be much more tolerable than WoW's if it had a higher output of cosmetics. But it doesn't.
---
I don't like WoW's approach. But I'm tired of GW2 padding the length of skin acquisition in ways that just aren't fun.
---
I had a better post where I laid out how and why GW2 is the way it is with cosmetics, but it got eaten and I don't want to retype it on my phone.
---
Why would they move wintersday, a human holiday, to the grove?
---
I wanna see the video replay on this one lol. Presumably, one point was decapped even for a second, or one team won the cap finally, and the game is in sudden death at that point.
---
Using GW2 and hardcore in the same sentence.  Omegalul
---
I actually pay more in gem purchases than I do in a sub fee, but I refuse to pay the sub because it's just not worth it to me to have to pay again and again for a game I already paid for upfront. Im not paying more money each month just to continue doing HoT metas or the current 7 raid wings.
---
I think GW2 is a superior game experience to FF14 even now, so I won't switch. If all the sub fee does is add more end game content, then it's not really worth it to me, and if it locks me out of what I've already been doing I'll just quit MMOs entirely. 
---
And I've been raiding for over a year now. The folks who are experiencing a content draught have just been playing for even longer or are looking for something else in their gaming experience. Some folks have even claimed to be playing more than 8 hours a day. In their cases I'm not surprised they're running out of things to do and I recommend taking a break from GW2 if it's no longer fun. I stand by my opinion that a game should never feel like a job.
---
If you are in your teens/20s though, then I understand that GW2 is going to feel inferior to other options. At that age I was playing old WoW and Eve Online, and I was much more tolerant of the grind. I also played FPS games like Counter Strike and Battlefield 2, because I still had quick enough reaction time to be good at them. I was a much more hardcore gamer at that age. I have no interest in playing any of those games now.
---
That said, I think there is merit to an optional fee, as long as all existing content and new story/maps aren't locked behind it. If I have to pay a monthly fee to play season 5, there's a good chance I don't play it.
---
I’m over super casual gamers saying “ chill” I enjoy it so much you.
---
I play every class and do most of the craft/gather jobs. There is no need for more than the two free retainers because of those things. 
---
I wouldn't mind if they removed some or most of the fetch quests around lvl 50. I've already done them, after all, so it wouldn't affect me either way, and it would make it easier on new players or alts. I don't know how that's related to you thinking that 3+ retainers are somehow necessary and a cash grab, which is completely false.
---
The start of FFXIV is notoriously boring because you have your classes pre-Heavensward are like 2 button rotations and the story is very slow during the ARR era. It improves dramatically when you reach Heavensward because each class becomes much more complicated and engaging and the story is presented much better.   
---
But yeah, the 1-50 wall is something that stops a lot of new players and I don't think any FFXIV blames them. It's something Square needs to address. A shame since ShB is like something everyone should play. It's a masterpiece of a story.
---
Don't confuse the ingame community with this subreddit. This is just a tiny sliver of the actual playerbase. Same for the forum, for that matter.
---
Good job being [this guy](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/021/665/DpQ9YJl.png) when someone uses a very common [meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/commit-sudoku).
---
2.5s global cs vs no autoattack cd
---
single cd on skills vs multiple cd for using 1 skill
---
the point is not an enjoyable gameplay for me. that's it.
---
Depends on what is lots of playtime for you? After 15k hours it is most likely "over". But even than you have not achieved everything but you have most likely done everything more than once. But on the other hand 15k hours is more than most players will ever invest in a game.
---
&gt; canvas to paint it instead 
---
That would actually be amazing.
---
I was messing around with this recently. I really enjoy playing scrapper, and I think I'd really enjoy it more if the 2 skill had half its current cooldown or something, or the gyro F skills were more like active combat abilities than instant cast defensive/utility options.   
---
Anyways, I think the best build for open world is probably alchemy/firearms/scrapper? I was running around with elixir b and elixir u with shredder gyro and tearing shit up most of the time. Scrapper kinda has shit survivability once your cd's run out too so alchemy's passive defensive traits help a lot, and your might uptime is quite good with the power of HGH + juggernaut in firearms, since honestly you're never gonna get that much mileage out of modifier ammunition in open world save for world bosses where your contribution is relatively unimportant anyways. 
---
It is very clearly not a good build for dealing with particularly tanky mobs and your combat effectiveness is hard gated by your hammer cd's, but it's really fun for just ""doing"" open world content. Packs a shitton of CC too, with all the lightning fields + hammer 3.

---
Again, how do you know they won't come back?
---
Again, you don't. People take breaks and 'quit' MMOs all the time. Nothing new.
---
Enough to take your time to comment on it and then even reply to another comment on the same subject.
---
no.
---
lol dead game
---
I solo'd 2 draenor raids earlier in about 2 hours, and made 4k gold off the items. Overlevelled, obviously.
---
And that 4k will get me fucking nothing. It's gross. The game is in a really bad state right now and I almost regret subbing. The economy is in the tank and there feels like very little to do.
---
The only thing saving it is that it is the only game I feel comfy in. But I'll have my fix by the end of the month. Then I'll try classic I guess. BFA is a shit show.
---
Now if that release page doesn't get you hyped up I don't know what will.
---
It's like the one that wrote that article is dead inside.
---
nice nice. but I hoped for some dev post about the game's future
---
Ye, Chrono is dead in that regard. Becoming friends with Mirage is the only option you got. Case Mesmer is basically a retarded Chrono. I mean, sure, you got your F4 back. But...that's it.
---
But yeah. No-clone tricks are dead, Phantasm tricks are dead, Mimic tricks are dead, Arcane Thievery/SoI tricks are dead. Overdesigned pile of clunky mechanics is all that's left.
---
Honestly I think WoW saw a similar decline for that reason. Subs only trickled downward with every expansion following WotLK.
---
Every time someone complained about the increasingly instanced direction the game was taking, they'd be told "then leave." And when they said they would, they got the "you'll be back." Turns out no, they wouldn't be.
---
Brushing people off like that isn't how you keep a community. And every player should give a shit about keeping a community, because what are you doing playing an MMO if you don't give a shit about community?
---
Even on ultra low graphics itd probably crash whenever theres a big blob lol
---
if it's possible to scale events and maps content, it's possible to scale dungeons.
---
Yo, don't compare this to cashiers.
---
The equivalent is more like if McDonalds employees started occupying tables and eating the food and shouting out loud "Mmm, look at how good this food is!", whilst wearing their uniforms.
---
It's cringe, yo
---
And don't you forget that we may have Queen's Jubilee to look forward to as well! And then Halloween! And then Wintersday!
---
:|
---
Been on both sides of such matches. On side feels great. Other side is watching the obvious win go away each second panicking trying to get the last stupid point(s) while watching the other team catch in disbelief.
---
&gt; Just like HoT being a paid expansion instead of a Living World Season was a sign the game was ending.
---
I head nothing but great praise that ArenaNet was finally releasing an expansion. I didn't hear anything saying a paid expansion was a bad thing. In fact, most people were relieved that SOMETHING was happening.
---
&gt; certain people complaining can't see any reason to keep playing.
---
Maybe they should just *[SHOCKING][IN THE HOOD][MEMES][OBAMA SHOWS UP]* take a break
---
Titania isn’t really hard? Ex is but that’s both optional, and the entire idea behind ex
---
Why do I do this to myself lol. I was hoping we would get some form of communication from Anet today about the actual game. Of course it's gem store stuff why am I so stupid.
---
I can only think (optimistically) that they keep buying time because they're trying to cook something big in the background.
---
But thinking that will probably lead to disappointment.
---
Arah p1 has been done with 3, CoE also only needs 2 players for the consoles :)
---
Season 5 ep 1 will release at september most likely, anything before is being delusional knowing anet's release times at this point, meanwhile more reused stagnant useless "content".
---
The fact that they haven't said a single word too makes it worse.
---
You have described advertisements. Well done
---
To be fair, that's not the release page
---
The release page will look more like [this](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/july-24-2018/)

Its actually a daily limit of 100 chests, i guess this was to stop bots farming them.

---
&gt; If literally everything in the game Angers you, maybe it's time to take a break
---
Can confirm, worked for me.
---
I run Cms+t4s+recs, and get 40g + mats i don't sell + drops i don't sell, and i'm only prodigy (tbh i don't know if getting god is worth it, but i'll get champion soon)
---
50-60 g isn't that much of a stretch.
---
This takes 1 to 1.5 hours depending on how competent the DPS are (we run firebrigade with a friend and some times another friend joins with bs).
---
 Play the ~~TP~~  game
---
It looks like they are trying to coast on the festivals and events as content padding to get through to the same minimal Living World releases. Now is definitely the time to move onto a new MMO like FF14 if you were hoping 2019 would be better than 2018 for GW2.
---
Queen's Jubilee is bundled together with the festival now, at least.
---
Gem store, that's what's going on
---
Advertisements don't physically sit in the tables that are meant for customers.
---
If it as to be casual to avoid toxic people, so be it.
---
Wierd that i managed to get even 4 upvotes because this sub defended the mounts to the death for some reason, the game just isn't fun for me anymore and it makes me very sad.
---
Hey guys, if you don't like the Festival of the Four Winds just play something else.
---
Arah p2 is fun to solo. Used to sell it in the day.
---
OMEGALUL you were right
---
&gt;That's actually pretty unheard of.
---
Not really?
---
&gt;Any thoughts on what's going on?
---
Summer?
---
Festival of the Four Rehashes Returns ... again.
---
what class are u running? most professions have a trait that boosts movement speed by 25%, and others have leaps and teleports to help umove faster
---
The lag is gone now
---
Makes me think they will release the episode 1st of Season 5 in September...
---
As a WvW player, the whole game is painful.
---
You are exactly four weeks late, my friend. During dragon bash you could have earned a total of roughly 300-1000 g by simply doing ten minutes dailys every day. Depends on when you would have sold your stuff.
---
Oh well then don't I feel silly. I was kind of dreading the announcement of yet another festival so soon.
---
So I need to be the expert and an incredible player to do the content?
---
I want to play just that, not spend 12 hours day training to be awesome in the game. For example: for leveling you need to be awesome? No... you can play, casually and you can get level 80. Other example: you can be a terrible player and do dungeons and raid with a group. Will it be complicated? yea! but you can.
---
I know the skills, traits, etc, but I'm not the best player in the world. I know combos, but not every combo, I know the weapons, etc, but I'm not the kind of player who know every cooldown or remember when a trait it's start.
---
It's almost like it was announced as an annual festival.
---
Hmmm...
---
Yea I think so
---
Nah, they think Living World is a longterm strategy to keep the game fresh in place of expansions every two years like their competitors.
---
Season 5 will either have the same shallow content you burn through in four hours, or it will have much larger delays between releases. GW2's best days are behind it.
---
Don't worry there will be like 5 new ugly skins.
---
But it is much exciting, very wow! Who needs content when you can have chairs?
---
When there are no people available, what happens then? I understand the concept of multiplayer, but it can't hold me back.
---
How do you link your whole profile? I'd be happy to link you mine and have you tell me what great "content" I missed out on. I already held on longer than I actually had fun until I recently quit because I played "repeatable" content quite a bit.
---
That would be weird considering the Festival of the Four Winds includes the primary content from the Queen's Jubilee - the Crown Pavilion.
---
Its funny and sad that the last item I got worth more than a few gold was an Arthropoda, a few years ago.  I think I sold it for around 100g.  Since then, nothing but rares and a few exotics worth maybe 2g.  I guess I should mention I also only WvW now when I actually play so getting anything worth more than a few copper is a shock.
---
CoF story is definitely soloable. One of the times the daily was up I did it up to the boss before putting up a LFG for it.
---
CoE story is also soloable. There is also a map break that lets you pretty much skip the whole thing except for the fight with the first group.
---
That wasn't my personal experience in game. And my personal experience is really all I can speak to.
---
✈✈✈✈ DID ANYONE ORDER CARPET DRAMABOMBING? ✈✈✈✈
---
Banned builds seem weird.
---
CI and elite signet are both banned, power mirages are lucky. Also, Support Firebrand is banned but neither Signet of Mercy nor Transfusion (in necro) is, haha.
---
It's not that easy and there are plenty of mechanics requiring different players doing different stuff ( for example the consoles to activate in Fractals ).
---
Also, you'd need to re-design every reward system for that or else it would destroy the purpose of the game being, well, an MMo.
---
You're asking it out of total personal interest, wanting the game to be adapt on your personal needs, not for the sake of the game in general which is built and designed for multiplayer content.
---
Content
---
Not all sub fees weigh heavily on the one paying, and you give a good example.
---
If I was paying a sub fee for Netflix or anything like that, then yes there is a sense of obligation to get your money's worth, but the threshold is lower. The time commitment is also less. 
---
I don't pay a sub for most movies, opting to buy them instead. But as long as I watch a wide enough variety of movies a sub fee would be cheaper financially. I can accept the merits of a sub fee in this context.
---
What I wouldn't tolerate is buying a movie and then being told I also have to pay a sub fee to continue watching it after I already own it. The sub fee doesn't make sense to me for a video game because you're paying to play a game you already paid for. If I had to pay a monthly sub fee to watch movies I already purchased I would be upset with that too.
---
I don't pay sub fees for Minecraft, Terraria, Stardew Valley, Banished, Skyrim, the Witcher 3, or Mount &amp;amp; Blade. Those are the sort of games I normally consider worth playing, and what I compare all other games to. I pay once to buy them, again if there's an expansion, and thereafter should be able to enjoy them without additional purchases. In the case of GW2 I'm even willing to buy gems because I like the stuff in the cash shop. When I buy gems it doesn't feel like I'm paying for the game itself, but for something that'll make my gaming experience even more enjoyable.
---
I probably spend more in gems than if there was a sub fee. It's less about the cost and more about that sense of obligation. I wouldn't pay a sub fee for FF14, because it's a commitment to the grind at a time in my life where I just want to log in for two hours and then log out until the next day. Yet folks are claiming it's an even better gaming experience than GW2. That makes me feel like paying a sub fee for GW2 isn't worth it.
---
I think it's fair to say these games are targeting different audiences. If you're willing to pay a sub fee then you're already playing FF14 or WoW. Maybe GW2 could implement an optional sub fee with bonus raid content for that market, but for the rest keep the current system. Outside of that, though, I see lots of folks quitting MMOs entirely.
---
Join a guild, make friends that want to do the content.  If I was online now I'd play with ya
---
I mean, I've been here since HoT dropped and I am still overwhelmed with everything I have to accomplish.
---
Anet promised more communication following the layoffs and we got some communication in the 1-2 months that followed but now they are back to old Anet: silent.  No info on LS5, expansion, future raid/fractal releases, WvW alliance update, PvP update, nothing nada zilch.  Anet, for some reason, thinks that keeping silent and saying absolutely nothing is better than saying anything at all.  They have a head in sand approach when it comes to this game.
---
# FURNACE TAKEN!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Can someone elaborate the rush of negativity surrounding this?
---
**Half** the player base you say eh?
---
I'm glad we get festivals now instead of like pre-HoT where there was literally nothing but this doesn't excite me like I thought it would.  Recycled content in this game is getting more and more tiresome.  The only hype revolving around the game anymore is waiting for them to release the stuff like build templates outlined after the layoffs.
---
Might as well delay that a month to avoid competing with classic WoW (August 28).
---
But then it'd collide with Halloween so let's do Halloween first.
---
Why rush things if Wintersday is right around the corner tho? 
---
Get hyped for January
---
They did try very hard to promote PvP with the aspiration of making it an esport but it didn't work out as they hoped. Tournaments were manually generated and publicized. Since that effort flopped they created the automatic tournaments. Say what you will about the current state, but it wasn't a lack of effort by any means.
---
I managed to avoid those nasty little pocket raptors by using the skyscale. Cheating perhaps, but it was fun nonetheless!
---
That's just one topic. We have had plenty of Refugee coming from X. I've seen multiple WoW refugee, Bless Online refugee, etc posts. It really doesn't mean anything. FF14 is just in a hot place atm. I always wonder what content people want when they ask for it? Dungeons? Raids? PvP? WvW? I don't think Anet can ever deliver what some people expect tbh.
---
no
---
They are so proud of the tech designed for sitting in chairs.  I can't believe they are actually still going through with more skins for chairs...CHAIRS.
---
Look up the reddit posts during the pre and post hot era. It can get worse.
---
I can't speak for WoW since I saw the game getting dumbed down with the release of WotLK and my own guild told me to quit if I didn't like it. So I did. Seems like I was right but it took many more expansions for everyone to think it went too far.
---
Guild focused and community driven content.  
---
I've got a post coming addressing this, but I'm taking my time with it.  GW2's difficulty progression curve has been broken  foryears because players aren't building important communication, teamwork and gameplay standards that they need to transition into other gameplay modes (Raids, Fractals, sPVP, WvW).  Open World breeds players with weak fundamentals that are slow to adapt, slow to perform and slow to communicate; and in an GW2...? That's considered "okay." 
---
* Simply put, the game doesn't ask you value mechanics that are used in other parts of the game... 
---
* Guild Missions are basically "easy mode" raids and are in a constant state of neglect / weak difficulty progression.  The game should be adding more guild missions with simple, modern, intuitive and cooperation/teamwork focused mechanics.  
---
* Players aren't learning gameplay fundamentals or problem-solving skills to tackle harder or more varied content.  
---
* GW2 has very little over-arching community integration; no reason to care about PvE, sPVP, WvW communities etc. 
---
* I was considering a "Global Reward Track" / Monthly Achievements / used to push a [competitive flux](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Flux) or PVE event; dungeon/fractal/raid boost or a world boss rush; something different or fun w/ a varied rotation.  I don't think that "Call of the Mists" and it's step-brother are sufficient; they're passive boosts and ArenaNet can do better. 
---
Some of us are thinking about actual suggestions, but differences of opinion and casual toxicity are a thing when you've got people l strolling around and preaching their gospel about how how anything other than open world PvE is an abomination.
---
You're being fascitious which shows me you have no interest in earnest dialogue, but I'll respond anyway, and you won't like it. You're right.
---
You could say the GoT browser game is the best ever, you could also say lag somehow makes a game better. would those be common or popular opinions? Absolutely not. I'd personally find both statements wild and shocking. But if that individual genuinely believes that, it is their subjective truth.
---
I think your issue is you conflate popularity of an idea with how real or true it is, and that's wrong, simply put. You can not run an experiment to measure the units of "fun" or the units of "good game" in a product. You can not run a test to sit there and quantify the units of goodness contained in a game systems. It's all based off taste.
---
Is there a game genre you simply do not like? Maybe it's RTS, maybe it's platformers, maybe it's 'walking simulators'. If you have a genre you don't like, you HATE playing them, that's subjective. Just as your beliefs surrounding GW2. I also find your gatekeeping hilarious, that someone must prove they're qualified to hold an opinion.
---
So, I genuinely do hope you consider this, because ironically, you're objectively wrong about what is objectively right. You're conflateing your personal biases and tastes with objective truth and that's only going to make people dislike talking to you, and get you in petty arguements that you will never win, because nothing you think about your favorite game is objective. You may hold a popular opinion, but that doens't make it an objectively true fact.
---
Another way to put it, actually, that is better than my last example. Is there a game or movie or show...maybe a song, any piece of media you love that is widely disliked? a "guilty pleasure" piece of media perhaps? Subjective.
---
Or another example. I assume you care about connection consistancy, yes? Frame rates perhaps? Maybe you feel also that the resolution is an important factor for a game to push. That's fine. But also entirely subjective. There's millions of casual gamers that don't think FPS resolution or hell, sometimes even high speed connections actually matter. For me personally I know I care about FPS and connection, but I couldn't give a toss about 4k or anything at all. That's my valid opinion, just as someone who does care has an equally valid one as it's subjective.
---
Hell, let's tie this back to GW2, This game runs on DX9, that makes it wildly unstable and it has a lot of FPS problems thanks to that. in comments even included in this very thread you can see some people saying that HAS to change for the betterment of the game, and others saying it doesn't matter or bother them and it's not something they care if it's done or not. If you believe so truly that you hold objective truths in your opinions, how do you reconcile this?
---
Enjoyment derived from media is not an objective thing. And well, I'm honestly not sure how many more examples I can show you to make you understand this. Again, I want to reiterate, I am in no way, shape, or form saying you're wrong for believing GW2 has the best combat, or best anything, maybe even you think it's the best game ever made, it doesn't matter, if you think that, then that is absolutely acceptable. What I AM saying is you need to accept that's an opinion, it's subjective, and you need to accept that not everyone thinks like you, or has the same tastes as you.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined.
---
I'm sure everyone's got their definition of what that entails
---
Personally, I would say its any mix of these:
---
-Engages in challenging instance content regularly (Raid/CM T4s/Dungeons)
---
-Engages in both PvP and PvE formats regularly
---
-Engages in optimized farming/TP trading regularly
---
-Likely spends 15+ hours a week ingame
---
-Likely has multiple accounts that see use beyond login rewards
---
There's also its own subcategories of "Hardcore PvPer" (those who are Plat2 and up regularly, often does in-house/scrims, has and organizes an AT team, ect) and Hardcore WvWers, but this is just how I see it.
---
The current state of this subreddit seems to be that everything that isn't the official announcement of an expansion coming in 2 months is the worst thing ever and should be complained about.
---
I find this dishonest, just because it is entertainment doesn't mean you can't find it meaningful. Determination, skill, friendship, teamwork, a game can convey all of these and more and lead too a meaningful experience.
---
Process of elimination.
---
If we were to move a festival from a city that has 3 instead making a new one, the Festival of the Four winds can't be it because it requires the Gauntlet, which is in DR.  
---
Canthan New Year would make more sense if moved to a Tengu city if they ever become playable, since most Tengu in the Dominion of Winds are from Cantha and share a few of the Canthan traditions that Canthan humans also had.
---
That leaves Wintersday as the only one of the three that could be moved to the Grove. 
---
It's also the only festival that can have a decent lore explanation: 
---
*  Sylvari never get to experience being kids, and Wintersday is all about Toys and kids and having childish fun. So it would make sense for them to be attracted to the experience of childish play.
---
* Wintersday used to be a festival about Grenth and Dwayna, but the gods are gone now. Knowing the news about the gods, it would not be impossible for the Queen to reconsider hosting a festival that would remind her subjects that the gods are gone, when it can still happen somewhere where it may be less of a reminder, and people can still have their fun. 
---
* And of course, Tixx took over Wintersday and shared it with all races and LA, making it no longer a mostly human festival. He eventually settled in DR because they were the ones the most interested in it, meaning the most willing to pay the bills. But he should be fine with bringing it somewhere else, as long as he gets to do his toy experiments and spreading his cheer and all that stuff, and someone pays the bills. 
---
* DR doesn't have infinite money. 3 festivals may be a tad too much to pay for. So they should not be against having someone else take over the financial burden of one of them, as long as there's portals in the city allowing people to visit it quickly, like we already have for all festivals. 
---
* Even if the festival isn't Wintersday, it would do good for the Sylvari to have their own festival. To bring in some Tourism, and also improve their PR image after the whole Mordrem thing. Seing a bunch of Sylvari acting like kids should help alleviate doubts about them being dragon minions. 
---
* A now Crystalline Caithe could be a decent hostess for the festival, with all the sparkly bits all over her that kind of look like ice diamonds.
---
* And the cheer and positive energy may help with the Pale Tree's recovery. 
---
So it could make sense for the Grove, DR, Tixx and Zommoros to strike the deal . Wintersday is moved to the Grove, along all of its attractions inside the Infininarium and the Mystic Forge (The jumping puzzle, choir Bell and Snowball fights happen inside the mystic forge, after all).
---
Gem store is the most updating "content", lol.
---
Well it was more like ...
---
Before release: WE WANT AN EXPANSION
---
After experiencing the expansion: WE DIDN'T ASK FOR THIS
---
and then ANet had to "waste" a lot of time fixing things instead of working on LS3 or PoF
---
I never understood how chairs ever became a thing. It’s basically a joke of it self.
---
&gt;For example: you're saying that every skin you've unlocked in GW2 has no value to you if you don't use it, yet in FFXIV all of the unlocks have value even if you don't use them?
---
Never did I claim the unlocks have value in FFXIV; I have plenty of skins I don't use in that game, too, that I consider having no value. My point being is that GW2's wealth-collection isn't 'more valuable', I disagree with the OP's implication. At best, XIV provides a better wealth-collection experience, but at worst it does no better or no worse than GW2. Just because I say GW2 doesn't, doesn't mean that I am also saying FFXIV does.
---
I don't know why you're saying I've convinced myself of something and am trying to defend it, when all I'm doing is stating my disagreement with OP's notion that GW2's goal treadmill is somehow distinct from other games just because it's not about increasing iLvl, or that other games focus only on increasing iLv in their treadmill and isn't doing things similar to GW2.
---
My disagreement to the OP extends into their statement about how GW2's economy is balanced. IMO, GW2's economy is a lot more tilted compared to a lot of games just precisely because almost everything non-account-bound can be tied to gold (and thus into gem sales). As a result, you get a lot more gem-focused design for monetization/rewards in-game, with the occasional account-bound collection released for a set of weapons/armor. 
---
I can eventually get a lot of the things I might want in GW2 by just doing anything in game, sure, but meaningful progress is really slow and that is how it falls out -- getting a t6 mat should be exciting, but it really isn't. You always need a good amount of it, but you don't get enough. Needing thousands of a material to make a thing is the norm because of how devalued t5 mats are. You're showered in a lot of gear that you wouldn't ever use, and are meant to be converted to mats/silver which is very small progress towards things you want.
---
I mean Launch was hype and we'll never see those populations again, for those players the game did die...
---
So of course, game won't die, it'll just stagnate and get smaller. This doesn't have to be the case, we now know games like FFXIV and ESO are picking up players year after year whilst GW2 is losing them. 
---
It's not so much dying being an immediate drop in players (although that is present in endgame communities as well) but the downward trajectory. 
---
Now, expansions have been able to bring players back into the game and spike interest in it. If season 5 was expansion 3 there'd be no talk of death or stagnation because we'd be expecting an influx of players. But here we are, with no knowledge of the future and people are thinking there's not going to be anything left.
---
Given that the previous episode launched in the middle of May, mid-August was the earliest possible launch date even before the lay-offs (and considering that the gap between seasons would probably be slightly longer).
---
I like a lot of the stuff gw2 offers but the only reason I really stuck around was my raid group. I only raided once a week for 2-3 hours, but that kept me playing at least for content patches and the expansions. The reward structure of the game, the one thing that would really keep me consistently playing (not a few hours every 3 months and 2-3 hours a week otherwise) is real horizontal progression. The reality is that they don't have much horizontal progression. (I am talking things like elite specs, more skills, more weapons, ect) Cosmetics are not horizontal progression as they don't impact gameplay. I didn't mind working towards cosmetics for a while, but once you have a certain amount they just start to feel pointless. It doesn't help that probably 75%+ of the cosmetic offerings are on the shop.
---
It doesn't help that most rewards in the game are based almost entirely on grinding gold and some kind of account bound gated material that is super easy to get. I think it is a huge problem that people just expect to be able to get every reward because nothing, minus a handful of things like raid cosmetics and cm fractal cosmetics, is something that feels challenging to get. A giant time commitment is not a challenge; it's a giant time commitment. It should be okay for there to be rewards that are unattainable if you cannot complete certain challenges.
---
Guild Wars 2, my favorite MMORPG that I never play.
---
What if the post just says recycled festivals with no new content other than gemstore items, three-four month waits for four hours of story content, and no expansion in the next 12+ months? Would you want that dev post if that's what it said?
---
Every game I know of is moving towards a more open communication policy. They talk candidly about issues, and why they are facing them. Often on a mechanical engine level. This was pioneered buy Early Access games, and expanded into games as a service. It only took them a decade to realize what rhetoricians have known for thousands of years - people have immensely more confidence in you when you can acknowledge a problem, articulate a plan to deal with it, and then demonstrate that steps have been taken in accordance with the plan.
---
gw2 is me waiting for THIEF GREATSWORD
---
More festival, less new content makes subreddit angry
---
Its been a while since the last update, LWS4, and people have been hoping to at least hear something by now. With the festival coming along, many people here are getting frustrated since it means the next release will seemingly get pushed back even further
---
Dont say that to my doctor. :(

[How it feels seeing a new dev blog post: ](https://m.imgur.com/r/reactiongifs/IgMyx)
---
they're preparing to announce thief greatsword obviously
---
I already do that. I joined a guild focused on dungeons, but nobody answers in the chat that wants to do a dungeon / help. Everyone or do PVP, Raids with closed friends or AP.
---
Can I just point out all MMOs recycle content/ideas. Releasing expansions is recycling an idea, releasing raids is recycling ideas, releasing new story is recycling ideas. Yes the content may be new but the ideas are recycled. I do agree with your post but GW2 isn't the first game to recycle content or ideas. Hell festivals in all MMOs are recycled content.
---
You're awesome :)
---
I'm finally getting into it now 6 years after I started playing this game haha. it's pretty fun! and they shower you with rewards.
---
Reddit hivemind at work.
---
Might not even happen this year anymore, they can just chain special events after the festival of the four winds until halloween and then again until wintersday. Also gives them more time to pump out more gemstore skins to make money, which they most likely still desperately need. The big question will just be, if the playerbase will survive this.
---
#CIRCLEJERK OVER, EVERYONE BACK TO "BEST GAME" POSTING MODE
---
Shut up loser, game is in a bad spot but it's not like most devs can do anything about it. Asshole.
---
Aw shit, here we go again
---
*grabs popcorn*
---
imagine the glory that is THIEF GREATSWORD
---
Never said anything about catering to new players just casual players.
---
Realistically its more like
---
A) Release "recycled content" that is very low effort to update while engaging the playerbase for a few weeks
---
B) Release nothing, maintain radio silence until Season 5
---
The studio was and is likely in some serious turmoil from the layoffs. I doubt they had a plan beyond Season 5 at the time, and even if Season 5 was in development, it was no doubt delayed and restructured following the loss of so many employees. I don't think we understand just how disastrous for their workflow the layoffs were.
---
"Festivalitis"
---
There is one festival and special event after another. It gets boring and you "cannot" do normal stuff in the game because you are somehow forced to participate in the festivals for achievements and special stuff.
---
Phew, just as I sold 50 stacks of quartz crystals for 13g/stack!
---
Fast skillful twitchy and mechanically intensive and mobile gameplay compared to the GCD cast while standing inplace locked in animation slog really.
---
A mesmer trying to land burst has 7 button presses in a second, heck, [just look at this fight i had the other day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJQnCyH4a1M&amp;feature=youtu.be), very interactive, twitchy and fast paced, where screwups will get you punished.
---
Ah, the reset trains were killer. Looked forward to this always.
---
What was your character name? I'm curious if I remember as I actively remember almost no names (Just James &amp; a couple others) but usually recognize others when I see them.
---
It's for the sake of the game too my friend.
---
I say this because I already called several friends to play with me, and when I'm not online, except for PVP and WvW, they can't make other content either. Other than that, in another guild, some members also depend on us to help to get on with what they want, maybe help with some achievement, dungeon, raid, etc.
---
Making it possible to play solo is the key to not losing players who don't have friends in game or who play at different time/hour.
---
Yay recycled content.
---
Did I say it was an excuse? The OP asked what is going on. I replied with summer, since it is quite usual for companies to slow down quite a bit during summer.
---
They will likely post an anniversary blog post on Tuesday which is August 27.
---
Was hoping they made some changes to improve it but given the short announcement I’m assuming it’s just the exact same as last year. Maintenance mode it is.
---
Is Mike Z an idiot or is this pressure from NCS? Whoever made the decision to not make another expansion is a raging moron.
---
Loving all the hidden scores in this thread ;-)
---
Can you blame people? Look at WoW and FF14's expansion release schedule - almost exactly every two years. Look at ESO, their releases are like clockwork.
---
GW2 is approaching two years since the last expansion and they haven't even begun S5, which means ArenaNet is not offering the kind of content their competitors (including ESO, which has no sub fee) are offerring to keep players engaged.
---
People want to play GW2 but they don't want recycled festivals and years of Living World. Three years is simply too long.
---
EW GOD NO.
---
Wait for the fanatic Anet fan base (the like only played for a year or two, not the since GW1 launch crowed) come here to downvote you to hell.
---
Man I wish I worked at some of those companies.  I always thought summer was business as usual for companies.
---
i mean it's the table™, and it's filled with possibilities, potential, innovation, hopes and dreams.... yet somehow that cabbage is in control of dealing with it. the image already *is* a meme.
---
Hahah this isn’t high school you scrub.
---
It's funny cuz I have come to the exact same conclusions about scrapper after playing since rework: CDs feel slightly too long to feel good (even just reducing a couple by 1 or 2s would be great), function gyro doesn't feel good, the toolbelt skills are just kinda meh.
---
Glad I'm not the only one.
---
i always just do pvp reward tracks to get the dungeon skins. none of the sitting around waiting for lfg to fill up
---
Thats the case in all T4 fractals. They're endgame but noone treats them like that!
---
You get players with garbage dps who don't know their food, where to buy fractalpostions, how to gear properly and their rotation who can just join your party.
---
They rise from the shitshow that is T3 and want to participate. There is a reason we're looking for killproofs in CMs - to filter underperforming players!
---
I took my time and trained my guildmates, educated them to be of use to us and know a thing or two about other classes too now to talk with them on even ground. But its really frustrating when you get terrybads gamers in your team for normal Fractals, I main Guardian for example - Dragonhunter are one of the noobfriendliest classes there is, you press 6 buttons and get like 70k burst while being extremely tanky. But every now and then you get players with 5k dps on Dgh into your team ... what the fuck!
---
Even the dev tracker is radio silent. It used to have 5-6 comments per day.
---
I like my twitchy fast paced heated duels in Gw2 so FFXIV just sounds like a big bore.
---
You call 1 skill per second fast paced but Mesmers burst is 7 skills in 1 second.
---
This game is literally designed to play alone at this point.
---
Yeah you either breeze through it with a group or cheese mechanics with it solo. If it's designed as group content you'll need a good understanding of the game to be able to complete it solo.
---
Te game totally isn’t for me even if I’m omnicrafter, with ultimate clears, who spend lots of time doing airship stuff because I find it actually fun, who actually plays some PvP because it’s fun even if it’s not the best, 9 pages of minions and over 200 orchestrions. But I don’t like the MSQ, guess I’m not allowed to like the game.

Not sure how it is in the US to be fair, but here in Sweden it is very much slowing down during the summer.

If the guild is not doing what you want it to do then it is not the guild you should be in. There are enough guilds out there for anyone to find their special snowflake. Sometimes you do not hit the right one first thing, then you move on until you do. Don't stay and struggle and get stuck with the feeling that this is what guilds are. Find the one that is right for you.
---
If people buy them, why wouldn't they make more of them? This literally has next to nothing to do with Anet being "proud" of their gemstore items.
---
Also, Dragon Bash wasn't really some amazing festival bringing new stuff and mechanics. It was mostly artists making new mobs models, and 1-2 devs setting a couple of mobs spawn points and waypoints for race and moa race.
---
The fact that we don't have any elite spec leaks by now makes me sad.
---
Actually, the raiding Chronomancer barely changed. Where I’ve found the changes to be most annoying are in open world, because I can’t continuum split outside of combat or use any other shatters without a clone (for example, as a condi cleanse). Feels bad, but still not game breaking. WvW got hit hard though.

you can be in 5 guilds simultaneously. if one guild's activity window doesn't line up with yours, simply look for ppl in the other 4
---
&gt; including ESO, which has no sub fee
---
Well, you can play the game without the ESO Plus, but it provides some considerable advantages, so it would be very surprising to me if the majority of the playerbase doesn't have it. And even if they really don't, they'd still have to pay for all the DLCs inbetween the expansions in order to play them. The overall expansion prices are also higher there than in GW2. In total, they should still have a considerably higher budget.
---
God, screw all of you people!
---
&gt;ANet: Have some free content during this downtime!
---
&gt;GW2 Community: You guys are literally Hitler for not giving us what we want right now!
---
Fuck you all!
---
I just don't get why they kill the game for poeple like me like that, i am still devastated about the inclusion of the warclaw, i just want to play my second favourite game again how i used to.
---
I agree with the general principle of your comment, but I think it should be noted that the only time we've gone more than 4 or so months between LW Episodes is the Great HoT Content Drought - there have been plenty of delays since then, but saying it's usually 8-9 months is needless hyperbole.
---
Also, if the numbers are anything to go by GW2 has actually grown over the last couple years, as quarterly earnings have been consistently better post-PoF than they were post-HoT. It's technically possible that this is due to less players spending more money, but practically speaking more players spending about the same amount of money is more likely. It's almost certain that the playerbase shrinks over time after an expansion releases, but that's pretty standard for MMOs - it would only be noteworthy if that *didn't* happen with GW2.
---
It is not celebrated only by humans anymore.
---
Back in GW1 humans started spreading their festival with other races, starting with norn.
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Three_Wise_Norn
---
250 years have passed after that. And now it's a festival spread by an asura: Tixx.
---
I keep trying to get back into the game because it’s all my family ever plays, but it’s really tough. PoF got me pretty interested for a while, but now I’m back to it just feeling like a chore.
---
I’ve been doing the boss rush event a little, but it just reminds me why I don’t play. Doing the same content for the *nth* time, being rewarded a bunch of junk that I’m just going to salvage into crafting materials that are worth next to nothing on the market or would actually *cost* me money to use for crafting. Even if I did decide to sink money into crafting, I’m largely just getting aesthetic changes and no real change to my capabilities.
---
I'm genuniely shocked at what's happening now. I defended ArenaNet so hard around the time of the layoffs because I believed ArenaNet had a third expansion well underway, that they had learned the lesson from HoT (don't wait too long for an expansion).
---
PoF after S3 was perfect, it could have used a month or two of polish on rewards and more engaging metas, but overall it was fantastic to see PoF two years after HoT, with S3 bridging it.
---
Now we are approaching the two year mark on PoF's release and we know an expansion isn't coming because S5 hasn't even begun.
---
Reminds me of bless online tbh, after the initial shitshow they had a few weeks of communication and it seemed like they were going to fix the game up with what they said...
---
Then they took the money and ran and delivered none of what they spoke about, and remained tight lipped up until the game was scheduled to shut down. 
---
But the act of communication gave players the hope that they'd do better in future and revitalize it. 
---
I think if Anet was really working on the game and wanted to be sincere about it the community would appreciate it and give them some leeway.
---
On the other hand with this no communication strategy nothing short of an expansion could cure these angry veterans.
---
Yeah. Which is a shame, because having a gigantic barrier after stunning and cleaving a bunch of enemies with hammer skills is fuckin sick.
---
What if I'll come and complain that Scourge dps option was completely removed from the game? When scourge sacrificed all support traits and skills, could deal almost the and dmg like other dps classes. Almost.
---
Yet FB, chrono and some other still have an option to be dps, sometimes without sacrificing support!
---
How cool is that?
---
How is it slowing you? You gain xp for everyhting you gather and gold when selling them. There are ofc gathering routes in the internet that you can use. Youtube have a lot of those videos.
---
Meanwhile we got another new chair to AFK in. Priorities.
---
Scores don't reveal in this sub until a comment is 1 hour old and this post isn't even 1 hour old yet
---
It's because the game engineer changed so much they would have to recreate it entirely. 
---
Also much of it is already reused in festivals and in fractals
---
nice BM from that Thranduil guy :D
---
I do like these moments in PVP. If you don't engage in the complaining and the BM, and are able to accept losses without getting salty, PVP is by far the best game mode of GW2.
---
It's weird how much the change to the autologin changed my whole perception on logging into GW2. I used to login pretty religiously but since that change... eh...
---
&gt; Aurene literally just became an elder dragon.,
---
&gt; Bazaar of the Four Winds are literally a cult that worships Aurene.
---
&gt; ANET hasn't indicated there would be new story related to this.
---
I don't think they need to indicate it, there'll be something.  Last Hallowe'en, the first one after Joko's return and subsequent demise, they added some new things to dig into his background and learn more about him.  I have faith that they'll do the same here, even if it might not wind up being a big lead-in to Season Five like people would hope.
---
People will buy anything.  There are other options besides chairs.
---
I actually like the green (well-balanced throughout) and I like the coral (is that electro pink?) but you could probably use a more muted color to match the hair. What's the pants? (I like the little flowers on the hip). They look fine with the tier stuff, which most armor doesn't.  
---
The wings are fine, there's always the types who whine OmG WinGs!!1one and it's worth wearing wings just to annoy their fragile feefees.
---
&gt; which likely means no expansion for another year
---
If it is a season that contains 4 episodes and strictly follows the 3 month cycle. I think it'll be more like 1,5 years or even 2 years.
---
And Mirages are still overtuned in end game pve (or other condi dps are undertuned, whatever) so don't be surprised if Mirages get nerfed in the future.
---
&gt; I don't think they need to indicate it
---
You don't think they need to generate interest?
---
That's not how they will get people to play, They've just announced it and that's it. Some people probably don't even know what it is, Why should they waste their time digging up previous festivals info because the post was incapable of listing some basic features.
---
I don't think there is anyway you can defend that announcement, It didn't tell anyone anything.
---
Next up ryzen2024 post videos of them soloing every fractal, raid, solo capping everything in wvw and climbing to legend in spvp while 1v5ing every match! Come one come all you wont believe your eyes!
---
Yes most stuff can be solo'd but its alot faster with a group.
---
Your entire comment screams ignorance of how any of this works. That's not an insult, by the way.
---
&gt;" Yes, how dare I not know the labor laws in every single country on the planet? "
---
What a straw man. I'm not saying you have to know the labour laws of every single country, I'm saying it's retarded to assume the rest of the world works just like Sweden, a country with a vastly different political history compared to the rest of the western world. 
---
I'm also saying it's pretty ignorant to either A) not know the game is developed in the US. And/or B) not know that the US has some of the worst opportunities for paid vacation leave in the west. If one knew both A and B, a reasonable person would be able to put two and two together and not make the assumption that "summer" is the reason the devs aren't communicating.
---
cOntEnT
---
Because it was something people requested a lot and ANet decided to implement instead of important stuff.
---
Are you calling world boss rush a casual shitshow?
---
I agree that LS2 was very weak.
---
I don't think they care, as long as they can get numbers of newer issues to replace the veterans that decide to leave. I think most of them have already left, given the perceivably lower number of raid lfgs, declining WvW activity numbers, the significantly lower rank requirements to enter top 250 sPvP, etc. 
---
It seems finally those who tried to hang on are now getting vocal because they were so attached to it. The majority left without announcing it because fact is nobody really cares. 
---
I don't think you need to tell people to leave, if they stop enjoying it and their communities are decaying they will inevitably leave, and if they stay they'll find a reason to. 
---
I do criticize what Anet does but at this point it seems a bit absurd. I guess the saner ones left a while ago and those who are left are making a lot of fuss about not playing the game.
---
Well damn way to take away my surprise.
---
Practically speaking, the only changes are that you can no longer use F3 or F4 without clones for a quick Daze or Distortion, and accessing the Distortion effect requires burning a much more valuable resource on a far longer cooldown. Neither of those changes really impact Open World gameplay in any meaningful way, unless you're trying to get super-optimal DPS or something (or usually use your F1 and F2 shatters without clones, which strikes me as a questionable decision).
---
Have you tried Fractals instead of Dungeons?
---
Dungeons are dead content, released at launch and left abandoned.  Fractals are the five-player instanced content that is being pushed now, and it has more players as a result.  You won't have to wait as long to play there.
---
If there are dungeon skins that you want, and you don't like the waiting associated with finding groups for them, you can earn them via PvP or WvW reward tracks.
---
PvP is the true endgame of GW2 if you love its combat system and the only part of it the devs aren't actively trying to suffocate by incompetence.
---
This, a thousand times over. Catering too much to the most vocal, high-end players is a great way to make a game that's inaccessible and unenjoyable to the other 95% of your population, which in turn is a great way to kill said game. Unfortunately, a lot of that 5% for GW2 are heavily focused on PvP, WvW and Raids, which aren't nearly as supported as open-world PvE and story content.
---
It would be enough if people who complain on lack of content just left instead pouring their toxic waste here.
---
Everyone who remain would be capable of constructive criticism.
---
I...its been a whole year already? What happened to the last year?
---
People saying "it's just a minority, the hardcore players" forget that the hardcore players are usually the ones with the top stream views and YouTube channels. 
---
Doesn't matter if they're a "vocal minority", people will be listening to them instead of some casual on map chat of shadow behemoth daily.
---
I realize you got the tiger already, but I had to find this shortcut myself, not doing a challenge or anything. Wow is it sneaky and hidden. But it does skip over everything and spits you out right above the portal.
---
They aren't proud. Chairs are mounts that don't move. It's a lazy way to act like theyre adding new content and not just making do with minimal updates
---
If the bless online devs could fool a good portion of their players into continuing to invest in their broken product by promises of fixes in the future, I'm sure Anet with their actually Good game can do better. They just need to try.
---
Ty for the response! I think I have a few of 'em although not a lot.
---
Yes. 
---
I think most people would then invest time elsewhere for a while.
---
How often do you wanna bring that strawman up? This is no excuse for a company to go radio silent about upcoming things. If anything I doubt people would chimp out when they communicate why certain things were canned.
---
[TF2 did that when they still actively updated](http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=3539). They threw general patch ideas out and when something didnt make it, they had a blog update on why it didnt make it. It was interesting reads and made you understand the devs a little more. Surely thats given devs have the time to relay information to Customer Relationship so they can write a blog.
---
Completely disregarding communication because a few sperglords sperged is not gonna help anyone on the long run. If anything I wish Anet would grow a spine and let the spergs sperg.
---
You realise this guy's just a troll, right? Look at his comment history. He's not the guy you want to be emulating.
---
They would just nerf everything into the ground until a potato can get through it. The reason why Living World only focuses on their shitty cringe-fest story is because that's the only part of the content casuals are actually able to get through without putting in effort.
---
Or the "Just go play another game" talk that then surprises them when people actually quit.
---
Where were you when LFG was an external website and fractals involved queuing in LA for half an hour for scale 20+
---
You can definitely expect a brand new super rare infusion for 10k gold on the tp!
---
Fuck you in particular.
---
Click on this hexagon icon there
---
At least put some effort into your announcement page to draw people in, come on Anet
---
That's a hilariously snarky response when you go on about what a barrier of entry the MSQ is.
---
"*Boy, this is a huge barrier of entry, but look at all this endgame fun I'm having!*"
---
Take it or leave it, giving someone the heads up about the MSQ isn't just said to apparently piss people like you off, it's a completely valid point to make, the game is built *around* it, if you don't like it, you better be prepared to have it shoved in your face, if you like the other content enough to deal with it, guess it's not that much of a dealbreaker. 
---
Shit, you only need to look at the comments *in this thread* of people saying they wanted to play the game, but the MSQ turned them off.
---
Keep getting pissy over silly shit though I guess. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Eso has a different business model than gw2. Unless you subscribe the dlcs are not free, so it’s usually better to subscribe . From map chats and guild chats, I’ve seen many players say they would not pay for a sub. I’d personally be fine with an optional sub if it meant reliable content drops like eso and ff14.
---
The way you phrase it constructive criticism equals positive comments. That's very asinine of you.
---
They came straight out and said that there wasnt an expansion well before that though.
---
D912pxy
---
The page when it releases will have the info describing what the festival is, as it always does.
---
As for the story, it's not something they've ever done.  They didn't advertise last year's Hallowe'en with the Joko info, because at the time not everyone had finished Episode 3 and seen that Joko was dead.  Only players who'd actually completed that episode could do the extra Joko-related content.  F2P was left out.  This will be the same.  On beyond ambient dialogue that may or may not be present, I'm sure only people who've completed Episode 6 will get to do whatever story nuggets might be dropped.  Advertising it for everyone will fall flat once the F2P players or the people who don't plow through every episode instantly (and those people do exist) find that they're locked out of it.
---
Can they do more to generate interest?  Sure.  Is hyping up a few screens of non-voiced dialogue with Zephyrite NPCs for players who've completed Episode 6 the way to do it?  I don't really think so, no.
---
Looking at mobile, it seems like casual players spend way more money than veterans.
---
I'm thinking if you have time to play 8 hours a day then you probably don't have a lot of disposable income.
---
Mostly because veterans have nothing to do in the game, and this is the forum to express those feelings.
---
Personally I dont know what is the stopping factor within Anet. We met MikeZ in person late 2018 and we actually had interesting talks with him about QoL features and community implementations. For example /u/2girls1up (sorry for the ping but you may remember a thing or two) talked about Discord Rich Presence support and Mike was like "man those are neat ideas, explain some more". It didnt seem like he wasnt disinterested or anything..
---
However the same day he told us there were no other projects running other than GW2, so take that prior paragraph with a pile of salt
---
People will buy anything, but not all people will buy everything. They obviously want to maximize their profits, and if their numbers show that lots of people are buying chairs, why wouldn't they milk that until the numbers show less people are buying chairs?
---
And with only those players left the game dies.
---
As someone who has played PvP since the beta and was top 250 EU I can say that it is if you enjoy the competition against others. Though you might experience some form of toxicity you've never met before as you rank up. It has gotten better in terms of rewards, so it's a nice way to get gold as well.
---
I'd like to see the study for that as well. Those are just random numbers on a small image.
---
I like to oneshot players from their Mounts, Healbrand, Healscrapper etc.
---
You get stunned for 1sec after you loose your Mount and your face hits the ground. Thats plenty to crit your ass to death right there.
---
Really like Thief P/P 3 and Slb Longbow *pewpewpew* to just nuke them from orbit, then have your buddys kill them with the Warclaw instahdeath dismount for a perfect fast kill.
---
No reaction time, no stupid rezzes!
---
Just crit them for up to 50k+ with your shots!
---
*pewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpewpew...*
---
Of course it is enough. If stating in game that things are annual doesn't confirm the event returning next year, you are beyond my ability of fixing.
---
&gt;But will LS5 be worth it? It better darn be.
---
Problem is, the hype surrounding it probably will mean it doesn't live up to peoples expectations. I'm personally expecting it to be a flop, regardless of how good it *actually* is.
---
Similar reasoning to why games like Half Life 3 will never release.
---
As a so-called "hardcore player", I'm currently thinking of quitting reddit instead.
---
I feel like they don’t get the expansion thing I feel like they hate it but no one ever ever said expansions were a problem but they seem to think they are *gasp*
---
crown pavilion boss farm mostly
---
There will be a couple of new maps to explore.  The Labyrinthine Cliffs map is the Zephyrite trading outpost, where you can use Zephyrite crystals and mounts to explore, collect things, race and earn achievements.  It's generally a place to chill out and take things easy, not a hectic map by any stretch.  Very little combat, generally only in a few festival events.
---
The Crown Pavilion is the other map, in Divinity's Reach.  This one is combat oriented.  The Boss Blitz is the primary group event there, challenging players to split into six groups to challenge six bosses within a time limit.  Killing a boss gives his abilities to the other surviving bosses, so killing them at the same time is strongly encouraged.  Unfortunately, due to reward creep, last year's Boss Blitz rewards were kind of subpar even when done properly for the max rewards, so hopefully that gets overhauled a bit.
---
The other activity in the Crown Pavilion is the Queen's Gauntlet.  Cages suspended above the Pavilion serve as arenas where you can challenge a series of NPC bosses to solo combat for achievements and titles.  GW2 doesn't have a lot of situations designed as challenging solo encounters, so the Queen's Gauntlet is a good test for players to see how they fare.  With the original foes from 2013 somewhat weakened by power creep, last year's return of the festival added a new tier of opposition that put up a bigger fight.  Can you beat them all?
---
gw2 is on life support now, they are rather investing in their mobile game for a much better money milker (since pople dont mind predatory monetization on this platform as much) ...
---
Amazing chest ahead
---
The real issue is here that it's pretty obvious Anet has shit communication when someone is praising Blizzard in the same thread.
---
Blizzard's always been very hit or miss with communication, they aren't really a great standard. It's miles better than Anet, but lets not forget how brilliant Ion Hazzegotanagenda is at pulling bullshit Lawyer tactics during Q&amp;A's with some of the answers he just avoids giving.
---
mushroom hp is easy. try soloing nightthistle bloom hp.
---
YES
---
Yeah, how do they measure good communication?
---
Can't leak something that doesn't exist :\^)
---
Or better yet. We can just wait and see what season 5 is.
---
The main issue is that the constant bitching gets old and tired.
---
Hope? People are panicking, throwing fits, publicly quitting, making refugee posts on other mmo subs, and you suggest this's a "hope" situation?
---
Personally I feel that Anet indeed has nothing good to tell us, tries to milk the dying cashcow of GW2 as long as possible before moving on or something. Or at least this was their plan before the layoffs and now they don't know what to do. Any assumption is correct unless proved wrong by Anet, but hey, they're silent.
---
I honestly don't care who made the dumb-fuck decisions, I just want them unmade, whether that's via a change of heart from the person responsible or a drastic change in leadership.
---
&gt; Streamers/youtubers adds as a tool for marketing. While some of the viewers play because a single content creator plays it. They're a great segway from mildly interested into downloading the game,causing some viewers to stick about in the game with the content creators help, and some even stay without them.
---
I agree, but as you said, there are also people who stay even without them. So it won't be like "Streamer XY brought YZ amount of players and take them with him, when he leaves".
---
&gt; Its never a good thing to completely ignore a marketing tool or act as it will be good without it.
---
I agree. But from what I read about it, people totally exaggerate. They act like these streamer(s?) are holding the whole playerbase together and like the whole game would die, if they leave. I can ensure you, this is not the case. 
---
&gt; The playerbase will suffer for gw2 Streamers not wanting to play gw2 anymore, thats just facts.
---
I don't agree to this. Sure, people will leave, if those streamers leave, but like I said before, that's mostly those kind of people, who play a game because of this streamer and not because of the game.  And like I said before, imo it's maybe even better if those people leave a game. 
---
The playerbase won't sink noticable if those people leave. And I think it's questionable if the "streamers bring new players into the game" argument is as strong as you think. 
---
I mean these streamers play GW2 for a while it's not like they just started. This means their communities already know what they are playing and I think it's really unlikely that people watch them for a long time and suddenly want to play GW2 too. Sure there will be some people, but that's not much. 
---
And if the mildly interested people you talked about search for a GW2 streamer, they still will find one. Mighty Teapot or whoever is not the only GW2 streamer. 
---
Another point, I googled who MightyTeapot actually is and I recognized that I saw some videos from/with him, because of reddit links. 
---
In these videos he talked tons and tons of shit about the game and that's a while ago, not recently. Don't get me wrong, he can say and think whatever he wants and I don't really care about it. But if you talk about marketing and that those streamers are good for this game, *those* statements are *bad* marketing. 
---
If mildly interested people looking for a streamer, find people like him and the first thing they hear is him talking about how shitty LS is (lies, baseless accusations, standard "hate") and stuff, it's *not* good for the game, it's *not* good for marketing and tbh It's maybe not that bad if those players/streamers leave the game. IMO
---
While I see your point I also want to point out that we only got Festival of the Four Winds last year after it was absent for a long time. I don't see people complaining about actual recycled festivals like SAB, Halloween, Wintersday and Lunar New Year. The feedback on last year's Fot4W was amazingly positive, and people said "keep going into this direction". And they did. In less than one year the re-made 2 festivals from GW2's early years. I suppose time passes and some content becomes repetitive, but I don't see re-pushing focus on specific content as a bad thing. I'd rather have a WB/Meta Event rush than have nothing. Also I see a lot of people brewing over having no idea where LWS 5 will go, and that there and no indicators. Why is that bad as well? We just had an amazing ending that closed a story arc stretching way back from LWS 3. The exciting part of LWS 5 for me is: Anything can happen next. For the first time in a long time prior ANET has a clean slate and can freely choose where the story can go. You can't push perfection, and I am the patient type of person that is ready to wait for games like Star Citizen. GW2 is nothing compared to that, and that is why I am perfectly satisfied atm.
---
PvP is where the combat (cooldown-based) system of GW2 really shines. It’s fast paced and hectic and playing the game is more important then just winning duels. It does get stale sometimes since Ranked matches only have a single PvP system (point capture) and all builds are centered around that. But I held off giving it a try for years and I regretted it when I finally jumped in. Since the matches are short, you don’t have the soul-crushing feeling like in MOBA games like League of Legends where you can be in a losing match for an hour. Overall I highly recommend it. Grab a build from Metabattle of your favorite class, jumped into Unranked (need to be level 20 for Ranked) and have a blast!
---
I was expecting a patch note. Needless to say I feel bad.
---
&gt; Did you even read my whole comment?
---
&gt; Did you even read my first comment?
---
... Please just *read*...
---
Any good reward from this ^  ?
---
Lmao. I'm in the same boat. Whiny children, man...
---
This sub is pretty depressing right now. Meanwhile the mood ingame seems fine from what I have seen. And this happens with every gaming sub any time there is a period between content and that varies by game.
---
Please people, lets not start to lash out against the implementation of the very things we suggested in the first place.
---
(Also shoutout, u/Monstrum27, I got to spot the charr behind the comics at the first boss rush.)
---
Yes, your comment is idiotic.
---
You can acquire the ebook here:

---
Thx for the kind and comprehensive answer.
---
People have wanted Sylvari/Mordremoth mounts for a long time. 
---
Risen could be nice as well, we have had no true zombie mounts as of yet.
---
&gt;We are also approaching two years since PoF released, which is around the time most MMOs get another expansion but GW2 has only announced S5, which likely means no expansion for another year (which is an eternity in MMO content cycles, two years is the norm for waits between expansions). Unfortunately ArenaNet has done this a lot (mismanage their resources and content releases so there are large droughts between either episodes or expansions).
---
I fear they might not even be making an expansion after S5. [I think S5 will be the last season.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cgvs4v/living_world_season_4_wasnt_the_last_season_but/)
---
Surveys and feedback from customers and using KPI’s mostly
---
Mobile games work of micro-transactions the same way GW does. This could quickly go into a discussion as to why the gem store is a mess and needs reworking but that’s for another time. 
---
Just to be clear. I said 8 hours. Not 8 hours per day. Not sure if you were referencing me or not. 
---
Additionally, being a veteran doesn’t mean you play 8 hours a day. I doubt that’s the case for most. As a veteran I’m sure I’ve sunk well over 400 dollars in this game. But none of that has been I he last 2 years (since the launch of PoF that is.)
---
Indeed, I'm totally expecting template slot expansions for sale, wonder what we'll get as standard release though, 2 per toon so it's basically functional for free, one slot per toon to push slot sales harder, or will they be more account or class bound like arcDPS does them?
---
Funny (or sad?) thing is that people demanded to get it back as an annual festival since it was released.
---
*Annual* Festival... google it.
---
Can't also forget that people in different countries have different purchasing power.
---
When you do digital pricing like Steam, releasing at max price, decreasing prices over time, then ending up with massive sales, you get cash from everyone, at the amount they can pay. Thos who pay pay in day one do it right away, and when barely anyone who would pay at the current price buys anymore, you lower the price a bracket. And then customer on that bracket buy.
---
If your prices stay the same over the years and only have small discounts ocassionally, then you get cash flux from whales on gemstore releases, a bit of a regular income from the rest, and rarely from anyone else. 
---
Removing items to create artificial scarcity may work in eastern markets, but in western markets methods like Steam pricing and indie bundles is what keeps people across the entire world buying, not just from high income ones.
---
It hasn't even been 3 months since War Eternal and it's in the middle of summer holidays. Was anyone actually expecting LS5 before August? Unsure what the complaining is - they'll be about a week - 10 days behind schedule if they release LS5 on August 20th. That's pretty OK considering summer guts most offices.
---
People on Reddit wouldn't shut up about not being able to sit in chairs.
---
Seriously, this sub has just been constant whining since the game's release.
---
I really liked the last one, so this is gonna be a perfect vacation
---
I did. I don't see how it makes this comment any better.
---
Let's be real. The reason anet communication is especially bad at the moment, is because they laid off Gaile Gray
---
You're aware FFXIV is Japanese and has been growing bigger for years now, and in fact recently had it's population double yes?
---
they still have at least 1 other side project in works
---
I don't think anet wants my opinion. If they did, they would be here. I'm simply not giving them any money.
---
Electron is just chrome, but it's loading a page from your computer instead of the internet.  &gt;P
---
Real talk, I'm really glad that it doesn't force me to grind ilvl and story and things like that, but I'd love if it gave me a reason to continue playing it lmao
---
People wanted festivals to fill the huge void between festival releases, *using festivals that were already in the game*. After Canthan New Year there were no festivals until Halloween, despite having SAB, Dragon Bash, and Bazaar in the repertoire. Now they've added them back, which is great. But they've always meant to be a background feature to celebrate and not a replacement for content. Right now they're functioning as filler which is understandable given the layoffs, but going into the future they should always be things that happen cyclically in the background and not a form of "here are the festivals so no new content until they're over."
---
Yeah... this picture is kinda... odd.
---
Not sure exactly why ANet used it for the Festival of the Four Winds announcement ( https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/festival-of-the-four-winds-returns-july-30/ ).
---
Unless they really did intend it to be an "on the table" reference? xD
---
&gt; They'd need the voice actor, pay him, and possibly add new animations. Is that worth it? Maybe not. I would assume not since they aren't doing it.
---
Yea its hard to say how "worth" stuff like that is. I dont claim to know the ins and outs of game development or have knowledge or costs associated with it. What I do know is mad king says comes around its something friends and guildies consistently bring up is how great it would be if the madking had new jokes, and how quickly it gets stale over the course of the festival. This is especially evident on rounds where the mad king repeats the same joke 3+ times. Im not saying that should never happen but it highlights how few jokes the mad king has. Imo festivals that are carbon copies of the previous year get old faster and faster each year, and that is not good for anyone. Little changes could go along way to getting the playerbase excited (if only a tiny bit) for festivals instead of being more blase about the whole thing. 
---
Someone replied to me a few days ago and I liked the way they phrased it, "Its like anet is fishing in a ocean with only 2feet of line" what ever the reason for only using 2feet of line it would be awesome if they could do more.
---
Don't have time to read it right now, but is that for business *in general*, or for gaming companies in particular. Because gamers are very different consumers than what you would consider in business 101.
---
Par the course:
---
* Last Wintersday: [https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/wintersday-arrives-next-week/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/wintersday-arrives-next-week/)
---
* Last Halloween: [https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/halloween-is-coming-soon/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/halloween-is-coming-soon/)
---
The two biggest festivals got 1 paragraph, and 1 non-descript image for the "it comes next week!" announcement. Usually the showcasing of new rewards or activities occurs in non-ArenaNet news posts.
---
Though the Halloween one did feature the return of Reaper's Rumble, it made no mention or image of the new infusions or weapons. All that came from third party sources. Same with Dragon Bash.
---
Right, because the current state of the game is what? Healthy? Sustainable? 
---
If you're looking at the game right now and you're satisfied and content, you have low standards. If you're looking at it's future with optimism, you either have low standards or are naive.
---
People want engaging content to repeat, not mindlessly pressing 1 and F for festival dailies.
---
What scares me to think is maybe they don't actually have a clear roadmap to offer (at least not one that people would get excited about).
---
Sounds like an awesome idea. Maybe we can acquire them in game via some sort of activity or collection quest?
---
Nah, who am I kidding. Straight to the gem store you go!
---
I want to give them my money but they never deliver a product worth paying for.
---
&lt;3
---
ANet stopped communicating with us after reddit went bonkers with the JP situation a year ago (not saying it wasn't justified but it was kinda insane). After layoffs, they only became more uncertain of themselves. They aren't afraid of not sticking to schedule, they are afraid of the image this community forms. Funnily enough, not communicating also leads to the reddit sewage eruption.
---
It's amazing how we went through 9 months between season 2 and HoT with literally only content being 2 weeks of Lunar New Year in february while now reddit loses their minds after two months with a raid wing, festival and three small events inbetween...
---
Thanks for being reasonable.
---
The latest balance patch let me lose faith in anet. Yes, I actually had faith in them, even after playing for 7 years and having seen everything, call me naive. That patch seemed like they laid off the remaining few people with competence. So regarding the future of the game and anet's ability to learn from mistakes...it's looking rather grim. And I love this game, honestly. Please anet, make some changes for the better.
---
To be honest I don't see how "hardcore" players correlate positively with gem store purchases. The skins locked behind a skill-wall are severely lacking in both quantity and quality compared to skins locked behind a pay-wall (e.g. raid chairs, raid weapon skins, fractal weapons, WvW/PvP/Raid legendary armor dye channel support, etc). There's simply no motivation for casual whales to spend any time in Raid or Fractals if Fashion Wars is all they are after. The only exception I can think of is Vision, and even that is a time gate instead of skill gate. The game rewards you even if you fail raid encounters...   
---
Now I'm not saying that there are no whales that are also hardcore players. I'm just saying that there's nothing about being hardcore players that also encourage you to be whales. Hardcore gamers probably are not over represented in the gemstore revenue. There are tons of casual whales that have never stop foot in fractals over T1, or Raids. I know quite a few myself.   
---
**By all means, quite GW2 if you aren't having fun, but I doubt the loss of veteran players weigh too heavily on ANet's mind compared to new players.** If anything, new players are more likely to buy items from the gemstore that you only ever need 1 of (e.g. infinite harvesting tools, salvage-o-matics, bank tabs, character slots, etc).
---
Anet adding chairs as content is the biggest meme.
---
&gt; It sounds like it's going to be literally the same as last year
---
But... that's the point of annual festivals, not? 
---
Also they never talked about new rewards/skins or something in their announcements. Most likely there will be new stuff, but we have to wait until the actual start.
---
We run healbrand and alacren too, running power quickbrand is the definition of not worth it to me (also pugs don't like no heals).
---
I still run recs if they are long, it's not like theres anything else to do in game tbh!
---
"What? This is my Wyld Hunt? NOOOOOOOOooooooooooooo"
---
Did you read the post?
---
I actually just started WoW again a month ago from WOTLK and absolutely loved it....for a month. After a month I did most of everything. All that’s left is just running my weekly raids mythical and conquest caps which is fun, but it feels hollow and I don’t know why.
---
Makes me a bit sad because I honestly enjoy WoWs classes and abilities more
---
Talk about scraping the bottom of the barrel.
---
Because pressing 1 on a new map is better right? 
---
Brainafk farming is always the same, no matter if there is new content or not. 
---
PS. Pressing 1 won't get you anything at the Festival of the Four Winds. ;)
---
Those were canceled (or at least put on indefinite hold) when they had to lay off a good half of their staff. Last we were updated ANet was 100% focused on GW2, and if that's changed in the last six months is hasn't been communicated to us (not to mention it wouldn't make much sense, and would probably draw the ire of NCSoft)
---
Well, because I agree with them celebrating pale mother's day.
---
Lol, braindead people
---
I hate it that gw2 doesn't use the same paid model as ffxiv or wow, I'd love to pay each month for loads of extra content.. now I'm 5.6k hours in the game since launch (main pve player) and the lack of good content that doesn't get boring after 1 month is disturbing..
---
Used to be end-game pvper ; anet fucket the esports
---
WvW is fun; but the fact that my 3k rig will still have fps loss in a zvz because of bad coding makes my heart cry.
---
Now I'm playing ffxiv and I'm enjoying it a lot because of the tons of content it brings with it but I cry in my heart of what gw2 could've been..
---
firebrand/renegade is meta for the cm fractals and like 75-90% of the regular t4
---
They don't communicate, they get criticized.
---
They communicate but don't keep the timeline, they get criticized.
---
They communicate and keep the timeline, they get criticized.
---
So what's the difference, they get criticized anyway.
---
This is just a game, why so serious.
---
&gt; Neither of which a new player will have.
---
Gemstore.
---
Be wary of mimicry
---
Complaining there's two festivals in a row is different than complaining about "recycled content". I have no issue with "recycled content" here at all - but with the community events literally giving us no time without new or limited time things to do since April 29th risks the issue of burning folks out just as Season 1 did. And *that* is an issue.
---
&gt;People wanted festivals to fill in the content droughts. This is doing exactly that. We literally asked for this.
---
While true, people also said they shouldn't occur more frequently than every other month at most. Four Winds, imo, should have been better pushed back 2-3 weeks. We have the ideal amount of festivals now, for those who did want more festivals, but these two are bit too close together.
---
nah, dark souls is difficult
---
Then focus on that idea instead bringing up the other one!
---
pretty sure they dont. because of those layoffs.
---
Playing 2 whole builds isn't fun, and you always lose if you spend cds on dismounting them if they are actual good players.
---
It just isn't fun at all anymore, i enjoy tanky bruisers mainly too. I already played soulbeast longbow since mounts and look what they did to that, nerfed because they balance around windowlickers and now it's impossible to win against holo or mesmer, or a good thief.
---
Wow, your parents must be very proud of you ignorance and arrogance. Education done right!
---
The alternative is that we have nothing but new gemstore releases until LWS5. ANet has already stated their plans regarding LWS5 and they haven't deviated much from their ambiguous schedule.   
---
**If people want to get mad at ANet at something, it should be at ANet's absolute radio silence of upcoming updates.** Not at their attempt to break up content drought by recycling old festivals (that they are still modifying, believe it or not). There are still new players coming into GW2 that have never experienced these festivals before, and they will probably enjoy these.
---
LS1 was even weaker.  People just remember the 3 highpoints and forget the 18 low to mediocre points.
---
You brought up the other one first, tho.
---
Is this the best troll you can do?
---
This is disappointing. I was really hoping they'd push Festival of the Four Winds back by three weeks given the addition of Dragon Bash.
---
This will burn folks out, especially with the constant community events.
---
That said, I hope they made updates to the Queen's Gauntlet. Last year was fun, but damn was it unrewarding. Especially if you had done the original content before.
---
Do you have anything aside from speculation to base that on? Because financially the Living World system has served ANet quite well, and in design terms it's basically the same release model as any other large MMO with a fancy name and a greater focus on open world content. They need to have something to fill the gap between expansions, and having it be almost exclusively Raids and Dungeons doesn't fit with the core design of GW2 - trying to do what other MMOs do, poorly, would kill the game faster than anything.
---
Thinking about it you may be right. I think the wording was something like transtioning straight into lw5.
---
The only thing that made me think it may take longer is that the last episode seemed a bit like it was wrapping the whole thing up. I can't remember what came first the layoff or the lw5 announcement.
---
If the layoffs came after the lw5 announcement, then I would expect it to be on the 3-4 month schedule.
---
If lw5 was announced after the layoffs then I think there is a chance we could have a lot longer delay. I was just thinking that there would be a chance that the only started working on lw5 after the other projects was cancelled, and an episode takes 9 months to make.
---
I love this festival, it's my favorite?
---
Another "ThE gAmE iS dYiNg" post? 
---
You are boring...
---
&gt; You can communicate plans and if you can't execute them, you can communicate why it happened
---
Halted Gen 2 Legendaries releases after HoT would like a word about this. People were screaming boycotts and asking for a refund.
---
Dude you are sooo delusional. There is no good content getting added to GW2. Omg we are getting 2h of easiest content, a story, every 4 months... Seriously???!?!?!
---
I didn't realize I wasn't allowed to talk about the fesability of moving events from one city to another.
---
Welp, I hope everyone is happy now xD ya'll deserve this!
---
You clearly weren’t here during LS1 and LS2. It wasn’t “it took two season.” LS 1 was a mess and the population plummeted, because Anet said that was how they were going to do thing going forward. They were keen on the idea the game could thrive on bimonthly updates and no expansion. 
---
After that shit show they said they were making another LS that would lead into the first xpac (LS2). HoT came out as an unfinished mess because population hemorrhaging was so bad they rushed the xpac. Then there was a long content drought as they “fixed” (but really completed) HoT. This is actually the reason the second legendaries just finished 5 years later. 
---
If you want to use the past as an example, actually know what happened.
---
They just discovered catgirls. That sylvari doesn't fancy herself as a scratching post.
---
Streamer leaves GW2 -&gt; fans follow him -&gt; fans say game is dead now.
---
I'm in the same camp as you, and I still think they can turn this around - keep in mind that it will take six or more months for the effects of any changes to actually impact the game. The long delay between S4 and S5 isn't a good sign, but I will be far more concerned if they don't pick up the pace for episodes 2 and 3.
---
The time for "suggesting improvements" is past. It was past before HoT was even announced. 
---
The reason I say things are shit is because they are shit, and dumb, and fucking horrible. Why should I sugarcoat things for your sensitive ears?
---
We can't let something as trivial as logic and rationality interfere with a good whinge.
---
Oh goodie, here I thought I was just being a derp again.
---
Wonderful, just another nail on the coffin of enjoyment when playing chronomancer.
---
Why people don't remember more than a year past is beyond me.
---
Talking about gemstore stuff like chars as content is the biggest meme...
---
Lol my inbox confirms that.
---
They had a skeleton crew working (albeit with great dedication) on the game throughout the last season because they were putting all their workforce into other projects, which were then shelved. (So this game suffered for nothing.) 
---
Now is the moment where it truly sinks in that there will be no new expansion anytime soon while other MMOs are getting major content patches, and people are getting all worked up to a frenzy. But it's evident to me that S5 will be done differently from S4, with more workforce behind it and more content out of it, and I think the radio silence only hammers that home. One year ago, they had several things in the works. Now, they have just one game. (And maybe one other project at most.) 
---
They can not give us an expansion now, they have not had any people preparing one throughout the entirety of S4, probably exactly because they planned two seasons.
---
So S5 is all we are getting. There is no point in saying that the game will die just because it is another living world season. 
---
The only necessity is that this season must retain players better than last season did. Maps must be more replayable, rewards more attractive, and raids and fractals must have a lot more substance. 
---
They can't just cancel the living world model now. Doing that will set them back another couple of months. All we can do now is wait for the episode and hope that it reflects a positive trend for the coming season.
---
You’re playing the wrong genre. You may prefer single player RPG’s like Skyrim.
---
the whales hold all the power on all cash shop based non subscription MMOs
---
That explains why sometimes 1 or 2 skills of my CS rotation were on cooldown yesterday.
---
Hopefully it will get fixed soon.
---
Look around, many people do. 
---
Aso you said, they are cool.
---
It's not. Judging from the last message from the game director in April...
---
Well it's been like that since ... forever since the same is true for the corrupted weapon set.
---
Are you new here?
---
Same thing happened to me. It _is_ intentional that you cannot craft something that is soulbound to another character; it is _not_ intentional though that you can't use Guild Weapons for crafting.
---
You should contact support and explain the situation, they sent me a replacement item so I could use it with the correct character.
---
Wow you are so far off. It’s not about the episode. It’s about encouraging get store transactions. If someone leaves, they are 0% likely to make a transaction to a game they don’t play. 
---
Man you did miss the point by a mile. Maybe read all of it before you post?
---
I don't watch any GW2 streamer. How does that explain my post?
---
That would certainly be neat, although I doubt it would be neat enough to make up for the wait. ANet has to do a difficult balancing act with player expectations right now, and delaying for a nice date (as opposed to, day, a major feature) might not be worth it.
---
My endgame is shitposting on Discord with guildmates. 66 people active in Discord. I think about 5 still have GW2 installed.
---
They should definitely be giving us news on new upcoming content and the direction the game is going post NCSoft shake up. 
---
Personally I'd like 1 festival every other month and on the off months, add in some new content. The previous 2 week cycle was too much, but the current 4 months seems too much. Once they get into this pattern the festival should be near maintenance mode.
---
At this point I'm hoping it'll be the end of it :/ the amount of shit it's getting from both the devs and the community is astounding..
---
an abusive ex that keeps promising that they'll change.
---
&gt; Then the mass firings happened ..
---
Yeah but the mass firings happened b/c the new games in development were so bad they had to be scrapped completely...
---
Oh my ears are not sensitive, I just don't like your condescending tone.
---
&gt; when Anet has shit communication
---
And then you wonder why Anet don't feel inclined to communicate with their playerbase
---
Gee, can't think of a reason why!
---
I need to put down the weed.
---
I said they're cool but useless.
---
I probably see nobody on them because I'm doing content and not sitting in a chair somewhere.
---
Wow... there are *still* people who don't understand the layoff thing? 
---
The layoffs affected only people who worked on a *non-GW2* project. Mean they still have the same manpower for GW2 as they had before. Also they started hiring recently.
---
there's so much entitled bitching about literally everything
---
I enjoy WoW's world and volume of content, and it's art style. But I wish it had GW2's depth of costmetics (every robe wasn't just a different skin), GW2's cosmetic unlock system, GW2's mobility, and GW2's ability to keep old content relevant.
---
as a general rule the problems with expansions like warlords of draenor and battle for azeroth haven't been that there themselves bad, it's the lack of content. most people believe the draenor was actually pretty good - there was just fuck all to do. I found plenty to do and quite enjoyed exploring the world, but I also didn't force myself to play after I stopped having fun. I would have enjoyed warlords of draenor much less had I done that. But I didn't, and so it's one of my favorite expansions.
---
Same is true for 24/28 slot bags... because “reasons”.
---
Human beings ability to vastly overestimate their level of expertise, on seemingly almost any topic, never ceases to amaze me.
---
I wasn't there for S1 but I was there S2 HoT and so forth. HoT wasn't announced until the end of S2 as teaser for it and HoT was an unbalanced mess that has since been course corrected. And I don't  count Wings 1-3 as a "content drought" just a bunch of weenies that were too scared to raid.  Season 3 started after that as well as fractal reworks and S3 Lead to PoF which in turn lead to S4 and now S5.
---
Honestly that explains everything.
---
Can we ask mods to create some kind of "Weekly Drama" or "Vent thread"? And just shove it all there? 
---
My friends just started playing. They have literally nothing yet, everything have to be discovered. But they read reddit. They told me that everyone says game is dead so they almost quit right now
---
GW2 is done as far as big new content goes. It's a 7 year old game, it's in maintenance mode. They were 100% focused on developing other games, the problem was that they were such utter junk they had to be scrapped. Now Anet is scrambling to figure out what to do next.
---
&gt;If you want to use the past as an example, actually know what happened.
---
It's like people have fucking amnesia on this sub I swear.
---
Thanks xen!
---
That's not the point.
---
The longer Anet takes, the bigger the hype is that players have to cling to in order justify staying with the game instead of just leaving to play something else.
---
(And they can't all just leave and come back later because leaving causes a chain reaction with other people just leaving because their friends/guildies aren't playing)
---
&gt;Can we at least wait for the FFXIV expac to lose some of it's freshness and hype before jumping to sweeping conclusions?
---
I don't even play FFXIV so I have no idea why this would apply to this post.
---
Useless, but still cool. 
---
Look at LA, the other cities or when people waiting for world bosses. There are always people with chairs and stuff.
---
People are bored/worried because theres no teaser for future content like in the past, and silence in communication. I do not think the majority goes playing other mmo's. Most players who play guilwars 2, do it for the solo/casual friendlyness, and migrated to singleplayer games, or a break for gaming until exciting new news emmerges. The summer is also a reason, people go outside and go on vacation/trips/swim etc. Yes theres a world outside to explore;-)
---
I already quit months ago.  
---
Where's my cookie?
---
&gt; What are expansions in games like WoW, Final Fantasy or even GW1? Massive content drops that expand every area of the game. 
---
WoW expansions are the exact opposite, though. The game gets smaller every expansion (until it's patched back up to par), because only the current content is worth doing. All the other content gets nerfed into oblivion and, aside from transmogs and mounts from solo-able content, the old stuff is almost never worth doing again. 
---
It's something that on paper doesn't seem like it should work, but apparently people prefer it to games like ESO and GW2 where content never becomes outdated.
---
"tongue but hole".
---
not to disagree with your point, but ANet only does patchnotes type updates every other Tuesday, and last Tuesday was the balance patch? so I've no clue why people are frothing over no update today; today is the gemstore update day, has been for years, so IDGI
---
Good communication really does go a long way. Look at Digital Extremes and Warframe. Their major content releases have been pushed back for literal years, and the community still loves them to death because of the constant communication and transparency.
---
It makes sense considering you yourself are not a shatter anymore.
---
You say the sub is being hypocritical like they are all one hive mind. Some people begged for festivals, others complain that it is recycled content. You simply have different people with different views on it, and nothing is hypocritical about that.
---
You can make points via festival achievements easily. So not doing them is a loss. This I mean with "forced".
---
TBH the idea of character bound items is idiotic and should go back to it's wow origin.
---
No use for it in gw2 why is it still a concept. 
---
Account bound makes sense but character bound.. what is this the dark ages
---
If it wasn't mindnumbing open world pve i would play it longer...
---
&gt; fractals must have a lot more substance
---
after the last set of changes I am not expecting anything great out of that team ...
---
This is the same old BS from the community, basically.
---
New episode releases -- everyone is happy and raving about how much they love it for a while.
---
A month or two passes without a new episode, and people inevitably start complaining about "content drought", which quickly morphs into complaining about literally anything and everything that isn't exactly what they want at the exact moment they demand it. They start complaining about ANet being silent -- which was a valid complaint in the past, but ANet has been keeping us updated pretty regularly ever since the layoffs, and it wasn't *that* long ago since we got some communication, but suddenly people act as if it's been 6 months or more even when it hasn't really been that long since we heard from them.
---
I agree that this is a lot of "events" in a row, which can certainly burn people out, but if LW5 isn't ready yet and people are starting to complain about how slow and awful the game is and how many people are jumping ship, what do you expect them to do? They're trying to give us stuff to keep us engaged. Sure, getting the new season would be better, but they can't just pull it out of their asses if it isn't ready to go yet. 
---
(And seriously guys, we were very recently welcoming a *ton* of new players into the game -- like literally less than a month ago -- and now we're already spiralling into the "woe, the end of the game is nigh!" drama shit again. This community is wonderful most of the time, but we're also depressingly predictable when it comes to our cycles of content and discontent.)
---
Or you need more. Like us, who were there
---
I appreciate that they try to fill the gaps but they said the next season starts right after the last one end and I expected them to not wait half a year for something new to happen. I'm not mad or anything just a little bit disappointed that there probably won't be a reason to. Log in within the next 3 months or so
---
But I mean, they do give us a reason to come back.
---
Every 2 weeks they artificially lock and unlock skins, outfits, items, etc.
---
Just so you can't buy them now but come back later and buy them. In the meantime, maybe spend some gems on other things. So they can get more gems. 
---
TBH I wonder if it actually works. I don't buy items unless I want them. Waiting 6 months is ridiculous though IMO. Take my money now. Geez
---
Can't talk for others. Personally I feel angry at Anet and at GW2, and announcing yet another festival when so many people are worried about the future of the game and just want to be reassured, is what hurt me most.
---
Whining in the hope of getting some reaction from Anet is the last thing I can do before leaving for good.
---
Excuse me? Hardcore Casuals?
---
I just thought it would be a cool in-game feature but I understand that it would be complicated.
---
I was gonna say the same thing.  OP is assuming people are in both groups and while some might be, its not entirely true.  Sure the hive-mind is kind of annoying but that's how reddit has always been.  There are highly upvoted posts on here the past week that would have been downvoted into oblivion in the past.
---
Why can't they just communicate their plans without a rigid schedule?  Look at Warframe, they show off stuff in development and most of it they just say "coming soon".  Communication =/= timeline roadmap.  All we want is some info on what's going on, what's coming, what's being worked on.  
---
They could have dropped a 10 second teaser trailer for S5 a week after the LS4 finale or the Raid release ([because ya know they said S4 would go straight into S5](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/660876#Comment_660876)).  Then a few weeks later drop a dev diary, "S5 episode 1 is coming right along, we're also working on &lt;insert qol features, etc.&gt; that will come a little later down the road, and long term we are working on an expansion at the conclusion of S5.  Then every few weeks drop a screenshot or gif of something unreleased that is being worked on.  Bam, that is literally all they have to do to please a lot of vets (me included)
---
There's 2 groups of people. The people that love the combat system and the people that love item acquisition/activity loop, obviously with tons of overlap. The people you see complaining/leaving are the combat group while the overlap group and the activities group are pleased as punch with the game. The problem is this game has relatively unique combat for an MMO so all the people in the combat group want this to be a game that it just isn't anymore
---
Whiners whinna whine.
---
Does anyone know how long these chests will last if not claimed? I won't be able to login until I get off of work later tonight and was just wondering. Thanks.
---
&gt; Yeah sure but its better to have fights and try to oneshot them than having no fights at all. Tanky Bruisers are dead, you need to be engaged and can't pick fights on your own - you get picked!
---
That sounds very boring, and it is, i tried it.
---
&gt;Its not like you won't find fights at all, there are plenty but like half the people you find in WvW will just skip you and run ahead. There is no chance to fight them unlike before mounts, you need to bring damage to fight them.
---
More like 80/90% of poeple skip out on fights with equal numbers.

&gt;If you're angsty fighting dismounted players... never engage Warriors and other Rangers, their passives keep them above 50% HP and there is no way to oneshot them. Otherways just bring a Buddy and 2v1 his ass, if you proceed to oneshot your opponent your buddy can stomp him with dismount and your enemys friends can't help at all because thats just too fast to deal with.
---
What is fun about 2v1? Also, why would they run an actual good noncheese build?
---
Compared to pre-mount the situation is just 10 times less fun, not exaggerating at all.
---
I don't know what to do, i miss the game i loved so much.
---
I meant to ask too, how is the WvW pvp? Sounds like my kind if thing too.
---
I mean I'm not agreeing or disagreeing   with the design, I'm just saying they very intentionally made the shatter effects based on the clones and not yourself. Csplit is no exception.
---
Meanwhile year ago, it was just dreams to have it back...
---
This seems normal in most online gaming communities now. Typically you have to actually chat in-game if you want to be positive/speak to the people that still enjoy the game. I guess the subreddit gets some traffic from people that used to enjoy playing, while the game itself gets zero traffic from people that used to enjoy playing, hence the difference in average opinion.

From the official patch notes on the anet forums  07/16/2019—July 16 Release Notes "Continuum Shift: This skill now replaces distortion in the F4 slot instead of taking the F5 slot. Additionally, it applies 1 second of distortion when cast. Duration has been rescaled based on the number of clones to 3/4.5/6 seconds. This skill now specifies that it cannot be reset by other mesmer skills."
---
It really stinks how they choose to exclude cooldown effects for shatter, could it be that which is happening? I'm to scared/salty to touch my Chrono since the changes dropped
---
I still hope that each release of season 5 will bring up some bigger stuff, maybe one elite spec every episode or something please you can't keep a game alive for two years with short stuff every few months
---
More racial mounts too. We have asura and norn mounts, but would enjoy charr, sylvari, and Krytan-styled mounts.
---
Your argument seems very anecdotal “ I don’t buy gems so others don’t too”. You can seem revenue loss as a function of time away from expansions in quarterly update. Intuitively, player retention is linked to revenue.  You can’t sell a product when people aren’t there to buy it. The whole thesis of my argument. 
---
I’m glad you take breaks and that’s healthy. However, having people disagree with the direction of the game or lack of content relevant to them and telling them to go away for a while hurts your own interest.
---
To be fair, annual festivals get stale in every MMO. If you're a veteran, you sweep in for the new shiny thing, maybe poke some nostalgia, then it's off to the usual raid/roaming/farming. I'm not sure why folks expect GW2 to be different in its festival content.
---
&gt;we have had no true zombie mounts as of yet.
---
The biggest disappointment of Awakened.
---
Second biggest is that the Awakened don't use Awakened mount skins.
---
Logic is as follows: the event will be starting July 30th, and Festivals usually last three weeks, so it should end on the 20th. ANet doesn't, in my experience at least, have content releases run straight into each other, and patch cycles are generally 2-3 weeks, meaning that the absolute earliest we can expect them to launch S5 is August 27th, with September 3rd being much more likely in my book. To be sure, having the next Living World season drop right before the game's anniversary would be awesome, but I personally wouldn't bet on it (and at this point I'd rather be wrong about a later date than an earlier one).
---
It depends on what you consider to be the complete package. If I buy a car, but buying the engine inside the car is a separate purchase, I'd say you're nickle and diming me. If I buy a car, and I have the option of getting rich leather seats instead of the standard, I wouldn't say that. The seats are a cosmetic purchase that isn't inherent in my purchase of the car, and isn't required to use the car.
---
FFXIV's cash shop is entirely cosmetic. I wouldn't consider anything in the store as part of "the package" which is the game. The game itself is a complete package, and you can also buy this frivolous stuff if you like. 
---
From what I've heard, GW2's cash store is all cosmetic as well, so I wouldn't call that nickle-and-diming either. It's all in addition to the package.
---
You do realize this is not new, this is how shatters worked before too. And distortion did actually instantly shatter all clones to give you distortion buff depending on the amount of clones.
---
It did not wait for clones to go to enemy, it didnt look if clones are CCed.
---
So design wise, CS is similar to distortion and this is how it is supposed to work, design wise. CS is the exception right now.
---
If you're interested in a game mode with a lot of depth, I recommend PvP. Despite the fact that it's generally overlooked by Anet, competition drives it to a level of complexity unparalleled by the other game modes. The challenge goes on and on. Anet did one thing very well in GW2: combat. High level PvP really showcases the polish in the combat system.
---
I recommend PvP with some hesitation, however. It can be toxic, frustrating and addicting.
---
I quit in november/december and came back for GvG draft turnament in february and quit again. I love combat system in GW2, but i'm not happy with the game. I complain because i love this game, but it's sooooo screwed up.
---
Unfortunately I completely agree with you, I began playing since head start and "quit" roughly 1 and a half years after HoT (with the intentions of coming back because I love the GW series and because I've put so much time into it).    
---
I returned with PoF and played for roughly 6 months before quitting again - I know I a lot of people say there's a huge amount of content in this game, but it does get stale very quickly.    
---
    
---
If they announce another expansion then I'll buy it and check it out, but until then I don't want to return to see a re-run festival. They were fun and exciting the first time around, but not as interesting another time.
---
What does this accomplish, does this make you feel better?   When people talk about "casual toxicity" it's shitty off-hand and dismissive remarks like this.  I'm just going to screenshot this, actually.
---
Phew. No longer have to hold on to all those mats!
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/december-11-2018/
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/october-16-2018/
---
Both got release pages on their release days. The preannouncements have been spare since the very beginning:
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/wintersday-is-here/
---
*cough* **WvW Alliances** *cough*
---
However, a good example, especially when our last "semi-detailed" update was back in November last year... I'd love more info. outside of "we're working on it" because, at this point, are you even sure yourselves? Call me impatient, but I agree: if I was kept updated on the process of what's going on, I'd be more inclined to talk positively about the mode.
---
I quit in november/december and only thing that carried me to that time was my guild and our competitive spirit to defeat Ash again.
---
So ***that's*** what was happening!
---
More difficult to understand since your PvE armor, weapons, food and stat buffs all carry over into WvW. 
---
In PvP your stats are based on amulet and tunes and are standardized. But in WvW, ascended armor and weapons plus food makes a large difference. 
---
Also you are split between roaming on the map or running with a Zerg blob. There are builds for each. And running away is easy since the map is enormous. 
---
Build diversity is higher though because you are not just fighting over a small point. And more people and potentially outnumbered too.
---
Sure it was, "we have nothing, lets make an excuse".
---
Thank you for this original and well thought out thought that if "Anet doesn't give me what I want it will be the end of the game." Truly this needed its own thread vs the several others a day we have to slog through.
---
Remember when they couldn’t make cadence and had to reorganize and everyone used that as an excuse to a problem “yeah reorganizing takes time to materialize results.” 
---
Now layoffs are the move. And then the next restructuring. Gotta have the next excuse ready.
---
In recent year or so I stopped really discussing GW2 or its future outside of my small circle of friends. Reddit used to be... well, something else. But now I honestly can't stand the daily whine about "no content" and "dead game". I get it, people are scared and want reassurance but all it does is creating a downward spiral. I used to have so much fun here but it really became a #NoFunAllowed place...
---
&gt; Hopefully it will get fixed soon.
---
Hopefully the whole line of changes gets reverted and forgotten like a nightmare dream.
---
god I thought it was just me. the negativity in this sub is out of control to the point I thought about unsubbing! my theory is that LWS4 ended on a fairly "final" note, and that combined with no clearly communicated future plan from the company has put people into panic mode. personally I'm still having a blast with the game and know that whatever content they do release in the future I'll happily eat up.
---
The whole raid wings were that “delay so it seems like we are being strategic”
---
this is not guild wars veterans, it happens to be where thoose feelings are expressed but it isint just for you.
---
Infinite poop. You sit on the toilet to poop, but the poop never stops coming out of your butt. You have to start flushing the toilet every two minutes to keep up. You try to pinch your butt closed but that makes your insides hurt. The poop accelerates. You call 911. The paramedics call for doctors. The doctors call for specialists. The story trends on Twitter. You turn down talk show appearances. Your septic tank fails. People form a cult. Your toilet is finished. Volunteers arrive with buckets and shovels. You are completely used to the smell. The poop accelerates. You are moved to a stepladder with a hole in the top step. The poop accelerates. The shovelers abandon the buckets and shovel directly out the window. The poop accelerates. A candlelight vigil forms around your house. One of the workers falls over and can't free himself. The poop accelerates. A priest knocks over the stepladder and tackles you out the window. You land in the pile. The poop accelerates. The force now propels you forward and upward. Vigil goers grab at your legs. The poop ignites from their candles. The Facebook live event hits 1 million viewers. The poop accelerates. You are 30 feet in the air. The fire engulfs the vigil and your house. 60 feet. The poop accelerates. The torrent underneath you is deafening. 5 million Facebook live viewers. You try to close up shop but your butthole disintegrated long ago. 120 feet up. Your house explodes. The poop accelerates. 1000 feet. You are now tracked on radar. You try to change your angle of ascent but you should have thought of that way earlier. The poop accelerates. 4,000 feet. NORAD upgrades to DEFCON 3. Concentric circles of fire engulf your city. The poop accelerates. You have broken the sound barrier. 30,000 feet. You no longer take in enough oxygen to sustain consciousness. 60,000 feet. CNN is reporting on all the world records you've broken. 200,000 feet. You are no longer alive. The poop accelerates. Your body disintegrates but your poop contrail remains. NASA can no longer track you. You break the light-speed barrier and we can no longer bear witness. The poop accelerates. Forever.
---
I almost submitted it last night, but it ties into things that I'm saving for a suggestion post.  I'll continue re-writing that post, but I don't want to submit like 2-3x posts a week because I think it con volutes the issues.
---
You’re welcome. None of that was mentioned but I’m happy you took nothing away from it.
---
&gt; The main issue is that the constant bitching gets old and tired. 
---
Seems like the bitching and the game have the same issues then. Just like you get tired of hearing it, vet players get tired of disappointment with each release.. Even the new maps only give a small bit to do in the overall scheme outside of farming it for gold when applicable. I consider myself a hardcore casual.. I don't do the whole tryhard shit, I play casually when I'm able.. but I've raided, I've done CM fractals, I've explored all the content in the game to a point of comfort, and I try to run optimally as often as possible, preferring my squad/party to do the same, but i'm fine if they don't so long as things are accomplished. The game feels stale.. Everything left to do is gated in some way, or has been repeated into oblivion by now. From a new player perspective, or from someone who only gets to play for a very limited amount of time each week, the game has TONS to do, but just because you find tons to do and enjoy, doesn't mean every person will have that same viewpoint.   
---
I'm sure you and many others are tired of hearing about one of your favorite games feeling drawn out and having nothing to do for a fraction of the playerbase, but OP is right, this is a problem overall, not just for them or myself. There are huge downsides to a losing players, especially if the game is more reliant on MTX than overall sales. The ones leaving aren't just the hardcore 'git gud' players, they are also the vets who try their best to make the community grand and golden, to help the newer players and bring them along through harder content that they may struggle with. They are the ones willing to carry bad dps just to give the player the experience of the game. There are a wide array of players leaving because the game is losing interest and the releases are on a long schedule that leads to droughts between them. If there were more current events, side stories, ect going on between episodes, then the game would feel more lively.. but annual festivals that are rinse/repeat content each year just does not cut it.. Dragon Bash was a great surprise, but now the festival schedule looks to be filled up, and next year there may not be much else added to Dragon Bash to keep it fun for those who did everything this year. The game was sold on the idea of live, dynamic events that make the world feel alive.. so lets keep that idea moving forward and bring in smaller things that keep player interest and keep the world feeling like its moving forward.
---
scrolling through the images has about the same framerate as playing i'm sure :P
---
If you think the game's going belly up in a year, you're just as delusional as the people who defend ANet's every move. You do realize that GW2 is ANet's only means of income? And that they have just been forced to work exclusively on this game? i.e. they have no backup and nothing in the event that GW2 dies? So explain the rationale where ANet would allow this to happen that makes more sense then the argument that we're going to get news of Season 5 after the FotFW in line with established release cadence?
---
Imagine being poor enough for 10€/month to be a measurable amount.
---
Not sure how these are remotely comparable. One was an intentional reorganization that we later discovered was to move game resources onto other projects, and one was an unintentional layoff of 30% of the company. Anet hadn't given us any official reason to believe that re-organization meant "trying to put out the same content with fewer resources", it was only deduced post-hoc.
---
That sounds like absolute cancer.
---
No, we are not playing in the same team. There is a team that will defend the game to it's dying breath and then there's a team that creates actual criticism so the game does not have a dying breath (at least for now, since nothing lasts forever)
---
Wow man you have a ton of gold :D
---
Wow look at  those lootboxes daed gaem 2/5.73
---
i love the idea of making it so that the crafting skill is account wide rather than per character. now i want that so bad
---
Just give up.
---
Have you seen the effort put into the blog post? Even less effort went into this festival probably.
---
bruh yours is even more.the regular person doesnt really buy the gemstore stuff, usually games with microtransactions are supported by whales. And furthermore the notion that a game you pay premium just to acess it (base game is now free but it wasant before,and you still need to buy expansions) plus has microtransactions needs more money sounds ridiculous.
---
bruh 💯😜🙌🙌😝🤤
---
Was thinking the same thing.  That diagram doesn't really compare apples to apples.  "Here's some good things that happened to good communicators, as compared to similar-sounding (but not the same) bad things that happened to bad communicators."
---
Back on topic, I'd love to get a few more dev insights. Maybe a follow up to their 'road map' from earlier this year.
---
The plebs are getting tired of the theme park and want new rides.  Its the major underlying problem with every single theme park MMO since the history of ever and yet for some reason people keep playing theme park MMO's and then they get mad when thats all that get made.
---
Preorder secured.
---
Nah just leftovers:-P
---
Have the theorycrafters already figured out the strongest raid dps build?
---
I played a ton of holo but that got nerfed
---
I have diviner aligade but that isnt really dps
---
I have a firebrand healer who can be quicknessbrand or a dragonhunter but switching gear traits is a pain because I mainly use the guardian as a fractal healer
---
I also have a support chrono/mirage and a a condi/power bannerslave and a Thief with berserker armor and maurauder trinkets  which I mainly use for WvW
---
Any advice which class can dish the most damage for a raid?
---
You can always come back to your dead guild!
---
Even tough I think that a I probably exaggerated a little I have to say that the event lasts some time and may 14th was also some time ago. If they decide to not release the next chapter within a few weeks after the event we probably have to wait until the end of summer. As I said I'm more or less fine with this although I hope/hoped that they go all in right after the ls ends.
---
Polished? This game is a buggy mess the devs can barely even update anymore.
---
People are getting saltier and saltier it seems.
---
Wait.. Super Adventure Box is coming back?
---
Those "insert OP's angry words here" chair skins and anything like it in the gem store is what generates income for Arenanet. In real simple terms, it helps to keep the game alive. So thank the buyers for actually lending a hand to prosper the game because it sounds like you're doing nothing but tossing a negativity tantrum that even my two year old can't possibly rival.
---
Only reason why people are “competitive” of who gets content, be it pvp, wvw, open world or raids/fractals is because Anet mostly focuses on one. People for some weird reason disliked the triple release even though it was arguably the best time for gw2 because (at least pve wise) everyone got content. 
---
Point is, If anet didn’t put full focus on one aspect of the game and tried to cater (as they advertised the game to begin with) to everyone then this “civil war” wouldn’t exist because everyone would be happy.
---
You don't need to be a game developer to know when this shit ain't right. Its called being a consumer and voicing an opinion.
---
Well it was/is primarily intended for content aggregation i.e. just links to other websites.
---
Living story has ruined this game since release, and the developers OBSESSION with making this a """""""story based"""""" MMO continues to ruin this game.
---
Explosives, Firearms, and Scrapper. Not that dissimilar to a cookie cutter Holosmith.
---
Thanks for the input.  I hope you find another game to enjoy.  Some of us will keep enjoying GW2 content.  Cheers.
---
If it was only about the condi cleanse then that is awful but the skill does have a pile of other things. If they provided reasons for why the condi cleanse(as opposed to the other stuff the skill does) is the straw the breaks the camel's back then that could be okay.
---
&gt; There is a team that will defend the game to it's dying breath 
---
The worst part is that if/when the game finally bites the dust, these people will all be pikawot.jpeg because they were all up on cloud 9 thinking that everything was fine.
---
Nope, jokes on them. The people who were being vocal were right all along.
---
I might seem pessimistic, but damn if the game hasn't made me this way already.
---
I mean, give this another day and you'll probably try to explain this on cats.  That's just it though... 
---
We're not playing on the same teams and the game doesn't encourage us in anyway to root for one another.
---
... It's problematic and it feels like parts of the game are legitimately on life-support.  Sure, they get some attention every once in a while, but it feels like that's more to assuage frustration than anything else... and then nothing... until it boils over. 
---
again, and again.  It hurts everyone, and it really doesn't feel like they want to support their own game.
---
Didnt they say after the mass layoff the schedule is different.  No long is it going to be updates in a particular order but the teams themselves are deciding what to work on?
---
If that's the case releases ever 2-3 months is a thing of the past.
---
You forgot world boss rush events! HYPE!!!!!!!
---
&gt; I'm glad we get festivals now instead of like pre-HoT where there was literally nothing but this doesn't excite me like I thought it would.
---
That's what we asked for ages, and ANet bit the bullet. "Players can point out the problems, but solutions they propose are usually worthless", as Sean Murray said in the interview about 2 months ago. I wouldn't say that this is exactly that case here, as quite a bit of people will have chance to enjoy the festival for the first time, and I'll definitely enjoy coming back to it, but I don't know if there is more people complaining about it's return now, than there were about it not returning earlier. Or asking for festivals during content "drought".
---
"So many people"
---
Well, I'm not sure about "many" but definitely loud.
---
They already have back in April, see here:
---
[https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/)
---
and than you realized,that you got 2 extra pips .... XD
---
Warrior, I'm using greathsword, 2 skills give some rush, but only 20 lvl and base movement is slow without mount after eso xD
---
Honestly this sub drives me nuts cuz it's nothing but constant incessant bitching about a game I've been enjoying since I started it a month or so ago.
---
it is vocal minority loud outcry. game is fine. there are now filled events like boss rush, dragon bash, not 4winds... people who complaining about the game are the ones who dont see anything but raids. if you take a look, they cry only about raids. they alays talk about how open world is easy and stupid content...
---
Aah I see. I have infinite harvesting tools, but they date from the “Molten” era so no VM for me. A VM harvesting tool does seem more interesting to me atm because I started going for the skyscale and it seems you can buy other maps’ resources with VM in dragonfall?
---
What gear for warrior is good now? Berserk or conditional damage?
---
FF14 has 2 weeks of content every expansion release and every 6 months.
---
It's not any better than GW2.
---
Gw2 runs really well on 4k res here. (Playing on a gtx 1080)
---
100+ fps with d912pxy with no players present and down to 30 fps in huge zergs.
---
The second that anytime challenge is put into the game the community losses its shit when they cannot beat something on launch day and keeps hammering away until its patched. So no, the game will not fail without challenge. Quite the opposite.
---
No spellbreaker would be caught dead with their pants doen in a gas station bathroom wearing harrier. Its more likely they were using a mix of Marauder weapons/armor and some kind of toughness trinkets like cavalier or knight, as the Spellbreaker doesnt have great healing power scaling on any of its skills. So Harrier with its Power, Healing Power, and Concentration bonuses wouldnt do anything for them, not to mention makes them squishy and lack damage.
---
Second set is probably something like sword/dagger, dagger/shield, or axe/shield.
---
Runes and traits sound about right. Shame about the utilities but since he has bounty the other sigil(s) probably are something that gives a boon on crit, which probably tells us that they have a build that likes uptime on the meager amounts of boons warrior can give itself, like stability, might, fury, resistance, swiftness, etc.
---
All in all its probably someone who made an already safe class that can walk through a 1vX situation into one with a fairly high boon duration.
---
I'd rather pay a sub fee then deal with bullshit like the gem store.
---
I also played WoW, and was a shaman main from vanilla to Ulduar (middle of the second expansion), and was playing elementalist from BC onward.  The class and spec I played was basically a pariah class due to issues such as terrible scaling in PVE. I witnessed the Tseric meltdown, where a community manager who was in charge of my class got tired of the player's constant toxic discontentment.   
---
I appreciated how communicative Blizzard was, and only quit because I realized I couldn't keep spending so much time on that game.   
---
For Guild Wars 2, I dip in around content patches, and doesn't get too involved as I have no idea of how long the game will go on, or what's in the near future. I could make a second legendary, but I don't see the point as I don't know if I will even keep playing in the near future despite it being one of my favourite franchise since GW1.
---
Finally we get the content that everyone has wanted! I can’t wait to play the game with this for hours on end!
---
/s
---
Good one
---
wow...thats some quality content.
---
What if I told you WoW has both
---
You could buy a Volatile Magic glyph from the TP, but they're pretty pricey. As for the other map currencies, you can buy them on Dragonfall, but it's limited to 5 per day of each.
---
The layoffs were in late February/early March, but I believe they announced LWS5 slightly earlier. That said, the layoffs and resulting restructuring will likely have slowed things down, which could explain some delays. I just wish they would be more communicative about it - a simple "we're delayed, this is why, this is our current plan" if they go over 10 weeks would work wonders for keeping people from flying off the handle.
---
oh Tekkit you finally did my idea of Fantastic Loot and where to find them :D
---
I remember this and it's exactly what i'm talking about, comparing this to my example i'd classify this as a "dev diary".  It's perfect for the ground work of player dev communication.  But my issue is they aren't following up on any of it (communication wise).  I'd love to see tiny updates on any of it every few weeks.  Like I said, it could be as tiny as a single picture of gif of a single piece from content or a feature tweeted out randomly.  Looking at the post you linked, there is tons of stuff on that list, drip feeding little behind the curtain peeks could last for months.
---
Another company that's really good at this is GGG with Path of Exile.  They announce an upcoming expansion/league, and then weeks and weeks after that announcement they drop teasers.  Sometimes it's just a picture of a single item.  Stuff like that gets the community's imagination going, gets players excited.
---
Oh nice! That not what I last heard about these so at least there is a route to get it fixed for those who don’t realize the binding shenanigans of those bags.
---
This argument is flawed. The best way to protest something is with your buck. If you force yourself to play something you don't like while paying for it, you won't be helping yourself and neither will they. If these issues are real, can be addressed, and aren't just toxicity, ArenaNet will be racing to hand out surveys to see what they can do to get the disenfranchised player back.
---
There is always a stream of new players who haven't played the game to the degree you've had. Trying to ruin their experience, the same one that presumably you enjoyed in your day, simply because you no longer do is just simply toxic.
---
If you just remain to complain and call people who disagree with you names, all you are doing is becoming focused on being toxic, which ends up defining you. If you instead and focus on something you can enjoy and be constructive with, you can keep your complaints and add value to them by taking your buck with you until they do you right while improving your own quality of life.
---
But a lot of this issue hangs on the validity of the complaints being raised. If you've played any game to completion, you will begin to get bored of it if you don't take breaks; you'd have to be hitting your head repeatedly against the wall not to. There are games that I've played that I consider classics, that are excellent, that I will likely never go back to because of how much I've exhausted them. If you take any singleplayer sandbox and finish it to 100% completion, you will lose interest in it, and an MMO is just something more people can play on at the same time. ArenaNet can only do so much to keep it interesting.

[For reals. I’m not throwing money at this game till I know another xpac is coming.](https://np.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/auzrce/lets_all_spend_50_ingame_today_february_26th_2019/ehbjeqh/)
---
I love the festivals, recycled? Sure,but I need content AND communication.
---
They don't have content ready yet, it's this or back to complaining about no updates.
---
The degree of whining in gaming communities varies wildly. There's a lot of whining in GW2's community largely because of how ANet handles things.
---
Look at Warframe. Sure people whine about the game, but I've never seen anything on the same level as what we're seeing now (or have seen in the past) with GW2. Warframe announces features and pushes for their game to constantly be better even when it might take months or years to materialize. People are OK with that because DE is clear about what the future of the game will look like.
---
Will Season 5 be any different from Season 4 (rushed releases, same type of content, frequent delays)? Will we ever get new fractal CMs? Are they even making raid wing 8? Are alliances still being worked on post-lay-offs? Are current events still a thing? Is expansion 3 on the table now that they've dropped their other projects? Do they have *any* comments at all on the current state of the game's balance across all game modes (especially since the last balance patch was a bunch of theoretical "tradeoff" nonsense that "fixed" non-issues and created new issues while ignoring actual game-impacting balance issues)?
---
I have *absolutely no idea* what the future of this game will look like. It was fine for a bit when Season 4 ended and they did a clean break with the story, but we've had a few months now with zero information.
---
Here are some examples of things that they could say to address some of these issues.
---
* Now that we have re-focused 100% on GW2, we are beginning work on a new expansion pack. It'll be a while before it launches, but we want you to know that we're committing to the game for the long haul.
---
* Season 5 is going to be different from Season 4 because of &lt;insert specific reason&gt;. (examples) We will add a new set of elite specs over the course of the season with one to two specs per episode. / We are focusing on revitalizing old content with fewer new maps and more changes to existing ones. / We liked the idea of Sun's Refuge, so we will have a permanent home base location for the entirety of the season that will tie into end-of-season-rewards and other plot developments. (Just tell us *something*.)
---
* We nerfed Chronomancer again because we feel that it still brings too much utility to the table in PvE while maintaining so many boons. We are working on adding new sources of quickness and alacrity with new elite specs for a future release, and these changes should help bring Chrono in line with a long-term sustainable version of the game with multiple boon-providing options.
---
* We acknowledge that Mirage is overperforming on certain raid fights. However, we like the tradeoff of high-confusion application for certain encounters. As a result, we will keep Mirage in place and support it with new condi options for Chronomancer as a second class for confusion-focused DPS. We are planning to round out this niche of confusion-focused DPS classes with additional options in the next round of elite specs. In the meantime, we are improving condi damage for several regular condi builds so there are reasons to run non-Mirage condis on fights less vulnerable to confusion.
---
* Raid wing 8 is in production. We built wings 6 and 7 as a unit so it might take another while for wing 8, but we are working on it.
---
* Alliances are still being worked on/have been tabled because we lacked resources after the lay-offs.
---
Other games have figured out how to give people good reasons to be optimistic even when nothing is happening. Meanwhile, GW2 has no visible future other than Season 5 which could end up being a whole bunch of new Kournas for all we know. There's still stuff for me to work on in the game, but it's hard to look too far in the future right now and feel comfortable committing a ton of time here.
---
In this case, not really "bitching about the way people complain" but rather pointing out that since there is so much pointless complaining, any usefulness that would come out of full open communitication would be nullified.
---
Ironically, you're bitching about others complaining, too. Worse, given you're complaining about people being tired of hearing constant complaining. Meaning all you're doing is making the issue larger with literally no purpose to it.
---
At least telling the original complainers to shut up serves a purpose and intent even if it remains unfulfilled.
---
You? You're just white noise. Pointless, without purpose, and disliked by everyone.
---
The only correct answer to all that "Anet is scared to communicate but that's okay uwu nobody should be forced to &lt;33"
---
Gg big brain :p
---
Same. They don't even have to go super-specific, they could just go long-term and vague with approximate releases dates like "the first chapter is planned for Q4 2019, and we started making content for the expansion, but we are not ready to show anything".
---
Last Winter's news of layoffs was not really encouraging despite it being rather common in the industry.
---
So what you really want is releases, not communication.
---
Just say that then.
---
That's ... What I was saying.
---
Yes why so serious! It's not like you're in a subreddit dedicated specifically to talking about said game or anything.
---
you also have to put into account how anet kind of pits the different player bases against each other. They spend all this time and resources on LS and raids that has very limited replayability. While leaving PVP and WvW high and dry for many years who have been replaying the same content for many years. Then anet blames the lack of resources for being able to implement certain requested features / changes for those game modes. Meanwhile the PVE'ers play their 2 weeks worth of content and disappear until the next content patch.
---
Then there's also how they killed dungeons, and kind of killed fractals too in favor of raids.
---
&gt; It’s not just 4x as popular as the main game. Osrs is competing for the number 1 spot of the most populated MMO on the market with WoW. 
---
Eh. I think that's pushing it.
---
It currently has 85k people online. Last we heard FFXIV was at 1.6m subs pre-shadowbringers IIRC.
---
I enjoyed OSRS for a long time and it's very punishing both in raids and PvP, It is a bipolar opposite of GW2.
---
What if I told you I think wow is shit?
---
Playing only PvP is an option. 
---
The reward tracks will allow you to get basically everything you could get from pve that is not collection specific (and there are PvP collections instead to keep you busy)
---
I am not bitching about you, I am pointing out how incredibly ironic your OP is.
---
Not gonna bitch about you even after what you wrote, it's not worthwhile.
---
It just shows the chair though, not how your character looks when sitting in it.
---
When will people learn never to pre-order? Sigh.
---
Why can't we have both?
---
&gt;People wanted festivals to fill in the content droughts.
---
Yes, but **we don't want longer countent droughts**, that's the whole goddamn point.
---
Where is LW5? We don't know anything about it. NOTHING. ArenaNet wants us to support a game which, for all we care, could shut down tomorrow.
---
What is the future of this game? The only relevant news we've gotten this year were the mass layoffs, dozens of employees getting fired and losing their livelihood, because management fucked it up.
---
You want me to trust the same company responsible for that fiasco, when they haven't even bothered to show public remorse for their mistakes? When they keep us in the dark, and expect us to just be there, waiting? For what, the same mistakes over and over again?
---
I’m impressed that you dug through my history to dig up that quote. And I’ve stood by it. I haven’t spent any money on this game since PoF since I haven’t seen any hint on a future xpac. 
---
That being said, this thread isn’t a call of action against Anet. It’s against the part of the community who use this line ANYTIME some one says something they disagree with. (Casual players more often than not). You can pretend the causal community is receptive to veteran players wishes, but that simply isn’t true, it’s met how I outlined. 
---
Additionally I didn’t call anyone names so not sure where that’s coming from.
---
I'm really enjoying ffxiv! :D I don't even mind the subscription fee. I'm on and off with gw2 with the goal of just getting legendaries and into raiding and wvw :3 but i know myself even better now that after crafting a leg or 2 or 3 I'm gonna shelf the game again. Now I'm kinda shelfing gw2 or I'm just gonna login and do raids with my static just to maintain my spot and after that I won't login till the next static raid run. And we only have 2 days dedicated to raids and only run for 2 hours max :3 
---
I think I'm sorta finally playing the game right.. super casual instead of playing it for hours and hours know the inevitable burn out is gonna happen xD 
---
I need referrals for ffxiv guys! :3
---
Indeed:-P
---
Bit of a weird one, but it's typically someone who engages with the game a lot, but never seeks out the traditional "hardcore" content.
---
People who play a ton but don't fractal/raid/etc
---
At this rate there won't be an expansion until 2021, if there's plans to make one at all in the first place.
---
What the fuck. At this point, I would support NCSOFT replacing the whole management of ArenaNet with a team of Korean overlords. For all I care, there's no fucking way they could do it worse.
---
I mean, it's probably normal and healthy to look for another game after playing something for years. There are so many other games in the world - if you're burnt out, just try something different.
---
You will get criticized anyways, that is a **FACT**
---
The reason you communicate the content, road maps or previews before hand is so that effective change can happen. People are allowed their chance at constructive criticism without being too harsh, why? Because its only a preview
---
The opposite is true once the content drops. Anet is very unlikely to change the content, and if they do, it will only be done as a small touch up a few months down the line while they pump out other content that has far more priority. When constructive criticism comes in, it would be because people are upset, and it will always be the case.
---
Don't carve a statue without letting your "client" know what it is, because once its done, you're gonna have a hard time slapping on new material when its simply easier to clip it away. You can maintain vast majority of control over it, like artistically, but don't deliver the finish product like it came in a mystery box.
---
if ur over lvl 22 there is a trait in the discipline line (warrior's sprint) that boosts your movement speed by 25% as long as u don't take silly weapons like rifle or longbow, which should boost your mobility significantly
---
It's not the game or Anet that makes me want to play less.  It's the community.
---
I feel like the goal of your post is to set out that we're all on the same team, but the content of your post seems to reinforce or push the narrative of division between story players and non story players
---
Play it blindfolded with white gear or make up your own challenges, if you want difficulty that badly.
---
I'll be honest, your post is as much of "bitching" as my first post is. So yeah, "you are what you criticize" indeed.
---
For OSRS? All of the above.
---
Boon chrono is fine but in CM firebrigade brings more overall dps than Chrono+druid. (This was true before the Nerf too it's just fewer chronos means more people trying to pug something other than Chrono+druid)
---
Healing by committee with a boon chrono would work and bring more Dps but isn't pug friendly. 
---
Druids still want a Chrono and druid+Chrono with a good Chrono is still very viable, so I don't think "dead" is right, but it's no longer the only choice for pugs.
---
So, a casual. Playtime doesn't equal hardcore.
---
This isn't even a good themepark, which makes it even more sadder. Why they don't focus on what made GW2 great in the first place baffles me to no end.
---
Where are the open world meta events? The jumping puzzles? The horizontal progression systems? The vertical maps? Where is all of that?
---
It's up to your preferred playstyle. Both work fine in open world, and are effective. Orr karma condi gear will make your warrior a tank, will kill things as long as you're patient. Berserker will make you kill things very fast, but you might be squishy, it's a playstyle of kill things fast before they kill you. A mix of berserker and soldier will have less damage but more survivability. It's really up to your playstyle, all 3 setups will do fine.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one feeling this way. I'm exactly burnt out from FILLER content. Could opt out of it, but hey, it's limited time, so must participate. My other mmo does the same boring rotation of events to the point where people got used to them and started losing interest or outright ignoring. I can't afford ignoring GW2 events since they're still somewhat of a new concept, but boy I wish they paced it out more healthily.
---
you were asked a question
---
how are you any different from what you complain about
---
you not only failed to answer, you simply cannot accept you are just a little bitch
---
The fuck?
---
Yes because it makes the class very clunky and also is a downgrade from core mesmer.
---
All tech, and nerdy fields are filled with consumers who are hypercritical of the corporations involved in those industries. It was a stereotype in the Simpsons before the internet with the comic shop guy who is ready to jump at correcting every specific detail, and the internet just made that rage and hyper-attention worse as we saw with gamers raging at DLC scandals like EA's Battlefront while the EA sports demographic just accept all those microtransactions being put in their games.   
---
It is certain that people on Reddit and some online tech news sites comment sections were irate at the removal of the audio jack and had their opinion reinforced due to the online echo chambers, while a lot of the "normal everyday" consumers were okay with the change.   
---
At least those tech companies seem to be listening and good at communicating their choices of new features,  which the community seems to appreciate. There are not that many gaming companies that seem good at listening and communicating, it is a lot of you get what we give you.
---
Nah, just really hopeful.
---
LW1 was more like 10 episodes, not 20. Remember that they always kept the finale outside the first release, and released it later. So we got patch 1, lasting 4 weeks, and 2 weeks later, patch 2, lasting 2 weeks and including the finale plus some bonus activities.
---
Even those half-assed patches felt better than many of the things we get now. Maybe they should go back to dividing the acts of each episode across two or more releases, at least it would help to build some momentum and people wouldn't rush everything in the first day.
---
Can't know before it's coming out. I'm prepared for a warmed up version from last year but I'm still hopeful. :b
---
Yes that's obvious and I agree with you, was I saying otherwise?
---
September, then Halloween, then Wintersday. So we're going to get what, one LW5 episode this year?
---
How the hell is this game going to survive like this?
---
EoC is better than the old combat tho, there is absolutely nothing to the legacy combat
---
Perhaps I should be more specifc - I'm not surprised that the Festival of the Four Winds came back, but that it came back before S5E1. I had figured they would have put out the new episode on the 30th and delayed the Festival by a few weeks, but apparently the decision-makers at ANet have a different plan in mind.
---
I love seeing posts like this! This is what's fun about this game.
---
Where are those stats from?
---
So that sounds like there is no repeatable content coming anytime soon.
---
It used to be that the stereotype of Vegans was that they were always in your face about it, guilting people and all that.
---
Then it sort of flipped, people complained about them so much that the people arguing that it's OK to eat meat were way more pushy and loud.
---
Now it's just a cocophony of people giving their take on others' dietary habits, even though nobody is asking.
---
Game not ded gaiz, here's a ridiculously long copy pasta explaining absolutely nothing but speculation is fact so give me upvotes :c
---
It's because while having a plan/roadmap -- they've no idea which will be done in what order.
---
Their point was that anet, for example with the original Halloween storyline, promised to add to festivals. 
---
then they stopped doing that. 
---
When they said they'd automate a lot of festivals, people were hoping for them to be able to add new content to them more easily. 
---
But we barely get anything from them, and "new shinies" are still minimal compared to what the gemstore releases within the festival weeks.
---
Eh. Last year it rather was. Sure they updated its story, but that was necessary since the Zephyrite were last seen crash landed. Same manner as how they updated the Halloween content with LA's reconstruction or Wintersday when they moved it to DR.
---
And last year they full out set it up and blatantly told us it was going to be "just another festival". Same with Dragon Bash being set up as annual.
---
Bazaar in 2013 did, but largely because during Season 1Anet was trying to make a bunch of reoccurring festivals while continuing the story so they mixed the two. Such plans ended up going belly up for a few years though. Festival 2014 kinda did with Aerin and the new ship, but that was more foreshadowing than LW involvement.
---
The references to Aurene were aubtle enough that I think they can leave them untouched despite her ascension as an Elder Dragon. Maybe an extra dialogue or two but nothing major.
---
Expressing that you're "not gonna dig up old shit" rings hollow when you've just accused them of said "old shit"
---
If you're a long time player, I guess it is weak.
---
As a returning player, holy crap there's a lot of stuff, feels like the game I wanted years ago. They just need to pull a move big enough to get people back in, then up the content release cadence.
---
&gt; I’m impressed that you dug through my history to dig up that quote
---
I like to know who I'm talking to. I've mentioned it because it illustrates a hypocrisy:
---
&gt; Why play retention matters and why players need to stop saying “you can always come back later”
---
&gt; This game relies on revenue from the gem store... this is even more so the case when it doesn’t develop expansions. We player retention starts to slip, less people buy gems as the revenue starts to slip. This is why quarterly losses occur systematically after expansions. Further revenue can lead to financial consequences for the company and in the long term lead to more lay-offs (or game shutting down. Or whatever).
---
&gt; And I’ve stood by it. I haven’t spent any money on this game since PoF since I haven’t seen any hint on a future xpac.
---
You don't want to spend gems because they won't release an expansion, but you want to criticize people because they might drive away the players who continue spending gems so you can continue playing a game you constantly have an issue with?
---
By your logic, "this game relies on revenue from the gem store" so you shouldn't be "encouraging it".
---
Don't get me wrong, like I've said, your argument is flawed. Feel free to not pay any gems if do want to place your buck where your mouth is and you think they should release an expansion before asking for people to spend money. But how you do that, well, reread my previous comment
---
&gt; who use this line 
---
Which line?
---
&gt; You can pretend the causal community is receptive to veteran players wishes, but that simply isn’t true, it’s met how I outlined.
---
That was never a point of my comment.
---
&gt; Additionally I didn’t call anyone names so not sure where that’s coming from.
---
This comment wasn't directed entirely at you, but you do use names and labels like "casuals" and "veterans" because you assume they either apply or can be defined and deduced that easily.
---
Tarrktun is the way to riches.
---
Eh, I've never started or stopped playing a game because a streamer did. But maybe I'm out of touch these days
---
[Dragonhunter](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/dragonhunter/power/). Powerful, easy to learn and fits all the boxes you listed.
---
i meant as in simply searching for those threads on the forum. i guess he can talk himself and simply say: no, that was not me.  
---
some names simply stick and you know already whats going on.
---
Oi! I remember that LFG site.
---
I can babytalk 2.
---
58 if you count seasonal ones.  
---
 [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jumping\_puzzle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jumping_puzzle)
---
That's such a ridiculous statement. You started up the game in a very stale time for the game so OF COURSE the subreddit is brewing more negativity from the lack of content to discuss and communication from the devs. This subreddit is actually infamous to be a circlejerk of positivity and being rabid to criticism. Your comment actually feeds into that by calling it 'constant incessant bitching'. You really haven't been around long enough to understand and I know that's gonna be hard to accept but that's the reality. As a new player, you simply aren't gonna have the same experience as 'veterans' are having right now so of course other people being negative about something you're enjoying is gonna be at odds with your feelings but you got to be more selfaware, friend.
---
And then you realize after 7 years of playing the game you didnt have to, at all
---
The problem I see more of is meta content needing multiple people getting harder to do if people dont show up.  I can remember 2 yes ago at 2:15 am PST finding a pretty full Dragonstand map waiting for the meta and recently once at 10-10:30 am PST finding 5 people on the map waiting.  Also, a recent TD at 9:30 pm PST (first map) struggled to get 8-10 in each squad.  AB/TD/DS metas need people and cannot be solo'd and I dont see Anet ever making a way for them to be solo'd in each lane.  Scaling adjustment may work, but may not with player apathy against pressing anything more than 1111.
---
  DS lately survives on getting 15 in each lane at times because of dedication and power creep, which to some degree amazes me; I remember 40+ squads breaking up because of pods resetting and the lane gets screwed over and no one wants to try again.  I do see DS is not run all the time anymore.
---
When HoT metas get to be like trying to do Triple Trouble there is a problem.
---
By my assessment, a longer-than-ideal gap between Living Story episodes + two Festivals extremely close together + the "World Boss rush" community event twice in about a month + FFXIV releasing a really solid expansion that drew some players away + a few prominent streamers and raiders moving on to new stuff = ded gaem, everybody panic!
---
Practically speaking the current situation is less than ideal, for a variety of reasons, but the game still makes bank and isn't going anywhere any time soon. Some people just like to freak out at the slightest provocation, I guess.
---
People like to whine on Reddit, nothing more or less. People actually playing the game are still enjoying themselves
---
What's confusing about it?
---
Anet communicated exactly what they're working on. Repeatedly saying "We're still working on these things" isn't useful for anyone -- it would actually only frustrate the situation. Look at WvW Alliances: it was communicated well in advance with no timeline attached. People constantly point to that as a sore spot, then turn around and demand more communication.
---
Ultimately, what people are upset about is the perceived lack of content releases. That's what people should be honest and direct about: "We want more frequent content releases." Just say that instead playing this silly game of demanding more communication only to get upset by what is or isn't being said.
---
&gt;2016
---
God fucking damn it.
---
A couple of snowballing effects.
---
-Anet layoffs cause general uncertainty about the game/company
---
-Dev comments on Twitter stating ANet was moving people off to other projects, and they were unsure if LS4 was the end.
---
These are the start of the unease lately.
---
Then:
---
-ANet shuts down communication on the future of the game. A single road map but no rough time lines or plans.
---
-What we DO get is Living World s5. Most people really want another expansion, as the game is best when there's a large amount of new content all at once, and it brings people into the game again.
---
And lastly:
---
-A small handful of high profile community members have announced they're moving to other games. Many are displeased at the lack of "hardcore" content, as raid wings take many months, and new fractals are all but stopped.
---
Dh, with scepter instead of lb. LB kinda sucks, but scepter doesn't.  If pugs you are playing with get you as condi slb on top dps spot, then with you are going to outdps them all at once.  Without much effort required.
---
I’ve never raided and I’ve been very vocal about the direction... so strong argument.
---
With the amount of gemstore crap they pump out every week. You would think they would be able to make 16 shiny weapon skins and be done with it.
---
But then again, non gemstore skins don't make $$$$$$$$$$$$
---
Let them taste their own medicine.
---
Folks will dog on Scrapper all day, but I enjoy it even now.
---
For open world, if you love hammer.
---
Berserker, Marauder or similar stats. Power and Precision are most important because you want good crit.
---
Scrapper bbb
---
Explosives btt
---
Firearms bbm
---
This gives you some nice burst and decent sustain. Use your hammer skills properly and slot in Rocket Boots for mobility; Elixir Gun for extra healing, stun break, and range when you need it; and Battering Ram for breakbars.
---
Sneak Gyro is OP AF. Avoid or leave combat at will every 30 seconds.
---
You can use the same build with pistols or rifle, just change traits in firearms away from the close range ones.
---
I use this all the time and it's great.
---
They already made learned recipes account-wide.
---
But they can't make discovered recipes yet, because they give XP people use to level up, and there's crafting licenses that allow a single character to have 4 crafting disciplines at the same time.
---
To make crafting fully account-wide, including discovered recipes, they would have to add a way to get extra XP for leveling characters without discovery, and a new use for crafting licenses.
---
That's such a bullshit way of framing it. The "actual criticisms" are so full of  "game is dying", "this is why the game is not more successful", and other hyperbole that *actual criticism* gets lost in the bullshit. The way you're framing it is as if there's a black/white and one side has to be right and the other wrong.
---
There's a ton of stuff which could stand to be redone/revisited in regards to gameplay and game systems. There's valid concerns with the business model, player retention, and update cadence which we have less information or tangible/actionable options for, too. There's also reasonable expectations that have been established in the past 7 years which should be used to temper your expectations of what can/should/will come next.
---
A bunch of those "criticisms" posted on this sub lately have been kind of ridiculous. Claiming the game is dying when we have quarterly stock holder reports and even third party stats like GW2Efficiency showing us otherwise. People claiming that GW2 needs more hardcore endgame content when the reality is that in most other games less than 20% of their subscription/player base even attempts it once *and* GW2 never really had that to start when things were supposedly better.
---
Likewise a lot of the defenses can be pretty dumb, too. Saying that everything is fine for you so it should be fine for everyone else makes about as much sense as saying birds can fly so you should too. Turns out GW2 has a huge variety of ways to play the game so the things you like might not be getting impacted but the things other people like are. If someone chooses to stop playing the game, what do you hope to accomplish by telling them their new game is worse? Are you just desperately trying to reaffirm you made the right choice in how to spend your game time?
---
So pick a side if you feel like you need to I guess. Or just, y'know, try and see the world through more perspective than the rut you got stuck in. This isn't really a black and white kind of situation.
---
I’m not in those echo chambers... but I’m still salty at the audio jack drop...  I don’t see it as anything other than a cost saving/cash grab tactic.  I decided to give it the college try and have found it quite annoying not having the “right” headphones with me if I grabbed a normal pair of headphones by mistake.
---
In game if you go to your Hero panel, go to Novelties and then under there go to Tonics and you can preview quite a few.
---
The writing was on the wall as early as 2013, but we had nowhere else to go.
---
I'm not even sure the game's business model will survive the incoming lootbox regulations, not with the same people in charge.
---
I actually have fond memories of original Festival of Four Winds. But that maybe because I just fucking love Sanctum Sprint and spent whole festival doing just that. A *lot* of disappointment was in me when I saw you get no rewards for it last year
---
&gt; We know LS5 is coming.
---
Which by far and bejond the most uncertain we have been since season 2. 
---
- When HoT was announced we "knew" ArenaNet was putting expansions on the table and always assumed another expac + Living World season was coming.
---
- After HoT released they announced their plan to have 2 teams, one working on expacs and one working LW seasons. At that point we knew we had another season and expac to look forward to. 
---
- When PoF came closer they announced that we would be going into LW season 4 right after.
---
The problem at this point was that this is where the communication mostly stops. We learned half way through season 4, that we would *not* be getting another expac and instead be going right into season 5 instead. That's about 6-8 months before people expected to play another expac. And since then we have had complete and absolute radio silence regarding the future of this game and anyone who tries to argue differently usually has to grasp at straws like the april announcement. 
---
The simple fact of the matter is that we have absolutely no clue if there is *anything* past season 5, whereas for the past 3 years we always knew there would be something after the next step. They have literally not used the word "expansion" in any public statement or comment for the past 1.5-2 years. Whenever they are pressured for "what does the future of GW2 look like" they avoid any and all actual answer with "We always planned on going right into season 5 and are planning to deliver great content for years to come". [GW1](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Game_updates:2019) received about 10 patches this year, one of which was a genuine content patch with actual new items and some quality of life. The statement they have been using to describe Guild Wars 2's future 100% fits for GW1 in its current state and that doesn't give me a hell of a lot of confidence about this games future, especially considering the layoffs + the rumors about Anet working on other games before those layoffs. 
---
The greates cause for optimism these days is NCSofts demands for a "refocus on Guild Wars 2" in one of their conference calls, but considering that they demanded "smaller and faster expansion releases" after HoT's release and we all know where that went, I don't put all too much trust into these conference calls.
---
It would be so hillariously easy for Anet to increase player trust and optimism with a single statement describing a roadmap past Living World season 5. "Hey guys, just wanted to let you all know that we have officially started to work on expac 3. Eta is 2-3 months after season 5, but due to the time and stage of development this is subject to change over the coming year. Excited to let you all know about some of our new and exciting features at a later date." That's pretty much all, most of us want to hear and it is about as non-committal as you can get. But I guess saying literally nothing for close to a year now is also a way to communicate with your community...
---
I dont find myself to be a fan of you personally but I do enjoy your little videos and skits 
---
so welcome back
---
Imagine caring. Oh, I don't.
---
&gt;More like 80/90% of poeple skip out on fights with equal numbers.
---
I know right?
---
Didn't wan to sound too frustrated but nobody fights the usual 1v1 solo roamer especially since they're most likely something akin of Marauder Spellbreaker with Rune of Durability. Slut mog human female with blue hair, cat ears and scarf.
---
Some nasty dueller like that you have no real odds of beating anytime soon and who will most likely dip you into downed.
---
&gt; What is fun about 2v1? 
---
You pick one player of their party and dismounting them, therefore forcing the others to either let their mate die or joining the fight.
---
True 1v1 is dead you said it yourself - allmost all people dodge you, now you need to cheese and force fights!
---
not really in 2013, maybe for wvw yes but hot at least gave us something over there (even though the map wasn't great, the rest was pretty much fine)
---
when they decided to 180° from a hard expansion which still has players playing into a full casual single player clownfiesta that pof is, that's where we saw that coming (and many quit back then) but still believed anyway... still even after the rework there are 0 reasons to go there ever.
---
take my Fucking ARROW UP you sexy fellow veteran brother!   
---
...They just won't understand.
---
Oh most likely.
---
But it still struck me funny that in all this time they still never bothered to go back to do it but just the same I've never gone back to do any of the others.
---
Didn’t they COMMUNICATE what they were working on? Living world, legendary sigils, wvw, some other stuff I don’t remember. What exactly is this thread about? Communicating every month that it’s not ready or a concrete release date.
---
That'll wear off
---
Exactly this.
---
The same fanboys who hated gear progression, but loved ascended gear and infusions when they were announced.
---
The same fanboys who whined about the idea of a PvE wardrobe, because it would be bad for the gem store, and then applauded it when it was actually implemented.
---
The same fanboys who hated on raids because they were exclusionary, then became "expert raiders" and started hating on everyone clamoring for raid difficulty modes.
---
The same fanboys who hated on mounts, even during the leaks, and then went full 180 when PoF released.
---
Zealots of the status quo, they pretend to care about the game, but the only thing they care about is their cause; a cause where they must be right, even if it costs the game its life. The game's true cancer, dragging it down into irrelevancy.
---
Daredevil :p
---
Go ingame, and open your wardrobe.
---
&gt; Do people forget what they just went through
---
Do people forget that Anet shot themselves in the feet, leaving GW2 on a skeleton crew while most devs were relocated to side projects. They (not the fired devs, but the management) got right what they deserved. The outrage isn't a recent thing, it was building up for some time now.
---
Beautiful
---
200 IQ play
---
My problem here is more, that the "results" on boths sides have no base. There are allegations and numbers in % and stuff, but no sources, confirmation or anything. 
---
I mean one of this points could be "enlarges you genitals" and it would be as trustfull as it is now.
---
&gt;. It was pitched as this thing that would encourage exploration, but it punished exploration
---
This is completely false. On launch they DID reward exploration. You need to explore and kill different things because the chance for all the cosmetic and extra rewards was tied to what you kill. If you just rush through like most people did and killed the big guys by azerite nodes and speed moded it you didn't get rewards.
---
Eventually people bitched about this enough and Blizzard removed the exploration aspect and now the rewards were tied to what spawned on the island, not what youa ctually found and killed. So on launch they did exactly what they said they would do. Then people bitched they didn't like it that way.
---
It's realistic
---
Well it is easy to show stuff in pure farming game, but here 90% of stuff is spoilers.
---
i mean every recent ls episode i played through within max 4 hours while turning of my brain while pressing 1 and f.  
---
It's just boring content that ppl who want to have a challenge dont enjoy.   
---
with the current release pattern of raids and fractals and now with them saying there wont be another pof raid the next one is in 1 and half years best, there is just frustration everywhere
---
That crisscross meditative position for legs looks cool in theory, but it stretches skirts/buttcapes in horrible ways. Full skirts become a large inflated mess, frontflaps get gigantic and dangle in the front, and backskirts clip and turn into hemispheres.
---
Quite a pity for an, essentially, cultural chair that's expected to look best on sylvari :(
---
Ingame bugs? Lets just remove the bugged content! No more bugs!

[Rifle Deadeye](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/deadeye/rifle/) might do what you want.  It primarily uses a ranged weapon, has a shadow step away from your target, includes some CC skills, and does workable damage against a lot of things.
---
I don't know of an Ele build that exactly fits what you want, but as an alt you might appreciate [Boon Ele](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/boon/).  It has one of the simplest Ele rotations, it has some CCs, and most of its attacks can be used from medium range if needed.  Also, for Open World, use Mango Pie or something similar to stay up.
---
Every source I've seen seems to agree that none of the people who were laid off were working on GW2, so at the very least it isn't any worse off now. I also think it's fairly safe to say that they didn't just lay off everyone working on the other projects, and they have done a bit of hiring since then, so unless I'm missing something major it's pretty much guaranteed that GW2 currently has more people working on it than it did in February.
---
Yep, just your average every day reasonable consumer opinion packaged in utter disdain for the same developers you are trying to get information from. Can't imagine why the devs would think openness with communities like Reddit wouldn't be the best policy...
---
Universal unidentified gear has only ruined the loot even further.
---
I don't know much about that streamer, I only saw one video of him ranting about LS. Aside from insults and rant he complained about thing that were just wrong. All he rant about were just lies.

---
Bringing in raids was Anets greatest mistake. They bore actual raiders, provide no challenge for them and have far to few releases to keep them interested, and alienate casuals. Way to frustrate both player types with one stone.  
---
Either do them properly, or not at all. This one-size-fits-all, once-a-year bullshit does *nothing* for the game.
---
Now that's some interesting bug.
---
The invulnerability didn't go away even after wiping?
---
That's correct!
---
WvW is difficult too.
---
The spirit required to play it constantly after so many years of neglection is nothing short of hardcore.
---
On the other hand, you get a chair + blanket combo
---
Female human meta?
---
This is the first time they did it, usually they respected language barriers, but they tried to balance population with this change.
---
That's why I said to join some more populated international server because they have established english speaking community.
---
Mimic would be such a cool theme for some mesmer elite specialization.
---
&gt; it means the next release will seemingly get pushed back even further
---
Pushed back from what? They didn't announce a date. Nothing is being moved around. This has all been predetermined for months and months now. It's not like they were going to release the episode now, then remembered there's supposed to be a holiday and pushed back the episode. We knew this the whole time. The festivals are on a rotating cycle of every other month:  
---
January
---
February - LNY
---
March
---
April - SAB
---
May
---
June - Dragon Bash
---
July
---
August - Four Winds
---
September
---
October - Halloween
---
November
---
December - Wintersday
---
I guess deimos at 10% after it becomes invulnerable either gets a /kill command or gets ported somewhere else on the map, and you fight the big him below.
---
So one of the cases above failed to execute and i assume wiping wouldn't ever get rid of him.
---
Okay. I didn't knew about that. Thanks.
---
but it is dying wtf
---
Yep
---
Keep Gourdon away and safe! He needs his relaxation.....
---
The numbers are also kind of counter-argumentative, particularly when you consider the flip side. Like, it shows that 59% will continue doing business with the company and 62% will NOT switch to competitors (wait, what? Why is there that 3% discrepancy between analogous terms?)
---
My friendlist mostly consists of casual/semi-hardcore players like me. My friendlist is now a graveyard with only a few super dedicated ones popping up for daily routine, but even they aren't happy about the current game state.
---
I don't understand why these are not account bound...
---
Lol because it's my job to buy shit I don't want to keep the game alive? and not the company's job to offer me good products that I'll WANT to buy? How cucked are you by anet exactly?
---
This is why there should be more pants &gt;_&gt;
---
Two month old account on a personal crusade against the game, evil retarded casuals, and the devs.
---
There is no cloth animation in this game. The pose also looks like they took the  T-pose, adjusted the arms and bent the legs... the upper body looks so stiff.
---
I think GW3 is the way to go too, just because GW2 made a lot of mistakes and lost a lot of people during release.
---
Handle GW3 as a GW2.5 of sorts, recycling assets, and release a new game with all the cool stuff we have now, from the wardrobe to mounts.
---
Condi weaver is currently the strongest dps build, but mirage may still outdps it on certain bosses.
---
Power dh and weaver are very strong as well and bs warrior is mandatory anyway.
---
Can you elaborate more?
---
Am I the only one who is confused at the numbers in statistics that really don't support what the title claims?
---
38% switched to competitor or stopped service, means 62% still stuck with them.
---
49% of positive reviews, mean 51% still consist of neutral, bad or no reviews.
---
I'm all for company being a good communicator with customers, unless I'm underestimating the numbers here, but this chart...has some flawed statistics that doesn't really convey the importance of communication. It says "even if the company does a good job, the there is a 50% chance that customer doesn't really care".
---
&gt;  but it's times like these where you can see how fragmented the community is
---
Keep in mind that this is limited to reddit only, which is less than 20% of the actual GW2 community. Most players don't write or even use reddit or similar forums.
---
That is also sort of silly. The festival is anual and was expected to come out and very likely prepered and added before summer vacations to activate on next Tuesday. 
---
I mean you have to realise that this is a company, and they have their plans, their vacations and reacting and changing stuff is nothing that is going to happen in a few days.
---
True. I always see those festivals as "something to do" at least, even better when it involves the community.  
---
For example in the past I played a lot Maplestory, and while the game have many flaws,. especially thanks to nexon's management, I have to admit that I just loved how there was one event after another...sometimes giving you really strong equips, other times chairs, skins and other stuff, but still...you always had something to do.
---
Nowadays, it's like we need a chef degree to tell our steak tastes like shit.
---
It wasn't based on exploration, it was based on killing enemy types.
---
Since the enemy types were spread out through the maps pretty randomly, there wasn't much need to really explore to find certain types.
---
Also, since you're grinding them out multiple times a week, anyway, it was pretty obvious to just kill everything you needed to for azerite nodes, finish fast, and hope the RNG covers it.
---
Had they put elites that would actually drop loot, rather than their "It's all RNG anyway so you might as well go for more rolls" setup, it might've actually been mildly fun.

Thread removed: Stirring up drama is not allowed.

What exactly do you need to know? They already told us Living World updates come every 3 months. Last update was 2 months ago hence LW5 starts in a month time. Episode 2 releases in November episode 3 launches march 2020, episode 4 -  June 2020, episode 5  -  September 2020, episode 6 - December 2020
---
Also if they plan to launch a new expansion it will likely launch march 2021
---
I honestly dont get why people are acting like the world is ending any second! 
---
Thing is 
---
This is not a content drought, its the normal span between episode releases
---
we're not in the dark we know the release schedule with quite good accuracy up to March 2021 only question we dont really know is will they launch a new expansion or start season 6 really?
---
Yes they sometimes go over the 3 month line by a week or 2 but for the most part we accurate know whats coming to a level other MMOs can only dream off yet you think we're totally in the dark? Dont you think thats exactly true?
---
I'm sorry, did you even read the post? the only one "shitposting" here is people like you who skim through it and just go "you're not being nice enough".
---
Ja stimmt genau
---
They show stuff for upcoming story quests tho.  Out of context screens is usually what they do.  Or they show assets that haven't even been textured yet, example, they'll show a weapon in pure 3d model form, just to show off what it looks like.  There is no textures no background nothing, it's just a 3d model sitting on a blank canvas.  Doesn't tell you anything about where it comes from, what it's made of, how you get it, does it come from the story quest? was it wielded by the villain? nothing.  But people see it and they go "dang that's cool, i can't wait to see what it looks like finished and how it plays"
---
It didn't exist until a few years ago, to be fair. Some time between HoT and the PoF drop, I don't remember exactly when it was implemented. 
---
It always irritates me to not have the drop to unlock the collection, because I made frostfang back when you had to make one of the corrupted weapon skins. Eventually I will gaf enough to buy it, but not today.
---
I kept playing, but I hate the warclaw too. Mounts in pvp modes are stupid, period. It even sounded stupid on paper but Anet went for it. But yay, they made some money with warclaw skins?..
---
Yes, exactly this. It's the silence that's the big issue.
---
Exactly this ^
---
Pikawot?
---
THATS WHAT ITS CALLED!?!!!
---
While the primary issue was indeed the devs being burned out due to being in constant shipping mode - something very, very unhealthy for devs - players being burned out due to constantly having limited time content, skins, and achievements to complete/obtain was definitely a fairly big issue during S1. Maybe not one that ArenaNet openly commented upon, but it was there.
---
Regardless of the community events, I would still argue that having two festivals less than half a month apart is not a good thing. Even if Season 5 weren't ready to launch within a week or two, I'd still imagine delaying Four Winds to make it an anniversary (late August) festival would have been the better move from a long-term perspective.
---
I want to ride on the back of a Sylvari!
---
Haven't bought anything for some time with ESO and I completely forgot you can get the other previous expansions if you buy the current one but there are no dlc's included.
---
   That super bundle is long gone so you can't buy the base game, expansions, and the Guilds and Glory dlc pack as one anymore.  To access those you either sub or buy their pack for $30, or each separately if you don't want/need all 4. 
---
  Also there are currently 7 separate dlc's to pay for (and another coming shortly) if you don't sub or want to have access to if your sub lapses.   With ESO you have to pay cash for all content releases in one way or another, they don't give content out for free with the exception of Murkmire if you logged in every day in November 2018.  That however was still a paid dlc when it was launched, and still have to pay to access it today.
---
 I heard about the recolored horse, pet, and house for running around visiting a few poi in the new expansion during their Summerfall event during launch month, but that isn't free content.
---
Like WoW. 
---
Or literally every mmo or game ever made.
---
And again your throw shit around you. Let me remind you then that they actaully fixed HoT after complaints from the players. They did a really huge fix and turned it all around. But maybe you forgot that?
---
I'm not talking about festivals and events, I'm talking about the next season or announcements being made while or shortly after the festival.
---
 You should get your facts right before you post such BS
---
&gt; and there's been no communication about the content plan for GW2 since.
---
and that's a blatant lie.
---
&gt; You can maintain vast majority of control over it, like artistically, but don't deliver the finish product like it came in a mystery box.
---
That's it, we got them! LW episodes were just lootboxes all along!
---
Idk, if people on reddit give certain statements, they mostly (from what I see) bring sources with it to confirm that they are right.
---
I guess it comes down to personal preference. There have been repeated events in the past, and there are some items that can be purchased from the market board; in the case of dyes, there are non-cash shop versions available.
---
For me, I don’t like items being repeated every year so I’d rather new items, but for new players having a way to buy them in-game during an event would be nice (which I believe they did for a couple summer events in the past).
---
Neither system is perfect, but I personally prefer FF14 to GW2. I don’t feel like I’m missing out if I don’t buy a cash shop item on 14 because there’s a ton of in-game content available, but I didn’t feel that from GW2.
---
I believe you, that you didn't fake this graphic, but a source should be on the graph or anywhere easy to see. 
---
Posting it under my comment won't help much.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I started playing during beta and have been playing since then without taking any breaks and I am still enjoying. So yeah dont assume people stop enjoying the game a few months into it.
---
&gt; No Man Sky:
---
&gt; 0 Communication after Launch but tons of action behind the scenes, completely turned it around. The Comeback Kid that nobody talks about.
---
Geez, I wonder why. I guess it will remain a mystery!
---
Sounds scarily familiar.
---
I prefer to keep TacO on the real-time "tactical" side (whether it be tactical in an action sense or with the tp tracker in the business sense) and try to avoid the kitchen sink effect :)
---
Honestly you're a fucking moron if you think that post was meant to "stirr up drama", and not an honest opinion on the absolute abyssmal state of the game. 
---
Why didn't you remove the pikachu meme then if you don't want drama and/or low effort/value posts?
---
Can I have some of your table scraps? :D
---
Well, I guess they should shut down the whole company and run into the woods, since they're gonna get criticized anyway.
---
Assumptions add nothing.
---
It's basic business. This game doesn't have a subscription model. What they offer is the gem store instead.
---
If there's nothing to buy then simply don't buy it. 
---
My point is, in that case, don't get so upset just because another player bought a skin for a mount or chair that you didn't. 
---
If you want people to understand your POV, being hostile isn't the way to do it.
---
Found and fixed.
---
Tjey prpb dont commu icate because we possibly couldnt like what they have to tell us in some cases (like wing 8 or expac 3)
---
That was more than 3 years ago ffs.
---
It 100% is.
---
It's fine when they do it, they're on the right side of history!
---
So just shut up and enjoy the game, or leave!
---
"I want to be judged for what I deliver, not what I promise" - Mark O' Brien

Yeah, the grind to get to the endgame is tedious, but OSRS isn't actually that bad when it comes to combat in the late game areas and vs late game bosses.  Zulrah, Vorkath, The inferno, The Wildy bosses, Alchemical hydra, the farming boss, and the mimic clue boss are all pretty great.  Just wish I could do more than afk skills to max so I can experience that content, lmao.
---
furnace taken
---
Omg the hastags
---
All those baskets of harvestable crystals... I thought it would help me with the DragonScale quest... bu I need CHARGED crystals... I just should have been charging one every day I played...  
---
The Four winds will just give me more Crystals to charge.
---
And what experience is that, might I ask? Mine is from working in the game industry and having a strong understanding of the communication process. Don't take that as some sort of statement of superiority; I'm being genuinely neutral here.
---
&gt;Warframe = updated/balanced every few weeks
---
If only, Warframe is having the same problem GW2 is having, but their community hates veterans so they've all gone and the state of the game is slipping.
---
WoW's system is the perfect one. GW2 is to an extent as well. GW2 lets you buy everything you could before but doesnt always add new things because cash shop
---
WoW adds new things every year while still also letting you get the old things.
---
XIV is the outlier in that they will make new items, but anything from the old events you have to buy on the cash shop.
---
Can I get a source for what OP posted?
---
hi chat
---
Honestly if you were in Anet's shoes, would you really support PvP or WvW actively?
---
Just look at this subs response to anything related to the subject. It's generally negative. So as a company what I would see is that this game mode is not liked by a large section of my audience.
---
Calling out arenanet for not sticking to their word and don’t communicate at all with the playerbase after they used us for advertising their own product and now even the subreddit get censored.
---
The real problem is that all content after pof took way to long and most of it was non replayable story content.
---
Ep6 was a great release but it’s to little to late and anet don’t give a shit about communicating with us except the release is sooner and the want to hype up their quarterly cashcow
---
I never said OSRS was more complicated than XIV lol.
---
Wait, is criticism being silenced?
---
Creating the illusion that everyone is happy is just that. An illusion.
---
&gt; Facts are facts and gw2 lacks shit tons of content in all areas.
---
Lacking content has got nothing to do with your silly assertions.
---
personal story does give quite a bit of xp, but it's entirely possible to get to 80 without them (and possibly even faster to skip them) 
---
regarding map objectives, the hearts are plain boring. they're not meant to be the main method of leveling. instead do any dynamic events you see, and simply by exploring the maps and getting the waypoints and such can get u a lot of xp.
---
trash mobs whose icons are in yellow text generally reward significant amounts of xp also, and this food (bowl of candy corn custard) gives u +15% xp from kills, pretty much the best for its price
---
This, deserves all of the upvotes.
---
Maybe apply same treatment to LOVE4ARENANET posts? New player coming back? Finally after 10 years finished X? Great job on X, Arenanet?
---
Treat positive posts the same as negative ones. If you're not it's censorship.
---
OMEGALUL
---
A **lot** of the devs behind the original release work of gw1 and gw2 are now gone. Additionally, anet goals have shifted from highly competitive pvp to casual pve. This would heavily impact the direction of a potential gw3, making it much different than the feel we got from gw1 and gw2 at release.
---
I want the gw universe to live on with a brand new engine, but I'm afraid if what anet would make of it.
---
I think I would prefer a new IP. Lay the guildwars universe to rest.
---
Hey mods, careful. You're walking a fine line here. People come to the subreddit for the freedom to express things they cannot on the forums. And yes, that includes separate threads discussing similar topics, and yes, that includes negative opinions about the game.
---
If you take that freedom away from the one open forum we have to constructively criticize the game and discuss issues, then that is grounds for more pikachu-posting.
---
A simple distortion and... Ta-da
---
Maybe there's 10+ posts about one topic because it's really the only topic worth discussing?
---
A good example of great communication it's from GGG with path of exile. Their CEO will get on Reddit and be like "yeah we missed a timeline, yeah last league didn't go how we wanted, we'll do better next time" and gets huge responses.
---
The usual 1st leggy/I drew my character are drowned in the sea of « dead game » and « we need communication » post but ok sure, let’s have them step down. 
---
I assume you’d volunteer to take over on your free time then?
---
Do you even know what game you are "playing"? Must I explain it all? If they had any idea besides "cater to every single casual" this would be a very very crowded game. RN its just a shitshow for gemstore items.
---
People are telling me "Furnace Taken" posts are being removed. Is this because they are referencing their migration to Wow Classic and that game's Molten Core raid? How is that a doom post? People migrate between MMOs all the time and this subreddit pushes the "Just take a break" meme pretty hard.
---
Thank you in advance.
---
&gt;Whether you relax by chilling out at the beach or blowing off steam in combat
---
That's not the only thing blowing. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
You are not critizining it at all, your a throwing a fit. Other players here have made well written post about the state of the game in which i have upvoted. They did not throw a fit they wrote what they thought was wrong, what could improve and asked for more comunications. That is the difference and why i might remember some of them in future discussions, whilst your fit throwing will end here.
---
Have a nice evening.
---
I'ts really sad that after a resurgence of actual marketing and hope to see stuff improving onward we've come to this in just few weeks.
---
I never had fun playing GW2 in the first place and i hope i won't have fun in WOW classic too.I wany my life to be miserable and terrible.

I don't understand why his post gets upvoted by people. Maybe they see a MOD and are like "oh he must be right". Not the sub gets censorship. 
---
If the community sees a problem like they did in the past 48 hours what does he want us to do? Stick everything in the same thread that will get buried and probably not even read by ANet? It's different when there are multiple threads.

It's like sending a single person to protest with the messages from 1000 people instead of all of them going out.

Honestly both this action and the choice of words of this Mod post are awful and wrongly misrepresents the sentiment of the commmunity.
---
Lots of game communities go through bad times and we had ours too ( anyone remember HoT announcement with an "high price tag"? ).
---
You, Mods, are not responsible for ArenaNet's lack of communication nor should act in this counterintuitive way, because even if the posts being upvoted are all doom and gloom it's because there are people who upvote.
---
Surely, we could say it can be bots, or a raid from other communities or even too much loud for our standars, but I've seen lenghty posts with actual discussions here and thoughtful opinions clashing mostly in a healthy yet emotional way.
---
I don't usually comment on Mod Posts like this, but I do feel like telling you this here is important because it does look like you're covering up a situation that you are not responsible for in a hurtful way for a community I'm in.
---
I do hope you reconsider.
---
You are awfull...
---
We've all been dying for a long time too.
---
Am I supposed to laugh? Very cringe, sorry.
---
I feel inclined to actually speak up right now exactly because of this. And, judging by the look of the frontpage, many others feel the same. It's such a rare sight. Of course it's also a shitshow and potentially it hurts the game's public image, but that's on Anet honestly. Direct result of their mismanagement and lack of communication.
---
game is 12+ so not all :/
---
Let's be honest it's not new people...
---
Reset after reset I see the same names failing to dodge the Tarnished Traitor's AOE in underground Tarir after the meta. These people are not interested in learning or helping, just want to leech rewards with minimal effort.

"Then again it's not inherently Anet's task to do such a thing."
---
It's not up to the creators of the game to harbour a community for the game they've created by offering said community tools to prosper? 
---
You're an idiot.
---
Damn this subreddit turned really cynical all of a sudden, what is going on.
---
I’ll never forget how anti-mount and anti-raid people in this game were. In fact people still are anti-raid, and I’ve never seen any other MMO community be so malicious about it.
---
What I find interesting is that WoW raids are more difficult than GW2 raids, and yet the former’s raids are more accessible than the latter’s.
---
Shouldn’t GW2 raids be more accessible because of their lower difficulty? You can’t spam 1 like on world bosses, but WoW is the same in that you can’t complete LFR (the easiest raid mode) by just autoattacking. The difficulty seems relative (the bar is lower but still not jumped over in GW2 because the bar is even lower in other areas and creates a low standard e.g. world bosses) which brings me into the next point.
---
Is it a community perception/lack of player skill in the general community that stops them from doing GW2 raids? 
---
OR is it because raids are a staple piece of WoW, and so many dip their feet in and try raiding because it’s constantly updated and there to be experienced? Whereas GW2’s raid development has dried up. I imagine it’s a mixture of all of these reasons.
---
&gt; eventually
---
The bittersweetest word in the dictionary.
---
It's a totally different mentality for veteran players to have something to look forward too (content wise) while logging in and doing you daily stuff. Or else you lose interest and keeps pilling up. We know something - "something" is coming like LW5 but we don't know what we really can expect with it!?
---
Remember when we got leaks about PoF, those were good days, that was the bone that many players wanted to keep them engaged with the game.
---
Skimming the future plans and further future plans highlight wvw restructuring, legendary sigils, cooking updates, and build templates. Outside of wvw I don’t see any of that as future plans are supposed to engage a player in a meaningful amount of game time.
---
You could argue build templates will open up the ease of switching specs for classes to go from support/dps/tank but I don’t think it would be a good player retention update.
---
You could also argue about the implied work on S5 but that is also what is being missed out on as far as communication. Have some PTR for stuff and keep the players involved even at a level of legendary sigils/build template feedback loop. Better than just plopping a feature out and get negative backlash about it because players were never included in how the feature would be beneficial to them.
---
Nice try Anet, trying to sell gems for transfers.
---
all this talk about needing communication and being unhappy with the game and the content and wah wah wah omfg you entitled people anymore jesus you realize gw2 is free to play game right that just recently fired over 100 people you mongoloids if you don't like the game or how gw2 has done shit then fuck off and quit go play another game nobody fucking cares quit trying to get attention over it gw2 isn't going anywhere with or without you normally I don't post on reddit but wtf also just saying its posts like this why nobody really cares what reddit posts and forum posts say about the game cus most of yalls retarded and dumb af your just entitled children that thinks they know everything (its a figure of speech to the morons that's about to type that your an adult if that's the case then its even worse for you mr grown up) iv played this game since the start with small breaks inbetween my advice to anyone with this game has always been that this game is the casual players mmo if you wanting hard challenging content this isn't the game for you if you want competitive content this isn't for you if you want a game with amazing graphics fun combat cool story and plenty to do besides what these idiots wanna act like theres plenty to do ya just cant ever please everyone you people cry about no communication yall know there is a weekly stream twice a week from anet over at [twitch.tv/guildwars2](https://twitch.tv/guildwars2) where you can ask anet all your questions sry if this came across toxic but some of yalls just need to go cus your just hurting the game and actual players that love this game don't want you here so good riddance monkey enjoy FF or classic WoW for a few months before you come crawling back
---
You're still missing my point. Read my first comment again, please.
---
the na wvw scene is better than eu
---
Oh, without a doubt, it’s great for the company.  You even get some people that appreciate the individual that makes the communication...  
---
but those devs also have to handle all the whiny, entitled comments from gamers who have no social skills or control over their emotions and that’s psychologically taxing.
---
This is what I don't think people understand. There's a difference between criticism, and negativity.
---
What people are being lately is full on negative.
---
Think of it of a new comer to the game. If you see "Anet is doing nothing to hold the interest of WvW/raid/fractal vets who been running this content for years. There's not much of a reason to play this content outside of just finding it fun after you've been doing it for so long" you'll probably still be interested in trying the game. It's issue are holding interest years down the line, that's not something you as a new player will have a problem with.
---
However, if you see "Anet never adds any content, raids are dead, WvW is dead, PvP is dead, they don't know how to run a business, the game sucks, the company sucks, and there's zero reason to ever play it" then new players will think there's no reason to even start it up. It's objectively untrue, we get content, a fair bit, it's just not spread the way some people wish it was. It's not done in a way 100% of the community agrees with. It's not an issue that new players will run into.
---
What players are hitting right now, is regular old fatigue. And Anet is having a few issues with resolving that, but it happens to every game, every MMO. The game is 7 years old. If you've been playing this as you're main game for 7 years, it doesn't matter how many raids Anet throws in here, you're going to feel that fatigue.
---
People are acting like other games (namely FFXIV) don't have this problem. They do. Was playing since 1.0, quit for good about a year ago. The same shit happens there. You hit a content drought, a lot of people stop logging in every day, your guild members start playing other MMOs, and everyone starts bitching about the raids being to easy, the game is too casual, SE isn't releasing enough new content, and the game is dying. Just look! Only 5 people in our FC logged in today!
---
The only difference, it hits other games harder. XIV might have more raids, more dungeons, and primal fights, but only a handful are ever really relevant. This is what caused me to quit. I'd log in, do my dailies quick, then run out of ideas on what there is to do. Can't gear up a new class, cause I need those tokens for Dark Knight. No point in running that old raid, no one's joining. I guess I could PvP, but I can't stand playing that one single map another time. Can't fuck around in the open world, cause there's not a single soul out there. I guess I could queue for an old primal fight, but that's gonna take 30-40 minutes to get a group, and chances are no one will know what's going on.
---
I guess I'm kinda going off point here now, but what I'm trying to say is GW2 at least keeps all of its content relevant. While we might get less content than XIV, at least it never dies, and is always unique unlike the straight line dungeons of XIV. While ESO might get new DLC every 3 hours, it also cost money and has shitty combat. The pains of fatigue and content drought hit all MMOs. It happens in XIV. It will happen again there soon once the high of a new expansion wears off, and they hit their drought.
---
The shining light here at least, we are dealing with a focused Anet now. Yeah, they had their layoffs, and that caused some shakeups at the company, but now this is all they have going for them. It's this or nothing. We've been seeing the new focus from them in the form of now communication and transparency, and that random and sudden advertising campaigns that have been direly missing for the last 7 years. It might take a few months for this to fully kick in, but I believe we will see a revitalizing future for GW2.
---
Inb4mods delete it
---
This is one of the only reasons I can think of for what's going on. Remember that in the aftermath of the layoffs, they were actually communicating much, much better and more often than they had in the past. Then, after a little while, it went to almost total silence apart from the occasional announcement about and upcoming special event. Certainly there could be better explanations, but the idea that they really just don't know what they are going to do or be able to do is the most obvious.
---
God I remember that. That was the final nail in the coffin for me, and to ensure I would never be tempted to log into RS again I sold all of my partyhats and had a friend buy all my rsgp (I think he paid me 0.27/mil at the time? He was flipping it for a profit on PA). I did try out OSRS and I loved it a lot, but I didn't last very long because when that launched in the beginning it was bombed with bots and Jagex were taking a totally hands-off approach to it at first.
---
Now looking at OSRS, it has a sizable dev team and they're churning out new content and doing a great job at interacting with the community on reddit, forums, youtube, and generally any venue of communication they can. They're making themselves a great example for other gaming studios to follow.
---
Things they communicated after lay offs was repeating the stuff we already knew were in the making year ago (alliances even longer). So, if we compare what we know about future content year ago and now, we know exactly the same.
---
Is a year enough for you to justify questions about content or we still give them another 4-6 months, just so they can get comfy with their schedules?
---
They deleted the Mod Post.
---
But this was never the case before, why now?
---
They only brought teaser for legendary weapons and those are completed now. 
---
It's now just the same as it was between ep 5 and 6 as it was between ep 4 and 5 as it was between ep 1 and 2 of LS4. Sure it's a new season, but they already said it will be a normal segue. 
---
This streamer who leaves GW2 and his fans spreading enough drama atm, I think we should put even more into this artifical fire.
---
To a lot of this community. Perception is reality I guess. “I’m having fun! Everything must be fine!”
---
Communication with the players is such a powerful positive force for the company that a lack of communication about future plans is a strong indicator that they think their plans would be poorly received by the players.
---
The previous instance of conspicuously not discussing future plans was when they had made the decision to cancel a 3rd expansion and pull resources from supporting GW2 to instead develop vaporware, after all.
---
In the absence of statements to the contrary that is exactly what I would assume their future direction is now as well.
---

How do i play if it's literally unplayable.
---
They're literally censoring the censorship
---
you clearly have no idea what the word "censorship" means.
---
We all knew this was gonna happen, what's the big deal? Be happy we had a 90% totally new festival with Dragon Bash 2019.
---
I'm sure they'll add plenty of stuff to Festival of the Four Winds like they did last time with plenty of new bosses.
---
Pussies all of them. Can't even stand up behind their own shit.
---
This subreddit is overrun by the fanbase of this one streamer, who leave GW2, and spreading much much drama, aso you can see. Of course it's hard to have serious discussions about this topic now.
---
Man i don\`t know what kind of nasa worthy internet you got but i actively avoid tarnished traitor due to the sheer amount of frames dropped when i enter the damn lag infested hole that is underground Tarir after meta....
---
For me, they just couldn't fire everyone just in one month. 
---
It is just a temporary act
---
Rewards. From a hero point. Hmmm..
---
Always pretend and fan from gw2 &amp; aNet, but last balance Patch destroyed it for me. All this changes to my classes: Chrono (muscle Memory for f5 and aegis), Holo (Power DpS nerf, scrapper traits what?),BS(loosing all Stab, other Elite Thema), DH (stacking sign buff). 
---
Now playing FFXIV and say Goodbye GW2
---
My concern is less that it’s jumping from festival to festival and more that the festival itself is just not as good as it could be. I got insanely bored with the last one because the rewards just aren’t there. Nothing new really outside of a few daily skin rewards that take 5 days or more. Very few decorations. And the Lab Cliffs is pretty much pointless outside of gambling. It feels like every festival just boils down to gambling for infusions with lackluster activities outside of SAB and Wintersday. I mean, Halloween isn’t that bad but all of them could be a little more engaging. For an even that’s meant to tide people over during breaks it would be nice to have more to do than press 1 a thousand times in a circle or press consumables in inventory for a measly 5 ap. And with everything that happened with Aurene and the festival being readded last year I would have expected a little more development with it but nothing about the announcement implies any changes.

i think the release of bless shows that a lot of people are just looking for a good mmorpg to get released
---
No it isn't.
---
The game doesn't encourage players to play together -&gt; Bad experience
---
I rarely play alone -&gt; I don't enjoy playing the game by myself, so I play with friends
---
So he rarely plays the game unless he has friends online because the game is too anti-group to allow for natural groups to form, and he doesn't enjoy playing alone (or effectively alone).

You have me confused with someone else, you fucking idiot xD

---
&gt; They no longer have another game in the works.
---
There's no confirmation on that either.
---
fact nuke
---
You never know whether they have something else in the works or not.
---
For example: the layoffs were late february, early march, we're now at the end of July and there hasn't been anything shown that would indicate that the developers, or middle/upper management (rumour goes around that the devs are super talented and the management regularly shits the bed) haven't learned a single thing.
---
Repeated filler content is dangerous. It's amazing, but only if there is something at the end to wait for but right now people are being kept in the dark again. No one knows if there is going to even be a raid (there is no one saying anything, which is why most people jump ship before they have to wait for 9 months, NINE MONTHS, before they get a piece of food to play with).
---
IDK, if I didn't care at all, I wouldn't even be here on the subreddit but I am enjoying my time currently elsewhere and I think that's fine. But I can also see me not returning anymore because I've noticed that, for me atleast, it has turned into logging in and wasting away time instead of doing something that's fun. And fun is what matters.
---
the devs are doing amazing things. i'm absolutely certain that most major issues the game and ultimately the company are facing currently are caused by management. i don't disagree with you, but this imo is an important distinction.
---
Or for that matter more/different bosses for the gauntlet.
---
He has nothing to do with this. He multiple times told people to not harass or post offensive memes.
---
50% is a lot.
---
GW2 could really use a 'refurbishing' team to rework old content that people usually just play once to make it more replayable.
---
When Hard Mode hit GW1, that was a ton of fun. Missions that used to be trivial and mundane became  a race to see who can figure out how to beat the fastest a bunch of level 24-30 enemies with a party of 4.   
---
Then we got the Lore Books to fill, that work kind of like the Dungeon Frequenter achievement, but with an option for better rewards if you complete more of it, and really good rewards if you fill it completely.  
---
When things began to slow down again, the tempting shinnies you could get from Zhaishen bounties gave them a new life again, and there's still people doing them up to this day.   
---
There's way too many missions in Personal Story to turn them all into something with level 80 full party levels of difficulty, but there's some missions that could use a few tweaks, particularly those everyone gets regardless of choice, like The Battle of Claw Island, Retribution, Forming the Pact, the Battle of Fort Trinity, and Victory or Death.
---
Gods know Zhaitan is in dire need of an actual final battle. Either by adding an extra final instance after Victory or Death, or adding a final open world instance inside Arah, in a fourth Orr map that works kind of like Dragon's Stand and Dragonfall, with players advancing towards the dragon at the same time as the story happens, and fight the dragon together.  It could be called "Dragon's End" to go with he "DragonX" naming theme. 
---
Expansions and living world also have many interesting instances that would be great with a "Dungeon mode", like the Hidden City of Fahranur.   
---
And it's a damn shame not being able to explore all of Gandara.   
---
Rata Primus is a rather interesting Labyrinth, but there's not that many reasons to go and traverse it. That'll be solved with a dungeon mode in which players have to visit parts of it, open gates with puzzles and challanges, and traverse the parts you don't have to see during the normal story, or even during map completion.
---
So FURNACE has been TAKEN?
---
It's still better than FF14s the random skating around desync thing when looking at other players is a meme.
---
"Hello, fellow Real Raiders of Tyria."
---
"DicUssIoN"
---
Any source for that? I would almost guess its the opposite but there Just isnt a single MMO that has a massive Playerbase Like for example wow:wotlk nowadays there are Just so many mmos with good player counts that it seems the Genre is dying.
---
The only depth it has is prayer flicking and that's maybe a shallow puddle at best
---
While it may look like gw2 PvE is all about doing things together - its actually not. Theres barely any hard fail state anymore, so most players just autoattack and rezz. For players that just want to get their loot with minimal effort - thats fine. For players that enjoy good gameplay, its not. Later one tend to be more prevalent on the subreddit. First ones are usually not active outside the game at all, or on the forum.
---
Hence this dichotomy of forum vs reddit.
---
Atm its especially heated because several long-time twitch streamers and hardcore/veteran guilds are preparing to leave for WoW Classic, or already have left for FFXIV / ESO, due to problems with anets (changed) development policies.
---
I never did the 8 orbs...I took about 50 goes to get it on vanilla necro....tried so many dif builds..in the end flesh wurm porting was the one that got me it. Back in the day, her title was like having Voice in the Void is now.
---
Yes, there is at least one clue:
---
If you actually log into the game and go do anything, there's a lot of people out there doing that thing.
---
Ah, yes, good old low effort post that stirres up drama, but mods can't do anything about it, because in that case you are right, and it's censorship so it's even more drama, *eksdeee*. 
---
**MUH FREE SPEEEECH** *in the distance*
---
Feels like this was targeted specifically at me...
---
Okay, I’ll agree, they need to communicate better. Even if they aren’t sure how or what, they gotta talk to us more like before.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
We always planned for more events. The 2v2/3v3's have been somewhat sidelined by a bug that is currently being squashed. We've also been wanting to swash a lot of the bugs we've had with queues and tournament. While the general ranked queue bugs have been reduced (not eliminated completely), we've seen an increase in tournament problems over the past few weeks. We're working to resolve those before we can run more tournament events.
---
Whatever the state of the game at the moment, "Guild Wars" is a recognized and valuable brand. It would be completely foolish for NCsoft to give up on it and close ArenaNet. Of course companies sometimes do make foolish decisions.

God dang it, you describe my situation so well. My friendlist used to be full of people every day, i could chat with, go do fractals and exploring. I used to have people that we raced together who will have the most AP, etc.  
---
Now my 200+ friendlist is empty unless there's a new patch where some people return for a day to be missed once again for months to see.
---
lmao
---
I used to care, but then HBO made it apparent it was more important to get to the end than tell the story well, sucking all the joy I had for the series out in an anticlimax of epic proportions.  Gotta get those spinoffs going!
---
4 years ago FFXI announced it was going into maintenance mode. They still haven't stopped releasing content for it.
---
If FFXI is profitable enough for SE to keep going with it, why would Anet kill GW2? It's literally their only source of income, and it's infinitely more profitable and popular than XI is.
---
So what, you think Anet is gonna put out one more season, and then just go out of business? Or do you think they can make a more profitable game in a year that's meant to replace GW2 despite NCsoft just killing any possibility of something like that happening?
---
Raids are endlessly replayable. That's been one of the core successes about them. People like to clear all the wings every week.
---
Hardcore players are drifting off for a few reasons. The game stopped being 'something for everyone' and started being something for casual long on for a two hours a week focused. 
---
I've been a low plat sPvP'er, have multiple clears on all the Raids, solo'd just about every solo'able boss and Dungeon in the game, lead Map Completion trains/HP trains/Temple Runs/ all the different METAs. I'd say I'm a hardcore casual so you know where I'm coming from. Here's why I don't play nearly as much as I did 6 months ago, a small fraction really.
---
Open World: Lack of challenging content in PvE. PoF was at least for me 1 and done, while HoT had challenging content and really the only reason I every enter the open world. One of my things is I like to Solo group content. PoF's HP bosses shouldn't even be called 'bosses', first time through I solo'd every one and I don't think a single one got more than a third of my HP. It took me around 80 tries to figure out how to solo the Mushroom Queen in TD. Bounties would have been great for that but the spawn mechanic is such it's almost impossible to get clean solo's and such a hassle to get multiple attempts. 
---
Rewards: Anything the least bit challenging and those that don't want the challenge or aren't willing to put in the time and effort complain they don't get the Legendary X or don't get to see the map for Y Raid. Godz forbid an achievement actually be an achievement. 
---
Instanced content: New Raids and fractals are sooo few and far between. Raids are great but one or two new ones per year just isn't going to keep serious Raiders attention. And, Serious Raiders are the ones who teach and help less serious players so fewer now have access to Raiding because 'hardcore' players aren't there.
---
WvW: Again, nothing new, same zergs bashing into the same zergs night after night, week after week. Thus many of the really good commanders and organized guilds go away and it become a spiral. 
---
sPvP: There just isn't a large enough player base to have three plat ranks. There is such a huge difference in skill level between plat one and plat three the games are a clown fest. Usually a Gold player in the mix and that player just gets farmed the whole game. Without a couple Gold player or two Queues are 20-30 mins. 
---
Back a couple years ago the game did a great job balancing the different player levels. The game with casual but there were things for hardcore players to do too. It is becoming less and less 'play the game the way you want' and more and more 'story'.  Theme-park I'm good with, if I want to play a game for the story it wouldn't be GW2 as it really isn't that good nor challenging.
---
Yes , people who joined the game late, and who didn't finish the actual expansions. And a few veterans, that is what I see. 
---
But as already said in Reddit, for gamers which didn't join the game late, there is no choice expect " come back later when there will be content "
---
I'm pretty sure most people have sub-1 FPS when that attack goes off, so it's not really anyone's fault for getting hit by it...
---
This sub does not accurately reflect the entire population of GW2.
---
I tend to run thumper turret bulwark gyro and shredder. Elite o go stealth in wvw or crate for world bosses. To harvest loot like the loot ponys on modnir I go flame thrower and flame turret.( Same running the Steve lab)
---
You say this as if "the fanboys" are all the same people  Big fallacy.  They're not necessarily the same, in fact, they're likely different people
---
Finally some content.
---
Where is the actual evidence? Stuff like revenue? I think in the last one it is less than the same quarter last year but more than the previous quarter. As for player number at least try to cite some numbers from companies that try to track these sort of things(if there is one). The various VOIP programs might be able to provide something useful if they track and share that.
---
It's a problem of their own making, alot of the big wvw updates were huge failures (eotm and desert border) because they werent listening to the audience and didnt know what made wvw maps work (i guess original devs moved on to better things)
---
I should've clarified that I meant management because I also heard alot of negative stuff about the management + the glassdoor reviews.
---
Ynow, the font different is pretty obvious.
---
Prob should stop this since tpot is legitimately afraid of getting into trouble with furnace taken memes...
---
Well, keep in mind that the team on the festivals is the "Side stories" team. And festivals is a one time investment that requires very little extra yearly work. 
---
Not everyone can do all of the recurring achievements in one year (specially SAB tribullation). For those who can't, next year they can keep at it, and for those who can, next year they just have to do annuals and dailies, and they get more free time for other stuff.
---
Once they have a full set of recurring festivals, hopefully that'll free the 'side stories' team to do other things. Like bringing back S1 and refurbishing old content. 
---
*Hopefully*.
---
6 RAID WINGS A YEAR
---
LAST CM FRACTAL OVER 2 YEARS AGO
---
It's because people actually have to put themselves out there to join a group, unlike in other games where you just hit "queue" for lower tier raids and you're good
---
if there is no content, you gotta produce some content yourself!
---
Its funny that this reddit was making so much fun of Bless Online and that its refugees were coming here (note: I never played Bless Online and have extensively played GW2) then the same thing somewhat happens with GW2 and you got excuses coming out of the woodwork.  Face it, ever since the layoffs, GW2 has not felt the same and the devs are still not communicating very well about the future of the game.  I've gone back to WoW myself, since a local friend persuaded me to and can't say I really feel like I am missing anything from GW2.  I wasn't around for the boss rush last week and it never really crossed my mind.  GW2 simply is not as fun as it used to be, and no I am not a hardcore raider.
---
That was oil in the fire which she threw after the shitshow with deroir took off. It all still happened outside the amas and the fact that she felt like speaking differently outside the AMA has nothing to do with whats happening inside the AMA.
---
Being professionaly friendly during work hours in one thing, being shitty to others and calling them random ass hats is a diff.
---
&gt;ANet stopped communicating with us after reddit went bonkers with the JP situation a year ago
---
Not really, ANet are infamous for not communicating releases and development for almost the entire lifespan of the game. (especially outside of PvE)
---
&gt; but the way Anet handle thing in term of communication and releasing of contents is very poorly done. 
---
pretty much always been that way with maybe a handful of exceptions
---
Yes! New content! A fractal I'll do 5 times a month when its part of my dailies. Just what I wanted!
---
I don't think you opened the video I hyperlinked there because there is a hell of a lot more going on than merely prayer flicking lol.
---
Have I missed something? Whats that about? I just saw a shitty pic with some pepes... whats going on here?
---
The font doesn't seems right..
---
&gt; GW2 could really use a 'refurbishing' team to rework old content that people usually just play once to make it more replayable.
---
but that is apparently not possible because all old content was created using duct tape and glue
---
having heard many horror stories about old codebases I can easily believe that one
---
Ouch
---
This is true, but that only makes the whole situation *more* baffling.  They backed out of a promised feature, because they couldn't solve a problem of *their own making*.  They were the ones who decided to implement these long precursor crafting quests in the first place!  They delivered HoT with long quests for all the Gen 1 legendaries, and 3 of the Gen 2 ones, yet at no point was anyone like, "Hey, this is a lot of work.  I'm not sure we'll be able to keep this up after launch."?

Thx for pointing it out without enlightening us...
---
I'm gonna be honest with you, I forgot that you could queue outside of heart of the mists. That really opens up my world

the "6969g 69s 69c", "my first legendary" etc don't get deleted either

CONTENT HYPE

I Love festivals, personally
---
Is it real? If yes, why does it have still branded theme?
---
I actually like the idea of a rotating crop of festivals from which to harvest. Like my ideal rotation would be something like.  Two week minor events (kill world bosses, ley events, maybe a dungeon rush event, or even "go murder the shit out of destroyers because screw those guys"). have those rotating in the background at all times. Then have major events like wintersday, halloween, sab (when they overlap have the minor events related to the main event.   
---
An example would be halloween could include minor two week long events that encourage exploring the surrounding zones and "supporting the festival.  
---
Also we need a major event for each race.  
---
the norn have dragon bash.  
---
the humans have wintersday,halloween(kind of) and festival of the four winds.  
---
the assura have SAB   
---
the char should have something (no clue to what).  
---
but my real point would be The sylvari need to get to celebrate arbor day as a major holiday for them.
---
This was really disappointing seeing as female humans get quite a cute pose on the chair.

Zzzzzzzzzz

Hi, as someone who works in tech (international company) this is a lot harder than it sounds. Yes, buisiness analysts and others involved in the research process understand the benefit of user testing, research, input, etc... but there's a lot more roles that do not. Customer communication costs money, and time. Higher ups do not like when things are going to take longer AND be more expensive, especially if they don't see the value. I guarantee you people want to communicate with customers, but it's far more complicated than you'd think. I used to think like this, "Just do xyz and then it'll be fine!! Your game will be great!!" and then I got a hard reality check after working in the industry.
---
I'm looking forward to it!
---
That's fucking epic.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c0kfdq/known_issue_tracker_abandoned/?st=jyggi8hx&amp;sh=77754feb) from last month says Known Issue Tracker has been dead since at least March 2019. A dev said they'll put a notice.
---
Guess which still haven't been fixed? Yes, it's the [Known Issue Tracker](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/231272908-Known-Issue-Tracker)!
---
The button I've been using to CS for 4 years is now moved, so I either move the keybind and lose F5s on all the other characters, or lose my sanity and try to relearn (well too bad that I ran out of buttons on my mouse already!), or use 3rd-party add-ons just to swap one keybind for one class. Yes, I'm still unhappy.
---
And all those "trade-offs"? Yeap, just removed all the fun little interactions. The class became dumber and more boring, that's just it.
---
ofc they gona censor everything they dont like,who even take reedit,twiter seriously? they will soon gona follow new youtube policy = REMOVE EVERYTHING WE DONT LIKE,EVEN IF ITS NOT AGAINS OUR RULES. im here just for shit and giggles.
---
Lol maybe one day but for now I shall enjoy the memes
---
These aren't "most dedicated players" these are just typical twitch chat audience tho.

Hello all! I'm still a fairly new player, and I keep finding myself super overwhelmed with all the content and things to do in GW2 (fractals, dungeons, raids, storyline, etc.). I really want to experience this content, but since I'm so overwhelmed, I've been sticking primarily to the storylines and exploring the core world, and I've had a really hard time finding a guild that will keep me since I'm so inactive during the school year. I'm wondering does anyone have something I could reference that has all the available content of GW2 listed in an organized fashion that also directs how new players should approach this content? Thanks much!
---
And you think all people listen to him? It's naive to think that. No matter if it's just to create a drama or if people think they would "protect" the streamer this way, if there is a chance for drama, there are always people who agitate it.
---
I don't blame the streamer for this, but his fans. This whole thing started when the streamer said he would leave GW2. You can't deny that.
---
Glad to see the 2 month timeframe that got official extended to a 3 month timeframe is now unofficially maybe a 4 month timeframe.
---
Yeah, but for me it's really the fine print that gets me. I'm all for massive overhauls if I get something interesting in return. Like you said, this is just obnoxious. I'd be happy to relearn chrono if it meant a CS every 40 seconds. CS is chrono's thing. I always found it odd that chrono's mechanic could only be used once every 100 seconds. 
---
With the massive tradeoff of losing illusionary personality (and it is perhaps the BIGGEST tradeoff they could have chosen) I think it would have been very fair to get the distort cooldown on CS.
---
But yeah, the button binding system is a joke. I didn't have a problem with it, idk why, I'm good at learning new buttons fast. But I can see why it's a massive annoyance for everyone else.
---
Other games have managed to monetize without having to rely on Subscription fees, and they are still fair (Warframe, PoE).
---
GW2 needs a new business model, yes, but I don't think it desperately needs a subscription fee.
---
At this Point i am so thirsty for s5 that I can‘t stop thinking about  the small possibilty of this besing real
---
I cant for the life of me dodge TT’s AoE and I’m not really that new. Playing with 2 fps doesnt help either
---
&gt; "I have to grind it now or I'll never get it!" like there is in MMOs.
---
I can personally say this is one of the primary reasons why I quit Blade &amp; Soul despite that it has and had far better gameplay than GW2 does. That and because of how retardedly greedy NCWest is obviously with the microtransactions.
---
Two more would be 98001.
---
Part of me really wants an explanation of this ‘meme’, but the other part of me saw that Pepe Frenz style post, and thinks I’m much better off not knowing.
---
...thus air quotes.
---
Most mmos dont Release their Player counts so (i hate to repeat myself) source? And Like i Said nowadays there are so many mmos that have a rather huge Player Base (nothing compared to old wow) Just Look in the asian Market or the many mobile mmos.
---
Sounds like you're bad and thats the real sad thing here. Have you tried a good ol' cup of get gud and it hasnt even been 15 years since it was out.
---
I have helped mess up meta events before because I was so focused on what I was doing that the chat just vanishes. Usually happens when im learning a new rotation
---
For me it's the removal of all the awesome little combos you used to be able to do.
---
Trple casting utilities, using cs to extend portals without having to run between them, a mirror blade+blink inside cs, using shield 5 and comboing it with a sword 3 swap and not having the skill go on cooldown because of RNG, doubling up any skill at any time in a sticky situation such as grav/heal well, heal signet aftercast, the old Signet of Inspiration being able to *give* boons to players, distortion share, old Signet of Illusions, fractal precast, being able to F3 in the middle of WvW when a thief or mirage jumps you before you can target them to get clones up... I could go on for hours. 
---
I couldn't really care less about it's DPS or what rotation/gear is needed to give boons in raids. I care more about the fun of chrono in pvp/wvw roaming. They removed most of the complex and fun utility/tricks from it. The parts which gave chrono a high skill ceiling are all gone.
---
You may want to take a step back there, re-read your sentence, and consider how it may also apply to you.
---
Says who?
---
I would be happy if my Blurred Frenzy had the same duration as the one from Xera.
---
You’re doing god’s work. May your dodges always land successfully

I subbed to ff14

Has the white thing on top but you can crop it easily if you dont want it
---
It's almost as if those chairs are the bottom scrape of the monetization barrel quickly shat out for profit without even an attempt to deliver a good product.
---
And dont forget MMO is a real broad term (compared to MMORPG) destiny for example is an mmo
---
TBH some of those posts are echo chambers in and of themselves, just with 2 separate camps circlejerking themselves for/against the other.  Real discussions aren't happening (at least when I ran across them) in newer threads, just rehashing of comments.
---
For example, I'm pretty sure I've seen this comment `Criticizing isn't drama/bad/negative` and permutations thereon at least 8 times today.  It's true, critique isn't inherently bad, but it must be constructive for it to be _good_.  And not all of it (read, probably a minority - still, the comments people read first) is constructive and is oversimplifying the issues in a way that only conveys the sentiment without the value.
---
WP is doing a series where he critiques other people’s PvP games.  Pretty good for learning conquest

Gearing nine characters is my end game.
