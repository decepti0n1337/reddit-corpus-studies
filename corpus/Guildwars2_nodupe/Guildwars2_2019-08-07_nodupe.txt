stealth is only deactivated after 2 minutes and so is healing, so you have 2 minuts two fight "normal" which is kinda like a battle royal mode.  Lets see if they also deactivate shields then, otherwise shield supporters could get a huge advantage after two minutes against heal supports

PvP games are fun when there's a leaderboard or competitive scene. If I have to grab friends and tell them to connect to a custom server map to do some scrims that takes a lot of the competition out. It's the same as trying to compete on 2v2 fights in WvW or duel server fights, it cannot feel the same as an actual ranked queue with matchmaking.
---
Farming:
---

---
1 spvp match for daily rewards.
---
1 Set of festival dailies
---
For progression:
---
Map completion (as you mentioned)
---
Advance a collection for a skin (you can keep the ones you want on a watch list, and pull up a YouTube guide).
---
Unfortunately you don’t have time to reliably join a fractal group.
---
Sry vigil keep (was) best hub hands down.
---
They're worse than last time; don't worry about it!

---
It still makes an entire profession too much of a risk to bring into combat. A fight can last longer than 2 minutes due to the amount of sustain and mitigation most professions pack.
---
Remember Thieves have a hard time killing anything these days. And Raid DPS means jack shit in PvP, as much as everyone points it out.
---
It'd be different if Thieves were actually on a level playing field in terms of power. But they aren't what they used to be, and ANET has made sure they hammered home 5 years worth of sheer salt and frustration to its mains. So much so that a single patch that actually helped us isn't changing our attitudes about them and their shit.
---
Perma stealth thief or something bulshit like water/earth minstrels Weaver would never die if you looped the defensive rotation
---
What do you mean by ‘find and unlock the trait lines’. As you collect hero point and level up, there’s only 1 trait line to unlock the base class, no choices. Really you should be training the base class as you collect HP, then experimenting with your build.
---
They never worked on the problems of conquest and the complains of players. My main one is that the map is too large for just 5 players. You want to def, attack, gather and defend resources, use the catapults, get heroes etc. I feel like a lot of the times it is better to avoid a fight until a lord can be attacked.
---
Only you know what mastery points you have left. Do them!
---
Can we pick add-ons later on? I got my early bird book through my phone and didn't get to see those while checking out :/
---
Are you sure you have all the ones available over land?
---
Did you find all the Strongboxes?
---
Have you done the adventures?  Some adventures are going to be too much of a pain, but others like Salvage Pit, Tendril Torchers and Drone Race shouldn't be too much of a bother to get silver and/or gold on.
---
Do you have Living Story Season Three?  Those maps have more mastery points too.
---
Mastery points are tied to several event chains, as seen in the achievement list.  Have you done all the events in the Verdant Brink daytime chains?  Have you beaten all the Verdant Brink night-time bosses?

They want daredevil to be a bruiser, but it has not enough sustain to survive in fights. Special swipe skills could be added to try to achieve that.
---
you can hop in and do t4 dails without cm's in 20 mins without trouble. just needs some prep beforehand like having a static at those free time spots where all are just ready to go.  
---
did that for a few months 1 year ago or so, works like a charm.
---
Im not saying you are dumb or anything. I gave you advice what i think can help you to learn it. I didnt imply you are dumb. All i meant was it really is just practice, nothing else.
---
Sorry if it sounded offending
---
I'm afraid that this is probably the closest thing to the truth in this situation. :(
---
Yes sadly they wanted to do that, but they dont get that this doesnt work. Making the daredevil a viable pointholder would be an even worse idea than the tradeoff as it is now, because as soon as the thief is a equally strong pointholder as other classes are, it would get completely overpowered because of its mobility of it´s weaponsets and the newly added portal. To make the daredevil into a balanced pointholder you would have to rework the entire class with some of the core utilities and weaponsets.
---
The 4790k is still completely able to supply the 5700 with calls. With overclocking, cpu-z puts my processor above a 7700.
---
What lvl are you and what content is maming troubles?
---
2v2 ranked where you could duoqueue would be a fucking dream, I’m so sick of matching with people who can’t even cooperate and operate as a coordinated team.
---
Thats because their philosophy for each class isn't coherent with the current balance of the game.
---
Yes, elite specs should have a trade off over core, but sadly in reality Core Thief is the strongest thief already so nerfing Daredevil in lieu of conceptual design reflects horrible in actual gameplay.
---
The obvious way to find out is to just try it. You weren't able to in the last 2 days?
---
(it doesn't)
---
That's usually an option with these sorts of things, yes. Especially since they're adding more add-ons as stretch goals.
---
I'm not really sure what you're saying, were you looking for a cryptocurrency option?
---
You may have to buy some Living World seasons also. If you played when they came out, you got them for free. You can also wait for a sale for any you are missing.
---
TBH Daredevil is more Monk than Ninja.  It doesn't hide in shadows... not a single trait or new skill in its kit compliments stealth at all.  It's meant to be seen, stand in your face, and hit you with a stick or its fists... or MAYBE throw daggers.
---
Shame. Do you remember the core third dodge stuff you mentioned? I'm curious about it now
---
Yea it's definitely more fun at 80 where it's not as much "carry". In this game, GW2 isn't supposed to be a game that you go wander around and kill things for exp. Dungeons will reward far more experience. The game is not meant to be an exp grind from monsters like conventional MMOs. Infact you can level up to 80 simply by walking around discovering areas without killing a single thing. It's so fast to level, you can level to 80 in two days easily if you know what you're doing.
---
I do suggest doing dungeons and all associated paths. E.G Ascalonian Catacombs has four "separate" dungeon paths. Each story level is only around 10 levels apart and 5 levels after that you'll get an explorable version with 3 separate paths/options for the dungeon which will give you around a level for each the first time through. I would also then start crafting, if you are in a guild get the guild crafting boosts (Ask your guild how) and go start crafting for your profession, this will give you another few levels. After you do these dungeons I suggest mixing it up, find some world bosses in your low level area and do those. Find a few jumping puzzles, it's good to get started on that skill which can be useful later on. There are also quite a few mini open world dungeons around the place that you can search up for your area. I would also be working on acquiring as many hero points as you can in the map as you'll want access to your skills sooner which will help with levelling.
---
At level 60ish you should really be looking at starting to daily complete Tequatl (A world boss) and your other dailies just because it gives you a decent amount of gold which is neat for that level. Of course, you'll want to do other bosses such as the Shatterer. Finish your story and keep going with the appropriate level dungeons. 
---
You could try craft with other professions e.g if you play a warrior, you would probably craft both Armorsmithing and Weaponsmithing. You could then also craft Jeweller and Chef in total that will give you around 32 levels in crafting alone... I do suggest chef and Jeweller first as they're easier on your wallet.
---
At 70-80 you should really be doing some of the higher level dungeons that will help you gear early on. At levels 76-80 you should be at silverwastes if you want to level fast, just tag every event. At level 80 I'd be exploring Dry Top and the Silverwastes. At this point, completing your story, working towards maxed gear would be the next thing.  After that I'd also then try get into fractals through Lions Arch where you require basically maxed gear to reach the highest levels. Whilst you do that, you can try some WvW out and see how you like that (Probably not much at first because you generally want a different armor set to PvE for that and will keep dying from inexperience). From then on it's up to you really, you can go try craft a legendary, you could farm some gold in Silverwastes.
---
Or you could buy the expansions and continue the story onwards. You'll either then want to buy some of the living stories or farm gold for it, up to you. Complete them all and then get into raiding as well, do the meta events in the new maps and complete bounties and unlock all your mounts and masteries.
---
You can have a lot of different builds and they should all do fine in open world. I play core Necro and right now a minion master type build, where I have numerous minions out all the time. They help with CC, so you need fewer skills like take root and do damage, as well.
---
What traits and weapons are you using? Also: use shroud whenever you can. When I started I often ignored this option but it really helps.
---
True. Pvp hasn’t changed a bit. It’s nice to see the PvE crowed down vote actual PvPers who want content and not just more empty maps that go unused by the bulk of PvP. 
---
PvP isn’t about rewards, it’s about fun or of competition and for whatever reason Anet has forgotten that. Then need to add new mode that are fun to play. Conquest is boring as hell at this point. 
---
Honestly, has any MMO with PvP ever left there PvP scene so stagnant like this? Ever?!
---
As someone who has done DPS golem to compare Marauder to Zerker... it's a hell of a lot more than 7% damage lost.  Closer to 25% damage on most classes and as much as 33% on some...  a Zerk Dragon hunter can kill all non-vet mobs in half a second, AoE even before they have a chance to hit.  Marauder can not.  Not taking a hit at all is always better than taking an extra hit.
---
They do have pins, (also a pin collector) they are a little expensive. But maybe not as two are stained glass pins? not sure what that means but it sounds nice.
---
Right but all he'd lose would be his account/progress. Nothing could stop him from continuing to data mine (aside from them obfuscating the dat or putting less stuff in early)
---
what things are a must buy in the real money shop?
---
Awesome group of people, wish I had the money to invest in it, always comes at a bad time for me.
---
You're not wrong.
---
What class do you like having the most in a group?
---
I don't know why you are talking about the % of damage increase with exotics vs ascended when you are using a build that picks absolutely nothing damage-oriented at all with the build you linked?
---
Like in all honesty guardian doesn't have a whole lot of poor weapon choices to pick from but you picked the worst possible. Shield requires you to stop attacking altogether and I can't think of anything in open world PvE that you would be in desperate need of 3 seconds of projectile blocks that you couldn't handle perfectly fine with either focus 5 or using your F3 if you really managed to find something causing you that much trouble. Longbow deals extremely low damage, and you are missing out on greatsword for the very high burst and great cleave and additional mobility in order to have something that is basically worthless outside of tagging mobs from a distance.
---
Even with the dragonhunter traitline... the most important trait in the whole traitline is Big Game Hunter, and zeal + radiance are integral traitlines to guardian dealing any amount of damage that isn't bottom of the barrel. You have none of these at all.
---
I'm sorry dude but this is quite literally one of the worst builds I have ever seen posted for guardian in PvE ever. I know you mean well and intend to help but my god.
---
Yes, definitely the best gem store purchase of them all.
---
The actual value you gain from salvaging stuff is not the main deal. You do not put down 200 gold upfront or a few bucks just to trickle  it back a few copper at a time. If you want to make gold, just unload your inventory  during special events. 
---
The main thing is the inventory space saved and the increased efficiency of which you can do things. A few minutes wasted here and there clicking doesn't seem like much but your wrists and also whoever in your party that's waiting for you does care. It's likely that they'll also be more tolerant of any mishaps should you treat them like their time matters.  Storage space is also really expensive if you think about it.
---
Plus it talks. YMMV.
---
Yeah there's definitely options for Firebrand, but I **really** value the extra health from Mender's. 
---
Firebrand already has very low health and low mobility, that I find stacking defensive stats to be very beneficial.
---
On things like Tempest, I actually use Harrier's since I have things like Lightning Flash and Eye of the Storm to help me escape.
---
What did I just watch?
---
Daredevil is absolutely a ninja. Its headpiece is literally a ninja mask.  It can literally Naruto Run with its dash dodge.
---
Hi, I actually use a controller to play this game daily! While you will still need your mouse for some things like right clicking (perhaps I can change this for you), a good chunk of the game can be played solely with a controller. I use Controller Companion on steam, but prior to it I used XPadder which works just as well. If you can hook up a controller to your computer and get a controller program downloaded, I can help walk you through the setup I use for pretty much everything! With modifications for any extra needs you may need since you can't use much of your right hand.
---
thank you very much for your comment akatosh. it is very hard as you say and experience playing these types of games with  physical issues.  i have however tried to use bind keys so it is easier  and it has not worked out. The camera is a  big issue though and having it follow my character would help very much even if it changes my skill in game. 
---
thank you for commenting about your experience,   i will  now try to change the camera to follow me
---
&gt; Give us 2v2 queues for the love of god
---
&gt; it’s not hard just add a 2v2 queue you’ve done it before
---
but also
---
&gt; EDIT: I really hope I’m wrong that they aren’t adding 2v2 queue’s, because this is just a waste of the art teams time and resources.
---
:upsidedownface:
---
I would be interested in a living card game but not a trading card game. I'm quite done with games of all sorts pushing some form of gambling as "fun".
---
i just want more variety in general.  GW1 had some cool ideas.  like why don't we have capture the flag?
---
But it doesn’t matter, raids aren’t hard enough to need more healing power. Having stat trade offs is even a good thing; you choose between more healing and more difficult boon uptime or easy boons and lower healing.
---
I enjoyed your artwork.
---
I can't believe no one else said Hidden Minstrel yet. It's so stupid, I love it.
---
w/e man the white knight tards are gonna downvote the hell out of everything that isn't kissing anets arse anyways.
---
Haha all good. Percussion is mine as well.
---
Something really cute :3 !
---
ive made some songs by opening the music editor and slow it down a bit and generate the ahk for some songs it works well
---
Sword Focus Weaver with full Minstrels.
---
They exist purely to annoy the living shyt out of people and basically contest CPs.
---
They can't do any meaningful damage to kill anyone either, so all they do is spin spin spin spin and spin some more while their allies come to gank.
---
And if yu try to catch them, they just Lightning Flash and Mistform and pat their behinds as they leave.
---
First of all, I have 36 spare HoT points without really looking for them after I unlocked all masteries.
---
You need to find strongboxes and check all Dragon Stand achievements. Many of them will award you with super easy mastery just by participating in events.
---
Check outposts event chains achievements. 
---
I always stayed away from adventures so don't even have silver on them but doing gold award you two.
---
Hope this helps.

Have you looked into a gamepad such as [the Razer Tartarus?](https://www.amazon.ca/Razer-Tartarus-Progammable-Detachable-Mecha-Membrane/dp/B07754PYFK)
---
While I don't have mobility issues, I do have smaller hands and cannot use a keyboard for extended periods of time without pain so have been using a Belkin n52TE (the grandfather of the Tartarus) and it is amazing. I have tried to use a keyboard in some games, and that just feels strange and ends up hurting after a bit. The keys are fully customizable, there's more of them with ease-of-access, and it's ergonomic. Between it and using the Logitech G600 (MMO mouse) I have not had to use a keyboard in about a decade unless I chose to for gaming.
---
I play GW2 completely with the n52TE and G600, including T4 fractals and raids, and have done so since beta with zero issues. I also use these to play games ranging from MMO's to FPS to sims to RPG's because you can easily customize what keys do what and switch things around to whatever is comfortable and makes sense to you. You can even set up a profile/keybinds for any program you use often so instead of hitting a shortcut on your computer or clicking, you just hit a single button on the pad.
---
I can't speak to how the Tartarus is to set up, but I don't think it's really any different than the n52TE. You install the software, plug it in, and you're good. You use the software to set up the keybinds and profiles, and once you set them up you just change between them as needed. Some models even come with on-board memory so you can take it and use it on someone else's computer and it will use the last used profile you had it on without the need of installing software on their computer.
---
Obviously what works for one person won't work for everyone, but a gamepad changed my (gaming) life and is probably the main reason I haven't developed wrist issues in my left hand.
---
Dude unblockable consume plasma op, as well as stealth ability you get when you use steal on a thief, or better yet, unblockable throw gunk
---
Use basi venom and its already unblockable. With daredevil you have enough evades to make up for dagger storm.
---
Unblockable Healing Seed feels good man
---
Aaaaaaand, its sold out.
---
This was one of the best things I've seen today. 
---
\*Parties in Boy\*
---
Some art commissions, the early bird discount, and signed books are sold out. Regular of most of everything is still in stock.
---
Great, I want these (despite the artifacts) but I'll be without my computer until the 23rd due to moving complications... probably going to leave shop well before then and not come back until Wintersday :/
---
I really would love to buy some GW2 art books. 
---
Just came back after a 2year hiatus of Gw2. Been able to get my first 2 legendaries and working on a third. 
---
Super love the story
---
He wasn't serious, he just wanted to be edgy.
---
Peanut butter and chicken broth?
---
bah. pvp is dead. we''ll do it again for a while if the new weapons are nice and looks good.   
---
but let's be serious: for most of pvpers winning or losing is pointless. you just do for the season reward and that's all . once you completed all the chest u stop till next season.   
---
u can downvote me but this is what most do. 2 vs2 can make it faster
---
it's called wvw here
---
Unfortunately he's not, he's just a white knight
---
This would have been such a cool feature (ala Witcher 3), shame it never developed.
---
wvw is the closest thing to that yes. i pretty much only play this game for the wvw...
---
I had a bunch that just didn't register, that would say like "kill this do to take x" but found out that it's not really enough to just kill, you have to be a part of the whole event. That seemed to sort most out.
---
But I'm done now and hope is sick!
---
Fun is subjective so I don't argue with your view on that. Tho to me, getting stomped (or stomping) by organised duo or FB+Scourge for 100 times don't seem so fun. 
---
It would have short games tho and maybe short queues due that. Well until 90% of less than HC pvp players stop playin because they got bursted in 0.5s from stealth and it's game over
---
This thing is perfect for Necro. Except for the fact that focus on necro is smelly garbage.
---
My solution to the whole unbalanced thing,  is that im just gonna kill the enemy team and win. 👌
---
My wife plays almost exclusively using an Xbox controller.  We use [Pinnacle Game Profiler](http://pinnaclegameprofiler.com/) because it is highly customizable and works with all software, but Steam is almost as good these days.
---
Here is [our layout](https://imgur.com/a/zAmIE), but you'll probably want to use something different.
---
If you haven't looked into it already, voice control software like [VoiceBot](https://www.voicebot.net/) can also be really handy for triggering less urgent commands like "Inventory", "Map", or "Skimmer".
---
Good luck, I hope you find an enjoyable control configuration!
---
I want to thank everyone so much for having me check the cpu temperature. I just installed a new cooling fan for the cpu and I’m at 70-80 FPS😭. THANK YOU GUYS SO MUCH YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW THANKFUL I AM
---
Oh nice! We're all sharing your happiness, have fun! :)
---
UPDATE: The problem was my cpu was getting too hot! I just installed a new cooling fan as well as an additional fan and I’m at 70-80 fps now 😭😭. My computer is so much faster and I am so thankful for all of you on this subreddit. 
---
You guys are great and I appreciate it so much. I’ll see you all in game!
---
Hit me up
---
Oh, good to know, thx. :)
---
I do play a bruiser daredevil and it works pretty fine actually. If it comes down to the "not enough sustain" part. I've had more often than not the "most healing done" in games with no supporter in the team. And it's still a very dodge heavy daredevil, thus my "dps mitigated, by evade" would be even higher. Much higher.
---
Sure. Back when the Daredevil rotation involved interrupting the second and third auto with boundz so that the third part of the auto chain was buffed from the Bound modifier, I put Nevermore as the skin for my staff and watched for the blue trail from the second part of the chain which was a sideways swipe.
---
Watching for the sideways blue trail was much easier for learning timings and the more obvious animation meant I wasn't watching icons and could pay more attentions to my surroundings.
---
Wait for one to advertise in lions arch
---
Yea, that's what happened to me.
---
I've checked the bank right now and it took that money again, so everything is fine (I hope).
---
First time something like that happened to me after 7 years of playing, so I was a bit scared :P
---
Anything with Gourdon is great. Also: great artstyle. Love this gritty brush for color and lineart.
---
hey, keep selling those unids. I want free money
---
I specifically removed that as kodan aren’t actually that high in mountains, they are in cold areas due to arctic but the waters are often at sea level. And help differentiate Goliath Norn and kodan.
---
Structured just means it's heart of the mists and not WvW
---
I'm still holding out for that 10v10 / larger scale map and hopefully more queuing options, including 2v2, with that. The August 30th announcement would be a good time to update on that. 
---
Conquest feels stale as the only really supported game mode (which is a shame, Stronghold is occasionally fun) and a larger scale mode where it is slightly more chaotic and difficult to micromanage would be a lot of fun.
---
My nostalgia for maps like WSG and AB in early WoW is growing.
---
I think a lot of people are missing your point which is about prioritization of the skills and not why you should interrupt AA or not. The main reason to perform AA chains during a rotation in the first place is (generally) when you have downtime meaning all your high damage skill are on CD.
---
Not interrupting AA chains means don't cancel your third auto when you spent already time to get there. If you are too slow to push the buttons and an auto-attack starts in between "big" skills which are part of the rotation, feel free to interrupt them. If you have nothing to cast and do 2 auto-attacks before a main skill become available, wait to perform the 3rd attack before continuing the rotation.
---
That said based on your current situation, I would suggest to try not overthinking these details now. Focus to learn the rotation and get it in your fingers without worrying about stuff like AA chains (exception might scourge and power DD builds), stowing skills or aftercast. Just get used to your class animations/AA icons, if you try to focus on everything it will actually be harder to learn.
---
Good luck on your path towards T4/raids!
---
Guild Finisher.
---
You are good enough you make me want to recruit you.
---
Either that or SCREW YOU MY GUILD IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN YOURS.
---
EH
---
a.k.a. "Waste the account bound, time limited currency on crafting materials, which you could easily farm by running around in PVE."
---
I don't actually see the problem with d/p being core build, though. Yes, daredevil not having more buildcraft is issue, not not because of lost steal. 
---
Anyways, they are reworking classes over time, and hopefully daredevil will get some love as well - to enhance on what daredevil is strong at, not based on what core thief is about.
---
This. I agree 100%.
---
5v5 doesn't feel satisfying. 2v2 does.
---
No NA. I usually get on about 11pm when I get home from work :)
---
Yeah no. T3 and 4 crafting materials are a royal pain to farm in any way conceivable. Laurels is the best way to get them with the least amount of effort.
---
s/w tempest is best for blasting might. My in progress FA Weaver rotations blasts fire with Earth 2 every rotation.
---
Sold cosmetic, come on.
---
What kind of money would that bring them, exactly ? None.
---
You are playing Guild Wars 2, not Guild Wars.
---
I like your idea of more diversity and more fitting stolen abillities for thief / daredevil a lot!
---
Remember, down state lava font is just part of your DPS.
---
Big Ele pro tip is just to get familiar with the skills, what they do and when it's best to use them, having 4 elements means 20 skills at your disposal, being a Weaver adds more.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm mostly a staff Ele btw, I use S/D Weaver when I feel like tryharding.
---
Just doing 1-spamming enemies is good for big events like bosses feels good lol, but soloing is a different gameplay
---
Use skills to create distance, e.g. Fire 4, Lightning 3, Earth 4 etc etc
---
I keep forgetting Water but it has good  support skills for extended battles.
---
Have 700+ Laurels on my main with no use for them. What do you suggest spending them on?
---
There are raids, they're 10 man encounters, mostly bosses with a bit of trash clearing and puzzles in between. The crafting system does let you make things that you can't buy anywhere, but those don't really require any special "hardcore" crafting - getting to the max crafting level is pretty easy, and crafting stuff from there is mostly about time and resource investment.
---
how can you not deal much dps as a power herald? You basically got 4 skills on S/S, each deal 12k to 15k DPS and auto attack dps is &gt;5k. Just using the active of glinth facettes or impossible odds in shiro would add even more additional DPS to this. wtf.
---
You all got it wrong on the low savings.  It's honestly due to the US tariffs wars and it's impacting their virtual currency.  Anet will confirm it!
---
I'm actively only playing with a steam controller for a few years now. Highly recommended.
---
10 man encounters? You mean 10 people go in at once? If you get high in crafting can you make things better for end game content that you couldn't do otherwise?
---
There are raids, but you need Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire to play ALL of them, some are included in Heart of Thorns and some in Path of Fire
---
There are many thinks you can only get by crafting for example Legendary Armor and Legendary Weapons from Generation 2 can only be crafted, Generation 1 Weapons can also be bought
---
Yes, a party of 10 people goes into a raid. You can have less people, but not more, and the encounters are balanced around there being 10. Really good players have cleared most of the raids with under 5 people, and some encounters are even soloable with the right build and a lot of patience. The best endgame gear is crafted or acquired from quests, but the difference between that and the thing you can buy is about 5-10%, so there's no ultra hardcore endgame gear for ultra hardcore endgame crafters.
---
&gt; Players [voted](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/name-the-new-competitive-weapon-set/) on the final name for this new competitive weapon set....
---
If Anet would have let the community choose a name instead choose an option, these weapons could have been named "\[weapon\]y Mc\[Weapon\] face" (examples: "Daggery McDagger Face"; "Swordy McSword Face", ect.)
---
Damn you Anet for not letting us! xD
---
Well this game has really sold me. It was either this or eso and I hated that crafting system. At least this one has purpose. Can you be a tank in this game and keep enemy attention on the tank?
---
But you would be ineffective. Warrior is not suited to be a tank in raids.
---
Why not.
---
&gt;AMD’s drivers over the last couple of years have been on point, especially when compared to NVidia drivers. 
---
No, just no. Having moved from a GTX960 to a RX580, I wouldn't even know where to start regarding all kind of weird issues. That being said, performance is not one of them, at least not for my card (maybe the latest generations have other issues), I get acceptable fps in GW2 even without d912pxy.
---
That would be likely..I say likely because it depends on build types in combination with weapon/utility choices as well.  Check out the site below for class guides, recommended gear, rotations, and descriptions.

May I ask why you decided to take the harp out?
---
I always found Crystal Oasis calming and it's one of my favourite pieces of music ever, but your rendition puts me on edge, like my body is anticipating something more to happen.
---
It makes me feel like you're leaving a village to run an errand which seems too simple, that there must be some sort of trap, as opposed to the original which feels mysterious due to the sharp notes and you want to remain cautious even if nothing is to happen because you're in a beautiful but unfamiliar place.
---
It's good in its own way, but it doesn't sound or feel like crystal oasis to me.
---
Yes it will. It does not mean every class is an effective tank.
---
My idea would be to pick the class that will give me access to the most health and armour I can possibly have.
---
forget "classic" tanking.
---
tanks in gw2 are not meat shields. they are also burdend with other important tasks. (boon sharing,...).
---
there is also very little "facetanking" happening. you negate getting dmg by using, block skills, evades or dodges.
---
if you are exp enough you would try to have the least possible amount of thoughness as example.
---
In general, yes.
---
Some bosses are exceptions.
---
But there is no tank class in gw2, a support class just tanks usually while giving boons.
---
Warr never tanks, warr is there for dps and offensive boons.
---
I have nothing against the harp in the original, in fact it's one of my favourite instruments. I simply wanted to make my own version and not just a copy of the original so I basically just transcribed the chord progression and melody and then did my own thing with it.
---
Boon sharing? Still the idea is for my char to stay alive. I dont think I can negative every attack.
---
defensive stats in gw2 are realy undertuned, forget everything you know about "calssic" tanking. see my reply above
---
&gt; people just want to see some changes that large portions of their respective wvw, pvp and endgame pve communities have been asking for for years.
---
And unless these changes are implemented, they are constantly talking about not wanting to play the game anymore.
---
&gt; so still no proof other than "yes, the mods said it happened so it happened" gotcha.
---
It's clear you haven't watched the streamer, as you've admitted yourself.
---
&gt; the lies in that comment were debunked in the replies to it lol, next.
---
No, and the comment links to one portion of the video where they admit they are brigading Reddit. It's far from the only instance, however.
---
&gt; if people are made aware of something they were previously unaware of and decide to offer their own opinion of their own volition, that is not brigading
---
Sorry, bud, but streamers who get a fanbase should take responsibility for that fanbase's actions when they encourage and promote them. This is not simply *"informing"* them. Most of his fans don't have any problem recognizing the he is toxic anyway - that's why they watch him.
---
&gt; which is still not what happened
---
It sort of is what happened. The twitch community is brigading on Reddit, fueled by as a fanbase to their streamer.
---
&gt; im speaking out of experience
---
You have shown little experience regarding the streamer's own stream content, even denying he does what he does, so I have to wonder how little is required to make something referable to as an "experience".
---
&gt; it's absolutely not toxic to call an echo chamber an echo chamber
---
It's absolutely not toxic to call a moron a moron. Oh, look, a tautological proof, now I can go and call anyone a moron.
---
Yeah, no. Perhaps you should consider that you are so obsessed with criticism Guild Wars 2 that you are unable to discern between positive content for it that isn't always bringing it down and consider it all the same, hence "an echo chamber".
---
&gt; if you just want news or constant positivity (because anything remotely approaching any kind of productive discussion gets deleted) 
---
Yeah, that's a bullshit statement. I can go over there and I could quote several threads that are basically just dedicated to criticizing Guild Wars 2. Maybe the fact that disrespectful posts and comments are curated away is throwing you off.
---
&gt; constantly calling things toxic because you don't agree with them is a large part of the problem this sub is facing these days and is essentially toxic itself.
---
I'm not going to be make it clear what has been made clear to you multiple times regarding what people are referring to as toxic. Read back to previous comments. The streamers' own following have no problem realizing how he is toxic. It's funny that the guy crying about strawman continues to strawman like this.
---
Different
---
You are part of the problem. You expect that "2v2 will be fb+scourge" only when its actually not true. 2v2 is way more balanced than 5v5 and the last 2v2 AT proved that.
---
tip for the future: right-click on absolutely everything in your inventory first before you do something with it, to see all the options you have for it. ;)
---
Shouldn't it be Devona for heavy?
---
Yes but I'm talking about filling material storage here.  Default is 250, if you don't already have 250 Winterberries, etc, you aren't taking up "inventory space" by filling them.  Additionally, unless something has changed, the accessories you buy with Laurels are only available with Core stats.  If you want ascended trinkets with Viper, Minstrels, Marauder, Trailblazer, etc, it's way cheaper getting stat selectable accessories from LW S3 vendors.
---
&gt; "spaghetti code"
---
Spaghetti code is very much a thing and still shows up even now.  However, that is usually a result of poor - no documentation, and a lack of any sort of planning between different groups coding.  At any rate, it shouldn't be as a result of the UI.  The UI could be perfect with a spaghetti code back end or the back end could be a wreck with an otherwise workable UI.  
---
I am not familiar with what exactly you are talking about here, but that is what I would take away from *spaghetti code* as a sys admin / programmer.
---
What's wrong with being bad?  
---
He is asking for tips on how to improve, which means he's already aware that he is a noob. Which is ok.
---
What made u think sub fee is a bad thing?
---
" But you would be ineffective "
---
Chrono Tanks are most common nowadays. The Calculation is quite simple:
---
As a tank you have very low damage numbers
---
A Chrono Tank can still offer Quickness (attackspeed) and Alacrity (lower CDs on spells) -&gt; the two most important Damage-buffs (besides might) ingame. 
---
In the end the chrono negates the "low-damage" profil through buffs, CC (moa) and utility (focus pull)
---
Besides nobody will choose a warrior as a tank....
---
You're so selfish lmao.
---
&gt; Yes, daredevil not having more buildcraft is issue, but not because of lost steal.
---
It seems my example didn’t quite come fully across. Daredevil d/p was weak in the past and by inputting swipe, most of those players have stopped playing d/p. 
---
When playing d/p, basi venom is used more often than dagger storm. It already gives an unblockable steal, and since you are daredevil, you have enough dodges to replace dagger storm. Not only that, basi has great synergy with backstab. By cutting the range significantly, you’re reducing gank potential, properly executing a low health target, what have you; all for something we already had. 
---
The issue with d/p core is that you dont have that extra dodge, (as well as bound and dash are very useful) you are even more vulnerable to condi (daredevil has good soft condi removal upon evade, and soft cc removal with dash)
---
Core d/p gives even less “evade sustain” it brings nearly the same things that core s/d brings, but less.
---
Man, I LOVE it.
---
Cute, but eventually you'll be bitching with us. At least you're having fun while it lasts for you.
---
Make this motherfucker a launch.
---
Takes a few minutes to do a full Winterberry run that nets you around 50 of them. In 20 minutes he could get around 200 if he has multiple level 80 characters. So you could, if are fast enough, get one Ascended Backpack, one Accessory and one Ring in maybe around 4h, taking into account that you also need Unbound Magic.
---
On the other hand, you need 75 Laurels (49 days of log-in rewards) for just one Ring and one Accessory.
---
Using Laurels on trinkets is slow and a waste, there are more efficient ways to do it.
---
Shhhhhh
---
A = normal player. 
---
B = dueling faction group.   
---
  X = faction.  
---
  Y = faction.    
---
C = enemy.   
---
D = neutral.    
---
  
---
Ignoring critters for now.    
---
Only accounting for two factions, guild halls exist for organized groups.   
---
A behaves as usual.  
---
A can not affect B.  (boons, conditions, targeting)  
---
 
---
X and Y are excluded from outside forces by their parent group.(C can still damage them for obvious cheesing reasons) 
---
X and Y are hostile towards each other.   
---
When killed by the other faction, they are allowed to respawn on the spot and a 10 second safety period begins.   
---
   
---
I can't see why it's not possible from a technical point of view.

---
Wow more gemstore exclusives, who would have thought..
---
&gt; With the shorter range you now need to stick more to the target you want to "unblockable steal",
---
D/p’s play style revolved around utilizing stealth and using the range from steal and shadowshot to backstab your opponent from afar. Significantly reducing the potential risks many classes bring; such as warriors amount of cc, even more efficient kiting against necro, heck, even hitting a holo outside of it’s cc range. 
---
Shadowshot and pistol 5 put blindness on the target, making you less reliant on just dodges and, like i said allows basi venom. Unblockable steal that used to have 1200 range.
---
Aka troll builds, they just kite you and run away.
---
&gt; I can't see why it's not possible from a technical point of view.
---
Not saying it isn't possible but that it might be more work to actually realize this. I mean, sure from our perspective just put them in a different group and it is easy but that might not be how the code does this.
---
And in the "discussion" with OP I already pointed this out that there are similarities which we already have but that requires player interaction with an NPC in the guild hall to switch teams.
---
In software development basically anything is possible, you just need to have the resources for it, specifically money and time.
---
And as I said already, I don't see how a dueling system would benefit the game really. The only way I could think of which makes a bit of sense would be to get the dueling players out of WvW. But adding a dedicated duel place in edge of the mists for example could work as well as they did for GvGs.
---
the problem I see is with what the community requests after such a thing goes live. "why can't we expand those duels to 5,10,20 people we could have gvgs in PvE zones".
---
"I cant affort sub for another game so fuck everyone else playing this game, thank god devs want to exploit these playerbase not the one I'm more into"

Love it, gonna loop it a few times &lt;3
---
[removed]
---
there are only a few raid encounter which aggo on toughness, some others do it with certain mechanics...like one boss simply shifts his focus arround 24/7 on all party members every 30 seconds where he just picks a new one.  
---
also in normal openworld / fractals / dungeons there is no tanking at all involved.  
---
generally in this game there is no real dedicated tank, chronos are just taken because they are already defensive through their weaponchoice. usually they run low toughness.  
---
this game is more like darksouls where you dodge duck dip and dodge to mitigate damage and use all the blocks and projectile reflects to mitigate any damage or simply kite out of an attack.  
---
if you go into the game and simply stack toughness, you will have a bad time in the endgame. i advise you to just level up as a normal dps dude and learn the game and how to dodge and get a feeling in general.  
---
even tanking in this game in raids doesn't look like: "i stay here and soak up everything". its more like: "oh, boss uses attack x now, i gotta dodge or block else i am dead".
---
Is it possible that they want a certain amount of maps before they add a queue?
---
Game mode can interfere with games that run multiple processes like GW2. It is a known issue that slows down the TP interface to a crawl and it could cause other problems.
---
As other have stated above however the most likely culprit is AMDs drivers that dont handle some old DX games well. Try the workarounds that were posted or hope they fix the issue.
---
Rabbit rank finisher is worse... It's the $0.01 tip of finishers, "Just wanted you to know that I didn't actually forget."
---
&gt; I never experienced problems buying cdkeys before.
---
Several big-name key resale sites have had game keys bought with stolen cards and those numbers have been tracked and accounts get locked if you try to use them. The general consensus is that it's safer to use an official retailer.
---
As I stated, I may not be good enough to talk about high elo thief. I think the swipe helps a bruiser type build where you stick on target and do consistent dps with your abillities and dodges and wait for the perfect moment to interupt with steal and chain it into more cc / dps.
---
I first tried to play the core thief s/d build. It was fun, but I dropped my elo from platin 1 to gold1 in less than a week with it. Then I scrapped the meta build(s) and made my own. And now I steadyly raise in elo with it and am at least close to g3 again. :'D
---
Idk if thief in very high elo is underpowered, but I learnt the hard way, that meta builds with medium player skill are very bad. The swipe as it is may hit the top tier elo, but it definitly makes the bruiser daredevil more viable.
---
Did any of the top tier ppl test "bruiser daredevil" and tried to also makro play like a bruiser, rather than +1 roamer? (Because my build - while still able to - is definitly  a worse +1 roamer than core thief s/d).
---
This is it right here. My thoughts are aligned with his. A little before HoT came out and forever after the weight of classes really has been skewed. While elementalist does deal a lot of damage now other classes also deal a lot of damage. This mostly just concerns the vitality stat but those stat allocations are kind of important.
---
Anyway my advice for elementalist is to literally play it like a piano because that’s how I get the most enjoyment by not having to linger autoattacking waiting for other skills to recharge. Overhaul your keybinds for this. If you have a programmable mouse great but if not re bind your function keys to be much more accessible and youll be able to switch elements a lot quicker and be able to respond easier as well.
---
Yeah...
---
Aww this is sweet! Love it.
---
What shaders are you using? It looks a bit weird
---
Perhaps is wasn't back in the store when you first checked? It isn't avaliable all year around and was put back in the store only yesterday.
---
Otherwise, it must be that some of the items in the pack are considered expansion content, since from what I can tell core accounts are not otherwise restricted in what they can get from the gem store.
---
Just to check you don't also have a free account - you have more than two character slots and more than three bag slots per character?
---
If none of those help, I'd suggest you submit a support ticket!
---
The class doesn’t matter much to me, as long as the player does what he’s meant to do properly.
---
why not make a sceenshot instead?
---
the shader is called phonecamera
---
GW2 has always been running bad on good hardware. I‘ve been playing on day one back then with my first computer equipped with an i5 2600 and GT 545. When I upgraded to an i7 5820k and a GTX 980 Ti it almost made no difference. And nowadays with my RTX 2080 and 2700X  it runs worse than ever with pretty harsh framedrops. I don’t think that it’s the fault of AMD, Intel or NVIDIA rather it’s ArenaNet not optimizing their old game for newer hardware.
---
No thx
---
I have PoF, still can't see the PoF preparation pack in the gem store
---
Makes me (cynically) wonder if, after the firings at Anet, word came down from on high that they needed to *squeeze* the player base a little harder this time, in the lead up to the next content announcement. Once people fully realize there’s no expansion coming, there’s going to be a bit of an exodus, so better reap those profits now.
---
&gt; 2v2/3v3/5v5 arena is what made WoW pvp terrible
---
WoW PvP is shit because certain classes are fucking useless without peel (Mostly anything ranged.)
---
Unranked in that game can be either 2v2 or 3v3 and if it's 2v2 enjoy not having a healer.
---
If you want to play ranked, you need a full premade - Most people want achievements from previous seasons and a lot of them just leave after first loss.
---
This is why WoW PvP is shit.

Amazing work [u/McLeoud](https://www.reddit.com/user/McLeoud/) thank you! I shall be donating on payday so you can buy yourself a coffee.
---
I disagree that they're undertuned. The game just places a much bigger emphasis on active defense.
---
&gt; Are there still classes that are needed a lot?
---
You can pretty much play any profession in any game mode, skill with the profession and knowledge about the game are worth more than just playing a certain profession.
---
For what is used for various content you can check the guilds that provide the builds like [Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/) for raids and [Discretize](https://discretize.eu/builds) for fractals. You can also look on [Metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki).
---
&gt; Is Weaver still a thing? I just played thru the story with my Thief.... do i need to play the PoF story to get my mounts on my Weaver as well?
---
Yes Weaver is still a thing as are the other Elite specs, some builds are more optimal than others but that really depends on the content you want to get into and is not a general thing. All masteries are account bound, if you have them unlocked once on your account they are available to every character on your account. That also includes lower level characters so you can ride your mount with your level 2 character but you are not able to accumulate EXP for new masteries (since the EXP goes to your level and not the mastery).
---
&gt; What is the Class to go right now?
---
whatever you find interesting! There is no best profession and even if there is you might not like it or can't get into it. Play what you find interesting or have the most experience with.
---
&gt; WvW: I need the Gift for the Bifrost... right now im running running running running and Die from roamers. I spent like 4 hours and got 4500 points. Any Ideas
---
WvW is not a content you play for points but rather do that over time. You have basically two options, roaming and zerging. For both you need different builds. However, for the [Gift of Bifrost](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_The_Bifrost) you don't need to play WvW. You need a Gift of battle for the Gift of Mastery that you then need for Bifrost and that can be acquired by selecting the Gift of battle WvW reward track. That can be completed through either patiently waiting and getting the points at max participation every 5 minutes in WvW or doing the WvW dailies and drinking the potions.
---
&gt; Stick to the plan with the bifrost? Or go for another Legendary (Probably go for Bifrost sell it and buy.... what?)
---
I wouldn't waste it, a legendary is not better than ascended weapons so you could just put it aside until you want to continue again. But that depends on what profession you choose in the end.
---
&gt; Sorry for London, not my main language.

Firstly, you’re trying to use a single person’s (yours) anecdotal experience as justification for your claim. 
---
Secondly, your also trying to equate the performance (FPS) of a single game (GW2) to mean poor stability/functionality of drivers. Those are not the same thing, but can be closely tied to one another.
---
If the card performs fine (stable) in most if not all other games but has issues with one game, then the issue usually lies with what is different between those experiences (I.e., not the AMD drivers that is constant between, but the patch/implementation of the game is at fault)
---
My wife’s RX580 performs perfectly fine in GW2 as well as my V64 and VII. But agin these experiences are my own and not indicative of the bigger picture, just my local experiences. We’ve also never had NVidia cards in these systems previous as they are fresh built systems. My laptop with an NVidia GPU has also has no issues, similar to my AND desktop cards.
---
Your issues moving from an NVidia to AMD (or vice versa) are legitimate issues felt by many who have also made the switch. Even performing a DDU of your previous GPU family sometimes doesn’t remove the issues and hiccups experienced. Many also have to do an almost clean install of the OS image. For most though it is imperative to DDU between on GPU family to another to minimize issues and headaches.
---
I’m not saying you’re not experiencing issues, and you may have DDU’d when moving from your 960 to the 580, but your single experience does not a systemic issue make. 
---
While people have different preferences (GFE vs Adrenalin, AMD vs NVidia, etc) over the last COUPLE of years AMD’s drivers have been quite impressive especially over the mess that was Catalyst. GFE has had its ups and downs. 
---
There was a QA stability test performed about a year ago that showed AMD had better driver stability over NVidia. However this test was commissioned and parts supplied by AMD, so the validity of the results require skepticism just the same if NVidia or Intel had done the same (and they both have in the past).
---
I love this so much, my boyfriend’s sister plays this song sometimes when we go out. I need to send this to her! She has played a little GW2 so I think she’d appreciate it.
---
So you propose changing all keyboards? Because when I say readily apparent I mean the symbol(s) itself is visible on the keyboard.
---
This seems to be the reason.
---
It's a slightly odd situation. The PoF prep pack was added, obviously, for PoF, but well after HoT came out - both expansions added free account share slots.
---
Also, they called it PoF Prep Pack - I assume their thinking was that most people buying this would be getting PoF, or at least have HoT.
---
Also, the cost of the items is 6900 gems if bought by themselves, so the 3500 cost is quite a discount in that sense. Not so bad for Anet if the customer has bought xpacs, but its a sort of cheap work around for someone who has never bought any and Anet miss out.
---
Seems intentional - they don't want non xpac owners buying this pack as they miss out on income.
---
Or maybe I am being too cynical? :-P
---
Id actually suggest not doing story until you are around lvl70, not because the story is difficult, but rather because you can then do the story back to back which helps a lot with immersion.
---
Now, without knowing much more details, here's a few tips to level up faster - or level up with a purpose.
---
1. Always use some kind of cheap food and utility consumable. They give you +exp bonus.
---
2. Join any guild with a guildhall to get access to the +experience buff from there, its a buff you get from the NPC in the guildhall tavern.
---
3. You can buy cheap fireworks (or draketails) from the trading post for another experience bonus.
---
4. Use the content guide, you can set it to different presets in options -&gt; first tab near the top -&gt; content guide. I usually set it to "ignore personal story" because I want to do that later.
---
5. Dont go for full map completion, but try to uncover all waypoints and do the heropoints, uncover points of interests and vistas that are on your way. I wouldnt bother with heart tasks yet, they can be quite tedious. Maps you are going to need for story are your homelands, and everything straits of devastation and further south. So uncovering those before starting story helps you later a lot.
---
6. Events are your sidequests in GW2, though escort events usually are quite boring, most are fun. Meta events are big event chains on each map, you can find them on the right side of your hud, though some are a bit cryptically worded. Id suggest using the chatcommand /wiki NameOfMap to get an idea about the meta events on your current map. Meta events, or worldboss events give quite nice exp and some useful loot for leveling up.
---
7. Mobs level up experience-wise in GW2, meaning, if a mob has been alive for a long time, it gives you topnotch exp on killing. So while uncovering waypoints, kill a mob here and there and if you see a big +bonus exp number pop up, stay there for a bit and kill everything in sight.
---
8. Dont neglect gathering materials, especially so called t3-t4 materials (around lvl 25-60) you can later on sell on the trading post and finance your first equipment with.
---
9. If you are stuck for a few levels - can happen around lvl50-70 - you can level up around 10 levels via leveling cooking. https://gw2crafts.net/ is a website that helps you level crafting without overspending too much, I usually put in my API key, then buy the rest and use all my available exp boosters (/wiki experience) before starting to craft.
---
10. Try to do daily achievements for the extra gold you get, and the writ(s) of knowledge. Imo, its easiest to do the PvP dailies on a not yet level 80 account, later on the WvW dailies are faster. But thats my personal opinion. PvP is a good idea either way, you get Tomes of Knowledge (1 level up per tome) from it.
---
Im sure Ive forgotten something, but, that should give you a good starting point. Something I want to point out though, is that GW2 is an MMORPG, and while the releases over the last 2 years slowly turned the game more and more into a single RPG, the beginning is purely mmo. That means discovering the world, doing events is the focus until Heart of Thrones, after that story became the focus. So if you are only playing GW2 because of the story, you might want to use that lvl80 boost and play through the story. Doesnt matter if you learn game mechanics or not - you dont need those for the story - so skipping that part if you arent planning on going for WvW, PvP, PvE instanced endcontent is a very valid way to go about it.
---
I see your dilemma. I only recently started raiding and got familiar with the mechanics needed for them. To be frank I try to finish my auto attack chain, but an issue I have is when I get quickness. Auto attacks start getting rly fast that I loose track of them more often than not. I guess its all in the training and getting used to the rotations.
---
In addition to the other comments, I would also mention to not use the Dragon Hunter trait line at this time since it is barely unlocked. You do not have access to the more "powerfull" traits since they are all locked.
---
I have not played Guardian a lot so someone else could recommend the traits to use or you can always check on [Metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guardian) for ideas.
---
To add to the above I've been using this guide since it was posted

&gt;abusing Stronghold to wintrade for easy rating
---
Can't you technically do that on Conquest too?
---
That's why you just pick "all modes" and play whatever you get. Like you can in unranked with Conquest and Stronghold.
---
I don't know which profession you're running, but personally I like to level up (and unlock) signets first. Signets provide passive effects (such as quickness) which make open world pve easier.

Looking at the gem-gold exchange rate, there is no squeezing right now. Response to the "sales" seems very low, cause of how bad the offers are. I doubt it's lot different for the cash-&gt;gems buyers

it is certainly not, maybe in the lower ranks, i dont know, but you lack mobility on it compared to core s/d, even more with the portal they recently patched in. Its just straight up worse than s/d core.

I will say that I don't always agree with some of the decisions that Anet has made over the years but I can say a big heartfelt Thank You to all the people who are working and have worked on this game. it has brought hours of fun. Thank you everyone at Anet past and present :)
---
These builds sound interesting, I really want to be able to focus on learning and nailing the boss mechanics - which mirage build are you using? Assuming DD is power?
---
That is mostly because the only places we get to meet the Kodan in GW2 now is the Norn lands, but the lore says "They once resided in restless seas further north than the Far Shiverpeaks." 
---
The following two links give good lore  [Sanctuary\_(city)](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sanctuary_(city)) &amp;  [The\_Dragonstorm](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Dragonstorm). 
---
Which implies that the first Kodan to go up to the mountainous Shiverpeaks further south of the Sanctuaries was the first descendant of the Norn. I believe it was Jormag that knocked the sanctuaries into the lake/sea of Frostgorge Sound, as they usually lived in the seas further north along the coasts.

This is your best friend for 90% of things.
---
There are new players and there are guild for new players. My advice? Just play the game. Your play style makes the difference. 1st gate a grip on the game and find what you like and then look into end content like rading and legendary gear. Also Ascended gear has same stats as legendary gear.

&gt; raiding, I don't even understand the meaning of the group titles on the LFG
---
* Chrono - Mesmer elite specialization with the build focused on boon support
---
* Tank - A boon chrono with the highest toughness of the group for bosses with toughness mechanic
---
* Dps - Any dps build. There is power and condi(tion)
---
* Healers - Usually a druid (ranger spec) and any other heal build
---
* Kiter - there are bosses where one or more player has to do a fun mechanic of being seperated from the group to do a certain mechanic. There is 1 kiter at Dhuum (w5b4) to pull adds away from an npc and 3 pylon kiter at Qadim the Peerless (w7b3) where each has to stand next to a tower kind of structure and just attack from range, if no player is next to the pylon it will make the fight impossible to progress
---
* Pusher - usually a druid at Soulless Horror (w5b1) who uses a longbow to push an exploding add away from the group.
---
* Backwarg - Someone who kills the warg that spawns behind the group (w3b1)
---
* Tower - a chrono who uses portal to teleport players up to the tower in order to secure it (w3b1)
---
Forest Goths are outmoded.
---
Jade Sea hobos FTW.

---
Is that why they have specific traits just for their new weapons? LUL
---
I guess I'm in the minority, but I like the Zhaitan fight the way it is. It doesn't feel lame or unfinished tp me, it feels really different and interesting and epic. Finishing it off on the ground in melee like any trash mob would feel lame, IMO.
---
That said, giving us the chance to play S1 in some fashion again would be super cool, but I'll be very surprised if that's what they're working on. Best case scenario is new elite specs alongside S5, and they spend the time talking about those. More realistic scenario is no elite specs, but a variety of other things that they can certainly spend 45 minutes talking about.

---
Superfluous post, sadly: A few days ago they announced that they will most likely explore Scarlet's War in more fractals.
---
Oh, so condi reaper still uses greatsword?
---
I'm imagining something like comparing strings with reflection and therefor being hard to refactor
---
Well I dont think there will be a rework for that fight, having zhaitan as a raid boss in the mists or something like that,  sound way more possible to me. The work that is required to do such a big  bossfight for a dead content just sound not worth for me.
---
+30 minutes for the rage to cool down ofc
---
Probably they won't ever bring it back as it was, since lets be honest there was quite some bad stuff in it (the fucking signposts n stuff). If they do it, they probably do it in some other form or compressed to its core. Stuff like the marionette could be implemented as a 'hard boss' and some story instances would be reworked as fractals.  
---
What I expect for the LS5 announcement: 45mins of talking about what they needed to do for their design and teasers about features to come with LS5 basically telling us what some of us allready expect: A combination of expansion and LS5. So probably 10 mins of teasing us with some kind of promo that will be simultaniously be uploaded to youtube. Then telling where we will go Far  Shiverpeaks/Cantha, background on that stuff as in what races will will encounter and how it will look like. Then we get the rest of the presentation filled with interviews with designers/art/sound devs about some stuff they've worked on proudly. And that's it.
---
This is spot on! Really great job.
---
They aren't holding back expansion worthy features when they are ready they will be released. Like the suns refuge, new mounts. I do expect at hint at expansion 3 maybe even a name for it but not a complete reveal.
---
It's fine most of the time, but in big fights in wvw, it gets noticeably lower, even with the dx12 thing.  Dropping player models to lowest helps, but it would be nice if that wasn't necessary.
---
Yes because showing appreciation for them negleciating the game for a year is good. You are part of the reason the game is in this state instead of its true potential.  
---
People like you made them believe they could get away by minimal effort in the game while devoloping secret 2 side projects
---
Thank you :)
---
Its almost criminal if you think about it, a pretty good MMO being left aside for 2 other side projects .. who thought that was a good idea?
---
They're not going to devote 45 minutes and a live audience to announcing they're remaking old content. 
---
It's just not exciting enough. Like, I get that you'd be excited about it, but you'd do it once and then never touch it again. They're not gonna pin the future of the game on old stuff. 
---
It'll be nice if they ever do release Season 1 stuff in some form. Really, it would. It's bothersome that a good portion of the game's storyline is told via NPC and youtube videos. But it's not going to be a profit driver.
---
Is there any way to configure the cinematic conversation camera to a different angle or position. It's kinda annoying that I can't see my norn character's face when using a widescreen monitor.
---
I don't see how reworking the Zhaitan fight is a good idea.  It basically invalidates content already played.  The story should be focused on moving forward, not tinkering with old content like George Lucas did.  
---
I have read somewhere that LWS1 would have to be recreated from scratch because it's code is just not up to snuff with all the tweaks made to the engine over the years.  While it would be nice, again it's not moving the narrative forward so it too does not sense unless it's as a new fractal.
---
I knew my canthan senses were tingling...

Hi, it seems like qualtrics blocks some vpn services. This might be to stop some people from retaking surveys on the same IP.

Darn thing was published 10 years ago, you really think they'd advertise their thesis now?
---
Hey man, just wanted to thank you for all the good work you're doing here. &lt;3
---
Dont expect any significant changes to what we got with lw3and 4. They will praise lw model like they did on some recent interviews, they will claim reinventing the game again while nothing will change. we gonna get new maps, new mounts and scraps of raiding, fractals, pvp and wvw. The most you can count on are elite specs.
---
Man this looks gorgeous, I love it
---
oh but we do have ranked Spvp still or did it merged with the automated tournaments ?
---
it seems to be a completely other client for the chinese version since you don't even have this region in the western client, only NA and EU. So I wouldn't even know how to get there except to buy a chinese version?!
---
Now they need to craft the dipping sauce for all those spring rolls.
---
dang I see thank you for the info!
---
Don't expect anything relating to a third expansion until LS5 ends at the earliest. We never hear about expansions until the story is ready for their announcement, and we know that this is involving Living World already. Don't feed people this type of information please
---
Thanks!
---
What type of information I said what I expect Anet will do its called speculation now if I had gone "There will be an announcement of expansion 3 and the name will be revealed" your comment makes sense but I was speculating.
---
Or you can just ask in general map chat - you'll be surprised at how helpful the average player is, and you almost never (ever) see anyone discussing Chuck Norris in /m
---
If you’re in open world and need survivability just switch to the trait “might makes right” in the final tier of your strength trait lines it helps a lot. Also “for great justice” is a great skill and with the might makes right trait it will heal with the might it gives. And ya banners are only for if you’re doing large group events or bosses. Also i think earlier I may have mentioned mint berry swirl ice cream, it’s a very cheap food that gives you more sustainability that I use all the time in open world. Hope those help
---
Besides these two fights though, I don't think a lot of season 1 was memorable from a gameplay perspective. It'd be good to bring S1 back from a lore perspective and coherence though.
---
Content with no re-playability... That's just what we need right now...
---
Is there a hand-to-hand class that has been announced on the past few years ? I've been playing the game for a long time and dropped it, but I really want a monk-type fighter in the game
---
&gt;Oh what do you mean Chinese servers are completely seperate?
---
My understanding is that Chinese online games almost always have their own separate versions to the west. There's the issue of government censorship, but also different cosmetic options and microtransaction models to meet the differing expectations of Chinese players. I think the Chinese version of GW2 is a drastically different game.
---
&gt;I stopped cause i felt bored and didnt think anything else was to do now there seems to be a lot.
---
One of my biggest complaints back in the vanilla days is that there were only like 3 level 80 maps, and not even much to do on those. Basically every map they have added since 2012 has been level 80. There's also new content such as raids and Fractals of the Mists. At this point, the vast majority of content in this game is very late-game or end-game content.
---
Nah. As much of a meme as it is, Season 4 content is still being played. Dragonfall was a very active meta before the recent festival; it's quite profitable and fun. There are a bunch of active collections, including obvious Vision keeping players in the maps. I just spent the last ~2 weeks gathering the Inscribed Shards I needed for the backpiece to finish that section of Vision, and every time I did the meta, there was a big group with me (and that's a pretty awful meta, I think we can all agree). 
---
That's a far cry from redoing a story-instance boss, or remaking S1 content as instanced content (because you can't do it as open world again).
---
No, no. We still got it. Ranked, unranked, personal, tournaments. The whole slew.
---
I would say that a large percentage of Competitive sPVP/WvW and Instanced endgame players make up "frustrated veterans." 
---
It's hard to discuss because of the, "Everything in GW2 is endgame" mentality.  I think there's a lot of overlap amongst [various platform issues](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cmgjxt/greg_miller_will_host_the_august_30th_living/ew3dt6e/) and I think that's what makes it so difficult to pin down.  It's a spectrum; not everyone is frustrated, but I think it's also just easier on people to say, "Frustrated Veterans" than it is ^ Competitve PvP/WvW &amp; Instanced Endgame.
---
I think a lot of people have issues with the game.  Maybe they're small issues, medium issues or large-scale/systematic issues.  I don't think the intent is to misrepresent opinions so much as just represent the group they themselves identify with.
---
Thanks for your answer, too bad we don't have real hand-to-hand class, it would be really cool, I'll try it though.
---
If you don't need the Lvl 80 booster you would be better off waiting for bag and character slots to go on sale. The keys are not worth it.
---
_I see what you did there_
---
Lmao didn’t even see it myself haha
---
&gt;oh but we do have ranked Spvp still or did it merged with the automated tournaments ?
---
They are separate things with separate rankings.  Ranked sPvP is Duo or Solo queue only now (solo only at higher ranks) so no fully constructed teams, which is where the ATs come in.  The ATs also offer them the ability to do specialized sPvP events that shake up the standard conquest formula, though for now it has been limited to "Dwayna's Duos" a.k.a. 2v2 Team Deathmatch.  I would still like to see them make adjustments to Stronghold mode PvP, add an extra map or two, and build regular ATs around it.
---
ranked is still there with regular seasons for "easy" legendary armor precursor farm
---
Anet already struggle to balance conquest, and the population is quite low, so I'm not sure adding a 2v2 queue (at least a ranked queue) would be good for PvP as balance would be a mess in 2v2 and there could be population issues.
---
I would like a 2v2 queue personally, but not sure how it would work out.
---
However, more regularly 2v2 ATs and events would be really nice.

Ok just checking, you could try a round of DDU and driver reinstall, but that probably won’t do anything extra. But it only takes a few minutes. There was an article that talked about how RDNA tried to ease the headache of games still developed for GCN. So since GW2 is so old this may be one of those things.

Thank you ! That really help

If **everything** in the package seems like stuff that you want, buy it. If you want any of them individually, wait for rest of the sales as they will probably be discounted individually.
---
Why would you make all of your characters Charr...? I guess my response to your question depends on your answer to this. 
---
If you're one of those masculine guys who picked Charr because they like guns tanks and wars play Norn: Norn devote their lives to getting drunk with their drinking buddies and going hunting. 
---
If you pick Charr because you're a raging furry, pick Asura: it'll give you a Siamese cat/Chihuahua/naked mole rat feel.
---
If you picked Charr because you have Alzheimers and forgot about the other characters, pick Charr again.

Hi,
---
Please read my thread about what I want and expect out of ANet's announcement, and get on-board my personal hype train, so I can have you be as disappointed as I will be myself when my expectations are not met; instead of waiting for the announcement and seeing what it's about.
---
PS: No!!! What you want is a waste of time. I'd rather they be focusing on the future of the game instead of constantly looking back.
---
Here's hoping he doesn't go shoot up a mall.
---
Yes, but its an Epic-Store exclusive Sims4 DLC
---
You might lose more or less 1 or 2k dps by playing with A/A + GS, but you win by being more flexible. It's the best if you want to run the same build in sPvE and Open World.
---
You seem to be having a hard time understanding how gw2 works. My advice is: erase everything you know about mmorpgs and most of conventions. Gw2 likes to have its own rules and often does things differently from most of games. With that in mind you will soon adapt.
---
One more thing:
---
Gears: help only if you know what to do. 
---
Player own skills and practice: means 90% of how effective you will be in game so, practice, experiment, read, practice and practice and practice. 
---
Good luck.
---
It does indeed.
---
Sure 2v2 usually take longer than 2 minutes which is why I like this debuff. It will make fights short and not stale. Further as soon as the 2 min mark is reached most support builds will be in a rather bad position. So e.g. fb after 2 min will not be able to keep up the scourge while you can keep kiting them. 
---
Add. barrier should also be limited after the 2 min mark.
---
You should quit now then, because there's no expansion coming until (maybe) LS5 ends.
---
LS5 is also due to contain expansion level of content, but released in bite sizes instead of a large chunk as an expansion.
---
LS4 had extra mounts added among other things (which are expansion level content), and legendary runes/sigils (which you'd expect from an expansion) added alongside LS4.
---
Their own real downfall has been not having a proper schedule and far too much delay between content releases...not the actual content released.
---
I would buy the unbreakable tools if they could be used from the shared inventory slots rather than having to unequip and re-equip them each time I change character. That's why I've always just stuck with the orichalcum ones.
---
Ok I'm convinced. We need a bard elite.
---
more like 150 to 200 gold cheaper
---
45 minutes/9 = 5 minutes of each new spec

The title page should give you enough information to find the person. (not linking to what I found because it feels hella creepy)
---
"Every other class atm can do the duelist, bruiser, or fighter role better than the thief can."
---
Maye that's why my climb towards g3 is (was) so slow. I stick to it, because I have A LOT of fun playing this. I kinds got sick of ranger, warry and revenant and wanted to know why so many ppl hate over thiefs and how hard it is to play this class.
---
It's only for hot join so don't worry
---
The incredible lack of support for spvp is one of the many reasons why I've taken such a long break from the game and if they don't fix up on it, I'm not coming back. When they first announced this 2v2/3v3 map I was excited to come back but it's a shame that isn't the case. Please sort something out anet, I want to play your game but you give me reasons not to.
---
I wan't EVERYTHING and RIGHT NOW! Also I don't want to put any effort into it!
---
Every time I see sh*t like this I wanna say *"Welcome to MMORPG. First time?".*
---
It might help to say what steps you took for installation.
---
Take a look.
---
have you tried gamer mouse? the kind that have 12 buttons under the thumb. you can use the mouse software to put a lot of key options under that. do note you're not allowed to have those keys do more than one action at a time, else you hit the anti cheating software. It sux i know.
---
Thanks for this. I'll give it a try.
---
&gt; I want EVERYTHING and RIGHT NOW! Also I don't want to put any effort into it! Fix it!
---
These 2 lines kinda contradict each other though.
---
Timegates mean log in and do something for like 5mins and log out = 0 effort.
---
No timegate means you can put the effort it and grind it all out in 1 go.
---
You could skip the time gate on crafting and buy the stuff from the TP.
---
I feel like I’m missing something... did they announce that it was only a new map for custom arena and nothing else?  The only thing I saw was the teaser announcement on the page that described the map and variant.
---
Am I assuming too much that the teaser means we are getting 2v2 as a queueable mode? Did anet say it _wouldn't_ be?
---
So much this. Sizes and prices. When my main guild is quite small - around 15 people - the huge land is useless and feels expensive. There are even smaller guilds so...
---
Can we make this reality
---
Thanks I'm looking forward to trying PvP when I get a little more experienced :)
---
What a horrible choice of music.
---
The files should be copy pasted to the main Guild Wars 2 directory - this will merge the contents in bin64 and create a new addons folder as well.
---
"You fell for my ruse - I was merely pretending to be retarded!"
---
Hello teapot
---
He makes these videos because he's an idiot there are no other reasons.
---
Is this the people's concept of fitting music?
---
Yes, spiky bois.
---
&gt; Why do so many of the customers agree with anet to let 'real' endgame content die/stay rather neglected It really is quite disturbing
---
Because they don't. ;)
---
Ah, I see. Thank you very much!
---
All the things you say I do understand, but again:, if you already a mediocore player in a mediocore player ladder the "will wsrry win against mesmer" won't have to end as you think it should. Because maybe one of these guys sucks at the game. You basically exactly described, why a mediocore micro played roaming thief will most like suck ass. And that's actually my first person experience. It IS easier to climb, if you play a more versatile build.
---
Thief can do his macro best, when you can kinda trust into the cspabillities of your teammates. But there are way too many games of pure chaos and it get worse the lower you are in the ladder.
---
Suddenly there are condi thiefs killing ppl 2v1 at close or an inting warrior, always at the wrong spot and just inting into fights, ect.
---
I was in quiet some of such games and with proper macro I was able to stall / make us loosing slower, but I would never be able to turn it. As Holo on the other hand you CAN carry a team fight in gold 1, gold 2 and I'm pretty sure in gold 3 still and win that for your team.
---
Maybe I'm all wrong and I'm just a better bruiser player and that's why I am better at playing a lackluster bruiser thief build rather than a perfect roamer / +1, but maybe not. :)
---
Anyway, I actually don't care too much about may ladder, otherwise I wouldn't play thief. I play it, because some day it made click in my head and I wanted to fkin' play thief, because it's fun as heck! :)
---
I dropped a whole bracket for this fun and am rly happy with my self made bruiser build. ;)
---
Everyone attempting lowman kills are multiclass players. They would never force a specific duo of two classes, but instead try combinations of classes that have the tools to handle the fight's mechanics.
---
While timegates are a cheap way of getting players to play longer, its somewhat excusable because GW2 doesn't have a sub fee. WoW has timegates and a sub fee, pretty much guaranteeing next months sub if you want to reach your goal
---
Amazing dude, now i need a gw2 version of the full song!
---
My guitar swinging solo wasnt enough D:?

Exploit aside, this is pretty cool. I love it when players can rockclimb to places not originally intended.

But yeah, I hope they add a boulder somewhere along this path to stop players from taking this uneven advantage.
---
Google and map chat
---
Nah sometimes there's also be necro/fb
---
Cool animation, horrendously unfitting music.
---
Thanks, this was driving me nuts as I was doing what you were doing.
---
How did you stumble across this? I remember from my time at the Uni that I had to visit this site a lot!
---
It's also about GW1. Not GW2
---
the chinese servers are running a completely different build of the game with many of the same features but many differences, specifically on the monetization side of things. It's more similar to a KMMO, with a premium pass type system with loyalty rewards. Basically lets you buy legendaries for real money, stuff like that. So it's not like NA/EU where you can transfer but the game is identical, no.
---
Unless the bag specifically says "affected by Magic Find", you don't need to worry about MF boosts while opening the bag.
---
Then do it in sPvP instead wtf is the issue...
---
As I'm trying to get into Elementalist with my last slot, is Celestial still considered good for them or would I be better with a different stat set?
---
Scammers just try to pacify, they know something much harsher is starting to build up against them.
---
Fuck them, their lootboxes and everyone who keeps defending them. A widespread ban can't come soon enough.
---
....snowballs in hell???

&gt;it would require the disclosure of the **relative rarity** or probabilities of obtaining randomized virtual items in games
---
Don't they already do this with the rarity? It's not a percentage but it seems to meet the requirement.
---
Honk
---
Let me rephrase that:
---
Please don't make spawn a mount and glider-free zone
---
I feel like the amount of effort involved to cap it is probably fair for a cap tbh.
---
&gt; $72 for a custom piece from artists like
---
Not a fan of their art. I think they are fairly mediocre compared to other artists for which I would pay (and paid) a lot more than $72. 
---
I would pay (a fuck lot) more for a giant red painting with a blue line on one of its sides*, even though you would think it's insane but none of us would be in the wrong. To each his own. 
---
My tastes? I think the first two use a shit ton of brushes in photoshop to get their point across and look tacky, the third one is an imitation of something Kekai Kotaki might do and the fourth one, while the best from the set, in a different context I wouldn't even know it's about Guild Wars 2. 
---
In conclusion, the last line of my initial comment was for people like you.
---
&gt; Again, this is just my take on it, some other people might like it.
---
you can, but since noone queued for Stronghold over conquest, the same 2 or 3 teams would queue for it and wintrade 100x faster than you ever could in conquest
---
thats not what she meant...
---
GW2 is not available on a console.
---
Do you understand what the article is about?
---
All MF you need in rewards to Silverwastes is when opening chests and defeating enemies there.
---
The only bags affected by MF are 'caches' and 'loot boxes' found in PvP and WvW tracks, and those the specifically say so.
---
I think you missed the part where it said “also avaialable” - so you don’t need to do WvW for the weapons if you would rather PvP.
---
&gt;Warnecke said that in addition to the major console manufacturers, “many of the leading video game publishers” who are members of the ESA, the trade body that represents the gaming industry, will “implement a similar approach.” Those publishers include Activision Blizzard, Bandai Namco Entertainment, Bethesda, Bungie, Electronic Arts, Take-Two Interactive, Ubisoft, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment, and Wizards of the Coast, the ESA said in a blog post.
---
the climb you made requires glider at points and can only be done in zones you own, so it might be unlikely other colours can get in.
---
The only sympathy I have for people is when they want a 4th legendary backpack.  Since the _only_ avenue for that atm is WvW.  I’d rather fractal or PvP, but until then, WvW it is.
---
I'd be great if they created a 'refurbishing' team to upgrade old outdated content, but it should not take resources from future content. 
---
Maybe when the side stories team is done with updating the festivals they could get to it.
---
&gt; The thing is...you can't get exact number. It is random.
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say here - Are you saying there are no percentages behind the boxes? lol
---
My leafy green boy appreciates your love. &lt;3
---
However, my Genderqueer norn nervously asks if they can be part of the Good Boys(TM) club.
---
Thank you mate. The marines made my day with this screenshot, i've done a space marines too but doesn't look like those one.
---
I don't get your point. If it's 0.005% than I know the exact probability in numbers. If one can't work with that he/she should repeat some classes instead of gaming...
---
&gt; Some notable ESA member publishers who haven't made such a commitment include 505 Games, Capcom, CI Games, Deep Silver, Disney Interactive Studios, Epic Games, Focus Home Interactive, Gearbox Publishing, GungHo, Intellivision Entertainment, Kalypso, Konami, Magic Leap, NCsoft, Natsume, Nexon, Rebellion, Riot Games, Sega, Square Enix, THQ Nordic, Tencent, and Marvelous.
---
Its just a remark at the end.
---
Can we just skip the notification phase and get right to classifying them as gambling, raising the rating of all games including loot boxes to 18+ and bringing in gambling regulations.
---
This disclosure step is just delaying the more important outcome - recognizing and regulating loot boxes for what they are.
---
This is the Guilded Hollow guild hall, one of the original two from HoT (there is only one other addition since - a Vabbi themed one from PoF).
---
The decorations are from the current Festival of the Four winds.
---
&gt; I don't think any of the listed companies have actually stated that they will be outright rejecting any push to reveal their drop rates. They just haven't made such a commitment to reveal them as of yet.
---
So what your saying is that NCsoft are probably going to do it but they are too lazy to cash in on the free publicity from saying they are?
---
IS there a list of members of ESA that publicly said that they won't ever do it? Because I don't think there is. Because that would be stupid PR. Silence and inaction says a lot and NCSoft doesn't deserve coddling.
---
[I can link logical fallacies as well.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance)
---
&gt; Argument from ignorance, also known as appeal to ignorance (in which ignorance represents "a lack of contrary evidence"), is a fallacy in informal logic. **It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true.**
---
ANet has no power in this regard (or, really, most regards). NCSoft sets the parameters, ANet is the one who has to do it, and no one can say shit without being fired/blacklisted so no one does.
---
**Argument from ignorance**
---
Argument from ignorance (from Latin: argumentum ad ignorantiam), also known as appeal to ignorance (in which ignorance represents "a lack of contrary evidence"), is a fallacy in informal logic. It asserts that a proposition is true because it has not yet been proven false or a proposition is false because it has not yet been proven true. This represents a type of false dichotomy in that it excludes the possibility that there may have been an insufficient investigation to prove that the proposition is either true or false. It also does not allow for the possibility that the answer is unknowable, only knowable in the future, or neither completely true nor completely false.

Then don't complain that you can't swipe your credit card to get the reward. If you can't get it you won't have it.
---
haha. I like to said in game that i'm a roleplayer, so i die and help my team with my spirit.
---
Thanks a lot.
---
As someone with developing carpal tunnel, this would be amazing. 
---
Would love to see this-- as I did action camera-- become something more than a side project.
---
Thank you!
---
Love that wand. And only a few people use it.
---
Lmao comparing this to endorsing slavery. I'm just saying every game has timegates to a certain extent, not that I like it. I just prefer it being not in my main gameplay but in secondary objectives like crafting or collections if it needs to be there is all I'm saying.
---
Thanks, i will try to share the other cosplay so :)
---
Uh...
---
Same thing with FFXIV. It also stacks timegates on top of subfees.
---
Any way to get my hands on the Tyrian Tarot, these days?
---
But that's PvP related and would divide the friendliest community ever, Anet would never let that happen.
---
Shame.

I kind of feel like the rune master has over taken the silver fed, with a 5% less chance of salvaging tares, but with a 15% better chance to salvage upgrades, for 30 less copper than the silver fed
---
The issue is that some players think that the game should be balanced around opening Chak Caches and refuse to play anything but open world PvE to get rewards
---
Make sure you communicate better with your sons, so they don't all end up with personality defects (other than wonderful Sanguinius).
---
That might be your problem there.
---
What DID you mean? Because you DON'T have to play WvW to get the weapon skins. You CAN if you WANT to. OR you can play PvP. Because these are PvP weapon skins. Same like Obsidian weapon skins.
---
Jimi Hendrix was (famously) left handed. Not sure how that would affect his use of a greatsword, but a mean part of me wanted to point it out.
---
Great cosplay!
---
Have you been roleplaying as him during the Boss rush event? Because if so i saw you once at the Shadow Behemoth, made my day :)
---
The Mac Dad and The Daddy Mac will make you jump straight into Veloka.
---
so a spec solely for pvp...
---
It also has skills like palm strike or whatever it's called - you have physical skills for utility which are quite monklike.
---
*Are you sure about that?*
---
Some people slot some in pvp/wvw. I'm gonna be going with Marauder for my ascended trinkets and leave armor Zerk exotics till I'm ready to craft ascended, then I'll decide what I want to run those as (we can switch the stats later on them, I love that).    
---
I'll also build up a separate exotic set for heal/support.     
---
Celestial has to many useless stats depending on your role, and toughness is almost always useless on an ele.
---
Hahaha
---
You're serious? HA HA HA HA HA HA
---
Considering you would barely auto attack in sword anyways by rotation standards, you could probably get away with going axe main hand esp for open world where some range is helpful at points.
---
When I last played, the optimal Tempest Build used either Staff or D/WH for PvE. 
---
What balance / skill changes have occured that Scepter/WH is now the best?
---
I remember Scepter only being used to stack might, long, long ago. It always had terrible AoE.
---
Not a new thing.  It's a rift in reality.  They appeared with the release of Episode 6, and can be 'repaired' with a Skyscale and the appropriate mastery, allowng for the collection of Volatile Magic and a Mistborn Mote.
---
Do we have any of them for a preview, like a chatcode or something?
---
Damn, I was almost certain that's a new thing as this area is not that active and sometimes Anet likes to put in some hints.
---
Need a help cub? [Check out this while waiting](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/343/account-support-helping-us-help-you#latest)
---
Don't worry, a gem store version with updated graphics will drop soon in case you miss out on these!
---
Lots of changes, many nerfs to staff directly and a bunch of buffs to other weapons along with lots of tempest changes. You can find the power DPS tempest build [here for raids](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/power/) and the (slightly outdated) [fractal build here](https://discretize.eu/builds/elementalist/power-tempest). Can also check [metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Elementalist) for more variations and open world builds.
---
&gt; a step in a less predatory, more ethical direction.
---
We are talking about a publisher. Why should they do anything that even has the slightest chance if reducing their revenue?
---
they are all over the place. originally there was a whole achievement section related to these, that got stealth removed for unknown reasons shortly before people could first get their hands on the mount.
---
Ok, thanks for your reply :)
---
This sub has been getting a decent amount of similar surveys, but yours is the first to include and acknowledge non-binary people. Thank you so much for this, you have my favor.
---
He protec
---
... but he also attac
---
Wuuut, that sounds awesome !
---
With alts you can get quite a lot every day, just do hearts on every character. Gathering and events can also net you some currency. It's a time consuming process if you start from scratch, so don't get burnt out by repeating the same hearts multiple times a day.
---
See I agree this this to a point. But there are casual WvW players and casual PvP players that are here for a long time and they're' fine. I don't know any casual raiders personally so I won't comment on that.
---
The other side of that coin is that if a people here it enough, that veterans are angry and no one says anything in reply to that, then people who don't know will believe it to be true. As a veteran with a daresay more hours in the game than most people complaining, I almost feel obligated to say there is another side of the coin...not for the person who's made the post, but the other people who are going to read it. I don't want any veteran talking for all veterans. I don't want to talk for all veterans. 
---
Too many people are too quick to believe what they read, particularly if they see it repeated enough. And there are enough load screens in the game for me to post here every time I see it. lol
---
As someone who only has time after work to play wvw, my favorite game mode, I know that feeling all to well. I do what I can with new living world episodes but I understand I'm just not going to be decked out in legendaries and all that.
---
Do the easiest heart on each of your alts and buy currency for karma
---
You can safely ignore crafting till 80. The only thing before that that it's a little good for, is to get you some levels, if you really hate leveling. You'd need some gold to buy mats if you weren't farming though, so that would mean that mostly people who have leveled other characters would be doing that.
---
One really big achievement, not a dedicated section
---
They will release a gemstore version that’s ten times better anyway.
---
&gt; Wizards of the Coast
---
They don't publish video games, they just license the IP right?
---
I've actually formatted/reloaded a couple times since getting this card. There's only so much I can do on my end. :/
---
Back in my day we had 3 countries we could visit! *old person noise*
---
Omg. Yasss
---
Chill did not help. Thank you though.
---
It seems to work like a stimpack.  
---
Skyscale fly.  Get tired.  Fly through floating VM orb...
---
“Ahhhh that’s the stuff!”
---
And then skyscale fly more.
---
Gave Anti-lag a try. No joy. Thank you though.
---
fabulous
---
Gotta add more desaturation until black and white like an old photo that we'll never get.
---
you know what is shittier than saying a game is dead, is when a person go out of their way to make a video about a certain topic, but not commit enough to use his/her real voice and expect people to be like "damn he/she is right".
---
You finish the rest of the warclaw achievement.
---
I'm pretty sure they mean the rarity as in "Oh there's only 10 of those in the game" as opposed to the item colour system that we have.
---
what you mean is the support cannot delete it from their end
---
Pretty funny, actually. Hated the robot voice though.  I've said stuff like this all along. Hyperbole doesn't really win arguments.  Don't know that I needed to watch a whole video about it though. Bit overkill.
---
Trying to police what people say on the internet is like trying to teach kids to enjoy reading. You might win a few hearts and minds, but most of the time you're not going to make a huge dent. lol
---
CANTHA CONFIRMED!
---
Is it just Fanta Sea?
---
Okay that too.
---
What's the most profitable pvp reward track from a raw gold standpoint?
---
I use crafting to level up my alts when i run out of tomes
