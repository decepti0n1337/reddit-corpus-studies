&gt; If you think its elistism to use basic game mechanics in end game content you are probably too sensitive
---

---
Where did I said that?...
---
None of the previous questions was about using basic game mechanics. Maybe you should read stuff properly first.
---
---
---
What about those players who also knew for a fact that their key was ok and then got their account terminated because it turned out it was not.... Lots of those posts here on reddit and they were also dead certain.
---
Getting an account hijacked because of pro passwords like: Hallo123, GW2PaZZword, or MunchesterUn1ted, is pretty stupid.
---
Get creative, think of a Neologism and put random numbers somewhere.
---
If you can't remember it at first write it down and put the paper under your keyboard. That's where I hide mine. Don't tell anyone.
---
After a short while you won't need it anymore.
---
It usually coincides with the break-bars on the main boss.  The gimmick being, new shiny skill = new shiny usage  If you get it outside of the break-bar then someone said that it one-shots the spectral-flame adds or something.
---
YES please! Then i would actaully use them!!!
---
It has been fixed. Thank you! :)
---
I mean, if you don't get any enjoyment out of killing a difficult boss, then yea, Raids are a waste of time.   
---
But then, what is enjoyment? Loot? Gold? None of these things mean anything. If you don't get enjoyment out of a challenge, out of using the potential of your class/build, whats the point in even playing? You could play Candy Crush, if the only enjoyment is opening a loot box

You can play power chrono and condi mirage.
---
Why would they be upset? They can still see their own, why should i be forced to watch something i find looking like a unicorn throwed up and really hurts my eye?
---
I would Just make the Armor and wait with the weapons until you can buy them from Fractals, WvW, PvP or Raiding.
---
It is. And it seems like every thread lately seems to turn into it eventually. I haven't seen anything like it at all in the other MMO subreddits I browse. Sure, there are jokes about one side or the other, or a couple of people that take things too far, but here it's fucking relentless. As usual, with most things in life, it's the vast middle ground that gets ignored while the bullshit from the extreme points of view are all that gets attention.
---
Think of your 1st best friend.  Now add the letters "ee" to it.  Think about a second best best friend you had since.  Add their name and then add the sequence "95z".
---
That should give you give an unique password.  If not, tell me what fails, and I can give you many, many more suggestions.
---
Unique passwords are important.  If you use the same password or a password someone else used for another game and that gets hacked, your account is in jeopardy.  Anet has one of the better password systems I've seen.  Additionally, be sure to add two factor authentication.  Your account is important, treat it like it is with good security.
---
Additionally, never share your account with anyone.
---
Upvoting because I think you’re right, but as a genre, this is horrible for MMOs.
---
It's not at all double development time. They're not going to recreate the entire encounter, environment, assets, and all, from scratch for a raid version. They'd copypaste almost everything and just need to tweak mechanics to be less forgiving and add one or two new ones. Probably 1.1x as much development time at most.
---
The first raid boss had a pretty cool way to introduce mechanics, they could try that again.
---
For me i just want the tick box that let me remove all the unicorn puke both from me and other players so my world becomes normal again.
---
I also have a a lot of infusions on my bank that i don't use because of the visual effects, would be nice if they could be untickable too so i can start using them for the stat upgrade. 
---
As for wardrobe, it is hard for me to say, since i don't enjoy it. I use the infusion that make my lining purple, and even that starts to annoy me after just a month or so :D 
---
But that does not mean that others would feel they made efforts that is invalid if it can be used as wardrobe... 
---
To be fair i should probably not have much of a opinon about it because it does not bother me if they do or don't, so it is up to the people who have it to say really.
---
If druid takes Lingering Light vs GotL you'll lose your easy might stack but you'll triple your healing. I can guarantee it can be done, most likely with 2 healers.
---
Well, you can estimate the cost, and you know exactly what you're getting. Is it worth it to you?
---
I try to stay away from vendors during farms as much as possible so for that scenario yes. If you don't then not really.
---
We had crashes on EB and Borderlands too in EU. People dc all over the place for no reason. The maps both EB and homborders are laggy as hell without reasons. And i dont talk about the normal lag that we had since forever. This is lag outside of the normal lag that was added with the new saga chapter.
---
A gw2 streamer I think it was MightyTeapot actually touched on this a couple of days ago. I don't wanna missquote him here but if I remember it correctly he mentioned a specific change in vision for the game as ANet switched to a more casual target audience. He was specifically referencing how the holy Trinity is quite easy as it tends to take the nuance (which the og GW2 combat system had) out of a game.
---
I found it to be better to have a couple of dedicated people to keep the torches up, like highly mobile Daredevils that can quickly go back to the middle. Trying to ignore the mechanics would make this super stressfull to your healers
---
Impossible to say if it is worth it for you. It was for me. But i have the materials and gold so i don't have to farm my ass off just to get them. If i had to do that for every one of those bags i would probably have less.
---
Are you talking about PvP? I have much fun with my interruptomancer in PvE, but I'm also not a powergamer.
---
Very expensive to craft, but I find mine worth it for sure. I don’t have to worry about my bag space running out as often, and there’s more room for opening multiple loot bags at a time
---
Would make a great Skimmer skin.
---
I left after like 20 pulls in pug - was curious to see what it was like.
---
Like I said, glad i did before nerf - never going to this again. lol
---
As others have stated, gearing up with agony resist and trying to conquer fractals is one part of the PvE endgame. The other part is doing raids. Have you even run fractals? As you go further along, it requires you (or your group if you're getting carried) to play better and better. And even after you've cleared 99cm+100cm, if you're good enough at the game you could even solo those. That's the beauty of this game and having a gear plateau so that player skill becomes a major factor in succeeding or failing. But even then, you need the agony resist so there's your gear progression/check there. Not a huge fan of the system tbh, but that's a story for another day. 
---
Running raids is the next step with added mechanics and of course, more things that could go right/wrong when you have 10 players. As some guilds have proven, you can complete raids in masterwork gear if you're good enough, but have you gotten to that point? Have ascended gear gives you that little edge over exotics to help you succeed, but your skill still matters more. 
---
MMOs often condition us to chase after some carrot and it's easy to forget that a game is about having fun. If you're enjoying things, then stick around and make goals for yourself. Like if you want to run fractals, make a post in LFG and it'll fill up quickly for dailies. If you're not having fun, then take a break and the game will always be there.

Hi, on the subject of the norn helm, is there a particular reason a beard is featured on said helm regardless of the gender wearing it?
---
It's a fun little fight with a good group, so props. But it has zero rewarding loot, and pugs will hate this one.
---
It's raids 2.0 - but less of it.
---

Another set of legendary armor? I feel strike missions would be a great spot to have a more accessible legendary armor for casual players. Maybe have it a much longer collection thats better done over time casually rather than grinded on. I just genuinely dont have the time at all for legendary envoy armor, as much as I want it, so that content is just locked off from me. Id love to raid but im very time constrained.
---
This is the real issue. Their is ZERO reason to do this more than one time.
---
Take tempest/scourge. Should be a lot easier.
---
I get exactly where you're coming from man, it's really hard for casual players to raid. They end up PUGing with other casuals, and the groups generally end up with no one who has actually done the raid. most have just watched some tutorial vid and decided to try it. It's also really hard if you don't have friends like myself. There are ways around it, though join in on a training discord or a raiding guild. Most if not all of them do training runs for people frequently, and if you already know what to do their much better pools to pull people from. I will say personally out of all the game raids I have done GW2 has my favorite ones I just wish they were easier to get a good group up for like doing fractals. Once you get into runs that can just sweep through a wing with only a wipe or 3 then you get hooked.
---
I really like the new changes! This difficulty level of 1) necessary mechanics but 2) no DPS check is a great balance!
---
That’s just what scruffy wants you to think. Everyone knows that Phlunt is just Taimi in a costume.
---
You don’t need multiple professions you need to max out multiple crafting disciplines. In my case, a norn warrior, uses heavy armor, i need, armorsmith (for ascended armor) and weaponsmith (for ascended weapons)
---
Trinkets are crafted with jewelcraft but you won’t need it. You can get ascended trinkets with laurels at any laurel merchant in every main city.
---
It is feasible to play one race most of the time, i do T4 fractals, and Im starting with raids. I do forsee that for higher level fractals i might need at least another profession leveled up to get higher chances to get into a good raid groups, i still have that level 80 boost sitting in my bank so, I don’t think it will be a big issue.
---
~~Jesus~~

---
If there's one thing the gw2 community loves more than shitting on every update, it's sucking off the EU community.
---
has been a while since i did the math, but to me they are worth it. for me personally the pre-PoF max bag limit of 160 slots still hits the sweet spot where i never need to worry about anything, so that is what i generally have in mind.
---
now to hit that limit pre-PoF you had to purchase 3 *soulbound* bag slots for 3 x 400 gems and 7 x 20 slot bags to fill them all. currently that would cost you ≈550g
---
however nowadays you can just fill the 5 default bag slots with 5 *accountbound* 32 slot bags which would set you back around 575g if the value of supreme runes of holding weren't so inflated thanks to the current episode.
---
in the end it all depends on what you intend to do, what you need, and how you value the potential tradeoffs.
---
Regular pugs who think it's too hard will simply skip it and wait for next week. More advanced players seem to be happy :) now if only it had some rewards to come with that difficulty...
---
Only worth if you already have max bag slots because you only gain 12 slots. A new bag slot + 20 slot bag is cheaper. Maybe the new one from Bjora Marches is cheaper because you need less runes.
---
They are useful(but not necessary) for identifying multiple stacks of gear bags and for setting up storage mules. 
---
Other than that, with the changes to loot drops (most everything is a gear bag) and build templates (besting able to store armor and weapon sets in templates and not in inventory),  large bags are a frivolous luxury IMO now.  I have alts that I run on who only use 18 slots bags and never come close to filling their inventory. 
---
When templates came out, I suddenly had a few 32 invisible bags that were mostly empty.   I would not consider making them unless you have a bunch of gold you're not doing anything else with.
---
I would have to disagree here, if it would be as simple as you said than this content would be as easy as Tequatl/Death Shatterer, etc. I do enjoy world bosses as well as various meta (Specimen Chamber comes to mind) in PoF and HoT and I assure you I do know how to dodge/cc/rez but apparently that is no even near enough to survive strike mission. Most probably it is just me *shrug*
---
Those who argue toxic casuals dont exist are toxoc casuals lul
---
That's why I never finished the HoT story. After I was almost done, and got glitched out, I didn't care to do it anymore.
---
Right?
---
Id actually do it the other way sound, the Base dmg in asc vs exo wars is noticable and asc trinkets are easy, so together you have enough for t2/t3 fracs and can get the armor for max AR and the high end T4 fracs bit by bit
---
Elitism - the advocacy or existence of an elite as a dominating element in a system or society. 
---
* the attitude or behavior of a person or group who regard themselves as belonging to an elite
---
Being an elitist is inheritely negative. Its a synonym for "pretentious."
---
This is one of the best suggestions I've heard. Strikes need their own unique currency but having better uncommon/rare rewards is a must also. Those runes have always annoyed me to hell cause the *ONLY* way to get them is to gamble. There is no earn them.
---
Engage in meaningless conversations in guild chats and maps, when someone find meaning in what you are saying, there you will have it, a new bff
---
Necros love to lose health on random environmental crap, so that way we aren't wasting half of our life stealing effects.
---
Im not saying they need to rework everything, I understand the undertaking that would be, or maybe I dont.   In any case, just adding a dungeon tab under dailies and giving a few reward chests would at least give them some life, I just hate seeing abandoned content like that.
---
You can't do that infinitely. I have a 32 slot bag in every possible spot, and I'd still get more if I could.
---
The point is that it's nowhere near double the development time.
---
Every power dps is welcomed in Cms+t4s. Ive seen one "no ele" yesterday and maybe 2 "no thief" in like the past year, but you should avoid those people no matter what class you play because i promise you they suck at the game :)
---
You have to admit at least that it’s not “double the development time.”  That’s absurd. 1.5x AT MOST depending on how HAM they go on it. They literally only would need to adjust damage output/boss health and/or maybe add an extra mechanic or adds for the “raid mode.” Added Mechanics don’t have to be super complex either to add difficulty to a strike to make it “complex enough and difficult enough” to be a raid boss.  Hell, I’ve heard NewSkinner likened to be approaching “Cairn and VG” In terms of difficulty, so it doesn’t sound too far off as it is (though I haven’t done it yet so hard for me to judge personally). 
---
Also as for your other concerns thematic raid rewards are largely re-used assets from boss fights/environment anyway (and should be to cut development costs).  W5 is a perfect example of many rewards done correctly, with Most of the weapon and armor skins (and bench) being re-used assets.  Rewards don’t have to be super plentiful either, especially if raids are released more frequently than the previous 9-10 month slow cadence. 
---
As for your last point, **raids don’t necessarily have to have a “side-story” storyline** or tons of cutscenes and voice acting. That’s some bullshit Anet pigeonholed themselves into for some reason to make “story only” fans happy (by separating main story from raids) since Anet was unwilling to add difficulties or smart design to raids/story when it first came out.  My point is **Raids can just be an extension/difficulty of the main story** like *many other smarter MMOs have done over the years.* Instead of doing the super logical thing and building content and assets that can be re-used with high replayability, Anet squandered resources building tons of set pieces, bosses, and mechanics that would never be used again, just sitting in LS/Expansion Storylines waiting to get thrashed on by any player with half a brain and some skill.  Obviously they’re trying to remedy this with Strikes by re-using assets and creating more replayable content (they’ve stated they’re aware of the problem and are doing this to help remedy it) but it doesn’t go far enough at the moment to create sustainable long lasting content, achieve their stated goals, or undo the years worth of mismanagement.
---
At least it was just easy for some shit rewards. Now you have to put some effort in for shit rewards.
---
&gt; I don't really understand the huge turnaround from the game being in a very rough spot to suddenly having 'Almost as good as expansion' patches?!
---
It's just the fanboys and the newer players saying that, especially the white knights from this reddit who ALWAYS over-praise everything ArenaNet does.
---
&gt;For example, getting upset that we haven't seen "expansion level" content yet when they stated the updates will be smaller but on a more frequent cadence and the expansion level content was meant as an "over time"
---
First impressions is one of the most important things.
---
Them saying this season would have expansion-level content and not delivering on either the Prologue nor Episode 1 \[plus making Ep 1 ridiculously short\] is not looking good.
---
You really cannot help being an ANet white knight even when you're clearly wrong.
---
Strike missions are, at best, a raid boss made far easier. That's not new at all.
---
Dude, you're talking to one of the known ANet bootlickers here, you waste your time trying to talk sense into him.
---
&gt; My point is Raids can just be an extension/difficulty of the main story
---
Raids can be anything, Fractals could be anything, Dungeons could be anything... Nobody is disputing that. But the reality is different.
---
The reality here is that we’ve had an established pattern when it came to raid **since 2015**. Just like you expect new Fractals to be short and scalable with the fractal difficulty system, you cannot expect Anet to do a turn-around and downgrade raids to the shadow of its formel self ‘for the sake of pushing a raid’. That’s exactly why we got strikes instead of raids.
---
As such, transitioning a boss fight into the system and prerequisites of a raid would be double development time because the strikes *and* the raids fulfill two different purposes. Just because both involve exotic boss fights doesn’t mean they can just copy paste most of it into one system or the other, that’s not how game development work.
---
If you want Unbreakable tools for the convenience, the glyphs on the Volatile ones are the best, the Volatile Magic they grant you can eventually recoup the cost of the tools.  It'll take quite a while if you're doing gold &gt; gems, though.
---
The primary reason to get unbreakable tools is for the convenience, never needing to buy gathering tools again.  If that's something that appeals to you, these are the best ones to buy.  If you don't mind having to carry a stock of them, or if you feel that swapping them between characters will be too annoying, then you might want to pass.
---
Small nitpick but heal herald is king of green numbers by a pretty wide margin. Tempest edges out scrapper as well thanks to being able to hit 10 with some Abilities.
---
Yeah you're definitely right dude, they should remove the rewards from fractals, because apparently 1% of the playerbase really loves doing Twilight Oasis over and over for fun!
---
The reason not to do it is to avoid splitting the playerbase - fractals are the "supported" 5-man instanced content so why would they push players towards dungeons?
---
Spoilers: they're going to stop caring, cause gold is only 1 rare unidentified.
---
131 gold for the 32 slot bag right now, not 180, assuming you're getting the new ones from Bjora Marches (and using buy orders for the runes).
---
Maybe instead of looking at the number of steps look at the actual difficulty and you will find weaver on the lower side of the spectrum dps wise
---
"Elite" that made me laugh so hard.....
---
I thought it was possible to solo all the story dungeons? I cant remember any mechanics that locked you out like the laser in CoE or do X actions in Y seconds
---
Wow. You're still talking...
---
So, your first excuse that "It doesn't have to be rage quitting to be rage quitting" didn't fly so now you're trying "If other people think you rage quit then you rage quit". That's still not rage quitting no matter how much you want it to be.
---
&gt;You were frustrated with the performance of your group and so you quit.
---
This is getting sad, *really sad*. You want so much for your assumption to be right that you're making me the star of your own "rage quit" fantasy. Now I was frustrated with their performance? *Thanks so much for telling me how I felt and how my own memories are lies* /s. 
---
&gt; And I certainly don't detect the least hint of anger
---
That's good cause if you did I'd say it was in your head but that would explain your "rage-quitting" assumption as the projection it is.
---
&gt;It's not like ragequitting is some major sin
---
Well that's good? I don't really care.
---
&gt;we all do it from time to time.
---
I don't, I'm the type of person that becomes more determined when they get angry and frustrated but you didn't know that because *you don't know me*.
---
&gt;But when you do, you should own up to it, not go "nu uh, I was embarrassed, it's totally different"
---
I don't have a problem telling the truth but you *clearly* have a problem accepting. When are *you* going to own up to the fact that **you don't know me or the situation** well enough to tell *me* what I did and why I did it? C'mon dude, own it. I don't think you will but I'm hoping you prove me wrong.
---
Its ok some people can't read their own comments, not everyone is able to dodge and thats ok. For you see there a few types of people in this world. Evolved mammals such as ourselves and then you have the mindless bonobos such as Kiroho here that most likely plays water camp staff tempest with full clerics on largos and thins he's "helping".
---
&gt; "Mostly filled with pugs"
---
&gt; 8/10 people above 10k DPS, 4 people at 20k in the first pull
---
&gt; 4/10 people above 10k DPS, one player above 20k perfect three-healer raid comp in the second pull.
---
I think that people really, really, REALLY don't understand what a player who is "new to raiding" actually looks like. This isn't a stepping stone to raids, now, it's just a new raid boss. Which is fine, and I'm glad people are enjoying the challenge, but groups of *actual* new players can't reliably get close to healing through this much damage or killing this boss.
---
So I bought the original tools (cheap ones) and have enjoyed not having to buy the tools any more, but now that I have read up on getting the trophy shipments to help with gold and T6 mats I'm always carrying around the Karama bought ones now.  So just not sure if it was worth it, or if buying the glyph was more economical.  2700 gems is a lot considering skyscale mount skins, or a whole pack of themed mount skins are 2000 gems.
---
Because they exist, and they are fun, but no one does them... Because its hard to find groups to do them.. Because they dont offer much relevant to the current game..which they should.
---
I’m not that much of a fan of the loot table for these, but saying it’s just “one rare” in this case is just not accurate.
---
Your bone skin is what? 😳
---
Damnit ! I was procrastinating on completing it thinking “it’ll be easy” lol. Ah well, good on a net for listening.

---
Man I miss 10 man scourge clears with epi bounce
---
PM me your in game name and/or discord then we can be friends. xD
---
I'm serious tho.
---
You want to know the secret to why that's the case? Because there is no challenge in MMOs and your rose-tinted glasses need to come off for a minute. Bosses are either literally unkillable, or they seem that way until everyone stops being braindead 2 weeks later. Then, people either stop playing till the next experience comes along, or they have a carrot to chase.
---
If "challenge" was real and enjoyable for an MMO experience, WildStar wouldn't be dead, WoW Classic would have people still trying to world first the raid, and people wouldn't have killed so-called unkillable bosses in all the "hard" MMOs, like Final Fantasy 11.
---
The issue is that MMOs have failed to grow out of the gameplay from 2004, and there's never a real new experience besides shinies, enemies, and story.
---
What you describe is a design issue that plagues every themepark MMO.
---
10 bank tabs costs 6000 gems, which is around 2,362g.   Crafting 10 bags costs 1912g.  This is of course assuming you'd have all 10 bag slots, but in terms of 32 slot bag value.. it's still better than buying 10 bank tabs.
---
And the fact that their price went up by like 40% didn't really help either. Crafting the new bags might actually be more expensive than crafting the older ones before the update. It will probably go down after a while but it really doesn't encourage you to craft them right now.
---
Yeah, should have mentioned that Heal Scrapper is 5 man only more or less.
---
And I completely forgot revenant could heal lol, my bad.
---
Yeah seriously this ^. Friendly loot share from anet changed the gaming industry in more ways than we could have thought
---
I think I was lucky enough to run into an Emi train when I first started playing earlier this year. HP train so not as exhaustive , but still an invaluable experience for a new player. I still save the email of kind works when it was over.  [NA server].   Still feeling grateful!
---
Yes, that's very [helpful](https://i.imgur.com/uGHiqOJ.png).
---
HA! I knew you wouldn't own it! Instead, you double down. How predictable. I've seen way better trolling, you need to work on your game. 6 years on reddit and this is the best you can do? Sad.
---
Why is it even there?!?!?! the fight is in it's final phase, and there is just a random exit portal sitting there.
---
I think this is a really great suggestion.
---
I also suggested this same aesthetic. My other idea would be a torch offhand and the f skills set up a camp. It would be more support oriented and make better use of the revealed mechanic with risk-reward gameplay. Lighting campfires which nullify stealth even for the thief but Grant other bonuses as an offset.
---
My main hope is that the next elite gives a one handed weapon because so far both elites have given 2 handed meaning they haven't taken advantage of the dual weapon skill mecha if already built in to the class. A one handed weapon would add just as ma y skills but offer more build options across the board.
---
Like many thinkgs I'm pretty sure they didn't thought about that creating gw2 and now it would need a complete rework, and they already struggle with other things so ...
---
You gotta be joking.
---
You should be able to get away with salvaging them all.  Check the Trading Post, there shouldn't be any green weapons from level 76-80 that are worth more than 3 silver or so.  There's no sense in wasting inventory/bank space to hold onto items that you can so easily buy again should you want them.
---
By the time you get to max level, you'll be wanting to buy rare or exotic (yellow or orange) weapons anyway.  Their power is sizably higher, and they should still be affordable, with rares being between 20-40 silver depending on weapon type and most exotics being available for under 2 gold.
---
My 2 cents:
---
When the encounter is over each player is presented with a window that displays their personal DPS, Healing, and whatever else that's appropriate, as a percentile of the all players who have completed the encounter. Therefore, to be 100% on dps is to deal the most damage that anyone has dealt EVER. As this information is not displayed to the squad, players are motivated to improve without risking being ostracized.

I have played since launch consistently (1 of each class) and only have 18 slot bags on my characters without any extra bag slots either. I estimate for the average person, the gold-value ratio is best at that level. Ofc as everyone else has said, you have to decide if it's worth it to you. If your diligent about keeping your bags as clean as possible I recommend my way.
---
The first time I saw Primordus, I was like fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck me.
---
Welcome to GW2 where everything has to cater till the lowest common denominator till the content starts dropping off before they stop developing it. Strikes are the only thing trending the other way around. Instead of things becoming easier and easier (like raids, open world) or going back on great design decisions in the name of variety (fractals) then in both cases people stop playing. Now the mode is getting harder, seems like an actual good trend for once.
---
Some people don't even know about crafting, others simply aren't into leveling those professions. For those, Eitrite Ingots are wasted. Though those people probably won't be into Strike Missions anyway...
---
Also, demand for Restored Boreal weapons is certainly dropping. There's still some for the achievements, but the price drop is already reflecting that. Don't know if people will still buy in the future, like Primordus weapons.
---
IIRC, a dev had mentioned once that the character select screen in GW1 is actually a map chunk designed specifically for that purpose with the forced camera perspective.
---
Yes, but the price of the runes of holding went up since the release of this episode. I just said that if you crafted the old bags before the update hit it might actually have been cheaper than crafting the new bags now. The market basically adjusted itself on its own as if nothing has changed except that you now also need account bound materials.
---
It will probably go down a bit over time as the inital "hype" passes but crafting them right now is pretty bad if you buy the runes from the TP.
---
This is my problem with it and why I probably won't even bother. Why do it?
---
Ignoring the mechanics will be pretty tough on the squad. Maybe a comp with 2 healbrands and an tempest could outheal, but I'm not sure, haven't done it enough times to know.
---
Of course. Why would I bother doing it otherwise?
---
The trick is to accept gw2 for what it is and disregard all of it's potential.
---
And not make them 0.005% drop rate like the ebon shoulders. 10% is good.

Yuuuuppppp...  Spend 45 minutes getting a group to do challenge mode in 2019—get launched out of instance, not get achieve done. Classic HoT.

That's because most of the people commenting are kids on high school or whatever and have the spare time.

I used to be a hardcore gamer too, back when I wasn't working 12 hour days.
---
Most toxic players are very far from being “elite” (or even good really)...  They’re right at that level where they know enough to blame people worse then them, but often fail execution themselves and are looking for scapegoats to dump out frustration on. 
---
Good players don’t fail things or wipe enough in general where wiping in a pug would get them triggered.  (Especially low stakes stuff like Strike Missions.)
---
Yeah. I mean, why the hell do I have to complete the core map with over 300 hearts for gift of exploration? Talking about boring...
---
I am not sure i understand.
---
That dragon was supposed to be Jormag itself at first, I was very disappointed when they changed it.
---
it was supposed to be Jormag at first, but they decided to change it.
---
lol nice
---
speak for yourself c:
---
That definitely has not been my experience. I have been playing since pre-release, and though the "no trinity" was a nice concept, and they have at least partially held to that mantra, it wasn't very nice in the beginning.  Running the more challenging dungeons was a complete mess, and people complained about it constantly. It was precisely as you say - a bunch of people running around spamming their dps rotations, without caring at all about their fellow players.  
---
The balance that I think Anet has achieved over the years it to diversify group composition in their own way. The introduction of healers (and arguably more support classes) has opened the door to a lot more diversity and options for players to customize thier characters and play experience.
---
OK! Anet developers pay attention please! I owe you an apology! I came here yesterday ranting about how it is not a bug but a useless strike missión. Sorry, now it is a good ramp-up for Raids in my eyes too! Kudos!

Impressive, respect to your healers; I certaintly dont envy them with that much downed states flying around
---
Nope, that's impossible. We know Jormag drove the Norn south from much further north in the Shiverpeaks. That would mean that the Norn had to flee *through* Jormag, not away from it. Jormag probably slept in a location much further north we've yet to visit in either game.
---
100% every area I go into
---
Are you also gathering as you go, killing ambient creatures, crafting, doing story missions, doing dynamic event chains, WvW and PvP, doing jumping puzzles and mini dungeons?
---
Check out gw2style.com for people's armor combinations. A so for piece can look underwhelming. Heck, so can a matching set. You'll be surprised how good you can look when you mix items and color combinations
---
Whats the best way to use 2k gems for a newbie? Really want the infinite tools and salvage machine.
---
Don't force yourself so do a map 100% you don't need to do that, go where you think is something interesting, explore freely and don't just follow markers on the map :)
---
signet alone shouldn't push it to 29.5k, especially since you'd overcap  condition duration with the old gear
---
could you post a log?
---
If you're upgrading an existing bag slot from a 20-slot bag to 32-slot, that will cost you ~138.8g for 12 additional inventory slots -- that's 11.57g per item slot.
---
If you haven't already maxed out your bag slots on a character, however, you can trade 149.8g for 400 gems and buy an additional bag slot. Then buy three Candy Corn Cobs for 9g total and trade them for a 20-slot Halloween Pail. That adds up to 158.8g for 20 inventory slots -- 7.94g per slot.
---
Prices can and will change, but that's the basic breakdown at this point in time.
---
But you can't hold empty bag slots as the baseline, unless you're talking about making a *mule* and equipping it with 32 slot bags. 
---
If you're counting 20-slot bags as the baseline, getting ten 32-slots is an increase of only 120 slots, which is equal to *4* bank tabs.
---
If you *are* talking about a mule, then you have to add the 3600 gems cost of the character slot and the 5 bag slots.
---
Ah yes, if you can do world bosses you most certainly know how to dodge, cc, res, ...
---
:)) strike missions are too hard, definitely too much effort to learn for casual players. I mean learning anything is no fun at all!
---
To be fair if you have 2-3 supportive roles the same can be done on some raid bosses.
---
I think there’s also a random drop or two? But yes, I guess they are seeing the ingots as a sort of token. I think that’s a mistake - they should have just made a saga wide strike token.
---
You only need 100% completion to craft legendary weapons, but they are stat wise them same as ascended weapons, so no you don't need to :)

I mean a lot of the traditional comps thought to be unbeatable have been destroyed by new, innovative comps (eg core guard MO, firebrand matt). The meta isn't that stale.

I guess they definitely are unique in that sense. It would be interesting to see a minion centered elite spec. Though, you should check out this idea for the next necro elite spec, as well as my comments on it. I thought it was quite brilliant.

It would be way easier if you had real healer and not a druid. Imagine having heal necro or tempest, those downstates for minutes would be 2 seconds instead, or wouldn't be at all.

Is this what has been causing entire teams to crash in PvP? With the latest patch, in my ranked games I will have 5 people disconnect simultaneously from some crash glitch.

me and a handful of randoms tried to do this on EU before and got hounded by people taxing in to do meta, just a heads up, they can be a bit toxic. good luck with runs!
---
I think your definition of "elitist" lines up more with the definition that I've heard for elite or hardcore players.
---
"Elitist," at least in my experience, means more along the line of people that believe that they and/or their group are superior to others for whatever reason, and/or those that are jerks to those who don't play their way or live up to their unreasonably high standards (that they themselves don't necessarily have to live up to). So basically, snobs and pretentious jerks, the guys who say that you don't know how to play GW2 if you don't know how to use your class in raids/T4 fractals/competitive modes, that you should just quit playing altogether. The ones that yell at you in squad chat if you're not putting out high enough dps or if you get downed once or twice (even though they're probably getting even less dps, or at least less than all but the lowest player, and probably dying just as much)
---
I should be clear, elite/hardcore players are not necessarily elitists (I'd wager most aren't), and elitists (the extremist version of hardcore players) aren't much better or worse than the extremist casual players (which I don't have a fancy name for except I guess also jerks/snobs/etc.), the ones who say that hardcore players shouldn't play GW2 and that their complaints aren't valid.
---
Wish I had tried it before the buff.  I don't have time or patience to try over and over again with pugs
---
She must be some immortal entity which never sleeps
---
I never said thar you were standing in them but ok.
---
I've levelled 50 characters now, and I can tell you that you're almost certainly NOT going to use those weapons at that level. Stuff you can buy for a few silver will fill any gear gaps if you really fall behind and need them filled, whilst at 80 you'll be looking for better gear anyway. Salvage them (or sell them on the BLTC if they're worth more than about 5s) and free up the inventory space.
---
You can 2shot yellow mobs and just chain kill your way through some zones. It's super easy.
---
Hello, did you expect squads to just take 3 healers and DPS it down for gold quickly?
---
Ah so that's why Fractals are doing so great and being frequently released.
---
Who have time to see how flashy and good looking you are in PvP anyway? XD
---
That...would actually be pretty sweet if done well. GW2 right now does a terrible job of teaching its mechanics and concepts/strategies. It certainly doesn't help that the gear people get from the level 80 boost/preview is something like knight's or soldier's, iirc, so they're led to believe that that's the sort of stat set they should use. But even disregarding that, there's obviously no cc tutorial, among others. If the achievements had good enough hints or pointed you towards some NPC that would help explain each mechanic/concept (maybe even made you talk to them as a first step).
---
Also, some simple yet clearly visible way of telling if someone gets the basics like a title is a really good idea (although it might cause problems for those who haven't yet done the achievements, or from those who got the title but are still just as clueless).
---
I found the pov of the scourge here if anyone is interested, lol.

To be clear, the image that was linked was posted by someone else a few days ago and was completely unrelated to anything to do with dungeons (Gaile Gray hasn't been the "ArenaNet Support Liason" for a long time), but yeah, that attitude is completely ridiculous, and the added smiley at the end of the suppression of criticism is insulting at best.
---
It's genuinely funny how straight-faced you pick exactly the one example that actually has a high-effort system of different tiers of difficulty, and still don't notice the pattern.
---
P/P 3 says hellogoodbye
---
Ah no worries thanks for replying :)
---
It's important to try things out when you're leveling, so you become familiar with the class. Especially classes like Engineer, who have a bajillion different skills. That said, if you're gonna boost, boost the thief or the necro. Both have dead simple endgame, and largely a single way to play them. Even their elite specs are pretty straightforward.
---
Is it inheritely negative in a moral sense.
---
In a true meritocracy the elite are the more capable once. So being the dominating element in that system would make sense.
---
Haha, that looks very similar to my gameplay. Getting downed all the time, again, again, again and again until death. My character even got downed few times before Boneskinner fix. Dodging does not work, dodge one AoE into another AoE, dodge again, out of dodges, into third AoE and die. Ressing also is really dangerous, there is like 90% chance my character gets downed while ressing someone.
---
And can i have a lvl1 char do that or it has to be 80?
---
Those floating damage numbers look quite big to me? Actually somewhat similar what my character does. And I do raids!
---
Wait for it: He also runs Signet of the Locust xD
---
So were you.
---
And you did hint towards the idea that doing well against wsr is a sign of being healthy rather than close to doomed. 
---
It's a sign of being stacked, and not even a little bit. And yet you're recruiting on reddit...
---
There was too many categories so they got replaced.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/92410/game-update-notes-november-19-2019
---
i'm about helping full newbies here mainly; teaching new players the basics and worst case just help them getting warkitty, best case making them interested in the format is the only goal i have with this post.
---
and if you look at our server history, Desolation was like always pretty good. only few links messed that up, but i did not play actively in that period for personal reasons. 
---
i don't mind the bandwagoners, but i totally understand what u mean. that IS what i meant with "unorganized". at least 50% of our current tags are spontanous tag ups or people who try tag'ing up for the first time etc, and nobody follows them. this is uncoordinated. they rather roam and jump alone into 7-8 people groups at hbl bay, while they could gather up at a tag, stay around him, borderhop and get their bags. a group of 15-20 people is always more effective than the single 4-6 ppl groups, and any tag keeps them together.  
---
also THAT is a problem of the format, the system. there should be rewards for beeing t1, not "stuck". because tanking would annoy a big amount of people for several weeks, we had that yet.
---
Getting frustrated at video games. 😩
---
I don't like fractals. Dungeons are much more fun!
---
HAHAHAHAHAH WHAT. Sorry, who are you again?
---
I believe it is from the adds being veterans at 75% health you get the special action.
---
Bring it back with the ability to turn off visual effects from trinkets!
---
You think recruiting to what is currently at least a top two most stacked server is healthy? You think itll make wvw better? You think itll make deso or bt better?
---
You think you'll be training noobs to keep up with the veterans of your server? fighting the only opposition they have in wsr, rather than doing this on any other server where both fellow players and opposition are closer to the level of those players?
---
Small scale roaming on one of the most over stacked links in EU. 
---
RIP deso was the PG13 way of saying you're a complete pepega and recruiting, especially on reddit, for a #1 stacked server isnt a bright thing to do.
---
No? 3,5k-5k crits every 2-5 seconds, many random lower critical hits and those absolutely massive 30k-40k hits (??), like in the video. Anyway, most important thing is that the boss dies.
---
A full Non-fractal set of trinkets with only 1 char should take around 17-20 days (1200 berrys, 2x rings at 200 and 2x Earrings at 400 ea; jade shards take less, 1200 berrys/70 per day = 17 days + 3 if you need unbound magic)
---
With 2 chars (i do the same) Half the time obviously.
---
If you do your Fractal set it might take longer in days or be more Daily playtime bc you need to do ember bay and Draconis mons too.
---
Everytime I see this screen, I'm getting mad. I can't help it, it's just infuriating to have someone in a videogame company saying this.
---
That's still 15x less than the benchmark numbers and at least 7x less than what an above average dps build with decent group composition does.
---
*"Good afternoon, gentlemen. I am a personal armoured transportation golem designation Scruffy. I became operational at the Synergetics lab in Rata Sum in 1324 AE. My instructor was Taimi, and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd like to hear it I can sing it for you."*
---
False. Did him this Halloween for the first time with other first timers and it was piss easy.
---
Yeah it would be great to give 3 random paths each day for a few gold or something.
---
&gt; and those absolutely massive 30k-40k hits (??)
---
These are the mastery lasers with the Special Action Key. I believe the damage is the same whether you're full ascended or naked.
---
anyone remember the restriction on template swap speed on arc templates?
---
If you have the LS Episodes you can start. A tip to get a 2nd character up to 80 more quickly: Play wvw and pvp, atleast for the dailies. You'll get tomes of knowledge quickly. And if you want to Level a crafting profession, do it on the leveling charakter, gives a few levels aswell.
---
GW2 is a wasteland of wasted potential :(.
---
By the way, bring back monthlies (or turn them into weeklies).
---
Yeah, this is incredibly easy to do, I wonder why you can't just swap the direction in the character creation itself in the first place.
---
&gt; Im... Genuinely having a hard time seeing why you're being downvoted.
---
Maybe some elitists that don't want to be mixed up with casuals. Or the other way round. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Unrelated, but I wish hairstyles were turned into helm skins and added into the wardrobe. Then ArenaNet could sell individual hairstyles in the gem store, and people would be able to swap hairs easily.
---
I'd rather be able to skip selection screen altogether, and instead be able to switch between characters dynamically without going through it.
---
you run out of catch phrases pretty fast, come on you've gone from funny to boring.
---
Yeah yeah, sure sure, go troll somewhere else, kiddo.
---
Monthlies were just repetitive grind achievements, and with weeklies there would be no time to have varied things unless they were limited to specific objectives, in which case they'll be basically dailies.
---
I'd go in the opposite direction, and make them Quarterly or 3 times a year, so there's much more time to complete them, and the objectives can be much more long term, like completing every dungeon path, or every fractal level.
---
Honestly that's what I was thinking of when it comes to this new system, I think it's nice to have an already smaller community bunch up a bit in maps that aren't really favored, as well it seems like it makes doing dailies a bit less of a chore with less hopping between maps, but as well the option of building up currency in one area would be nice, especially if you're working on legendaries. I preferred the smaller, but more consistent boosts on the day to day rather than hoping the map you need comes up.
---
Would be nice to at least be able to dye the banners of the WvW backpack. The other two are kinda hard since they don't have plain colors, but they could still offer alternate skins using different colors. In fact, they should do that for legendary weapons as well, where you have the base version, and two alternate recolors (for example, green and blue fire predator).
---
Under 40g if you farm everything or have the material. If not you would get around 20+++ days of time gate.
---
It's the classic build for fashion wars.
---
Yeah. That's what I'm always saying too.
---
One of the things that bothers me about the Victory or Death story chapter is how many people get there without ever playing the dungeons and learning about Destiny's Edge, or after orgetting about them.
---
So I would also prefer if the story paths were actually part of the Personal story, and received the same treatment as Arah story. 
---
During the story, characters receive mail updates from their friends in destiny's edge, but that can't compare to playing the paths. 
---
The times at which those mails are received would be the perfect points to insert the remaining dungeon stories within the Personal story. 
---
It could be also a good time to make the Explorable paths account-wide unlocks too so players only need to play the story once to have the explorable modes unlocked for all characters. 
---
Even better, since there's 25 explorable paths, it could be possible to make the fractal gate a hub point to them all, using the same interface as fractals since that panel has 26 entries.  
---
Players could walk to the fractal gate as usual, and they would get the fractal panel as usual, but there would be a new button to switch to a new Fractal Dungeons tab. There, filling the 26 slots in the lists, players could find all existing 25 explorable paths, plus an 26th entry to go to a random one. 
---
Better still,  the 25 explorable paths visited from the fractal gate could also get 4 tiers of difficulty set in a similar way to fractal difficulties, with instabilities and the like. With T1 difficulty being easier than the current dungeon difficulty, while T3 and T4 being slightly harder.   
---
Then, fractal dungeons would give fractal relics, plus dungeon tokens instead pristine relics, and the dungeon vendor could get new items that can be purchased with those currencies, gold, and maybe other currencies like karma and matrices, depending on the item. Examples of possible 'new' dungeon rewards could be:
---
* Ascended gear with dungeon skins.
---
* Recipes to make novelty versions of dungeon tonics. 
---
* A few new skins, like: 
---
 * Breathers skin versions of dungeon headgear like the Sorrow's Embrace helmets. 
---
 * Actually visible [spine guards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Back_item#Loot "spine guards"). 
---
 * Restored Orrian weapons, that look how they would have looked before they spent ages underwater. 
---
* Items with alternate versions of dungeon skins, or recipes to craft them out of the original items, like:
---
 *  Day-only and night-only versions of Ascalonian weapons.
---
 * Ghostly ascalonian armor with a dyeable ghostly glow. 
---
 * Clean and polished versions of the council ministry armors. 
---
 * Actually golden golden wing weapons.
---
 * Aetherized nightmare court armors with dyable aether effects. 
---
 * Glowing yellow nightmare weapons, since we already have magenta and cyan weapons. 
---
 * Overloaded forgeman armor with glowing eyes and flames coming off the glowing parts. 
---
 * Green glyphic/dark asuran weapons, as we have red and blue already. 
---
 * Flame legion armor with dyeable flames. 
---
 * Ignited flame legion weapons with flames and smoke coming off them. 
---
 * Kodan weapons that do not have ice. 
---
 * Icy Kodan armor.
---
 * Charged inquest armor with glowing neon edges and moving parts like ticking gears.
---
 *  Green inquest weapons since we already have blue and red inquest/mystic forge weapons.
---
 *  Purified Dragon's Deep weapons. Softened, rounder, white and gold. Without spikes and faces, so they no longer look like they are possessed by a demon.
---
 * Purified orr armor, that look what they may have looked before their wearers became risen, without bones, claws and spikes and the like.
---
You should keep them until you're looking at alt #9 and saying, "Oh gahd! I don't want to do Claw Island again!"
---
This is a controversial opinion on this subreddit, but if you really feel this way about leveling, and you own (or want to buy) the expansions, just use the level 80 booster. The leveling process is dated and doesn't click with everyone, and most people will agree that expansion content is superior and much more fun. However, it's also more difficult, so be prepared to get acclimated quickly if you choose to skip the leveling "tutorial."
---
Want something new? Okay, let's play "Block the troll-kiddi". I'm starting.
---
You are blocked, kiddi.
---
Monthlies at least made me try new things and play the game. Daily login rewards don't.
---
I understand for players that played wvw for years that zergs an blobs are more fun than roaming but i think new players would have more fun if they were in a 2-5 man group and roam the map
---
That's the definition of extraterrestrial, not alien.
---
Only thing to watch out for is having the recommended agony resist and that only starts to become a thing at level 20+ scaling from 8 all the way up to 150 at level 100.
---
Why would you buy Mac though... that's probably one of the worst choices on market...
---
Anyways, as you have your device fresh, you sure should check all the drivers, OS version, update them when needed, and such. You just bought it, but the computer was probably for weeks on shop storage and so it is very good idea to make sure all of this is up to date.
---
Rev probably
---
I don't even care if the lesser versions that we build up to become dyeable (though that would be amazing too), but the top tier actually legendary version (and the glider version) should get retrofitted to be dyeable.
---
Go for hp training
---
Since you said it's new but the 2018 line, make sure the drivers are up to date. Check in your graphics settings whether it's correctly using the dedicated GPU or the onboard one. And while you're at it, make sure the airflow isn't blocked (the flickering happens most notably on overheating), and keep tabs on your temperatures (there's a few apps for that, though I'm not sure what's installed by default). 
---
Lastly, make sure you're playing the 64-bit client, and always let it download fully; even when it claims to be "playable", it often hasn't loaded all textures yet. 
---
Good luck!
---
Anything...people will complain and cry about literally...anything.
---
I have a full set of Assassins Exotic level 80.
---
If you haven't maxed out the trait line you are using you will not get any benefit. A level 80 thief would have access to full theif trait lines.
---
They add more than daily login rewards that's for sure.
---
Haven't had a reason to do a jp in half a decade, at least monthlies made go do stuff and feel rewarded.
---
That's good. Trinkets too?
---
&gt; I went back to that 76 zone and I am hitting for less damage.
---
The reason is not your level.
---
Possible reasons include:
---
&gt; turned deadeye
---
This likely changed your traits, likely changing damage/whatever modifiers.
---
&gt; full assassins set
---
What did you have before? Assassins prefers precision over power. This could lower your overall damage, but there are lots of other factors this would depend on, of which just one would be ... 
---
... using the same runes as before?
---
Hero point or "hp train" and snag a trait build from the 'open world' section of [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Thief](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Thief) if you wanna. You'll find hp train groups in the lfg tool in heart of thorn and pof map sections. I'm sure a guildie or someone in map chat will help you out with further questions about that. Pretty common and casual.
---
&gt;what am I doing wrong?
---
&gt;acquiring the first few points in deadeye.
---
answered your own question.
---
So you count everyone who uses reddit as player base. What about people who are not using reddit. Like who are ingame actually? My guild mates for example. Am not the only one. Not everyone is happy.
---
Also what about guy above me who you called trolly kiddi and blocked him. 
---
So basically with you who ever does not agree and offers criticism is wrong and makes mistake because this game is perfect asf.
---
While I think this definitely applies to a lot of what Anet does, in the case of dungeons it's more like them making brownie flavour, but it's more expensive and less popular and they no longer make chocolate flavour.
---
50% is triple, right..

I see, thanks for the I put. I'll get more HP to Max it out.

If you swapped out a damage oriented trait line for Deadeye you're most likely missing out on a lot of damage modifiers since you haven't unlocked all traits for DE yet. 
---
Deadeye also relies highly on marking a target with Deadeye's Mark (your F1 ability) building Malice stacks (orbs above your Endurance bar) with abilities that cost Initiative, going into Stealth, and using your AA attack while stealthed to consume those Malice stacks for a high hitting burst attack. Basically Deadeye has to build up its damage before it can go nuts.
---
A lot of your damage is going to depend on your traits - which line did you swap out for Deadeye?
---
Also, full Assassin's gear will have a lot of wasted stats, which will lower your damage.
---
Go back to the normal thief, only use Deadeye once you got all the Hero Points to unlock it fully. If you go to the Heart of Thorns or Path of Fire maps, you will get 10 points per Hero Point on the map. This means you should be able to unlock Deadeye within 1 - 2 hours. Even faster, if you find a "HP train" (usually done in Verdant Brink and Auric Basin, check the LFG)

IMO Greatsword skins are criminally overpowered in terms of fashionwars. Only way to balance this is by giving every profession a greatsword build!
---
&gt; IDK why he is comparing it to bank tabs. Doesn't make sense.
---
Comparing because there are far worse things to buy to make room for more space than 32 slot bags.  While they aren't the best investment, there is still worse.
---
And the daunting 10k AP at 10 AP per day hunt is just not worth the time effort
---
Whats a dungeon?
---
Hi, have you copy paste the code? When you did this, than you have to reenter the last digit and you should be good to go.
---
use the booster and ignore the morons saying leveling teaches you anything worthwhile
---
Oh wow so you can read my comments just not yours huh. Im glad to know your reading comprehension or lack thereof is only one sided. Hopefully one day you'll get your GED and learn how to read both ways.
---
IDK how having a whole bunch of extra bank space is worse, but ok.
---
Price wise on which one costs more.
---
You're talking about pretty much all raid type content in most MMOs. The only boss mechanism I've seen in this game that changes is the one used for bounties and now the 5 bosses after the meta in Bjora. Personally, I find the bounty stuff to not only be stale and tired but haphazard and ugly.
---
Why would you assume in your first post that I havent tried giving a proper feedback to certain players back in the days? Why would you assume that only result would be a positive one? You are painting a one sided picture when the reality is far from it. Hence why I'm taking a piss at us all.
---
Dont you try to act cool and throw some shitty meme "assumption" crap at me when you cant even contain yourself. Everything you said in the first post was some bollox based on your personal assumptions far from being critical, realistic and neutral. You are seriously not the one to moralize here so better keep walking.
---
on golem yes, but in actual raids lich runes might pull ahead if the minion gets some boons or whatever
---
where do you want to redeeme your code?
---
I had something similar happen to me when I bought a gem card from in store.. like it took a day or so to fully activate.  I would try again after a day.. if it still doesn't work maybe contact anet support and ask?
---
Their EU server manager man?
---
I blame them for epi nerf :(
---
You bought it off of Amazon?
---
Was it an *actual* retailer offered through Amazon or another individual/party that sold you these? Most online codes are just that - online and the mentioning of "send it back" makes me ask if it you bought physical copies off of one or the other?
---
you're suggesting they work on old content, haha good one.
---
Thanks for this! I will try to unlock the rest this weekend.
---
Yea. I get that doing that for all backpiece items might be too much manpower/hours compared to what they have now, but as OP stated, at least do it for the legendary ones.
---
Just one additional note...
---
If you go to lower level zone, you will be downscaled so you are on par with the zone. So don't make your measurements in non80 map, as that affects it. Don't know if 80 downscaled to 76 is same as 76.... though, usually the downscaled character is stronger anyways because better gear and more traits unlocked (downscaling is -% of all stats, basically).
---
Chrono never had to work with the druid. None of their abilties remotely interact.
---
Yes at the black lion company page ingame. 
---
Additionally I cant buy gems ingame. Just shows "There was a failure" and it goes back to the start.
---
Only in the very, very early stages.
---
My worry based off of the concept art for the two so far, is that they'll say the creature beneath Drakkar Lake was Jormag, and that Drakkar is the ice column statue. Not only would this retcon lore, but would negate why it's called Drakkar (after the lake).
---
Any reviving skill would work. It's fun when you manage to revive plot-killed NPCs before they vanish.
---
It looks much larger than tequatl
---
I'm curious, I've heard people mention this, I have the 3 sets and can't really see a bug, I've also seen people request a 4th slot. What is the bug exactly?
---
Misinterpretation from someone who has a stow weapon button bound to cancel aftercasts.
---
Yes, that's my bad - 120. Still much less than 300.  
---
Why you comparing it to 0? Fractal bags are super easy to get, it would cost you only 90 silver + a bit of fractal relics. 20 slots bags are kinda default in this case. That's why this comparison just seems illogical to me.  
---
Anyway, do whatever you think is right for you and I will do it my way. :D
---
I quit the second outfits had better dye options than legendary armor.
---
Oh didn't know the cape came with level 80 ascended stats, infusion slots, and a glider. Must have missed it when i bought it.
---
2 of the deadeye grandmaster traits should allow you to have permafury. With Signet of Agility, Sigil of Accuracy and the Critical Strikes line, full exotic assassin gear will overcap by 6.8%.
---
I go from around 2k in healing output to 5.5k by taking Lingering Light  according to ArcDPS as you can also swap around your CA rotation as you no longer need CA5 for the might stacks it gives so yes, according to my statistics it nearly tripled my output as I'm rocking my CA much different.
---
Having any new elite specs at all would be an idea....
---
Cynicism aside, I like your idea. Mace/black jack been suggested before and would thematically fit very well for a thief elite spec.
---
It’s not like lvl 80 ascended back pieces are hard to get. What’s the point? I find it easier having a second ascended set than it is to swap stats and sigils/stat-infusions on legendary.
---
Please.  I just want my ascension to not have gold.  I can never match it with my wardrobe.
---
Having to log on some other account is too much effort for such a lazy person like me lol.
---
I have created an alt account for weekly raiding (extra gold), but I just cba, wanna stick to my main acc. That's too much effort for me.
---
Dungeons were just as, if not more, popular than fractals before HoT dropped.
---
Ok so you seem to have got a bit of mixed info or missunderstood what it is about. 
---
So mapcompletion and in the end world completion is something that you have to do if you want to make first generation legendary weapons. Legendary weapons usually have a nice look and can be statswapped out of combat. They are not the bis weapon because they have the same stats as ascended weapons so if you don't want to make a legendary weapon that is totally fine too. 
---
You can ofc make mapcompletion if you enjoy doing it, but you can also just not do it or make it later when you are lvl 80 and got your mounts and are more aware of what you need and want in the game.
---
So to level up do things you enjoy. There are more the mapcompletions. Do the story it give you loots and xp and buffs and keys. Do events, infact events should be the mainthing. If you pass them do them. World bosses, we have loads of those in the core game.  This timer will show you were and when http://gw2timer.com/
---
Special events such at the Invasion, Leyline anomaly, crazed beast and so on give lots of xp. 
---
Some maps have meta events like the Harathi Hinterlands and the centaurs. Loads of xp to get on that map if you follow the events which leads to a world boss in the end and then restarts.
---
Crafting and gathering give xp. Get your tools and gather everything you get and craft stuff you need and level that up too.
---
Story dungeons starts at lvl 30 and there are more of them the higher level you get. 
---
Swap maps, don't get stuck on a map. If you open up your map you can reach every race starting area and go from there. Exploration give you xp so get out in the world and enjoy it.
---
Soon the Wintersday even will start in Divinitys Reach and will have lots of fun things to do. Just enter the portals around the the candy icons and enjoy the fun.
---
Never heard the cape argument, source?
---
Genuinely trying to understand why they wouldn’t think capes were possible.
---
GW2 style is not photorealistic, so slight body/facial features disproportions is just a sign of stylization in my eyes. Think about disney characters, or any cartoon character by any means. The character designer's job to make them appealing when animated. I think about Don Bluth's characters, not realistic at all but they convey so much emotion when animated, it's amazing! GW2 characters aren't even that exaggerated, I feel they're a nice semirealistic/stylized mix that kinda works.  
---
I know where you're coming from with the "oversized tits" statement and while I get that it can be tiring (esp for a straight girl) to always see stupidly bouncy and exaggerated anatomy shove in your face that's really not the case with this game... and by the way did you see male norn's ankles?? Or neck? They're thick like logs. I still enjoy playing them tho :P
---
I think that at some point we were really close to have Guild Wars 3 as a beetle racer game. 
---
Now we are closer to having kind of Marvel-like post-dragon dystopia with superhero commanders flying in capes everywhere.
---
That's awesome info. Thanks for the tip! Where do you do the exchange?
---
You can hide the stowed weapons?!
---
No one ever do benchmark numbers in raids or fractals because benchmarks are farmed and you never move nor do you have to do any tactics and the golem never even hit you or move off or phase.
---
People's imagination is a wild and usually an illogical thing.
---
This is nice tbh xD some fresh energy
---
Inb4 "anet nerf plz"
---
Yaaay maybe we can dye existing backpacks in the future too
---
Buying glyphs is quite inefficient gold-wise, it'll take some months to break even (if you convert gold &gt; gems). Even at a low price ([was around 310g in October](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/88045-Glyph-of-Volatility-Unused)) it's still over 900g in total. This is almost the average price of 2,700 gems.
---
Though, in my opinion, glyphs should be used for convenience. Volatile is fine as it'll net you money eventually, but can also help to get those Ascended trinkets. That's why I bought the Glyph of Industry for ax and pick, and Glyph of Bounty for sickle (chance of extra pick - on plants an extra pick is double the yield, so more Winterberries, cultivated ingredients and flax).
---
Well some of the dye slots barely change the color. For example on the heavy legendary armor all dark colors do nothing and all look like silver. You can even put on Shadow Abyss and you still have that forced white shine. And the "glowing" parts can be barely changed too, it's always a variation of white. If you look at gem store items or outfits with glowing parts you will notice the difference. If you change their glowing slot the glow actually changes to that color and not to white with a slight tint of that color.
---
Honestly they probably bring it like that so that people aren't going to pick a statement like that apart. I'm sure there's probably some things that can be done on the technical side of things, but if it ends up that doing that for all of them(because they can't do it for some off them, they wouldn't hear the end of it) is just much more effort then they can or are allowed to spend on it, summarizing that as "we can't convert older back pieces"  is going to save them a lot of headaches later on.
---
&gt; Some of us may remember back a month ago when it was reported that Arena Net was considering making a Guild Wars 3 of sorts.
---
I made a completely other observation that it actually was just something the community projected would or has to happen to save the franchise.
---
&gt; What if Guild Wars 3, to Anet, wasnt going to be a MMORPG at all, but a whole different genre of gameplay set in the Guild Wars IP?
---
That would be a pretty bold move as a "sequel". I mean GW1 and GW2 are fairly connected through the lore and them both being Online and Role-Playing games.
---
In general, you don't want to confuse your players. As you said Warcraft 1 to 3 were all RTS games but they are a different IP than World of Warcraft. The term IP, intellectual property, defines the context of the game which is different between Warcraft and World of Warcraft. They depict the same lore but are still different.
---
&gt; Guild Wars 1 is a Co-op Action RPG game
---
Not fully correct. It was a Cooperative Online Role-playing game, a Coop Action RPG would suggest it is only coop which it is not.
---
A franchise with sequels and prequels really stays in some format so that the player is not confused. That is why you have "Warcraft" and "World of Warcraft" and not Warcraft 4 which is an MMORPG or World of Warcraft 2 which is an RTS...
---
A game that is a sequel to online role-playing games that is not an online role-playing game will probably not called GW3.
---
Guild Wars: Beetle Racer (Mario Kart Style) or Guild Wars: Mist Warriors (MOBA) could be some names...
---
I dont pretend the game, especially wvw, is healthy. It isnt.
---
It's funny to watch this thread.
---
Completely clueless carebears raging for positivity and how they like being cuddled and handheld in wvw. 
---
But if they actually get ingame and do this they either outnumber or get stomped reliably. Because even in a fluffy environment their gameplay and cooperation is still garbage. But dont tell them, they wont like it if you do.
---
Meanwhile same carebears upset people like swaggy arent being enthusiastic and nice enough... but get ingame and they'll queue for hours to try to follow him because his groups can carry them. And OP cannot. 
---
The truth is when push comes to shove pugs rather get carried than be taught, nicely, while getting pubstomped to Narnia.
---
So let's see how this one works out :))) I'm sure itll be entertaining.
---
Looks good tbh...remember the the blacklion traiding post ican change ? That was rly .. no words for this but the lfg change made me happy again.
---
I find most GS skins quite fugly, so please no. Hah!
---
Oh yeah, the over reflective metals... Yeah, it's bad, it seems to be harsher in the preview tho. But yes, they really should touch up that reflection and the highlights too. I'd personally want a 4th slot for the animations that occur when wielded (the flash you see on all the armor).
---
Not really, Drakkar was named after the lake.
---
Drakkar is bigger than Primordus. If you look at the render it's huge.
---
Yeah and with a torch maybe it could be like a treasure hunter thing
---
&gt; Not really. GW2 was funner back then, when each member of the party was essentially in charge of their own survival based on their understanding of enemies' mechanics and their own ability to utilize their class's damage mitigation and healing, while still maintaining a high level of DPS.
---
You mean stacking in a corner and double fgs spam to kill bosses in under 5 seconds???
---
That got REALLY old REALLY fast.
---
Game kinda sucked back then imho.
---
your numbers are off, it's like this: CA5=8might,CA4=10might, CA123=2might
---
my point was more about the fact that CA4 also heals and is worth qd-ing unlike CA5(i know it has situational use with cc, slow i mentioned this already)
---
you might be right about the healing output of LL though, i just don't see how the numbers work out or why..it certainly "feels" like a lot for what that's worth
---
Thematic stuff. That matches my armor choice of fashion
---
My Norn guardian uses the corrupted skins and Nevermore (when using staff) while my Salad Guardian uses some of the Nightmare armor and  a variety of the Caladbolg/plant themed weapon skins.
---
My elonian Sunspear themed warrior uses the Mordant Crescent Weapons, as thematically she's been running guerilla ops against them and taking their weapons as loot.
---
These are just examples :)
---
There was ZERO proof that they were gonna work on GW3. All we know is that one of the projects was a mobile game.
---
Easiest ways to gear up would be either TP or karma merchants in Orr. But for some stats (like Viper), there's not much to do except leveling your crafting (or getting incredibly luck with Fractals, Raids etc). 
---
A benefit of crafting is that it's just a one-time leveling for potentially dozens of new characters. It also helps with account-bound materials and generates a good amount of gold (if you take time to research what's worth crafting - 2 weeks ago Restored Boreal weapons were selling for 18g-20g each).
---
In-game, it seems some Norn and Kodan mention it WAS Jormag there, but the devs themselves state otherwise. The lore does too
---
I don't know how gw2 works, but it's usually not "just a texture"
---
&gt; It also crashes when I try to take a screenshot via prntscrn.
---
Who taught you that?
---
Blasphemy!!!!
---
You're supposed to use your phone to take a picture of the screen.
---
&gt;If you look at the render it's huge.
---
This doesn't mean he's bigger than Primordus. We've barely seen part of his face in GW2 and it's gigantic.
---
https://m.imgur.com/a/qA8Ll - from /u/that_shaman
---
Primordus’ Jaw is bigger than Drakkar!
---
GW3 will be a subscribption based pay2win windowsphone exclusive mobile VR MOBA single jrpg tabletop simulator.
---
Wild Josh Foreman appeared!
---
Oooh yeah that sounds cool! The armor piece could be gauntlets that look like bandages for fighting!
---
again speaking for "everybody",eh? you will never learn.
---
and hey, at least I have dumbasses like you that still care! :D
---
It is so hard I haven't killed it yet. I've been on at least 10 different public groups with endless amount of wipes. No-one seems to get past 70% and my character often seems to be the first one downed. I spam dodge, block, invu and everything, not working.
---
"Light fires", I go light a fire but my character often get downed on the way to the fire or get downed a moment later. "Kill adds", I try my best to dash out some cleave damage to adds, but they simply won't die, also no-one seems to pull them together. "Please ress", I go ress downed players inside AoE but then my character gets downed too.
---
Difficulty went from strike mission to actual raid. Not sure if that was intended, strike missions should be doable with random public groups. Not like raids, where a certain comp and planning is required. Actually, raids are easier, there a healer and a tank takes care of everything while I simply follow DPS rotation.
---
It is nice as a raid though. I hope strike missions won't develop toxic players or new type of KP to enter, or many players will be locked out.
---
Welcome into outdated content.
---
Yes! Lets request dyeable back pieces, this is certainly one of the most important changes that needs to be made. Along with more buyable items on the trading post. We could also limit cat commander tags, by introducing other tags on the Trading Post.
---
2 Healbrands and one heal Tempest can mitigate pretty much everything if the Healbrands use their reflects properly and the save the AOE stun break from the Elite Mantra to use during the pull mechanic.
---
Add one Alacrity renegade, a Banner Warrior, with 2 Scourge pulling wisps and using epi who light torches, and 3 other DPS, and you are set to cruise to gold.
---
Same. In fact, since GW1 Drakkar is big enough, I wouldn't mind if they settled on this for Jormag's design in the first place. Just toss on some Icebrood crystals, some spikes on its back, and boom.
---
Why do we need reflects?
---
Bruh, you posted cringe.
---
The usage of Guardian is exactly the problem though. Those examples are exactly why it's so stale.
---
I dont know why but the dopey look of the jaw over all those locations killed me.
---
Just to expand on what Treize_XIII said - the highest level fractal a  group can enter is the same as the highest personal level in the group.
---
So if you're all personal level 5, you can only enter up to fractal level 5. If someone with fractal level 100 is in the group, you can enter all of them.
---
But aren't the rifts working now? (At least at the new map it seems like it) So couldn't they just re-release that achievement ..
---
actually slightly better. k/d is nearly 0 at all borders outside of ebg. WSR still loses the matchup by far, and on two borders their k/d ratio is pretty bad. 
---
they do a good job bringing always numbers to nearly any camp they go, our people just like fighting too much and jump into outnumbered fights.
---
 that's also what is causing Shiverpeaks' k/d ratio - they have constantly a 10-20 people roamergroup on our hbl bay. some of the "kills" are simply suiciding-engages to remove their attempts to open bay there.
---
Yeah true, although I feel that was just one (technically two) period. There was also a period where some other classes could be swapped in for specific purposes. We had some pretty good balance some time ago before Guardian recieved a bunch of buffs. And while I absolutely love Guardian and they deserved those buffs, I think they got buffed again after that in the wrong ways. 
---
Still having a good time. Bug it's definitely starting to be a drag lately.
---
Sorry, I've read the comments on this thread and I'm wondering, why the hate? I understood they are from other servers. But lmao.
---
Only since Tuesday.
---
Fuck Yeah it’s the best time of the month! :AYAYA:
---
macbooks are okay. unless you want to use them for gaming. then they're trash
---
That's how casuals play...and the hardcore ones that kept it feeling more alive on a daily basis have recently been slowly leaving because there's no new additional content being added for us. It gets tiring waiting endlessly for something that does not happen.
---
So, you see...catering to only casuals could, would, and will never keep the game (or any game really) alive. It's a poor decision that ANet made. Competitiveness within a game (PvP and/or PvE) is a necessity for a game to thrive.
---
They're just repeating what Teapot said.
---
Please do. Would like to see your take on Power Reaper.

and someone must have woken up on the wrong side of the bed this morning

I already own all the 32 slot bags I want/need.  And I crafted one of the new ones already.
---
We already have ALT+F4 for that.  ANet is wasting resources on a feature the game already has!
---
Stop
---
This thread is literally about how they've disabled that functionality.
---
It only hides them in combat.
---
if they added daily dungeons i would honestly come back to this game
---
I'm sorry its an idiotic argument "the game is dead because my friends left". If that means I'm toxic then fine fill your boots but if I see an idiotic argument I'm going to call it out. Now if he could back it up with facts and figures your know evidence then I'd take it seriously but going off the amount of friends who still play as a metric of the games health is not an argument its trolling.
---
Some people really aren't clever.
---
Theyre talking about GW1 Primordus
---
&gt;I tried to met new players but even they suddenly stops to login.
---
&gt; i duno if its incredibly easy. I'm sure it's not nearly as easy as doing a "mirror image" in photoshop. 
---
It literally is, no jokes. You don't even need a separate model, just mirror it ingame. Again, surprised it's not available in the character creation, guess no one thought about it (I know I didn't).
---
just post an lfg and it always fills
---
Theyre talking about gw1 primordus
---
You complain about grind, then suggest even more grind.
---
That's an awful idea, let people do the content they want.
---
&gt; i randomly picked this servers as a newbie 1,5 years ago and didn't swap anywhere. back then it was only medium filled and still mostly t1.
---
If you had played longer you'd known its history, which you're currently repeating. But don't you worry, you're still so noob you don't even see what you're doing. You want to teach others but you refuse to take advise yourself. A true example indeed. 
---
&gt; ur terms don't even makes sense mate, "roaming servers" don't exist, at least not in our matchups. and why would i switch servers, i like mine, i won't and can't help the people from other servers even. theres no cross-server play. 
---
Funny you start teaching right when your server is overstacked. You talk about bandwagoners and yet you're recruiting more right now. You talk about roaming servers not existing and yet you have zero experience outside of your server and matchup. And within your own server, nobody on discord has a clue who you are or why you'd post this to reddit. 
---
So what do you know? How to get warkitty? good meme. 
---
&gt;it isn't my fault that you rather spread rants and hate on the web instead of trying to help your people on your server. 
---
I'd wager I've helped far more players in WvW than you have. But you're correct - it's not your fault I rather spread rants and hate towards complete monkeys in WvW than spread positivity. 
---
It's not my fault spreading hate towards complete idiots who think they're helping is a more useful deterrent than trying to teach them anything. 
---
But I admit, if it was possible to play WvW without having to deal with idiots 24/7 there would be no need for toxicity and hate as a deterrent. Unfortunately that's not the case, and it will continue to get worse. So will the toxicity :) 
---
&gt; by the way we're pretty far from 90% of still active veterans. idk if even 50% of the veterans are left, compared to those when i started 1,x years ago. 
---
I understand you have difficulties with how one thing does or does not imply another. So I'll try to spell it out more clearly. 
---
what I wrote was : 
---
&gt;the only matchup with 90% of the active veterans in it.
---
That means the matchup of deso / WSR / FSP has 90% of the remaining veterans (aka those that still play) in T1, not T2 / T3 / T4 / T5. 
---
This statement tells you NOTHING, at all, about the amount of veterans compared to a year ago. So where is that coming from? I have no clue but I assume you're clueless.
---
It also does not say the matchup consists of 90% veterans. In no way does 90% of the active veterans being in your matchup imply that your matchup is populated by 90% veterans. So where is that coming from? I have no clue but this further suggests you are indeed clueless. 
---
I'd like to ask you a question. Why is it that every deso person that has replied in this thread is shitposting or meming and at -5 rather than supportive of your initiative? Why won't they support you? 
---
Why is it that even deso discord assumes you're a rando pug that hates discord at worse, and uninformed at best? They've pointed it out, you didn't inform them, talk to them, organise anything, ask if any of them wanted to be a part of what you do. Nada. 
---
tl dr : You have good intentions. However, you don't undrestand WvW. You're also not very bright. What you are doing is more harmful than helpful, which is why you are getting many negative responses. Don't let this stop you, go for it. You'll see that many players who like the idea of your initiative will nope out sooner than you'd like... And probably go follow tF Swaggy intead LUL.
---
The living story is awesome!
---
It wasn't always Drakkar. It was assumed to be Jormag until 2011 when the devs confirmed it was just a champion.
---
Which is completely different to what we've seen in GW2.
---
Again, it doesn't mean he's bigger than Primordus, much less when Drakkar's model will be changed completely.
---
&gt; The game is fine.
---
Well said white knight, well said.
---
Idk what's worse, people saying the game feels dead or the desperate white knights swearing the game is fine.
---
&gt;I'm sorry its an idiotic argument 
---
You should know a lot about idiotic arguments taking into account you're one of the main members of this sub that swear everything is perfectly fine and that things are better now.

* 2 Cscourge/DDs doing torches with portal/shadowstep (epi on Scourge)
---
* Qfb
---
* Diviner Chrono with focus for pull
---
* Self explanatory tactic
---
Meme tactic:
---
* 6 good self buffing/healing rifle DEs (1 per torch)
---
It's only been disabled in PvP, if that's what you're asking about, so it will still work just fine in other modes. As for whether or not it's possible for them to tie the visibility to specific templates, it's probably not *impossible*, the real question is if implementing it is the work of two days or two months. It's not like there's an existing option for it that they just aren't using for some reason, or the visibility of things like back items would probably have been per-template right from the start.
---
It's funny you used quotes for something he never said.  That is not how quotes are used.  How ironic that you called him idiotic. 
---
 &gt; Now if he could back it up with facts and figures
---
Everyone knows that ANET does not, and will never, release infomation that shows a declining player population.  He referenced they only metric that is available to him.
---
You are a raider aren't you. Sorry for you loss. May I have your stuff ?
---
I will be honest with you here. I played since day 0, I have seen lots of people trying the game, some stayed , most left.   
---
   
---
Story is always the same if someone fell in love with the game from start. Enjoy leveling, exploring, this person have high chance to stay in the game.   
---
  
---
EVERYONE who were bored at start with leveling left. Leveling is in open world doing events. This is what this game is about. this is what devs are focused on, this is where game is updating the most.  
---
In other words if you dont like leveling, open world, events. You will quit. That is that simple. As this is what you will be doing over and over again at the end anyway.   
---
So here is a tip for you, leave now. game is not for you if you are already bored at 24 level...  
---
I know you will not agree, as people dont like when others tell them what to do. But in few weeks you will quit, when that happen remind youself of this post. And you will say "shit he was right"
---
For real though, 
---
Want to get people back into central tyria maps for more than when one is the soup du jour?
---
Make all tyria hearts repeatable, and once you complete the map, when you come back, completing a repeated heart lets the vendor sell you (once per day per heart per account) a small amount of dungeon tokens for the region it's in (for the regions with multiple, offer both but you can only pick one).
---
Even just 2-5 tokens per heart would give PvEers a way to unlock those skins, and get those gifts without having to form a group to take on unsupported content.
---
Better yet, add the option for a tiny bottle of WvW reward track potion as well, or a central tyria currency that can be traded to WvW vendors for the potions.
---
"Grind" isn't "What I would rather not do" or "One thing I did before and I don't want to repeat again", it's "Repeating something over and over". 
---
"Every fractal level" many not be something everyone may enjoy (nothing is), but it's not grind, specially not over the span of several months, letting players do them in their own time..  
---
And doing many different hings helps others doing each thing, which is the whole point of achievements like dailies. Get people to go to the same places and do the same things.
---
Even with dungeon dailies people may just do Path 1 and never the others. With a much logner term achievement that requires you to do all 3 paths, it'll be more likely to find others who also do all 3 paths.
---
once more such a simple concept that not many seem to grasp the significance of.
---
I don't know what mental disorders you have, but I hope you find help soon and become healthy. People like you are a burden for us all, but there are good psychiartrists out there who can help you. Go out and get some help, you don't need to be stucked in this wretchedness you show us here.
---
I actually did that whole side story tab recently. Doing this on daily map days is actually harder. It's easier with a smaller group because the event scaling. With a smaller group ( &lt;8 I think? Maybe 10?) you don't get the champs. The champs take a while to go down, and almost always get an energy in before doing so. When doing the achieves I found daily maps were really hit or miss for the event succeeding, much less Thwart the inquest. People on the daily maps really only cared about getting credit, so they didn't care to figure out how the event worked and ignored energy or a bunch of champs spawned and we didn't have the dps to beat them. People on daily maps also tended to tag and run. Im on NA though, don't know how EU players tend to be there.
---
I had no trouble getting help on maps without the daily, though I mostly did it on weekends a few hours before reset. You don't need a ton of people to succeed.  I put up a tag, called out in mapchat for help, and explained the event during the walk there.  There were 5 or 6 of us when I got Thwart the Inquest. Another player and I stood on the inquest side and focused solely on destroying golems before they got back to base. Stunning/imobolizing them helped. Everyone else ran energy and dps'd the golems like normal. We only had to deal with elites and lower, which should be easy for 2 decently skilled players.
---
I would try tagging on maps during peak hours or getting a group of guildies. It took me about 10 runs at this event to get Thwart the Inquest, so patience is key.
---
Can I ignore people on reddit? Im new here. Looks like @Guildwars1996 is someone paid to mislead people.
---
GW2 is not a game to login daily for everyone. Some players log in every 3 days, others every 3 weeks, others every 3 months, some even every 3 years. 
---
They all come back eventually, and with real life issues complicating things, it can be hard to get a group of players with your same schedule.
---
That doesn't mean the game is dead. I do a map completion every day, and I'm yet to see a single open world map map ever having less than 30 players inside other than tutorial instances and the HoT prologue, which aren't really open world maps, but large shared instances. 
---
Just yesterday I ended up in an empty Dragon's Stand map, popped a tag, the map got filled with random people, we pugged the meta as if it was the first day.
---
I hate to be that guy but the game seems to have less people actively playing it than ever. We barely, and I mean barely complete meta's now. Like shit we almost failed the BJora event and I recently saw Dragons fall fail, hell I've even seen Silverwastes fail durring peak hours. So now its not all sunshine and rainbows, because even when fractals, wvw, and pvp were all faltering the open world was at least booming.  
---
You can keep being willfully ignorant but I play all avenues of the game and it does feel REALLY dead, even WvW reset which is my primary mode seems dead half the time. And Im paired with Maguuma unfortunately for me but normally they have killer numbers.... not of late. I've seen whole days where not a single squad is running and its just us roamers taking camps and junk
---
Some have been fixed, but not all.
---
My guess is that they'll return the next time they need a bit of filler content between festivals and releases after they are all fixed.
---
There are a few people like that around. If you use Reddit Enhancement Suite you'll find the same people doing the same things over and over, but it's only a few and you'll figure them out quickly.
---
it's disable in raids in general  
---
since t's a "raid" encounter the same rules apply.
---
Drakkar was bigger than Primordus' GW1 model.
---
Heh, never noticed before. Though I achieved a record of being downed on Twin Largos. I should have noticed then!
---
&gt; ArenaNet could sell individual hairstyles in the gem store
---
They did just that before, by adding new hairstyles (and faces) to the makeover kits. Unfortunately they've decided that's not worth their time anymore since there hasn't been new styles added in ages.
---
It really depends how you define dead.  If you are a long time consistent player.  Game is dead.  There is nothing for you to look forward to in the future except maybe a small story update every 2-3 months.
---
This game is for casuals and new players now.  Plenty for new players to do and for casuals to keep up with at a casual pace.
---
For months the guild I was in that used to be for veteran and long term players saw recruitment and activity flatline after the August announcement.  Raid teams were disbanded because of lack of interest.  T4 fractal and wvw raid attendance is at an all time low.  People just have stopped logging on after the last episode.  Why wouldn't they.  The game is completed and moving foward at a snail's pace.
---
We recently switched to focusing on new players. Doing dungeons, lowbie fractal tours, and training raids. Recruitment is up again, but so few people actually log on regularly to actually make meaningful progression into high end play.  This game becomes really forgettable after you complete the story.  
---
Especially when all of its end game modes are seeing a such a sharp decline in activity.
---
While the game isn't going anywhere while people are willing to throw money at stuff like capes.  Its pretty much a mobile game mentality right now.  They have no monitary reason to invest in developing content.  This is something you do when your bored with your main games.
---
Keep in mind that the cheapest estimates for skyscale require crafting sky scale food and a grow lamp. Which both require quartz Crystal which aren't easy to farm and the latter also requires a leveled up jeweler which if you don't already have would have to pay for.
---
So your argument is: "If I ignore all the sources of critchance you mentioned, more critchance is needed!"
---
I listed all the sources I was considering, and they bring you to ~47.57% critchance. 1996 precision provides ~52.43% critchance. No banners, no spotter.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Building around the idea that you won't be able to get your critchance modifiers is the opposite of minmaxing.
---
Nope. I actually ripped the two, and others, and Primordus was the bigger of the two. Granted, what was *visible* of Primordus wasn't much bigger, but it was bigger. Though perspective, and the fact Primordus was in an instance while Drakkar in the open world, does make it seem like they're closer to the same size or that Primordus was smaller.
---
The devs did try to retcon Primordus into not being Primordus but a dragon champion though, for the same reason of size. And under the pretense of "we never said that was Primordus in GW1" (which is false, btw). It's unclear if they have maintained that out-of-game claim though. Regardless of the retcon though, it makes sense that Primordus would be the smallest Elder Dragon, given that he moves underground. The head we saw in S3 is entirely an impractical size for an underground dragon.
---
So, I don't think this game is dead at all if anything it's still one of the big four western MMOs out there, and I feel like it's still kicking.
---
Mac
---
Laptop
---
Gaming 
---
You can only pick two.
---
So you can move the bags from character to character within your account.  Previous ones once you used them they were locked to a single character
---
I heard this in the voice of Gomer Pyle.
---
Nightwish!
---
&gt; Almost all of my friends stopped playing and those who remained are very silent.
---
In other words, it's just you. 
---
Rating by how active your friends are is really subjective. My friend for example are active every day. 
---
Take a look at popular meta events/maps and lfg, you will find many players, even if they aren't you friends. And if you make your own lfg, you will still find people for almost everything
---
At launch, outfits were called town clothes, and were as individually dyeable as armor.  
---
They removed the "town clothes" option and added outfits instead.  They completely reworked the entire system.  
---
When they say there's no way to make backpacks or weapons dyeable, they're full of shit. There's no easy way, maybe? I buy that. No way at all? Nonsense.
---
WOW! Real pro gamer right here yall!
---
Get yalls cameras out it ain't everyday we get to see this!
---
Yes, but currently no because it's causing crashes and is temporarily disabled.
---
Guild wars 1 story, including all expacs, more fleshed out story, singleplayer rpg.
---
omg this is pure internet gold
---
This just in, fat people can't run and jump and fight I guess (also, body fat distribution means things like cankles wouldn't develop/would disappear faster than belly fat on an active but thicker male, but sure let's hide behind "it's not realistic anyway and I'm totally not being fatphobic here by pointing out I think they'd have abs yet still have cankles" instead).
---
You felt the need to respond at all to "disprove" that female humans outnumber all other character combinations that exist by a large margin, and that MANY utilize the exact same small subset of faces/hairstyles/clothing options (such as, but far from limited to, the pictured hairstyle in Celestial of all colors ofc.)
---
'Enlighten me', why engage at all if you WEREN'T being defensive? Why be argumentative over it unless you had to, for your own mental state I guess, disprove what I'm saying? By advocating for "the other side" you were undeniably acting defensive.
---
Digital deluxe is just an armor skin I think and character slot
---
You'll get an extra shared Inventory slot and booster so you'll have 2
---
I'm not sure if you have to be level 80 already to start PoF story. Once you have mounts u locked they are account wide so I believe an under 80 chars get could use them. It's just clarifying whether you must be 80 to start PoF which I believe is the case.
---
... Need a kleenex?
---
"I'm not defensive"
---
Responds outside her comment thread where we were already having a discussion.
---
Sure babe, sure not defensive at all.
---
Thread removed: Spamming is not allowed.

Don't mess with their female human meta or they cry :(
---
This doesn't come off as defensive on the topic in the slightest/s
---
Way to go though babe, you're doing great
---
yeah old fractals were not very rewarding at all, some were fun, but most were a slog.
---
It's the other way around. It's ~40g with a huge timegate if you craft everything yourself because you need to use multiple timegated materials (Quartz and some or the recipes are daily I think). It costs a lot more ~115g if you buy everything from the TP and then you eliminate most of the timegates, except the mandatory ones which are around three days.
---
1) Berserker.
---
2) Nope.
---
3) have you finished putting points in your legends? Also the energy bar fills at a constant rate, how much damage you're doing doesn't affect it. What legend are you using that won't let the skills work?
---
&gt; Imagine running no heal fractals
---
i ran berserker druid for the longest time. you all don't know the hilarity that is ret buff, axe 5, signet of stone and the old Unity ult.
---
Stavemaster (LOL blackhole) just falls to the floor
---
1) Oh is it always going to say "Beserker" for stats on things? That makes it a lot easier lol
---
2) Awwwwwwww.
---
3) I think it is Assassin and the Dwarf. It's preset until I accept the 80 boost.
---
Thanks!
---
Does the hero pannel still reset everytime you close it ?
---
* Each Booster comes with a free shared inventory slot.
---
* You don't have to get to level 80 if you join someone else's story and complete the first heart inside the story, then buy the Raptor from the heart vendor, but to get the raptor on your own you must be level 80 to start the PoF story.
---
* The digital deluxe is only worth it if you value [its contents](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2:_Path_of_Fire%E2%80%94Digital_Deluxe_Upgrade). You can get it with gems, so it can be bought with cash or in-game coin. It's 25 bucks more, but getting 2400 would cost 30, so you'd save 5. The estimated value of the contents would be:
---
 * 800  - 1 char slot
---
 * 700  - 1 outfit
---
 * 1000 - identity repair kit
---
     * Makeover kit (350)
---
     * Name change (800)
---
 * 1000 - Vip pass to special area in Amnoon.
---
 That's  3500 worth of gems for 2400. But unless you really want the outfit and the VIP pass, getting the other stuff can be cheaper with other methods.
---
Fractals are anoying, they are not hard, they are not complicated. They just have bullshit piled on top of them.
---
Dungeons are just chill. They don't need to be super hard or complex for people to enjoy them.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Like non of the content in gw2 is hardhard, some is just slightly harder than the rest.
---
And who are you to tell others what to enjoy?
---
A while ago you could actually buy it. About $350 if I remember correctly. It never was ment to be bought but sometimes the company is quite funny. They also have funny ads. They will sometimes print comments to products as advertisement, the sillier/negativ the better.
---
Example

Basically says: "it's not to underestimate how awsome it is to unplug the switch while playing and be able to continue with the same settings while taking a dump."
---
Brb gotta get some friends to try the meme tactics.
---
Yup buy high mobility speces like daredevil are squishy as heck, the aura just wrecks them in no time.
---
Engineers are supposed to swap to kits in combat, like the holoforge or elixir kit. I always found them irritating.
---
I'm not actually sure why the legend utility skills aren't working, I think I used tomes to max a character instead of leveling it normally. Sorry I can't help more.
---
When they will give us free Black Lion Keys? - dreaming...zZz
---
Even back then, lupi has nothing on the 3 new strike missions
---
I didn't have time to look at the source code.  
---
The problem with Anet and the rules is not what the plugin would do but the method to use.
---
To simplify:
---
* If the plugin only uses the API to retrieve the data, it's good for Anet
---
* If the plugin, uses memory parse as ArcDPS BuildTemplate did (in part) then it is directly prohibited, only ArcDPS had and has an explicit authorization to give it alone the right to do this.
---
In short, Anet are very serious about this and no matter what the tool does, once again I had time to see how it works in terms of code but the key elements is the method used, API = green, memory parse = red
---
Just asking for LEG Back piece. The amount of people who has it is minimal.
---
Yes.
---
No, thanks.
---
That was fixed one patch before.
---
Overall engineer has an access to the smallest pool of weapons of all professions. It was supposed to be compensated with weapon kits, a 'weapon' in your utility slots, and even worked quite well for a few years, but then powercreep came and core engi was pretty much left behind. Holo is great tho, pretty much carries the profession.
---
Wow, that's great insight! Many thanks :)
---
New hairstyles and faces launched with PoF. I can't say for sure there have been any since but I know that much.
---
And 24 or 28?
---
Just to point out about #2, the laser sword is a skin you can apply to any sword you use. So while you can't use 2 laser swords on engineer (they can't duel-wield with swords), you could do that with warrior, you can do so with warrior, revenant or mesmer. Of those 3 i'd say sword/sword revenant is most satisfying to play.
---
There are 3. So yea it would be a start but still it's not just one.
---
Level up Ravager. They are basically better monks but can also DPS with the shadow build. Just don't spend hero points immediately on running speed but instead focus on expertise for better group synergy.
---
A lot (if not all) of the paragon elites are lacklustre at best, and I say that as someone that loves the class and actually just got playing again and bought the FoW armour I wanted to get over 10 years ago for it. The only one that sees in any regular use in the game at the moment is "Incoming!" and that's sometimes taken on a N/P minion master hero to increase movement speed around the map.
---
That would be extremely broken.  
---
Now, illusions should shatter when enemies are downed, and downed enemies should not be targetable by illusion skills.  Mesmers have plenty of other tools to deal with a downed player. 
---
Also, until the stealth bug that makes animations desynch with the actual finisher, making it look as if the finisher just started when leaving stealth instead when it actually started, stealth should be removed upon starting a finisher.
---
Let's see:
---
1) painting the opponent as a vile person, check
---
2) bold claims about emotional state, check
---
3) putting words into the opponent's mouth, check
---
4) claiming that because of one critique, the opponent must hate the entire thing, check
---
5) when in doubt call them a troll, check
---
Congratulations babe, your debating skills are as piss-poor as your attempt at masking your defensiveness! Go back to lurking.
---
Take a ritualist hero (if you have Eye of the North you can get one pretty easily early on) with the Soul Twisting elite, Shelter, Union and Displacement spirits and have your paragon with those skills and you barely even need a healer most of the time, even in hard mode! I've been playing my paragon a lot lately, and with that combination, you can easily get by with one healer in 99% of the PvE content.
---
u did not answer
---
or u did?
---
I like how you weren't trying to do damage in the post-patch one despite having better boons
---
At least fractals have mechanics
---
don't get me wrong i know where you coming from as well
---
i experimented around with various builds on thief even and not just with high crit chances but also with different runes and vita/toughness values. I came to the conclusion that if you face an actual opponent (if you can call an npc that) the higher crit chance you allows you to counter heal in critical situations. Even tho the heal is slightly lower it is more consistent and on an average slightly higher as well (i did optimize for ascended gear when i did that tho which gives you way better base stats on which the loss of 252 power is not as extreme compared to exotic gear)
---
While not just having on average better heal the consistency brought it over the top cause it prevents you from not getting any heal if you miss a crit or even 2 crits in a row if you're really unlucky.
---
Both builds work!!  
---
In an optimal scenario your build obviously does more dmg but not that much more that it would kill an enemy a lot faster. The build i came up with has just slightly more sustain.  
---
Which of those you want is just personal preference.
---
In the End the most important part is that you know how to play your build anyway and not how you min maxed it
---
Dunno. No one uses that title anyways.
---
Digital deluxe comes with passive 10% boost to mastery xp so if you are planning on maxing them all it's pretty useful
---
&gt; PvEvP
---
Yup. Definitely a dream.
---
Oh my bad, I like the size and design of GW1 Primordus.
---
They could also make Jormag's model bigger in GW2.
---
I like the design of Drakkar so Jormag would be cool to look like that rather than generic dragon.
---
just take heals
---
that statue might just be a small part of the actual creature. Like Zhaitan.
---
Still broken, feels worse than before.. Sometimes not even displaying the right icon to the Skill that lies there.
---
I don't think they sell that well in the first place.
---
Also, your "argument" was already used 6 years ago, when people started suggesting the PvE wardrobe. See how that turned out.
---
­&gt; Mandalorian wears...
---
Dude. Was working on a Medium Armor mandalorian and the visor/helmet is the **only** thing I'm missing.
---
If you want double sword you can pick mesmer, warrior and revenant.
---
and lets keep it that way
---
Give them ideas. You're doing great, my child
---
Sha Gas mmmm
---
I really don't want to see more of the Brand for a long while (ever again)
---
[Here all 3 my heavy armored classes: Guardian, Warrior and Revenant](https://imgur.com/a/hnCC99T) and not a single piece of armor on them is from the gem store.  
---
Proper dyeing and mix-matching can do miracles.
---
Why are you going so far for pugs?
---
You can nit pick specific examples all you want in order to make it look like things never got better, but they did. It doesn't change the fact that western civilisations were advancing. We were on a trajectory of becoming more accepting, making great strides in terms of rights and equality. Women can work and vite now. Black peopke too. Gay people can marry in many places. Access to education inproved for minority groups and ao on. We started to see a shift toward more conservative attitudes emerging innthr last 10 years and it's continued to spread. My point was really just suggesting that this started in more political domains and I believe in seeing it permeate other areas too. I've noticed People really boil things down to "this" or "that" now and I don't remember it ever being that way as a child or young adult. It feels like a large step backwards.
---
I don't think you and I actually disagree on the sorts of topics and examples you've provided but I get the sense you haven't quite clicked what I'm getting at. That could well be my poor explanations.
---
&gt; You can even put on Shadow Abyss and you still have that forced white shine. And the "glowing" parts can be barely changed too, it's always a variation of white.
---
This reminds me [Mursaat Borgans](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heavy_Mursaat_Brogans).
---
And so do dungeons. fuckin AC path 2 has more mechanics than most of the fractals.
---
Fractals has instabilitys and agony.
---
\*Screams in agony over as of yet not doing Migraine and other associated achievements\*
---
Wow that is indeed nice
---
paskadk is a troll and nothing he's posted so far has been correct
---
What, the guy people brag about soloing and duoing? *That's* your point of reference?
---
Small skilled groups making their own content always makes me happy. GG
---
&gt;The pact was using kralkatorrik's brand magic to combat jormag.  their area of the battlefield was surrounded by branded ground, crystals  and minions. they were controlling the minions with some magical stuff i  guess. 
---
Aurene's been "purifying" Kralkatorrik's brand magic, as established in the Prologue, and hunting down all remaining Branded. According to the Prologue, there are no more branded creatures left, or very few. Besides that, the old branded were still hostile and devoted to Kralkatorrik as shown in the Prologue. There's no way the Pact *could* use them. Or would.
---
&gt;Yes, it  was a PvEvP map!
---
Outright never gonna happen.
---
&gt;  Instead, the entire map meta seemed to revolve around doing events that jormag told you to do.  
---
Now this is rather interesting. I doubt it'd happen, as I feel we'll end up having Jormag as an enemy in the end, but it's an interesting premise that goes a step further than Bjora Marches.
---
I'm not going to invest more energy into this. I have other more interesting things to attend to.
---
Yeah I'd prefer that.
---
In my opinion they have a lot of artificial difficulty on things without much nuance.
---
An enemy with an attack that instantly kills you is hard in the sense it can kill you out of nowhere, but that kind of all or nothing balance doesn't teach things very well.
---
I think fights would be better teachers for new players if they tended more towards sustained pressure and performing well over a period of time. Some enemies with spikes are ok, but right now they're overused I think.
---
&gt; Story's getting worse, the spaguetti code makes the game worse, no expansion, big firings, game's funds were being diverted, founders all left, still nothing for PvP/WvW, broken promises left and right.
---
Nothing else than your personal opinion. No arguments at all.
---
&gt; You guys can continue sucking up to ANet as much as you want, it won't change the truth no matter how much you keep trying to ignore it. 
---
The truth is that the game still runs fine after 7 years. Your insults won't change that.
---
&gt; I've been bringing up real arguments for months, it's YOU drones that keep trying to silence everyone that brings this up.
---
Is that so? The only "arguments" from you I see here are "*Whiteknight!!!*", "*Drones*" and several other insults. When people bring real arguments, you always answer the same "WhItEkNigHt" + other insults. No argument, nothing constructive, nothing objective. Everything you do is hating and raging against people , nothing else.
---
&gt; It's getting to the point you guys are even REPORTING me and others just to try to keep us all quiet and even the mods have mentioned i haven't broken any rules.
---
Okay, let the logic speak here. 
---
- If somebody reports you, you don't notice it. You don't get a message or anything. You can't know if somebody reported you. 
---
- You only can notice the RESULTS of reports such as deleted comments or warnings. 
---
- And IF your comments got deleted or got warnings, you DID break a rule. Otherwise a mod wouldn't delete anything or warn you.
---
- So when you say people reporting you, it's either a proof that the reports are justified and you broke the rules OR it's a proof that you are a liar.
---
&gt; But sure, keep it up, keep swearing the game is fine, keep reporting everyone that says otherwise.
---
You act like you are paranoid, you know?
---
&gt; Let's see what happens in the end once NCSoft starts to realize that keeping ANet afloat is no longer a benefit
---
Lmao, this won't happen, even if the game is dead for real. ;)
---
However, if you think GW2 brings no money to NCsoft, you are wrong. You should inform yourself instead of lying.
---
&gt;  since the only support they have comes from white knights on reddit.
---
Seems like you know that reddit includes less than 5% of a game's playerbase. It literally doesn't matter what somebody says on reddit. Also your hates and lies doesn't matter. But hey, we all keep reporting you and reddit obeys to our all reports to make you silent, because you are so important, right? Lmao. ;)

Boss mechanics are not the issue here. It doesn't matter if the fight has green circles and red triangles, or purple stars and rainbow hexagons, or yellow smiley faces and cyan parallelepipeds. It doesn't matter. It can be learned. Everything can be learned with a minimal amount of persistence. You cannot and should not expect to intuitively know how to fight every boss the first time you see him.
---
The issue is the mentality of casuals that prevents them from improving. From putting in that persistence to learn and improve. When I say they don't know how to play the game, I mean that they don't know that builds can be good and bad, that they detest that implication that it's OK to play a good build that wasn't made by you, the weapon that you don't like, that they don't know to "not stand in the fire", that they don't know how breakbars work, that they don't know what wide array of possibilities they have with their weapons and class skills, which of them are CC, hard, soft, mobility, defense... If you think I'm overexaggerating, I met a couple of players that satisfy half of what I wrote above just this very morning. In the strike mission. And they were more toxic than the raiders I encounter on a daily basis. To those players it doesn't matter if the circles are green or red or white. They are, and will be dead weight regardless.
---
...the Icebrood construct fails because people don't chain it. The Boneskinner fails because people don't CC it/utilize the map mechanics and they fail the secondary objective as a result. How are these artificially inflated difficulty ramp-ups when Raids exercise similar mechanics?
---
I didn’t play at Halloween 🎃 I should have. I’ll remember than trick for next year. I actually hate grinding in this game and mostly just WvW so I’m super poor
---
Funny to see how people think there is a ‘right’ way to play a game lol
---
Yeah it's very worth it! 18 slot bags are just fine, but filling up to 20 once a year is just a little better!
---
Extremely.
---
You can buy materials off of others. However ascended weapons/armor/trinkets all accountbound on acquire. So there is no way to buy them off of other players.
---
Dreams like that are pretty rare. Most of the time they are mundane things like going to buy groceries or making a sandwich.
---
Engineers can swap weapons!
---
Freaking finally!!!
---
Ok. Ac p2 has a "super fun" mechanic that takes 20x or more time than it takes to kill the actual boss.
---
And this is a pro for dungeons how?
---
&gt; Please stop throwing the "spaghetti code" excuse at everything.
---
I'm not an anet dev, you're barking up the wrong tree if you want the spaghetti code excuse to stop.
---
I've done this strike today and it's a piñata boss. Only dps and ez. No mechanicals.
---
Raid comp, ren + FB heal.
---
What a pleb...
---
True gamers make charcoal rubbings.
---
Plus, legendary gear in general is functionally irrelevant with equipment loadouts as they are.
---
I cut my lawn with a golden sickle just fine.
---
I agree. It's tedious. Just get rid of the timer all together and that will make this mastery more fun to use.
---
I imagine theyre probably going to have that sort of effect as a future mastery. Either that or someway of retaining the buff. I do see a concern of having it permanantly, it is rather strong.
---
The whole system is trash. Whoever thought of this idea should be fired.
---
At this point the only outfit your main is allowed to wear are cargo shorts.
---
Nothing about equipment templates has changed the value of legendary gear. It was always slower to change legendary gear stats than to equip ascended gear.its value remains in the ability to swap sigils runes and stats at a moments notice
---
We're supposed to learn? This already feels like school / work. I play gw2 to relax, not to learn things.
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Ran with a pug 1st time and got gold as well, dps was pretty decent but healers were tempest/scourge/healbrand, kill was like 2:10, could be way better but pretty ok for a pug, comp was basically 3 healers and rest dps, proper raid comp should get way better results, just stack and outheal/dps as it's a pretty quick fight, didn't really pay attention to mechs as well.
---
Idk why u get downvoted. 2-3 big heals + rest dps (some should bring quickness) and you can faceroll this boss
