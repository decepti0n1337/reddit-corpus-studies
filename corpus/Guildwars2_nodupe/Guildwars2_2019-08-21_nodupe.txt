I love that build &lt;3
---
---
---
How does this work actually? I use the bond, and find the Skritt location on map?
---
We are all friends!! unless you dont let me do what i want to do!
---
It definitely does.  And with room to dive at the start, the griffon will cover the distance much faster, too.
---

---
The advantage of Skyscale isn't going over flat terrain or covering horizontal distance, it's being able to gain height while flying.  A Griffon can only do that in very specific situations where there's room for a big dive initially.
---
socialrpg
---
Of course Black Lion Chests are worse and should not be supported either. But as you already pointed out they have been in the game for a long time, there is no point in talking about them again and again. The bonds are new, so it is worth pointing out that they fall into the same category.
---
&gt; Was it always in a massive skin box the first time they released Warclaw skins?
---
Yes it was.
---
It's amazing that when ANET had the design a weapon contest , you couldn't make any reference to drinking, drugs and gambling yet all of these things are in the actual game.
---
That sucks. There are only like 3 skins worth buying. I'm sure they just forced the other terrible skins to make it seem like a good deal.
---
Just ask Pokémon!
---
Depending how you look at it, can be considered as such I suppose.
---
You can also enter Diessa Plateau from your home city, the Black Citadel.  Entering from there will get you into the lower level area of the zone.
---
Honestly I hate the rule "you are not allowed to critizese mods" with a passion. No matter if its on 4chins, reddit, or your own forums it always brings up the worst in moderators and makes them immune to scrutiny.
---
What's the hardest material to get, aside from buying them?
---
WHY ARE SYLVARI EATING FRUIT SALAD OMG, ITS CANNIBALISM!!!
---
Because that's how they decided to sell it. 
---
Retailers, both online and physical, do this all the time. 
---
This is nothing unusual.
---
They set it up like that because they expect people will buy it.  If people don't buy it, then they'll change their system.
---
My Warclaw is happily unskinned.
---
Griffin also feels less clunky and more agile, it's my favorite mount for quick and efficient map completion, skyscale is handy in some cases but I'm not a fan of the sluggish movement and constant wall sticking...
---
One of the best skins imo, grats!
---
I'm gonna use the free one only. Gotta save my gems for that sweet, sweet character slot expansions and Total makeover kit sales.
---
I find that questionable. Adding legendary runes first only makes the entire system more complicated.  If build templates only work with legendary gear and legendary runes, then they will have really missed the mark.
---
That's not just the conditional bit, power/ferocity is a hard stat combo to beat.
---
I wanna spend the moment to great all renegade lovers out there. 
---
Sehrish loves you all.
---
Was a fun match tho
---
We checked, its not working.
---
Honestly, the hunting bonds aren't that bad... They're not new content added to the gemstore, not really, its just another way to get what's already in the gemstore. And for people looking to fill up their wardrobe at minimal cost, they are actually pretty interesting.
---
Buying 15 at 2400 gems makes a 160 gems per bond. Most unlocks in the gemstore are more expensive that that.
---
Lake Doric, Bitterfrost Frontier, Silverwastes, and Dry Top are not central Tyria but can be accesed from central Tyria so it’s nice of them to clarify
---
Thunderhead Peaks and Siren’s Landing can not be accessed from central Tyria
---
Mount Maelstrom counts within Maguuman for dailies, don’t rely on that shitty categorisation
---
I have played free accounts before and it's perfectly fine and enjoyable to start playing as a free account for quite a while until you finish everything available.
---
&gt;They must just not play PvP

Answered your own question

Congrats! That must be a lot of hard work! 
---
I just got to 14k myself yesterday!
---
People here will so no, but, yes.
---
Thanks, now I understand.
---
Is it not possible to remove AR from legendary armor? Or am I massively messing up?
---
Dragging the armor into Infusion Extractor isn't accepted and the Customize window doesn't seem to have an option for infusion removal either...
---
Interesting. Thanks!
---
What else would Mount Maelstrom count as?  Sparkfly Fen is also Maguuma Jungle.
---
I'd rather pay GW2 sub and have more content for fashion endgame instead of grinding for lootboxes

---
Lunar new year, because I get to make money.
---
Person doing this did probably started on those trying to guess the center and then did all the others once he knew where the center was but he never re-aligned the first ones.  
---
Alternatively, those were the last ones and the guy was like "Oh, great, i'm running out of time... bah, i'll put them fast, there is only 2 more left and I'm hungry, I'll fix it after lunch".
---
You forgot to name it Logan, that would bring you to top.
---
It's a lot lower amount of stats and pretty weak and temporary bonus. Not something you'd expect from ascended food.
---
Yeeeah, I'd maybe pay like 50 gems for one of these things, at MOST - 200 gems with the odds I'm working with in terms of things I have unlocked? No thanks. Feels like this one's aimed at the oldest players, which is fair but I'm still gonna be salty about it.
---
Nope these are banned on the Belgium store.
---
How awesome was your home instance before you started saying "join me for home instance farming" in map chat?
---
Like, I've got all the S3 and S4 nodes, but not a lot else.  Would people be like "eww, why'd i come to this lame home instance?" if I invited them in? 
---
What was the point where you said to yourself "aww yeah ppl will love this home instance, i should invite them"?
---
Gift of Poverty + Gift of the Elonian Kids + Gift of the Hunger Games
---
See, your problem is you read something and then come to wild asumptions instead of sticking with what was said. On the one hand did I clarify my statements in my comments, on the other hand I told you several times that your asumption are wrong. And to read again. None of this made you reconsider your own asumptions. This tells a lot.
---
Extra for you I'll quote myself and some of the relevant parts you completly missed: 
---
&gt;GW2 is no free to play MMO. **For a F2P such strategies would be ok, but not for a game for which you paid to play.**
---
&gt;Players/Customers are not a welfare organisation for gaming companies. **Players will compare quality of service to price tag** - and if other games offer a better value for your money they'll complain. 
---
&gt; sell an expansion for 30€ and people will complain if **all mount skins are shop content**. Offer the expansion for free and the same is fine, people got 30€ spare money to spend on mountskins.
---
&gt;if GW2 offers only 4-5 maps for 50€: that's 50€ for like **50h of quality content.** After doing story etc. you are **stuck with low quality content as achievement farming.** Asia grinder content you'd get for free in other games. To justify the 30-50€ price tag anet has to offer a better service than these asia grinders. 
---
&gt; Keep in mind that I'm not complaining about cosmetic shop content.
---
&gt;Value also depends on the quality of entertainment. 
---
To explain, once again: for a free to play game such a business strategy would be fair. But not for a buy to play game you already paid for. This does not mean that Anet should have no shop skins at all. 
---
That was your wrong asumption which you pulled out of your ass. All your comments are based on this wrong asumption. 
---
I tried to explain to you that it is about balance. You paid for the game and expect a better service than in a free to play. I directly told you that I'm not complaining about cosmetic shop content.
---
To repeat:
---
It's about "balance". I'm not "explaining why GW2 is such a shit game". I'm explaining the value you get for your money. Compared to elder scrolls etc. - are GW2 expansions offering very little quality content. Even compared to the core game (GW2) or GW1 expansions are GW2 expansions offering very little quality content. There aren't 20 new maps and 10 new dungeons or so. If quality content offered is low - and all mountskins are gemstore skins - then balance is off. 
---
If there would be 20 maps, 10 dungeons etc. it would be ok to have these skins shop only. Because expansions offers enough content for your money. Enough value for your money. If "real content" is falling short it is not okay if **all** mountskins are shopskins. Or if game experience improving tools as endless mining tools or copper-fed salvage are shop content only. It's about balance. An expansion has to offer something to the players. This should be content, but can also be skins, qol improvements, new ingame goals to farm/strive for as ingame achievable mount skins or an ingame achievable garden in your homeinstance. 
---
Yes, Anet needs to earn money. They can do so.
---
It boils down to either:
---
-expansions with more content, so expansions are worth their money
---
-same amount of content, but more ingame achievable skins etc. so expansions are still worth they money
---
-turn GW2 in a full free to play game (all expansions free) and keep the shop as it is
---
Currently you get small expansions. Do story once, explore all maps. How many hours? 50 is generous I'd say. Anything else is low quality content, grind content. Stuff you get for free in any asia grinder. No reason to buy the expansion. You buy expansions for  content "worth paying for". At the same time Anet runs an agressive shop - mount skins could be a nice ingame goal to keep players busy. Anet prefers to earn money with little effort. Create little content and get paid for some half an hour work for skins. Players are not that super happy about this strategy. It's a strategy companies usually do to skim of profits of a product they don't support anymore. Nothing a MMO company should do with a product they plan to support for another years.
---
If Anet wants to offer a **fair price they have to add more content.** Be it "real content" maps or "skin and qol content" as shopskins and increased bank space etc. Or Anet has to reduce the price tag of expansions to "free". I don't care. Many players left to WoW, FF etc. Because they are there getting a better value for their money. A better service. These games aren't cheap. But if service/quality is good it is worth it. GW2 has to prove that it is worth it. Because for many players it isn't anymore.
---
Now to you:
---
&gt;There's literally no way your comment can be construed other than you saying Anet shouldn't be able to monetise their non-subscription game
---
Wrong. Only the stupid are cocksure. You made a wrong asumption, are completly convinced by your own retardiation "literally no way" and base your whole comments on your own idiocy. This shows  a serious lack of intellect. You keep ranting about freeloaders and fail to grasp that **I would be ok with even an expensive subscription fee if I'd get something worth the money.** FF btw. is worth it's money - which is the reason why so many GW2 players are searching refugee there atm. https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/cg4o1c/guild_wars_2_refugees_coming_to_ffxiv/
---
All "freeloading parasites" which are happily paying 11€/month while not being willing to pay for GW2. 
---
So yeah, you should feel emberrassed. For yourself and the person you are. For the future: stick to what is said and don't pull asumptions out of your ass. Just because someone drives a red car it's not a ferrarri. If you don't understand something ask. If someone flat out tells you, that your asumptions are wrong consider that your asumptions are wrong and don't stick to them at any costs. You are just emberassing yourself. And if you escalate a situation as you did in your very first comment it's you who chooses the tone of the ongoing convo. You can try to de-escalate or even excuse yourself. Or you can keep escalating. I for sure won't soft peddle. Maybe your mom was a heavy alcoholic when she was pregnant with you. It's great that we integrate challenged people into society. But it's not my job to take your hits and not blow back. That, my dear, would be your job because you started it.
---
In a few years, when you are old enough, you'll value the lessons I tought you here.
---
One way or another, a lot of your skins will end up being "wasted" unless you constantly change your appearance.
---
You're overthinking it a bit too much.
---
I was given a verdant executor outfit. Glad it was an outfit but not my prefer style so don’t foresee using it much.
---
Raiders are mostly nice, you get a few toxic PuGs but you don't want to raid with them anyway.
---
The problem with subs is that they invent a company to provide content that gets you to resubscribe, but not to actually play. Think Gym memberships.
---
[https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/12/30/373996649/why-we-sign-up-for-gym-memberships-but-don-t-go-to-the-gym](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/12/30/373996649/why-we-sign-up-for-gym-memberships-but-don-t-go-to-the-gym)
---
In my case I could not enjoy the free content. First time I enjoyed the game was when I started the expansions. Mounts, Glider and jungle meta events are so much more fun to me than the basic game itself. Also revenant is my favorite class and you can only use it with expansion. Not to mention elite specs...
---
What are some of the best places to kill champions for the champion rush event? have you seen any good farming routes/groups doing certain areas?
---
Love that final look man, your character physically just looks more mature and weathered from dealing with the threat of the Elder dragons and Balthazar
---
That's how they work, so it makes sense. Skyscale can fly "vertically" to a higher altitude than the Griffon, if starting from the ground.
---
I think you mean horizontal distance.
---
This of it as th [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guaranteed\_Wardrobe\_Unlock](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guaranteed_Wardrobe_Unlock) is
---
Because that's the point of the word "Pack".
---
Expecting "legitimate discussions" out of twitch chat is the most characteristically out of touch statement I've ever heard Arenanet make. They really just don't understand how modern gaming media works, do they?
---
Yes, that's part of the trade-off. Griffon can't hover, can't go straight up, and can't bounce up walls.
---
Nobody "came for the Belgians" except the Belgians.
---
&gt; People still think that gw2 has no fetch quests.
---
I play since release and I never heared anybody saying something like this, but okay.
---
I've been wearing the zodiac light armor on my charr ele since release (of the armor) and have 0 desire to change it! But I have over 60 other charr that I can abuse xD 
---
Altho 2012 low res armor just doesn't stand a chance against the newer pieces, the bladed armor from HoT and the warbeast armor from PoF are pretty much my go to pieces &lt;3
---
Items for gems =/= items for gold
---
While rewards that simply cost gold are not the best either they are still much better than gemstore items.
---
Will we finally find a culinary use for bloodstone dust?
---
I got some Strawberries. Maybe i'll turn a profit.
---
We're talking about a game where probably less than 5% of the community have done fractal 100 CM. You can take braindeads into easy wings like 4 but you'll probably not do deimos. I've seen pug groups die because of shit dps players on Vale Guardian. I know people who blacklist puggers from certain guilds because they're usually bad even though they some how have the raid credentials probably because they bought it.
---
Ah yes, the much anticipated "we're going to be killing the game" announcement, an mmo classic
---
People are being pretty dishonest in here. They give you a buff that means when you kill something that gives you XP (like an open world mob) it has a chance of spawning a skritt you have to kill. When you kill it, it drops an item. That item can contain virtually any black lion store cosmetic. The item acts like a Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlocker, only there are no real "duds" like getting some 2 silver crafted weapon skin. The lowest value you can get are some dyes and cheap black lion weapon skins. On the other hand, you can also get 2k gem mount skins.
---
True, I got Bioluminescent axe, Fear dye, Icecrown and Schlerite mace which are much better drops from a random guarenteed wardrobe unlock.
---
You can make a spare character throw the stuff you wanted deleted on it, then delete the character
---
Had one spawn in wvw after taking a garrison, said it dropped something but I couldn't find it in my inventory
---
TakenFurnace? Oh you don’t say... Next time you should try mixing in some moderately realistic tidbits so it’s more believable /s
---
Okay.
---
I'm pretty sure it feels better to put things in your ass than pulling things out of it....
---
Just saying.
---
Lol, okay.
---
This sounds made up just to churn up more negativity. If you’re going to lie (don’t lie) at least make it believable.
---
This is the weakest, yet an extensive amount of effort I've seen in a while.
---
This. I've been micromanaging my unlocks to try and maximize value and it is/was annoying as hell. These things were crazy valuable. Even with a few low value rolls, I got 2x the value of gems that I put into it. 3x if you count the 2k mount skin I got. I'm seriously considering not getting keys anymore. They fucked the droprates of  Tickets. These hunting bonds have given me more value for my gems than keys ever have and that's sad.
---
"anet is considering shutting them down as they are taking more money than they make"
---
I was buying it until this.
---
Why did they ever stop with these artsy trailers and cinematics in the first place, this got me so hyped back in the day, and then they upped the quality with the godly HoT trailer, and now it degraded to in-game rendered animations...
---
Brand new account posts bait. A tale as old as time.
---
Just be specific on what nodes you have in your Home and people will come based on need.
---
Didn't we end up seeing a trailer for a mobile-style game coming out from one of the cancelled projects? Maybe they have changed their direction in regards to advertising spending.
---
Surprise mechanics. Please use the proper terminology.
---
The buff stays on until you are able to tag a skritt, it will be consumed if you manage to tag one.  So there's really no worry in wasting a bond
---
I haven’t watched yet but do they discuss why they’d end the stream right before a potential major announcement?
---
I talked to a guy in game who told me he uses tombs he gets from PvP to level all his toons. Curious how people get alot of tombs from PvP. I seem to get 1 every 4 ranks on the reward tier but that seems pretty slow. Is there another way?
---
For Exordium start hoarding Elder Wood Logs (you will need 9000 logs or 3000 Planks) &amp; 4000 Mithril Ingots. In general it's a good idea to start hoarding mats instead of selling them. You will also need 250 Amalgated Gemstones, you can get 8 of these per day for several HoT &amp; PoF metas, personally I try to get 4-5 per day (I tried doing all 8 and I didn't find it time efficient) the meta's I usually do are Doppelganger (Elon Riverlands) Forged Fire (Domain of Vabbi) followed by the Pinata (Crystal Oasis) and then Chak Gerent (Tangled Depths) &amp; lastly the Octovine (Auric Basin) which ends up with 5 gemstones and a ton of loot in less than 1,5 hours. Of course there will be more gold efficient farms out there and I don't mind farming every now and then but I think I'd go crazy if I was farming 1 map endlessly.
---
On kill effects tend to only work for wings 1/2

I saw this title and was like wait.... it's not april 1. Now I've read it and im still checking the calendar to find out if I'm in the time warp. Can honestly say I never expected that.

I absolutely loved the painterly styled trailers and cutscenes it’s sooo sad that they don’t do them anymore

Literally no new information that wasn't already posted before on the sub. But that Aion cinematic looks hella cool.
---
It would help if you specify whether you're on EU or NA servers!
---
I need to stock up as well. And here is a [link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ingredient#Other_Karma_and_Coin_Vendors) for all karma and other (coin) merchant related ingredients.
---
Wow you sure showed him with your complete lack of an argument.  Your post definitely made a difference here, yes sir.
---
This is a really great idea, completely underrated.
---
Megaman Battle Network had a similiar system...For those that remember, There was the regular ranked navi's which were usually pretty easy. Then as you continue to defeat the games (you could beat the game 4-6 times before there is no more new content) and the navi's would reach up from Alpha, Beta and finally Omega.
---
On top of that they had the time system which means that the quicker you defeat the boss, the more likely you are to be rewarded more...So you had a number of ranks (i don't remember all the tiers, but the final tier was S rank, which i believe was 10 seconds and under.)
---
So when you S rank the Omega version of the navi you usually got it's omega version Navi chip as the reward. It was a pretty sweet reward system that encourged revisiting and mastering these encounters. 
---
So ya i'm on board with your idea OP!
---
You don’t get a lot at once, you accumulate them over time. More info here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tome_of_Knowledge

You can do the Easy Weekly Opportunities solo for the most part. 
---
Trek is only 5 locations in 15 minutes, just need a character with a lot of the core map unlocked. I launch it &amp; pull all 5 up on the wiki.
---
Bounty is only 1 boss, Poobadoo, Trllia or Brekkabek. If you need help ask in mapchat before you spawn it, there might be other people that need it too.
---
Race is a bit tricky, you need to find one that a lot of people or a guild is doing. If 15 people or more including you cross the finish line in the time allotted you can talk to the guy at the end &amp; end your mission early &amp; get credit for the race. This can be done for the medium &amp; hard races too. If they are the same race you can launch one complete it, then launch the other one during the same race. You will get credit for both.
---
For medium &amp; hard trek, you only have to interact with one location to get the reward, although if you don't find all of them the guild will not get credit.
---
Played ff14 for two months and hammered through the main story before letting my sub lapse this week.   While it was a blast the endgame is subjective for each player and what they like out of a game. 
---
 Personally the combat while oldschool didn't bother me as I was a wow player in the past and the gcd is not a big deal because by level 50 you'll have your full kit and you can tap one after the other in succession.

---
&gt;advertising spending
---
Hm?
---
Of course, that's why they add it in the first place - as a new money/time/material sink.
---
Yeah, I mean I see this as some attempt to skirt around pending anti-lootbox legislation, like if it ever comes down to it, "ok, we've gotten rid of the Black Lion Chests! No more loot boxes!" But then these things are still in, and they are still loot boxes. 
---
The simple rule is this, [if you spend money] and what you get for that money is [a limited amount of RNG chances of getting something of value to you], then nothing else really matters to the definition. It doesn't matter whether the mechanisms in which you get that item are keys, boxes, button presses, or monsters killed, the point is that "paying money = getting loot."
---
How close is close enough? I got one on the 18th, but when this discount arrives i'll be almost a week
---
More fun than GW2 currently.
---
Typically I try to consider glow as a light source. Obviously not a super strong one, but you should consider how the light source would affect the shadows and highlights on various features on his face. In terms of the source of light itself, I tend to go with a small solid block of color and a kind of faded “halo” around it in a much softer style, showing the light traveling outward from the source.
---
Let me know if this helps! Or doesn’t help... I can try rephrasing if you want :)
---
Yes, it's a trial balloon attempt to package a loot box as something "other than a loot box," so that if the loot boxes come under attack, they would have a plan B. It's not that it is *worse* than previous mechanics, it's just that it's not *better,* and done in a shadier way.
---
Guessing what you might get is more fun that what you already have.
---
I think it's *just* a loot box, isn't it?
---
Did I say that? I was asking if he acknowledges a simple fact. Didn't share an opinion here. You making basel3ss assumptions is abdolutely insane.
---
*Just* give me more elite specs.
---
That and raids are the tiles I want the most
---
Maybe start worrying about that when you don't have 2k transmutation charges lol
---
You are obviously missing the point, he is saying that it's ridiculous to have no option to get skins individually without buying a pack of them, which I agree with him on.
---
&gt; They're not new content added to the gemstore, not really, its just another way to get what's already in the gemstore.
---
It exists purely as a workaround for loot boxes.
---
1. As previously mentioned save all your mats,im sure they will come in handy later
---
2. If you have enough laurels buy chests of legendary shards as often as you can (time gated) as you will need tons of those
---
3. Assuming you're doing daily fractals,  always buy your daily 2 mystic clovers so you don't have to gamble for them
---
Hope this helps
---
Missing Dual class!
---
Bundles aside, you can only acquire them through the BLC. Either as a drop, or buying them with statuettes, which only drop through BLC too.
---
It's cheese builds that prevent players from learning how to stay alive without them. This build just masks the fact that you haven't learned the class. People learn nothing about the game, taking the easy route, go into harder content, get mauled and wonder why. Or kicked out of groups and wonder why. Honestly, this isn't good for the game, even if it's less convenient for you. It's a bandaid solution for people who don't want to learn how to play. It's taking the easy way out, which admittedly some people do.
---
ya can't wait to get those teleport to a friend in twitch drops ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
missing "best community"
---
how about on another planet where the gods yeeted off to
---
Not only what you said, but can you imagine how boring a stream would be with no unruly meme-like chat on twitch as reactions to shit going on? The kind of stream that would facilitate tame and FaMiLy FrIeNdLy chat sounds like something that would be so boring I wouldn't even be able to fall asleep to.
---
Each content uses a different build.
---
Other than that:
---
* PvP: ask someone else, I don't know
---
* Fractals: [Hybrid Chronomancer](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/hybrid-chronomancer) (a support build that gives boons with good damage), or [Power Chronomancer](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer) (DPS build). Both may be a bit outdated, though, since we had changes to Chronomancers a some weeks ago and the website was updated in January, 2019
---
* Raids: [Power Boon Chronomancer](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/) (support build that gives boons and has decent damage), or [Power DPS Chronomancer](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/) (DPS-focused build that does not provide boons to the squad)
---
* PvE: Probably the Power DPS Chronomancer from Raids using the Domination trait line and greatsword, since it has ranged capabilities
---
Yeah you got 3+ years of stuff ahead of you.
---
After that though, that's up in the air right now.
---
Hey, im currently getting back into the game, my highest character is lvl 60 and the guy i made it with quit, if you wanted to pick up and play i might be down.
---
Is chrono still strong since they changed it? I know in the past it was one of the top classes to play, and am hoping to be relevant in fractals. My highest character is a 60 theif and i know i wont be playing that for pve content really sadly.
---
As a general comment, ANET make all sorts of weird decisions when it comes to monetisation and there’s no consistency.  Mount skins is probably one of the more frustrating examples of this.  
---
Most mount skins are either sold for a limited period of time or only available in a group pack.  There’s no flexibility.  It’s a very different to SWTOR where there is a ridiculous quantity of cosmetic items on their cash shop and stuff is always on sale.
---
You have enough content in the game right now to last you several years of fun. Ignore the vets, you're gonna be blown away by everything you can do.
---
At least in Fractals and Raids it's mostly fine. The update I mentioned had some nerfs but nothing game-breaking for them. Yeah, it made them a bit weaker, but the profession is still strong
---
Mystic Builds was sick, shame they stopped doing it.
---
Good luck on your survey and good luck on your Master's!

Gw2 has gone keto
---
It's basically zero effort.
---
I just wonder, why? Why even have the mob? It dies instantly and pretty much spawns with the first enemy you kill.
---
Ah yes, back when the game had promise and wasn't a giant mess with an uncertain future.
---
They won't be releasing any more PoF raids.
---
Any future raids would be Season 5 raids and have their own currency.
---
I'm not a fan of loot boxes either. The difference for me is that micro-transactions are optional to play GW2, whereas subscription models are not. I refuse to play a game that is P2W, and also one that is subscription-based. I also tend to rarely buy anything that is RNG-based as I'm not a fan of gambling. But at the same time I don't like telling others what they can do, so I prefer to let my (lack of) money do the talking.
---
Oh god, please never make me do the Scruffy fight ever again.
---
Oh hey, another hateboner bullshit post shitting on everything before it even releases.
---
&gt; Anet already said that Season 5 will be free
---
They did?
---
There was no argument there, he proved Acacia right.
---
You're complaining about this in the wrong place, most people here are blind drones that praise and worship everything ANet does.
---
How is this shitting on anything, this is just a meme on what could be announced.
---
I got the Defiant Glass Axe skin, which is like 30-40g? And I think it looks not too shabby so... cool I guess?
---
The real lpt is in the comments
---
There's always an uproar. The Hunting Bond is literally gemstore shit for cheap with the downside of it being RNG what you get and, as you said, someone will bitch and moan that the guy next to him got his sword skin for 200 gems. The humanity!
---
If its more than just a living story announcement there will be another tea time. If is just more story (with no Cantha), mount/skins, and cosmetics there will be no tea time.
---
Black Lion Chests are surprise mechanics, quite safe and moral! Just like Kinder Eggs /s
---
&gt;90% of the complaints are due to people rushing through and being done with most PvE content and are just in a "we want it now" phase
---
This is the correct take.
---
Play.   
---
This subreddit has always Loved to complain, Moan, and whine about any and everything it can. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Which is to say, some things do need some love. But, Complaining about it won't get it there any faster
---
Wack...
---
...oh, wow. Goddamn, I fucking love Anet's attention to detail. That's absolutely fantastic.
---
&gt;That's why they're technically not loot boxes in the traditional sense of the term.
---
No, they're definitely still loot boxes, they're just a *variety* of loot box. Loot boxes come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, the key distinction of a loot box is [pay money] in order to obtain a set amount of "attempts," [each attempt as a random chance of producing an item of value]. Those are the key points, money + random. It does not matter whether you "always get *something,"* and it does not matter whether the odds improve with each subsequent role. One could argue that the very last Mount License in a set isn't technically a loot box, since its contents are guaranteed, but every previous one opened still would be. 
---
The Knife Tails *are* a loot box, because you're [paying money] to [get an attempt at an RNG roll], the only "flavor" added on is that you have to kill a mob to trigger the opening of the loot box.
---
i think you mean swtor, kotor is actually a singleplayer game
---
Gemstore is not content. They can make new stuff in few days if not hours
---
Anet says lots of things.
---
Minor correction. The worst case scenario is unlocking  Raven and [Parrot Mail Carrier](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Parrot_Mail_Carrier) skins worth about 4 silver each, or dyes worth 5-9 gold.
---
Garlic's main supply is herb patches.
---
So what you're saying is people who make a big deal out of things the community at large doesn't particularly care about are not destroying the game, and people who take it in stride are? lmao
---
There's one person here who doesn't get it and it's you.
---
Randomized mount skins in loot boxes were a big deal. A big community issue. Most people didn't like them. But this?   
---
Some of us know the difference between an issue and a storm in a tea cup. I get it. You're really, really unhappy. But this change isn't a big enough change to enough people to affect much. I've already said I used the same build, I adapted. I'm doing fine. Therefore, it cant' be that big a deal because I'm certainly not the worlds best player.
---
  
---
They can't tailor the game to everyone's specific likes and dislikes because that's not realisitic. But I gurantee you people who over-react to minor changes, even if it's their one build that they like, are doing more damage to the game than "people like me".
---
One of us is being reasonable.
---
It's ascended level quality, 0 chance it's not account bound I'm convinced.
---
&gt; You thought you could just mindlessly downvote every PvP/WvW thread without repercussions? Now it's boiling over. Deal with it.
---
What does downvoting a thread have to do with anything?  If people leave the game because of that then they need to get some thicker skin.  Also, what repercussions?  If you're referring to the few small time twitch people leaving, I'm willing to be those people that downvoted the threads don't give a shit.  This sub reddit isn't some " immaculate echo-chamber of positivity," quite the contrary.  It's a toxic mess due to an extremely small minority of players.
---
Anet listens? :O
---
Because money.
---
Neither are morally good, but for the most part "clearing" loot boxes are *better* than non-clearing. I mean it's a wide spectrum of how nasty a loot box might be, but even a loot box that can only contain two possible items and on the second one you're guaranteed to get the other thing would still be *some* degree of morally bad, because it would have people gambling to get the result they prefer on the first roll.
---
It would be a new thing to announce a legendary that includes *no* gold sink.
---
Confirmed using reddit at work and skimming quick replies without thinking.
---
You could also try FFXIV .... hopefully you don't mind paying for expansions along with $30 mounts, $15 skins and I think the emotes were around $10? Add another $7 to skip the borefest that its the vanilla story just to be able to play Heavensward.
---
I still wonder what kind of "content" some people really want because we've got a bunch of different rewards from PoF and LS4, but since looks are subjective, well...
---
The thing is what you do out of it. And regarding to the announcement, they actually *DO* make content out of it.
---
Wow, calm down boy. Those bingo games are a common thing for any kind of announcements/releases. Also I don't see any "hateboner bullshit" at all. 
---
It's bingo, it's a guessing game, so calm down...
---
Can be applied to most GW2 content
---
Just go and fail Octovine, we'll see how it's so friendly ingame *bEsiDes pVp*, like that other guy said... it's the same everywhere and people pretend non-hardcore aspect of the game are so friendly but it's fake.
---
"New Loot Boxes"
---
Can I tick that one already?
---
Paying for what? There aren't any premium subscription type transactions in this game, and what do you mean by:  
---
&gt;Arena Net says he's selling the account  
---
Selling or trading any GW2 accounts is strictly against ToS and results in an instant ban if you're caught, so I don't see why Anet would be casually informing you that an account is being sold.
---
Right because they wouldn't price it at 2k a skin like the rest of the mount skins in the gem store...
---
&gt;  i dont understand how much money Anet actually thinks theyre going to make from this.
---
Much? because they do?
---
From a players point of view it's still gambling, yes and you should be clear about this when you buy those things. But since this one containes only gemstore items, it's a much better lootbox than others in the game. 
---
And from a players point of view, who don't want to buy those gambling things at all, it's still one gemstore item unlock for free.
---
Build templates please!
---
Gotta say, that's an interesting way of ripping your ex of 10 bucks a month.
---
Honest I've played WoW for 8 years. Until late Cataclysm. Even with all the criticism I can level at that expansion, it still blows anything ANet has done other than main HoT out of the water, easily. And that's the worst of the expansion I personally partook in.
---
Stating "WoW does not create good content" might work for the momentary content right now, while the game is in the process of winding down. But then if you do that, you also have to look at stuff such as Bloodstone Fen's 10m² zone, repair-the-signs story events, Scarlet Briar's early days or even worse, Theme Park Lion's Arch or the New Player Experience changes.
---
But look at the games overall, and WoW not only lived over twice as long already (an achievement GW2 can only dream of, given the current state of the game), but also produced a **ton** of amazing content. More so for the time, as they were the ones who had to figure out to how to do "modern MMO", while everyone afterwards can easily look what worked and didn't work for WoW and it's myriad of clones.
---
At least with these you don't have to roll black lion chests in hopes to get a guaranteed wardrobe unlock.  You can just outright buy these.  Think if you land on a skin worth 500, even 1000 gems, at the cost of only 2400 gems for 15 (160 gems each).. you can get by pretty cheap on some of these skins.  No it's not choice, but it's that much less for you to unlock later.
---
I'm not defending them by no means, but I would rather be able to buy these than buy keys and hope to get guaranteed wardrobe unlocks, which is hit or miss.
---
Power chrono or condi mirage, assuming pve
---
Hrm, but that boring vanilla FF14 story beats all except GW2's HoT story, so I'm not sure what to take away from that. Maybe that GW2 should sell a story skip? :P
---
Subjective, of course. I genuinely didn't like the post-Heavensward story, for example. And it seems most people love Estinien McBroody, so they dug that part.
---
Old LA. FeelsSadMan.
---
&gt; Buying 15 at 2400 gems
---
... is a mistake. :P
---
&gt; for content
---
It's not content.
---
first: that some of these items are "garbage" is your opinion. dont speak everyone.
---
second: &gt;  odds are it won't be an item you care about or want. 
---
why would you buy it then? you buy it, you are clearly okay with what you will get.
---
third: you guys have to accept, that not everyone hates lootboxes and that not everyone has a gambling problem.
---
I wouldn't be mad if they removed wardrobe unlocks from chests, and made these sellable on the gemstore in bursts (for short periods).
---
Yeah it's not "gambling mechanics used to prey upon weak-willed or easily addicted people or children" it's "surprise mechanics". Internet kids nowadays! /s
---
A 4s mail carrier is *objectively* a garbage reward.
---
A dye worth 1 gold is *objectively* a garbage reward.
---
Stop jerking ANets dick and defending gambling in videogames.
---
In general, a *loot box* is any paid premium reward where you don't know the **actual** reward you'll be getting.
---
Build templates were already announced :-P
---
You get a "Suspicious Package" if you kill someone else's Skritt without the bond active.  This immediately turns into some kind of junk item.  Maybe it could be better than a junk item, I'm not sure, but that's usually what you get.
---
He still never denied that Hunting Bonds are gambling. That's a fact, you can't deny it, no matter what you say.
---
Sure! If you ignore the *5 silver mail carriers*, and shitty &lt;2g dyes?
---
Oh wait, mentioning those completely destroys your shitty narrative here.
---
Yay, a gold star. :D
---
He never mentioned gambling at all, he just compared the hunting bond with BLC keys and wardrobe unlocks. He talked about the chances to get good things and stuff, but not about the "it's gambling" topic. 
---
You can't accuse somebody to downplay something, if it isn't even the topic of the post nor mentioned at all. If you do you could accuse him for literally anything.
---
I would give you the advice to buy the cheap items from the tp so you only get items which are worth it, so everything that is cheaper then the worth of 200 gems in gold
---
It also makes sense since you can re-use a lot of assets and overall work. It's the reason why these types of games typically have story-related dungeon-esque content. You can build your flashy set pieces and bosses for everyone to experience and then tweak numbers and add a few mechanics for the tryhards.
---
But nope, our story content comes in the form of giant open world maps that aren't worth repeating unless they're an efficient grind or you're forced back there for a collection. I guess there's always a hope for Season 5, but I'm not holding my breath for this degree of change.
---
once you have it, it replaces the other mounts in 80 percent of situations.
---
He's not wrong though, mesmers are cancer.
---
I didn't accuse him of downplaying it.
---
I literally quoted him downplaying it.
---
I would definitely agree with this approach. It's a good way to get rid of the items lower than 200 gems on the loot table. But that would also lock everything else behind like a 50$ wall.
---
Some explain the PvP Swiss to me? Just fight each other with cheese weapons or what?
---
&gt;  No chance to unlock some shitty 2 silver bandit sword skin
---
easy way to fix this: buy all skins up to 50g
---
If you ever watched it you'd know it actually is legit.
---
&gt;Why make legendary weapons but not use them?
---
Is that a common thing to do that I never heard about?
---
Sure DM your IGN and/or discord, I'll add you when I 'm back home.
---
The math has been done, it's really not that different than writs vs non-writs in terms of uptime. The DPS for the rock dog is even on the wiki and it goes up with boon overflow/vuln.
---
The whole writ uptime argument is basically at worst even with regular utility in 99% of runs.
---
Because Guild Halls are not an option I finna go with 
---
New Dungeon
---
Wow puts out a lot more content than gw2. The only time it barely got any content was during WoD (wow players got a taste of playing gw2 I guess). Their ingame reward ratio to shop ratio isn't even close to the degeneracy that is gw2.
---
To be fair, statuettes are also from birthdays.  And you can get keys for free in the game too.
---
mobile TP app
---
The entire game consists of playing the trading post for profit, if you hit 0 gold you lose
---
I'd think that a 2k gem skin does take a bit longer than only a few days.
---
Thank you for such detailed answer!
---
No fair, I can't go four corners with this setup!
---
I personally think cooldown gameplay on its own is the weakest type.  It's very one-note.  Resource management inherently makes gameplay kits *feel* more powerful by nature.
---
Most living things are happy unskinned.
---
Thanks! Might wait
---
I mean, i've been saying the same thing as far as Firebrigade having more damage/etc., but Chrono has always had the most versatility.  Also, two chronos doing 10-man SoIs back and forth makes any other boon supports twice as powerful
---
I want GW1 back :&lt;
---
That’s Brazil, he was the main guest on the show for a long time. If you don’t know him or know the dynamic of this group I could see you’d have this view. He is actually a cool guy.
---
Do People give a shit about this? We had loot boxes on Monday. We have loot boxes on Tuesday. Nothing changed
---
Depends on the staff. Give it a try.
---
I don't know what your problem is with alt characters. You must have a humonguous amount of level up scrolls and books to insta lvl80 at least 5 charas. And if you play WvW from time to time, you can isntantly unlock any elite spec you want, too.
---
But tbh, I kinda miss a funktion where I could save my fashions / save them as own outfits in order to quick swapp through them. Would be hella fun for any fashion wars enthusiast.
---
really you can even get a item if you don´t have the buff?
---
They've been doing whacky shit with gemstore items forever. They're trying out new things to see if people are interested in buying it. Were [Teal Branded Mists](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Teal_Branded_Mist) shady? They basically had the same mechanic.
---
They're trying to incorporate BLC stuff with gameplay. They've done a pretty bad job with it though, since killing random mobs until a skritt spawns on top of you only serves to slow down the reward acquisition. Granted, maybe that was the actual goal?
---
I think that as a gaming community we need to give a shit about it. You can't just focus on one game doing it expecting for it to change for the entire gaming genre. 
---
It's like climate change. You've had it on monday, on tuesday, nothing changed. Doesn't mean you should stop giving a damn. Reason for comparison: they're both recent and very important in their own aspect of life - climate a.k.a. nature and entertainment - gaming.
---
I know some people don't really care about the loot boxes because you can just decide whether you want to spend money on it or not. So I'll give you that.
---
Caring about animations xD
---
you only get a junk item worth some coppers as far as I know
---
proud 2 be kurdick
---
Statuettes were their attempt at that. As was the preview window on black lion chests.
---
These are disabled in Belgium as seen in other topics, so I kind of doubt this was their "loophole" attempt.
---
You mean the ones where you can take a dropped item and bring them back to the NPC?   You mean an optional thing you don't have to actually do to complete the heart?
---
Well, my rates so far are pretty bad. I haven't been able to bring myself to hardcore grind it, so i only have 8 boxes, and at buy price, they were worth 4g in total (got some orbs, some t4/t5/t6 mats). Making it about 50 silver per box. And I've probably been averaging 3 boxes an hour (15 champs an hour, which is pretty low, but thats my rates so far). Most of the gold I've been getting has been coming from Champ loot/trash drops. So this is really no better than the traditional champ farm, with a slight incentive by giving people a 0.00001% chance to get something super rare.
---
I mused that idea a while back and people did not like it.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/btx2ea/zhaitan_as_a_raid_boss/
---
Use 1.. kill stuff until a skritt appears, kill skritt.. get loot box.. buff goes away.  RNG on what skin you unlock from the loot box.
---
If they wanted to do that they would have released one of those really good 2k gem skins that all the other mounts have. Even the WvW mount is neglected u_u
---
If GW2 was a game that anybody outside of this sub remotely cared about, or thought was relevant, they would be all over the monetization in this game because it's one of the most consistently awful out there. Almost everything is a lootbox, random or extremely overpriced for a lack of effort. The game has been gutted for years in terms of in-game rewards to prop up the gemstore, which makes playing the game kind of pointless if you have even a passing interest in earning new skins.
---
People are getting super salty about the Apex Legends axe at the moment, but how is that any worse than mount adoption or this new 'key quest bond random items' bullshit they've just added to the game? ANet are a terrible company for this shit, but the community here almost begs to be taken advantage of with how many people constantly come to bat for ANet's shady monetization strategy.
---
Is hard to say but community dont like chrono in fractals and every single time balans change something in chrono do you need a lot to learn. Is my main still Play chrono,is funny anyway. Is easier to show you than write 20 pages ;) write to me on tye game (misio.8625)
---
At least this way you don't have to roll multiple keys to get 1..
---
It’s a lot of work, but it’s worth it for many reasons. Only at 12.5k from a year of playing, but I’ll hit 39k eventually.
---
Its there, it even got QoL updates this year. Want it, then go play it. :\\
---
They're always trying things. Besides, it's not Belgium they're worried about, it's if places like the US or EU overall get into the action. The idea is to get players accustomed to different forms of lootboxes, so they can leave in whichever ones the specific laws might fail to address.
---
So you have to kill Skritt? Where do you find them? or is it completely random spawns?
---
This is interesting, because as someone who has lead training raids, commanded raids with pugs, and joined many raids as a pug, this has not been my experience *at all*.
---
Lunar event is very cool, firework filling the skies with colours , love it.
---
There's a flood of people faking KP. nobody wants to deal with that shit.
---
Aha! but have you considered that they're just an innovated new form of quest? Anything a game offers you to is a quest. Quests are just goals with structures and rewards.
---
If you don't like it, call it a fetch quest, because "fetch" in that term has no meaning anymore. It just means a quest you don't like.
---
Hard to actually argue with someone when they have the reading comprehension of a pineapple.
---
&gt; It's **basically** zero effort.
---
As you already mentioned, a mob has to be killed.
---
Which seems enough effort for some to complain about it on reddit.
---
is there a new potion like the one that makes candy corn giants? but skritt?
---
GW2 mobile should be there somewhere, why else have the announcement at PAX?
---
Can the "Free!" square count as "none of the above"?
---
Where's multiclassing? :p
---
But u have a new lootbox, dont worrt about gameplay
---
Meh, in general I prefer polishing existing content over adding new one in long-running MMOs, partially because I always have tons of things I've not looked at, and I wouldn't play the MMO if I didn't enjoy it's core gameplay loop even on repeat. So I am more than happy if the core gameplay is honed and perfected constantly.
---
But yeah, different strokes and all. I can see why someone would want "just more!", so there's new stuff to play with.
---
Still nothing to say than insults? You should end this conversation or your little "revolt" won't end well.
---
I'm pretty sure Anet said that they want to move away from expansions and introduce systems or content like elite specs trough living world episodes, so the most realistic idea would be getting one or two elite specs per episode? Probably 1 but I think 2 might be smarter.
---
I apologize for that harsh first impression. You are probably right yeah it was my first time watching them together. I felt boots was a bit excluded :(
---
Skritt spawns only if someone with active Hunting Bonds (that item from gemstore, first one is free) kill a mob. Everyone can see the skritt and everyone can kill it.
---
Skritt always rank 1 with shiny title.
---
Elite specs bring new gameplay. I believe this should be included in the "new this and that".
---
Can I play or is that technically cheating? ;-)

10 man SoI is disgusting and should not be in the game due to the fact that it pushes having multiple 10 man sois to cover boons, same goes for alac 10 man renegade removing the necessity of having a chrono all together in favor for quickbrand.
---
You are making a mistake:
---
Not every sentence that starts with "But seriously..." or "Realtalk here:" or "Hot take:" is actually correct. The people on the podcast said what they think, which is nice, but doesn't help them if what they think is not good. Sometimes, the critics are wrong, you know.
---
But that isn't my complaint about the stream, I honestly don't care much about their opinion as long as they are able to defend it - which in general they could.
---
What I care about is the attitude of certain guests on the stream towards other members of the community. I remember one guy telling the story on stream how he got banned for flaming his raid squad for being terrible and throwing bombs at the cage at trio to sabotage them.
---
What was the reaction? "Lol" "xDDDD" Not: "What the fuck is wrong with you? What kind of person does something like this?" There they laughed, everyone, at how this might not be nice, but maybe the squad deserved it, how "the casuals" are ruining the game, everyone who calls them "toxic elitist" is just a bad person in general and has no clue what the game is really about...
---
This was a really telling moment for me. It reminded me of a certain political faction I dislike. For me, the stream was good content, but I couldn't stand their discussions. All this "real talk" was just a cover for blatantly wrong and offensive opinions, not just criticism about the game, but also really unfair to huge portions of our community.
---
I must add that I've never seen Teapot really engage in such toxic behavior, but he at least tolerated that his guests do it. I wouldn't have invited certain people back time and time again. But yet he did, so this is on him as well.
---
Yeah I get that. But what you're asking is do you want a meal with everything or just the appetizer that comes with the meal with everything. If it's a given that elite specs come with an expansion then who'd going to say they want elite specs, when they get those with an expansion anyway. I mean do you want an expansion with elite specs or just elite specs is sort of what you're asking. Unless you're asking if we want an expansion without elite specs, which is a different question. 
---
The way you phrased it, I'd rather have an expansion.
---
Do you, by any chance, know how long does the bond last? I assume it expires, but wiki doesn't say a word on the duration.
---
Good thing I always played solo and love hero build crafting
---
Gold to gems is a very definition of a predatory practice. 
---
People farm gold to gems, prices of gems go up. Then you have desperate people that will throw thousands at the gem conversion to get some easy gold.
---
Anet isn't losing any money on this,those gems don't appear out of nowhere, they are already paid for by  the people, usually the one with addiction problems, that will spend thousands just to get everything game has to offer.
---
What could be a new feature/content that completely surprises us and never be done before? Like other than the expected map specialization story fractals etc. I’m trying to brainstorm can’t think what mmo could offer that’s revolutionary again. Maybe like a pve castle siege with an army in open world? Or like an in game concert? I dunno haha
---
You forgot a new table
---
Too late got 2 mount skins and a glider for 600  gems instead of 1200 gems. I hate lootboxes and gambling too but i'd be ok with anet replacong blacklion chest with these bonds.
---
Lets go! :)

---
&gt; Yeah, I mean I see this as some attempt to skirt around pending anti-lootbox legislation, like if it ever comes down to it, "ok, we've gotten rid of the Black Lion Chests! No more loot boxes!" But then these things are still in, and they are still loot boxes. 
---
Oh it very much is a preparation for the shitstorm that is about to unleashed. 
---
Just like some countries have laws that only slot machines with "skill element" are allowed. This is literally the same thing, a loot box with some "skill element" that can be used as an excuse in the future.
---
&gt; less then a month
---
Nah. The nerf would happen near the end of Season 5. Right before new Expansion/Season announcement.
---
Meanwhile in PoE things are up in the store 24/7, and are not locked behind artificial scarcity. And you can even buy separate armour pieces if you don't want the whole set.
---
I will use the free one I get because I paid for the base game and the two expansions (do I get 3 bonds for that or only one? I guess only one) and I won't buy any with gems. 
---
Out of curiosity, do you get a free one if you are living in Belgium and bought the base game or one of the expansions? That could indicate if ArenaNet think the bonds are a valid way to bypass anti-gambling laws.
---
Ok but its still a random spawn or it spawns every time someone with the bond kills a mob?
---
I'm just happy to be a chef again ^-^
---
It seems like it might be more interactive than just standing at the station and cooking, which makes my inner chef a very happy person
---
At the moment it's the one topic gamers rally behind. Which means there is no sense to the criticism since most have never actually though about the topic. So you get the whole range from full RNG drop tables to simple microtransactions considered as "loot boxes".
---
None if these. Curb you expectations to avoid disappointment.
---
They can't possibly announce an expansion it will take a minimum of 1.5 years just to get through living story it they are released every 3 months. To which we know ist always the case, sometimes later.
---
Making people wait 1.5 years to 2 years will be dreadful unless they have a constant feed of information flowing and little testing betas and unrevealing streams like they did for HoT
---
I’m thinking the same thing. Straight down the middle.
---
As far as I remember, it lies in unavailable part of Arah. WP made a retrospective video about this trailer, but I can't link it now.
---
Some bloke once wanted me to ping LI despite showing Envoy's Herald because "you can buy titles". Sure, I can buy 750 LIs for the title, but I can't buy the 250 or whatever he was asking for. Honestly don't wait to be kicked from squads like that, just press the leave button yourself.
---
Anet is near the top of an admittedly steep, slippery hill with a pile of cash at the bottom of it. You think their monetization is bad? Sure, things are on the overpriced side, but like...have you played runescape in the last year? Lootboxes, shoved in your face every fuckin day, non-cosmetic rewards from them to the point that actually training your skills is pretty heavily devalued in terms of your sense of accomplishment, a new "promo" every week, AND this is on top of the monthly subscription cost.
---
I have 13000 hours of playing time logged on runescape and even making an ascended piece of armor on gw2 gives me more of a sense of accomplishment than anything ive done on runescape in the last...maybe year or so.
---
Try to take comfort that anet's monetization **REALLY** is not that bad (obligatory "yet").

&gt; Hello everyone,
---
&gt;
---
&gt;We’ve made a lot of progress on the fixes needed to get Automated Tournament stability to a place where we feel comfortable having Monthly tournaments again, however we’re not there yet. It remains our plan that once monthly tournaments are back, we will hold them on an accelerated scheduled until we’ve caught up.
---
&gt;We won’t be clearing qualifying points until we hold a “monthly” tournament, so there is no fear that you’ll lose the work you’ve done to qualify. 
---
&gt;Thank you for your patience.

---
&gt; The part of the community that really wants to try and is invested into the game, has gotten smaller and smaller.
---
It's impossible to get decent pug raid clears anymore, after the disappointment of w6 and 7. Average clear times on reset day with any group went from about 3 hours to 6-8. 
---
So many players were lost, it's just a waste of time trying to pug raids now.
---
&gt; It’s the same as Legendary stuff,
---
Legendary armor/weaps/trinkets are all one-time purchases. It's a significantly different ballgame when you're dealing with consumables.
---
Be honest, when is the last time you've seen someone craft one of the feast versions of writs? Hell, how often have you seen feasts of regular meta food (like the 100 power 70 ferocity one)? It simply doesn't happen, because they're outrageously expensive and there aren't any one-size-fits-all foods that work with every build.
---
Yes, that coupled with "predatory business practices" gets shouted around endlessly. Always without any actual definition or sources. And naturally, always specifically against the things the poster doesn't like. With a handy text at the ready why his personal preference is totally different. (See trading card games for example)
---
at least some update that they working on it
---
They want to be able to put advertisements in the chat.  I guarantee it.
---
So yet another "end" with no risk of him leaving ...
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I think we differ in that you blame the content for being too hard, whereas I blame the long content droughts.
---
Both, really. The drought certainly didn't help. w5 wasn't really "too hard", it was just too unfair. Let me give you two examples with Soulless Horror and Dhuum:
---
SH: Suddenly, you needed 2 Chronos who can tank. In smaller guilds, usually one Chrono tanked all the time, with the other off-chrono being generally a bit worse at the game or a bit more demotivated. Don't think with a hardcore attitude you'll have that problem.
---
Dhuum: Tanking, Greens, Kiting, Shackles. If you had one or two "bad" players, you could get good shackle RNG and they'll never get it and you'll kill Dhuum easily; if they got it you wipe. That made the fight very random to complete due to the frequency of shackles happening (~10 times). If the number of "bad" players was too high because of replacements, suddenly Dhuum becomes much harder, if you had bad RNG and the wrong people got shackles, well.... Again, not a problem HC guilds have I think. The important part here is not that shackles are hard or something, the important part is that you can kill Dhuum flawlessly one week and fail around the next. The next is greens: It isn't hard, but it will insta wipe you. And greens depend on your connection. In smaller guilds, if the better players had bad internet... they just couldn't do it even if they wanted to.
---
That's how the higher skill variance affected groups in w5. It's not because it was "too hard", but that the difficulty partly came from aspects that these guilds struggled with to begin with: Mechanics that wipe you if one person fucks up, and filling roles with good, not burnt out players (every week).
---
Lead to some ugly scenes and frustration, let me tell you that...
---
Anyways, I appreciate your responses. Hope you didn't take any of that ("you dont have that problem lul") as talking down to hardcore guilds, it certainly wasn't. I just wanted to point out the smaller differences that just drowned in the discussion.
---
Look at how long it took to release 1 legendary weapon, 1 elite spec every 3/4 months would be generous at best :x
---
Every time someone asks this question, I remember the guy in the forums who furiously complained about why the Swiss were getting tournaments while the rest of the world doesn’t.
---
Honestly if it is modelling a new armor yes,changing the materials is pretty light work especially if they have a production pipeline it will take longer for the concept than to final product .
---
Just tell us if there is a bingo or not :wink:
---
Money I guess, trailers and cinematics cost tons of $$.
---
Bing?
---
Microsoft take over Anet confirmed!
---
I can tell you this around 9:45am pacific time on the 30th of August. 😜
---
Tell that to my rimworld prisonners.
---
It was somewhat magical because on the build up to gw2 all we had was concept art. That trailer where divinities reach shows as artwork then transitions into a 3d model was amazing. I know the side by side talking cutscenes didn't age well but I do love how the game has some parts painted with some live 3d models mixing in.
---
Well, it was part of the reason it was met with negativity anyway.
---
Chef 500, let's make em ascended cookies
---
In term of gliders  , I'm a SAB fan so definitely SAB gliders (cloud and the wings)
---
For outfits , i wish the new one was added to it (I man can hope haha) either way I'm totally into nostalgia in these things ... so GW1 armors outfits. dervish - vabbi elementalist - monk.
---
Weapons are a tough choice ... I already have tons of them. I was a dervish fan in GW1 so I would say the suntouches scythe ! but really not that much class fit that skin... Or emissary's staff too if you don't have the emissary scythe yet.
---
&gt; How so? It would be the same as it is now.
---
I assume it would be more expensive to make
---
What did he contribute? Created guides for raids, cultivates the raiding community and creates the most viewed GW2 twitch content. Not to mention the greatest GW2 event (ERP) that has yet to be beaten by any other GW2 event. Seems to me you just don't know him well enough  to understand.
---
The crab is the mastermind.
---
The nike banner has a successor...
---
It would be 1200 like all licenses that let you choose.
---
More like left to right
---
And I think you're some sort of Blizz d-riding idiot. You're literally defending a system they copied and pasted from D3, defending weak open world content that lasted less than a month, and defending a sub fee for a game that should have died 10 years ago. Congrats. The only thing I can really somewhat agree with is Raid releases, but they overtune them so that world first guilds actually have a challenge. More than half of the population is so bad at the game that LFR is closest they will ever get to an actual raid and thats the real reason why it takes most guilds more than a month to clear raids.
---
Armchairs are always happy!
---
Add yeast before cooking
---
you mean new outfit as mist stranger or the noble courtier
---
Yea I don't know him because the only lasting impression he has left is because he only complains. And "twitch content" when speaking about gw2 is just not relevant.
---
You confuse complaining and criticizing...
---
&gt; I'm pretty sure Anet said that they want to move away from expansions
---
I'm pretty positive they said this and made a huge mistake. They moved a ton of devs off GW2 onto other projects. At that point its not possible to make a expansion with the amount of devs they have. With NCsoft forcing their hand they now have all their dev power back. They *have* to be working on a expansion now with how many they have working full time on GW2. 
---
To top: Its too soon for a expansion. If they do announce one it will be in the next 9-12 months. At minimum I expect the announcement to contain Build Templates and new Elite specs.
---
For me I usually reskin my ascended. And keep leggies in the bank or on alts. Hate going through that menu to swap stats, so much faster to spam click everything in my inv. So for me, leggies r just skins too and nothing more.
---
To be fair those nodes are not enough in my opinion. We can find full home instances with gem store nodes and those that you can even buy on TP.
---
If you want to invite ppl then say them is not full.
---
Personally i would not "love" being invite into a only story nodes home if i was looking for a full home.
---
Is an unfair and expencive system unfortunally
---
It's not that bad, you just have to be on the American servers if you wanna meet up with others usually.
---
Did a W5 the other day, had to LFG for a pug to fill DPS. We were kinda lax with the whole KP thing and only asked for LI and "be exp". The guy pinged a load of it, plus LD and legendary armor and stuff (it was suspiciously excessive).
---
Anyway we were at the Eyes of Dhuum, and the guy didn't know how to get from the checkpoint to the Eyes. We waited a really long time for him to start moving, thinking at first he had a bad loading screen, to thinking he was fixing his build, to eventually asking "are you coming?" and he says "can one of you show me the way?" Fastest kick ever
---
Yes I'm aware a lot of the population is bad, and they still play a game that has so much raid content. Which system are you referring to from d3? M+? If yes, it doesn't matter where its from if its good and it provides longevity for both casuals and hardcore players.
---
The raids are not overturned except maybe the first week, and the issue often is due to the fact that the last boss is never tested on mythic by the public.
---
Idk if you think that bad guilds take longer than a month to clear because you're talking about hc, but many good guilds definitely take more than a month to clear on mythic especially if they only raid 9 hours a week because the content is appropriately tuned.
---
Also for what it's worth, I've played gw2 longer than I played wow, but mostly for wvw. After starting wow, I saw how much time I wasted on gw2 and I'm sorry I didn't start earlier.
---
Meanwhile in wvw
---
Omg take a look how wg (wargaming) sells things and come back and tell me anet is the worst.
---
That's just plain old trying to make a fool out of judges (and legislators). They don't like this one bit.
---
The skill element has to be related to getting more/what you want, and that still isn't happening here. Everybody knows it. That shit won't save anet. And to be honest, their scummy practices annoy me so much. That they are even trying, I mean.
---
The wiki has a lot.
---
Anet needs to add public counters for boss kills so i can stop hoarding tokens and can make all the gold raid statues tbh.
---
I can't be the only one who sees this video format as big cringe.
---
Sadly, I don't.
---
Kookoochoo storyline!
---
Why would you make a level 80 character open bags? :thinking:
---
Teapot leaving? Well, shit.
---
Well, I'm currently sitting at 7 LI as I've just crafted my second leg armor set. Would have been fun.
---
Because it is, for the purposes of proactively dodging around any upcoming laws regarding loot boxes. Same as the black lion statuettes (oh it's not gambling. The random items are a bonus, you're actually paying for the guaranteed trash). They're experiencing with different delivery options. Anet are not beyond using predatory monitisation. They're not the worst company out there by far, but they're no saints.
---
Are we getting an expansion? If not, then they might want to change the wording of the article because it is extremely misleading.
---
&gt;  we will hold them on an accelerated scheduled until we’ve caught up 
---
What does this mean? It won't be a "monthly" thing anymore if this is what I think it means.
---
I'd like to see new items added, and different events. I'm not even doing this years events because they're just all the same. I hate repetitive content.
---
Amen.
---
How the fuck can you mess it up with a kinder egg?
---
Because, just like the government, they want us all to be broke and spending our last dollar on gambling. Just look at chuck-e-cheese, it's practically training kids to gamble. Just like the gemstore in GW2. Spend all your money on gems to buy skins and things you never end up using, but in the moment you just 'have to have it'. I have so many skins I bought with gems that I never even used.
---
How else are they gonna sell expansions on power creep?
---
&gt;There's a flood of people faking KP.
---
Uh huh......
---
We announce new raids *ticks the box*
---
5 minutes later a sunglasses wearing guy in a suit goes on stage an whispers something to the host.
---
I have to inform you that raids have been cancelled.
---
BINGO
---
reddit: *overreacts about everything*
---
also reddit: "to prevent backfire"
---
The only thing they repeat saying is no monthly Fee (subsciption) b2play is still an Option for s5
---
Wow, I'm so with you. Casuals who don't raid are the toxiest of the bunch and make helpful feedback impossible. 
---
Keep dying to the same mechanic? No problem. 
---
Raid leader: "xx and yy happens at 00:zz, you'll spot it if you watch the blabla glow and won't go down".
---
Casual: "wow you toxic fark" ( o\_o) surprised pikachu kick.
---
Casual whisper: "@#%#$\^$&amp;&amp; toxic mather @#$@#$"
---
We will release a new raid before christmas *ticks the box*.
---
5 minutes later a sunglasses wearing guy in a suit goes on stage anD whispers something to the host.
---
it doesnt matter what you say -people think is predatory and so it is, whatever and whoever said agaisnt it. In the end -it make money for anet so its good for game, stupid people get poor for spending money they shouldnt? if you ban that in game, they spend it elsewhere -there is reason why many poor stay poor even if given chance to get better. And my favorite is when some country say "ok people want these to be banned so we ban them" and then go full suprise pikachu faces when they cannot get those anymore.
---
people want everything fast and cheap or best for free and noone actually think this game cost money to run. Money which are created by BL content - and no story no raids no pvp make money for anet. We really get entitled as fuck ....
---
(to clarify i agree with you and disagree with most around here)
---
&gt; want to buy 1 skin for 2,000 gems instead of 5?
---
because the 2k gem skins usually come with unique models not based on the default one, and also have unique sounds and effects.
---
Not totally convinced though. :P
---
so what are the **extra steps** that were metnioned?
---
real question -how would you want for anet to pay for people and servers and everything, if they stop givin shiny "predatory" things on gemstore? by good will?
---
People who think there will be expansion announcement on august 30 should get an IQ test asap.

---
you forgot new minis through the miniature claim tickets, they have the same minis for such a long time
---
I was so tempted to but at that point it was worth staying just to see how ridiculous things would get! It probably helped that I had some wine to make things more entertaining.
---
&gt; What is the benefit of doing it now and replaying it during the double xp weekend perhaps? 
---
Heart of Thorns has some of the best meta events in the game, so it won't be too hard to find people to play with. If I were you, I'd do the story and a little exploring then rampage through the meta events with the bonus event on. If you have LS3, crack on through that too and then into Path of Fire and LS4 to unlock things (and also the story is good).
---
Get as many HoT mastery points as you can in advance. You need 144 HoT mastery points to get everything and the game is quite generous with them at the start. The story unlocks a lot for you. HoT has a lot you can unlock quite easily (lots of "go here and activate a thing" ones and Dragon's Stand has a few tied to exploring the map).
---
You can get a few from joining a raid training group and basically doing what you're told as a few of the bosses have mastery point rewards. 
---
PoF "only" has 102 for a full completion, but that's including all the LS4 stuff and the mastery points are all semi-easy to get. Path of Fire also has a *much* lower experience requirement for its masteries than Heart of Thorns, so if you want to be efficient head to the Maguuma Jungle instead of the Crystal Desert for the event. 
---
You don't *need* all masteries unlocked, but you will need some to progress (the game tells you which ones and when) and the glider ones make life easier (as well as being necessary if you want to raid).
---
Man if I dont hear something about wvw alliances i think itll be the end for me. Its the only content i enjoy in gw2.
---
Heres to wishing everyone luck that its something substantial at least!
---
They're part of the description? You could argue they make it "even worse" I guess but clearly the original sin here is that it's a loot box, and that's what every single comment is talking about too.
---
&gt;I would definitely agree with this approach. It's a good way to get rid of the items lower than 200 gems on the loot table. But that would also lock everything else behind like a 50$ wall.
---
And those things wouldn't be locked otherwise?
---
gw2 immortals hahahahhaha
---
yea and unlike necro, firebrand is extremely strong in those game modes you don't play and has been since forever
---
isn't gw2 balance fun?
---
I definetly agree on that 250 number thing but not on the collection itself. It feels like some players just want to have everything instantly without doing anything. 
---
Thats just my opinion, no hate or anything! :)
---
Contact EOD.

I fucking LOVED that post. He was so indignant , and took it so seriously.
---
NO CAPES!
---
I bet this is their way to preempt legislation.
---
Should countries decide to rule lootboxes illegal, they can say "Ah but see, the boxes of random rewards are dropped ingame **and** you buy a one-shot access to a special mob you can fight!".
---
Which sounds even more scummy to me :(
---
Stupid, non native or troll. Sometimes it's hard to tell. Anyway, nothing makes sense.
---
I think you should learn that an mmo is and will be time consuming.
---
I for one liked the skyscale collection. It made have a bond with that little bundle that i raised and trained to ride it. It was a journey for my char. One that i had to work for.
---
Everyone always complains with how fast they blast through content in gw2 but then when something takes them more than a week to acconplish they whine too.
---
Guardian is anets golden boy, if anything ever gets close to outclassing it they get nerfed into the ground
---
I'm not from America, but I remember reading that it's about strict laws regarding inedible components inside or mixed into edible goods.
---
That is, Kinder Joy is finde - it separates into two halves, one with the toy, one with the sweet. Kinder Eggs, where the toy is **inside** the egg, that's illegal.
---
Not going to happen and shouldn't happen. Better go ahead and exhale. If you want to know exact drop rates, go make a game.
---
You mean the option that people complained about more than any other?
---
you only had 2 years to save up 250 of each materials how dare they /s
---
Who cares? Get the skin that looks best to you. Getting a skin just because it has more dye channels is stupid.
---
Because it is a gambling box! And giving such things out for free is to get people hooked on.
---
Anet also said Guild Wars 2 takes everything we love about Guild Wars 1 and puts it into a persistant world.
---
You've made it so easy that it feels like cheating.
---
Which ones are your favorite?  That's not giving away anything, right!?
---
actually no its not -in belgium its blocked as are BL chests
---
Yes.
---
ArenaNet would like to sell you all of the skins, even the ones you're not particularly excited about.
---
The easiest way to do this is with lootboxes. But with lootboxes being viewed as less acceptable both in this game and in gaming in general, they're trying out a new method that has you buy all five skins you would have received in five lootboxes, including the one you want most and the one you want least.
---
Pro: It's not random. You get exactly what was advertised.   
---
Con: It's 2000 gems.
---
Hold up, I was just joking anet wtf
---
Oh, interesting. Well maybe it's still feeling out the waters in that regard, just a bit late then.
---
&gt; As proven by the fact that they're not available in Belgium,
---
"Belgium" isn't some absolute arbiter of reality. They just have their own laws to work with. If they give something the ok, that doesn't mean that it's 100% fine, and just because ANet chooses to not *offer* something in Belgium, that doesn't necessarily mean that it definitely *would* be illegal there, just that they don't want to risk asking. 
---
Belgium is Belgium, and unless you live inside Belgium, that's about all there is to that, but various other countries will also be looking into which loot boxes they will or will not condone, and under what circumstances, so it's worth it to companies like ANet to brainstorm new concepts that might slip though.
---
Unless they wanted to do the right thing and just abandon loot box mechanisms entirely, of course. 
---
And also, just so you're aware, gambling for cosmetic items is no less gambling than gambling for non-cosmetic items. It's a distinction with no difference.
---
I completed all content they released in the last 8 months in a few hours on a single day. BFA is a content wasteland.
---
The only place where they provide more content than GW2 is raids.
---
I think the collection for the roller beatle was much better as this one no idea if I will ever finish it
---
Mount Ability 2
---
I got the new Crystal dye that's so far only available from the Kralky Dye kit. Goes for 140g on the Trading Post - could've been way worse for a freebie from the Gemstore.
---
Still not realy a fan since it's just a method to hide a lootbox. But it's definitely better than a BL chest.
---
That’s tricky...
---
I’m gonna have to go with “Free!”  I can also confirm that everyone who plays BINGO will be able to use this space. 😜
---
750 bosskills are enough to show that someone is a dedicated raider.
---
Definitely not the same people. While the initial timegating was questionable it personally didn’t bother me at all. 
---
I like these bigger “quests” you can do.  They feel meaningful and I like that I have to invest some time into them. 
---
And I don’t understand OP whatsoever. Not in the same position as him but I also don’t have much time for GW2 atm, still managed to get the skyscale 1 day after you were able to complete the last collection. 
---
I’m not saying the game should make people go full nolife ( and I doubt it ever will tbh ) but a bit more stuff like this that keeps you working on something is definitely appreciated in my opinion.
---
   
---
🤔
---
Griffon is mostly expensive; if I could have replaced that by timegated/longer collections, I would have. Farming/earning gold seems way more boring to me than travelling all over the different maps.
---
Content like this is awesome since it adds replayability for the old maps everyone had already forgotten about a month since they had released.
---
Even if it's the only box checked i'm satisfied.
---
What grind ? 
---
A fair few played saved up materials expecting another aurora for one. And vision didn't come til the next week.
---
Only if you're assuming Acacia is completely and absolutely incapable of communicating their point correctly, and actually did mean that GW2 hearts aren't quests.
---
I go on snowcrows, spend my time and hard earned moni on gearing. Start learning the basic rotation. Patch hits, chrono changed. Me be like 😞. Repeat every few months. (Yes my brain is pretty afk so I don't learn chrono fast enough, stop judging me)
---
which is the only thing worth doing on youtube and media in general
---
After logging in so many accounts, do you ever get that connection error saying check your firewall settings, blah blah blah?  Then after so much time has passed you can login fine again?
---
https://i.imgur.com/kI9E8kh.png
---
Do the time sinks first. Get obsidian shards/make clovers and start on the Gift of Battle WvW track. You don't have to really play WvW, just doing dailies for some weeks will get you enough xp flasks; you'll need 80 for the full reward track. And don't forget to 100% jungle or desert.
---
No, free should be unlocked and buying them blocked, that's how it is in other games like overwatch (you can earn boxes while playing but can't buy them)
---
Yeah, if they're gonna insist on branded everything, why not make a dragon minion mount pack and take it out of the chill ones?
---
People are always gonna whine.
---
yea dude just carry your pugs into avoiding blacks at deimos, press special action for them at xera, jump samarog wave for them etc.
---
just carry 4head!
---
Oh, the time isn't the problem with the apples. I believe you can do this in one day, if you hop instances. Don't they also respawn? The problem there is that doing this 100 times is extremely boring, and at least for me a lot more boring than collecting any of the map currencies for the saddle.
---
Not to crash the negativity here, but it does say it only spawns for enemies that rewards experience in the tooltip, so basically for whatever reason it's not working correctly.
---
It is NOT a necessity, but comes with a bit of qol, it's grindy to get / not all pulled through the grind to get it and it looks cool.
---
I'd say that's something I'd call a prestige... just like a legendary weapon /armor / trinket.
---
Feel free to disagree, anyway.
---
HoT had the best trailers
---
I wish they'd introduce a new weapon type or two, tbh.
---
Exactly. It feels like you achieved something. Same as the t1 and t3 legendary weapon collections. It's a journey and an accomplishment
---
[removed]
---
&gt;People complaining about TT maybe listen to the first 5m
---
that's exactly why there is no point catering to these people, they are gonna see what they want to see and nothing is going to dissuade them from doing so, especially not the truth.
---
&gt; it's a fucking game
---
*Continues to rage on internet about a bunch of pixels*
---
Most likely just another living story, only real big announcement this game gets.
---
Yeah, Edna Modes says no capes, so we’re not allowed.
---
What in the bonds arent they selling, what is exclusive to them to the point that you have to buy it if you want that specific item?
---
I would love to have GW1 in mobile, the controls are almost perfect for it as they are.
---
Seeing your edit, I appreciate your efforts to judge my content. Thank you.
---
My wish: an expansion without new elite specs. Instead of creating even more specs, put that effort into making the existing onces that have been neglected for quite a while more interesting.
---
My expectation: none of both anytime soon.
---
What happens if he spawns in WvW and a Zerg is running over it and kills it before I could do damage? Getting nothing and wasted gems?
---
Not like you're legally bound to get it done. And don't people already complain about lack of things to do? 
---
Yeah they could make the grind more fun, it will still be grind either way.
---
I once asked him in person and he says he mostly stopped it because viewer interest for eg Cantha lore was too low at that point and he'd rather get back to specific lore once it becomes relevant in GW2. Which he did do throughout PoF.
---
Casinos are already under the gambling regulations. Belgium now just recognises lootboxes as gambling. 
---
Since gambling is illegal for minors and videogames don't have enforcement on age restriction (PEGI is only a recommendation), videogames that involve gambling are now illegal.
---
Make the game optimized for multiple core CPUs instead of single core would be lovely
---
Their fans use words like “legit”.
---
Got a dye worth 29g unlocked from the free one they gave me. Hard to complain about something that is free, but had I spent gems for it - nah.
---
Of course you have the players who unlocked the 2000 gem Jackal skin.  Some win, some lose.
---
But if you're like me and you dont buy BL keys, I see no reason to buy these either.
---
I don't anymore. It is all Mirage now.
---
Is it toxic if its true?
---
Fractals and Dungeons are enough
---
If anything this might put people off buying keys - these are much better.
---
Yes, because casinos are following the law and don't accept minors. Unlike videogames.
---
Gambling in videogames is totally legal if it has age restriction.
---
Ye and it’s too much hassle learning new mechanics for casuals so please no new content. 
---
And casuals don’t have no time to grind so only gem items from now on. And they should give the fractal chests upon joining the fractal too, cuz waiting for completion is anti-casuals. They might need to log off during completion right?
---
Raids destroyed guilds? That's a new one.
---
More dungeons. Fractals. New race. 
---
And delete toxic raids.
---
If you want to fit 3 years of content into two weeks, you are just crazy. Even by farming it 24/7 you won't finish everything. 
---
After finishin Season 2, you will be perfectly ready to start with Heart of Thorns, I would not wait. Go do the story, stay on maps only as story dictates (you need certain masteries to continue). There will be bunch of players anyways, but probably not too many. You can keep the total exploration for laters, many map parts are not accessible until you have more masteries anyways. HoT was designed with going back to previous maps once you have new knowledge and new movement tools.
---
If you will have finished story, continue through story towards Season 3, then PoF, Season 4. Story takes huge amount of time when added all together. 
---
Then, when event hits, you can expect maps being more full, people will focus to be on prioritized maps....and HoT is definitely more fun to play with many people around, as maps are designed to be played by many cooperating people. Enjoy that MMO experience then, because it is non repeatable in any other game. Most other MMOs focus on non-MMO things like 5man dungeons, not on 150 man open world skirmishes you will encounter on HoT maps.
---
If you keep doing mostly HoT through whole event, don't feel bad. Top tier HoT masteries do need brutal amounts of experience, let's say like 5 million per mastery are top ones. And don't expect to get through everything, grinding endlessly would destroy the purpose of boost to let you get through it with less grind :D
---
casuals do not play dungeons and fractals in the first place, anet should only progres on story and put out openworld maps with bosses like tequatl pre rework if they really go the route to cater to casuals.
---
You mean Black Lion Chests?
---
What method of census did you use to come to these conclusions?
---
This may be a bit late but the Legendary Ley Line Anomaly counts as a champion for this event.
---
New raid compilation at some point?
---
It actually did, back when raids were released. Anet seemed to want to go full throttle into raid content. So Guilds gathered their best 10 and didn't survive the pre event of VG.
---
Than the fronts collide. Some just want to throw their heads towards the "boss" until something gives, others want to follow the already established group comp, which would exclude mavericks like bear bow Rangers, the later ones just used their heads and try to figure how to get past the boss and called out mistakes. 
---
In the end the alot of people left their guilds to find like minded people. Our guild caught a lot of those people back in the day. We went from a little group to eight Raid groups at one time, plus people that couldn't promise to be there in time, which filled the spots when someone was missing. The mavericks failed, stopped doing Raids and are now known as the people who tell you that raiding is not for casuals.
---
&gt; 7 Raid Wings (single difficulty + 10 bosses w/ CMs ?)
---
w4 has 4 cms, w5 has 2, w6 has 3, w7 has 3. 
---
12 CMs
---
That's the idea! Follow up your ill-received lootbox with a bundle, so we end up begging for the lootbox instead (instead of, y'know, begging for them to stop yanking us around and farcically pretending that a digital shop selling fictitious goods has scarcity or any need to sell you random items).
---
&gt;who think game companies are going to include everything in the base game
---
It has never been the point. The point is gambling vs purchasing. People don't ask companies to include everything for free (especially in a free-to-play), they want to have the opportunity to purchase what they want without it being locked being randomness.
---
Did you ever ask Mike why?
---
I did check recently. You sure it's woodenpotatos? Can you link the videos?
---
its gross seeing my guildmates throwing money at these "Wardrobe unlocks".   
---
The responses I've seen are exactly what I see / hear at casinos "Man I got this skin that worth 400g (won my bet of 200 on black)" I cant believe this is still legal. They legit prey on the dopamine that is released when you "win" something atleast in real gambling theres monetary value, and you can use your 'winnings' on other bets (house always wins)
---
Thank you for the correction!
---
I thought like that .... then I started playing guardian. ALL the builds.
---
UI and control options from the 21st century.
---
That's what I'd do. The meta events are quite varied and some have multiple paths so have a good amount of replayability. 
---
HoT zones are pretty intimidating at first, so if you get there are your reaction is "I can't even get from A to B without dying", don't worry, we've all been there. When you get some waypoints unlocked and a few of the masteries that open up some shortcuts, they're fine. 
---
Apart from Tangled Depths, where nothing goes where you think it does and to get from A to B you frequently have to go past Z (until you get the waypoints).
---
I always use them in raids (on both condi and power). I just buy a few stacks of each for ~30s after most people have cleared new CMs and are selling the consumables from the reward chests.
---
It's true that Writs are not that much better on average and sometimes might even be worse. With a good static it's usually worth it though even on normal runs.
---
Most people want 50gold per hour replayability, though. Nothing less will satisfy them.
---
its actually this lol which is hilarious.
---
&gt;  World scales to your level? Guess who did it first? GW2
---
Oh dear Jesus. Level scaling has been a thing for over 20 years, just off the top of my head FF8 did it in 1999. And it isn't even something to be praised, it's a time consuming mechanic to keep players from cheesing through low level areas, you know, so you can stick around playing the game for longer.
---
Ahh Guess I missed that. Thanks. 👍
---
I usually have 120+ in sandswept Isles... :)
---
And here I am just wishing me and my one friend could play some meaningful content together.
---
I get mmos are all about these large scale team effort content but I don’t like working with people that want me to play one way in a meta build.  That’s not fun, it’s work.
---
new minis! we need new minis!
---
Honestly, 1200 is still too much for simple reskin. I'd definately pick up more mount skins if they were around outfit price.
---
Updated UI with hotkeys to different tabs and it remembers what you were viewing if you reopen the tab or panel. I think the UI is long overdue.
---

The op has been a redditor for 25 min, and this is yet another veiled troll post to stir up drama in this sort of war between casuals and elitists that's been going on this subreddit for a few weeks already.

Do you have to graduate from Video Game Design college to recognize there is a problem here?

You don’t need meta builds to beat raids. You don’t need meta comps to beat raids. But you need at least something that makes sense. And a bit of time.

Doing a weekly key toon has helped keep my butter stocks up, as well as doing low level map completions for 80% chance of disappointment / 20% chance for BL key
---
are those the people that kick me from groups cause I wont change toons but refuse to do the same on their own account? Love those people.
---
A better horizontal character progression system.
---
Cause I already did it so fuck off.
---
Yes, it's a trash event that sucked my soul dry within 30 minutes. Waypointing frantically around the map for champs that die so fast you can barely target them is zero fun. Especially when combat log says you hit them numerous times and you get no Champion Mark. Max effort, zero return, I'm done.
---
Challenging Group Content.
---
That would be the end of the game for me, that’s for sure.
---
Raids destroyed a guild I was in, it was a raiding guild tho and everyone quit because it got boring and easier difficulty is no fun. It prolly not what OP meant tho, but technically  he's correct.
---
Thanks for the list
---
Still waiting for wvw bags to drop significant loot.
---
You mean the five or six sets of weapons and the three or four sets are armor from Season 4 don't count. These boxes aren't giving you anything new. They're giving you ways to get stuff that's already in the game.  I mean they just added a new weapon set for WvW and PvP.  Why are we conveniently leaving out the stuff that's put in the game.
---
The legit complaints, in my mind, would be mount skins, glider skins and outfits.  That's it.
---
Not for that 5% damage though, but because it offers the most amount of offensive stats that you want after being crit capped.
---
Uhm... you can play the story missions together, hunt for the achievements tied to them, if you're rly good you can do the dungeons with only the both of you. You can grind for legendaries together, you can duo queue in sPvP, you can duo roam in WvW...
---
what is "meaningfull" for you?
---
He was always a pretty negative guy though. It's some months/years since I've seen him in a vid but I personally think you described him perfectly. Not saying he is a bad guy, but he has a style of communication that triggers me very much.
---
If a guild is formed for one purpose and that content is not to the guilds content then there is no point in staying in that guild. Your guild wouldn't have existed in the the first place without raids.
---
Got moth wings, so it looks like I'm on good terms with RNGods ٩(◕‿◕｡)۶ [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Moth\_Wings\_Glider\_Combo](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Moth_Wings_Glider_Combo)
---
Aside from personal luck, I think that loot boxes are cancer. KTGHB should be kind of reward for seasonal events - now it's just a way to dodge loot boxes laws.
---
I loved having to travel around tyria, puzzles, etc.  I just did not like the time gated content being linked to evening reset.
---
I make/get multiple armor sets for different builds. I don't have legendary armor and I hate messing around moving gear around to different characters, so every character has 2-3 sets of stuff, usually. Any time I'm thinking of trying some new build requiring a stat set that character hasn't used before, I know I will also get to fashion wars. I get to use a bigger range of my skins this way... however, you'll find that event with 2+ sets of stuff to fashionize, you'll still have certain skins that are your favourites and you constantly gravitate too. I too have many MANY skins I never get to use.
---
Xpac in 2 years xD
---
&gt; Oh you like this armour set but don't want all of it? Sure no problem, here you can buy individual pieces instead. Can't do that in gw2.
---
Well, when a single armour set is $ 40-80 like it is in PoE you can turn them into individual pieces as each part still sells for between $ 10 - 50. Also they are real-money only. As long as gold to gem conv. is in GW2, Anet won't go for sub 500gems prices as they know people will simply buy whatever piece they want for 40-50 gold instead of buying gems

It's all in his GW1 playlists mate.

champs nolonger spawn in events with alot of people, they removed it, we noticed it, when we just started, from one to the next time 0 champs spawned in both maps, frostgor and orr trains
---
I have themed sets. 
---
So at a glance i can see what my character us built for (power versus condi soulbeast, or support v dps chrono for example) without even having to log in :)
---
No but you toxic lot do nothing but complain about fucking *everything* just for the sake of it.  It's getting really old.
---
Anet's bundles mostly are there to add fillers to things people might want instead of creating "Buy 5 pay 4" deals. Outfit + Glider sets that come with boosters, makeover kits etc. to push the price high to discount from it even though you do not want them, "prep packs" that has ingame currencies that you can easily get etc. simply bloat the packs and make them less appealing.
---
My thoughts are: nothing in life worth having comes easy.
---
Tyrian Tree Huggers Unite!
---
It's not that people didn't like it, it's that people wanted to know if it would ever make it to PC, when hey said no, the fans boo'd. Then the famous line.
---
Is that a Goon on a paraglider?
---
You understand these events are a simulation of real world ambush/defense tactics right? Meaning if you put yourself in the world of the characters and all these mobs/champs start coming at you from different sides towards your encampment, they’re not going to wait for our squad to come mow them down in an orderly fashion in a nice loop. Characters who were already out at those other locations maybe even on the opposite side of the map as your group/squad (whether they were gathering, completing a different event, farming, etc) would have a call to action to defeat these mobs/champs to protect the area/encampment where they are.
---
They probably thought people would just do the champ trains of old. Fish-something I don't remember-norn-wurm-drake-maybe quaggan-troll and not upscaling events which has always been a little contentious since stalling/failing is encouraged by this method.
---
Each class has st least 1 spec that has a place in each game mode.
---
Not all are serious meta picks, but that's just what a meta is, it cherry picks the Best in Slot and discards the rest.
---
If it's like that, what about mesmers?
---
Wait, so it this from using the new BL item or randomly spawn? (This sort of might be a new Current Event.)
---
Already envisioning a big hulking make norn wearing some skimpy “armor” and role playing it as a drag queen to the max 😂
---
Fishing
---
Would rather have Vulkan, but overall yeah I agree.
---
but this one upscaling event made this farm fun, without it you get alot less tokens and compared to meta rush, you got alot more there
---
This sub has been taken over by the toxic alliance.
---
Instanced versions of open world maps and heroes.
---
&gt;players passionate about speed clearing (by the time) hard dungeons.
---
Arguably, hard dungeons is when the difficulty is in getting the bosses down, when it's relevant to
---
even list down which bosses you managed to clear when looking for groups. 
---
Speed clearing being the challenge was already a symptom of the easy nature of dungeons.
---
It's not fun, it's called being useful to the group.
---
I completely agree.
---
But what you described is true of every MMO I've ever played.  That's why it is often called "5 person content".
---
Yet in GW2 there are lots of things open to 2-3 players outside of traditional questing, such as: world bosses, meta events, dynamic local map events, and special events (festivals et al)
---
Coordinating with other people is kind of the basis for a Massively Multiplayer game, so not sure why anyone would be surprised with this.
---
sure, I get that, but still, if commander in lfg asks for a specific kp and you don't provide exactly what he asks for, he has every right to kick you, no matter how weird it may look. If he kicked you for such reason tho, you wouldnt want to be in such a squad anyway
---
Like the first Gen2 stuff where people complained about needing to do stupid sidequests and collections instead of just dumping gold on them like the gen 1 (and then the followup of gen2)?  
---
For my part if LOVED them.
---
Especially Chucka was extremly awesome.
---
i wouldn't call blatantly transparent troll accounts shitposting here a war
---
infestation would be more apropriate
---
i just made pugs pay for consets if i was the one using them lol
---
It was still challenging and is a lot of fun to optimize dungeon runs tbh
---
Since a working engine for big wvw fights was already mentioned I'm gonna go more selfish and say RITUALIST.
---
No.  
---
Casuals with casusal demands and their casual crying destroyed all that...
---
No matter how sarcastic the bingo is, it isn't a real bingo without tengu or cantha.
---
&gt; For those we can yet save. 
---
G'dammit, I didn't need feels today. T-T
---
So because some people dont agree with you by having a different opinion from yours then it’s salt? 
---
You better stop posting on reddit then if you cant take a small exchange of arguments.
---
This is not a Adult Only, ESRB Rated, MMO. Multiple corporations like ESRB, mostly self regulating, have failed everyone here and elsewhere.
---
Having money problems is different for every person, it is a placebo for other issues, it is impossible to protect everyone from what causes their own self destructive behavior. Yet Corporations taking advantage of what is considered a Whale for profit is disgusting. I say this to maybe better clarify on what you're saying, 'cause it's still very much the truth of our reality right now. I don't think you're an ass for thinking of what is a fact.
---
All of these different Gambling Item's and Predatory MTX's touch on so many issues, it is insane to me. One example of a major red flag is how easily available these are to children, normalizing the psychology of gambling, that alone is extremely dangerous.
---
The list of problems continue beyond that and has different afflictions of severe damage, the list of one-sided benefits for this business practice is very few and eventually it will become a unstable economy. Oh . . . and many angry people, some throwing in random issues to undermine the main argument.
---
I have no idea how this will be resolved or other! What is and has been happening in recent years is completely the fault of those that condone it.
---
I think Anet does an increasingly good job in building the enemies like little riddles. They got several different moves / attack patterns with clear strength and wesknesses, which is very similar to how dark souls creates their difficulty with very dumb AI.
---
Now Anet just need to build up on this. One guy had the right "one and only whish" for GW2. Different difficulties for all the content. If Anet would add story mode, challange mode, nightmare mode, ect. to all their existing content A LOT of it would become a lot more interesting for replay.
---
You will be disappointed.
---
With so much hype, most will be like you and disappointment and back to complaining if not right away, relatively soon after  the "new" feel wears off.
---
The ones who won't be disappointed really are the ones who already love the game and are already playing it so much they don't have time for reddit, the majority.
---
Problem with that is that it becomes super niche. Its great to add something to the game, but if almost nobody actually uses it, did you really add anything?
---
Also, its wasted in most situations. In one raid, youll likely see three or four different foods used. Are you going to drop 4 feasts? What about fractals, will you drop 3-4 feasts for 5 people? Very wasteful and unnecessary gold used.
---
Of course, this is all speculation. I imagine the grind along to 500 will be single person foods, and the 500 "reward" are the useless feasts.
---
But what about warclaw kitty skin with retarded face?
---
Yes. Raiding scene is destroyed by casuals and ArenaNet. That's why we have to move on.
---
Asking them nicely  *also* doesn't give you autonomy over all champs. Or force anybody to agree with what you want.
---
So FXIV vanilla story beats the GW2 vanilla story? GW2 has a vanilla story skip, it's called not doing the story. It's literally utterly optional. 
---
FFXIV vanilla story could debatebly be better on paper, when just describing it beat by beat. I'd argue that the way the game as a whole is structured makes it objectively worse: The story is massive and superfluous, you literally can't skip it, everything you'd ever want to do gameplay wise is gated behind completing the story, slow ass emotes and overly verbose dialouge, etc.
---
Skillups recent playthrough took 200 hours (I think minimum) to get to the newest expansion. And that was extremely focused play (typical streamer stuff, etc), with tips/directions and in-game help from his viewerbase.
---
A player can buy PoF today and start it right away. The story to get through it is max 10 hours without distractions.
---
That Norn looks very Russian:-P
---
Don't support very cheap wardrobe unlocks that you can get by just playing the game and getting gold (convert gold to gems)?
---
Quite the opposite, for me.
---
This post gave sufficient info, very clearly, you just can't read.
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
---
Mystical random nerf without a patch and only a few minutes after you confirmed that everything was fine (no nerf)?
---
Sounds pretty unlikely. 
---
Upscaling events to spawn champs always was a wonky thing. Sometimes you get 4-5 champs from one event and sometime you get only one or even zero at the same event with the same amount of people. That's normal. For years...
---
Probably...
---
Completely agree, this would be a fantastic solution.
---
A reputation system. A race change is highly highly like 0.1% likely to happen because story is so heavily connected to your race.
---
You get an extra 10s per champ, so it's strictly better than traditional champ farm. Just do a normal champ farm and get a little extra. Or don't do champ farm and go back to RIBA or Dragonfall.
---
What would make it better in your opinion?
---
Sorry, I was being sarcastic. I agree with your point. I thought the person who you replied to was being intentionally dull so I made a silly post :\\
---
I'm thinking a Legendary All You Can Eat Buffet.
---
The Buffet itself is a reusable item like a permanent BL merchant contract. You double click it to open a dialogue where you drop 1-5 food items. Once you have them slotted in, you click okay to place the interact-able buffet object at your feet.
---
For one hour, or until you change maps, players can interact with the buffet and chose any of the food items available. Those food effects last as long as the player is on the map where the food was eaten, and an hour after they leave.
---
For the player with the buffet they can get a constant effect from any of the food items slotted in the buffet, as long as it's deployed, plus an hour after it's not. 
---
Food items in the buffet expire after 24 hours of the buffet being deployed, or when they're swapped out to load the buffet with a different food in that slot.
---
Before anyone reads this and runs off and subs to FFXIV, which is fine, nothing wrong with that, keep in mind this as compared to GW2:
---
1. Terrible inventory system
---
2. Worse trading system
---
3. Shitty jumping
---
4. Absolutely boring open di
---
5. Old hardmode content is dead in the water.
---
5. And worst of all, no skipping to the final expac. Estimated 200 hours or so of directed, focused, play with no sniffing the flowers. Story presentation starts off worse GW2, improves somewhat, but not as much as GW2 did, leaving it currently even relatively worse.
---
is called open world. If the mob is there and they want to kill it then deal with it.
---
Because they're done mostly wrong, just like mounts. GW1 reputation wasn't that bad, for example.
---
&gt; "Belgium" isn't some absolute arbiter of reality.
---
Nobody, myself included, ever claimed they were. Your statement is worthless and/or intentionally misleading.
---
&gt; just because ANet chooses to not offer something in Belgium, that doesn't necessarily mean that it definitely would be illegal there
---
You're either just not paying attention or you're intentionally trolling.
---
&gt; it's worth it to companies like ANet to brainstorm new concepts that might slip though.
---
They're not trying to slip anything through. If they were, they would have the Bonds available to people in Belgium. That fact that they don't have them available to people in Belgium shows that Arenanet is following the law.
---
&gt; Unless they wanted to do the right thing
---
And here's the actual problem. You've declared that your opinion is "the right thing". Everyone who disagrees with you is therefore "wrong" and probably "evil".
---
I'll repeat myself: *Grow up and take some personal responsibility.* If you can't handle gambling, stay away from opportunities to gamble. The fact you can't handle gambling doesn't mean everyone else should be denied the opportunity to do something they consider to be fun. That's a ridiculous as suggesting that peanuts should be universally banned because they're a deadly allergen to some people.
---
That is completely false, I'm glad you wish me will but this narrative about 100% negativity is pure insanity. The stream has been overwhelmingly positive for a month or more at this point - I barely talk about the game any more lol. Please don't spread this lie.
---
BUILD TEMPLATES.
---
Two and one part time programmer ;p
---
I don't think the people voicing their anger towards lootboxs have gambling additions - Quite the opposite actually. I think they are sick of this shit being put into their hobby because other people have gambling addictions and the devs are looking to exploit them.
---
They're not exploiting me because I just don't buy them, They're relying entirely on people who do have a problem.
---
Whales will whale anyway, lootboxs are not, the only difference is with a lootbox. People who can't control their gambling will keep going.
---
It's not so much about "Expecting the world to change" for anyone and more about getting shitty mini casinos out of my hobby.
---
Yeah you can not make a damned cake with just this.
---
I would have preferred if the collections were to get a version of the base skins with 2 dye channels instead to unlock the mount. Same for the other mount collections that unlock snacks.
---
But there's nothing with the collection itself. 250 of each map currency isn't that much, as it can be done in a few map completions and some of PvP/WvW.
---
1. Click ranked pvp
---
2. Get raged at in chat
---
3. ????
---
4. Play unranked instead
---
My interpretation is the latter. Though given you can make gen1 legendaries through pure PvP/WvW too I don't expect we will the ability to upgrade ascended PvP/WvW weapons to legendary either.
---
No issues on my end.  Been farming trees on all my alts in that time
---
You don't have to wait for it, but you can get ahead getting mastery points beforehand.
---
To say hardcore community is leaving, simply because of some small groups and cliques leaving, makes you look idiotic, and makes your entire point irrelevant.
---
Raids did not divide the community. It was already divided from day one, because it may shock you, but from a pool of players, not everyone shares the same interest.
---
Raids didn't destroy any guilds, slow content release and differing opinions (and drama - as always) between people did. Raids had nothing to do with it.
---
What hardcore players, and players in general have been unhappy with is the rate of content release.
---
Casuals leave on a constant basis...raids have nothing to do with it - that's why they're called casuals. It is in fact the die hard hardcore players that keep the game immensely alive.
---
They have already been releasing fractals on a consistent basis. What are you on about? Going back to my initial comment, you sound like an idiot.
---
New fractal, new map metas, mount skins, new loot boxes
---
Colin Johanson becomes a playable character
---
But only things anet says have any bearing on their plans for the game.
---
&gt;I think wardrobe unlockers are one of the most compelling rewards for long-term players. 
---
You've hit the nail on the head. I have all the Ascended, Legendary, and other stuff I want, so I need something to spend my in-game money on. Wardrobe unlocking has been a goal of mine for a couple of years. The Hunting Bonds are much more compelling in that they are a much better value for my gems than keys.
---
The funny thing is that I rarely make use of an unlock, as I tend to like the in-game armor and weapons better (with the exception of the Storm Bow). So unlocking a new skin is more something to do than wanting something in particular.
---
They're probably a horrible value for newer players, but anyone who plays the game long-term would find them useful.
---
Good for you.
---
I think this picture is probably the best explanation: [swiss system graphic](https://liquipedia.net/commons/images/e/e7/Swiss_System_Graphic.png)
---
(it's from a counter strike tournament, but should be the same)
---
Basically the teams get split into groups based on their score and you only play teams in your score and not the same team twice.
---
So after one round half the teams have won a round (1-0) while the other half has lost a round (0-1) so a winning teams plays against another winner team in the next round, while a loser team plays against a loser team.
---
Next round you have some 2-0 teams, some 0-2 teams and several 1-1 teams.
---
In the case of the picture I linked you either advance one you have won 3 matches or you get kicked out once you lost 3.
---
even better, imagine if it was a [legendary helmet skin option](https://i.warosu.org/data/ck/img/0115/87/1544347266786.jpg)
---
&gt; I got a dye I've had sense the first year of the game.
---
How?  The preview window shows what you might get, those items are locked items.  Not on your account.
---
why did i have to roll 28/30 adoption licences to get the frosty springer skin? 11200 gems btw.
---
oh and anet if you're reading this, dont rub your hands - i have a lot of gold
---
ANet...the other players are killing the champs before I get to them. They are not cooperating with me. This is all your fault ANet!!!!
---
If you were playing at the time of the episodes and you bought a home instance node and you do your home instance most days, there wasn't much farming needed. I only needed the new zone currency, for example.
---
I consider it a gift to my future self to get the currency nodes and farm my instance most days. You never know when you might need the currency.
---
Excited for it!
---
So what happens do people who were human and change to sylvari get their story put back to level 10, does their story stay at 80 but somehow they have found their sister or discovered who killed their parents when that makes no sense. Do they still follow the same god they chose back at character creation so a Sylvari Guardian is somehow following Dwayna. Comparing it to WoW is idiotic I'm afraid at WoWs character creation you choose your race, faction and class. At GW2s character creation you choose your race, class and a biography that sets up the first bulk of your story Anet have done the right thing saying no to this it'll just get too complicated.
---
100% chance to get a skin you didn't have and, if you carefuly get dyes out of the way, 100% chance it's something that otherwise costs more gems.
---
Also, 0% money return that you can play again.
---
Definitely not gambling.
---
I personally like those. I'll prob try to use them to slowly unlock all the BL stuff I'm missing, in a better way than the guaranteed unlock that add quite a layer of rng (to get them from blc). Which means that in the future, on top of reaching my goals to unlock everything but for a kinda more reasonable price (yes it's still whaling, I know), those items will let me acquire gemstore stuff for 160gems each, so basically paying new mount packs for half their price for example, maybe with a delay.
---
Because those who don't like where this game is going aren't playing anymore. Sure, for some people it doesn't matter. Even better! "You don't like it? Then leave!" Well, don't worry about this subreddit. It will become very positive once again, when the rest of still carrying about the future of this game will leave for good. Nasty whiners, am I right? This game is for happy faces! Don't like something? Then shut up or leave, this game is a great place, that's your fault they can't enjoy it anymore! Right?   
---
You are fucking delusional.
---
1: Step into a PvP match
---
2: Get yelled at for being literally worse than Hitler because you are dragging the team down and should instead go learn rotations on the dummies.
---
3: Profit?
---
I found GW1 rep just as bad. It's not different from other MMOs, same old boring fetchquest farming.
---
Hahaha.  I almost responded to your first message saying something along the lines of "Only if I've been drinking!"
---
Season 4 had a few of the painted cutscenes, right? Aurene's visions are always this way, for one.
---
Imagine being this mad lol.
---
People have been saying guild wars 2 is dying since it came out, but it’s still here. I’d bet you money it’ll still be around for at least a few more years if not longer.
---
People said the same shit about runescape back in the 2000’s well into the early 2010’s and guess what, it’s still around and people are still playing and paying.
---
You guys can bitch and moan all you want while not playing the game, those of us who enjoy the game will carry on playing without you.
---
I like them too, for same reasons. Might still buy keys, I like opening those and sometimes want an exclusive but I'll definitely move my spending toward those new bonds. Already bought a bunch for now. I hope they remain available in the future so I can slowly buy a pack/month or something until they're empty (at which point they'll be a way to acquire newer stuff for 160 gems when it gets added in the table).
---
A lot of people don't like the Orr part of the personal story, one reason being that it switches focus away from your character. I personally enjoyed it my first time.
---
"predatory"
---
No one is holding a gun to your head forcing you to buy anything in your free to play game.
---
List fails without "Halflife 3 confirmed"
---
(nice list though. got a good laugh out of me)
---
&gt; does their story stay at 80 but somehow they have found their sister or discovered who killed their parents when that makes no sense.
---
You think WoW faction changes make sense?
---
Your changing race, I don't think you're too worried about your characters story making sense, otherwise you wouldn't be changing race in the first place.
---
&gt;Do they still follow the same god they chose back at character creation so a Sylvari Guardian is somehow following Dwayna. 
---
Obviously not, that shit would get changed to, Maybe you can even re-select it again.
---
&gt;Comparing it to WoW is idiotic I'm afraid at WoWs character creation you choose your race, faction and class. At GW2s character creation you choose your race, class and a biography that sets up the first bulk of your story
---
Lol. WoW factions have a far higher impact on your story than any bullshit you pick at the start of GW2. In WoW your factions determine your entire story, up to the current date, your allies and even the maps and hubs you can go to. In GW2 it's nothing but the very start of the story.
---
Pure ignorance to imply that the choices gw2 have affect the story more than WoW factions.
---
It's not complicated at all, Just have a total makeover kit which has races. Allow people to pick choices again and reset the story if you really must, though I doubt most people using it would care.
---
They could also just restrict it to characters above level 40 and it becomes a non-issue.
---
You forgot about Cantha, replayable LWS1, out-of-game access to crafting and TP...
---
or are your blocks things we *CAN* expect to get at some point? :-P

Confirm or deny: GW2 Tower Defense league?
---
doesn't include artwork or bad memes, so it doesn't fit here. also you could read a tad of criticism towards anet into the title, so it must be downvoted. ^(/s)
---
How do you come by such dumb ideas?
---
I keep them in my pocket.
---
The raid scene in GW2 is already extremely fractured.  Multiple difficulties might actually get more people interested in raiding.  You don't need to go in as deep as WoW did with LFR, but some variety would be very good for the game.  After all even WotLK and such had multiple difficulties, and that 100% helped grow the raiding scene.
---
I think raids are actually about to get a lot of love. A dev told me that because he really loves raiding, he's especially excited to unveil the news on the 30th. No details, but it sounds like something good is coming.
---
I never want to meet who this man is so deathly afraid of waking by talking.
---
Which makes it harder to qualify as you have less time.
---
Would they be able to keep the QP for 2-3 months, maybe that registering cost the 50 QP it normally takes.
---
Literally where in
---
"Wait.. you got someone to read out loud the post? How lazy are you lol"
---
Does it sound like I'm defending Anet in the slightest... no no.. seriously.. point it out.. I'll wait.
---
Fractal leaderboards
---
This is the correct reply.
---
Sadly this is what Anet and Mike O'Brian has told us they more or less have to do. 2000 gems for packs of 5 or special skins. 400 for a random one (because they can't afford to do it otherwise if it's not random --still doesn't make sense to me) or 1200 gems for pick which one you want from those random skins. I guess this is saying that 1200 gems is the price that they have to sell them for. I do think it's reasonable for them to add 1200 gems for 1 warclaw from the pack of 5, IF you really want to pay that much. (personally I think 1200 for a reskin is silly)
---
Power chrono is still ok, though on open world its a bit more clunky without 0 clone shatters. Support chrono is still very much desired I guess. Its a bit clunkier than FB in its boon share as you rely on allies being inside the wells for the last tick. For both builds its also annoying that Continuum Split was moved to f4, especially if you are used to it.
---
I would say the community is bit salty on playing chrono, with good reason. The gameplay is much more duller than it was before and the support you give is not so much reliable anymore compared to other builds. Still, chrono is one of the best tanks, it can offer good utility like CC, pulls and portals and its the only spec that can maintain perma Quickness and Alacrity, so for better or for worse it is going to stay.

It is a gambling mechanic. In a game rated for minors.

I honestly feel like if they remastered GW2 and advertised it they would get so many more players
---
EU, pugging was great up until around w6 release, it started to go downhill from there, with people quitting the game
---
Swimsuits.
---
I'll take any of: 
---
•Graphical upgrade / multi-threading
---
•Major itemization overhaul. Improve crafting, item acquisition, item sinks to retain value, attributes and how they're applied, and rune/sigil/glyph UI.
---
•Combat design/Enemy AI overhaul. Smarter, nastier enemies where they are needed; trim the cheap shit off others that are overtuned; build in Stamina to enemies, build Defiance to be selective in what it blocks; basically make it so enemies have counter-play strategies and a reason to use them.
---
How much trouble do people really have with XP? You literally pop cheapo food and a pot, maybe a booster if you have a celebration or birthday, then run something like 4 dragon stands and you have maxed out HoT; run dragon fall and you maxed PoF.
---
Try posting the complete crash details from the popup message here. It's very long but it includes a lot of helpful data to diagnose your problem.
---
I'm interested in how it could look and looking forward for the results, but I'm not a huge fan of turning an artstyle to photorealistic graphics. GW2 looks good the way it is now because Anet chose not to do photorealism. On the other hand, with a modern engine it could still be more detailed and keep the same artstyle.
---
Nevertheless, it's a nice project for practice and it's probably easier to do photorealism as the assets are easier to come by.
---
Good luck to you!

This guide is outstanding.  
---
People talk about Saltiness in PVP 90% of the time, but if you are able to look past that, its the most complete and most rewarding game mode by far. Follow this guide, dont be a butthurt kiddo and you have the greatest time in PVP.   
---
Thanks so much for this Doc, I find this excellent!
---
Do those drop at all naturally in the game? I feel like part of the backlash against Eternals is there is no in-game way (no matter how rare) to obtain them. Let this not be an excuse to TF2s particular brand of monetization though.
---
I know they redesigned Rata Sum, so not surprised they did parts of LA too.
---
Bundle is better than the warclaw one though.
---
Build Templates
---
I do agree with you 100%..
---
But in theory you can play the game.. get 75g and tranfer them to 200gems.. buy one contract and recieve a reward.. I know it is not the same by far.. but it's still a way to do things.
---
P.S. Still I hope for another set of achievs like it was with Mistward set. It was awesome. It was worth it. I need more!
---
We also didn't think that our amazing game wouldn't get replaced with a botched sequel either, but that ended up happening
---
Well designed dungeons.
---
its not so much about if it is good of bad and more of, who the hell it was and who the hell are all this people hehe
---
I was with you until this
---
&gt;It's important, that rewards will scale. Meaning highest difficulty drops more currency, lower difficulties drop less currency, but all difficulties drop the same currency, meaning everything will be achieveable for everyone.
---
Since it will almost certainly have a cap, having additional difficultys is pointless if anyone can just get it from facerolling for a couple of hours.
---
Currencys should differ. 
---
&gt;It's just going to take longer and be more of a grueling grind if you suck at the game, versus being good at the game.
---
But it's not because weekly caps are going to always be a thing.
---
I'm not defending shit, so dont speak for everyone. Getting Skyscale and doing the collection is easy af, if it's too hard for you then sorry I cant relate.
---
1) ok let's use your definition. So now gambling is everything that has an input, and a rng output. So now you can't use this word in any argument against anything (no matter if minors are involved). Good, you'll have to find better arguments.
---
2) you reply too quick, I'm 100% sure you didn't read&amp;understand before replying. As far as I'm concerned, it means I win, no matter how wrong I may actually be in a given argument.
---
3) I see you're irrational and childish but I can do it too. My opinion is the best opinion, it's a great opinion, and it can't be wrong (especially being an opinion). You're the one who's opinion is biased and wrong. Never seen an opinion as wrong as yours (and I know that for certain, given that your opinions are the only ones in the world that can be wrong, since everyone else agrees that opinions are not facts)
---
Yes but only to the wrong people.
---
I use my chronomancer to harvest flax in verdant brink at 6 am when no one is on so that people forget I have a fully geared chrono and I don't get asked to use it. That's how I play my chronomancer.
---
Bold of you to assume we get more than 4 announcements.
---
Sorry I thought you meant story mode as solo content. I apologize for my misunderstanding.  
---
As for open world, it’s no different than any other MMO then. But GW2 has fairly unique combat system, both in ability execution and enemy mob interaction. The breaker bar system I outlined above could be used open world and have positive effects for reaching the player base about their CC abilities and their impacts. But that is just one idea I’ve had. I’m sure others have/had just as many I’m sure better ideas than that. Especially the developers who have way more experience. 
---
But if we’re talking about roles, that implies group (or AI group) content. If you’re solo in the purest form your ‘role’ doesn’t matter as long as you’ve constructed yourself in such manner to overcome your obstacle in a speed/style you enjoy.
---
As a PvP player, thank you!
---
Lol bottom row can only happen if they announce that there will be one more raid then raids will be forever scrapped
---
Dude just play the game it's not hard, with all the lack of content gw2 has, you have plenty of time to play gw2 and have a better experience than listening to WP.
---
Personally, I'd rather have the XP boost while doing the masteries in HoT than in any living season.
---
Thanks for your fast reaction guys, i already changed link to behance which is safe for sure, and gonna check what is happening on my own site.
---
Once again sorry for problems!
---
This is a surefire way to pretty much ruin a game for everyone xD
---
&gt; I think this picture is probably the best explanation: swiss system graphic
---
[Your link is busted.](http://prntscr.com/ovpt59)
---
I think that was just in-game footage to announce the project.
---
If this is PvE, just keep playing the class and you’ll get better.
---
Watching rotation videos also helps to get how things work, etc.
---
I always heard that UE 4 doesnt have the best performance for multiplayer, but there is fortnite with 100 man. I wonder if gw2 will be better or worse on world boss slide shows on that engine
---
Bro dont hype yourself all that will do is leave you crying. My only expectation from the Aug 30 announcement is GW3: Immortal, "dont you guys have phones". Keep your expectations low so you dont get burnt.
---
If you only wanted a specific skin, why not just buy the selection license instead?
---
Yea looks okay to me, maybe the 'le gasp' bit is a bit cringe.
---
I have upvoted it, seems sound
---
It is aimed at active completionists. I am definetly no whale (last time I spend money was for pof deluxe edition) and everything I can get out of those bonds are things that are much more expensive than 200 gems or it's converted value in gold. But I am also buying black lion skins for gold since the overhaul of black lion chests because they are bloody cheap and the free tickets will regain the loss by itself. So, it is not for everyone but it is a state of the game everyone can achieve as long as they are playing constantely. And that is most likely the problem for so many :D
---
Thats exactly how it was :)
---
Why?
---
&gt; quadruple the use of every release
---
And octuple the work for every release.
---
Hence why I suggested that they also put out individual licenses for the bundle skins? I don't want to go back to a loot box idea at all.
---
The bundles are nice since I can buy all skyscale type skins *only*, and then spread them out over my characters. But it'd be really nice if I could pick and choose, so individual licenses would be nice *alongside* the bundles.
---
They will chose what's more important to them. Having a challenge or having a fun and simple-ish grind. They're both worth the same as a human being and have the same right to the same loot. It's okay to let them be.
---
Elementalist requires you to have a solid understanding of something like 70-80% of your abilities.  Weaver is a lot more glassy than Tempest is, so I'd suggest starting Tempest first and getting used to your "base" abilities (Dagger, Scepter, Staff) and the various off-hands like dagger, focus or warhorn first.  It's important to understand what each combination brings to the table.  
---
For example, off-hand focus is generally the defensive power-weapon and the offensive condition-weapon, but it also has some powerful defensive utility in skills like magnetic reflection (Focus 4 Earth), Obsidian Flesh (Focus 5 Earth) &amp; Swirling winds (Air 4).  For the most part Water attunement provides sustain or condition cleanse and Earth is defensive or condition focused.  
---
The thing about Weaver is that it's glassy meaning that most of your "defense" comes from active skills.  It'll come from things like the sword (2) evade in Water, Earth and if you take the Arcane Specialization - Arcane Shielding proc - as well as a few other skills like cantrips (eg; Lightning Flash), evades (Fiery Whirl - FGS3), and stance skills like Twist of Fate.  Much of your defensive prowess as a Weaver comes from, "Offense is the best defense," and strategically using down-state lavafonts. 
---
You don't have to optimize for PvE Fractals, Raids in open world -- you don't "have" to be full Berserker.  The bar you should set is really just learning your abilities, surviving and slowly moving the goalposts as you get more comfortable and familiar with the class.  Eventually you may find that you don't need things like Twist of Fate (stun-breaks) or Arcane Shield, but they're good options.  
---
The big realization from more "complex" classes is that they have a ton of utility.  For example, Engineer has blinds on almost every toolkit; smoke bomb, smoke grenade, exhaust vent.  Both have tons of combo fields and blast finishers for self-combo support or even might-stacking.  You need to learn how to manage and abuse innate utility when you can't count on having optimal boons.  
---
Often times in Path of Fire you'll need to learn to pay attention to boons.  Lots of the enemies apply protection to themselves or allies which is a significant damage reduction, fire dangerous projectiles or really get up in your face.  You need to learn to anticipate various PvE attack patterns; -- what is their "primary" combat strategy? Do you need to run away/reset, kite for cooldowns? 
---
Fresh Air Elementalist has existed since core.  You can play with pretty much any combination of weapons under the sun.  You don't need to stick to Weaver or Sword/Dagger; you could play Sword-Focus, you could play Scepter/Dagger, Dagger/Dagger.  You could play Dagger/Warhorn Tempest.  Each play slightly differently, and while the damage potential is "less" different options bring different tactics to the table based on which skills they offer.  
---
The big part of "more complex" classes is getting familiar with their skills.  Almost any time I was learning a new class or build in GW2 I was familiarizing myself with their skills in the downtime; the range, cooldown, stun-break?, blast finisher?, blind?, poison.  Don't settle for a lesser understanding; become more intimately familiar with what your Atonement and dual skills do.
---
Patrick star: Is freezie the snowman a raid?
---
Why is that hat staring at me?
---
Not really. Same instance, slightly different mechanics and numbers. What's that going to be, 20% more work? 5%? I wouldn't know, but I'm convinced that not having to do content from scratch but recycle it in different difficulties will be way faster than having to cater to every group with entirely fresh stuff created from scratch.
---
It’s seems like a big feedback loop then. Games aren’t made for Linux because there ‘aren’t many users’, and gamers don’t switch to Linux because there aren’t as many games that natively support it.
---
The only way to get those players to stick around is for anet to redo the core game. Otherwise most of those players will leave after dancing to the cows in Queensdale
---
And no where did I suggest to go back to lootbox, I suggested to go back to the way every other pack with different themed skins worked where we got skins for all the mounts and a choice option to buy from the pack. Yes you could gamble on them but you could buy the one you wanted via choice.
---
Yes adding that to the warclaw/skyscale boxes would be nice but personally I would still rather see full packs with skins or ALL the mounts instead of just one.
---
&gt; Edna Modes
---
best thing about that character is that it was voiced by the Director, he had just been doing it to stand-in until they could get someone better, but **no one** could do the part better than he could.
---
Playing devil's advocat: the title is baity and the video itself is mostly pointless. People would expect to see something substantial and revolutionary, but it isn't, so it's a letdown. OP's comment would've worked better as a self-post, and it would've been less misleading.
---
Have you unlocked the gliding mastery? Also what level are you because some skin-cosmetic items actually require a level to use
---
Thats when I started getting more involved myself tbh, but I get where they are comming from
---
&gt; Change my view.
---
Nobody would have an issue if the items were directly sold for cash without an RNG involved. Your view is retarded.
---
Nobody would have an issue if the items people are after were directly sold for cash without an RNG involved. 
---
Your view is either retarded or deliberately ignores this fact.
---
Thanks for the tips
---
Nope. I kind of love it :-)
---
Contact Support.
---
Judging from the unused boost, package of old equipment in your inventory, and the bandit crest counter in the bottom right, you must be in the middle of a boost trial. Try consuming the skin again once you're finished with the trial.
---
I cant even see what masteries are part of it yet, it's still locked cause im progressing living story 2 i guess
---
Seconded.
---
Is there a faster way to do step 1 without having to block each person individually?
---
But wanting to be rewarded for your hard work is inherent in human nature and effective emotional maturation. Otherwise it sets an unhealthy subconscious link between effort put in and reward received.
---
That's easy to say if you were among the people who got to play it. For some reason, I didn't (don't remember why, I've been here since forever!)
---
Yeah man we're on the same page. And honestly, once you get past the story it's all fun and games. 
---
Honestly it's getting through the story that is by far the biggest hurdle. It's just all so fucked up from a new player perspective. I just always feel like I need to speak up and warn people like some doomsayer when someone offers FFXIV as a game to play. It's a sizeable monetary investment, and ESPECIALLY if you're coming from GW2 or a single player game, you'll have to put in so much work to get to a place where the majority of the player base is, and if you're bum rushing the story, it becomes such a feet dragging monotonous drag. There's literally quests to go get herbs for somebodies tea, in the main story. And yeah that might have been one of the lowest moments but honestly, it's still on the bell curve of the rest of the plot, it's not an outlier.
---
And then you get people saying "Hey man, enjoy the story and take it slow! The game was built to play the story!" Dude if I want a good story I'll read a book, MMORPG stories as a whole are a level under video game stories, which are a level under the rest of all media. It can be a good driving force if used properly, but that's it. As you said about GW2, and it's the same with FFXIV, there's just these massive narrative issues in order to mantain a persistent world and keep the MC as a Mary Sue. Add on top of that the way these games are developed, it's a miracle they make sense at all.
---
Sorry, /rant. I just I don't like the mentality of "just wait it gets good". And on top of all that you get typical MMORPG player mentality who's (as a population) sense of time is utterly warped and fucked up since they (we T_T I'm addicted send help) typically play these massive addicting and time consuming games. 200 hours to get to the "real game" is ridiculous!!! Why is it okay here and not acceptable in any other situation in a game or outside a game??? "Hey man watch this show, the first 20 seasons suck, but I swear seasons 20-70 are great!" I swear I've been convinced the MMORPG and similar lifestyle game players (again, that's me again send help) have some sort of psychological Stockholm Syndrome when it comes to how much shit they're willing to wade through. Whoops /rant again.
---
Again, we're on the same page, clearly I've had some issues with the game lmao.
---
As some minor quibbles/discussion points.
---
1. The moment you start farming materials for crafting, the lack of material bank becomes glaringly important. Also, the UI is just cumbersome.
---
2. I meant the trading post, again it's much more cumbersome/can only be accessed from one spot. It doesn't enable TP barons as well, you can't "play the stock market" as effectively to make megabillions. On the flip side, the entry to play the market is lower imo. Also, crafting is actually profitable, and the economy of items is way more balanced.
---
3. The jumping extends to rest of movement, it just feels sluggish and bleh. I'm a addicted jumper so I definitely feel it.
---
4. Even if level sync was a thing, the expansion dynamic meta maps in GW2 really are a unique gaming experience. HW in FFXIV tried to do that with the whatsamacallit map, and it was dead on arrival. Eureka worked, but now it's dead because of ShB.
---
5. My problem here is it's really impossible to experience older hardmode content as it was released. Like twintania or something. If people want the mounts from the trails they just desync and grind. Versus GW2 keeps stuff inline alot better. Like, even dungeons still got LFGs going.
---
In terms of story, as I ranted earlier the entire lifestyle video game genre is fundementally extremely difficult to get good story into. We probably both could go on and on about both lmao. The big takeaway imo is that GW2 at the very least let's you pick and choose what to do.
---
Tl;Dr this post was never meant to be so long and mostly is just me babbling
---
I doubt you could even imagine...
---
Just in case the reference is missed-&gt; Elden Ring
---
I mean I don't know why would someone be against more dungeons. It would require more work to release stories like that but anything requires work, that shouldn't stop people from suggesting stuff.
---
I have absolutely no clue how long those stories are tbh, LS2 is going quite fast tbh but indeed I dont know if i can fit the rest in before the event. But since it works on HoT as well I guess its worth it there as well
---
Couches? Beds to pretend sleep on? Hey, maybe in-game SPOUSES AND KIDS!!
---
No.F-ing.WAY LOL
---
Thnx, for now, the masteries are still locked to me.
---
Can anyone remake GW1 in a modern engine, pretty please?
---
So going for it! thnx
---
Yeah, the shatter changes are very annoying but the reality of it is you get a few seconds of ramp up at the start. 
---
It's still a decent DPS spec in fractals, it just doesn't have godmode support skills. 
---
Like I said, if you're not desperate to be the most efficient at all times, it's fine.
---
That's why you start with 1-2 defensive utilities like Arcane Shield or Twist of Fate (stun-break) and condition yourself to use them.  They'll provide a little bit of a defensive stop-gap so that you can gradually familiarize yourself with your other elemental attainments.  Don't worry about min/maxing effectiveness in open world unless you're playing with quality boons.  The thing about Raid/Fractal builds -- especially on Elementalist -- is that they're designed for like 7-8 boons; 25 might, fury, quickness, alacrity -- your experience playing in open world isn't going to reflect the endgame oriented builds.  
---
In a vacuum all you're really concerned about is DPS and proper dodging in raids/fractals (plus mechanics if need be).  You'll pretty much almost exclusively be rotating between Fire/Air; I look at open world an an excuse for other abilities to shine and to improve your understanding of the game mechanics as a whole; to use what you have in about every way you can imagine.
---
 The reason for the downvotes is the misleading/clickbait title. Otherwise a lovely little project.
---
Oh that makes so much sence! Thanks
---
I am very new to the game, I have no clue how much trouble people have with XP, however since they offered a double xp couple of weeks i was curious if I should wait with the story or not. I guess not from what I see now
---
I just bought 5 plus the 1 free and I got: 1 really rare dye worh 240 gold, a dye worth 12 gold, a skin (Taimy’s), 2 weapon skins which I could not find at TP, and one more that I can’t remember. 
---
I feel good about the outcome.
---
Not really redesigned afaik, but only made for this trailer. I saw a video of WoodenPotatoes (or maybe thatShahman, been a while so not sure anymore) where he/she had the map from somewhere and it really only was what was shown in the trailer. They just created it probably to have something to show for it. Not that I mind, I like new Rata Sum.
---
I'm newly returning as well. Just downloaded last night not even sure what characters I have at this point but looking to restart anyways. DM your ign and I'll add you when I get home from work
---
It's trying to decide what house you belong to.
---
You assume it would cost allot more then it likely would
---
My assumption is based on current market prices. But if Anet would *actually* price these things percentaged to 30€ in total ... that'd be great of course, yes. But it'd also mean like 1€ or something per specialization, and I just don't see that happening.
---
as long as you bring back the original login screen from game launch, i'll support almost anything
---
Inflation.
---
It could start with single player mode and 5 man modes only, then they could test the waters with CMs. Its better than making 100% disposable content like story instances.
---
because the original adoption licences that have frosty springer don't have selection license?
---
Patreon when?
---
and you could just ignore what i just said
---
OMG this is sooo good Clap
---
Photorealistic is a bad idea. It will have to extend to everything and then you have stuff like "WTF is a photorealistic ooze supposed to look like?"
---
I'd rather have DX11 for compatibility to be honest. Isn't DX12 windows 10 exclusive? I'm not asking for XP support there are still plenty of people with windows 7/8.1 and I feel like DX11 would be a nice compromise and either way its still way better than DX9... Now if Microsoft could do the same thing they did with WoW's DX12, then that'd be awesome.
---
GMs don't read bug reports. topkek
---
I am saying that even if different difficulty tiers in story instances are problematic, there could still be 5 man versions of story instances. Its different.
---
Where's the box for "PvE that doesn't suck"?
---
Middle column + 500Jeweler seems pretty surefire bets.
---
I don't average even *half* so I wouldn't really know...
---
This isn't pocket change.  You have no chance at a trash outcome.  Random, yes, but you are going to literally always win.  Always.  No risk at all.  It's like buying a mystery toy box.  Always a toy in the box every time, but that isn't gambling and is 100% for children and is using money for a random outcome.
---
mesmer is nowhere near the level of versatility and overall dominance guard has, if anything it has been a relentless pounding for mesmers balance wise.
---
Guardian is the best class in the game right now.
---
Top tier power and condi dps along with excellent heal builds.
---
They’ll keep selling skins this way if people keep buying, this is the reason why both my Warclaw and Skycale are still using the default skin.
---
Which makes little sense since upgrade to win 10 is to this day free. Okay if your computer is too old to not run win 10 it's a problem. However even my 10 year old laptop was able to upgrade. So if you have something older than that you might want to think have to get something new anyway.
---
Exactly. Eventually you will get EVERY possible reward from them, in theory. If you dont play long enough to find it worth buying as many as it would take to unlock everything, that doesnt change that eventually every single thing on there is guaranteed to be a drop.
---
GvG to justify the game title.
---
And when they get through the faceroll grind, what will drive them to do those higher difficulties? There's literally no other reward, and it's even easier to faceroll those rewards on lower difficulty, it just takes a little more time.
---
That sounds more like people tried calling it prestigious to help themselves cope with getting through it.
---
I mean we all sort of "know" why your have low stock on carrots and onions, and butter, but if I were the developer who designed the recipes and/or added Celery et al to the game, I'd look at your screenshot and conclude something is off when your storage for consumable ingredients shows next to nothing on some, while others are at max, despite none of them having better drop rates or easier to farm.
---
Yes
---
I want Engineers to have an alchemy trait that allows them to place a basket of elixirs on the ground instead of toss elixirs (as tool belt skills). Then other players, and the engineer, can go to each basket, and use the full elixir on a longer cool down. I would also like for the players to lose a gold every time they use it and give it to me.
---
I bet a majority of GW2 player base never used twitch. So in a way, they are right to say that. Furthermore if Anet never pushed anything for having a huge presence on twitch, maybe it's because they know their typical target isn't using twitch.
---
I agree with the approach but you also have to keep the 50g price tag for each node in mind.
---
LOL that'd be awesome! They should do that for april fools next year.
---
The saddle collection to be at least is a lot less cancerous than the first few parts of the overall series of collections
---
It's truly annoying how many people do not realize that this is not physically possible. You can extract outfits and armor pieces from the .dat and look at them. They are not built the same way, they cannot map onto each other.
---
Tos doesn't allow it. Howeeeeever you can ask for email and pw change at which point it's your account. The details at this point can only be rewerted through giving anet the gamekeys of purchases and ask for a reset. So if you make sure you are the only one with the gamekeys nobody can take your account then.
---
Seems so indeed, here's a pic of the progress bar I took 14h after event start in LA: https://i.imgur.com/HItIJz4.png
---
Mesmers was God like for ages my friend, dominating in every single place inside the game.
---
I'm talking as a guard main tbh.
---
Agree for the versatility, but not for the need of each class in game..
---
Those are fair arguments yeah, though there are popular MMOs that use difficulty tier system in organized PvE with varying success and in gw2 fractal tiers have worked for better or worse. People also seemed to receive the more challenging solo content like Liadri well. There is also a demand for repeatable CM raids and more CM fractals that I see often in here.
---
So without further knowledge in this matter, I am optimistic that story instances with different difficulty tiers may work. It will for sure require more work to make content with difficulty levels that is not watered down like you pointed out, but if its well received then the work would have paid off (hence 'they could try'). 
---
Same goes for 5 man versions. They could start with putting the bare minimum for 5 man (more damage, more health etc) with some currencies and if its received well, then newer story instances could have more elaborate 5 man versions. I believe there is noticeable demand for dungeons and repeatable content to atleast look into OP's idea.
---
And sorry if I was aggressive to the edit, you can't trust people here sometimes.
---
I bet it is because people assume it will progress based on number of champions killed ...
---
Dude I have, I've nearly filled out my hall of monuments.
---
My partner has just gotten in to guild wars 2 and I was wanting to fill her in with the backstory.
---
Woodens videos were perfect till they ended. And there's no way she's gonna play guild wars 1.
---
Those fights are fun for one player. They'd need to be fundamentally different to be fun as replayable 5 man content. Some number tweaking won't solve problems like bad pacing of the fights (and the entire instances around them), bad telegraphing, extremely simplistic mechanics, and the fact that they very often rely on gimmicks (like sohothin or the special action key in the Caudecus fight).
---
There'd basically need to be an entirely redesigned fight, and ANet themselves have said that redesigning stuff takes almost as much time as creating entirely new content.
---
His YouTube woodenpotatos? Yes
---
and thus a great game was born
---
sadly you missing best releases of the game :/
---
Nope.
---
good effort!
---
The progress bar right now where I am looks at least at 1%. If it is bugged I hope Anet fix it soon because this is only happening till next Tuesday. If its not bugged please in any map your in tell people to hand in their marks.
---
By whom lol
---
Miło by było gdybyś miał już coś zrobione i z tym przychodził a nie prosił o follow dla projektu, który może doprowadzisz do końca a może nie. Jak na razie to bardzo nędzne żebranie o subskrybcje - nie wspominając o kiepskim audio... Sorry stary. Powodzenia w każdym razie. 
---
So far, this is nothing but a really low clickbait with begging for following a project that may happen or not.
---
The Kryta maps have the champ bandits, which show up regularly.  There was a really good train in Kessex Hills yesterday.
---
Good Memes
---
Stalled out at exploitation station huh?! Damn shame....damn shame.
---
As good as GW2 is, this needs to happen. Imo the current game has too many maps, inconsistent systems, and the good ole spaghetti code that limits the what the devs can do. It would be awesome to have a game with updated GW2 world/graphics with the GW1 combat system.
---
I actually think MMOs would be better served with a planned expansions from the start (preferably a trilogy). They need to have an end, otherwise it gets too disjointed.
---
It's absurd...but we should embrace this
---
There are also a bunch of food that give you might, you could look into one of those, because I highly doubt losing the +5% sigil is going to be worthwhile.
---
They aren't new to this genre, they should know that if they start giving out extra loot, people are going to farm it in the easiest way possible.
---
Try Dragonfall or RIBA metas. RIBA is boring, but Dragonfall can be fun and gives great rewards. Both can yield \~20g/hour (some estimate as much as 31g/hr), so you could get a contract by watching a couple episodes of The Umbrella Academy on Netflix while doing one of the Metas.
---
One other thought is to pick up a couple of paid accounts (I got two extras when they were on sale @$10), as they passively generate a lot of income every month between MC's and Laurels, amongst other things.
---
And FWIW, I'm no whale (and a real gamer, &gt;30k AP) in GW2, as I rarely spend money, maybe $100 in gems in 7 years. But I converted enough gold to gems prior to the sale to pick up the WvW mount set and a 15 pack of contracts (4,400 gems total). So they're not only for whales.
---
Why not Vulkan?
---
Thanks I exchanged it with their twitter message linking it in case someone still tries to look at it
---
DX 11 is a 10 year old API why would you even want that? It doesn’t have the same CPU benefits that DX12 does.
---
If anything you should hope for a Vulcan update.
---
I think they will use it like Blizzcon. I don't expect any new games being announced maybe something GW1 connected but I think it will be this is whats going on with GW2s living world and maybe an expansion announcement at the end to let people know its coming.
---
I don't think its near impossible to design content with different difficulty levels. Challenging for sure. The tiers for fractals are testament to that and they work well enough. 
---
Also, not all players who want more repeatable content can be considered hardcore. We simply have no way of knowing whether simple changes to story bosses to make 5 man versions won't work unless we try. It may be that 5 man story bosses are liked by enough players to warrant working on it, even if they are not as challenging as the hardcore crowd would like them to be. The old dungeons are still run for better or worse, both by casuals who like them and hardcores who want to solo or speedrun them.
---
This, a screen shot of some past work that might look similar to his vision would have made sense, but instead we got a pointless video with a 30 second intro to get to "I'm going to stream the ACTUAL work on twitch".
---
There will be no expac talk.
---
Its not even that, its the fact that there are only a few champ trains in the game, that Anet knew people would go to, but some of the maps have been nerfed to dirt, the cursed shore is shocking, you can do events now that used to spawn 5-10 champs, and now they spawn 0 and 5-10 Elite mobs instead, 
---
Anet completely destroyed this event, with years and years of nerfs to the maps and events, then put an event in game that needs those events to be farmed, it was lackluster oversight from Anet, they just dangle the carrot and some people keep trying to grab it.
---
I wish we had a good pace of content so suggestions wouldn't be met by 'but it will take away from X'. I can't blame you.
---
Their whole marketing after last year anniversary is pr talk about how living world is second coming of Christ. There will be no more expacs for gw2
---
this is an amazing song
---
The hardcore playerbase has been suggesting this for years. But it keeps getting downvoted.
---
Also, based on past threads on this exact topic, casuals *detest* this idea because (I quote): "the Living Story is meant to be played once and solo."
---
I've also seen comments stating they'd hate it because it would make them feel left out of the content.
---
Why ANET isn't ignoring them and giving the greenlight to double living story into dungeons/raids, I'll never know why.
---
Univewsaw pwofessionaw gamew
---
Some were from Kung Fu Tea, some I bought during a $5 sale way back.  Others are from friends that buy Humble Bundle packs and come with serial keys and don't want them so they give them to me.
---
I would be willing just for repeatable solo story instances too, if nothing else will be implemented. I guess that would be the bare minimum.
---
+1 for Vulkan
---
On Sloth, is it true that if BS takes first shroom, the effects of his banners are applied to Sloth against the team? I've just been told that, after months of believing that BS should preferably take first shroom.
---
Yeah, I understand that level scaling isn't a new technology. My main point is that WoW is slow as hell at adopting better technology and has fallen waaaay behind on what a flagship MMO should be. Some people tout WoW as the #1 MMO, and they think it defined the parameters of what an "ideal MMO" should be. I'm arguing that WoW has lost its edge years ago and in terms of MMO design, has either stagnated or resorted to slowly adopting technology from other, better MMOs.
---
Yeah me too, but it's happened so many times that ANet allocates resources to some new experiment that it's necessary to actually focus on the neglected stuff. 2v2 maps are the most recent grating example. Not a bad idea in theory, but not enough support and it clearly takes away from the main mode. There have been 3 2v2 maps and only 2 5v5 'recently'.
---
I like they are trying to do more with existing content, for example the various 'blitz' events we've seen.  Sure, it's nothing more than 'busywork' for us as there is nothing else to do, but at least it is something.
---
Aug 30th is going to be a pivotal day for a lot of folks - let's cross our fingers and hope ANET delivers.
---
And I do have a phone, but I don't want to use it to play GW2 (or Diablo for that matter)
---
Making sure it wasn't just me.  I usually do 4 accounts at once and use [Sizer](http://www.brianapps.net/sizer4/)  With a hotkey for size and positioning, and put each account in the 4 corners of my screen.  And do their daily stuff and all that.  If I do many accounts back to back is when I get that problem.  So I normally have to do about 12 accounts (in sets of 4).. take a break like watch a movie or w/e to pass the time, then do another 12... and then take a break  ( I can play on my main for that time if I want) and then do the last 11.  At least this way I don't get that error, or not as likely.  I just don't get why it happens.  Thinking there might be a temporary ban on the IP trying to login?
---
Persisting flames is never worth losing in pve IMO because not only that it gives you extra damage on your main skills (as well as some random fury), it's also one of the best rallying tools in game when paired with passive effect of downed skill 5.
---
You can simply use exotic weapon with battle/strength sigil or carry another gear set with strength/pack runes. Fire aura (and arcane traits) also gives some might so having 10 stacks should be pretty easy.
---
... and then they complain about too many things being in the gem store? @_@
---
The recently introduced Legendary Runes/Sigils that give no additional glowing effect say "ahai"
---
Pretty much this.  I've tried a couple of times to do champ trains and every time people were mostly sitting around because the champs have been killed out of order..  I think casuals think it's a champ free-for-all, so people get into the map, camp a champ, kill it, get bored and move on.  Consequently, the train is constantly out of sequence.  Here's hoping that people will figure this out.
---
[The Steam Link app works surprisingly well for this.](https://www.pcmag.com/feature/361609/how-to-stream-pc-games-on-android-and-ios)  I haven't tried with GW2 yet, but it should work.
---
As a PvE Guardian man, you're outta your mind.
---
if you change stats you get a new skin with a different color
---
TBH I'd love a hardmode for the open world.
---
Heck, make it so you actually need like 10+ people just to walk across the map, let alone do the meta
---
Yeah I thought it was related as such to prevent people from ddosing the servers. It's a bummer I can't just launch a crazy amounts of accounts at once though. Although I did make a script that logins at night using launch parameters for gw2launcher and auto logs out. Just have to clean up the dailies box from time to time. I really like gw2launcher because you can launch it, and it auto updates every account each time there's a patch.
---
The best thing that comes from long waiting times and frustration are good fucking memes. Keep'em coming.
---
That's true. You are spending gold for (possible) future time saved.
---
Thank you. İ will definitely try it.
---
Comparing your pic to the one now:
---
https://puu.sh/E7X8P/3015f6c784.png
---
you can see the progress bar is longer (it extends a good deal beyond the colon now)  the bar isn't bugged, it just got longer, so the completion percentage is less.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan_(API)
---
It’s runs at all of those and more. Performance comparable if not better than DX12. Most popular performing Vulkan titles are probably Doom, Doom Eternal, and he two most recent Wolfenstein games. There are a bunch others as well.
---
But can I use a Transmutation Charge to apply the "old" skin with the other colours?
---
Okay thx
---
i know i have a legendary rune. I was only half serious about legendary food effects.
---
Since your question was already answered, I will add that if you have the gold, you can swap stats in the forge to grab every color variant of ascended weapon (well at least the variants you can swap to, I think blue and tequatl have to be obtained from fractals/teq respectively). One weapon, bunch of wardrobe unlocks lol
---
throwing stuff into a forge creates a completely new item. when you change the stats of an ascended piece, all you really do is forge a *new* item of the same kind, just with different stats. all changes you made to it get lost in the process (transmutation, upgrades).
---
naturally you can customize the new item just as much as the original one.
---
You can tag the boss without killing it and you'll get the loot when zerg kills it. Everything would be much simpler if people could cooperate instead of doing what they are doing.
---
You forgot graphics engine update.
---
No, it's really not. In single player RPGs you get for example achievements, super strong equipment, or huge gold rewards for clearing an intended hard challenge. 
---
Fighting games let you unlock new characters, skins or stages to play on when you beat challenges. 
---
Shooters and mobas offer ranks, prestige, skins or other sorts of exclusive cosmetics for being in the higher ranks.
---
Card games give you unique cards or cosmetics for clearing challenges. 
---
Roguelikes give permanent upgrades or different ways to play for certain challenges.
---
Literally nearly every genre of game rewards you for clearing hard content in it. MMOs seem to be the only one where people are so against specific parts of the game being challenging or offering unique rewards, even though there's still the other 99% of the game.
---
So far no BLC exclusive skins have been added to the vouchers and there is no indication that they ever will be.
---
I think you’re misinterpreting the context of what I was saying. Also that is hugely incorrect. Rewards can come in all shapes and sizes. It doesn’t have to be gear and gold. Rewards can be achievements (see Dark Souls for those who seek the challenge to complete the game to 100%) or a special cutscene/story option for beating rough section with multiple requirements (see Witcher 3 or Deus Ex). Rewards can even be getting higher rank statuses or unique skins (see Halo 3 Hyabusa armor, LoL, DotA, Fortnite, PUBG) or maybe it’s that little bit extra to make the next run a little better (see Dead Cells)
---
I think anyone would agree that making a Legendary in GW2 is ‘hard work’. No their not a job doing work to get IRL compensation, but they’re working towards a very unique item with insane visuals and QoL. If someone put in the same level of effort to get a piece of gear that was either easily replaced (visually of functionally) or that everyone else got just by pressing 1, it would diminish the implicit value of that item and the journey it took to get there.
---
Want a starter build?  Here's my super cheap, (equip for around 3 gold 50 silver), super easy [PvE Weaver build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PGkAw2lJwmYSsRGJWuO+vPA-zRQUREEc4DjiEIqA8HA-e)
---
 It consists of a complete set of cheap Khilbron's Armor, a complete set of Superior Runes of the Krait also cheap, and whatever exotic sword and focus you have in inventory.
---
Oh  and the trait lines are Air (mostly for the Inscription trait), Earth,  and Weaver. Bottom line, you use Earth/Earth Sword (especially sword 3) +  Glyph of Elemental Power + Primordial Stance to apply a ton of bleeding  (about 20 to 30 stacks easily).  Earth shield adds extra bleed and extra shielding as needed
---
Use  Earth Focus skills + Inscription trait + Bolstered Elements trait +  Stoneheart trait to give you condi cleanse, projectile reflect, a few  seconds of invulnerability, protection, stability, and 100% avoidance of  critical hits. Also I added an Earth Elemental pet to tank for you.
---
Bottom line is you do insane bleeding damage while taking very little damage yourself.  You keep your attunements in Earth/Earth which experienced Ele's will mock, but like I said it's a starter build.
---
Sounds like ffxiv to me where dungeons and trials are intertwined with the story. Very well done and a good suggestion
---
If the progress bar gets longer, the 'filled' part would get longer as well, e.g. 5% from the shorter bar would seem 'shorter' than 5% in a 'longeer' bar.
---
Currencies should be the same, but some specific rewards should be different (this already happens in both fractals and raids with some special skins/minis/gizmos which can only be obtained through challenge motes).
---
Also, lot of people buys raids, so who cares, really? By the time easy mode players get the rewards, they would no longer be prestigious, since the novelty would wear off far before that.
---
I am extremely casual lol. I have the best gear in the game, and when I log in next time I will STILL have the best gear in the game, for forever. Now, it is possible that the best stats for my classes get changed (maybe I go from direct damage, to dot damage). So the next time I log in, I spend a little gold/time to farm up some tokens, swap my armor's stats, boom, best gear again lol. I can even use my gear on my alts (of the same armor class). The gear can even be obtained entirely solo. I crafted all mine, at my own pace.   
---
Basically, you play this game to look pretty, and the numbers come easy (or at the very least, with a little patience, and you never have to seek out bigger numbers).
---
This is just all 'perfect world' stuff without looking at the sacrifices that would need to be made for it.
---
Different types of content are designed so differently that just trying to convert a single player story instance to a replayable 5 man dungeon would require an entire rework to be good.
---
ANet already showed that they really cannot support even more content types without sacrificing support for other content. 2v2 is the most recent example.
---
When you take the shroom you technically become Sloth's ally so everything that buffs players will buff the boss as well.
---
Nope, you've got it backwards.  If the bar got longer and the percentage completed stayed the same, both the filled and unfilled sections would be longer, retaining the same proportion; your pic showed that not only did the bar get longer, the percentage filled went DOWN.
---
It's truly annoying that ANet went through the trouble of programming them as outfits instead of just more armor pieces.
---
Been saying it for years. ArenaNet is incredibly stupid and harmful to the game by not implementing difficulty modes, specially for raids. Hell, I would go even further, and bring back GW1's districts, with actual open world PvE hard mode as well, but that's an entirely different topic.
---
Anyway, [here's an official forums thread about raid difficulty modes,k including a poll](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/18677/do-raids-need-easy-normal-hard-difficulty-mode-merged/p1). It's the biggest thread on the forums, with more than 90 pages.
---
Depends on your goal. If it is PvE or/and accomplishments, enjoy the game and view. There is no rush. No one  **behind** in PvE.
---
Fighters hardly lock away characters, skins, or stages. Smash has 75 characters, and you can have them all on day one if you just play through the story. DBFZ only locks away a handful, and those are also accessible via a story clear or preorder. Shooters and MOBAs give skins but they have no mechanical advantage. Card games I'll give you, but they're trying to emulate the gacha nature of the original. 
---
End of the day, a game should be fun because you enjoy playing the game. I have 400+ hours logged on Ultimate in less than a year, and my save file is almost identical to how it was the day I unlocked the last of the roster. If you need to be bribed with loot then it's not a game anymore, just an office simulator
---
I know the only real example of story scaling, we have of story CM is Mordremoth as final boss of HoT. I don't know what the feedback or reaction was to that, but we didn't get a CM against Balthazar as final boss of PoF, which leads me to believe that that part of the content wasn't really recognized by the community.
---
It's been discussed extensively every time. There are enough reasons why it's not as simple as 'just do difficulty modes for everything' that show up time and time again in threads. If you ignore all that through, then sure it's not been discussed.
---
That's not reading comprehension.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_comprehension
---
"...knowing meaning of words, ability to understand meaning of a word from discourse context, ability to follow organization of passage and to identify antecedents and references in it, ability to draw inferences from a passage about its contents, ability to identify the main thought of a passage, ability to answer questions answered in a passage, ability to recognize the literary devices or propositional structures used in a passage and determine its tone, to understand the situational mood (agents, objects, temporal and spatial reference points, casual and intentional inflections, etc.) conveyed for assertions, questioning, commanding, refraining etc. and finally ability to determine writer's purpose, intent and point of view, and draw inferences about the writer (discourse-semantics)."
---
So in other words, reading comprehension of your post would result in the impression that you are overly combative and incorrect in your interpretation of the overall discourse of the two parent comments you were comprehending.
---
**Reading comprehension**
---
Reading comprehension is the ability to process text, understand its meaning, and to integrate with what the reader already knows. Fundamental skills required in efficient reading comprehension are knowing meaning of words, ability to understand meaning of a word from discourse context, ability to follow organization of passage and to identify antecedents and references in it, ability to draw inferences from a passage about its contents, ability to identify the main thought of a passage, ability to answer questions answered in a passage, ability to recognize the literary devices or propositional structures used in a passage and determine its tone, to understand the situational mood (agents, objects, temporal and spatial reference points, casual and intentional inflections, etc.) conveyed for assertions, questioning, commanding, refraining etc. and finally ability to determine writer's purpose, intent and point of view, and draw inferences about the writer (discourse-semantics).Ability to comprehend text is influenced by reader's skills and their ability to process information. If word recognition is difficult, students use too much of their processing capacity to read individual words, which interferes with their ability to comprehend what is read.

So I haven't played in 4\~ years. I have a Level 80 Mesmer with full Assasin Crit Reflect build. Apparently I'm doing 300 dps in fractals T1.... are base mesmers not good?       
---
Is there a class that doesn't need specialization to have high DPS in fractals?
---
&gt;Raids will die without difficulty modes. We'll get 1 raid more if we're lucky, and it will be a clown fiesta with no real challenges, all thanks to those against difficulty modes.
---
That's just a non sequitur. You've got nowhere near enough information on the topic and only basing stuff like this on your own assumptions.
---
If casual people wanted to play easy mode raids they'd do W4, W7 and bosses like escort. You cannot make raids much easier than that without dumbing them so much that you're basically not even raiding anymore.
---
Even in fractals difficulty modes don't seem to work that well. SR is a perfect example. It's designed to be casual and difficult at the same time, and the result is that it's absolute shit in all modes. Too hard for lower tiers, horribly designed for T4.
---
Most "grammar Nazis" aren't even qualified to be doing it. As a linguist and grammarian, pretty sure I can make the call.
---
Yesterday I joined a Xera 30kp squad. I said i have EH Title and overall 1300+ LI (i throw kp's away), Commander kicked me instantly. Actually Im not mad about it, block Commander an move forward. I do every week FC with my static, so i don't care about ppl like this. Just joined to have some fun in raids but nowadays ppl are very salty more then ever.
---
Same applies to griffon and beetle then probably even moreso, and the effort to get them is not comparable at all.
---
Great guide, thanks for sharing :)
---
Impossible but secretly hoping for an expac with Bubbles and Tengu with build templates, WvW alliances September 2019.
---
This is wintersday quest. You need to wait for santa
---
It’s only active during Wintersday.  So you will have to wait until December. :(
---
So my other sigil is accuracy and given the option I'd rather lose 5% damage over 7% crit chance
---
That is correct, you become allied with sloth so anything that is placed and can buff him does (banners, timewarp, wells, etc) and anything that could trigger on enemies triggers on your teammates (Dragonhunter traps are fun). Usually first shroom is BS to get it done quick then they are in position to drop banners and start DPSing, you wouldn't want them to grab first again after a full rotation if it takes that long.
---
Duels by right clicking a person
---
A la wow .
---
But a regular story mode in gw2 would work with 5 dps, just like dungeons. So if something like the random duty finder with some extra rewards for incentive also gets implemented queues shouldn't be that long
---
This is one of the problems I've seen others note before too.  There is a lot of content that Anet made related to the story that you simply can't replay.  Can you imagine how much it cost the company to do the Kralkatorrik fight?  The models, animations, effects, sound, etc.  Its a lot.  Mount models alone cost the company a lot of money as noted by several devs.  You look at that and wonder why they put so much time and money into something that won't be seen more than once.
---
It makes me wonder if they thought of this and if so, why didn't they proceed to do it?  Money?  Do they really only want fractals to be the end game 5 man content?  It just seems weird.
---
Rewards wouldn't even be that hard either.  Just make them drop the same items they already have put into reward tracks from WvW/PvP.  Just like at the end of a dungeon, give map currency and some volatile or unbound magic.
---
Yeah, if you want to make horrible difficulty modes a la Migraine, Sirens Reef, Key of Ahdhashim or Bastion of the Penitent. Nobody is satisfied with any of them. It's content designed in a certain way, then adjusted to be for other people at the expense of every difficulty mode.
---
I use gw2launcher, but not exactly to load games.  They have an command line argument you can place in Target and put -update "&lt;Folder Location&gt;\\*.dat"  And it'll update all .dat files inside of that folder.  So with LaunchBuddy sometimes messing up and not properly updating .dat files, I have to go to gw2launcher to force the update on them.
---
The only non-elite spec that is meta in fractals is [banner warrior](https://discretize.eu/builds/warrior/banner-warrior). You could get away with good builds on other classes (like base guardian) that would hit very close to meta DPS numbers if you wanted. I would highly suggest getting the expansions when they next go on sale as well (maybe the end of this month).
---
Queues would still be shit. Your story progression would be locked behind the willingness of other players to enable you to do that.
---
Ypi should know that you could make 750+ tolkens in 10 minutes by doing all adventrues in gold time limit.
---
Its not complete at all.
---
Dude, I so agree with you. The main thing I see on reddit is everyone wants a cock competition and doesnt even play the game anymore for an rpg its all about getting things for free or farming for gold to get gold prince alberts.
---
I wonder why that is. Enemies seem to die too fast to make full use of flame uprising's extended duration or they run out of it
---
If it was truly that worth it then people would do it though?
---
And that's still specifically smash and your idea of fun again. 90% of single player games beg to differ.
---
even if I personally like this. they stopped for totally legitimate reasons
---
story wise sure. gameplay wise? You kidding? we got side dungeons, the whole lions arch attack, scarlets fight, the marionette, the entire tower of nightmares instance, including what turned into one of the best fractal fights in the game because the fight was well done. The world changed from our actions, I mean seriously comparing that to the current seasons, if we had a choice id pick that every day of the week.
---
That amount of champions was not intended.
---
A while back they changed scaling to produce veterans instead, but it didn't affect all events equally.
---
When they find an event that is producing too many champions, they will note it and eventually fix it.
---
I find these type of posts funny in that people always conveniently forget the ingame things you do have to work hard for, say like the Skyscale collection, or the legendary trinkets, that in no way involve loot boxes or gemstore purchases in any way.
---
We need this 1-2 devs too. Sorry
---
The dungeon stuff was great, but all of the open world stuff (including marionette) was hot garbage
---
&gt;Raids will die without difficulty modes
---
Whatever will be released to fit abilities of those, who couldn't start raiding [s]at w7[/s] back at w4 won't be raids.  They might as well be dead at that point, rather than being champ trains packaged in 10ppl instances.  What is even the point, people aren't raiding not because bosses have too much hp or deal too much damage, but because they are too snowflaky to grasp the whole concept of coordinated group content with roles and personal responsibilitites.
---
 And even more, it would dillute the experience in "harder" versions of the same raid, because it is completely impossible for any kind of scaling to uplift "casual" braindead content to some kind of decency. This was already brought up many times in thise very hread, so I won't repeat it. And on top of that it would inevitably make  the release candence of raids even slower. Easy mode raids are out of the question. 
---
It also deserves a special mention that  people consider repeatable raid CMs non-existent for the sole reason that these only provide one-time rewards, but ask for non-rewarding easy modes. Yeah, sure as fuck that would work out.
---
have you seen the dhuum chair? and all the raid weapons and armors??
---
I didn't ping KP
---
I mean for sure he asked for 30kp, but as i said i told him i have EH and over 1300+LI so instantly kick me. Well if he don't want my help i don't mind, but i still blocked him xD
---
An easy mode raid would become dead content without rewards.  
---
I like what fractals did. Rewards are scaled down for lower levels, such as getting 1 chest per tier of difficulty. I don't see why raids couldn't use something similar.
---
I’m a relatively new player to FF14 and I’ve had very little issue getting into lower level dungeons. Between the daily roulette system an the khloe books (both of which would be wonderful ideas to add to GW2.) there’s almost always a wealth of players to pull into obscure dungeons/trials.
---
yeah but these meme ad-hoc songs are way better than those normie structured songs
---
spears on land anet pls ;(
---
On what sites can I look up builds? Snow Crow only seems to have Chronomancer guides
---
I feel like this is the least we can expect.
---
If the bar got longer to accommodate more needed kills, then the absolute length of the segment filled would remain the same, unless they are simultaneously increasing the amount needed, lengthening the bar, AND reducing the scale...in which case, it's a crime against UI design.  But since there's no numbers or hard information provided, there's no way to tell.  
---
Regardless, the bar is  behaving like it's bugged, so let's just assume it IS bugged instead of the devs making a bunch of intentional, inadvisable, random, and incomprehensible changes the event in progress.
---

My computer is almost 10 years old and it runs DX12 and Windows 10 just fine. This was an excuse 3-4 years ago. It's hard to believe that a large portion of the player base is made up of people using a no longer supported version of Windows on a 15+ year old PC.

Such good combat system to waste, really sad
---
As a pretty hardcore raider, I would LOVE to see easymode raids added to the game. Providing an accessible entry point for new players, and a way to "hook" players into the fun of group content, is crucial to maintaining a healthy and populous endgame community.
---
I see people all the time wanting to get into raiding, but lacking an easy entrypoint to try out the gamemode. As an example, look at the Frosty raid in the Secret Lair of the Snowmen. I did the fight every day with my Voice in the Void title displayed, and I would receive tons of whispers afterward saying, "oh my god, that was my first raid and that was SO FUN! are all raids like that? how do i get into raiding?!" The desire is there, all we need is an entry point.
---
You have to sacrifice something to gain another benefit. Whether it's gear upgrades, trait or skill. It all depends on what you're playing and what fits your playstyle, but for general pve content you shouldnt bother about any of these because the content is too easy.
---
The way they're going now, I genuinely think that Elite specs have a shelf life and that they'll have to do something different to iterate anymore. Regardless of the amount of work it would be, it would expand the various classes more significantly than new elite specs would. (While at the same time creating possibilities for more elite specs.)
---
And a black lion key for 20 random viewers!
---
You also used 4 periods in an ellipsis so I wouldn't really trust you with anything language related, lmao.
---
Both those sentences mean the same thing, is probably and may are just synonyms.
---
the large amount of difficulties for content in WoW has been a pretty massive disaster for the long term health of the game and its systems. I dont want that for GW2.
---
I has small peepee but big brain
---
c'mon man :(
---
Please go actually look at how they're built. They literally cannot simply be cut into 6 pieces. They are not sized the same way as armor skin's and cannot be mapped onto armor meshes.

---
I don't knoooooow - Can you repeat the question?
---
God, I loved that series...
---
 its the cherry on top of everything that is path of fire and living world season 4, its not supposed to be easy to get. is 250 a hell of alot? yeah. is it really stupid that you get 25 from istan hearts and only 5 from the rest for no discernible reason? hell yes. but the truth is i use this mount more than any other one now. all the mounts that i still have hotkeyed are now secondary to this one, and its the only one i will ever buy the 2k skin for because of how useful the mount is. sometimes i look at that skin and think to myself how gross it feels to have spent money on something other people will look at and sense no prestige or awe from it, but i can dye it subtly and not feel like im showing off while still having supported anet. i think the skyscale was absolutely perfect for this game, for an mmo community. ESPECIALLY considering out of 8 mounts its the only one thats like this, and its not even the fastest mount. i think it was a good compromise even if it did absolutely suck while i was doing it
---
&gt; Also you would still be able to play on dx9 even if there was dx12 support.
---
You mean, that Anet would still support both dx9 and dx12?  
---
Don't think that would be the case since it increases the amount of work.
---
While i also agree with the dungeon stuff the open world stuff appeared flat, boring and incredible (beside the boss flights) uninspired to me.
---
Putting the game back to pre PoF state
---
Amazon right shows windows 10 home usb for $101 for full and $89 for OEM.
---
10v10 is fine for raids. Hell, good teams are doing raid challenge modes with 5 men. People wouldn't be a problem.
---
8/30 is the only thing that'll put people to rest.
---
I do dailies for rewards:
---
Easiest adventures to gold (salvage pit, leyline run etc).
---
Bloodstone Fen et al daily achievements (except anything that requires a boss kill unless the map is populated). 
---
When I have time on the weekends, map meta events give the most exp, so preferably Tarir or DS for loot on top of exp. 
---
I never spend all day just grinding mastery xp because it's just not worth it for me.
---
&gt; If casual people wanted to play easy mode raids they'd do W4, W7 and bosses like escort. You cannot make raids much easier than that without dumbing them so much that you're basically not even raiding anymore.
---
Those are not "easy mode". You greatly overestimate people's abilities.
---
Fractals are working fine, since everyone plays them, from casuals to dedicated to hardcores. That's how a game mode survives.
---
Game hasn't been out 10 years...
---
Yeah, sure. What suits you best.
---
Better water content with a overhaul of the combat system. Huge missed opportunity to me.
---
Yeah that's why the vouchers are there so infrequently.
---
Not really, the goal of an easy mode is to either let people see the story, or let them train before moving to normal mode.
---
But yeah, that was an assumption. Ideally, I would implement the same system as fractals, with unique rewards exclusive to the higher modes. The ideal reward for easy mode is to give 1 LI for clearing the whole wing (normal and hard players would get it too).
---
I really hope it's Vulkan instead. Will run better on the existing Mac client and will be way easier to port over to, or at least run through wine/proton, on linux.
---
Oh im sure they want to milk that 15 gem difference
---
People running old hardware shouldn't be a reason for holding back the game.  
---
FFXIV dropped ps3 support a while ago and it was the only reason the game could properly move forward.
---
&gt;. What kind of dilution are you talking about? We already crossed that point long ago.
---
You are way too optimistic. Raids are still complex, raids still have roles and require group compositions and specific builds. In some places. It is actually more intricate and structurised than older wings. It just isn't tight at all. (This leads to a funny effect when people who are successfully farming q2 weekly still don't understand quite a few of it's mechanics. Just because they were never forced to care).
---
 Go look at the recent "casual" content, dragonssomething meta, which is actually somewhat complex for the current openworld content, but still boils down to people doing whatever they want (thus mostly nothing) and barely using any verbal communication. Raids designed with "easy" mode in mind would be this at their core.
---
&gt;You train in easy mode
---
Oh please. Would you really expect to get a group of 10 people for pure training, with zero expectation to get a proper kill out of it? Go ask people who used to do training raids about what happens in those "trainees'" heads. 
---
&gt;Challenge modes are pointless because they lead nowhere, that's why.
---
Ugh? How do you expect anything in this game to "lead" anywhere? Should CMs drop higher ilvl gear or what?
---
Where is Vulkan/DX12?
---

Embrace the downed skills...

The worst thing about being an Ele, is eventually you will be facing a handful of enemies, go down, lava font will res you, then you go down instantly, then the second tick of lava font reses you, then you go down again, and get resed on the third tick, then finally you just full die. No skills can help when this happens, your skill bar just flashes a few times...
---
~~tl~~ worthless;dr
---
&gt;But when you change the stats...
---
When you stat swap ascended weapons with the mystic forge (like everything else forge related) the items you put in are destroyed and the forge creates a new items to give to you. So the new item would be w/e colour it is supposed to be.
---
True, I'm just trying to min/max my give-n-take
---
Stupid idea and you know why:
---
It will take a lot development time making alle the different difficulty modes. And at the end we will get less new content.
---
You can play WoW. They have enough difficulty modes. GW2 don't have to follow them
---
Honestly most people are waiting for the announcement on the 30th.
---
It's like the most beginner friendly, casual game ever.
---
Unless you want to trihard it. Which you can do, but its optional.
---
World bosses still happen, they might not be on LFG but they follow the same schedule they have for all those five years you've been around, so you can just go to the next world boss in line and there'll be people there.
---
With the current champion rush event, I've popped into some odd maps to try to find isolated champions here and there, and there have always been other players around.  Be it Iron Marches, Lornar's Pass, Sparkfly Fen, there were always at least a few other players at each event, if not more.  The players are there, you just need to look for them.
---
The problem I have with whole "give everyone the same loot just some earn it faster" Is it devalues the achievement of the "hardcore" player and asks the "casual" to just show up enough times to get the same reward. Everyone can already earn the same loot and rewards... you just have to put in the effort to get it. Its not even a unreasonable amount of effort to do raids or CMs. It is just scary sounding at first and asks you to put your team first before your need to play how you want(bad selfish builds) or rp'ing or w/e. 
---
Every step of the way where gw2 seems difficult at first gets easier over time as you stop looking at it as difficult content because in reality its only as difficult as you (and your team) make it.
---
&gt;You are just **emberassing** yourself.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;In a few years, when you are old enough, you'll value the lessons I **tought** you here.
---
Well, my dear, I definitely won't value your horrible spelling lmao.
---
You're forgetting the most important thing which destroys all of your own points. **You WILLINGLY chose to spend money on the expansions**. Anet made it completely clear what was going to be in the expansions; New elite specs, New story, New Maps. That's what they said they would give, and that's what they gave. Cash shop has always had cosmetic skins, that was true before and it's still true now. They said before the original game even launched that the cash shop would have cosmetic items that you can't get ingame. You still bought it.
---
It's your fault that you chose to spend money and assumed you would get more than you paid for. It's your fault that you chose to pay for content that "wasn't worth it", because you were told what you were getting and you still bought it. Do you go to restaurants, order food, eat it all, then say it wasn't worth your money and ask for more? Tbh I wouldn't even be surprised if you did. I bet you never tip either. Only a entitled worm spends money on something and expects more than what they paid for at the moment of sale.
---
If FF is worth your money, and you would be willing to pay a subscription fee if the content was worth it, and Gw2 is not providing you the quality content you want and has failed to do so for years, **WHY THE FUCK DON'T YOU FORGET ABOUT GW2 AND JUST PLAY FFXIV??** You already admitted earlier that to you 30€ is a lot of money, so obviously it still comes down to you not wanting to spend money (i.e freeloader alert). If that wasn't your problem, there's literally zero reason for you to be here and not playing ffxiv. And guess what? There's a trade off for that, Gw2 is cheaper which is why people like you play it, so obviously gw2 will have less content because it doesn't receive **millions every month from subscription fees**. The subscription fee infers consistent additional content, a single purchase only gets you what you paid for at that moment. Which part of that is so hard for you to understand? Every player in ffxiv is worth at least 10€ every month, and ffxiv still has a massive cash shop filled with exclusive skins and emotes and even auto-levelling job boosts so it makes a ton of money from that on top. As we've already established, players like you are worth virtually nothing to Anet.
---
There's literally no way you can make a fair comparison between the two games unless you suffer from "retardation" (That's the correct way to spell it btw, the irony of you messing up that word wasn't lost on me there).
---
&gt;Maybe your mom was a heavy alcoholic when she was pregnant with you. It's great that we integrate challenged people into society. But it's not my job to take your hits and not blow back. That, my dear, would be your job because you started it. In a few years, when you are old enough, you'll value the lessons I tought you here.
---
I feel like after you wrote this you were so proud of yourself lol you probably punched the air and said got em. Sorry but this is just edgy and embarrassing af and looks like something a 12 year old dreams of saying to the school bully while he's crying in his bed. Even if my mum was literally a drug addict, that would mean she still somehow raised someone who works harder and has more money than you lol, I wonder what that would say about your own upbringing, my dear? 
---
My original point will always be true; If you were swimming in money and 30€ was inconsequential to you, the price of optional cosmetic skins in a video game wouldn't matter. Ergo, my dear, all of your problems would be solved if you weren't a cheap and lazy entitled bastard. Go get a job and earn the things you want, my dear, like the rest of us.
---
You shouldn’t get ahead of yourself, this is just to generate hype for the upcoming announcement and hopefully future plans, so potential new people coming to the game will have lots to do and the negativity by people will have already been pacified. I’d say to check here in 3-5 months and see if these events still roll or not.
---
Go look at Runescape and you'll see the consequences of sucking up to people using half a laptop and expecting to be able to game
---
What times do you usually play?  I feel like there are always people around when I play, but that's because I usually hop around during reset.  Also if you just started up again within' the past few days, the Festival of the Four Winds might've been the cause or the current Champion rush which is pulling people from regular metas.
---
There are a couple of skills you can learn to abuse. Earth Sigil of storms for a big blinding field and air 2 and 4 (sw/d) combined with vision blockers, to blow individual enemies up and run back to safety.
---
U guys should do that erp thing tpot is hosting
---
&gt; They are already hiring for another background project
---
they still have at least one of their projects when the layoffs happens and thinking they wouldn't hop into the mobile game train at some point would be insane since more then half of the gaming industry already comes from it and its rising more and more....
---
I think it's more they are so scared of how WoW classic is going to decimate their population and they are scrambling to make their game sound more interesting.
---
I think this is the first time I’ve seen both sides being downvoted in the samw thread
---
&gt; I agree Anet is the best at communicating with their community
---
i think you meant bad
---
I might be remembering it wrong but I believe prud is already part of it :D
---
Let's have a cursory glance at the LFG then... RIBA 40 people, champ train 34 people, world wide champ train 36 people, Auric basin west 31 people, Dragon's Stand 9 people, Lake Doric leather farm 14 people, Dragonfall 17 people, bunch of extra groups with less than 10 people for other open world content, 3 non-selling raid groups looking for more, 3 T4 fractal groups, 7 varied dungeon groups.
---
So... as a little midnight snapshot of the EU servers, that's a fairly reasonable array of groups you can join. I checked the NA servers as well and they were a little more sparse for LFGs, but not much more. In any case, I see plenty of people running around doing things in pretty much any map I go to, it's rare to find an event you can do alone unless it completes real fast, and the LFG blatantly isn't dead. I'm honestly not sure what you're doing to find so few people.
---
As long as they also leave outfits as they are, and just give the skins as additional armor unlocks. The outfit system with free switching between them is highly superior to the transmutation charge cost for switching between armor skins.
---
Not really. A lootbox is a lootbox is a lootbox. You might find people using language more consistent with the in-game name (booster packs, battle chests, crates, and what have you), but "lootbox" can be used as a blanket statement for the most part.
---
PvE legendary armor with legendary-tier skins (i.e. not like WvW or PvP "legendary" armor) that doesn't require any instanced group content.
---
Best solution is to not buy anything on the gemstore.
---
If it's anymore than LS5 with some new qol features Ill be very surprised.
---
what early they still had one other project after their layoffs

I didn't realize that the duration bonus from persisting flames was a static +2 seconds. That effectively doubles the duration of Flame Uprising, which doubles it's damages

I worked my way through FFXIV on new characters about 3 separate times, one for each release (ARR, and then the two following expansions.) 
---
My first time around I played mainly DPS, dungeon waits did take like an hour but there was so much to do while I waited, that didn’t interrupt the queue, that it was really a non-issue. I never felt like I was just standing still waiting, I could work on leveling other classes and crafts, I could continue side questing or even main questing up to a point. I could do fates and such, I could garner mats. 
---
My second time through I mainly played healer, queues were about 15 minutes average, my queues popped so fast that it felt more practical to just stand still and wait. We also had just gotten the Golden Saucer, so often times I would just gamble while I waited.

My third time around I played mainly tank. Queues as a tank were literally instant, there was almost never a wait. Queues popped so fast that I would often have to take a break from instanced content so that I wouldn’t be so overleveled all the time.
