Huh, that's quite interesting. Thanks for the video.

Core Guard hammer questions. (Several just to be clear about details).
---
1. What does Mighty Blow do?
---
2. What does Glacial Blow do?
---
3. What does Glacial Heart (skill) do?
---
4. When does Glacial Heart (skill) proc/activate? How do you use Glacial Heart (skill)?
---
It's never occurred to me and now I won't unsee that xD
---
I think it's more the price, a heck of lot more than 50 USD for a legendary weapons.
---
To what extent did they update the AI? What exactly changed there?
---
I bought a box at a local store with that exact picture on it. It was 30 EUR at the time. I believe it was in 2008. That was my second account actually.
---
wrong subreddit link. No 1.
---
Except for The Complete Collection that they haven't sold for like 8 years.
---
Here is a sloppy rundown.  I think it's worth a read!  Rytlock is hiding away from the others reflecting on the loss, wondering why people are not angry and are only crying.  He goes over how he was bullied as "Runtlock" as a cub and how he fought back against that, then how he got Sohothin and all of those he feels he failed or left behind along the way such as Snaff and Glint, that he will always truly be "Runtlock" and was using the sword to prove otherwise.  He thinks of how he never learned from his recklessness until being tricked by Bathazar, lamenting that all of that was his fault too.  He thinks of the world ending and regrets not knowing his cubs, despite checking up on them from time to time.  Finally wondering if his oldest would even think of him as the world ends pushes him over the edge into tears and he understands why the others are crying for Aurene: she was like their daughter.  Logan catches him and tries to give him Sohothin.  After taking some very long pauses to settle himself, Rytlock says he doesn't need it.  Logan tries to make him take it but reminds Rytlock the others need them and Rytlock leaves the sword (presumably just for a time) as they go to join the others.
---
I bought it at a local store for 30 EUR in 2008 or something.
---
40 dollars hahahahaha yeah no
---
I know there's some controversy, but isn't this technically the cheapest GW1 has ever been? You used to have to buy each pack separately. Even on Steam you had to buy the trilogy + eotn, which I think was $45.
---

---
This bundles everything, including some of the /bonus items. I think this is a good deal, considering the amount of content you get.
---
Imo it's likely due to a couple small things that add up. 
---
1.) Inability to reliably flank the boss negates a lot of Thieves dps due to Twin Fangs.
---
2.) Constant incoming damage means your Scholar uptime will be mediocre at best in most pugs.
---
3.) The 7% boost from Impact sigil not being activated might have a very minor role to play as well, though this is also present on many other bosses.
---
4.) Mirage specifically is rediculousy good on this fight due to Confusion/Torment procs.
---
5.) Condi damage is always good damage unless the boss phases; it could be more a matter of Condi not facing as many problems on Matt as other fights.
---
6.) It's not *as much* better than power classes; the top tier raiders use condi here regularly for reliability and as such the majority of average players copy it. (Same thing is at play when people enforce two Druids only for healers, where one Druid and an off-heals would result in significantly higher effective health-per-second at little to no cost of squad dps.)
---
In short, it's not just one reason, but more multiple reasons that are individually present on many other fights, just amassed enough on one particular encounter to tip the scales in favor of condi over power.
---
I want a Cantha expansion precisely b/c they can potentially get really creative with it. Cantha was already massively built up in GW1, imagine what they could do with it in GW2.
---
For example, maybe Cantha continued growing and developing in the 250yrs since GW1 and is even larger and more complex now. Like something as multi-layered and explorable as Verdant Brink and Tangled Depths but made out of buildings instead of plants. By now it would almost be like a fantasy version of [Trantor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecumenopolis).
---
Or perhaps Cantha was leveled by Bubbles/Steve and is now a ruin, and we have to explore it for survivors and clues to what do about the water dragon. Given how massive it was in GW1, a ruined version of it could be pretty interesting to explore too.
---
Either way there's plenty opportunity for creativity with Cantha.
---
**Ecumenopolis**
---
Ecumenopolis (from Greek: οἰκουμένη oecumene, meaning "world", and πόλις polis "city", thus "a city made of the whole world"; pl. ecumenopolises or ecumenopoleis) is the hypothetical concept of a planetwide city. The word was invented in 1967 by the Greek city planner Constantinos Doxiadis to represent the idea that in the future urban areas and megalopolises would eventually fuse and there would be a single continuous worldwide city as a progression from the current urbanization, population growth, transport and human networks. This concept was already current in science fiction in 1942, with Trantor in the Foundation series.

I cared enough to ask someone who sounded like they knew something that would otherwise be kept as proprietary.  I did not care enough to go on a hunt myself.
---
Well argue with the math then. It's not an opinion at question here, it's a matter of numbers. Feel free to do some rotations on the golem taking random 5-10 second breaks if you want (and are actually willing to acknowledge) some hard evidence.
---
Interesting.. I like that.
---
Saying that 76 is harder than 100cm is not objective fact, it’s his opinion, which I disagree with. This instability benefits the group against a single boss and punishes against the group against multiple adds, it is a very unfair comparison. Completing a fractal at tier 3 isn’t an insult, there’s nothing wrong with completing something at a lower difficulty if the higher difficulty is too difficult for him because of the instability. No need to call me a cunt my dude. 
---
The thing that is in concern is the number of legendaries going into the system through this method, which has affected the economy hugely. In CN server, basically nobody farms elder wood since LS Season 3, and the six-elder statue in Malchor's Leap is basically empty there. A lot of central tyria maps are notably very empty unless there is a beetle race or guild mission.
---
World bosses are also not as attractive; globes are also cheaper. Unless some people want to get the central tyria mastery and get a 10 to 15 band together, nobody kills the Karka Queen. There are some weekend events that award people free stuff with WB kills, only then do people do WBs.
---
There are comparatively fewer enjoyable and profitable farming methods, causing people to lose incentives. Legendaries are a goal for casual players in GW2, but buying a legendary with real world money is so easy in CN that makes actually making one redundant.
---
On one side, I'm super happy they finally decided to update the GW1 store and make it more accessible, even if it's still not merged with the GW2 store.
---
Any happiness I had goes down the toilet when I see the pricing model. The whole thing should be 20€ at most. It doesn't even include the bonus mission pack.
---
Fanboys trying to excuse the price, you disgust me. This was a golden opportunity to give GW1 some life. Not gonna happen with those prices, specially when you could already get it cheaper than it is now, years ago. I myself did.
---
Stealth-bumping the prices in the EU store is pretty shady if you ask me. GW1 already had harsher monetization than GW2, how was this needed in any way whatsoever? If something, they should have closed the shop, and turn everything into ingame rewards. Remember: It's a dead game.
---
In my opinion, the best approach would have been to make it F2P for anyone who owns either HoT or PoF. The four games, plus the bonus missions. Then integrate the GW1 store inside the GW2 gem store, so you can purchase GW1 features using GW2 golds and gems, instead of having two separate stores.
---
I think this is going to be a huge missed opportunity, which makes me really sad for GW1. Way to turn something great into a huge letdown...
---
if done correctly you should notice a new 'P7logs' folder in the game's main folder
---
The game isn't region-locked, so anyone with half a brain will just purchase it from the cheapest store.
---
Or just buy it from other retailers, which have it far cheaper than this.
---
&gt; You can maybe call EOTN a DLC as it's a bit smaller and more of an add on, but it's still pretty darn large.
---
The key point here is that EotN is not playable without at least one of the other campaigns while the campaigns are all standalone. The was also reflected in EotN's release price.
---
The titles were 14.99, not 19.99, so that's a pretty big change if you ask me.
---
Thank you.
---
At this rate, I wouldn't be surprised if their next big hit is some shitty mobile game.
---
We already had that before with the old "No Pain, No Gain"
---
Have you never done a single map meta in your life
---
That would make things complicated ... is the anomaly a life form? What about golems?
---
Witcher3 is the top game at metacritic by user review, his second DLC if you can call it DLC really, is ex aequo in 3rd place. I can tell you Witcher Expansions are whole new games so it is simillar if not better. So the price is joke to me, and also many others, RE2 Remastered is worth that much and they put much love in it to restore it.
---
You won't tell me that 15 years old game should cost 40 Euros, it should not, is not worth it, and someone here also wrote about some in game items prices that went up. Anet are trying to be AAA company and taking the worst examples,  like EA, Activision and Bethesda. Nothing good will come from that. They should read about CDP Red.
---
$40 for a game that old! Thats ridiculous.
---
wowie zowie
---
in case you're actually real and not just a bad troll, look through his artstation.
---
your opinions are wrong and your understanding of the game is evidently not good enough for you to speak in any authority on this
---
The newest mastery made me come back to Verdant Brink again for just messing about. The fact that we can now leap from Griffons, catch an updraft and mount up again is just awesome, and after 20 seconds or so, you can do it again!
---
Most other T5/T6 fine crafting mats are way to cheap, only totems seem to be ok in price. Keep in mind that these items are relativly common. They drop a lot, are part of reward chest (see fractals). Playing the game should be worth it. It sucks to get loot worth 20 copper.
---
I expect new mounts more than anything else. 
---
My bets are still on the Charr homelands as our next location, so maybe we learn more martial ways while we're up there, unlocking the 2-5 skills. 
---
One of the major "we don't have that" differences is that they can craft attribute infusions. For example, you can craft a +X power infusion using t2, t3, t4, and t5 blood. You start with +1 and then it's exponential, just like the agony ones.
---
I wonder why we didn't get them here :I.
---
Teach us your secrets master!
---
Only the euro prices went up, and that is certainly because euro has fallen against the dollar in the past 5+ years.
---
Yeah but coordinating that in pugs 😅
---
Please don't confuse math for my opinions. Feel free to test it yourself, PLEASE don't take my word for it! I openly invite you to trt it yourself. If you find my statements to be false, then I readily accept an *accurate* correction.
---
Each individual game was overpriced. Compare it to the pricing of most games that age. Morrowind (including the 2 expansions) for example regularly goes on sale for $5-10.
---
Never once said 12k=10k, completely made up logic you're attempting to use in an argument.
---
Moving on, yes of course not having your damage boost abilities up while your opening burst is available will be a dps loss. But the mechanics are more likely to happen outside of their small window of activation than they are inside of it, assuming the small windows of large boosts are in fact small windows. A skilled player can further mitigate this by timing their burst buffs at a moment when they know a mechanic will not interupt them.
---
Now, do a lot of condi specs have damage amplifying effects? Unless you count the stacking condi modifier in Renegade, Warrior, Mesmer, Soulbeast, and Daredevil traitlines, no. Jokes aside, a power dps under the effects like you mentioned will do VASTLY more damage in a small window than a cDPS would apply in that same time frame. Meaning, on average over the course of a fight, the statistic say that the pDPS will suffer no more than the cDPS.
---
To try and put it even more simply: cDPS will miss out on 100k damage 100% of the time. pDPS will miss out on 200k 20% of the time and 75k damage 80% of the time.
---
I think it looks great you may consider posting your work on /r/imaginaryTyria 
---
I don't get enjoyment grinding out hero points I've gotten on 14 characters in order to unlock an elite spec i already have on another character. 
---
I have a few duplicate class characters. Example, I have a Charr Firebrand I made for POF and a Norn Dragonhunter which had been my main since launch. Personally, that makes each character unique in my mind and im able to have more of an affinity towards each character. But thats just me.
---
I know there are enough hero points in the world to cover both elites but i don't feel like doing that. 
---
It's a troll, just downvote and move on.
---
It's a million times better with updraft masteries and mounts, compared to AB which doesn't need much of anything, so I don't appreciate it that much. It's not tangled depths, and it's great with verticality in that respect but meh
---
Yep, likewise, though I just went back to other games after I moved.
---
Painful beauty... Couldn't hold myself from drawing on emotions from episode. Even tho I don't believe she died for good, she still has joko's power.
---
Weaponswap, a lot of interactable things can be canceld with weaponswap, but still  get the heart progress
---
I'm gonna be unlocking my mistlock instability mastery soon but I'm still confused on what it actually does? It makes fractals more difficult? I see some of them and it doesn't make sense at all.
---
&gt;You're wrong. Stop bullshiting. 1v1 does not exist in open world. Quitting digging a deeper hole for yourself.
---
Alright, fine. Look, I actually do appreciate you going through the trouble of writing all this purely for my sake, but there's just no point in talking about this any further if we're going to be speaking completely different languages.
---
What do you mean 1v1 does not exist in open world? Have you never done a dynamic event chain in the middle of nowhere and had to solo the boss at the end? Have you never been the only person around when you were trying to get your Hero Points in HoT? Have you never done any of the achievements that require you to kill some random champion in the middle of nowhere? Have you never just wanted to see if you could solo something for fun?
---
Going back to my very first post in this chain, I wasn't actually trying to defend Spellbreaker mechanically at all, I was making a semantic argument. You said Spellbreaker was worthless in PvE, and I wanted to make the point that because GW2 has a majority casual playerbase where only a fraction of it actually engages in high end PvE content like raids and fractals, the fact that Spellbreaker was at least *functional* in the open world meant that most players were never going to run into a situation where Spellbreaker was so bad they couldn't proceed.
---
So it wasn't worthless, it provided the "wow I'm a magic fighter dual wielding daggers" appeal and was perfectly servicable in 90% of GW2's piss easy PvE content. Monetarily, the game was better off for having it despite it's flaws, so in that sense it can't be called worthless.
---
I was never trying to deny that Spellbreaker was a PvP spec first and only half-functioned as a PvE one, our only disagreement is that I think it at least *half* functions.
---
Full Counter might not be Endure Pain in terms of a defensive cooldown, but it's still a powerful defensive cooldown that can be used to save a dodge by blocking an incoming hit. Speaking of dodges, not only does the Magebane Tether + Might Makes Right combo provide a Spellbreaker-specific source of continuous healing, but it's also a constant source of endurance regen. Combine that with the grandmaster minor that recharges Full Counter after a burst and Spellbreaker probably has the most consistent defensive cooldowns in the game. And keep in mind that you're still free to use Defense, Adrenal Health and Last Stand if you want to be functionally immortal.
---
This all comes in handy when you're running around and have to solo some event boss and can rotate your cooldowns to block, dodge or otherwise avoid every single one of their big attacks. It's a pretty good soloist, but what makes it into a good general open world spec is because all of that is just done with the Spellbreaker traitline and Strength, which you were probably going to use anyway. The final traitline and all of your skills are up to personal preference and what you need right now, and you can stuff it full off damage buffs, condi cleanse, self-sustain, CC or whatever exact combination you need. That's why the open world build I linked you was highly rated with a ton of variants.
---
Again, this was all I was talking about. It doesn't matter that Spellbreaker is just a backup spec for Fractals, I linked you to the open world builds because I was talking about open world gameplay.
---
&gt;So...your logic is that I'm calling a class useless BECAUSE I myself spent a lot of money on that class and by wanting it to be useless my wasted money is somehow validated...what?
---
Yeah, that was my reaction when you made up some story about how I spent thousands of gold on Spellbreaker fashion and so am so emotionally invested in it's state in the PvE meta that I feel the need to lie to defend it out of a sunken cost fallacy.
---
I mostly just wear old cultural armor, and not even the tier 3 stuff. I like to stick to each race's aesthetic when I play them, you know?
---
&gt;Half your arguments so far have been "Yeah but litterally all the people in my head were all like "oh wow this is litterally so awesome no really i swear"" to the point where has gotten comical. 
---
I mean, I don't know what to tell you. I remember watching WoodenPotatoes streaming post-PoF and seeing him go through the whole "oh spellbreaker's actually pretty good in pve" thought process I outlined earlier, sorry I don't remember the exact day that stream was or I might go look it up for you. Similarly, I *have* seen people on reddit express the same. If I remembered their names or the urls to their posts I would link them to you, but, alas.
---
&gt;Well give me the specific build you personaly use and claim isn't straight up garbage in PvE and I'll improve it by removing spellbreaker. 
---
Literally linked it to you in my last post. I personally use a variant with Arms, Signet Mastery and some signets along with dual wield and dual daggers whenever I'm just fucking around because I think it's fun, but it's only real benefit is that dual wield increases the pace of your auto attack's Might Makes Right procs, so I usually switch to Greatsword and Defense for serious stuff like soloing those bounties.
---
I'm really not sure how you could improve it by removing Spellbreaker when the entire point is using Spellbreaker to stack all of that sustain.
---
She's really gone huh?
---
It's now worse, spiking to over 1.5k ping for about 15 seconds then down to 500 for a minute or so then down to 40-50 for only 10 seconds then back up.  WTF!?
---
So you're saying those sigils/runes should use the cheaper T6 mats?
---
Wow, this looks amazing!
---
Guys, I installed GW1 on an SSD and loading screens doesn’t exist anymore.
---
The game runs so smooth that it feels very pleasant to play. Join an alliance and you will see there are still a ton of people logging in very frequently.  The game is still visually great compared to other mmos of its era.
---
I'm saying that the sigils/runes that are valuable should have their recipes spread out evenly across t6 mats so that no one mat gets out of line from the others. 
---
Sabaku no wa ore no stando da!
---
If you'd take a look at the historical price graph you linked, you'd see that Elaborate Totems have been this high (and higher) before.
---
As for "making these drops far more common", that's just gonna massively deflate prices again (T6 prices since Istan hit, ectoplasm prices since PoF hit as another example).
---
Just level up. You will find increasinglh difficult content. More so if you are in a zone of higher level than you.
---
Witcher 3 is one game. It's Witcher 1, 2 and 3 that you'd have to compare it to. This is four different games. Or at least 3 games and one expansion. 3 standalone games. 
---
On top of that, I spent about ten times more time in Guild Wars 1 for the same price as all the Witchers put together. You really can't compare a multiplayer coop game with a single player game anyway.
---
You can do everything with Heroes, even DoA and UW if you know what you're doing
---
I remember clearing the Jumping Puzzle there before Mounts are introduced. Amongst my top 3 best personal achievements.
---
Sheesh. All I am asking is is this working as intended. If it's supposed to be any damage from any source, then why call it damage from foes? Just say any flanking damage is 300% stronger.
---
This, along with the Lynx face for the female Charr.
---
Expansions aren't complete games but Factions, Nightfall and Prophecies aren't expansions. They're complete stand alone games. You never have to buy one to play the other.  Eye of the North is the only true expansion to Guild Wars 1.
---
Some people bought only Prophecies or only Factions or only Nightfall and just played that.
---

Just looking for some consistency. Don't put words in my mouth please. 
---
Anet is the developer of the game this subreddit is about...
---
Fractals give flat gold as well, the more worth these mats are, the less impact the flat gold gives you. And you just end up eating more tp tax anyways. 
---
Yea pre eureka is long..
---
As you get better gear and more AR, fractals get a little more manageable. Sometimes you shouldn't brute force a fractal, but instead watch some videos on specific fractal mechanics before practising a fractal. Best of luck!

More people in one spot the safer it is. When lake doric came out there were people farming there all the time [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOx-dxNEPY8) before it got nerfed and harder (mortar strikes now hit everywhere there). They also used to farm the spiders in bitterfrost before they had drops removed. Should also be mentioned though that full afk is against the rules and that you need to be at least attentive and checking on the game even if you're tabbing out. Engies need to place turrets every 5 min so it requires some activity for them.
---
I’m expecting a triple legendary to drop.
---
Greatsword, Coalescence, and  an amulet 
---
I think it's almost certain people will be able to finish Coalescence, which is an accessory, when the final episode drops. It'll require the precursor from W5 stuff, the Gift of Complex Emotions from W6, a Mystic Tribute, which is a standard recipe for many legendaries, and a Gift of &lt;something&gt; Mastery, which will likely require the mats from all the LWS4 maps.
---
I bought an official version like this years ago. Box and everything. It vanished afterwards and I never found it again.
---
Well i actually met a flying water shark yesterday.
---
This post is so meme, you add all the annoying returning players in one but hopefully this post stays up in the popular thread for all to see forever
---
You forget glint dye's i like several of those a lot!
---
I both play in NA and China (•_•)  
---
I like Arcane and Fear personally. Fear looks really good with the monk outfit, and arcane is just nice in general.
---
Just play the game? It’s weird you need an attachment to pixels to enjoy a game, sorry bout it 🤨
---
That's it, the bond to the characters. The hours i spent on a character while leveling up, exploring the maps, etc really make the character felt special to me. As opposed to a new one that you leveled up instantly, i felt almost nothing.  
---
I've played several classes already and interested to see how a Thief played out. The mechanic looks interesting, and Deadeye are so cool.
---
Maybe i'll try this. But i also wanted to remove the level 80 boost from the shared inventory slots.
---
Don't feel too bad about using your boost, there's a lot of value to a level 80 necro minionmancer (map completion and malchors leap farming come to mind). It's a good max alt to have
---
&gt; The Complete Collection is a pack with all games -&gt; GW (Prophecies), GW: Factions, GW: Nightfall and EOTN. Also it's the Game of the Year edition of Prophecies, which grants you some bonus stuff ingame.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Before you could buy either the trilogy (Prophecies, Factions, Nightfall), the Platinum Edition (Prophecies, EOTN) or all games seperated. So no matter which pack you bought, you always had to buy another game additional to get all. 
---
What the hell are you even talking about? [The Complete Collection was released in 2008/2009](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_Prophecies#Guild_Wars_The_Complete_Collection_.28Box_Content.29) 
---
&gt; When the game's age is concerned I am a 90s kid, so booting up old games for the sake of nostalgia is always a YES for me.
---
So basically what you're saying is that you're cool.
---
Technically mercenaries let you make more mesmer heroes, which makes everything easier.
---
With just heroes, you’re limited to 3 mesmer primaries.   Even tho this is plenty, some people love to meme the 8 mes team. 
---
Complaining here wont get your account back. You broke the ToS, fabricated or not. That's how the cookie crumbles.
---
But other people have done that to me, too. What allows them to keep their accounts?
---
I would love if it was an amulet... swapping enrichments on the fly would be great for stuffs... though it's not like I'd be saving inventory slots by doing so :V
---
I think it'll be an accessory, though. And LS5 will be an amulet. There will probably be a WvW and sPvP legendary ring to complement the (ever always) impending PvE raid legendary ring.
---
Well when it gets like this you're definitely not playing the game not the hud because you can't see the game at all lol
---
Yeah I guess that makes sense, gotta have something to work your way towards or otherwise there's not much to do for veterans.
---
No they did not, that other person really shouldn't be downvoted. They listed only four settings, and one of them (postprocessing) wasn't even set to the lowest option (off). So it's an entirely legitimate question.
---
Great, I'd love to know your results.  Thanks!
---
It is not the overall speed of the sickle you are aiming for but the moment where the node will be harvested technically. If you let the castbar run through and wait till the aftercast animation is done most of the harvesting tools are equally fast. Tools with a longer aftercast will mostly have a shorter precast and wise virsa. But that is not what you are aiming for. You will interrupt your "cast" halfway through to safe time and that is not possible with every tool. For sickles the fastes ones are  skritt, consortium or molten but I do not own every tool ingame. Keep in mind that I can only compare what I have in hand. But after all - for most players without a gathering value of tens of dozens nodes per day at minimum the difference is not that high. Definitly not that high as many seems to assume. The glyph of industry will be the main time saver most of the time not the animation canceling. 
---
Then accept the consequences of your actions, which you agreed to abide by when you signed up for the game, and quit complaining.
---
It is, however, better than no solution (if it works). You can ask for anet to change stuff and still do what you can to treat it in the mean time.
---
Are you going to repost this every eight hours?
---
No, I won't. I was just trying to avoid sounding like I'm trying to contact a support team. That's what got my last post removed. I just don't know why I got in trouble for something others got away with at my expense.
---
Anet never released in PRC, only Taiwan and Hong Kong.
---
According to the last thing Anet_Ben said that I saw, wing 7 should be out with the next LS episode.
---
The raid &amp; Fractal teams merged and they were planning on leap frogging releases along side LS releases.  LS4E4 we got wing 6, LS4E5 we got Siren’s Reef, so that slates LS4E6 to be W7.
---
We still have 152 days untill Wing 7 release on July 9th 2019. Ring will not be tied to LS. We already have placeholders for other trinkets. Amulet will require LS mats for sure just like Aurora did.
---
Talk shit get hit.
---
I have the riddle of the mirage and the riddle of the deadeye, both exotic rings, and cannot seem to throw them both in the forge together, nor can I toss in exotic accessories with them, so it seems like there is something else going on.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
That said, I don't currently have other exotic rings besides these two riddles so you may be right.
---
Do you have direct experience tossing in the riddle rings with other trinkets?
---
Starting over is gonna hurt. I've dedicated a 4th of my life thus far to this game. But you're right, I shouldn't have reacted the way I did. 
---
Just got my necro to 80, currently gearing up as scourge and went to check the Snow Crows guide. It recommends 2 torches with a torment/bursting sigil, but the guide itself makes no mention of weapon swapping.
---
Are both really necessary? If I only run with one, which sigil should I go for? If you are using 2, are you just meant to swap on cd, or is there a specific time you use one or the other?
---
Their guild spent a long time talking crap about me, too. Where's their hit?
---
I just previewed some of the "excusive" face and hair options and in my honest opinion they all look horrible, especially the faces just look so... dead?
---
To clarify: I obtained several of the "riddle of" rings for elite spec collections from the chests in Elona, and tried to toss two of them into the forge together but the forge doesn't seem to allow it. Both are exotic rings so I'm thinking there may be specific MF recipes and not just a "throw 4 of the same item type for random reward" setup.
---
I don't have exotic rings besides the riddles at the moment to test. 
---
Thanks, I hate it!
---
(This is gorgeous, what a beautiful color palette.)
---
Okay but this guy is going off like this is the be all end all, ZOMG I don't have the mercencary pack so you can't play win the game.  That's crap considering most of us probably beat all the games without a mercenary pack at all. I mean I have one and never used all mesmers.

Hey! It's a static $15/hr rate with something like this taking about 6-9 hours.

GUILD WARS IMMORTAL COMING TO YOUR PHONES IN EARLY 2020
---
Seems like the new living world trailer there only gets a few thousand views
---
About time they did a proper collection!
---
Thank you very much for this!
---
Really hoping it's not just coalescence, not a raider so don't have that collection unlocked. 
---
Regardless, should save up a stack of each map currency... though I have a distinct feeling the istan currency may be kralkite ingots and not ore...
---
What is dead may never die, and those that draw power from death itself seem to be rather averse to it. *COUGH* JOKO *COUGH
---
$40 for 4 games is not a bad deal any way you slice it. Saying it should be $20 or free is just greedy.
---
Tutorials for an mmo is a tricky subject. Inherently you are expected to explore and figure out more. 
---
Guild Wars 2 does however not really attract hardcore mmo players. It largely attracts casual gamers. Those type of gamers rarely go outside of the game to learn anything. They log on play a bit and then resume real life. 
---
Thus the reality for guild wars 2 is either you need to accept the community skill level and deal with it or promote in game resources. 
---
Personally I have a static for raids and join CM groups for fractals so the problem rarely effects me. 
---
Sweet thanks mate
---
The LS maps mostly just provide easy ways to acquire the ascended trinkets/rings/etc. The gear itself is available with the expansion alone, with crafting or other means.
---
Its 100 euro in EU
---
Totally. I see a lot of HoT metas barely scrape by these days. I love all the metas, and its hard for me to say which one I enjoy most. They're all so good. I think that the event metas are the pinnacle of good MMO design. Stuff like Tequatl too.
---
They offer a unique experience that can only be had in MMO's. And its made accessible because it relies on people acting as a hive mind rather than a super coordinated group. Everyone knows where they need to be and what they are going to be doing.
---
It's a nice refresher from the instanced content so many MMO's seem to prefer. I wish there were more reasons for people to return to HoT zones and do them.
---
Something interesting about the skull removal thing is that China is actually fine with skulls. Chinese game devs put skeletons in their games. But because they have such a heavy vetting process for imported games, anything that might even remotely seem like a problem (skulls, blood etc) are removed just so the game can cruise through without any problems. 
---
Definitely my favorite map in the game. Stepping into VB felt so unreal and different from the base game.
---
Also, I think it handles vertacality better than any other map. So many layers and levels. Its a jungle out there.
---
What people are talking about here is not the amount of games in the pack but the age of said games, selling 14-12 years old games for 40 eur is a dick move even if said games need an online server.
---
Oh ok, man, lots of stacking, but the damage is insane o.o.
---
So I met all 4 requirements according to the adjacent supply foreman, and Pepperseed just stays there cowering in fear permanently. Any thoughts??
---
Honestly I wouldn't count on it. The regular campaigns have been on Steam for years but every time a major sale hits they seem to avoid getting any discount at all :\\
---
You know that they blocked Reddit right?
---
Just play pvp unranked
---
It will give you a rough estimation of the newer classes
---
Cause you have everything unlocked in ranked 
---
You can try various builds and all without having to spent any gold at all!!!

Funny thing is while Kun is a RMT and Anet is clearly strongly against RMT.
---
Still. they pay tribute to this dude by making a named NCP after his name. Obviously they did not do much research lol
---
I hear you, however I've been dealing with a kid who had Harry Potter spoiled because she read map chat over my shoulder 2 weeks ago. Someone somewhere out there hasn't seen something that "everyone knows".
---
Yeah you were in the wrong on every single one of these posts. Take this as your official warning to not attack other users as that is against our rules and can result in temporary or permanent bans.
---
You can buy Glyphs equip them to your infinite gathering tools and you can farm all that extra booty! 
---
New campaign: Stop cyberbully on mesmer mains!
---
Fine crafting mats are still part of fractals reward system. Less valuaable T5 mats = less rewards for doing fractals. This goes for any content which rewards you with fine crafting materials, as champion lootbags or direct loot from enemies. 
---
Simple put: if the loot is shit, it's not worth playing such content. If playing the game is not "worth it" people don't play GW2. People don't spend hundreds of hours in silverwastes just because they enjoy the lovely story those events tell...
---
What do you use the unbound magic for besides unlocking LS3 abilities and maybe getting Obisidan shards?
---
Easiest and cheapest way to get full Viper is to reroll ascended Berserker equipment, that you crafted yourself, in the Mystic Forge.
---
You only need an exotic crafting Inscription/Insignia of the Stats you desire. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing
---
So if you get those Weapon/Armor Chests from Fractals or WvW you can turn them into Viper rather easily.
---
Trinkets, Rings and your Necklace can be obtained in fractals and WvW too but you need those unattuned ones tho.
---
Viper gear aquisition is fucked beyond believe.
---
I didn't say that it was needed, but that that's a possible reason for a problem
---
An pretty import point is: new players (or casual players) need gold for more rare items. Be it skins, runes, sigils, mystic coins, lodestones etc.
---
To pay for these more rare items these players often need to sell their found items. If they got 100 t5 totems in their bank and sell them it's better for them if they get 5 silver for each, instead of 50 copper. 
---
Another example are direct gold payments as for griffon (?) or cultural armour. People sold all their horded items to afford these.
---
Soo...more casual/or new players usually have to sell common loot to buy other stuff. Totems are common loot.
---
They mean the Mastery Insight high above the Pact Encampment outpost. Sadly there's no reason to repeat it after the first time
---
The map is amazing graphically, but the mob scaling in events needs looking at.  I was at a rally point, and only 3 people around, and we somehow spawned 2 champ mobs.. that doesn't seem right.
---
EVA tries to run the full T4 night meta every weekday.  It all depends on whether or not we have commanders available.  It’s the last stop of our HoT meta train that starts 12:00 pm server time in Tangled Depths.
---
Eh... There are people who charge less for better...
---
Wow, amazing!
---
In terms of meta design, I love it. The only downside is the unpredictability of rewards as it relies on cooperation (just like drytop) and the rewards are underwhelming for all that hard work)
---
she's hopped up on jokos magic, we're probably gonna ride her out of the domain of the lost like nothing happened in the next chapter 
---
Don't want to be that person but the art could have been better without that dumb backpack 
---
Nice to hear that is work on much less RAM/VRAM!
---
But anyway, if you hit point of virtual memory usage(CPU side or GPU), FPS will drop like a lot.
---
And don't forget, ingame settings affect ram/vram usage.
---
Even so, read onwards. I break down how, statistically, both are harmed equally by missing mechanics. Its gradual slopes vs sharp drops and bursts. Its simple math, i honestly dont understand why its so hard for people to see.

I actually really like Tangled Depths. It is one of the few maps that gave me a sense of exploration and discovery like in the first few MMOs I played when I was still discovering the genre. It feels huge, with so many different pathways and areas and places to come back and visit as you develop masteries and the meta event remains really satisfying.
---
I've map completed it a few times for legendaries now and while the sense of getting lost and absorbed in the world has gone, it is still a beautiful map with varied scenery that doesn't feel out of place. 
---
we each have our own endgame, and mine is being decked in purple.
---
I would like this option to be available only in raids, fractals, and dungeons for those of who do not want to deal with certain mentalities that some players have.  It would also allow those of us who are so inclined to be more efficient solo than certain PUGs.
---
Those who can't stand the idea of such a thing in an MMO don't have to use and continue to play with real humans.  This just gives choice and if you're really into min/maxing, henchmen can't compete with truly skilled human players.  
---
But in open world and PvP and WvW, I think it shouldn't be added.   That's already a solo environment or can be easily.  An environment where you already have the option of going full solo or with other real players.
---
Not that it will happen as too many players are opposed to this idea.
---
Honestly I'd love a GW1 mobile port.  The gameplay would work rather well, since the game can be almost entirely mouse driven.
---
I dont have that attachment, "characters" are interchangeable to me, they play the same no matter how you level them.
---
Yes. But by the same logic, *a sharp rise of dps is more severe than a gradual ramp upwards.* Every condi class has a ramp up time. When you leave to do a mechanic you are not only missing out on some direct damage then but soft-resetting your initial ramp up that you had at the start of the fight, where as a power class can get right back to where they were. And statistically speaking, since "small window of burst" is by definition not the most common part of a rotation to be in, the mechanics will more often than not fall into the "filler" part.
---
You forgot one of the easiest: PVP and WVW weapons and armor stat select from any stats. 
---
I've had this feeling for many characters I've boosted. I deleted over half of my characters and started to focus on ones I had most attachment to. Over time, doing dailies, achievements, LWS3 map resource farms, practicing builds, and even completing the personal story on alts has allowed me to build up attachment to other characters aside from my main. The cherry on top is finally completing a look for each of them that i'm happy with. I still haven't achieved that for a couple of them, but I just don't force it and come back to it later. Instead, I let myself play the game as it was designed to be played -- an rpg where you grow, learn, and connect with your character. So now that I've realized this and spent some time to get attached to and appreciate the characters I had, I made a new character and I've been leveling him 100% naturally with no boosts, tomes, or scrolls though I have a ton of them to use. It's honestly refreshing to experience the game from scratch as a new player would, even after playing for nearly 7 years.   
---
My Norn Ranger is now lv 48 and I've done quite a bit of map completion on him. I complete the personal story as it comes and then continue map exploration to level. Going back through maps like Wayfarer Foothills (My favorite starting map), Snowden Drifts, Lornar's Pass, Dredge Haunt Cliffs, and now Fields of Ruin, I experienced what it was like to be under-leveled for an area in Dredgehaunt Cliffs since I didn't do many events while going through Lornar's Pass. I took a break from that zone and went to Fields of Ruin for personal story and have been leveling up smoothly there before I go back. One of the wonderful things about GW2 especially is that, in going back through this content, talking to all the named NPCs, interacting with objects, or just being in the right place at the right time, the content of the world really coalesces and makes you feel like you're actually involved in the world and that builds a connection that I think is hard to find in other games. I notice dialogue options, npc conversations, and even lore bits that I never noticed back at launch.  
---
Another thing I like to do is really buy into the personal story selections. If I choose charm, I kinda roleplay that into my character. My Norn chose Raven spirit and so I remembered I have the Raven spirit glider skin for him. I chose Norn for Ranger because I think the animations for the major weapons really fit with the racial fantasy of the character and that really helps me connect to my character's sense of place in the world. I mean, this all may sound sappy for someone who has played for so long, but sometimes stopping to smell the roses and just enjoying the process is the bedrock of enjoying the overall experience. And in my particular case, it's made me love the game and my characters even more when I take the time to connect with them in more than a mechanical way.
---
Depends on the class's mechanics. If it's a pretty straight forward class, there's not much attachment to have but other than that I don't see the issue.  
---
For example; I'm interested in Holosmith but not in the actual engineer stuff you have without it - as such, boosting the character is the only way to get there without having to go through all the rest. Grinding the char to 80 (as that is how it feels to play a char with mechanics / weapons you don't like) is not an option.   
---
But an A/A warrior at lvl 20 plays hardly any different than an A/A warrior at lvl 80 - so here it doesn't matter either.  
---
Similar to a LB/Power ranger if you don't go for the spec classes..
---
But if you want to play say a mesmer with all the mechanics it comes with, I don't recommend to boost it because you'll feel lost and detached from it. It's "too new".  
---
Same I guess with a Necromancer. 
---
i do it by picking up one, waiting for rabbit to come out, drop food, scare him, and repeat
---
i think in that order can't tell for sure, been a while since my last map comp
---
That won't prevent me to explore and complete personal story with them. But that is ... a distant goal.

I have exotic staffs for them...I just want to craft an ascended staff; but I play both specs as needed in the group. Good point about the sigil...maybe a sigil of concentration and the one that puts 10% onto conditions, (name escapes me just now)...but yes it will be a bastardized weapon no matter what.

*Hall of Monument Portal Stone Route

You did a good effort, and I appreciate it.
---
The thing I love about this map was that I hated it at the start. This is the only map that you actually have to explore to get around. All others are just flat.
---
Let's meet and discuss this at disco cave.
---
I believe the subreddit has a specific rule that spoilers are to be avoided in titles and tagged for the first 28 days of the release. Its now more than that, and its still spoiler tagged and a fairly vague title, so you are browsing on your own risk...

Could be just a chat code.
---
Yeah, I think deleting the dodge is just extreme. 
---
I have good lag xD
---
The complexity of it just boggles your mind. But as you grow accustomed to it, learn the terrain, map it out in your mind and start using hidden pathways and the shortest of cuts, it really shines and gives you that sense of an experienced adventurer - you feel like one of those local guides in games who give you an advantage while traversing deep jungles or mountainous regions, knowing the land like the back of his hand.  
---
But there is one glaring problem - there are simply too many monsters. They actively prevent you from exploring to your heart's content unless you want to kill a mob every 10 meters. Even just running past them is sometimes not an option - those shadowstepping pigs for example oneshot your mount with the 'flurry of teleporting strikes' attack, and it's even worse if you don't have a mount in the first place.

I do not know him, but as someone that relates to mental illness battles and loss of a loved friend due to this, my heart goes out to his family and all of his GW2 and RL friens :(  I'm so so sorry for your all's loss, he sounds like he was a very wonderful man.  May he rest well...thank you for sharing this story.
---
I do hope a tribute can be made in-game for him, like another posted earlier, that would be really sweet especially given the impact it seems he's made.
---
If the application would not crash on launch for me I would do it this way.

But for 5 Accounts it's not that much work with the copy &amp; paste\^\^

an example of what you are talking about might be useful
---
I was actually looking at that last night...contemplated it for the torch...and I haven't done a collection on the PoF maps yet. In fact I hardly go there since I finished the storyline. Not a bad idea. 
---
Ad Infinitum is the best piece in whole game for me, so I just wanted to draw it! But I understand, not all like it and that’s okay.
---
If you use 80 booster you Will have enough for core, but have to farm expansions for elitespecs.
---
So open world DPS varies wildly since you can't guarantee 25 might, quickness, any alacrity, 25 vulnerability on the target, banners, fury, spirits, etc, etc. Some builds can supply some of this on their own but it all comes with some kind of a cost and no build does everything you'd get from organised content. To get to your question though, in general if people are doing over 10k on open world bosses or bounties I consider that good. Sometimes people will get support from others and some builds have pretty massive burst damage but again sustained numbers around 10k+ are "high" DPS IMO. You can always see what you and others in your squad are doing in open world and compare though with Arc, could see how you stack up in that particular fight.
---
got some more of these pixels?
---
note that those population labels are only taking wvw activity into consideration, not e.g. total (active) accounts associated with a world.
---
Very nice points! Maybe i should take the alt for a spin for a time too. 
---
Generally if you run any build that makes any sense you should be fine.  
---
I'd say bring CC if you want to compensate for scaling events. In my experience its the most annoying mechanic when it gets scaled up in open world - its something that in some cases is impossible to be compensated by a few experienced players.
---
I don't like wings in this game either, but it's way too late for them to turn back now. Might as well embrace it like the glowy mount skins. They're not going anywhere.
---
The idea that d/d would be good for aoe when it isn't. Besides, Shadow Flare and Dagger Storm are irrelevant from your choice of weapons, so they're also irrelevant for the point I'm trying to make. 
---
S/P may be a poor filler as well, it's still objectively better for cleave.
---
They have to pay for servers somehow.

while i admit to being quite douchey myself sometimes, i'm working on it..and while some of my comments come off as rude, those are a small percentage

One more relic (18 vs 19), lower karma, and slightly better loot chance at the higher difficulty.

Not our problem. Seriously after the first month if you don't want to be spoilered don't use game's social networks.
---
Wow thanks. I've always hated the outlines.
---
Seems like an open world builds, in which case you can deviate from it in a few places. Runes aren't all that important in open world aside from min-maxing. Just get any other condition rune from the trading post.
---
What would go with that poison based elite? Long bow/shortbow, pistol(s)/rifle or maybe some underwater weapon converted to terrestrial? Or maybe hammer for the luls?
---
Iirc from phantasms, pets and summons, yes.
---
Thanks so much for taking the time on this, very helpful!
---
You can bet there will be one. And as you say it has all the numbers to be an amulet since we already have an accesory and the ring is supposed to be acquired with raids. Probably every season will end up with a legendary trincket. 
---
The interesting question for me is if they are just going to release one with it's specific effect or if they will implement some kind of synergy depending on how many you have equipped.
---
But i also ask myself: What if they also do a dual legendary thing with the greatsword the same as they did with generation 1? That's the reason why i alredy have enough materials ready for a 4 legendary release (if they include coalescence at the same time).
---
Thanks so much. I will try making my own group.
---
It's woth to check which one has the instabilities, you can better manage to handle with.
---
Isn't buying the exotic torch...like...Super expensivo? I have read that somewhere. I'm at work now so can't check pricing.
---
It's probably just my resolution then. I have it at 1600x900 because I'm playing it on my laptop.
---
You would have to START EotN to get to it, and walk to the Eye of the North, where the HoM is. If this is your first time playing GW1, I can tell you right now that the first instance of EotN will not spoil anything you don't already know about the Guild Wars setting. You will also get a handful of Heroes for your trouble, who will make playing through the campaigns in order a lot easier (though if there's renewed interest in GW1 you might have some luck with LFG, the old timers have mostly relied on Heroes instead of the Henchmen you can recruit in towns.) 
---
Assuming you're starting with Prophecies, you will need to reach Lion's Arch before you can start EotN.
---
&gt;Idk, i dont think it is such a "massively high price" you have hundreds or even thousands of gameplay hours in gw1, i cant think one 5$ game on steam that can provide you that much. 
---
It would be fine for a brand new game, but it's definitely not. It is a ten year old game. You don't sell ten year old games for nearly the retail price of a new one. Even GW2 new is FREE right now, and they're charging the cost of Path of Fire for a ten year old game (*more* than the cost of PoF on sale).
---
It's just bonkers. 
---
You can argue "it's a great game" until the moas come home, but there are plenty of "great games" that still sell for $10 regular and $5 on sale. 
---
At this point, if they haven't made their money back on GW1 then they never will, and if they genuinely think it's a good game and want people to play it, they should just make it available to people for free. 
---
From the subject 6 wiki page: "Notably, non-players such as Illusions will not create a stack."
---
It really isn't, unless you're using dpi scaling (it used to make certain things blurry in the past, not sure if that got fixed).
---
Finally found a worse enemy than Vines and Mini Raptors here, the dreaded Chak. Good time.
---
Heart of Thorns will remove core restrictions. But you can get to max level without owning Heart of Thorns as well. In other words, free to play restrictions don't affect what level you can get to.
---
However, you can't play every zone. You can't use mounts. You won't be able to use certain specializations. 
---
Each expansion comes with it's own exclusive content. If you want to play it all, you have to buy it all.  That said, the restrictions from free to play are removed no matter which expansion you buy.
---
When is next Requiem: All or Nothing coming out?
---
Honestly? I'm not trying to excuse the price; I just think that if anyone hasn't played these games yet, and wants to, then they should. 40 euro's like 45 USD, or 63 AUD. Given the choice between paying 90AUD for a 30 hour, bleeding edge graphics card fucker from this year, or 63 AUD for 3 fully fledged, interlinked games and an expansion that you can spend 1000 hours in and still have goals? I'd buy the 14 year old relics.
---
Yeah, it costs more than it did. Yeah, it's a dick move. EU's paying 5 more USD for their trouble; that isn't great. But the games themselves? They're sensational. And they're worth every cent (no matter the exchange rate.)
---
Completely anecdotal, but I get waaaay better results when trying to lead a VB meta when I tag up using my mentor tag instead of my commander tag.  For some reason, people are less likely to zerg behind an apple tag.

That's what she gets for stealing my thunder against Joko and killing my boy Balthazar. Good riddance!
---
&gt;rrently not able to watch the video linked in the original post. It might contain the information I felt was missing.
---
 Its available to anyone who would like to participate, I believe its first come first serve for the 16 and NoctWolfTV will be opening up registration closer to the tournament date. If memory servers me, some of the regulars will be assisting him with the tournament.
---
Either Heart of Thorns, or Path of Fire will unlock all free to play restrictions, such as trading post and sending items through mail or guild bank etc... It will also unlock core tyria masteries, dailies, and the ability to purchase gems for gold and buy items from the gem store. The maximum level for all players is level 80, which is also available in the free to play variant - so no change there.
---
From then on, PoF zones and story give access to mounts, and specializations and 2 raid wings.
---
HoT zones provides its own specializations and access to the glider and the original 4 raid wings.
---
You can buy them in whatever order you like, but you get a discount if you buy them together.
---
They didn't give us a timetable for them, sadly. :( 
---
What you did was not advice, it was simply saying: "This guy charges too much, because i say so."
---
Actual advice would maybe include examples of other similar artists and their prices, and be presented as a tip instead of criticism.
---
And... Don't try to tell me that these dots don't make your reply negatively loaded...
---
Awesome brushwork. I wish they had painted out a bit more of the original screenshot though. It's quite telling what is in game. I hope you didn't get charged too much for this as it appears to be mostly paint over. It's great work, but since the artist didn't need to design much himself and simply do the brushwork and photobashing I hope there was a discount involved. 
---
The Base Game is F2P by deffault. HoT or PoF will remove the restrictions on it (Which are basically all there to protect the regular playerbase from Trolls, Scammers and Bots)
---
For levels: You can go up to Level 80 from 80 compared to the base game and go even further with PoF reaching the mind boggling Level of 80. 
---
Or better put: GW2 does not use a levelgrind for your character to get better. HoT and PoF come both with masteries that level up stuff independent of your characters performance, like the glider, autolooting or the mounts.
---
I just want them to make all the achievements account bound as a recovered alcoholic I was all over the place in gw2. If my achievements were linked I'd easily get good walking among mortals and other such achievements.
---
Oh also bringing over Paragon to gw2 since only a single skill mimics the paragon mechanic in gw2. Plus land spears and class change so I can swap from my current main to the new one.
---
Great reference, have an upvote
---
The game caps out at level 80 and you can reach that with the free core game. After level 80 the game switches to leveling up elite specializations that add more power to your class. And Masteries that add additional benefits account wide, like being able to stealth while gliding or speed boosts in a town.   
---
Buying either expansion removes all free to play restrictions. 
---
Story wise for the full Guild Wars storyline you have to buy the following:

Living World Season 2
---
Heart of Thrones Expansion 
---
Living World Season 3
---
Path Of Fire 
---
Living World Season 4 Episodes 1-4, Episode 5 is currently free.
---
&gt;Easiest and **cheapest** way to get full Viper is to reroll ascended **Berserker** equipment, that **you crafted yourself**, in the Mystic Forge.
---
Note that crafting berserker gear isn’t the cheapest option. For instance, a berserker’s intricate gossamer insignia costs around 6.2g to craft or 6.5g to buy on the trading post, whereas a dire intricate gossamer insignia can be bought on the trading post for 40s. Dropped/salvaged insignias/inscriptions like dire are cheaper than the crafted ones.
---
And crafting grandmaster’s marks is usually cheaper than crafting full gear, but you need the extra currency like fractal relics and research pages.
---
1. I recommend looking on marketplace like fiverr or one specifically for art. I used one for a commission a while ago which was advertised on reddit but can't seem to find. There are a bunch of those marketplaces out there.
---
2. In general the price he/she/they offered is normal but the timespan was too long hence the end price being too high. A lot of artists charge the same but do it faster and deliver higher quality.
---
3. The dots is a typing habbit of mine. Wasn't negatively loaded.
---
thanks

I just want more charr faces with their mouths closed
---
Are you implying it was inappropriate for someone to be talking about Harry Potter in map chat because someone might not have read it yet? Because that's a shade rediculious

PSA: Purchasing from the cash shop has a negative correlation to how much other people enjoy playing with you. This is an effect that DOES NOT show up on the effects monitor, DOES stack when you make additional purchases, and will eventually expire if you stop and just play the game. Gems purchased with in-game gold can contribute to this effect if obtained through non-allowed means; i.e, through a gold seller website.
---
Hell yeah! I've been waiting for this! Now perhaps my damn old rig will run the game in a proper manner.
---
Season 4 will have a episode 6 and then prolly the next expac announcement at the end of that
---
WoC HM, easily... I wish. It's more comfortable with real players imo. With just heroes it's a Nightmare. Even with real palyers it is, but at least they can use all the op PvE skills.
---
FSP lost a lot of players to other servers (due to the screwed up link system we have) long ago and have them self become a link the last two re-links. This period you are linkes with RoS as your host servers. It will change in the end of this month and then you will be linked to another server host. Due to this most links loose their identity and you will have to join the host servers voice tool. 
---
Some llinks try to keep their comunity going but as you can imagine it is not very easy. 
---
If you want to join the host servers ts/discord just ask in the chat when you are in WvW and they will give you the info.
---
RoS should have a lot of comanders to make WvW active but after RoS became the second bandwagon server and them thinking they could take down WSR but didn't even come close they seem to have stopped playing this week. I am sure they are back to normal next week when they no longer play against WSR. Most servers get depressed and don't play when facing WSR.
---
See this is the actual advice that you could have given, instead of whatever your first reply was. Unfortunate that i'm not the one who needed it.
---
I made a mistake and forgot to type "seem" in the last bit, that's on me. But a message *is* negatively loaded if it *seems* negatively loaded, which it did to me and (apparently) a lot of other people. Regardless of wether that was your intention, it's still interpreted as such. So if I were you, I'd probably try to cut down on the dots, to prevent situations like this one
---
istan with trophy shipments.
---
&gt; I've completed the intro to HoT and PoF
---
Assuming (in PoF's case) you mean you've only unlocked the raptor; absolutely. The Raptor, Springer, Skimmer, Jackal and Griffon (and Beetle) are all mounts that do six very specific different things. They aren't like blanket land/flying mounts you find in games like World of Warcraft, the Raptor leaps gaps. The Springer leaps high, the Skimmer makes water your bitch, the Jackal makes traversing heavily-packed areas (with traps, enemies, etc) easier, and the Griffon flies &amp; glides. The beetle is also the best at direct, flat-terrain travel over long distances due to it's extreme speed.
---
I absolutely recommend completing PoF to finish acquiring the mounts, even with their costs.
---
&gt; They don't need to. Just don't let them use old skins.
---
That would never happen, they need them to be able to use the gem store skins at least.
---
They had slippery slope, social awkwardness bumper cars and sugar rush in a rec the other day. Lots of bouncing around the chaos fractal. Was pretty funny tbh
---
Still havent 100% it on any of my characters. I fear the day...
---
I dont know if you meant to be, but you were incredibly rude just now.

I disagree with him, I'd say he should be charging more, that art was jaw dropping. 
---
&gt;With decent doing enough DPS to compensate for your presence that scales the event.
---
For meta-events (Chack Gerent, Octovine, etc) there you may want to take a sort of hybrid build that does a good/decent DPS and buffs other people around you! If you can provide so any of Might, Fury, Quickness, Alacrity, Banners, Spirit or any 5 player buffs (EA, AP mostly) then you are increasing the total DPS of your squad quite nicely even if some of the people are not really doing a rotation. Bringing a completely selfish DPS that gives no boon/buffs to other people but has top DPS is often worse than having slightly less DPS but helping.
---
If you want to immensely compensate the event scaling you brought then those builds may be what you are looking for.
---
If you want a slightly longer explanation of why such builds are very interesting for meta event (and see some of them), I would encourage you to look at the the new, still in progress, series that Nike started about [Overpowered Open-World Builds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sntvQj4q6Y4). Among the builds already out, I think the ones that bring the most to the table are:
---
* [Might-God Condi Tempest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tsDFJbabNTc), 25 might and fury on 10 people while doing very good DPS with a very easy rotation
---
* [Quickbrand Condi Firebrand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trm7ekgD2jU), classic Quickbrand build to provide Fury, Quickness and some Might to 5 people with very good DPS and a slightly harder rotation
---
* [Phalanx Warrior](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR6Keh_6mjE), classic Core Warrior Banner build with PS to bring 2 offensive Banners to 10 people and a nice amount of might to 5 people while doing nice DPS
---
So if you want to carry a meta those are really good builds to pick from.
---
No leaks, he is dreaming.
---
Might not be. I do recall there being gw2 action figures somewhere
---
Exactly! So much of the wonder and mystique of Heart of Thorns lied with the maps themselves, while in Path of Fire it's more about the mounts. Path of Fire maps had (for the most part) very little vertical layers. And yes, some places in PoF are high and some are deep... but it's not the same as Heart of Thorns.
---
Well that's unfortunate. With the way ANet never talks about their future plans, I find any potential leak really exciting.
---
Not to mention that I always preferred Factions over Nightfall, would love to return to Cantha some day...
---
People are sad because the game is telling them to be sad. Though I have to admit the way the devs handled it was the best and perhaps most emotional scene in the entire GW franchise. But in terms of story, I have to agree with you. As a player I had no connection with Aurene whatsoever. I'm with Rytlock on this one. 
---
That's not what runes need, as some of them already do that. 
---
We need stat-less runes that work on a 3 Tiered system so that we can combine 2 sets in our armors. Remove the stats, and have only the bonuses. For instance rune of the Lich would give you Condi Duration, Condi Duration and the current final buff, Condi Damage + summons jagged horror + 10% more hp. Then you could combine with something like rune of mercy for a hybrid scourge build that focuses on some dmg and some heal power through res. Or combine with a more dmg oriented rune for full dps spec. 
---
This would require a severe rework on runes, since most of them are stat-based. For instance rune of renegade, doesn't do anything special, it only adds damage. 
---
It would create for more engaging gameplay and buildcraft. Sure for PvP and WvW that could cause some balance issues but for PvE it would be pretty sweet. 
---
&gt;You are actually getting 4 games for £34.99. £8.75 per game.
---
No, one game with four expansions to it. Again, a fair point if it were a modern game, but it's not, it's ten years old. You can get three Spyros for $40 and they completely redid every model and map in it. Did they rebuild every model and map in GW1 to GW2 quality? No? I didn't think they did. 
---
I could spend 30 hours in each of those, but instead I'm going to play them in Kingdom Hearts III, which released this year. And if not, I could pick up the entire Kingdom Hearts Collection for $40, which includes 1, 2, Chain of Memories, Birth by Sleep, DDD, Fragmentary Passage, and three movies, all fully remastered to at least PS3 standards. 
---
Seriously, ten year old game, with minor tweaks and upgrades since release. Not a $40 package. 
---
Multistep collection for combat tengu tonic. There you go.
---
Those work really well as long as you don't want to mount up.
---
It is viable for fractals (because the burst is still pretty nice) assuming you have the correct gear and rotation but other classes can easily outperform it. It is however nice for meh groups because you have a lot of sustain + self buff if you need to. Talking about T4 runs here, for T1-T3 Reaper will work very well because you won't usually have a lot of buffs from other people.
---
For raid it is also viable but you will also be outshined by many other builds plus the Aura of bosses will reduce your DPS (compared to the golem/fractals for example) because it will reduce the time you can sped in Shroud/make it end lower than expected.
---
It's ok to start fractals and raids with Power Reaper but as a DPS you should try and branch out a bit so that you can play different build depending on the situation.
---
tl;dr: totally viable but other builds will work a lot better, so try to gear other builds as you progress.
---
&gt; So after a while people just don't have any reason to get on to the game, sometimes even for casual players. Maybe just wait for new LS chapters.
---
So basically the same as in the west then. Because given the age of the game, and looking at friend lists, that's how quite a lot over here approach the game nowadays, too.
---
Uh, interesting. I thought it's a complete new pack.
---
They don't need to do any of that. Let Tengu start at lvl 60 in Cantha, give them their own personal Story from 60 to 80 and after that, they can start the Cantha main story. They can't wear armor skins from Tyria (or don't want to lore wise). If Arena Net dedicates a Team of 5 to 10 designers only to work on armor skins for Tengu, they could poop out 20 Sets for the next expansion, following up with new sets in every LW episode after that.
---
Arena Net limits their own developer because everything needs to fit in all other areas of the game. But do we really need to have a new race in 2020/2021 that has to go through the whole Story so far? Most people skip the vanilla story anyways after the first character. And having a "prestige" new race, that starts on a higher level and doesn't have access to every story bit of the past, is still better than never getting a new race at all. Also the account bound trophy system supports that idea. Yes, you could not replay the HoT and PoF Story with your Tengu character. But you can still glide and use mounts once unlocked on your account.
---
Thats it. A new race implemented without redoing 6 to 8 years of content.
---
The title She’s gone is a spoiler, oh i hope our dragon is still alive...
---
PSNA agent buy the thing that gives a map bonus and use the in a map where the reward is what you need 
---
Today I used around 16 ones in mount maelstrom and got 13 T6 totems and a couple of land stones and obsidian shards 
---
You can buy up to six of these each day and sometimes you get lucky and it rewards 10 times the current reward
---
Sorry about the item name I can’t remember it and I don’t really know how the 10 times reward work (but it does and it happened to me before) would appreciate it if a veteran explained how it works

Too soon...😢

&gt; it still sends a message to your players after you have abandoned the game for years

It's the players who abandoned the game, the game was always there...

Only because a game is finished, it doesn't mean it's abandoned. Servers were always there, support was always there, major problems still get fixed, all official and *not* in anyones free time.

The standard answers will be volatile magic and/or farm gold and TP buy.  Assuming that you are willing to be a bit sub-optimal in the name of greater enjoyment and are actually looking for mob farming, here are some guiding principles:
---
1) You want to find foes that drop the t6 mats and do not drop things like eggs, meat, barbed thorns, leaf fossils, as these seem to compete for t6 drop slots in the loot tables.  Loot bags also displace t5 and t6, but they can be more valuable than the t5s so it is a more complex call.
---
1a) If you are after a particular trophy you want to look for a mob that is a "pure" drop for that material.  What does that mean?  Bats and minotaurs drop only blood and no other trophies.  Skelk drop blood and fangs.  Skale drop blood and eggs.  Bats are the "pure" blood farm, skelk would be second best, skale should be your last choice.  Other "pure" drop examples include spiders (venom), fish (scales), branded (dust), warthogs/boars (fangs), and destroyers (claw). 
---
2) Point 1a is balanced by the need to find good mob density/respawn rate.  You should shoot for 600 kills/hr.  There aren't huge concentrations of bats all over the map, but there are skelk camps in various places.  
---
3) With all that said, with 500% Magic Find you're looking at a drop rate of about 6% for t6 mats from a lvl 80 mob that does not drop the undesirable stuff listed in point 1.  So combined with our 600 kills per hour you are looking at an estimated average of 36 t6 mats per hour.  You should also get about 24% of kills giving you a t5, so about 144 of those on average.  You'll get other random gear, a bit of junk and salvage too.
---
If you run quick numbers based on the 600 kill/hr number above, you'll see that if all of those t5 and t6 are totems then you're doing ok at about 19g/hr in materials / 22 g/hr equivalent to farming something else an buying what you need.  But there is no pure totem play.  Bloods ring in at 14 / 16 on the same calculation and the other trophies are less.  Farming in LS3 and LS4 maps will give unbound/volatile magic and karma if you have the buff.  Seems to average 3 volatile magic per kill, so you'd be getting 1800 VM on top of the loot, which is worth another ~7-8 gold converted to shipments.  When added to the direct mob drops, efficient mob farming in LS4 maps is in a decent place value-wise relative to the popular farms.
---
With all that said - Sandswept has a varied population of foes and also gives VM.  Inquest are a decent farm with totem prices where they are.  Mining and consuming difluorite will also help towards more shipments.  Kourna (awakened inquest drop like regular inquest) and Jahai have some spots where you can rack up some kills and VM.  
---
Part of it may also be modifying your playstyle a little based on your goals and info - I always kill bats unless I'm in a hurry.  I happily run past skale.
---
If you want to see the data and drops model that I use to support these assertions there is a writeup of some of my testing over on the [official forums](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/35063/research-drop-rates-of-materials-from-foes-and-influence-of-magic-find)
---
Does the mass of people in the canopy waiting for the matriarch count for scaling down below? As a member of the bunny brigade, “oops, my bad.”
---
How deep does this thing go?
---
Tbf I assumed that in T4 you would have a Spellbreaker Banner when boon were involved but then I haven't actively pugged T4  for a while :p
---
TBH, the GW1 micro-transaction is pretty poorly designed, since it was tacked on at the end of its life. The prices are pretty high tbh too.
---
The Complete Edition being worth $40 isn't too bad in all honesty. It's the individuals being at $20 that seems a bit silly. Though TBH I'd probably do $10 ea + $35 for all four + BMP, and replace the Game of the Year and 2008 Edition upgrades for a singular "all promotional items" DLC.
---
Cantha *does* make sense in a lot of ways. Nothing remotely confirms it, but a lot of minor detail speculation supports it:
---
- Since people are pretty sure we'll get a map in the Blood Legion Homelands for Episode 6, that covers one area we've been very eager to revisit. If that is the case, it's probably very unlikely we'll continue to get maps up there for LS5.
---
- So where else can we go? Somewhere totally new, never before seen in the Guild Wars franchise? Unlikely, because nostalgia is too powerful. Much as it would be great to keep seeing maps in Elona, again, it's unlikely they'll go back for another season.
---
- Assuming we don't kill Kralk in Episode 6, what? Are we going to get a season similar to LS3 that takes us all over the place as he continues rampaging through the Mists? Assuming we do kill Kralk, where do we go next? What's our next objective? Primordus and Jormag are asleep, so what? Would we finally see the Deep Sea Dragon start to cause chaos? If that is the case, wouldn't our best staging ground be an island far into the Unending Ocean?
---
- With the mystery of Lyssa and the other gods, where would we look for answers? We've already scoured most of Orr. Maybe there's a chance we'll explore King Doric's bloodline and the remaining Bloodstones in Tyria? Otherwise, the *oldest* known human nation, where humans are said to have first settled in the world, is Cantha. (Though there are rumors of other lands where Canthans came from, but again, nostalgia is stronger). So if we want ancient human history answers, Cantha might be the place to go.
---
I'm sure someone could come up with plenty of reasons for some other location to be the focus of LS5, but given what context we currently have, I can see why people are pointing toward Cantha with such confidence.
---
Make a "problem" and sell the solution :) ez  
---
Altho I highly doubt this was the case with gw2, they just saw people don't care about immersion too much and only want pretty characters so they had to make new ones and decided to make a buck while they're at it.
---
3 campaigns and 1 expansion, technically.
---
Overpriced, but not "massively" so. Given the quality of the game, I'd probably charge $35 for all 3 campaigns, expansion, and BMP (aka all story content).
---
It's the hairiest mess of ads positioning. Just bring a tanky toon with a lot survivability if you ever decide mapping it or a thief to avoid it all
---
Context dumbass. 
---
I don't really care about Legendaries myself. I just hate the inconsistency. It looks like Totems are tier 7 when compared to everything else (except maybe blood).
---
td is a masterpiece, not just a flat desert that u can autorun through
---
If you were charged more, contact support and see if you can get a refund. If not, contact support and see if you can get a discount on the complete edition if you want it.
---
Oh please, stop acting like a goddamn snowflake.  The "sarcasm over the internet/over text" debate has gone on for almost 40 years now, and it has been universally agreed upon at this point -- MULTIPLE times might I add -- that when socializing over a text-based medium, if you are going to incorporate sarcasm (especially the type that's so subtle, like what you attempted), it's best to leave some sort of simple indicator of it, so as not to run the risk of confusing people.  Over the past few years, "/s" has started to become a universally accepted form of denoting sarcasm in text.  You're no exception just because you think your sense of humor is godlike or something.
---
Are you referring to the Elonian faces now available in the char creator for humans?? 
---
I think you're taking mounts for granted, considering TD is pretty much the worst as designed without mounts
---
Free Core: 80lv, story chapters from core game, living world 1-2. Restricted market, hero slots, acces to some maps after reaching certain lvl (not an issue at all) and no daily rewards. Dungeons, fractals, all equipment tiers, pvp, wvw are freely accessible.
---
Buying any expansion lift up restrictions. Max lvl is 80 no matter what. There are no better loot or tiers or such, just more variations of statistics to choose from.
---
HoT: mastery system (notable: gliding). Maguuma jungle maps, new story, access to guild hall features, ability to craft legendary weapons from zero, 4 raids. One new class: revenant. On top of this each class gets another traitline to choose from and it's called elite specialisation. It changes class a lot. It also gives option to buy living story 3 chapters.
---
PoF: mastery system (notable: mounts), new maps, new story, also gives ability to craft legendary weapons precursors like HoT, no new classes but another set of elite specializations for every class. Also gives option to buy Living Story 4 (if you didn't unlocked them yet for free).
---
[hahaha](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKfnMDmG70o)
---
i really hope so, it would be even better if they ship them separately or at groups of 2\3, to keep the game fresh and give us time to digest them instead of getting a whole set in a time making the whole playerbase confused for months.
---
I hated it when HoT came out, and it was partially responsible for making me take an extended break from the game. But then once PoF was announced, I decided to start playing again and wanted to finish all the masteries and such I'd glazed over and ignored.
---
Coming back and really giving it some time made me love this map. It can be infuriating, but really rewarding once you learn the routes and how everything is laid out. Mounts make it even more fun.
---
I also do the meta every night just after reset, and I love every bit of it.
---

You know the exponential part is about the cost, right?
---
Why do you think the [+18 agony infusion](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/item/49441-18-Agony-Infusion) is almost 5000 gold?
---
yeah, Anet then :) 
---
It was a wall of text, but a welcome one
---
I'm so ready with all 9 classes atm, i mean, since i don't have much to do ingame at the moment, i completed all maps with one character per class, so i'm drowning in hero points with them.
---
Also, after HoT i created tons of alts to make them "elite spec dedicated toons", and i did the same with pof, so i have tons of characters with core class and ONE elite spec fully unlocked, and a whole 654 avaiable hero points to spend instead of 404 you have with everything unlocked, so i can just grab the easiest 250 and go for the next spec.
---
also, doing wvw, i got so much "spare" ability points [i always get that currency with chests] that i could create new toons and insta unlock new stuff
---
Yeah, you’d think that’d be the case with necromancers...
---
Clockwork City is still by far my favorite ESO story dlc. I enjoyed every single bit of it and I'm so glad we could see and speak to Sotha Sil while he was still alive and well, before he was murdered by Almalexia :) 
---
&gt;and only have one of each every fractal.
---
One of each fractal. Each with a CM and you only get CM rewards when that fractal is a daily.
---
&gt; \- It won't be melee dps (we already have reaper)   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; So the only thing left is shield and sword. Maybe a tanky Death Knight kinda spec? 
---
how do those two statements add up now?
---
stating it'll not be meele and then coming to the conclusion to talk about a meele spec?

You can buy all of them in a Steam bundle for less than the collector's edition. You miss out on the skins, pets etc though. Plus as far as I can see, there is no actual new content in the CE. If you have never played GW and really enjoy collecting in-game pets, outfits, wep skins etc its not a bad deal tbh.
---
Let's think.
---
Necro core shroud system make it by default a tank. Survivability is high, dmg is low no matter what.
---
Reaper lack purpose. It meant to be power dps, was stuck as average condi dps for years (and only if playing solo). Now after years they are trying to finally make it power meele, yet it still sux.
---
Scourge was meant to be support but it started as condi dps. Then it was quickly gutted from all dps. And it is a support with no supportive abilities (compared to three support gods: ranger, warrior, chrono).
---
Since we have "power dps melee" and "support" then now it's time for ranged condi. Let's call it Afflictor.
---
I wouldn't say the rewards are underwhelming, they're just things that people grow out of.  Getting night to T4 rewards you with a selectable piece of exotic armour.  Even ignoring the unique skins, there's not a lot of repeatable content in the game that gives you an exotic piece of equipment with your choice of slot and stats each time you succeed.
---
But of course, experienced players already have exotic gear, and probably even Ascended gear.  The playerbase has outgrown it, but it's still a unique reward setup.  Neither Tarir nor Chak Gerent give guaranteed exotics out, let alone selectable guaranteed exotics.
---
Still waiting for rosebud-like hairstyle for both female and male Sylvari..

That shackling wave in the beginning hurts to look at when I rewatch it. I think I should have not used that fight but I thought it was a nice way to open the video going into an enemy camp and such. Deep down I know I suck but I think I am slowly improving. I really appreciate you giving the video a try. I think I put some of the few good fights in weird spots of the video and that is my mistake to learn from.
---
I have a few kits to use if they add more stuff :D
---
Considering I did most of my map completion for legendaries before the introduction of mounts, no, I'm not. I honestly think Tangled Depths is one of the best maps this game has ever seen. Sure it is complex, but it has (excuse the reference) so much more depth than any other map in this game.
---
When I was playing it more frequently during HoT, I'd love the feeling of not quite being sure what was around the corner or having to backtrack later due to masteries. It honestly gave me that feeling of exploration and discovery that I thought I was having during my first time roaming Ashenvale in early WoW (before you realise the assets and caves are all recycled to the extent and the portals don't lead to the Emerald Dream).
---
With mounts the map completion is definitely quicker and easier and that feeling of exploration and achievement when you got the Chak Driver HP or did the Skelk mastery point or stumbled on the disco area is lacking. If anything, I think mounts remove some of the magic of HoT maps where you were rewarded for actually learning routes and paths.
---
Maybe I'm just odd but since GW2 has absolutely no vertical progression on your main character once you get your ascended gear (so over 3 and a half years for me now) or elite spec (last one was almost a year and a half ago) I think maps should be tougher to give some sense of at least horizontal progression. We don't even get that in PoF past the griffon quest sadly so I appreciate Tangled Depths as an odd anomaly that didn't cater to making everything simple and straightforward. Having one map like that in a game that has over 24 maps designed for level 80 characters (and double that over all) isn't a bad thing. 
---
Minis, nodes, mats, ascended gear. It’s not completely useless.
---
Of course, they should also make the orange tabby cat and any other cat you get as a mini appear in the home instance after unlocking it.

This is disheartening since I just started on the Wayfarer's Henge, thought it would be a neat back item to fit in with a druid build/theme I'm working on.  
---
Oh well, guess I'll just chip away at it.  I thought about getting Aurora but if you can't turn off those stupid balls it really doesn't interest me at all.
---
The second one sounds badass. T1000 got sent back too far.
---
That was the idea. It's based on a black lion trader.
---
There's your level 80 vanilla, then each of two elite specs. Which ones you relate to and enjoy depends on you. Boosting to 80 still leaves a lot of learning and growing for each one.
---
I have 8 maxed toons with both specs unlocked and working on my ninth. I've found that setting goals for each toon separately helps drive the playtime I need to engage with them - different crafting professions for each, assigning specific collections for each, doing each elite weapon collection, maybe parking each one in a different map to run metas, bounties, etc.  
---
I don't play Charr or Asura because they're ugly as fuck, and that's all there is to it. Even the cutest possible Asura is still uglier than even an average looking Sylvari. And there is no such thing as a cute Charr. Is that shallow? Yes, but I have to care about the character and look at them to play them. It's never going to happen with a Charr and most likely never going to happen with an Asuran.
---
I think it's the best map of the HoT maps.  The map is well designed, it's intricate without being overly confusing (ahem Tangled Depths), the meta is fairly challenging and well paced, there's always things to do.  It's fun to explore and not too tedious to complete (i.e. doesn't have 3000 POI and you don't NEED the meta to finish it).
---
I would love if they could at least make the hairstyle no longer locked between races. Or adding a short hair on hat/helm works too.
---
and i find magical looking, over the top characters much better than poor pedestrians with their boring looks!!!
---
Laurel vendor
---
Is it as convenient as a necro? I can use Corrupt Boon which has 2 charges and a 20 second cooldown, plus as a power reaper I have axe 3, greatsword 4 and even Well of Corruption and focus if I really need it. 
---
Scourge has its own boonstrip but I'm not as familiar with it.
---
You’re intended to be able to access the canopy even during the day. Why would they lock half the map to the day night cycle. There are quite a few spots where you can access the canopies at any time without chopers. The chopers are merely for convenience
---
Well considering that charr horns and ears are largely ignored along with no tail flaps and armor stretching, so what would be any different with tengu? 
---
&gt; AP you get from this living story 
---
So when it's convenient for you, you try to shift the focus of the conversation to the LS as a whole when all along we've been talking about Dragonsblood Weapons.   
---
&gt;look at how much AP was handed out like free candy in LS1
---
The Tower of Nightmares from LWS1 awarded 76 AP if you completed all the achievements.  The Nightmares Within awarded 68 AP.  In comparasion, All or Nothing has 353 AP available.  You can get more AP from doing half of AoN than 2 chapters of LWS1!   
---
&gt; unfair about asking that all collections, not just this one, should reward an achievement,
---
Completing the collection gives an ample, nay generous AP reward.   You get 108 AP.  No other weapon collection ever in the game has rewarded this much.  No matter how many times you circle back to this with a different approach, it's a fact that ANET has really stepped up the AP reward available. 
---
Your deserve an A for effort for trying to argue your point, but no amount of arguing can make it a *valid* point. 
---
this is really helpful man, thanks.
---
I would assume you would sell them on the trading Post. Then buy the T6 mats with the gold.
---
Its over isn't it, isn't it, isn't it over?
---
Run the Living world Season 4 maps for Volatile magic. Every 250 volatile magic and 1 gold gets you a Trophy shipment full of Tier 5 and 6 mats worth more than 1 gold.  https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trophy_Shipment 
---
The Map Meta events give the most Volatile magic. Istan is particularly good.
---
You can also gather the map currency on each living world season 4 map and consume it for volatile magic. 
---
Hi, thanks a lot. May as well save grinding out those ones for ascended gear too this way!
---
This is where I tended to fight during the Battle of Lion's Arch.  Not as many players went there as to the other, more accessible places, so it gave me a chance to save some citizens that often went unsaved.
---
It's for me the best of the HoT maps once you reach full masteries. It's like a huge jumping puzzle, and most importantly, unlike the rest of the HoT maps, it doesn't forces the player to be in metas to complete all PoIs, which is why I think people who say AB, TD and DS are masterpieces are very wrong.
---
Also got the plmakhan glowy horns and the other one for males
---
These were the pics I took as a sample.

---
A couple months ago I got the backpiece. It wasn't hard finding a group for the lesser bosses, I would just pop a mentor tag. For the wyverns I usually found people doing it around reset.
---
No kidding. Definitely a fun for trolling but not really useful in a fight if you don't land that initial hit lol. I am still tempted to roll a norn ranger just for the elite though... 
---
Someone commented in another thread that they traced their routing thingy and they were being routes through the EU servers before being routed back into the NA servers, they live in NA
---
The horns aren't available, the only way you could get them was with a glitch.
---
["No such thing as a cute Charr," Asura are "ugly as fuck."](https://media.giphy.com/media/26BRrSvJUa0crqw4E/giphy.gif)
---
And that ramp up time also does not fall off anywhere near as severely as power builds. 
---
&gt;When you leave to do a mechanic you are not only missing out on some direct damage then but soft-resetting your initial ramp up that you had at the start of the fight, where as a power class can get right back to where they were. 
---
Other way around. Since you have *conditions* on the boss, while you will lose DPS by doing mechanic, you will lose much less than a power class will. 
---
I wish I knew off the top of my head for you, but al I know was it was Ben saying something like that on Reddit.  It might have been one of the AMAs, but I just remember reading it and feeling encouraged that there might be at least 2 wings per year.
---
No love for that epic boar balloon glider? (And loads for a pair of bloody wings?... Oh bloody wings would be cool...)
---
To get my Henge stuff I'd put up my commander tag 5 minutes before the event, then scream in map chat and announce the mechanics to everyone. I'd also ping whatever guildies were online.
---
It's doable with around 5 people because the fight scales.
---
When I went back to DM for Aurora collection, I did The wyverns on the day that they were the daily.  It seemed to encourage more participation from the map population than when I had tried (and failed) a few days prior.
---
^^^
---
*Karka are the key to all of this.*
---
No but the damage drop off lasts for much longer, as it takes longer to ramp back up in the first place!
---
Facial hair would be nice for a change, specially for asura.
---
Also, enable for everyone the China-only hairstyles!
---
I can appreciate that, as a first encounter it is challenging and fun to explore, one of the very few games like that. Unfortunately the game is built around the premise of repeating content quickly, and that adventure and joy sour into "gimme my amalgamated gemstones".
---
So yea I definitely appreciate your viewpoint, but long-term the mounts are what make me tolerate the zone.
---
Charr would instantly become my main race if this happens
---
Goodbye, forced plot device, now we can focus on the group again.
---
Anyone got Zojja’s ward number? I’m bringing her back to the field.
---
https://immortius.net.au/wardrobe-unlock-analyser/
---
This site is great for seeing what you still need to unlock and the method of acquisition. As for best time to use them it's after getting all the things that are relatively easy to get, things you wouldn't want to waste a GWU on. Like crafted skins, karma skins, or stuff under X amount of gold. 
---
No worries mate!
---
Like I said, I would just like a source, so if anyone ever comes across this comment and have a source please let me know.
---
I don't even doubt Anet. I know they want more wings/year because they have said so and I'm sure sooner or later they will do it. But that was around the start of the season so I would really like to see newer news on the topic! :)
---
They need am in-game way to change hairstyles and body features. It's lame that you have to pay for it.
---
If it's worth anything, I actually really enjoyed doing the Wayfarer's Henge collection. I did it the earliest I could when it came out, and did it without a guide (I find collections a lot more fun that way, since GW2 is a lot about adventure and exploration), and it was a great experience in my opinion! 
---
Maybe you are playing in non-prime time for the server? I know for a fact that 1-2 hours after reset until at least 1-3 hours after, specially Fridays-Sundays, there are lots of people on those areas, just look at LFG. I finished my Aurora a long time ago however I like the verticality of the map so every other week I go there and do a run of it (and bloodstone, my absolute fav LS map) and I barely ever have issues finding people for the meta. If there arent any groups, make a LFG **BEFORE** it begins, and you will see bunch of players flock to you from other servers and the very same map!
---
You already paid for the old gem store skins though.
---
Also, aside from less work, no updates to old outfits means you're more likely to buy new ones instead of using the ones you already have.
---
Draconis Mons is an excellent map, but not really worth being in once you've completed everything there. Notwithstanding, I managed to do one of the legendaries on NA when I was there for fun (I tagged up and recruited people via LFG).
---
I have mixed feelings about the map. Before starting Aurora I hated it. The architecture is messed up. It's oppressive as hell. The fauna is aggressive. The colors are too orangey for me. After a while, I had to come back to complete achievements and I honestly started to enjoy it. After spending some time I really liked it. For a while. Wayfarer's Henge ruined it all over again. Now whenever I go there (to help a guildmate most of the time) I leave as soon as it's over while feeling a bit of nostalgy about it.
---
This! Or some nice full beards that are between the stubble and regular bear options we have now.
---
&gt; All the weapon collections are easy, including Dragonsblood
---
the asc dragonsblood weapons cost ~50g to craft
---
&gt; So when it's convenient for you, you try to shift the focus of the conversation to the LS as a whole when all along we've been talking about Dragonsblood Weapons. 
---
because you keep missing the point.  you keep saying that offering an achievement for the very expensive task of making all asc dragonsblood weapons is an egregious crime of infinite ingratitude to anet as though somehow offering more AP for a very expensive collection somehow HURTS the game/company??? what do they lose from offering more achievements? 
---
&gt; Completing the collection gives an ample, nay generous AP reward.
---
again, completing the *ascended* dragonsblood weapons (as well as other living story weapon collections) offers zero AP, and there is literally no reason not to offer something for finishing that collection.  offering more AP is never a bad thing.  anet doesn't lose anything by granting a few more AP to incentive players to complete tasks.  this is the point you keep missing.
---
Use the defensive potion you get from doing recs for a start.
---
They are just not fun to kill and don't reward you with anything. Besides these bosses I actually still like the map.
---
[removed]
---
I hope they don't, I see enough people trying to make cute looking Charr and I hate it.
---
I have one and its definitely worth it for this game. 
---
[Fractal potions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_Potion) help, though generally the large potions are saved for T4s or the more difficult T3s. 
---
I highly recommend doing Daily Recommended Fractals to get free large pots.  While it's better to hoard them for T4s in the future, don't feel embarrassed to use them, esp for the more difficult fractal like Siren Reef. The Mobility potion is my favourite.
---
I am so confused. Can I have some more information about your experience on ele? Like give me some background. How did you climb to t4? Why don't you have defence pot when it's like 15 relic? etc etc?????? I am so confused. 
---
Because the game doesn't sell often enough to justify the lower price. You can't just lower the price on something. $40 for what is essentially 3 games + 1 XP + bonus digital content isn't bad at all. The Merc stuff is convenience, not content, features, or even necessary so that being sold separately is fine. The storage slots are all (mostly) new so making them pay for everyone is fine.   
---
Additionally, any work that went into these changes (and the new Complete collection) require work from devs, marketing, and sales/product all taking time from those depts working on GW2 or any other projects. So the time factor comes into play. It's a "justifying the work" kind of thing. For this level of work to be done on a legacy product, taking time away from current or new products, requires some sort of ROI. 
---
I main Chrono but staff Weaver is my PDPS option. Honestly, your Druid should be keeping you alive. In general you should be dodging the "big mechanics" and the normal incoming DPS should be mitigated or healed. I don't want to say "blame the Druid" but for the most part you should be focusing on rotations. Also remember that full dead DPS is zero, so it's better to break rotations to keep you out of down state.
---
It really does come down to mechanics though. For example, as a Weaver I would stand there and tank the boss of Chaos, but move out of range of the add knockback missiles. Whereas the boss of Twilight Oasis requires a lot of repositioning. Oddly enough, CM Arkk (boss of Shattered Observatory) requires very little movement aside from bombs. 
---
Why people cry over Guild Wars 3? I don't want another game, this one is cool and I am sad that they don't have many resources to make all of the players dream come true. Do you think such situation is easy to make another game? Creating game has its costs. 
---
That's how a market funktions. In my opinion all materials are way too cheap.
---
definitely
---
So I can finally do my Dumbledore cosplay.
---
The reason might be that they actually are huge. Just like norn.
---
Fix: Just don't make maximum sized characters. You can buy a makeover kit and fix that yourself.
---
My only complaint is that many UI elements are fixed to the edge of the screen. On a 21:9 setup, that means things like your minimap and chat are outside your usual field of view. In games like WoW, you can simply move elements back into the central area of the screen, but GW2 doesn't have any way to do that or inset UI, as far as I can tell.
---
It usually doesn't matter much, but it does mean you need to get accustomed to keeping an eye on chat, because you probably won't see new messages in your peripheral vision... or at least not as easily as usual.
---
&gt; Most likely not shortbow/longbow/rifle/pistols - they don't make sense and there's plenty other classes with that. 
---
I'm sorry but a rifle/pistol ghosthunter with gadgets sounds way too cool to not be implemented as an elite spec at some point.
---
How can I change my appearance? I'm new player around lvl 20 and I dont like how my character looks. I know theres an item in shop for real money, any other way?
---
So they hire out of house for these? Seems dumb IMO.
---
What GPU aer you using?
---
I knew someone would ask .... Gtx 780 😪
---
More than likely we will see a Eye of the North region like xpac before Cantha.
---
To this, and any other objective a player is trying to complete, POST AN LFG! It's what the feature is designed for!! If no one knows you want help, then how can they possibly BE of help?
---
I don't know how many times I have been sitting in my home instance contemplating what to do, then opening up LFG and just choosing something that interests me and jumping in.
---
I see all the time people complaining about no one being interested in lending a hand, but for the most part, every time I post a LFG request, folks step up and help out.
---
It's also worth it because it's one of the best games of all time
---
It has defensive options, but besides that one defensive utility (twist of fate, arcane shield or stone resonance) you're far better with just going down and revive from downed 5 than using earth/water skills in most situations.
---
FA tempest has a lot better passive defense through protection, better range and stability as well as F3 reset so swapping for defensive skills isnt very crucial since you're barely losing anything. Doing the same on weaver weapon skills is a huge dps loss unless the boss is phasing.
---
Someone answered your question. Another thing you may or may not know is that a single hero point in any expansion map gives 10 hero points. 
---
My wife has one and I was playing around with it today swapping between my 27” and her 29”. 
---
Its definately personal preference, extra horizontal fov doesnt really mean much in gw2 and interms of immersion I felt is more or less the same since you your vision is less encompassed on the vertical axis. 
---
Its insanely amazing if you also use the computer for productivity though. 
---
It's 3 games + an expansion, no sub fee, and provides potentially hundreds if not thousands of hours of entertainment. I'd call that a good value. 
---
You cant really take less damage, you either take 80% of your hp bar or you take no damage. While positioning certainly helps a lot, you still rely heavily on healer (if that damage is hard to avoid) or bursting the boss very fast (which most groups arent capable of doing).
---
Random pug play is bad for weavers unless you are good. Learn your evade skills on sword/dagger plus how to put down a water field and how to blast it.
---
please read again what i wrote. bc u clearly did not respond to what i wrote. i'm fine, thats only a tiny % of players there who get this stuff, from my understanding these aren't daily tournaments, right?
---
Why are hot dogs sold in packs of 8 when buns are sold in packs of 6?
---
The Wayfarer Henge
---
Yes, the usage of ad infinitum here is on point.
---
I'd say it's biggest flaw is it doesn't have a clear path to go once you enter the map. It's shown once you do the story, but even then it can be confusing.
---
Don't humans have a couple of kickass beards? One long and raggedy and another that's better kept, saw em today on the black lion appearance npc and heavily considered buying a makeover kit 
---
But i meant body, face, hair etc. Thanks for this advice anyway
---
and said forum criers complain anet never listens to them, i think the different opinion is caused by the fact anet can't listen to every forum crier
---
My Sylvari needs a Ceasar Salad hairstyle and a Trahearne tier face. ;v
---
Yes but it’s quite easy to do 
---
Please yes :(
---
And more horn styles with ornaments for Charr, with earrings on the ears as well!!
---
That is absolutely fine! I think mounts are excellent and they definitely help, for me personally, with how barren Path of Fire maps can feel. It's just a different use of one of the better implemented features in Guild Wars 2 so I can totally see your viewpoint too! 
---
I use a 34" ultrawide (3440x1440) and it is amazing with GW2. Everything scales perfectly, and given the visual nature of the game you get that much more screen real estate to take it all in. For WvW in particular I find it to be pretty advantageous too, just being able to see and such a higher fov. 
---
21:9 gaming in general is amazing and I can't see myself every going back to 16:9. 
---
That being said you will want a decent GPU to push any resolution greater than 1080p. 
---
Plain and simple - best farm being istan.
---
Statistics don't lie though. 
---
Just because something isn't the best doesn't mean it can't be used, you make good points about why Druid is meta but /u/Elles93 was only making a suggestion and not really arguing that heal ele has any place in meta. On the other hand, it also seems weird that they suggested a heal role when this post is clearly about improving in a squishy DPS role.
---
Occasionally you'll get a free makeover kit through stuff like black lion chests, which you can earn a key through the story once a week. But for the most part, they are gemstore related
---
I basically work the character, get XP from hearts, killing mobs and world completion until like level 30, while doing PS
---
I don't remember very much, but either at 30 or 40 I knew if I liked profession or not and then just boosted with tome to 80.
---
For good armor I used the karma merchant from WvW. also for weapons
---
I was about to say just any non-projectile CC, but I totally forgot it's an evade now!
---
I guess you just have to wait it out. It may seem strong, but Warriors can just pop a stance, be invulnerable for power damage, and still have all their skills (and mobility) available when doing so. 
---
Definitly doable when you tag up for yourself. Just don't expect to kill both in one turn. Most people forget to use cc here, making the fights really annoying due to constantly loosing space to stand on.
---
&gt; Their whole statement doesn't even mention if it is online, physical or both....the hell is wrong with you?
---
It's called background information or "knowing the topic". The whole article from Anet was about the online (or digital, because you like that word more) version. Why would anyone mention the physical version out of nowhere?
---
&gt;Oh, and the comment of yours, I responded to, didn't mention shit...
---
Yeah Mr. ghetto boi, you may watch your tongue. I'm not interested in a conversation full of insultings. If you can't, just leave me alone, thanks.
---
I love it. 3440 x 1440

Why do I cry every night?
---
Nooooo, not more +1s. I get your point, but it clutters my storage with all those stacks of +1 infusions. 
---
Eh... you missed the topic...
---
There's no reason to buy anything specifically for a game that's on maintenance mode.
---
Question. In what context?
---
The context when looking at the subreddit is "She's gone" and "Guild Wars 2". Where in that even suggests Aurene and only Aurene?
---
And even them, what prevents this from being a reference to the visions of Episode 4 and not the finale of Episode 5? Without knowing either, ypu cannot fathom this end without imagining a dozen other possibilities.
---
Oh, is it possible to pay you in the EU?
---
If so, I'm definitely interested. Will send a PM. :)
---
Bring back soloq and teamq then, but its not the solo players who will "cry" on forums, it will be the people who team q beacuse there are more solo players then team players, have fun in your long queues and unbalanced matches.
---
Overwatch got built in voicecoms, guildwars 2 dont. So someone who plays together in guildwars 2 have the advantage of voicecoms which random players dont.
---
Overwatch got way more players playing pvp then guildwars 2 will ever have so the matchmaking will be fairer in overwatch.
---
&gt; you keep saying that offering an achievement for the very expensive task of making all asc dragonsblood weapons is an egregious crime of infinite ingratitude to anet as though somehow offering more AP for a very expensive collection somehow HURTS the game/company???
---
You're looney.  My point is, and has consistently been, that 108 is a large and unprecedented amount of AP tied to a single collection.
---
&gt; completing the ascended dragonsblood weapons (as well as other living story weapon collections) offers zero AP
---
108 worth of "zero AP".  No matter how many times or different ways you claim otherwise, you can't complete the collection without getting 108 AP in the process.  
---
Hmm, I don't think so. Even the physical version wasn't that much cheaper before.
---
It's the "everyone and everything's fault but my own" crowd.  ANet came out and said that premade teams lose more than thet win against non-teams. But we have to slay the boogeyman!
---
Tangled depths is the the only jungle map in a mom that made me feel like I was truly in a jungle. While other games would just give me some nicely paved road without any sense of danger around the corner along with invisible walls, Tangled depths instead makes you actually feel like your in a jungle and I love every single second of it. Personally for me, since I was slow with unlocking nuhoch poison mastery there was always a new place to explore. Especially the last layer of the map.
---
fashion wars is 100% why I went from Sylvari (refused to use anything other than leafy armor made for very stale fashion since anet never released more cultural - a damn fucking shame) to Asura (because their animations/voices are really cool to me) to Humans because I got bored of so little variety for asura.
---
A standalone expansion is still an expansion. Same engine, same gameplay, same core skills, same PvP, etc.
---
So watched the 'intro' thing to his vids. I'm certainly checking be reading through that.
---
At this point I'm surprised about all the OW stuff. The game's community looked completly Raids/PvP/WvW with a hint of Fractals to me. So I'm kinda super relieved to see some serious OW oriented stuff.
---
I'm still not sure where to place everything yet. But this is something to dive into, finally have some direction that isn't related/based on/compared to raids/pvp/wvw/ect.
---
Although I doubt I'll ever get there since I'm pretty bad at the game (and don't main). &gt;.&lt;'
---
Thanks for the help o/
---
I do hope the devs do that, maybe material storage from +2 to +(whichever). For now, I personally just upgrade/convert them to +9 so if i do make a character, I can immediately those infusion straight to 150 AR. 
---
Can even try for a +16 if you have a lot of those extra infusions for more gooooolds (people do buy/sell them).
---
I second this motion.
---
and there lies the p2w argument. you can just buy that +20 POWER infusion off their ig store.
---
He wants to play Weaver in random pugs. /shrug
---
For some reason I REALLY miss the missions in the first game. They were all so fun and progressed the story well. It's a real shame that GW2 doesn't have them. The closest we had was Dungeons and we all know how that went...
---
This is just weird, the price is way too high.
---
Anyone interested probably would have bought in a steam sale by now.
---
Sell it or upgrade it. 
---
White people problems 
---
You can't die if you self yourself :) 
---
Anyone knows if Stability can allow group to eat that wind blow without falling into pond from Siren Reef final boss?
---
You get a makeover kit at 80, and its almost a 50% chance from lions  boxes, where you get keys from map completion and personal story, I think its fine
---
Kind of looks like Tybalt's face.
---
GW2Hook doesn’t affect GUI elements by default, but ReShade does. 
---
It makes Maguuma Wastes Lumberer easier if it counts for anything.
---
That's exactly how all of the legendary quests work, in case you were ever thinking of doing a weapon.
---
&gt;•A great part of players came from Gw1, where you could only play as human. 
---
I know this was a deciding factor for me. I didn't want to recreate my character from guild wars 1, but my main was a male human elementalist in the original, and I knew I wanted the same for guild wars 2 before launch. That was what put it over other races that I found unique and was excited to play as, such as Sylvari.
---
Of course, fast forward to present and now that I have multiple characters for certain classes that I enjoy I finally have an equal number of all five races. But still, in order I created them human was definitely the first race I had three of and set myself a limit of okay, that's one of each backstory option at character creation, better work on getting to that point on the others now.
---
Playing Weaver in regular T4 pug groups is suicidal.  The damage instabilities in GW2 are nastier than they've ever been and the amount of ambient damage from instabilities like frailty, adrenaline rush, outflanked and boon-overload is obscene.  I really wouldn't recommend playing it anywhere you have to worry about extreme volatility from adds.  There are a few trait and utility swaps that other people have detailed that you can take advantage of, but I'd rather just play something that doesn't get hard cucked. 
---
Right, I called out instabs specifically with regards to the idea of "supplemental healing" and I agree that it's more important than it was in the past. But you still need to actively mitigate bigger sources of damage, you cannot simply ignore all mechanics just because you have a healer.
---
I’m not saying there won’t be a 2nd accessory I’m just thinking we’ll get an amulet before we get a 2nd accessory. That way we’ll have one of each trinket
---
It means a lot in PvP and WvW. I love being able see all of the paths leading to the point I’m defending. 
---
Humans have a couple of good ones, but Norn should blow humans out of the park, and they kind of don't, which is a damned shame.
---
You do realize there’s a FoV slider, right?
---
There is a gigantic leap between "most characters are human female" and "most people don't play asura or charr because they think those races look ugly".  Please tell me you understand that the former is a factual statement and the latter is a hypothesis with no data.
---
Even saying "human female is the most popular because it has the most fashion choices without clipping or other issues" is still only an assumption, not statistics.  It's a significantly more well-founded assumption, and probably correct, but the existing statistics can't be used to prove it.
---
Troll.
---
*Ahem*
---
How would one go about reproducing this glitch? You know, for bug reporting purposes.
---
You only need to do the bosses once since you can have both the hence and mastery collections active.
---
I just hope whatever it is has a cool collection spanning all season maps. I had fun doing Aurora's though I don't actually use the thing. :P
---
Finding the underwater depths that go under the map and the dark winding caves was a trip
---
So many small caves and places just in Lion's Arch that look amazing.
---
I finished mine not long ago.  I had the best luck going in around reset and there was often someone trying to setup for the meta.  But I do recall distinctly I did like the half the meta pres left the map to go do another map real quick, came back and it was still where I left it.  Definitely a few days I waited a couple hours.  
---
The new map being still new it has probably siphoned players away from all the older maps again for now (especially around reset with the meta timers).  They will slowly kind of funnel back in time.
---
Farming the rune stones over and over again was a bit of a pain.  I started out enjoying the collection.  But by the last tier I didn't want to see those hearts ever again (and I still need to grab the minis and stuff one day when I have enough karma).
---
Depends on who you ask, I personally find a high refresh rate much more important than bigger resolution. GW2 doesn't run well enough to guarantee 100+ FPS in group content though, so if you're dead set on GW2 only, then perhaps a 120+hz monitor isn't ideal.  
---
For overall gaming I would say a higher refresh rate feels better than a higher res.
---
The suggestion is concerning the streamlining of the vendor to accommodate all of the possible rewards from boxes; I acknowledged the alternative of crafting them in the OP.
---
Why not sell them? 
---
I mean but really, what would it hurt to have it easily available at all times?
---
You do realize it's pathetic, right? It doesn't take into account UWHD resolution, so all you can do is alter it *slightly*.
---
I'm often quite critical of Anet's monetization choices but I'm ok with the availability of transmutation charges and makeover kits. It's extremely easy to get transmutation charges, and while there's no reliable way to get makeover kits I have gotten a few through daily rewards and BLCs opened with random keys. Speaking of things in the gem store I wish were not, though, let's discuss that instant-80 boost that bypasses playing the game entirely...
---
Yeah, I bought the US edition for my now ex-girlfriend and it was around 30, 35 bucks.  The box did look different as well.
---
Variable size teams matching with full size teams in ranked game modes just does not work properly unless you have a huge playerbase. 
---
I've seen many games trying it, and they often end up going back to have SoloQ and TeamQ separately since they don't have enough palyers to do things like what LoL did, and variable size teams are only left for non-ranking modes like hotjoin and quickmatch. 
---
For teams we have tournaments. Maybe there should be smaller training-tournaments with lower rewards and no qualifying points  between official tournaments, but there's not enough regular team players for a team ranked leaderboard, and teams of any size matched against solo players will always be unfair in competitive modes. 
---
So, as you said, it can only be SoloQ and FullTeamQ separately. 
---
Leave queens dale and go to caledon forest for the puzzles and mini dungeons. You have every starting area waypoint unlocked. Also if u want to ask any questions or have me guide u thru jumping puzzles just ask if ur on na
---
At reset on NA I often see commanders doing various bosses for the collection. Often times you have to choose to do either Aestus or Ignis because you can pretty much never do both in the same meta.
---
You play too much.
---
It would be lovely if the game catered to you (more free storage for all of us!) but let's not act like this is a common issue.
---
This would be nice if they also removed the balding feature from the wizard hat
---
Then you are living in the wrong country. Here in Germany you can buy 8 buns and 8 hot dogs but also 6.
---
Having those infusions in our version would be nice, for variety's sake, but you'd need to be crazy to buy any above +10.
---
Mate, these are the terms used in the game itself. People have a responsibility to use the right term if they wanna be understood. It's like people coming from another MMO and asking which 'job' they should level. In some games, that means a character profession, in others it means a crafting discipline. Clarity of communication is important, and it becomes obscured if you use casual or unofficial terms for things that have an actual name.
---
You don't think €40 is steep for something you could buy for €35 *10 years ago* including a physical box?
---
Most of the stuff in the GW2 store is cosmetic or quality of life stuff.
---
The GW1 store has skill unlocks and mercenary slots. Inventory space is far more restrictive there too, and will impact your gameplay negatively, forcing you to get mules or sell stuff away all the time.
---
&gt;Then you are living in the wrong country.
---
Ah, it's just an age old joke tbh, but in Canada we have hot dog packs and buns in probably 5 different pack sizes each. I imagine hot dogs come in 6, 8, 10, 12 and 20 or something and buns in like 4, 6, 8, 12. That said, I never eat hot dogs, so what do I know?
---
You can solo the bosses with some cheese builds. Pistol/pistol invigorating precision thief would do it. Condi reaper is probably easy as well
---
The solution to that is put built in voicecoms in GW2. Everyones a winner
---
What about the mounts? Do i have my mounts or do i have to farm those again too with quests and stuff?
---
Yeah that’s the same conclusion I was going with. I’m sure I’m later revisions there will be some built in crosstalk or work around.
---
Then upgrade them to +9s and sell them. 
---
But wouldn’t it be extremely difficult to get the main and the alt in the same match? For example, if you are a plat player, and your alt is in bronze, how would you make it into the same game?
---
[This would be good too.](https://imgur.com/a/SkgEOOJ)
---
&gt; Overwatch got way more players playing pvp then guildwars 2 will ever have
---
That’s a really weird comparison considering that outside of 1 month of the year, Overwatch is an exclusively pvp game. 
---
Yes, as long as you have the corresponding expansion unlocked, you get access to the elite specs of a profession in PvP regardless of whether you've fully unlocked the elite specs in PvE. However, if you do go this route, I suggest testing builds on training dummies or class AI dummies in the PvP lobby before entering a match so as to not spoil the match for others by playing a build or class you're completely unfamiliar with. 
---
So I brought the game last month and right now I've only been able to login daily for the rewards and not commit yet due to time constraints. 
---
At the moment I'm hitting a bag wall, what can I do to help with this? What is the cheapest/best way to obtain more bag space? I've got 1 silver and some coppers lol still in the same starter zone and level 3 (like I said I havnt been able to start actually playing yet).
---
&gt; sometimes don't even play the match
---
fuck you :)
---
&gt; Also, these updates do take company time (which in the business world == money) to update these and roll the changes out.
---
It was 1 or 2 devs working on their own time.
---
You can only do it with a total makeover kit, not a hairstyle kit.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/82i8tg/charr_horns_glow_glitch/
---
Not in the US they haven’t.  It’s packs of 10 hot dogs for packs of 8 buns here.  You only get 8 hot dogs if you buy bun length ones.
---
Someone made one lol. 
---
Aand I got to the Eye of the North in GW1 and now am collecting the thingies in GW2. Thank you for your help. Damn, GW1 story is good, and whoa the ice looks so much better than in GW2.
---
Dayum, I love your style.
---
Boring, poorly designed and/or rewarding maps tend to not see much activity.
---
Mons checks all those boxes and is one of the few maps that does so.
---
Hey! Thanks for the questions - because the last tourney we had had some issues with contestants not being available for the event due to other commitments, we are opening registration the Monday before. The tourney is open to anyone who is willing to participate, but limited to the first 16 entrants. The bracket will be based on the questions asked in the sign up form.
---
I probably need to post this too, but I appreciate Chaotic1 for taking initiative and getting the event posted here! :D
---
You can always buy the Hebrew National brand and get seven per pack to shake things up. 
---
Would a gtx 970m be good enough? I’ve been looking to get a bigger monitor than my laptop screen
---
&gt; A) The adds aren't as easily taken out with most instabs as you make it seem 
---
If you have a half decent pug team they really are. Communication can go along way. Ofc pugs are still a mixed bag but its better to try to get everyone one the same page than just death march your way to defeat.
---
&gt; B) that the fight was, as said, clearly not developed with instabs in mind which makes "doing the fight as it was designed to be" sometimes not an option.
---
There is not a single combo of instabilities where clearing the adds is not conducive to success. All of the examples you list and be mitigated by having less adds to deal with.
---
&gt;Trying to take out all of them before proceeding to damage Crowe further, especially while entering &lt;30% HP territory might however not be the best option
---
I can get behind this if you already do not have more adds to deal with than your team can handle. If your team can not handle the add/boon spam and what ever else instabs are going off you and your team need to consider taking steps to lessen that shit, ie clear out the adds. 
---
Sirens reef is add/boon heavy well beyond any other fractal. If the adds are killing you like OP said (A constant stream of large numbers (10-20) of trash adds that are dealing 5k per hit from behind is crippling for pugs) Killing the adds is a path to success because while more adds will spawn in as the fight goes on the adds that do spawn are finite for the crowe fight. Dead shit cant hurt you, and before you bring up last laugh you can stun/daze them before they die and there will be no last laugh aoe when they die.
---
To each his own, but I learned the layout pretty quickly. Even the secret shortcuts to the her points, or between the layers. My favorite zone by far, followed by Draconis Mons.
---
I think most people are just lazy and hate exploration and learning the environment. These are the same players who stand on top of an undiscovered PoI and whine in /m, instead of thinking it might be actually in a cave below them, or somewhere above them.
---
There is a material storage where items like copper ore and jute scraps go, if you click on the gear next to the X to close your inventory there is an option to deposit all and that will make your crafting supplies go into the material storage
---
You may need to repair your client?
---
I think the nuhoch wallows are pretty lame, and that they should have used chak tunnels instead. Makes more sense lore-wise.
---
Kinda sad there's almost nothing down there.
---
They want you to buy 3 packs of buns and 4 packs of hot dogs to match.
---
Clever, I know.
---
The Big Hotdog and Big Bun industries figured out this scheme lifetimes ago 
---
Sweet solitude 
---
Ah, thank you.
---
I assume, to view the items I deposited I would need to visit a bank, right?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
That would make 18 and 32, but I think you just said it backwards and mean 24 and 24.
---
Now I am trying to determine if they want the average family of 4 to overeat and have 6 hot dogs each, or if they want people to only eat hotdogs at large get togethers. Hmmmm.
---
I use the wizard hat for my ele, so he just sort of looks like a hat on legs.
---
A hat and beard on legs would look amazing.
---
Also the fastest way to make yourself look like a asshole. 
---
&gt;Did the original Guild Wars face any backlash when it came to release Factions?
---
GW1 received *praise* for Factions. Especially since it was not a stereotypical caricature of Chinese &amp; Japanese culture, but rather they did a lot of research and explooration into lesser represented aspects of that culture.
---
Firstly, Kaineng Ciity was an interesting look at contemporary China. The closer you got to the Imperial Sanctum, the more more "traditional" it begins to look, with beautiful pagodas and red architecture. However, further south you go, the architecture changes to overcrowded buildings made of splintering wood, overcrowded and so dense it blocks out the sunlight. This contrast between the Palace near Kaineng Center and the further areas south like Wajjun Bazaar are representative of common folk trying to survive in the overcrowded urban environment, who have little time for tradition.
---
Had this been another MMO, all of Kaineng City would be generic red pagodas and beautiful gardens with statues. But they didn't do it like that. They were very inspired when they designed Kaineng City, to the point that it was based on a [real life location](https://www.reddit.com/r/GuildWars/comments/8swfuv/kaineng_city_in_real_life_macau/) in China called Macau. (I believe a similar setting was also used in the anime 'Kill la Kill'.)
---
Then you had the Kurzicks, who again, are not the generic Asian representation. Rather, they borrow heavily from the Japanese and European Gothic inspirations. The Japanese inspirations can be found by the way Kurzicks do their hair and their extremely pale skin, resembling that of a Kimono girl or Geisha. As for the reasons for their German references, I believe it's because during Edo period Europe had sent many Christian missionaries to Japan, which built up an underground culture of Japanese Christians who lived outside the main empire, much like how the Kurzicks live outside Kaineng. It's very possible the inspiration for Kurzicks may have been what Japan perceived Christianity and Europe to be like. (However, if anyone knows a better source for Kurzick culture, let me know.)
---
As for the Kurzicks and even minor factions like the Crimson Skull, China historically had a big problem with pirates over the centuries, developing their own power alongside the empire. Extra Credits has a great video on China's pirates: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-p2lhxUqMMQ
---
You've seen through my plan to sell him unequal amounts again, so he has to buy even more...
---
I must go now.
---
A lot of people smoke.
---
I still need that henge. Lol
---
I'm saying that no matter how much you think "Everyone knows something" there is going to be someone who doesn't. Clearly there is going to be a difference between an exceedingly popular book series/movie franchise that came out years ago and a Living World episode that came out last month. Do what what you will with that information, I ain't the boss of you.
---
Thanks a bunch!
---
ram is not even close as fast as the vram tho.  
---
once your vram is at the point of overflowing into your ram you will get a good chunk of performance decrease. virtual memory on the harddrive would be the killer i think. :D
---
I really like these spontaneous goofy moments, and the gw2 community seems to have them in abundance.
---
Yes, I'm sure one of the most popular MMOs in the world is on maintenance mode, totally. Dead game amirite?
---
Careful now, ANet might take their famed lightning fast anti-cheater policy and *maybe* ban you in 6 months. Or just ban random dude, it's not like they check it.
---
Most generation 1 legendaries require multiple crafting professions if you intend to do it all yourself.
---
Then maybe instead of adding an option for +6 they could replace that drop from the encryption box table?
---
&gt;8 hot dog wieners weight 1lb. So it was easier to sell 8 of them cause you would only need to pay for 1lb since meats are usually sold by the pound. So it was easier on the butchers.
---
This makes sense, but in Canada we weigh everything via grams/kg :\
---
Just about a month ago in the winter sale on steam it was 15€ for the trilogy and 7,50€ for EotN and apparently there was a sale in november too (wasn't it on sale during the GW2 sale too?).
---
Anyway while it is cheaper than the current price on steam I still think it's a bit pricey and for people who don't have much money to spend it's still better to wait for a steam sale.
---
This thread made my phone crash. 
---
Correct. Honestly I'd recommend just buying them - the cost difference between buying vs selling is pretty small, and you only need 10. Buying costs ~15-20g more than crafting at most. 
---
Ahh, I wasn't sure. As I mentioned elsewhere, the pricing decisions were probably based of the current base digital prices of the content included, which adds up to about $60.
---
The first big metas I encountered in GW2 were Silverwastes and soon after VB. I think they were the most rewarding and co-op friendly moments I have had in GW2, and it's what got me hooked. I couldn't stop farming and enjoying them. They definitely need to make a big meta like VB in the next expansion, GW2 really shines at making people work together. 
---
haha so funny lol 
---
Literally never heard of any of those games
---
The point of the rankedQ is to have a competitive pvp environement. There's no need to make it even less competitive than it's already is. If you make it teamQ, you'll create a competitive environement for about 15 players.
---
I'm not saying what we have now is good or even remotely competitive, but at least, it's a solid foundation. We have ranked for solo Q competition and ATs for teams.
---
I'm doing these:
---
1. LS4
---
2. Griffon quest
---
3. Spec collections
---
There is of course other end game content that is always available, raids, fractals, achievement hunting. Depends on what you like.
---
eRP
---
To be honest ive only played a couple campaign maps XD the editor is a lot of fun though! If you try out the map i would appreciate any feedback, especially regarding balance.
---
There's tons of things you can do, it really depends on what tickles your fancy: 
---
- Raids
---
- Fractals
---
- Collections (this is a massive category)
---
- WvW
---
- sPvP
---
- World Completion
---
- Crafting (legendaries, ascended)
---
- Living World Seasons
---
- Level another profession
---
- Fashion Wars
---
Weaver is definitely not recommended to people who are just starting and apparently have problems with survivability in T4.
---
I main Weaver, i know all the ins and outs of the spec, so i rarely struggle in T4. But when there are shitty instab combinations like Frailty, Outflanked and We Bleed Fire, i go down very easily if the team isn't really good.
---
Plus, to effectively play Weaver, you need to know every fractal's mechanics so you know when to dodge, to not die and be a liability to the team.
---
No, even if it is an increase I'd still happily pay that amount (plus more) for such an amazing game
---
Well, but in germany we have the same problem with burger pattys and buns. :P
---
It does play much like Fire Emblem! It has inspired so many recreations of Fire Emblem maps already.
---
It takes a lot of work to make new faces and all their slider options, likely significantly more work than just making some new weapon skins that'll make five times as much money. If Anet does still have people who work on faces/hairs (and they haven't moved to another company) they're probably busy with other aspects of the gem store or upcoming content.
---
The problem is compounded because people who have exhausted the current options probably have lots of TMKs already hanging out in their banks. Not only are faces/hairs a hassle to make, but 80% of the people who'd use them are sitting on kits waiting for them to come out and Anet barely makes a buck off it.
---
The new human options in PoF were amazing, but as far as new hairs and faces for all races and genders go I'd expect to see them continuing to decline.
---
I didnt' know Steam was region based. Pretty interesting indeed. I wonder why that is. 
---
Then make your own patty's, out of 500 g minced meat you can perfectly make 4 patty's. Or 2 really large ones, depending on the umber of buns you have.
---
Plays similar, but fewer RPG elements. You really only have any investment in your commander, everyone else is expendable and you can train new units during battles.
---
Jesus, you been away that long?
---
That makes them standalone not separate games. Its unusual but other games have had standalone expansions before.
---
It could still prevent a dodge if they wanted it to function that way. Either way, it would still root someone, preventing movement. 
---
You can stop now.
---
I remember the phrase "as we move from season 4 directly to season 5," but was there another source where they confirmed no expansion in between?
---
I could kind of see that phrase meaning they don't expect to miss a beat on LW when the expansion drops, but I think they did specify no expansion somewhere, just can't remember for sure. Could someone point me towards the source?
---
Stop smoking?
---
I know the struggle! I wanted to triple the map size so that I could fit more detail but my first legendary in Guild Wars 2 won't make itself!
---
Getting the map currency was way worse for sure... at least there were no hearts and the metas were relatively short, didn’t require a ton of coordinated people for collection achievements, and were more fun
---
The titles are the reason why I'm not selling as well.
---
Crafted a bunch of +10s and the +14 for savant, and now waiting for my stacks to go up fir the +16.
---
I can't say their hairstyles are shit? Your argument is shallow and nonsensical. By the same logic we should have faces with dick tattoos in them cause there's this X tribe that does so. The thing is, traditional africans are 0.001% of the GW2 population, and their culture is clearly completely disregarded by the huge majority of the population, so there's no excuse as to "these hairstyles exist IRL".
---
Don't be afraid to hassle me if it is unbalanced, unfun, or too unfaithful to Queensdale (Though I suspect this is a pick 2 situation)! This is my first map and I am sure I can improve much with a little criticism.
---
Most of that was not at all related to Guild Wars but I'm not at *all* surprised you did it. Bravo if that's how you like to try get your points across.
---
The definition of comparison is "To examine in order to note the similarities or differences of." You compared Guild Wars 1 &amp; 2 while telling someone else not to, and then tried to rewrite the definition of the word 'compare.' Not much of a discussion to be had, honestly...
---
First time playing the game parhaps. That's not in the scenario op describes, boosting anothrr character. He seems to be arguing the chore of leveling adds some kind of emotional connection with the character. In my opinion it's just time investment, it doesn't matter if you spend it 1-80 in over or boost to 80 and spend the time in WvW.
---
This world, when that game is a ten year old game. You don't sell ten year old games for $40, not unless, at bare minimum, you completely rebuild the thing from the ground up with modern day graphical standards.
---
I get the feeling they designed the tile set to be very nostalgic. This similarity was my first thought too.
---
You already got some great answers but I think it's worth linking to [discretize's builds](https://discretize.eu/builds) as they have a lot of info on fractals and the meta builds for them. Reaper is still considered a good power class and funny enough, many of the meta builds run greatsword (soulbeast, dragonhunter, hybrid firebrand, and warrior when on spellbreaker or when CC isn't needed). 
---
[Yes, you did.](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/pt/dicionario/ingles/argument)
---
&gt;Literally no one here agrees with you.
---
Another bad argument, you either prove your point or give up. That's some childish falacy.
---
Now, if you will, please go ahead and explain how thinking traditional african hairstyles look like shit makes me racist. Do you even know the definition of racism? 
---
Yeah when they ended multimapping in Tarir I was relieved.
---
Well then clearly you are the target market for them. I, as someone who doesn't own them, but might like to try them out, am clearly not the target audience here. 
---
Bloodstone fen is the best map to get keys for map completion from though. Doesn't take longer than 5 mins lol :P
---
Was it the same team for both of those? Man I love sandswept, the atmosphere is great.
---
Also I'm super I did map exploration before finishing the episode, since I haven't gone back for emotional reasons lol it was a really nice map though. 
---
lol it was a joke about the weekly key farm. Completing the first part of the personal history gives you a BLC key (with a limit of 1 key per week).
---
Had a game like this a couple nights back also at Silent Storm. Had an offline teammate at the start, he joined about a minute in, but it took a while for him to get mixed in as we had just wiped, and so we too were down nearly 200 points. 
---
It took everything, including a prolonged harass to deny them at far, and a super lucky break where we simultaneously wipe most their team at mid, and get both Stillness and Tranquility while they're mostly running back - using all the map mechanics for that double points tick 3cap was basically the winning stroke
---
Just recently did 100% on my main in TD and it's such a good map, such diverse biomes even. And the music! I love the orge camp the most :) 
---
Ooooh I see. Good to know!
---
I've killed those bosses plenty of times while exploring the map with alts, looong after it came out.
---
Light a commander tag during the pre-events, warn people, start an lfg. Shouldn't be too much trouble getting it done.
---
Consistent Inconsistency: Anet Level.
---
Good enough to carry groups with strong heals and/or some boons, not good enough to be considered meta.
---
Mounts are awesome but not required to make travel feel meaningful. Walking and gliding through HoT zones feels dangerous, but satisfying. 
---
If you really desperately want your mounts before you do anything else, you'll have to buy PoF, that's right. 
---
Anet is retarded for making recipes like this. 
---
model?
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdzvLZtMmHY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hdzvLZtMmHY) this was the moment i started to love this map.
---
After i got a mastery point i used the tunnel next to it and was greeted with this guy.
---
Well, you can have both. There is plenty of 3440x1440 100-120Hz ultrawide monitors.
---
Sadly GW2 optimisation is just tragic. But at least you can enjoy those extra Hz in some other games.
---
It was. I hope you will come back for the next episode!
---
Oooh yes get me some stretchy pants with my class symbols on them and colored accordingly and I'll wear the heck out of them.
---
in before nerf!
---
It's the problem with the "new map, new shinies, new metas every release" mentality Anet has, eventually what happened with this map happens to the others and content that requires multiple players to complete becomes harder to achieve, or outright impossible.
---
Elona is based on African culture. The faces and hairstyles were added with the Elona-centered expansion. They are entirely appropriate for ELONIAN characters. When you slap one of the hairstyles on a pale skinned, blond, European styled character, which you did in your example, it will look silly to you. That does not make the hairstyle "retarded". It does make you look like an ignorant ass, though. So if that's what you were going for, you've done a superb job.
---
FUCK!
---
[Support tempest](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/heal/) is fine, but really only as a secondary healer. I'd still want a druid for the boons and damage buffs that they provide first. In fractals you'd be better off with a druid for more group damage or in the more experienced groups just another DPS and no healer.
---
Wow...

The [Against the Mouth of Mordremoth](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Against_the_Mouth_of_Mordremoth) event in Dragon's Stand is happening simultaneously with the [Hearts and Minds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hearts_and_Minds) story step.
---
Actually, yes. Almost since release but the downvotes are nice for not knowing.
---
Gems to gold most likely
---
Simple break down: Do condi builds start out a fight dealing their full dps immediately? No. This is because while their skills will on average deal as much damage to the boss as their power counterparts, that damage comes in small packets over the next 10-30 seconds.
---
Now, when you leave the boss, yes all of your conditions will be ticking on the boss. But when you stop to think about it, those conditions boil down to previously used weaopon/utility skills that had hit the boss BEFORE you left. Their full damage is still "catching up", so to speak, where as a power class would have done all the damage at the time the ability hit.
---
While you are away from the boss, you are not hitting it with weapon/utility abilities. This applies equally to both condi and power builds. (Yes some have ranged capabilities but for every Mirage Scepter there is a Holo Rifle. This isn't about specific classes anyways.) This means *you are not applying the damage from those weapon/utility skills to the boss*, regardless of WHEN the boss actually takes the damage. Both types of damage put off additional damage on the boss, one just has their damage drop spread over a longer period of time.
---
Do we need visuals here? I can make some graphs and parse some arc logs if you *still* don't get it.
---
Did Wayfarer’s Henge mentally destroy that many people?

YES.

I think that there are legendaries and other craftables that require the +6 infusion, am a noob but I always thought the +6 was an intended anomally. The progression has been there for a while, doesn't make sense to change it since you get a lot of agony resist if you're doing fractals that aren't the +6s

The battles happen simultaneously.  The thing that likely throws people off is the extra dialogue with Laranthir in Dragon's Stand if you've killed Mordremoth already.  He explains there, to justify the boss battle still happening, that the Mouth is the physical manifestation of Mordremoth's hunger remaining in the world after his mind's death.  If you haven't completed Hearts and Minds on that character, though, Laranthir will say something entirely different about you needing to find a way into Mordremoth's mind to finish him for good.

I understand everyone's frustration with this map. I mean, jeez, it was daunting the first two times I did map completion for TD. But it's frustration of exploration doesn't come from TD being designed \*poorly\* but rather being really WELL designed.

It was ANet's \*intent\* for you to get lost, and for this map to TRULY feel like a tangled mess that's deep exploration wise. I mean, it's called Tangled Depths for a reason, and it really lives up to its name. I really do appreciate this map for how deep it feels. How many nooks and crannies there are. How much depth this map really has. Once you explore it all, you take a moment in some areas and go 'wow, this area of the map feels SO big'. Heck, sometimes I'll be in one area of the map and then later, I'm in a different part of the map, and forget that it's THE SAME MAP.

The causeway doesn't feel like the same part of the map as the Rata Novus area for example. Like holy crap, there's SO much packed into this map, it's insane. I love it.

I didn't cry at all, just speculating, and it would add up given the amount of time between the release of both games. I do doubt another game would even be revealed for at least another few months (around when season 5 begins). The only reason I would want a gw3 is for a better engine so the game can run smoother, assuming it's like gw2.

&gt; deeply retarded and unusable faces/hairstyles

I don't have to prove anything. You literally called the Elonian style faces and hair "deeply retarded and unusable" and that no one uses them un-ironically. You never once imagined that someone might want to make an Elonian character, which these hairstyles and faces were designed to work with. If you had just said "I think these hairstyles look terrible", that would not have been racist. However, you went well beyond reasonable doubt as to your position. You made my argument for me. You showed your hand and are now clutching your pearls SO HARD after having been called out. You're following the racist playbook nearly step by step. I am no longer engaging you on this. Feel free to continue to blather, though. Every comment just digs the hole deeper. Have fun!
