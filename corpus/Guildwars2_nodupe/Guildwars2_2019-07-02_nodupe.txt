I've spent about 250$ in the 4 years playing the game. I bought the initial ultimate pack that was 100$ because I knew I'd enjoy the game when I started playing. Needless to say it is possible at least in gw2 to not spend a lot of money. However there are cases  where collecting everything is a hobby people enjoy, especially when they think an item looks cool. I considered collecting everything in the game I can, but decided to stop that collector's mind set my first year when you need black lion keys to do so. What helped me not spend too much money on this game over time was realizing there are only a few prestigious items in the game cosmetically to get. Such as getting legendary raid armor, raid wing 6/7 chairs, PvP legendary armor, wvw legendary armor, red celestial infusion, and a few other things. I love the outfits in the gemstore and some black lion weapon skins, but just knowing to get them is swiping your credit card or gold farm in a map for so many hours makes me think the value of that cosmetic is garbage tier. I do agree that the game makes you initially ugly to get you to spend and annoying with limited inventory space. I also had to buy space, but not expensive. So, I hope by telling you all this you reconsider buying gemstore items next time when they aren't prestigious to show off. 
---

---
Especially mount skins in this game. None of them show you did something in the game to show off. Skins like the starfall set looked amazing at release, now they look like garbage because everyone purchased it. Hope things get better.
---
---
---
Literally bought 2 inventory full of rocks.
---
I deserve a post too.
---
&gt; Generally the type of person who would gamble their paycheck away, won't really care how long it takes. Minutes, hours, days, doesn't matter. They will gamble the whole thing away.
---
That seems like something that would need a study to back it up.
---
it's one of the easiest healers too, staff 4 is really good for topping people up, and pop F2 and barf five 1 in a row on the group. Save for the occasional F2 skill 5 for condi clear, it's all you really need to know.
---
Maybe a bit off-topic -- if every dragon has a herald, what do we think Bubble's is at this time? Have we seen anything that fits the bill for it?

Qadim the Peerless will stay alive at zero point zero percent indefinitely if there's an add tethered to him, that was fun to find out the first time I led training on him on launch week Sunday night üòÇ

A failed journalist that has since shifted to making big patreon bucks by pandering to the gAmErS RiSE UP demographic with endless outrage-bait videos. Similar to other channels like YongYea.
---
Hmmmm. Now that is good info.
---
Let's see if I can convince someone to let me try it....
---
&gt; Some game, some businesses, some product will always try to find a loophole. 
---
How is that a justification for not trying? There's no reason you can't both have regulation *and* try to have support for gambling addiction. Both would have positive impacts. Providing that support can even be *part of the regulation*.
---
Welp I‚Äôll be making my way over to Dragonfall now lol

[This](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vRAQNBhOD7kjGodTslGwxGgeTskLYQBgGwKIeKmFHjUlh3QzC-jxRBABUq+DAPEA80NY8FAQjjAgZKBva/R5X7gDAf91Xf91XNgXf91Xf91Xf91XBA-e) is the exact build I run.
---
Scholar Runes are expensive so go with Eagle until you have the extra gold.
---
You can use any heal you want, really. I use the Blood Fiend in most raids and swap between Your Soul is Mine and Comsume Conditions in open world depending on what I'm dealing with.
---
You can also get rid of You Are All Weaklings if you don't think you need a stunbreak and sub in Shadow Fiend for more dps/lifeforce.
---
You can also sub out Bone Fiend instead of Chilled to the Bone if you want more frequent CC and a little extra dps.
---
But if you do decide to get rid of the shouts, swap the Augury of Death trait out for Chilling Nova.
---
And since you're having troubel with survivability, pay attention to the Soul Eater trait in the Reaper line. It heals you for 5% of the damage you do while in melee range. You can heal for quiet a lot if you Reapershroud #4 on a large group of mobs.
---
Presumably whatever filled the role for thr DSD is near the DSD and thus unseen by Tyrians like the rest of anything directly related to the DSD.
---
As an Asura, my favorite story episode was the Infinity Ball. Super important for LS1. That was about it.
---
Dungeons really were never hard. If anything they were just horribly balanced. There was nothing skillful about getting oneshot by sniper in a cramped Caudecus's manor hallway.
---
i just wonder if this has any effect at all on longevity or if it's a non-issue. i'm definitely not in THE WORLD IS ENDING mode but i'm also very curious being in this limbo of "what's next" from arena net
---
Actually feels bad.
---
1. Why should someone go out of their way to proof something to a person with such a trollish behavior?
---
2. If you dislike "kill monsters, get loot, rinse, and repeat." being a core of the gameplay, maybe MMOs arn't for you generally? There can be amazing stuff around these elements (lore, competetive modes, a plurality of mechanics, activities such as races) that make the game more interesting (and gw2 has all of the ones mentoned before), but fundamentally these elements tend to be a key game play element, because many people like them.
---
One would hope that, at most, they remove loot boxes tied to real money, letting you get your fix from other avenues. Though the way things are going, you're right, the backlash might end up a bit harsher than is strictly necessary.
---
What ‚Äúpoint‚Äù does any MMO have? I thought the whole point of MMOs is that every player decides how to play it, you know, freedom and all that. I really fail to see how a game should have a ‚Äúpoint‚Äù other than entertain. 
---
Would you consider WoW‚Äôs ‚Äúpoint‚Äù to be grinding up your item level so you can keep raiding every night until the next expansion resets everything and you have to start it all over? Or would it be collecting every mount skin in the game? Some players enjoy the first, some players go for the second. The same happens in GW2.
---
thanks bot
---
There's that awkward chest inside an aoe in starter zones, that's about the only tutorial we have for dodging..
---
loot grind?
---
There is a reason I worded the title that way.
---
I can get behind that, man. Also understand people having fun and doing that. It's just that ... i don't. Anyways, hope you'll get it one day!
---
Hardly even gold, that's my biggest problem. Still dislike mist lord though. Mistforged Mistlord's weapons of the mist.
---
This has nothing to do with an account roll back though. They usually mail you the items if they accept your request.
---
&gt;every community is just crumbling and hollowing out around me. I've got no one left to play with anymore.
---
THIS. THIS is actually my complaint, as any honest observer could tell from the second paragraph of original post. 
---
The rest of the original post is really just, basically, "look how lazy, sloppy, and dumb your Skinner Box is." 
---
If I could find ten or twenty people with whom to form a decent, active, fun, non-toxic guild, I'd be happy indefinitely. So far, in more than six years of playing GW2, I haven't found that. Every time a decent group starts to coalesce around a single banner, it lasts a couple weeks, and then dissolves. Either people's real life shit pulls them away from the game (no fault of ArenaNet, there), or the game isn't compelling enough to keep them playing it (I *do* blame ArenaNet for that), or they leave because they get sick of the vast majority of development effort being spent on cosmetic bullshit and the addiction-oriented microtransaction market. 
---
Where is the ***community***? Maybe it wouldn't be so hard to find if ArenaNet put real community-building tools in players' hands. Instead, they've given them enough rope with which to hang themselves, and that's about it. Even guild halls are bullshit, because people just sink a huge amount of time and resources into the guild hall for the perks, but no one hangs out there. They're mediocre mausoleums to a joint exercise in futility that lasted until the guild hall got all the perks people cared about. For what? A few extra percentage points towards magic find or karma or whatever? Some gathering nodes? Woopity doo! That's a piss poor substitute for real *community*.
---
They need to fix Projectile Physics first, srsly play some hours of WvW and try to teleport / use ranged Abilities.
---
The [Rage](https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/03/07/shutterstock_head_wall.jpg?x=442&amp;y=293&amp;crop=1) building up is insane - it boggles my mind how shit like this got released.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Ranger Longbow has Projectiles with bulletdrop, increasing their range from 1500 to around +1800 somewhat. That ballistic trajectory is broken as fuck, now look at Thief Rifle and Pistols, you shoot straight wich leads to a lot of wallclipping and thats just the tip of the iceberg, don't get me started.
---
Its a combination of map design and physics in this game wich needs to get fixed.
---
If I fucking fall through the ground once more ...
---
&gt; The game is called "Guild Wars 2". Guild. Wars.
---
Read the [lore](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Guild_Wars)...
---
If you remember the weapon competition a while back the template files had certain hilt lengths for standardisation. Probably for animation I guess.
---
The exotic crafting back pieces are lv 78 but have lv 80stats. If you want you could invest a little more time and get one of the hot or pof ascended story back pieces or buy one for ls3 map currency.
---
To be fair, GW2 has a minimal loot grind, but having to have a bunch of different sets for different game modes--while not as bad as some other games--is still annoying AF. 
---
Example: Agony is fucking pointless. Why do that? Why even have agony? Just so you have to spend a lot more time and effort grinding in fractals, that's why. It's hyper-specialization with high opportunity costs with, at best, lackluster rewards.
---
The game was released too early, so a lot of endgame stuff was rushed/unfinished like PvP and Dungeons.
---
*Throws upgradeable mistforged mistlord glowy sparkly stuff onto weapon*,
---
Oh it's so pretty - GW2 community
---
We hope that they would be able to survive themselves on straight up microtransactions alone.
---
S1 was what ramped up the difficulty and taught players to fight with a more action-oriented style.
---
Even S2 is too much of a difficulty spike from Personal story. You would not believe how many people go down in seconds fighting that first inquest golem boss. 
---
If S1 doesn't come back, all these player will be going from riding a tricycle to riding a moped without doing the bicycle and training wheels first.
---
Just one more reason why S1 NEEDS to come back as soon as they are done with setting the festivals on auto.
---
Elite specs were thought of and designed not on the fly. If they are planned, you can bet that they already have clear visuals designed and general skilltree for about a year or two now, if not more.   
---
Now, addressing other points:  
---
\- It being harmful  
---
It's evident that ANet's balance is about "reworking when it's safe to". They do a sweeping pass and redefine specs after new ones are on the table. It was more or less great for most HoT specs, as Reaper was finally allowed to have a clear power focus, Druid got a much deserved gut kick for making any other kind of support build just obsolete, Chrono can actually have a fun DPS build now. Arguably, if they'll add new specs we can expect same kinds of changes to PoF specs following after - which is good.  
---
\- It's main feature  
---
It's far from truth. Selling point of expacs is "season pass" for LW stuff, new maps, stat combos and story. Those are the main selling points.  
---
To realize this, ask yourself: Would people consider it an expac if it had no new elite specs, but only aforementioned features? Would people consider it an expac if it had only elite specs introduced, in contrast?  
---
Also keep in mind that they specifically stated that they are going to stop making a map for each new release of LW, so it is highly likely that elite specs will be implemented as main "log in reason" instead.   
---
Now, would legendary runes grab people's attention? Very unlikely.   
---
Build templates? I can see it being a mastery, unfortunately, so it's likely going to be implemented as such to make you log in for new LW without it adding a map, can quote me on that, chief.   
---
Reward and crafting systems reworks are nebulous, but they did mention work on those, as well as legendary runes and sigils.   
---
Elite specs are a very strong possibility, and tbh would be quite welcome more so than dangerous.
---
**Mistforged** Branded Gilded Lord's Weapon Set of the Mists.
---
There is nothing else to read. You don't like guilds, you don't like MMORPGs, that's it.
---
You complain about random stuff most of the players really like, but don't even make any suggenstions for any improvements. What's the actual point of your post? You don't like GW2? Okay, there are many other MMORPGs out there, you may should play an other one, it's not a thing. You don't like MMORPGs? It's also okay, there are also many other genres to play out there. 
---
But baseless complaining about random stuff for no reason and most importantly with no "how would it be better"... that's just nonesense. Other people would call it hate.
---
it would probably significantly reduce development time for Anet too I guess.
---
Actually it was a serious question and your answer is a parody video?...
---
My assertion that you have little understanding of game design is based on your statement, that you cannot understand how Anet spends so much time with so little output and followed this up with the claim most development time would go into gemstore content.
---
While quite a few people have a dislike for TD, it is the Favorit map of me and quite a few others, specifically because it demands the player to actually keep track of where they are and what areas are connected in what way more actively (or did when encountering the map for the first few times). Some of us have been asking for more maps like TD for a long time. That is not to say that all maps should be like this. ANet is creating different types of maps to facilitate different types of experience. TD was designed to give players the experience of getting lost in the undergrowth of a jungle and did a fantastic job. It's still fair that you dislike it - but again this is subjective. 
---
If you like Dragonfall so much (for me it's my 2-3rd Favorit LS4 map) however I do not understand why you are so sceptical about the direction the game is moving towards: if the latest datapoint is the best in a long time, shouldnt that signal good (or at least better) things to come for the future?
---
&gt;"it's sorted by last time played so there is a way to organise them, just not usefull one"
---
LOL! You are not wrong.
---
&gt;"building a guild take time and skill to manage it and it's member, what do you want from anet about it ?"
---
How about an in-game LFG tool? How about actually making Guild Halls a place guilds want to spend time doing stuff together (mini-games, etc.)? Basically, some social and community-building tools are what I'd like to see. 
---
As [Black Mirror](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epI5r0_T_lE) as a social rating system would be, in a community that can be as toxic as GW2's community can be, especially in PvP, I wouldn't even mind implementation of a social scoring system. This "adventurer reputation" could be implemented along with a revived [Personality](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Personality) mechanic, which was originally part of the game, enhancing players' incentives to play in-character while exhibiting admirable / desirable character traits.
---
&gt;It's...really not strange :/
---
Oh the strange part is more how Orr is still about undead. The Khilbron thing I remembered, as I was looking up the "Shards of Orr" dungeon to see if there was a hint of Zhaitan in there as there was Drakkar . . .
---
Axe is super for building up your shroud pool.
---
I think to the OP's point, this may have a lot to do with the personality of individual users. 
---
I've played this game since before the first day it went live. I used to log into the beta weekend to try to plan out my character creation settings so I could get playing immediately at midnight on that first day. I've done the Fashion Wars 2 thing a lot - I once spent an entire week doing nothing in game but standing at the bank trying out different backpieces to find the perfect one to complete my look. Still in all these years I have probably spent around $200 on the Gem store, and only two or three times ever purchased anything cosmetic there - each time, if I recall, with leftover gems from purchasing a bank expander or that sort of thing.
---
Still, I am proud of the way my characters look and invested a great deal of time and effort into them: I just did it through what is available in game without taking out the wallet. 
---
This isn't intended as a knock on you, by any means. I'm just saying that I don't think the game inherently demands people spend money to avoid looking bland, but it does have enough opportunities to change your look for cash to tempt those who are more willing or ready to pull out the credit card.
---
as long as it is in the following format: https://www.lotro.com/en/content/brief-history-time-according-sapience
---
Undo everything and try installing gw2 hook first. Make it work. It should if following the site's instructions.
---
After that, make the test of the instructions as stat d by my tutorial. You shouldn't get confused. Take note of each structure and. Test between additions.
---
If it doesn't work, start a fresh install of gw2 and repeat. It should work
---
 Let me know!
---
You seem to miss that a lot of people really really enjoyed both of the collections (griffon and skyescale). There were complaints about specific parts of the collections and as usual complaints gain more attention on places such as reddit, but overall many people liked that there was significant content associated with them. It was the blocking that stopped people from doing the content that was the issue (and the complaints were fairly exagerated in quite a few cases).
---
tbf while i do have a slight addictive behaviour, i do have 3 thousand dollars in my bank account as real life buffer, for a rental bond, removalist fees, car registration, or just emergencies. i might only spend $100-150 per month on the game, and all my bills and rent and food are paid for in advance and i have no debts
---
the money i have spent ingame was just splurge money, although it could have gone into a holiday fund. i am currently on holidays right now, and i can afford to fly to the beach and spend a couple of days in a nice hotel. but if i hadnt spent money in the game, i might have gone for a whole week instead of the weekend.
---
I say this for every game with micro-transactions. I dislike any type of micro-transaction, no matter if I love or hate the game.  
---
However, if I love the game AND the developers, I'm ok with supporting them enough to make purchases from their shop every once in a while.
---
There are tons of guilds who do use their guild halls to do the things you suggested: Seasonal decorating events, races, jumping puzzles, PvP tournaments, Hide and seek, Puzzle events, RP... you just have to find the right guild for you. In terms of events I've experienced the best ones with SPUD, but there are tons of others doing specific stuff.
---
At the early and mid levels, doing a little bit of everything is good to give you a feel for the game, but the playstyle is very different from what you will experience after you reach 70 and 80. The combat gets much more engaging once unlock all of your skills and alternative weapon. Somewhere around 30ish, you will get a feel for how your character will play throughout the game.
---
As for crafting, you will be able to find better equipment than what you can craft for the majority of the pre-80 content. Even after that, you can usually buy whatever you need from the TP less than or just as much as what it costs to craft. The exceptions are some of the exotic and ascended armors with certain stat combinations that come from the Path of Fire and Heart of Thorns expansions. These are soul or account bound and must be crafted to obtain. 
---
Crafting in the early levels really only does two things:
---
1) It's a good way to level. Getting a crafting profession up to 400 grants around 7 levels worth of experience. This is a constant that stays the same no matter what level you are at. One way to power level is to get the first 15 or so levels naturally (as these go really quick), then raise a couple of crafting disciplines to get anywhere from 8 - 40 levels. Around level 60ish, the game seems to get a little more fun, and there are more options.
---
2) Crafting at lower levels can be profitable. Due to the imbalance in the level of players, some of the mid-tier refined resources (ingots, planks, etc)  sell for more than the higher tier ones, as there are fewer players gathering the mid-tier resources. 
---
If you want to go the crafting route, the dynamic guides at  [https://gw2crafts.net/](https://gw2crafts.net/)  are by far the best and cheapest way to level.
---
One thing that I enjoyed while leveling pre-80 was doing map completions. It added an interesting dynamic to the game that was a nice break from the heart quests and mob killing. Map completion is also one of the ways to acquire a legendary weapon down the line.
---
When I first started playing, another Redditor gave me some of the best advice that I've ever received. H/she told me to use my level 80 boost on an alt character, do the first chapter in the Path of Fire expansion, and unlock the raptor mount for my account. Then, go back to playing and leveling my main character. I extended this to playing Path of Fire just long enough to unlock the raptor and bunny mounts, then created a new character which I leveled to 80 naturally. It was a blast. Exploring the core, the pre-expansion world with mounts is a very different experience. There is a thrill in being able to run through almost any zone (no matter how much much of a higher level it is), carefully dodging mobs and projectiles. Swapping between raptor and bunny to scale geography that was clearly never intended to be scaled.  It's amazing that, unlike almost every other MMORPG that introduced mounts, the developers decided to open almost the entire core world to them, and it fundamentally changes the experience (for the better, IMO).
---
GW2 has a ton of end-game content. Easily triple the amount of the core-world. And while I love playing my level 80 characters, I miss some of the experiences of leveling. There is also a ton of (often dark) GW2 lore, and the core maps do a great job of giving context and providing snapshots of GW2 history. While the expansion stories are very good, they miss some of the sense of history you can get in the core game, and exploring that history while your level can be rewarding.
---
Come on, nobody is watching GW2. Except a handfull of GW2 players, but these players are already paying customers. GW2 streams never attracted a wider audience. Well...maybe that one stream you meantioned. Most gaming magazines/websited didn't even reported when PoF got released. 
---
You are right that a hardcore community is healthy for a game. They host websites, post guides, builds etc. But on the one hand is GW2 old and not going to attract new players. On the other hand is other stuff much more important than raids. Stuff as mounts, housing, fishing. Majority of players is not going to do raids and does not care. See wildstar.
---
Well things are already moving faster. Sure it is not a new ls episode but in the last two-ish months we got updates nearly every second week with the next two updates (wvw event week and festival of the four winds) on the horizon. The demand for updates for the new ls episode or regarding the beginning of a new season is understandable but for me personally quite unimportant at the moment. More than enough to do right now what buys them time. I would not be surprised if the next episode will launch between fotfw and halloween. So around september-ish.
---
I would caution that you should only grind Dragon Bash this way if you genuinely **enjoy** it. Otherwise, work an extra hour at your job, use the money to buy gems, then convert them to gold. Even at $10/hour, that's \~ 160 gold. Whereas farming will net you \~4-5g / hour on a good day.
---
I mean, he specifically makes fun of the gAmErS RiSe Up demographic on his podcast...
---
Cost that you can never get back. My point was that there's no monetary benefit to the player to trying to get a duplicate Koda's Warmth Enrichment. At most, all it means is you can get the effect on two characters.
---
TBH, they should give us a means to get multiple Koda's Warmth Enrichments anyways. But maybe, one day, we'll get that aura wardrobe via the novelty system and can convert it into an aura we can apply to any character (at least, I'd imagine the sixth Novelty system slot is where an "aura wardrobe" would end up, and the only way I see it working would be like the novelties/miniatures, where you "deposit" (aka destroy) the item to get it unlocked to the account, which also means only one aura at a time via this system).
---
&gt;Then maybe they should find a way to monetize that doesn't prey on people?
---
&gt;
---
Yeah, I hope Anet will find a way to keep the game away from these abusive practices, but also monetized enough to keep GW2 afloat for the foreseeable future.
---
It seems to me this will depend on how reliant on the BL Chests their income is, and if they can plan ahead of time how to compensate for it when videogame gambling regulations hits bigger countries like the US.
---
Difficulty/dedication has nothing to do with teamsize/open world. 
---
Open world does not cater to "coop" style players. Open world does not help (smaller) guilds to keep their members busy. People want to play together and they need a reason to do so. Open world is no reason. It's a lot easier to do this content solo, than to ask in guildchat, wait for guildies to have time, port etc. etc. 
---
There is no point in playing open world together with your girlfriend, wife, school- work- or guildmates. Often it even slows you down. You are done with a heart, but must wait for your team. One guy drups down at a vista, all need to wait.
---
Easy instanced teamcontent caters to this audience. As example T1 fractals. A casual guild can go into T1 fractals and so them together as a guild. People need each other, people talk with each other, it strengthens relationsships in your guild. Dungeons and dragons online (only played tutorial) offers quest with three modes: ~ "solo" "team" "difficult" with improved rewards. GW1 requires a team to do story content - but can also be done with npcs. Especially for unexperienced players it is easier to do with a team of human players.
---
I think GW2 needs more "easy teamcontent" as dungeons or teamstorymissions etc. Open world content can't replace this. Same as difficult open world content (see tripple trouble worm thingie) can't replace raids. It caters to a very different audience.
---
I‚Äôm not saying it does, I‚Äôm saying that is the content that was provided by the developer for that demographic of players
---
Yes. I deleted my SAB infusion by accident once. After explaining to support I got the item returned to me on the terms I be more careful. There's no reason you shouldn't be able to have it returned to you for an accident.
---
Hahaha it's fine. Great thing it's working now.
---
Just to be sure add the gw2 folder to your firewall (when you nfoed defender or antivirus ) whitelist so those. Dll are not flagged wrongly.
---
people got excited, then they saw the loot is shit.  
---
with the next rush loot was a bit better....but still shit.  
---
in the end no one cared and it was just another box you got which was gone after a while.  
---
now no one even remembers boss rush.
---
You just a whinging bitch. Stop talking for entire community, there is a lot of people including myself who found skyscale collection engaging and rewarding ! With literally no grind. What part of it was grinding ? I finished it doing one collection every second day at a time. You dont like you dont need to get it, but i personally would like to see more of content like this
---
Since i discovered the "Thinking man Scourge" build for Scourge , i have been almost exclusively playing it , its great at supporting your party , has great survivability , great troughput with heals and barriers ( admittedly more barrier than heals ) , and can literally revive AND keep alive your whole party in the most dire of situations. The only negative is the low as heck damage output.
---
[This is the build im refering to. I dont take credit for it , as far as i know its from the youtuber MightyTeapot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPFU28vh5vY) .
---
I highly recommend this build if youre looking for a support type of playstyle.

---
It'd be a bit overwhelming to a newbie, but I like how evil it is :P
---
I've gotten about that many, but nothing this good. Are the drops dependent on your luck level? Mine is just under 100.
---
Is there a summary somewhere of things we know about upcoming content? And/or speculations?
---
Damn that Shield is fine
---
If that was the case, you'd think Anet would be catering to that crowd with the content they make? Although I guess there's plenty of achievements being added to the game with Living Story
---
&gt;It's a shame because the writing has only gotten better
---
...I think you didn't play the latest episode because it was GW2 at its sloppiest.
---
You're right, I haven't played for about 6 months.
---
I like to think that it'd be easier for you to get over missing lootboxes than it's for those with gambling addiction to enjoy the game without problems while the game has lootboxes.
---
Not that I think that's the sole problem in Guild Wars 2 on that front.
---
Does that db include the original .evtc data, or is it just the parsed statistics? I'd imagine the original files would be much larger if kept around.
---
I'm interested in the data too, would love to be able to archive this history.
---
As someone who studied Media &amp; Communications: you'd be surprised of how many things companies and people with power do deliberately.
---
I'll always remember the words of my teacher the third day in class; "Expect to lose many friends, and expect to stop liking many of the series and products you used to like. Once you see how this works, there's no turning back".

Support has the tools to replace the item.  They just won't because they don't want you getting duplicates despite *also* being able to verify what is in your inventory and the history of the account.  If the API can do it, so can support.  This is why I'm afraid to slot my bauble infusions on a serious character or put my koda's warmth on anyone else other than my fractal character.
---
They used to be willing to help, but something made them pissy.
---
While releasing 1-2 at a time seems like a good idea, I could see the rage of the player base if their profession's new elite specialization was released at the end of the season. 
---
I honestly think we're done with elite specializations, they had no intention of another expansion as far as we know.  With the announcement of the WvW event, dual classes seems more likely at this point, especially if they're implemented in slowly (all scholars can select other scholar professions as their secondary, then they get access to another set, and so on).
---
does this map have less invisible walls than the desolation ?! damn
---
I don't think Magic Find influences the drop rate of higher tier gear so much that low tier gear will become rare. It's not like you'll get to 300% and suddenly every armor drop in random open world roaming is a rare or an exotic with a basic once in a blue moon.
---
1/300 drop rate becoming 1/100 doesn't exactly flood the market.
---
...yeah, I could put Exordium on the back burner for that greatsword. Holy moly that's *fine*.
---
Raiders have the most ridiculous persecution complex in this community. It's incredible how obsessed y'all are with acting like you're being persecuted.
---
I'll give a hint, if it were even remotely true this wouldn't be on the front page with 70+% upvotes.
---
The whole genre is unhealthy because it's predicated on exploiting addictive behavior. It is enjoyable, though.
---
Doing this in MMOs is surprisingly hard nowadays, let's see some examples.
---
* Going the FFXIV route, full subscription, you also have to pay for expansions. SE is specially scummy, they're a multy million company with an incredibly valuable IP (to the point it's gonna have a publicitary live action film), and they still *dare* ask for subscriptions, on top of the myrriad of micto transactions they implemented.
---
* Going the WoW route. Subscription based, buy expansions, but you can earn more subscription time with in-game currency. Less scummy than FFXIV but still.
---
* Going out of business the wild way; going completely F2P, and milking everything they can from deals, promotions and lootboxes before sinking.
---
* Doing like Warframe; going completely F2P, monetizing pretty much every aspect of the game, BUT at the same time, making **everything** avaiable through normal gameplay unlocks that take time.
---
* Doing like ESO, putting heavy emphasis on the gameplay elements to give players a substantial ammount of gameplay, but add slight "complications" like inventory slots, in order to get more cash, on top of selling expansions. It would introdice a subscription that would keep away all the "minor issues", of course, at the cost of constant cash.
---
* Like BDO, being shameless and monetizing everything to the ground, even small stuff like auto looting.
---
As you can see, in order to stay afloat as an MMO nowadays, you have to be a scummy scum. Picking any of these is like picking which poison to drink or which body part to be stabbed on, some are less worse than others but everything is still bad.
---
Then there's Path of Exile but being honest, those guys are the exception, not the rule, and who knows how long they will remain like that.
---
We wiped on dhuum at 0.33%, I‚Äôve since killed him but damn that one still stings
---
No, because neither of them are/were journalists.
---
&gt; Why would a raider care if there is an easier mode so ppl can learn better or see the story by playing that? They dont (apart from a minority.)
---
Why would they care if it gave raid specific rewards? Why do they care what other people get?
---
It would be nice to be able to combine into legendary essence
---
The gambling box is the BLC chest. Most of my Gemstore purchases are skins. I think I bought chests once? 
---
I am okay with outlawing the gambling RNG boxes. I am also not sure what will drive business after that. 
---
Is it ethically wrong if whales drive the company when its direct item purchases of skins? This video seems unclear on bothering with these distinctions. Jim is a little radical here in his view of things, which is foretold by his intro which turns every activity into an addiction.

Or just an average day in the lab

Some stuff listed in the [upcoming section](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Upcoming_changes_and_features) on the wiki, stuff mentioned in the ["what's next" post](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/). In general we know we're getting season 5 next and expect it to be similar to seasons 3 and 4.
---
&gt; but it is unclear how this would mesh with the "maps frozen in time" design.
---
They did pretty well with Drytop and Silverwastes in LS2. If they combine this way with the stuff we got in LS4, I think it would end up very nice.
---
While the things that Jim Sterling says are no less on-point than they ever were, I've enjoyed his videos a lot less after learning how he agrees with deplatforming and censoring people.
---
So many people think lootboxes are good. I've seen so many people despaired defending it even with the same argument like EA did even if you tell them it's aimed to easy addicted people and kids they keep defending it specially here on reddit.
---
send this to exploits@arena.net instead of posting it here ._.

Thank you! :)

I love my heal scourge...though I didn't go with Teapot's full magi, I have a mix of shaman/marshal's so I still put out a bit of dps for t4s. It's so much fun and I love being able to walk into a pug knowing I can carry if things get stupid.
---
If America passes the bill it's looking at, then other countries will almost certainly fall in line very fast (except China because China, but w/e). Even if the other countries *don't* fall in line, America banning them results in such a huge "no lootboxes" market that they might as well *be* internationally banned.
---
The question is, though.. will the bill go through? It's got support, but ESA has money and lobbyists, and corruption *does* exist..
---
LAAAAANAAAAAA*?
---
It'd be more correct to say *was* known for, as Epic shitting the bed with EGS has redirected the nerd rage elsewhere. 
---
Partly to do with Epic simply now being the easier target, but primarily because EGS's lack of features and refusal to implement reviews has caused a degree of introspection on the matter. Now, they realise that bad games aren't the issue they were made out to be, and that user-driven soft curation / reviews are more than effective to solve any issues that may have arisen.
---
It could easily be a fractal, or even a raid.
---
A fractal showing Malyck's tree fall to Mordremoth when he first woke would be interesting.

By my stars, guthix must truly be dead

The [options listed here for armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character#Viper.2FHarrier.2FDiviner_Armor). VB specifically gives [bladed armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bladed_armor) which is now all stat selectable. You can get the [bladed armor boxes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bladed_Armor_Box) from participating in the [VB map meta](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Night_and_the_Enemy) [during night time](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Verdant_Brink#Events). Other options for the armor include WvW/PvP reward tracks and buying the boxes from the itzel vendors for 1g and 500 airship parts.

I am gearing myself a Scourge for Vale Guardian and while looking for a replacement skill for [Epidemic] I was curios to know if blinds also work against the blue teleport circle? If so I could use [Well of Darkness] against it. Anyone know what other thing work against the Unstable Magic Spike?, (Vale Guardian casts electric-like blue AoEs on the ground, teleporting and damaging players caught inside them.)
---
Well what exactly are they achieving though? Grinding the same map for hours on end to make some gold, while watching netflix on a second monitor? I understand that his can be fun, I had a some fun back then farming Istan as well, even though I never hardcore grinded it, but I never felt like I was achievement to press 111 and make some money with it. There is definitely better ways, to spend your time ingame, so if you have enough money to convert gems to gold do it.
---
They are going to do an event where u can get ur enemy habilities in wvw. I bet its a test for us to get a second profession like in gw1.
---
They should collapse ls3 into 1 category too for more visibility and something to better indicate which map from a glance
---
Or maybe don't put a Taimi crying scene in almost every single episode?
---
Watch the Q&amp;A at the con where the devs talked about the "death of Aurene" scene. They literally talked, almost with glee, about how a nice "touch" in the moment was to crank up the scene's emotional impact (emotional impact of a moment which was cynically devalued in the first five minutes of the next episode) by having Taimi cry. Specifically her.
---
There are other comments from writers/devs talking about how awesome Taimi's VA is at crying and the power of the emotional impact.
---
Taimi has two modes of existing in the story. She's either the expositon asura replacing story with technobabble to guide the player between story instances (I'm tracking ley line this, dragon magic detected here, the signal was lost there, I need readings from her - it's like 90% of the story when Taimi is on screen) and when she's not exposition asura she's sad or crying, either because she's bravely facing down her illness or because like her use as exposition asura, they found a new use for her as emotional asura.
---
Taimi crying has been shown crying more than any other character in the story (in fact most characters are never shown remotely close to that emotion.
---
&gt;  how dare the writers give her a strong emotional response to the deaths of characters she was close to, like normal people would in her position? I can't believe all this pandering
---
I could buy this argument if the writers were giving a "strong emotional response to the deaths of characters" as a general rule for all appropriate characters (how about every sylvari and Pact member after Trahearne dies, or every sylvari who experienced near-genocide from Mordremoth, or the Pact who were slain by their own).
---
The crying emotional response is reserved for Taimi because it is pandering to an emotional heart string from some players, not because the writers are realistically portraying grief (the sheer loss of life post-HoT is nearly invisible and the other NPCs rarely show "a strong emotional response").
---
Again, I don't have a problem with portraying grief in the story, Taimi crying at all isn't a problem, Taimi crying so often that it has become a GW2 story trope is a problem.
---
The devs did have a discussion once long ago asking players thoughts about Tengu and if they released them playable not being able to use ALL of the existing armor in the game and no personal story how would players feel. It was presented in a hypothetical. They must have at least considered it at some time to pose the question.
---
Exposition asura syndrome. I'm not entirely sure why they introduced Blish, I assume it's to distract from the bad writing Taimi used to emobody (tell the story exposition through asuran technobabble embodied by the primary asuran NPC featured in the episode) but I think the writers are so desperate for us to love Taimi they introduced Blish to take over as exposition asura (a crutch for weak writing) which makes Taimi less annoying.
---
People criticise the Personal Story but this is where is was vastly superior to the current story. The Personal Story does a brilliant job of showing that Zhaitan's defeat is the result of hundreds of heroes from all backgrounds and races. Warriors, strategists, researchers, mages, scholars, spies - all kinds of people played important roles and got to contribute something. Had Dragon's Watch been around at the time, every asuran invention would have been invented by Taimi, every discovery would have been made by Taimi, every problem would have been solved by Taimi.
---
I managed to re-buy something I already owned (stupid outfit "bundles" don't have [YOU ALREADY OWN THIS!] on the outfit). I emailed support, and they refunded my gems and told me to just keep the extra snow scepter thing (this was before we got infinite copies from vendors for free).
---
The obsidian weapons could be awesome if the white parts weren't so prominent. Same with the chunky added parts on the triumphant armor. The sword and dagger are kinda alright.
---
&gt; The best way to do one is to make ZERO changes to any mechanics ONLY change the HP sponginess of the bosses themselves. This way you still are forced to learn mechanics and roles exactly like a normal raid. The DPS checks are just more forgiving, so you don't need as solid rotations or perfect gear. 
---
Alright so let's engage with this idea. There's a few ways this plays out. One is that people can use the lower dps requirements to skip mechanics if their DPS is decent. You can already see this happening the majority of the time with Gorseval, it's common with KC and Xera.
---
Another way it plays out is people start bringing extra healers or gear/builds that offer a lot of survivability instead of dps, allowing them to ignore mechanics that don't one-shot by just living through them. Balls on Qadim, shakes on slothasor (and even the green floor) etc. Finally, it's worth pointing out that quite often, the penalty for failing a mechanic is... decreased DPS. If you effectively remove the DPS checks then that doesn't really matter.
---
As a result, to say that "you still are forced to learn the mechanics and roles exactly like a normal raid" is not realistically true. Of course there are some that would be unavoidable, such as greens on dhuum, but you could ignore an awful lot of mechanics.
---
Here is the reality - *most* dps checks in gw2 are extremely forgiving. If you have a DPS set of some kind - it doesn't have to be perfect, just obviously a DPS set - and something resembling a DPS build and get some boons you will do enough DPS to kill almost anything. You could replace the berserkers items in your raid with marauders and still be fine. Most people who clear raids can't do anywhere near a perfect rotation even on a target dummy, never mind in an actual fight. Most raids do not wipe because the people in there aren't good enough DPS. If they fail a DPS check, it is because of failing mechanics.
---
However let us just say that you do need to do mechanics - as noted, you will still need to do *some*. The idea of going through a learning process of new mechanics and particular roles within a fight is a big part of why people don't raid in the first place. They simply don't want to either take the time or be challenged to do something like that. The other big part of why people don't raid is the time/hassle of getting ten people.
---
The only way you're going to make an appreciable impact on these is by making the mechanics not matter or just removing them entirely - so even trying to do make easy modes without doing that to a bunch of the mechanics is, I'm afraid, missing the point. You either have to commit to making mechanics irrelevant or give up on the idea of an easy mode. If you want to make an easy mode, the question at that point is simply about how much of the fight are you willing to gut to make it easier.
---
&gt; And no, I can say that I know many people who would get in to raids if they felt the initial barrier for entry was a little lower, and that they had a better environment for learning the mechanics first. It would 100% add more raiders to the community.
---
Well that's entirely possible but you need to realize that the fight has to be pathetically easy so that you can fail mechanics and still defeat the fight if you want to create that environment. Like fractals... there are more people doing fractals than raids I'm sure, but anyone who has played through the tiers can tell you that the majority of people working through the lower tiers have no idea how the mechanics work because you don't really need to know much of anything until tier 3.
---
I don't think you're a whale, with the way you're acting, I doubt you could even handle a job. You want everything nice and easy handed to you, but this is not how the world works. What's way more disgusting, is that you're actually happy that 140 people lost their job, which shows just how much of a basement dweller you really are.
---
&gt; But maybe, one day, we'll get that aura wardrobe via the novelty system and can convert it into an aura we can apply to any character.
---
You just know they'll find some way to fuck that part up and make it a "transformation", so you can have *either* one aura active, or be allowed to mount.
---
Says LilyLilley, apparently.
---
Don't take this person too seriously - they are a caricature out of r/iamverysmart
---
I really hope you are right about the second part.
---
Yep.  Jim's position is generally that microtransactions and etc are fine in F2P games so long as they add value to your experience and aren't predatory.
---
What would be more meaningful content though? Raids? Not meaningful to me. The idea that meaningful content has to equal difficult content is overblown. Scavenger hunts are meaningful content to some people, particularly if they're not using a guide. I find plenty of meaningful content in the game for my style of play. If it was just raids and new fractals coming out, it wouldn't have kept me in the game long term.
---
I don't think an mmo can ever survive either purely off hardcore or casuals. They both fill important roles in a community.
---
just buy another 20k with the gold from the infusion lol
---
The fact that they changed how meta participation works really disappoints me as someone who just came back after not having played since Dragon Stand was the hottest shit in the game (and I loved it)
---
Considering most dragons tend to move to hunt for rich magical locations, I imagine Zhaitan had little reason to wander off as well. Orr was rife with magic and magical artifacts, he sent out his undead to fetch a lot of them to bring back to him, and him lifting an entire subcontinent is no small feat for a newly awoken and still starving dragon.
---
Given his propensity to task minions with finding food for him, its likely that he would have just sent out a bigger task force if he didn't have to raise Orr, have them go looking for more magic sooner.
---
i was told we couldn't find evidence of the item being deleted.....i sent them screnshots.
---
(red poly reverb) riparoni
---
I'm guessing it's the messenger not the message. Criticism of GW2's use of gamble boxes is becoming more popular in the community, but Jim Sterling is a very divisive figure and a lot of people can't stand the guy.
---
&gt; Idc if people have a different opinion but his go to response was to tell people to go play another game, so yeah I'm going to call him out for being an idiot
---
Well he didn't say that, he said he hadn't seen someone expressing opinions like that.
---
&gt; If being called an idiot offends you, then you are too much of a snowflake.
---
If you're getting this mad at something that matters so little, someone who isn't even disagreeing with you, I've got news for you...
---
And given that the cave Ronan found the seeds in was shown to be an old Exalted outpost, its very probable that they were helping Forgotten run more tests on severing Dragons from their champions there, as they did with Glaust before that.
---
I'm also glad that someone else thinks the nightmare tower was another seed like the Pale Tree had come from. Marjory saying it felt alive is something most people just skimmed over, it bloody shuddered when she went to stab it!
---
Only made me that much more curious about any underlying connection between the dream/nightmare and Mordremoth though.
---
At least you realize you're dumb...most people would find some way to blame the game and the company instead of admitting they're dumb.
---
&gt; k with the gold from the infusion lol
---
I just sold it for 9988g, got 5.3k gold profit (3k gold for 10k coffers)
---
Its easy. just pick a female norn with long hairstyle and no tattoos.
---
To get abit more tanky you can go valk gear on reaper since you get alot of precision in traits
---
Oh yes, totally. Lws2 was a tad more in line with the season 1 style "changing" living world thought, compared to current content. E.g. Fort salma and prosperity getting attacked by vines and changing permanently. They could avoid such things thought obviously.
---
Yeah and on op's pic, maybe showing a number on the right side of each showing how many active posts are in each category
---
I really hope that‚Äôs not the case
---
&gt;All I want is a raid queue finder like in WoW. The current LFG system is pretty toxic and makes the content very hard to get into.
---
Indeed, maybe with a lower difficulty with lower reawards; I think it would really help getting people more familiar with raids.
---
I think you're taking a very narrow view of the community. For starters, when people are exploring whether they want to pick up a new game, they will almost inevitably turn to the hardcore players. Hardcore players are the ones who drive things like the wiki and other helpful resources. Having hardcore players who are really into your game tends to give the game a certain amount of prestige among other gamers (or maybe it's more accurate to say the reverse is true - gw2 has always suffered in the eyes of the gaming community as a whole because of the lack of offering to hardcore players at launch).
---
Which is easy enough to implement with keeping skins, titles, achievements and legendary armor collections exclusive to normal or more challenging. Allow for some gold, some exotics and some LIs in an easier mode and then you also introduce encouragement for progression - players have some LIs but need to do normal for legendary armor.
---
On the flip side, I do think this sudden concern about people only playing easy mode is pretty unsubstantiated. It doesn't seem to be a big concern with fractals and finding your own level of play isn't a bad thing. If more people are seeing the content, does it matter if only a few progress to normal and CMs?
---
I use carapace chest, sneakthief legs, panscopic monicoel, lucent vent, Spearmarshal‚Äôs boots, and one of the WvW gauntlets idk
---
Yeah there have been far too many times I've been pissed off or depressed and just bought a bunch of keys out of impulse, it's not fun to think about at all. Thankfully I only do it when I know for a fact it won't put my household in a tight spot but still...
---
Same. Balancing would be even worse and it wouldn't add much elite specs can't. When I play a class, I wanna play that class in a unique way, not as a watered down version of another class to stack as many damage modifiers as possible.
---
I find how microtransactions affects the game worse in the case of GW2, due to what Lon-ami pointed out.  
---
In GW2 the entire game is being built around farming gold to exchange for gems to buy things like mount skins. Unique gameplay rewards suffer tremendously as a result.  
---
In RS3 on the other hand, gameplay rewards are extremely strong with MTX having little impact on them.
---
I really don't get why they don't replace items that they can even check that you should have it. Had the same problem with the support before with an item they wouldn't replace and that you could exchange with no ask at all (hard mode tokens sab vs 16 baubels)
---
I've had this growing feeling of uneasiness lately, about guild wars 2.  I really enjoy a lot of the game, and I've played it for a very long time, while trying to keep my spending on it close to what it would have been had it been a subsciption based game.  
---
The sinking feeling though, is that at its core, it has become exploitative in its design.  I am part of the game industry myself as well, so this is both a professional and personal observation. These trends have just been steadily growing over the past decade.  
---
So the crisis: even though there are so many things that I love in the game, and professionally admire about the dev teams' accomplishments, can I continue, in good conscience, to support a game which I believe to be exploitative?  
---
I'm not sure, but it is getting harder and harder to convince myself that it is okay.
---
Guard transitions nice from dps to support. Dh-&gt;fb
---
Pikeneer here, so maybe a bit biased, but trying to be objective.
---
First of all, Kodash is getting hit hard by this. A couple of months ago they had good coverage and a nice prime time blob. At the moment they have neither. WSR even made their eb keep t3 this morning. No way Kodash can or should be a full server. Piken has more coverage, with some Oceanic/Aussi guilds, but come prime time we are heavily outnumberd, both in quality and quantity. 
---
Now the bandwagoners have left Piken, we're down to our community commanders, who are doing the best working with the material they've got. Since I don't play/tag during prime time that works entirely fine for me, I can play with my friends and fight other groups, win some, lose some. 
---
I do notice that locking servers and denying them a link makes it impossible for a lot of people to be unable to play with their friends or guildies. 'Transfer to another server', some say. That costs gold/gems and you have the risk your returning players get locked out when a bandwagon happens. Furthermore it disrupts the entire WvW population, causing shockwaves affecting all servers (prime example Vabbi going from t5 tot t1 to t5 again, creating bad matchups all over or RTK leaving BB for UW, making UW a strong off prime server and weakening BB, so one guild have a big effect).
---
My recommendations for Anet:
---
1. Make alliances your prime objective for WvW. We don't need a 'core swap' or whatever event. We need an overhaul to WvW server mechanics. 
---
2. Be transparent in the way you build up those alliances, like you should be (have been) transparent in the criteria for determining the server status. Ask feedback from communities and guilds. Of course certain groups will game those criteria, but you can always adjust. 
---
3. Having unlimited server transfers encouraged people/guilds to transfer often, resulting in bandwagoning. That's a nice money grab, but weakens the community building and results in players quitting sooner. If alliances are far off (and I guess they still are), you should consider to give the servers a temporary fix (if technically possible). 
---
4. And most of all... communicate. Locking the topic on the official forums... sigh... We all want a thriving WvW community (well I hope so) and for this we need to work together, players, Anet, communities, guilds, bandwagoners, ...
---
because 9 elite specs would be alot of content for one LW episode and not releasing them all at once will cause a shitshow of ppl complaining that their class has to wait 3-12 months till they get theirs
---
i think reading through the comments of this thread shows enough about who is the bully. Projecting much?
---
Soft CCs don't do anything to enemies with defiance bars besides slowly lower them when active. So things like weakness, blind, taunt, slow, chilled, etc. As for the magic spike attacks just walk out of them, block, dodge, or otherwise invuln them like other normal hits.
---
&gt;Josh Foreman said that before the layoffs people were barely working on gw2
---
where?
---
Damn that's worse than mine! Closest I've wiped on Dhuum is on 0.01%. Shit like this happening made me buy stat infusions.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I just sold it for 9988g, got 5.3k gold profit (3k
---
Well there you go, so what exactly is the problem?
---
For having played it for quite a while I find the Warframe model to not be too scummy by far especially considering the amount of content being put out but the grind can get pretty annoying on the long run for harder-to-loot items.
---
I don't want free things.  They've shown that it's perfectly possible for them to put armor skins (gloves, boots, helms, sometimes as sets) in the gemstore for set prices and not locked behind RNG boxes.
---
Ah s___, here we go again.
---
Don't worry, they'll fix this Soon‚Ñ¢ in approximately 8 months time.
---
Would prefer kodan over tengu any day.
---
I couldn't figure out how to browse.. there was just a huge list but no sorting..
---
You should be able to put search filters in.
---
For colour, race, sex, armour weight etc
---
Im sorry but this is quite a shallow way to describe things. I get that people who grind gold all day might miss out on other more intricate game modes and mechanics but if you look deeper its very similar. 
---
I used to farm silverwastes and i thought i could make 20g an hr pressing 1111 but the truth is you cant. If you want to make max gold you have to actually try hard at tagging events. Pressing 1 in the end is just a means to get to the goal of what youre doing. Min maxing more clever ways to make more efficient gold is the challenge people want to solve. Is that so braindead? Quite the opposite. I end up making like subpar gold cuz ironically all i did was press 1 and netflix. 
---
Same deal with raids perhaps. Youre solving the challenges of game mechanics and class mechanics to kill a boss. And youre rewarded with gold and items. Its just different ways people choose to solve challenges. 
---
How can i say hey you should stop thinking so hard about how to make more gold and just use gems but then i shouldn‚Äôt say hey you should stop thinking so hard about playing fractals and raids and just buy them.
---
Just split it with winrar to whatever size you want. It'll create multiple smaller archives.
---
I think discretize.eu has Quickbrand, Alacrigade and Boon Chrono listed as Hybrid builds. I think itbecause those builds sacrifice dps for a specific kind of group support and are thus a hybrid of dps and support.
---
Do we realy need a thread like this every 2h?
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think they said it would come after season 4. Not right after, I know it's only a small difference but the latter gives false hope.
---
We have no idea on the gap between the two seasons. Could be 3 to 4 months or could be ages.
---
&gt; But then again that was before 2012 and they also argued against split balance back then.
---
Though, they still do that. Not every skill is being split but more and more are getting there. You don't need every split skill but you need it when a skill has a very different effect in different game modes.
---
I don't really want other professions skills, I would want more of my own skills. That brings more variety to the profession itself while staying in its own context. Skills that give me more variety in what Role I can play in or niche applications.
---
The other option besides gw2style.com:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/GuildWarsDyeJob/

gw2style is basically dead with an MIA admin for years, no moderation and no fixes to many broken or missing skins.

Sadly GW2 lacks a lot of community sites that other MMOs have, such as the site you linked for FF14.

Awesome ! Gonna test it tonight with a guild

This happened even with full infusions! ;-;

GW2 is like the most alt-friendly game ever. Just because your favorite profession didn‚Äôt get their elite spec this episode doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt get the content that was released. You'd have to be a total crybaby to rant about not getting exactly what you want when you want it in an online game.
---
I really like it but makes me wonder if the upcoming new armor in the autumn will also be themed to look like these weapons, or if I would have to go out of my way to find a style to fit them in.
---
Is there any game that's *better* because of micro-transactions?
---
I'll look up the specific wording when I'm home. It was something along the lines "going directly from season 4 to 5" which could mean either.
---
You'd need the rewards from normal to be enough so that you can get 1/4th of that... And I don't think 1 green, maybe 1 rare and 25 silver are enough of a carrot on a stick to lure people in.
---
I'd rather see new guild events...
---
What a great time to not have internet for a month... yay
---
Not everyone who wants lootboxes around just wants them to "gamble".
---
I want them because they are astronomically cheaper. Lootboxes are cheap alternative to buying things directly. I'm not paying $20 for a mount skin, but I'll pay $4 for one.
---
Horizontally
---
Thats kind of the problem though. The rewards already suck. Why would people go through the crux of finding a raid team if the rewards were even worse. This game suffers from a shitty reward system more than anything else. Easy mode wont bring new raiders for long, since the time to reward ratio would be worse than all that afk leech content out there.
---
That advice has been cancer for decades already, enough with it. You'll only end up breaking things tweeking with that, only to win maybe 1% performance before Windows ends up freezing.
---
BLC Ticket weapons, the unique account bound weapon skins and gliders that usually find their way into the box every other update (EG, hydra staff, exalted shoulders and gloves.), season 1 memory boxes, and mount licenses to an extent.  While yes, a majority of the skins aren't gemstore RNG related, they've still been reliably adding more to the boxes.
---
There is roadmap. If they just follow this roadmap, it will be perfect. 
---
Expect more informations in august. I don't really know why people create so many threads with this exactly same questions now in the pause between releases.
---
I DID NAHHT
---
I know Anet stated years ago it was a good idea.  Someone with hand disabilities put in a request for it.  I never heard it mentioned again until this day.
---
Thank you for posting this :D
---
That would be nice.
---
Just to answer at the one's that complaints telling that Piken and Kodash are server FULL , according the statistics coming , we are at 22nd place and Kodash at the last. See link :  [https://wvwstats.com/leaderboard](https://wvwstats.com/leaderboard)  
---
Out of this, we do complain that we have guilds "broken" because we have players that before at least have been moving in the linked and now cannot join their teams. I do not believe this is fair.
---
Get anets dick out of your mouth you know fully well that reporting directly to anet means nothing happens.
---
Yes, you're right I was exaggerating a bit, I'm sorry. Of course there is way more thought behind it, when it comes to min-maxing a farm (which I don't think most people are doing though), but at the same time I just can't really get behind the idea, why you would rather dedicated so much time in the game just farming gold all the time instead of doing something else. Especially in GW2 that offers such a large variety of content to choose from. But I guess to each his own, as long as you're having fun with it.
---
I personally make enough gold just doing fractals, raids and flipping the trading post a little bit, but a few years ago I actually used gem to gold often, it just always seemed more appealing than farming all the time.
---
If a defined end like that isnt bad then Overwatch's isnt either...yet thats everyones biggest target outside EA. Despite the fact Overwatch has probably the best and most value for money loot boxes around.
---
who said though that they will not start with other side projects? just because 2 got canned doesnt automaticly mean they will only work on gw2 from now on.
---
Awesome job, thank you for the guide :D
---
It was never said the spell was a spell from Abaddon in gw1. So if that wasn't done. its not a retcon.
---
People are not forced to do raids in easy mode though. Their loss if 1/4 of the reward doesn't please them, and they still don't want to do normal mode.
---
&gt; SWTOR gave us a solo mode for their version of minidungeons/fractals with a jesusbot that basically tanks/dps/heals everything for you, just so you can get the story.
---
Not for all of them, sadly ...
---
It wouldn't matter to the devs if that ultra casual playerbase wasn't a pretty big segment of the playerbase. Six guys getting loud won't change development. One dev stated, I wish I could find the quote, how few people had ever been to the traits screen to select their traits. It was a much higher number that you'd suspect, by percentage of total players. I was blown away. It's a casual game, because the playerbase is largely casual, not because the devs caved. For all we know, that was the intended target audience.
---
You don't really get the whole "don't invest in things you can't sell" thing, do you?
---
There are not enough hardcore players to support the cost of more development time for Raids. It just isn't worth it.
---
That sounds right. 
---
But I read that as them that's just them saying no expanson 9wck between, which has been the norm for the past 3 living story.
---
I'm taking the pessimistic view that it's going be a long gap between them, but that gap will be filmed with festfals and little bits of stuff released here and there. Like some of the world boss and meta events we have seen. They suggested the same for wvw and PvP on the road map I think. So there is some filler.
---
I ne'd
---
Same, I want a guild hall that feels like an actual building/base for your guild, instead of random structures scattered around the map
---
&gt;If tear them apart means saying it should give less to no raid specific rewards then sure.
---
I myself have argued for "Story Mode" in raids in the past, while having been very explicit in stating that such a mode should be completely disconnected from the standard raid reward structure. Offering only the standard loot drops you'd get from killing any mob in the open world.
---
Despite making it very clear that the draw is the narrative content, there were still raiders frothing at the mouth at the mere suggestion.
---
&gt;On other hand casual ppl dislike the idea of hard content that rewards something because they feel left out and rant against it non stop.
---
No, this is a strawman. "Casuals" such as myself don't care about the rewards, because by and large we play this game for the narrative and exploration/immersive aspects.
---
What "we" do dislike however is when narrative content or "lore" if you will, is kept out of reach without a good reason.
---
Oh Etherio this starts to be a bit silly. But ok you dropped your "clueless" bomb so i guess that give me room to respond and I will apologuise if it comes off as a bit harsh. I don't keep track on you as a person. Frankly i don't care about you as a person. But here on reddit you are one of few who voice your opinion about WvW and because of this i usually know were you are because you express so in posts you wrie. 
---
When i did the last post i had yet not seen a post from you telling were you as a person are now. So i did not know if you moved yet and were which was also the reason to why i told you to correct me if i guessed wrong, because i did not have a clue about were you are. And then you blow the omg you have no clue! No shit i just said so...
---
The movments of players have already started and will go on for a while and also involve other guilds that did not move in quite a while but now moved due to the National server issue. Most of them end up on WSR or Aborstone but i also know that some plan to go somewhere else but are waiting for the others to finish their moves. 
---
Also i never ever ever said you transfer 24/7. And yet you try make a reee out of something that clearly only you stated.
---
Subcategories would make perfect sense yeah.
---
Duty roulette is what made me hate FFXIV though.
---
There is a relevant [GDC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2l2ZxNhCSg) on this subject matter.
---
no.
---
Yes yes yes, the amount of invisible Desmina walls or Deimos *everything* I've seen missed due to this is way too high.
---
its mostly bothersome in raids where important mechanics like those one shot walls or red circles arent event displayed because mesmer clones get priority over them.
---
and not really fixed, just something that kinda works but has other problems
---
Best in a long while, Thank you!
---
No, the game really does need better tutorialization and has needed it for years.
---
Expansion zones can be brutal, too. Like, many who just boost a character are likely to get their asses kicked. Hard. There should be a tutorial for those as well.
---
Yes please! And if they absolutely need to cull enemies, cull them by distance and rank.

Here is the release not stating that they made tears unblockable in normal mode to make it consistent with the challenge mode:  [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/37502/game-update-notes-april-24-2018](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/37502/game-update-notes-april-24-2018)

Reality: Getting banned for exploiting
---
MF only becomes relevant at 1000+
---
smart observation dude i dig it :)
---
You know why the game mode's playerbases hate eachother? It's Anet's fault, they bring out an update for living world and not for pvp/raids/fractals/wvw and the raiders/pvpers get angry. Do that a hundred times and well, you have a massive divide.
---
&gt; Mounts are the best example of this, it was a huge mistake not to balance mount skins evenly between the game and the gem store.
---
Kinda. It would have even been fine separating by "class". That is:
---
* The "motion mounts", the ones required to progress, their skins are earned ingame. That's Danger Chicken, Springer, Majestic Sea Flapflap, Angry Cat and Jackal. I'm torn on the Griffon.
---
* The "luxury" mounts, the Beetle and the Skyscale (and maybe the Griffon, see above) get their skins **only** from the gem store.
---
* That creates space for incredibly posh skins and also simple and nice skins in both parts, without one always winning out over the other.
---
Sure in PvE but try playing PvP/WvW..... You‚Äôll learn fast because that‚Äôs what the gw has always been about.
---
Personal growth or personal skills progression over in game progression.... 
---
Want to know if your rotation sucks? If your armor sucks? If you suck?!? Get to the PvP outpost and train on the battle NPC‚Äôs!
---
Install arc and learn to understand what‚Äôs happening with your build with respect to others... Are you doing optimal damage? Are you pre buffing your bursts? (Is your build even in synergy???) Things like this you learn very quickly playing PvP and you‚Äôll never learn it playing PvE.
---
So basically take yourself to be tested in the fire of battle (use arc dps as others have suggested and keep testing at the NPC‚Äôs... You don‚Äôt need to do stupid pve golems... Go to PvP and learn your own place (get in where you fit in and grow your skills from that point)
---
You will learn really quickly about armor, viable builds, skills chaining (for 1 shot burst builds) and tactical physical rotation (player spacial awareness) ‚ÄúBody awareness‚Äù which cannot be ignored because you survive a lot better when your aware of your surroundings (and when you strategically save those dodges or stunbreaks for when you need them instead of just button mash on cooldown.. you‚Äôll learn ‚Äúhow to play‚Äù and here is why you Do ‚Äúthis‚Äù to counter ‚Äúthat‚Äù)
---
So yeah PvE is easy mode and nope you won‚Äôt be forced to progress with your skills or your knowledge of the game itself.
---
Play PvP and you‚Äôll know quick where your faults lie (ignore the salty and focus on your own personal development as a player and you‚Äôll be just fine.. PvP is surprisingly good and fun once you can hold your own)
---
&gt; omeone made a comment that there's a lack of meaningful content. In the past, I've always seen that referred to as difficult content, and that's what I was responding to.
---
So you made a baseless assumption. Read the comment you responded to, there is nothing to suggest he is talking about raids. You just built a strawman for yourself right there.
---
&gt;I posed that there is plenty of meaningful content in the game for my play style, something I'm an authority on. I never claimed to be an authority on yours, or any other person's play style.
---
And they said there isn't for them. Your answer "well there is for me." Cool. That's not an argument against what they said and you proposing it as such makes you look exactly like you claim authority over what one considers "meaningful content". 
---
So, to sum up, WvW has not seen meaningful updates in years, PvP is half dead, raids and fractals are unsustainable and even living world maps and episodes are generally criticized for not offering anywhere near enough to keep you occupied for anywhere close to 3 months. And this rather large, rather important (IMO at least) discussion you boiled down to "raids aren't meaningful to me". I can't help but take issue with that.
---
As for SAB, I didn't say that, Josh Foreman did. You know, the guy that made SAB. I think he knows what he's talking about.
---
I hope we will not have to wait until one week before release until we get new information.
---
I'm still waiting for story mode D: Without that, the only way I will experience raids is youtube videos.
---
Winning attitude on display (final line above)... Get this man some upvotes
---
Incredible how much of a patronizing asshole you are while completely missing the point of the discussion you joined. Let alone your pathetic elitism bullshit about being hardcore. You really are desperate to feel special, aren't you?
---
&gt; Yes i too know how to use gw2e
---
Is that why you ignored my argument completely? or is it because you simply have no answer whatsoever?
---
Your whole position boils down to a mystic raiding elite that will totally come to GW2 for Raids if only ANet starts catering to them. With you obvisously being a shining star among them.
---
Even GW1 went in that direction with the NPC heroes in Nightfall and Eye of the North.
---
The best way to not feeling squishy anymore would be to play some other classes. Play ele or thief in HoT. After that you will feel like reaper is a bunker class like scrapper.
---
Cutscenes only appear after the last boss was killed. Who cares if you watch them?
---
I love these hot takes that generalize everything and always put the blame on players as if the developer can never be wrong and makes the right decision every single time.
---
Reminds me some CMs where Saul clones conveniently stripped the whole group right before mind crush. Fun times.
---
AS i have already said you can dodge the explosions. Also you can clear the greeds if you want to. It is 100% reliable. Obviously it isn't press one button and then you are fine, but that's exactly what mechanics should be.
---
It is just a matter of training to not get the aegis stripped.
---
yeah, the added rng doesn't really add much in terms of fun fight. ultimately, nowadays you just run with a healscourge and precast well and F4 and everyone's up whether or not they keep their aegis.
---
Just do vb Meta and get exotic gear
---
Druid is kinda bad in fractals anyway and asc on a healer is otherwise wasted
---
&gt;You quickly run into a different problem there though. You make less money.
---
That's ANet's problem, not the problem of vulnerable people. ANet have options, including moving to a subscription-based model, or making more things available for purchase directly. The latter can work, because what you're doing is encouraging people to make microtransactions who don't want to gamble but will spend $5 (or whatever) on a weapon skin. I.e. you seek to get more people making small transactions, rather than looking to exploit a smaller number of people into spending hundreds or thousands of dollars a year.
---
Or, if Guild Wars 2 is making a lot of money now but other NCSoft games aren't, NCSoft should be dumping those loss-making enterprises rather than doubling down and throwing good money after bad.
---
&gt;And players move on to games that offer more, because they can still afford the larger development team. With their lootboxes.
---
Well at the moment Guild Wars 2 is offering nothing new. Waiting for Living Season 5, no news on another expansion. Just a festival that was fun for a few minutes and is now just about grinding out stuff for gold. It's not like there's a glut of content and people don't have enough time on their hands to play it all.
---
Anyway, as I said above, if ANet need money they have other ways of getting it. They chose to give away the base game for free rather than lower the price to like $10 or $5. "Everyone else is doing it" doesn't make it right. If ANet changed their income methods and it led to slightly slower development speeds, I'd hope the community would reward them for doing the right thing. Besides, where are people going to go? GW2 is one the less grindy MMORPGs.
---
&gt;But I think all players then have to realize, that games won't just become cheaper.
---
So many games companies are rolling in cash. They don't need lootboxes to survive, it's about maximising shareholder profits, not least because they keep promising more. Normal companies don't keep promising unrealistic returns. If ANet/NCSoft can only survive by exploiting vulnerable people, they deserve to go out of business. And yes, that would obviously mean GW2 would end. But how can you justify the right to enjoy a game that only exists because of exploitation? Would you play GW2 if it was programmed by North Koreans who were routinely abused and tortured because they missed dealines?
---
greed spawns are random, sauls position is not fully controllable, dodges will only keep you inside of a precog if you dodge from one edge to the other.
---
if that's what you call reliable mechanics, than good for you. 
---
I guess I'll just stick to the only truly reliable strategy that actually works unlike your fictional scenario: precast well of blood and F4.
---
You mean because of the second part in my comment? That's simply the way it is. And exactly why this discussion exists. because a large fraction of Raiders vehemently opposes any attempt to get more people into Raiding. Because they just don't want to accept, that creating content exclusively catered to a tiny fraction of players is not feasable.
---
More content barely anyone plays is simple not possible.
---
If you want more frequent Raids and hardmodes, you first need more people in Raids overall. And currently the only realistic option there is making them easier with still attractive rewards.
---
As long as it's not CM you can run pretty much every composition in T4 plus having a Chrono allows a lot of skips (stealth blink portal). Also aiming for harrier is probably a good idea if he wants to start raiding later.
---
Gw2efficiency can tell you the price of the craft or each stat, you can compare it by adding the rice of the conversion (the inscriptions' prices are also available)
---
Just ask to expedite the matter with a senior GM. Lesser GMs don't have access to all the tools seniors do, and I don't believe they're allowed to recommend senior GMs due to fears that it'll bog down the seniors with things that the player could otherwise just say "oh. okay" to and continue playing the game. It sounds stupid- and even a bit dickish, but it's entirely logical. 
---
I don't envy support.
---
In order to pull this off, you need to do the beetle race before hand.  For some reason after doing the beetle race, Dragon Launch gives you more travel distance in the air with it.
---
Good job showing simple figures of completition rates.
---
However I wanna talk about the style you used. You need to tone it down by a lot if you use text as a medium. This is just a few hints and not meant to be personal against your skill. If you do not want this, feel free to disregard this comment
---
You used a stylized font which already takes the readers attention to effortless read. You combined that with a rather complex background. That could either use more opacity or a more neutral background. Also the background uses a logo with font with the same font you used in your statistic. That could lead to initial confusion when opening the sheet.
---
Use less colors and probably only use colors to drive a statistic home. Here it is to compare completition rate so color the rates on both sides with the same color and leave the rest neutral.
---
The font is complex as it is, you might not wanna use layer effects like shadows (in or outside), glow or embossing. Outlines are fine if you wanna use a certain background and you wanna have the text stand out. Also the blue text has an overlay effect or a gradient which could be confusing too.
---
I can‚Äôt even start raiding until I get my ascended armor and 600 AR so I don‚Äôt get yelled at.
---
It also culls NPCs and raid mechanics. All the visual culling options - or lack thereof - need a solid looking over to be honest. Both the visuals and the gameplay are suffering harder each year.
---
I expect it'd be an unnecessarily gargantuan task by this point though, given that there's likely no rigid classification of which models/effects/gear etc constitute what level of importance.
---
how about this one https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Warrior_-_Power_Bannerslave_(Fractal)
---
Easy rotation and every fractal or raid group needs one. For raids condi is sometimes prefered and for power you need more precision in a raid than in fractals.
---
If we are talking about normal mode you can simply go in the bubble ^^ and in CM the Saul position is controlable. Also once you got aegis from the precog you don't need to stay in it.
---
&gt; Indeed, maybe with a lower difficulty with lower rewards; I think it would really help getting people more familiar with raids.
---
Totally agree.
---
This is currently a gate between me and legendary armor. If there was a lower difficulty, to say, put them on par with normal fractals, but w/lower rewards, I could progress towards them, even in a lower pace.
---
I always run with model limit on lowest,  and dont have this problem in raids.
---
The things that work against blues are Distort, Invul, Dodges and any kind of Block. Be careful that if you have an Aegis on you but are stepping on 2 blues at the same time (which is not unusual if people are stacked close together) you will block one of the but will be ported by the other.
---
Your best utility against the Blue teleport if you are not confident you will be able to avoid being ported most of the time would be the Sand Portal to help you quickly come back to the boss.
---
As already mentioned, Epi is still a very useful skill as it can help control  the Seekers: Cripple, Chill and Immob work on them and VG will probably have at least Cripple or Chill (and a Chilled Seeker will take a lot more time to reach you).
---
Model and effect loading needs to be prioritized better in general, perhaps more like ESO, which by default disables the loading of most player effects. 
---
The only time I should be seeing a player's fancy armor is if A) the enemy effects have been loaded, and B) the enemy itself has been loaded, and C) relevant player effects have been loaded (ie like blood well or renegade's warband effects. The latter is because these are important buffs, of course.
---
Why do top tier raid groups like this get unnoticed?
---
[https://www.twitch.tv/jeon\_so\_yeon](https://www.twitch.tv/jeon_so_yeon)
---
Holosmith (no kit sword rifle on metabattle) was my first raid toon, simple rotation and solid damage. You will not be top unless you are with a low LI group or trainees but overall it is a consistent class that fits with most pugs. Dragonhunter is also a good option and can top the dps meter aswell. I do recommend engineer though as it has more health pool thus less room to panic and offers a few neat group utilities. 
---
Warrior is also a solid option aswell as power berserkers are in the meta now. Banner will always be welcomed to a group. Necromancer is somewhat shunned by groups because of low dps but a good power reaper can easily keep up with group for dps and has some really sweet utilities and CC ( pull mobs etc. ) 
---
Both are viable for fracs and raids. For pvp its matter of knowing all the classes and reacting to their moves so any class that suits your style is what i recommend. If you like teamfighting then necro , holo( can also do good in 1v1) are good choices
---
No way around harrier in raids
---
But firebrand and rev are better as soon as you know in wich order to press your buttons.
---
I dont think its as simple as that, of course new content causes the player numbers to spike up, but I dont think its guaranteed to keep the people there
---
Since the rework of sword of justice you can cast it in range and use merciful to port on its location 
---
White mantle Portal takes care of the rest of the party
---
I like how you slam FFXIV but give ESO a pass even though they're basically the same.
---
Number 1 reason why stopped playing regularly. The only thing I ever felt accomplishment for was getting the legendary pvp backpack the first season. Everything else is either farmed with gold or bought through the store.
---
The biggest addictions in this world is shopping and food but it is "normal" because there are thousands of shops everywhere in retail and online. I can guarantee there are hundreds of millions more people in debt and overweight due to shopping addictions and impulse buying. Gaming is just heavily targeted and blamed because it has a disproportionate amount of children playing them and boomers don't play games so they blame them saying they must be evil.
---
Yes lootboxes and gambling mechanics are predatory but the entire world we live in is designed to extract money from us any way possible. People have a choice, and being able to use that decision on what you spend your money on is freedom. Taking that freedom away by government regulation who likely has no idea how games work or the level of blanket banning it will do to "protect the children" will have severe consequences in gaming and the industry. 
---
Money has to come from somewhere for development, and we will be seeing games cost $100+ and all expansions will be required to be payed, rather than the cost covered by microtransactions.
---
Warrior, Dragon Hunter, and Reaper are all good choices.
---
Warrior is easy and has banners. A core part of any meta comp. Used to be my go to in Fractals.
---
Dragon Hunter is on the easy side and has crazy burst and good survivability. Fractals are pretty much designed around DHs skill set.
---
Reaper a lot of people will disagree with because it's not the best class to speed run with, but I highly doubt you're going to be about that speed run life when just starting out. Reaper is my favorite for pretty much any content involving PUGs, and as such I have more to say about it than the others. Reaper is basically the best class in the game when you have to worry about team mates. You generally have to rely on people less with it. You have crazy sustain, if you get knocked down you are hard to kill, you have great burst, great AoE, you generate a lot of the boons you depend on, you debuff the enemy, overall still do good damage, and it's rotation is stupid easy to master. The worse your group is, the better Reaper is. Now, if you end up in a great static with 4 other people who are good at what they are doing, Reaper stops shining as much, but it's always great for when shit starts to go a little south, and still is a good choice for AoE and burst damage, which Fractals are all about.
---
Fractals overall aren't super hard. Early on basically anything at all works in them. Once you hit T4s, stuff does get harder, but it's not exactly hard. As long as team composition makes sense, a lot of comps will work. Squishy classes will find fractals a little harder since certain instabilities can end up having you take big damage, but even still squishy classes will work in T4s.
---
If you need a suggestion, one of the three I listed will be a safe bet, but if there is a power class you are enjoying now, that will probably be just fine as long as you use a proper build for it. Being good at the class you play is usually better than just playing what's "best". Fucking around in my raid group with a Condi thief and hitting top DPS with it is proof enough of that.
---
Lootboxes or not, to this day I'd still rather spend money on skins and colours on Warframe than QoL stuff (bank/inventory tabs, character slots, maybe gathering tools) on GW2.
---
I think what they mean is updates have to be regular. Pushing a huge update every 2+ years isn't going to keep people engaged.
---
I hated this collection before I even got there and was dreading it...but having just got my first batch (250 difluorite crystals), I'm starting to like it I think?
---
I think this might be because every time a new episode came out, I played the story, did map completion and then left it after doing 1 or 2 event meta runs. But now I'm experiencing them all properly and seeing the new life that's been breathed into them, and I have to say I'm enjoying it!
---
The ability to guy in game gold directly with cash is arguably p2w.
---
Not at all.
---
If it was like that they'd make the taken skills the skills the enemy had to test interactions with 2 skill sets, instead they give 1 fixed build per profession regardless of what the enemy defeated had equipped, showing they are trying to keep things under control rather get information on what people would do if they had 2 professions.
---
play with 6 mesmers in the group and 18 clones up and you will have those problems on matthias and desmina, i promise you.
---
Holy Cow! That shield looks so classy, it beats the legendary and TPbaron shields imo.
---
&gt;that means majority of the living story playerbase have at least attempted or even cleared a raid encounter.
---
Be careful with your interpretation. Does the site deliver stats on the whole playerbase, or just of those players who chose to opt-in?
---
If the latter is the case, then your data will probably have a huge bias. I'd argue that very engaged players (ie players who would visit such a fan site) are much more likely to do raids, while an average, less engaged player (who has most likely never even heard of that site) tends more towards living world activities. Without further knowledge about that base population it is nigh impossible to account for that bias.
---
It is of course fair to use such data (even in the presence of a bias) to study tends, eg how these numbers compare to the same, biased numbers from, say, a year ago.
---
Why should microtransactions bail out bad publishers?
---
If they want money, offer a good product people are willing to pay for and turn a profit on that. If you consistently have a massive team with large costs which turn out almost no content; then perhaps you shouldn't be profitable. 
---
People will go all REEEEE and say things aren't possible; yet anet managed to increase their communication and content output while decreasing their team size vastly. Turns out it was possible all along.
---
Yea, the same thing also happen to me. I got 2 dragon shirt tonic codes from early party and somehow got both of the tonics turned into an outfit when they rerelease the outfit. Support wont replace the tonic and now i got 1 outfit and 2 consumable outfits (new one from that scamtea event) that i just lay it on my bank.
---
For solo, rune of ice is nice for the 100% chill uptime and bonus damage on chilled foes (15% from trait + 7% from rune).
---
Blending raid with open world is a nice way for people to learn boss mechanics before going into the actual raid.
---
It shows the serious raiding community is probably a small percentage of the total playerbase.
---
Except that anet has never proposed easy mode for raids that's always been a bad idea only proposed by players
---
first of all, don't go warrior because you'll be delegated some mechanics so it will make your learning process harder(dhuum greens, anomalies and ball in fractals, general cc-ing etc.)
---
since other supports usually have even more mechanics, the option remains to go dps!
---
as others said, dragonhunter is a beast and you can play it almost anywhere! some raid fights do require condi damage so having a mirage to fall back on helps a lot
---
both those specs are not only meta but due to design can afk through a lot of stuff!
---
if for whatever reason they don't suit you, here are some honorable mentions(easy to play): power daredevil, condi scourge, condi shortbow soulbeast, power holosmith, power tempest
---
should you want to attempt healing, you can't really go wrong with druid! however, you'll have to do many mechanics and some of those you **might** find quite annoying(pushing golems at desmina, kiting golems at dhuum)
---
heal tempest is also very strong right now and comes in 2 flavors: healbot afk mode with staff and boon stacker with dagger/warhorn
---
for tanking the only option will probablty be chrono as pugs are quite adverse to change..plus despite all the changes it's still one of the best/safest tanking options!
---
WvW had a pretty big audience that wanted to play that content. Yet anet's changes and steps were repeatedly aimed towards making it more appealing to the casual group rather than improvements for its audience. 
---
They didn't make improvements for its audience. They made improvements to draw in more players that literally \[don't like WvW but may like it if it was more like open world\]. They've done this consistently and it failed time and time again. 
---
Consequently a HUGE part of the WvW audience left. And a tiny fraction was replaced by players they made the gamemode more appealing for. Meanwhile the casual part of the game repeatedly uses this as an argument why WvW should never get any development at all; and if it gets development it should go further their way. Obviously the WvW audience vehemently opposes every step in that direction as anet alienates their own audience due to sheer incompetence. There's a reason we're stuck with 5 dead tiers compared to 9 pretty active ones (EU); and it's not because anet made sufficient improvements to the gamemode. 
---
I'll give PvP as an example. PvP lower tiers are abused by AFKs and BOTs to farm a legendary backpack; ascended gear and gold. Anyone less skilled to be unfortunate enough to end up in these tiers consistently has to deal with these AFKs and bots and it turns the whole experience sour quickly. Did drawing more people into "their" area improve the experience for the audience that was playing? Nope. It was suddenly vastly worse.
---
So it is suprising that these players eventually become bitter towards anet and other players who play just for rewards in spite of them? Not really. Anet sees player numbers spike up with an influx of new players happy to try out the gamemode for new rewards, as well as plenty people plain afking for them. They consider their updates to be succesful without proper evaluation to player retention, enjoyment, feedback. The issues that arise are ignored for years and eventually fed up players leave. As players leave, the existing problems only become more pronounced. Result? A lot of thrown away development efforts due to sheer incompetence. 
---
"Drawing in players = good?!?!" is as dumb as saying clickbait titles are amazing because they generate more clicks when your audience wants insightful articles. I'm sure initially you'll have your loyal fanbase AND plenty of clicks generated by the clickbait. But eventually you're associated with cheap clickbait and your fanbase leaves. Then you better hope clickbait alone is good enough to keep things going. 
---
I'll be happily awaiting players who barely WvW point out to how desert bl wasn't happily received despite being an amazing super pretty map with no flaws, how golem week was a huge success, portable cannons should have been added to the game and PoF meta is the best WvW meta we've had since culling blobs.
---
I like most of what you have suggested. 
---
&gt; a guild call that sends off a pingike 
---
This one though can be accomplished with Guild Chat and linking a Waypoint or Poi.
---
No, but GW2 was made intentionally worse and more frustrating to play because they wanted to monetize that aspect. Bank tabs, inventory tabs, salvage kits, mount's ability of being dyed, etc etc. They strip the game down and sell the clothes to you, it's bad IMO.
---
Just because other things have it worse it doesn't mean we cannot or should not criticize the bad things we currently have.  
---
Specially when so many people are quitting because of a lack of rewards in the game (and content in general), since most things go on the gemstore, leaving us long-time players sucking on our thumbs.
---
Sorry Duca but did you really never heard a piken commander say: "we can't fight them", "don't give them bags", "port out", "move map"....?
---
That happens mostly when we don't have numbers yeah but also when we can't win a fight cause enemies are too strong.
---
&gt; People will go all REEEEE and say things aren't possible; yet anet managed to increase their communication and content output while decreasing their team size vastly. Turns out it was possible all along.
---
Well, since that simply isn't true. At all. Yes, it is impossible to just increase output without also increasing your cost.
---
ANet closed down several projects. That's why they let people go. They drastically reduced their output and focused solely on GW2. Which it seems benefited from that.
---
But that doesn't mean they can now magically cut revenue and still produce the same amount of content for less money.
---
Seriously, where do people get these ridiculous ideas?
---
I don't generally have much issue with your other points, but during the meta you can waypoint to the shrines even in combat. So if you are stuck in combat, just use a nearby shrine and fly back to the meta below.
---
posting gamebreaking bugs on reddit gets shit fixed fast.
---
Exactly, a lot of people wouldn't want a sub fee. WoW and FFXIV, the two largest MMOS out there are the only ones that managed to establish themselves with a subscription fee.
---
All the other ones, some larger, some smaller then GW2 failed with that. Several shut own completely. And a few survived by switching to free to play.
---
What are some of the recommended long range open world build?
---
Take a look at why **literally** the devs in WoW say that LFR is a mistake.
---
I like Lily to get me close to the desert quicker and cheaper. It's like a better version of Lions Arch for the desert.
---
Buy karmic retribution from the vender (they stack if you buy two or three), get tons of karma just from killing mobs. Consume the mistborn motes for ~20 VM each.
---
ANet has an irrational fear of trees that are more than 1 layer deep. Achievement categories is another testament to that.
---
Imagine you click around and noticed 'Malnourished' on one of your dudes' status bar. \*Surprised pikachu'
---
Definitely been there before, the upset was real
---
The ~~ultra-casual~~ playerbase ~~held the developers hostage with outrage, shitstorms, brigading~~ provided feedback on social media, ~~threats to stop spending money etc~~ until Anet ~~caved in~~  made changes to appeal to a larger player base. Development and direction of the game isn't anymore driven by the visions of the developers but by ~~the demands of the loudest crybabies~~  what can be sold profitably because ANET is a business after all. ~~Because Anet is too much of a pussy to upset the precious snowflakes.~~
---
~~Remember when they dared to give 10 achievement points to the top player of the PvP leaderboard? Or to post Raid builds on facebook? Can't have that in "our" casual game d'oh.~~
---
Kitty just couldn't help but post that. Since Meep is such a goth moa with spiky neck- and anklebands and stuff, Kitty took a screenshot from good angle and used threshold filter and the result was just dark and kewl.
---
A good chunk of the raiding population doesn‚Äôt care for living world stuff at all. Especially now that the raiding scene is dying down, a ton of people play the bare minimum to keep raiding once a week, or like me they came back for wing 7 and then went back to other games.
---
Right? It would be a really cool set. Could even have salt fall off when you swing the weapon, it'd be perfect.
---
I don't see why we can't. It would save so much clicking at Wintersday and space in my bags.
---
No. I'm mad at anet for not giving us updates. 
---
I'm mad at this toxic playerbase for every single WvW or PvP thread, no matter how constructive, being "controversial" on downvotes and riddled with players going "WvW doesn't even like all the updates they get so they don't deserve any!" and and the likes.
---
Or how every raid thread has tons of "YEAH RAIDERS ONLY HAVE THEMSELVES TO BLAME BECAUSE HOW DARE YOU ASK LI OR KP OR A META BUILD!!!!" Extra funny cause those very same people will go "in gw2 you can play however you like". Well unless you ask for a meta build then clearly you're not part of the friendly community and should GTFO. 
---
Or how every PvP thread, constructive, feedback, honestly any thread, has to have a "remember when anet did esports omegalul" along with "let pvp die already" and "the playerbase so toxic they should remove it". 
---
How "this game was always designed for casuals", "PvP and WvW were an afterthought and never real gamemodes" and "raids shouldn't even exist". How loyal, hardcore players should just "go play another game" because "this game isn't for them". Yet still telling themselves they're the "friendliest playerbase". 
---
I'm sorry but the playerbase has made it repeatedly very clear that anything not super casual, off meta isn't welcome. They have done this towards a lot of minority groups including raids, wvw and PvP and continue to do this. In an actually friendly game, you'd see them support the wishes of other playstyles without interfering but they cannot and will not. It's most certainly the players responsible for this massive divide.
---
That's just people who only see the negatives. Every modern MMORPG with raids has some kind of difficulty scaling. Can this be implemented wrong? Absolutely. That's why raiders are afraid of the change because A-Net has fucked up modifying content a bit too many times. If they can introduce these modes, be it "easy" and "hard" they should come with some kinds of incentives to do one or the other. Since gear progression doesn't exist to the extend of the majority of RPG games we have to see something that both doesn't alienate in-between difficulties and doesn't promote playing only one of each forever. ArenaNet themselves have explained their concern with this as seen in CMs and their lack thereof in the newest fractals. Not to mention the LFG system that's laughably inconvenient to use and the neglect on the guild system which only seems to serve as a tool for easy banner crafting now don't help the situation much.
---
Cries harder.
---
&gt; World of Warcraft was massively profitable through subscription-based revenue.
---
And a myriad of smaller competitors failed spectacularly trying to get a subscription model to work. Nearly all switched to free to play quickly. And most failed completely.
---
&gt; No, it's to remove the gambling microtransactions and replace them with the ability to buy stuff for a straight-up, visible price.
---
Yes, that's still Microtransactions.
---
&gt; Then there's no need to run GW2 as a cash-cow. It can just be a fun game that makes a small amount of profit.
---
Sure. And you will finance it?
---
Seriously, you are aware how businesses work, are you?
---
&gt; No, I'm pointing out that the current method of getting revenue isn't keeping players busy with fun new stuff. It's probably down to executives deciding they want more profit, so they take away resources from development. You know how games companies keep firing staff despite making ever more money? Wouldn't surprise me if the same is happening with ANet.
---
Again, do you have any idea how businesses work? Because it seems you believe that they are charities run for the benefit of consumers. Financed by wishful thinking and fairy dust.
---
&gt; The point is that people would - one hopes - draw the line somewhere. And exploiting vulnerable people is highly unethical.
---
When you want to talk about drawing a line, maybe don't compare selling a product to torturing people? Doesn't really make for a good argument. And while I would agree, that regulating loot boxes is a good thing. They are in no way the depth of depravity you want to make them out as.
---
&gt; Besides, the big studios have so much money they don't need new investors to make games.
---
Again, how the hell do you think the world works? Seriously?
---
You can make fun little Indie games. Yes. And maybe you are happy with just those. Good for you. Just limit yourself to those Indie games and live a happy life.
---
&gt; Don't hint at new content and exploit people for the money to make it.
---
Again, you are free to fucking leave. Seriously. People bitch and whine when they don't talk about future content. And then bitch and whine because they talk about future content. If you don't like a product. Don't buy it. It's that simple. But don't invent bullshit reasons why companies offering something is somehow evil and akin to torturing people.
---
&gt;Of course there will be flaws in these stats, any stats not given by ANet will have some assumptions in them, as [gw2efficiency.com](https://gw2efficiency.com/) does not represent the entire playerbase.
---
Sorry for not being clear enough in the above sentence then. 
---
Unfortunately I cannot access ANet's database for more accurate stats.
---
&gt; A casual singleplayer open world game?  
---
Yes that is 100% the focus. Everything else has been neglected in spite of this.
---
Just to make a stand. I play about 12 hours a week due to work. Pretty casual, 13k achievement points however. I havent finished PoF or a raid but do T4 Fractals. My problem is I am an altoholic. I use gw2efficiency for my collections and ability to easily review crafting, etc. So I am one of those kddities that still plays but have neither of the 2 things mentioned done.
---
Best moa &lt;3
---
Yes, I am sure WoW would have retained a lot more players if more content was gated behind the furstrating hassle of organising 40 people on the same night and all the drama that accompanied it.
---
/s
---
I'd say that's because ANet has no plans for more Raid content. The Raids we have and the current schedule for new ones seems to be enough for their purposes.
---
Do you have a link to that study?
---
&gt; Kitty just couldn't help but post that. Since Meep is such a goth moa with spiky neck- and anklebands and stuff, Kitty took a screenshot from good angle and used threshold filter and the result was just ~~dark and kewl~~ the most low effort post of today.
---
Fixed it for you ^^
---
Sign ups? Rosters? Is there a designated PVP lobby? EU/NA? (I guess EU from the timezone but its an assumption) Where does the entry go to? You? Who R U?
---
Theres lots of informations missing
---
And then raid seller came along and ruined everything. Sadly now that we think about it, that completely destroyed PvEs' motivations to learn raiding. All these 'Discounted legendary armors!' posts are just aggravating.
---
You can do it once per day (maybe per character). Are you sure you didn't get it even the first time?
---
There used to be a much larger audience for GW2 streams because we had a more hardcore playerbase. After years of neglect both the playerbase and the streamers are long gone. 
---
GW2 used to have 1000-2000 viewers for player hosted GvG tournaments (WvW) quite regularly. Also WvW pugs streaming had pretty reasonable viewer counts, 10-100 times more than they get now. Anyone remember people like chemsorly? Yet even these people were very quick to jump ship to other MMORPGs because it was clear; even this many year ago, that anet had no competence in developing for them. 
---
Likewise helseth, sind and ROM would, many years later, often get 500-1k viewer peaks. Yet even those all left, and moved on to other games. Some come back occasionally, but as always viewer numbers only decline. 
---
Most gaming magazines didn't report when PoF got released because our hardcore population was already bullied out of the game for the most part. WvW and PvP neglected; raids only added YEARS after the game released and at a pace so slow and a difficulty so low it doesn't retain hardcore players. Of course nobody watches, the only people that still play only press 1 and F or roll their hand over all their buttons whenever something is off CD.
---
READ the post.... I did NOT get anything and I did it on two SEPARATE days. No reward both times.
---
&gt; WvW had a pretty big audience that wanted to play that content. Yet anet's changes and steps were repeatedly aimed towards making it more appealing to the casual group rather than improvements for its audience.
---
Do you have a source for this? Because literally everything else I have seen on the topic has shown, that the WvW players are absolutely dwarved by the PvE players. And that goes right from the beginning. PvErs might come by from time to time. And that's a reason to not let WvW die completely. But that's about it.
---
Which is exactly why they aimed the changes at their audience. The overwhelmingly casual PvE audience.
---
PvP is even less popular.
---
And yes, your post is exactly what I mean. You want your "hardcore" WvW experience. Which is fine. But that also means, that it simply isn't worth it to invest large resources into the gamemode. Because it's not what brings the majority of players into the game. New PvE content is the driving force there. So of course, that's what they spend the most time on.
---
The only way to change that is to significantly raise player numbers in WvW. Which can't happen as long as WvW has such a small community.
---
Ain‚Äôt the chest in the backroom with wall that disappears?
---
It's hard for me to differentiate which aoe is enemy or ally just like you describe.  Before I created multiple characters with different classes, I had no idea what their aoe skills looked like so I dodged/avoided all aoe animations just in case. And inadvertently dodged helpful wells/boons as a result. I didn't even know guardian traps were from guardians for the longest time. It shouldn't be this way.
---
But that‚Äôs due to laziness. And when you gear a fb you can just respec to dps dh if the party comp demands it.
---
Yeah it sucks. They need to fix it. Just make sure your in tangled depths when you want to do the meta. I struggled also :/
---
You need all 4 lanes to do it and loot chest near waypoint. Chest will be there only few minutes. Try to join right map BEFORE event starts to avoid failing event.
---
I haven‚Äôt touched my griffon in ages. I took my time getting my skyscale due to thinking my griffon was amazing. Oh boy was I wrong.
---
200-250 is still too much. I've bought HoMM3 like 17 years ago for like 10 bucks and still play it from time to time, it doesn't mean that I'm cheap or I'm ripping someone off. Its fine to play gw2 without buying gems.
---
I've spend my share on gem store as well but I've done it just because I wanted to support the company. When PoF launched I've dropped like a 100$ (+expac) even tho most gemstore items were garbage at the time (yes, I do have forged outfit). But guess what? I didn't buy a single gem since Hall of Chains release and I'm perfectly fine with this.
---
Thinking that you're ripping off multibillion dollar company because you don't buy something they suggest you to buy is ridiculous. That's why I've been always making fun of people who are saying that LS is 'new free content'.
---
Tempest can provide full fury and might for 10 in about 2,5 seconds by using all shouts and Heat Sync while druid takes that 2,5 seconds just to get fury started and might to 16ish stacks. And if you use scepter, as tempest, you can then blast Dragon's Tooth and Phoenix on Wildfire to get longer-term might going and expand with Sand Squall.
---
In power comp druid has the edge of Spotter (if needed by certain classes) and Frost Spirit but in condisome comps druid doesn't really have any noticeable differences from sc+wh tempest. Sun Spirit does add some burn but not super-much.
---
I've been meaning to turn my ele into a healslave, do you happen to have a guide/link for the afkmode staff healer?
---
Yes. Difference is that a raid needs to be "well made", balanced and have a high replay value. Hardcoreplayers will repeat them again and again. More casual players tend to repeat content less often, so they need more content. But it can be lower quality content, because it does not need to be super challenging, does not need a high replay value.
---
Also: most hardcore players, raid players etc. also do easier content. Maybe not daily fractals, but they play fractals from time to time. Or dungeons. So they can play fractals AND raids. Casuals are stuck with only fractals.
---
It's not flexing when everyone has the same legandary.
---
Chrono is also nice in just about every other fractal for the power of focus pull + Gravity Well, with the added benefit of Focus pull being on an effective 10 seconds cooldown as opposed to 18 seconds, without trait.
---
Music is terrible :(
---
Once, a long time ago, I got a raid boss kill by singing for a guild who was taking singing for them as payment for a boss kill. I show as having a boss kill, for a boss I never actually killed myself. With all the raid sellers, I'm not sure how many of the people who have raid kills are actually raiders.
---
I have done the escort quite a few times with my guild, just to get people to get that mastery track unlocked, back in the days when you needed to do that to get spirit shards in HoT.   But that's pretty much the extent of my raiding.
---
On other other hand, I've finished every living world zone and story on like 14 characters.  I wonder what percentage of those raid statistics are from people who bought raids.
---
Fb pull has like 3 sec cd if an add kill resets the tome axe 3 and gs5 are enough the rest of the time. Also focus is a massive dps loss unlike bringing axe on fb
---
&gt; with karma which is pretty much free for most of us.
---
Have you tried unlocking all the karma skins before using the Guaranteed Wardrobe Unlocks?
---
Full Clear
---
I think mark it's an Iron man reference
---
Against what mob, of what level, do you feel squishy?
---
Fat Charr. It's an RP thing.
---
Fast Clear? 
---
or Flag Carrier if you are in wow battlegrounds
---
I think it's because a road map doesn't mean things will be made. On a roadmap there are sire things, mid term projects and "ideas" yet to be assessed and explore. The company depends on a financial base and things haven't been successful lately. The decreasing population is near dangerous numbers and last year (Q4 2018) was a really low for Anet. It's is imperative to be aware of this things. That's all.
---
Isn't this exactly how mining tools already work?
---
just to clarify, the bladed armor box lets you select any piece of bladed armor including the chestpiece, but you can only obtain it by participating in a map that reaches a T4 map during the night meta. this is basically impossible to do without a heavily coordinated, multi-squad group (this does happen sometimes, keep an eye out for lfg). the bladed coat box is an extremely rare drop from the night meta bosses also.
---
the *rest* of the armor pieces you can buy from itzel vendors with airship parts from airship cargo scattered across the map (they also have a small chance of dropping from airship cargo). you open these with pact crowbars. the *daytime* outpost events give far far more crowbars than the nighttime meta. for whatever reason all the nighttime meta events stop giving crowbars (including events that would normally give crowbars during the day) except a handful for killing each boss. so if you're after airship parts / the non-chest armor you're actually much better off doing the daytime "outpost" events (and any "kill the wandering mordrem" events you find) than the night meta
---
Boon wise, Druid is more than adequate and provides quick 25 might over 10 people without a reliance on fire fields (Tempest), rotational healing access (Tempest and Herald) or slowly building boons (Herald).
---
While other options are viable, as the mirror comp you point out, you are now faced with the issue of less healing type diversity (two engineers), which is a prime reason for not running double druid compositions. You then miss out on the niceties, that aren't the reason why you run druid, such as spotter and spirits. Those are good extras, but they aren't composition defining in the same way that one healer providing 25 might over 10 people is.
---
I guess what OP wants is to use his karma tools with the skin of his bought tools without having to pay a transmutation charge to use that skin every time his karma tool runs out... or something
---
I'm a weirdo that likes the double tap and even then, it's as simple and straightforward as they can make it.
---
IMHO, the best way to introduce it would be instead of a random ring make it a heart in every starting zone with a hazard stripe separating the heart NPC from the collection items. Players must dodge to get over to the items, grab one, dodge back over to the box, and deliver it. 
---
Maybe even "punish" by making them drop the bundle if they're knocked back by the barrier.
---
Additionally, make another heart involve killing weak mobs that have a break bar. Maybe just 10 up in both bars and maybe they only deal cc (so newbies won't be killed but highly inconvenienced until they learn the mechanic). Make the heart NPC give them a bundle that gives them a CC skill and a direct damage skill. They need to use the CC skill to break the bar, then while the mob is stunned, whack it with the damage. 
---
Maybe in this area also have a random event where a veteran or elite version of that mob attacks. It is slow but it has obviously telegraphed AoE attacks that hit for weak damage or CC. To kill it, players must break the bar either with their skills or if they don't have cc, with skills from nearby bundles (complete with a helpful NPC wailing "Come here and get an electro-net-tangle-izer 6000! That'll bring that golem down!"
---
Breaking the bar will stun it long enough for a good long burn, but to kill it, they'll still need at least 2-4 repetitions of the bar breaking cycle.
---
From that foundation, include a few more dodging and break bar hearts and events in the 15-25 zones as well.
---
What are you even rambling about?
---
Last week alone i remember kicking two dps for subpar performance, a renegade for being bad at mechanics and a bannerslave because... Creative differences (he didnt want to do the job we wanted him to do).
---
Also we ask for *very* little (100 ess and not die/wipe the group, do at least mediocre damage). There are many, many, many groups that are way less tolerant (i'm actually trying to work on kicking people early if they are not good).
---
It's interesting data, I'd just be wary of trying to generalise the sample to the overall population which you've mostly already been careful about. In regards to the health of your dataset I'd also be cautious about using LI, LD, Gaeting and Magnetite as your sole metrics since they're a spendable currency. I know a few people who got the LI they needed for three legendary armour sets and then didn't touch raids again. It might be useful to compare the LI/LD figures to unlocks for raid boss kill achievements where applicable. You'll be able to minimise the occurance of false negatives being excluded from your dataset.
---
You might also want to consider the data classification in your results. You infer that the data from the LI/LD lets you know that X% of players have done Y activity. Which isn't strictly accurate. It's X% of accounts, not players, with an API key hooked into the site. I know quite a few raiders who raid on multiple accounts. Please don't take this the wrong way, I'm not trying to nitpick what you've done. It's more that you seem like the kind of person who gives a shit about data and data analysis so I'm hoping that considering these factors will help you in the future.
---
Full Clear. So from start to last boss and beyond.
---
For ex. in the new wing it means starting from the gate opening pre-event and ending at finding the hidden skritt.
---
Either that or they want to apply a glyph in addition to the inherent effect of the karma tool?
---
Why are you always so anti-raids?
---
Since when Cms and t4s became hard? Are you playing a beta patch or something?
---
And yet they restored something less worthly for someone else. Found in a thread bbelow:
---
 " It can also be stressful after being a bit careless. While I was making Stardust Jackal clicking was so tedious I somehow messed up what I put inside Forge (1 more mini instead of unidentified dye) and got random exotic mini instead. I felt aweful but support was really nice and understanding. This makes me stressed whenever I put sth in the Mystic Forge, now I check everything six times. "
---
&gt; I said WvW had a much bigger audience in the past.
---
And that doesn't make much of a difference. What is relevant is where the main target audience is. And that is PvE. Not WvW.
---
If spending more time on PvE grows the playerbase more then focusin on WvW, then you focus on PvE. Simple as that.
---
I was under the impression that the tome reset only reset the tome itself and not the skills inside it?
---
So like, you F1 and spam out your damage and drop it just before a mob dies. When that mob dies you can F1 again a second later, but all those skills will still be on their normal individual CD timers still.
---
Berserker, unless your running Mallyx legend which is condition damage then take rabid.
---
Building for 1% of players doesn't work though, that's why Wildstar died. Performance issues aside, it was an amazing game, the problem is 99% of the population didn't have the time or patience to go through the long attunement process for raids, and 90% weren't good enough for dungeons, and by the time they did anything about it by adding shiphands missions and adventures, the game was already dead.
---
That is how it works the skills themselves have a really shied cd tho especially the pull
---
I'll add, a revamped Crafting system:
---
We all hit 400-500  only to jump on ascended or legendary items. But  in all this years of me playing I have never minded the first stages of crafting. I only lvled 1 profession in a slowly and steady manner,  back when I started my first character. But thats it. It never helped me. Never used a crafted item.
---
A good improvement should be make them better than dried items, better enough so we can actually pay attention to those items.
---
Cooking system new ideas:
---
Damn that thing is abandoned. A few players make the flood for the whole community. How is that a good feature?
---
Cooking should be rewarding for those who make it. For the example, cooking should be part of a daily activity, that give a specific boost so it's worth go farming ingredients and cook something. Then use that cooked food in a meaningful way. We could donate part of that food to a donation system so it helps a certain meta over the map and make that meta move and change from region to region (part of the Pact objectives) like donating for the pact on HoT maps, or in Orr areas, or in Elona. You could be part of long delivery routes and get buffed for taking things to in e place to the other (mounts now could help) like the Dolyak routs on WvW. 
---
Now That sounds fun.
---
The tools need to be account bound. And they just sell skins and glyphs going forward. I get really fed up of putting them in and out of my shared slot every time I change char.
---
More often then not I forget and have to relog and switch them.
---
It's easy. You can only pick between 3 and 2 of them are useless. Pick berserker's.
---
I don't think that's the case. Large group coordinated content is fun, but not everyone has the time to spend an entire day wiping over and over until they finally beat it.
---
I used to love hard PVE, back in the day I spent weeks learning MCHM in Tera to beat it, a dungeon that took a month before anyone beat because of difficult and mechanics alone, not gear.
---
Nowadays I work full time and go to university full time, so I don't have time for hard raids.
---
s4e6 was designed to be a potential closing chapter for gw2's story due to anet's own uncertainty about any following content. this is neither speculation nor just a guess.
---
Yes... thanks for understanding.
---
I dont want to use a transmute every 2 days, but I guess that is an option I hadn't considered.
---
I'll try that too.
---
Any tips on what the best crafting professions to take? I'm not sure what drops the least in the game (and I still haven't figured out a few things like upgrade slots )
---
Really wish they'd add an easy mode to raids for people to learn mechanics
---
There are 2 in every city other than Hoelbrak near a Norn shaman who will teleport you to Hoelbrak.  They have the Dragon Bash marker on the map.  It's not much, but it's honest work.
---
&gt;This is exactly the reason easy mode raids won't work, they are trying to cater to a demographic which doesn't care for the gamemode at all/will not put the effort in to learn past that.
---
Who says raids have to be hard? A raid is basically just a dungeon but with more players. WoW has raidfinder and that works fine. You can have raids that are easy modes, I just think rewards should be adjusted accordingly, the best rewards should come from hard modes
---
&gt; not because of gear requirementss
---
Mostly because of gear requirements. Definitely in WoW for example. All bosses would be dead without that. Because it allows the developers to balance bosses much higher. Since gear progression will over time make the bosses possible for normal players, when their gear is high enough.
---
In other words, WoW doesn't have to cater to the tiny amount of actual hardcore guilds. They get their challenge and with gear progression, the kill (including challenge modes and the like) will be reachable for other players as well.
---
Any challenge mode in GW2 that is our of reach for normal groups. Will always be out of reach for them.
---
only berserker's of those is useful. also shortbow is predominantly a condi weapon FYI.
---
I'll tell you this much - if u have a friend working in game development that knows basics ask them, because you won't believe anything i say anyway. You won't like the reply though i guarantee that.
---
If you already have those professions zerked, you can easily make a power quickbrand by using Potent Lucent Oil+Soul Pastry as consumables. Or if you want to try-hard, you can also add in a sigil of concentration on weapon.
---
To get chrono supportable, you'll need to buy a new main-hand sword, sigil of concentration, pack runes and farm the diviner's armors from newest LWS map's achievements (takes about 2-3 hours if you don't miss any bosses on boss train).
---
Build: http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQRAse8dnsIC9filfCGoBUrhlVjqcDGhAoeZj2p9sJSiiA-jBSBQBT8JAgH9D/V9Gis/gZUCeFlfA4kAQJVEIFwuD3A-e
---
If you'll want to go for healbuild, you'll need to farm at least harrier's trinkets, weapons and most likely some armors (Magi's armors might be enough if you know your stuff well) in any case.
---
Assassin's Coat?
---
I meant 18 lol
---
You could save the coffers.  After the festival is over, the price should go back up.
---
Djinn Portals from the raid, and then make a nice big lounge up there --&gt; people will go up.
---
why is that posted twice with different users and the exact same title?!
---
Ideally harder difficulties would have higher chances of dropping rare drops. So for example maybe easy has a 1% chance, normal has a 5% chance, hard has a 20% chance. So the idea would be you do hard modes because it's the most time efficient if you're good, or easy if you really want the reward but don't want to put in the effort to learn the harder mode.
---
You joke, but I'm serious here, I for one am fucking happy that Anet can look at what WoW does poorly and avoid it.
---
It's the same as when people cried for Griffon/Skyscale to actually be flying mounts, instead of gliding/hovering mounts.
---
WoW has done this things, and people not only hate it, devs have called em **mistakes**.
---
Holo is still a good but not anywhere near best in slot DPS spec. Pretty middle of the pack in that regard. It is still a very solid PvP spec and somewhat okay in WvW for very small scale stuff.
---
Scrapper is complete dogshit in PvE as per ancient tradition but it's also very sought after in WvW as a support and it is a good sustain spec for PvP.
---
first he took my guild then he took my talent.
---
It's always the silent ones.
---
Holo is meta in pvp and strong in raids. Stay with it if you like it.
---
No, GW2 support is a joke compared to any game with real support. There are no "damage taken by this players is reduced by 99%" "this player is immune to damage" or "this player gets healed whenever he takes damage for the next 30 seconds". You also can't outheal many mechanics. If in 100cm the bomb explodes you can't heal this. If people in thaumanova drop down off the platforms you can't heal them. If people in 99cm bullet hell fuck up their circle you can't heal them. If a player in 99cm siax fails to kill his npc you can't heal your team. If one player fails that's ok, the other 4 carry it. If 4 players fail you got a problem.
---
I don't expect such "easy mechanics". I'm pointing out that it possible to have challenging and easy content at the same time. Depending on your playstyle. Fast and efficient farm? Difficult! Slow and safe: easy. 
---
&gt;That's less than the 2g you get from dailies.
---
Yes, and to earn 10 gold from dailies takes a casual a month. No, the damage diffference is not negligible. Especially bad teams need every single percent of extra damage they can get. For good teams it does not matter. For bad teams it does. Every single percent extra damage by gear allows a little bit more of imperfection in rotations etc.
---
&gt;You want 2 experienced players to be able to carry the inexperienced ones, right?
---
So why are so many raid players so pissed off about bad CC in bad teams? If they can easily duo CC bars down?
---
&gt;You can maintain enough DPS to beat the timers on these fights by just auto attacking on meta specs, even if every DPS player does that. 
---
only in good teams, but not if half the team is busy reviving each other half the time.
---
&gt;That's on them. Full stop. It's not unreasonable to expect them
---
Oh boy, you really don't understand casuals, do you? They just want to play the game. If someone plays 1 hour a week he is not going to spend 100% of his weekly game time on researching and watching a video instead. Yes, if someone REALLY REALLY wants to get into raids these videos are helpful. But for most casuals it's more like "well, I'd like to get into raids...oh wow, that's too much effort for content I don't even know. Maybe I don't like raids, who knows? Well...nothing else to do here...mhh...well WoW is said to be good game".
---
I tried exactly this. My guild pressured me to get into raids. I linked them builds. No one cared to adapt their builds. I linked them a single boss guide. No one watched it. It's "homework". Not fun for these players. They don't enjoy it. As explained lengtily above, twice: players want to go into content. Unprepared. Want to succeed. And then, if they enjoy the content, then they start to optimize, organise. Not the other way round. That's something only hardcoreplayers do. No one gets a GW2 guild before he even has bought the game. That's not how it works.
---
And yes, it is on the players. Tell that to wildstar. Has it helped wildstar that it was a great game with great raids - and only failed "because it is on the players"? No. See? If GW2 raids are not able to attract a wide audience they will suffer the same fate as wildstar. That was said when the first raid got released and one of the better arguments for an easymode. Well...look at raids now. Is the raid community happy? Satisfied with the amount of content? Or would more content be better? For more content a bigger raid playerbase would be needed. Simple as that.
---
They will probably remove the hill at the start of the Video, that allrdy fixes most of it, but no clue how to fix the jump over the gate.
---
rhi carrying the group again
---
Remember when mount skins were gated behind RNG?
---
That wasn't an accident. It had to go through multiple development phases, including planning, programming, and marketing. It was *fully* intentional, and deliberate.
---
Do you like human politics, a kidnap plot, current affairs, espionage, and pirates? Order of Whispers. They seek to send the dragons back to sleep. Your mentor will be Tybalt, a charr. 
---
Do you like archeology, learning about the past, history, would you like to be an academic? Durmand Priory. They believe the best way to stop the dragon threat is learning all we can about them, and how people in the long forgotten past survived their onslaught. Your mentor will be Sieran, a sylvari.
---
Holo is good in raids, and you will probably be at top dps with even the simple kitless build, while raiding with pugs.
---
It's specially hurtful in GW2 because or endgame is 100% cosmetic. Other games focus their attention on stats and abilities, while cosmetics are secondary, but not here.
---
If fashion wars is the endgame, GW2 is pretty much P2W. The imbalance between game rewards and gem store products is off the charts.
---
Thx seems I have to camp the map some for some good ol viper armor ^^
---
Warrior is used at every single boss except for one.
---
Exactly, other games being worse might make us better, but that doesn't mean we're actually good.
---
&gt; in fact i know that you are one of those people that take the concept of "play as you want" over the concept of personal responsibility in group content.
---
This is not true at all though.  It is not hard to tell people what builds are good and how to play them, and this stuff is widely accessible and most people actually follow it. Or if actually group says "we play this strategy", I never seen anyone going against it. 
---
The problem is general atmosphere. The group also has responsibility, even if it is basic communication. People rather leave than say where was issue and go again, now successfully because the issue was fixed. Nobody tries to fix why group wiped and how to learn something from it. Everyone just searches for easiest way for loot and hopes that they will be lucky that random won't expose that issues again.
---
Compare it with progression groups just after raids are released. People point out what was wrong and it is okay, as it is the way how to learn and get better. And they go again and progress further. But normally there is absolute zero of this, you either know magically everything or gtfo. It is no fun then and people stop playing it. Not because they couldn't play as they want, but because something surprised them and the rest of group sees it as reason to kick, not as a reason to teach that new person how to be better next time. Everyone just claims that kicking that person saves time, then they proceed to wait 10 minutes in lfg, or disbanding completely.
---
All good but gw3 is financially imposible. Unless the mmorpg economic environment changes... Makiig new MMO's it's not profitable for now. Not here in the West area at least.
---
It's worse than bad. The gem store pretty much kills any carrots the game could have, severely impacting retention and fidelity.
---
Honestly who needs to see clones/phantasms anyway? 100% screen clutter.
---
So the problem is we don't have a test server that top teams can use to give feedback to the devs?
---
That's brilliant! Sadly, it is not an option in-game.
---
&gt; But it's quite interesting to observe that, assuming the raiders continued to play LS 3 and LS 4, that means majority of the living story playerbase have at least attempted or even cleared a raid encounter. But of course, we have no way of knowing that they are the same players.
---
Not even close. Most players don't have a GW2 efficiency account. And it isn't all that hard to figure out, that the ones who do are far more likely to be more active in the game as well. Which heavily skewes the data in favour of "hardcore" players.
---
I think "mount skins", as in skins for the existing mount models, should have been 100% part of the game.
---
Then the "new mounts", as in complete remodels (like the Shrine Guardian jackal, Sun temple Geck springer, etc) would be gem store only.
---
I haven't even zoned into a raid
---
Content is a different problem, they spend too many resources on "action scenes" bullshit, instead of actual meaningful content. The fight against Kralkatorrik in Ep. 5? Could have been an open world event. The fight against Joko in Ep. 3? Could have been a dungeon or a raid.
---
Story instances are a complete waste of potential and content.
---
simply set up a one line script. which translates your left mouse button to 1.
---
&gt;For all we know, that was the intended target audience.
---
For all we know that is totally wrong. No sane MMO developer would target ONLY the casual playerbase. Why would they develop [super hard, very coordinated group style content](http://www.tentonhammer.com/articles/gw2-interview-with-colin-johanson-on-dungeons-and-underwater-content)? Why would they develop two competitive game modes? Things that no casual player cares about were an integral part of the game. WvW was a much larger part of the game experience before megaservers. You fought for PvE buffs for your whole server in WvW, WvW players came to Lion's Arch to ask for help when their keeps were attacked and PvE players helped them out. One could argue that WvW, a competitive game mode, was intended to be the endgame experience.
---
The playerbase shifted towards a more casual audience because anet gave their competitive modes not enough attention and the non-casuals left the game. And now the narrative is that GW2 was ALWAYS a casual focused game, which just isn't true.
---
The rarity is only part of the problem, and it's not the *main* reason, as stated in the OP.
---
The main reason is that we do not see if you lost the infusion or not. Infusions, runes, sigills and so on are logged in the system in a way that does not allow us to trace it in the same way some other items would allow us to. That does not mean the team does not try - we still run logs, we still check if we can see if the item was used and what might have happened.
---
Sadly, in most of the cases, we cannot trace them. This was in the past heavily abused by some players when they contacted us, stating they lost the Moto Infusion - when they had not. We granted some users several of them as a result (and there's still the reddit thread about that fact somewhere around here).
---
Any anything we do, by that suspending a player, granting an item, changing guild leadership - we base it all on our logs and records. If these do not show something, then we will try to help if it does not have the chance of breaking anything... but if it could for example mean we dupe an item, then we sadly cannot.

&gt;That's true, although I often reset it to not auto-attacking by left clicking out of habit.
---
Not to make light of your condition, but that's not a problem with the game, that's a problem with you. You can't expect a game to change because you are developing a handicap or sickness; you have to work around that yourself and change your habits accordingly..
---
&gt; I'd believe you if it weren't for the fact that "Triple A" gaming companies are firing hundreds of their own workers despite record profits with loot boxes.
---
Again, do you have any idea how companies work? How anything works?
---
Companies are not charities. You don't hire people based on your profit. You hire people if you think you will need them. If you have work for them.
---
Also: "The new round of layoffs involved ‚Äúnon-development roles,‚Äù"
---
So no, these lay-offs have nothing to do with game development or the content they can add to a game.
---
They don't seem to realize this is a game, and gameplay goes first. No content, people get bored, they leave, and they don't buy gem store crap.
---
Why did PoF release without an extensive mount racing system? Why do we no longer get jumping puzzles? Why were dungeons scrapped?
---
But of course, we spend all our resources in cool explosions for the story instances, which most people only play once, if ever.
---
It isn't just the gem store, the whole game is terribly mismanaged.
---
&gt;  I bought GW2, both the expansions, most of living seasons 3 and 4 (had been on a break before release), and I have spent money in the store on other things.
---
Ok, let's just eave it at that. If you don't even understand what "financing" means, I might as well just talk to a brick wall.
---
you are absolutely right... in a world where beginners have no choice but to sneak into experienced group, which surprisingly isn't this world. just as there are resources to get decent builds, there are resources to learn about bosses. training runs don't care much about how often you fuck up, even if you were too lazy to fill all of even their requirements (reading up on stuff, sorting out a build, try the rotation once or twice. experienced groups naturally are looking for experienced people - kp are essentially a way of asking for a certain degree of familiarity and confidence with an encounter - and beginners have little business joining them.
---
an experienced raider has absolutely no obligation to spend hours on a single encounter to go through the entire learning experience again due to a single person not being up to the task, or in other words: to try and carry a beginner and/or leech. i know, what a crazy complex concept.
---
Do you have a link for that? Curious to see what they said.
---
The combat and movement is one of the best things of this game, if not the very best, and the sole reason I'm still playing.
---
I despise how underutilized it is. It's like having a ferrari but no roads to drive it in.
---
Finally someone posted this. Maybe anet can fix it now that it is on reddit.
---
Greens on Deimos being culled so you're not actually sure who has it and where you need to stand
---
Adds on Sabir being culled so you can't tell if they're up
---
Players **not** being culled if you're in a squad with them on the same map, regardless of distance - if you're in the top left of the map, and everyone else is at the bottom right, and you leave squad, you gain like 10-20 FPS
---
Karka Queen not actually being visible because there's more than 20 people fighting her
---
Dangerous attacks in PvP not being telegraphed or even visible because there's more than two mesmers in the match. Like heck I know my model limit is low and you don't want to cull clone models because of the misdirection value, but I'd be fine with my limit being temporarily set to max in that situation
---
On the surface, only because we combine into 200s. But why not let us make 400s and 800s? Redo the tiers if necessary or just keep them all legendary past that point.
---
im a new spellbreaker and in spvp I can do well against most classes but I struggle against mesmers.  Any tips to defeating mesmers? they hit so fucking hard and when they use kage bunshin I struggle to find the real one
---
:))))
---
Its free.  Play it and make your own opinion
---
I'm sure you know this, but just in case: Do you know that holding down the left mouse button will cycle through the autoattack?
---
Take in mind the numbers might be skewed. Gw2 Efficiency favors raid numbers and disfavors LS numbers, because a lot of alt accounts registered, and those who do register on GW2 Efficiency are likely to be considered hardcore players are not casual players (casual players don't go around generating api keys and registering themselves in these sites).
---
With that in mind, the numbers must not be too far off. I wonder why less people played LS4 when apparently we have more players than before.
---
Blasphemy! You have *both* the hat and the hair!
---
I should feel excited about this new farming method because with more gold means more shinies for me!
---
But lately I feel a little lost with the game. My current goal is to finish bolt so i can have both legendary swords on my mesmer, and after that there really isn't anything else and the lack of the next goal is slowly dwindling my motivation to complete bolt. I realize the game is no longer keeping my interest anymore and it frightened me at first because I love GW2, especially in recent times with the new events. The game feels to go in the right direction, just needs time to get some momentum.
---
Tbh you won't get the MMO itch with gw2 because majority of content can be done solo and is generally braindead. It's just a glorified dress up/scavenger hunt game with chat and occasional world boss. 
---
That being said, there's a huge amount of content in game and a lot of people playing it (even though you can ignore that fact most of the time) in almost all zones and levels. 
---
What keeps me in the game is probably people I met in group content because that's the only part of the game you don't want to do alone (or with lfg in some cases), but since group content has low priority I don't play as often as I used to.
---
I'd suggest checking at least core game to see if you like it because expansion content is definitely better.
---
The "no expansions" thing is speculation, and we're definitely getting large content patches coming.
---
Gw2 does "Living World", episodic large patches that contain new masteries, bosses, maps, raids, features, etc. We get 5 or so spaced over several months, the next series of those is in the pipeline.
---
The thing that keeps me coming back is the fun combat, the "go at your own pace" nature, and the fact that my past progress will not be nullified I the next big patch or expansion, something I couldn't shake the feeling of in WoW.
---
exotic luck is 200, legendary is 500. Why not combine 5 exotic to make 2 legendary. It wouldn't be the first recipe where the outcome is more than just one item...foods do that quite a bit.
---
Anyone may always request an escalation of any issue, we do not make any secret of that. 
---
Escalations come with two caveats: The ticket will slow down a lot, so be ready for that - SGMs and LGMs do a lot of stuff besides tickets, and unlike the foot soldiers, tickets are not our main focus. The other is, that (unlike what was discussed in the thread further down), SGMs and LGMs do not have special magic abilities or logs that regular GMs do not. We use the same tools for the most part. So an escalation does not automatically equate a different outcome. That, too, needs to be kept in mind.
---
That is true, I can agree with that that we shouldn't critize bad things because others have it worse.
---
I don't really see your second point, though. The flow of people seem pretty stable to me, I really haven't seen a sudden dropoff that you seem to be implying. And even then, it's definitely not going to be because of a lack of rewards...the way how this game goes about with its rewards is certainly its own thing, but it has been like that for almost 7 years. I don't see people suddenly kneejerk react and throw a fit now, those people would've quite a month after release.
---
I mean, it's a thing you pay real money for where what you get is determined randomly.  It may not be quite as bad as BLCs but it's still a gambling mechanic.
---
It takes like a week of regular play to get. The Skyscale is by far the strongest mount. It rivals the jackal in speed, the springer in vertical movement, and destroys the griffon in air time. It's insane, frankly.
---
That's good to hear. However, the existence of lootboxes really hurts.
---
I still enjoy the game and it's my favourite fame, but stuff like the black lion chest exclusive items really prey on people with gambling addictions and people in bad mental states.
---
Well done !
---
This is exactly my point!
---
Why even have tiered luck at all, but rather just let us combine infinitely and it makes one item? So we could have a +370 Luck or a +1120 Luck and everything bigger than 500 has the Legendary icon.
---
That thought led to questioning why it's an item at all.
---
You either did not watch the video or are willfully ignoring what it said.
---
People with gambling problems do not have really have full control over their actions. It is a mental illness.
---
and have you gotten your own zerg following you?
---
Jim has broken down in pretty thorough detail why this argument is crap in other videos. Here's one from last year: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vcebekI9F7g
---
It goes straight into your innentory and prompts you to pick AG
---
Not enough infusions
---
This is pretty much why I've gotten bored of GW2. I now rarely play but I still join my guild events whenever I can.
---
Seriously, the lack of glider and mount skins available in-game killed any desire I had for end game. I haven't put any $$ since I got PoF. The BLC and MTX heavy content turned me away. I'd rather gring Metroidvania solo games now.

Official retailers with discounts? I know two local shops (one is a very big international multimedia retailer) who used to sell them but they where never on discount.  
---
But I never bought gem codes there. I have been using an online gamecard shop from the netherlands who sells 2000 gems for E18,95 for several years now and I'm quite satisfied with them. My first purchase with them was when GW2 was about a year old and my last was yesterday. The gems get a little cheaper too if you buy more. I would never buy gems ingame as the prices are just a massive rip off.
---
Make the gate go all the way up, I mean, why wouldn't it
---
&gt; That doesn't take into account people that quit playing after registering on gw2efficiency though.
---
And lets not forget it also doesn't take into account the people who haven't actually registered for gw2efficiency at all, making any percentual claims dodgy at best
---
&gt;  the game makes you bland and ugly on purpose, gives you no useful utilities or space to hold stuff, the npcs yell "shiny" all the time
---
Reminds me of that NPC in the starting point of HoT that says "That's great looking armor!" whenever you walk by, making you think "aww" then only to realize they are talking to another NPC.
---
it's pretty much the same build except you use staff and focus more on healing power(camp water 24/7 which is why it's afk mode)
---
no real guide besides some generic advice..you literally camp water and spam auras
---
[here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Support_Healer) is the metabattle version
---
however, i would advise you to use harrier gear anyway! tempest really shines in giving boons nowadays and the staff version is mostly to carry bad pugs at desmina, matthias and other heavy pressure bosses or kite at dhuum etc.
---
what i mean is, most of the time you should be on [this one](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/tempest/heal/) and just have a magi staff for those specific scenarios
---
oh, too bad \~sadface\~ :(
---
Question about Holy Strike, Guardian's Staff #2 skill. It says it heals for 594 and 4 pulses. Does that mean it will heal for 594\*4 ?
---
Enough with the "Mists" already ... there are already thousands of sets with Mist in their name
---
&gt; and is actually "meta"
---
no, it's not.
---
&gt;places that require ludicrous amounts of condition cleanse
---
there is no encounter or place that requires this, hence why it isn't meta.
---
&gt;they convert ALL conditions cleansed into boons
---
You already have every single boon readily avaliable in meta comps so it's nothing to write home about.
---
It should prioritize showing enemies over allies since that is the bigger threat.
---
&gt; and that we have so many odd coding workarounds like Desmina's walls counting as enemy models and mounts as chairs.
---
not as odd as neutral flagpoles counting as enemies
---
Geez man, I told ya to be careful :P
---
**Scepter** as main weapon.
---
 It would have blast finishers and whirl finishers to round out the many leap and projectile finishers the class currently has access to.
---
**Theme - Geomancy**, a Ranger's take on Elementalist. Class mechanic would remove weapon swap but grant the class ways to create fields and swap between different skills based on what kind of field you are standing in. Would be all about having bonus synergy with combo finishers, the ability to make any field they needed with class mechanics, and have built in priority for their greater combo fields (to help let them use skills they need as they create those fields).
---
**Lore** would be that its largely based from a few modern practitioners who are in contact with what is left of the Maguuma druids. Be it through meeting spirits from Draconis Mons or what was left of them deep in Auric Basin, a group of adventurers have felt the call and found the world to be growing sick and poison around the edges where magic runs wild and reality grows sick from its touch. Their job would be to help smooth out where this sickness grows, purifying and helping to balance the excess magic and to repair where the world is blighted and twisted from it.
---
Very likely working with Aurene to help balance magic to that new end, class armour piece would be shoulders with blue crystal blooms to help signify that relation, but their class skills all borrow from druidic imagery.
---
**Locations for such characters to be focused on Lorewise** - Dragon brand, helping cleanse Orr, looking for Rifts to clean up, some would be in Ascalon helping to remove the last traces of the Searing, etc.

Getting a decent build will not tell you the mechanics of an encounter.  Having someone give you the run-down of the encounter will.  I will not sit and watch a damn video.  If it's in print then I'll read it, I hate videos (yes, I get it, that's my take on life.  I do not want to listen to someone talk.  I do NOT learn when people are talking, I learn from doing and reading.)  
---
No, I do not raid, not worth my time.  I play WvW instead, where when the group wipes the commander explains what went wrong and we try the fight again usually without the wiping the second time.  
---
I am perfectly familiar with builds, I am familiar with timing of skills, but if the only information about an encounter involves a video.  I'm not going to know (or care) which the reason I personally never got into raids. 
---
I think telling other people that they are "wasting other's times" because their "builds are bad" ignores the problem of rotations, and knowing where to stand and what to expect in an encounter.  Your build can be the best there is in the game but if you have zero idea what you're supposed to do in an encounter/fight then you're not going to be contributing to the group.  Having someone spell it out in the beginning complete with showing where to be and what is expected makes the whole thing go better.   Telling someone "go watch x youtube video" that's the reason I chose not to raid.
---
I agree.
---
The dialogue box should be as big as your entire screen, with size 35+ caps locked arial font, bolded and highlighted, and prevent you from doing absolutely anything else, including alt+f4-ing the game until you click ok.
---
...but wait, I am 110% sure people will still fuck it up; because there's no helping dumb and impatient people.
---
PS: Infusions swap out on legendaries with no dialogue box. There's a reason they get special treatment...cause they're legendaries.
---
This came out great! Thanks for doing it and to everyone who participated!
---
Each class has different skills based on what weapon they are currently wielding, so if you want to be melee you can. All you'd have to do is use a weapon with melee range skills.
---
 Mesmers do illusion and trickery effects that make them harder to catch and they can confuse and befuddle their adversaries. Necromancers have deathly green and black effects and steal life force while debilitating their enemies.
---
Esports and hyper-competetive mentality was not sticking, and developing around it was hurting the game type, not every game should be forced into that.
---
But that would mean pre-80's and f2p players would be allowed to use it. This should be baseline.
---
He's the commander you see in ls4 and pof trailer

I‚Äôm in a guild that offers several training raids during weekdays and weekends. Then there are advanced training raids as a leg up before you join an ongoing static. If you are interested in checking it out let me know and I‚Äôll get an officer to shoot you an invite. (No rep guild) 
---
Also consider pugging raids as you get more experience. It takes some patience, but it can be really enjoyable. Sure there are times I get booted because of x reason; just move on. I‚Äôm up to 272 Boss kills so far and have pugged over half of that since raids came out.
---
I assume the pack is 2000 gems?
---
Are those adjusted to account for the number of people who own the associated expansion?
---
12% is plenty, check the percentage on "Everlasting Ally of Ahdashim"
---
TBH this time I'm not very happy after amazing Shimmerwing all these new skins looks very low res to me, Bioluminescent is kinda decent but still looks blurry when you zoom in
---
the problem is that raid content is not a priority for this company and thus resources (like PTR) and time/people aren't invested to make things better. having a PTR would help, but only if they were actually going to invest time into first making a raid, and then to tuning it after its built. this likely doesnt align with the gem shop and naturally gets less attention. until they can find out how to monetize raids/fractals/spvp in the way they can/have the casual content things wont change.
---

please avoid the first two. It's horrible enough that existing PvP/WvW equipment are some form of "Adjective Glory/Hero Hero".

You can bet PvP folks would grind for it.

Well, we're describing a self-selected sample to represent the population. It's the best data we've got, without Anet's tools.
---
Ardent Glory

Glory Hero
---
Mist Glory Hero
---
Triumph Hero
---
Mist Triumph Hero
---
Yea lets add more stuff with the words "Mist", "Hero" and synonyms viz Elite, Vet, Champ, Legend.
---
World record dungeons did that and we were okeyy back in time.. !
---
What about the orange death wall on SH or the tri-spokes from sabir? I cant see either of these even after doing a repair and changing settings. Any insight?
---
Same deal as it was with Warclaw pack: 1-2 actually good skins, rest are recolors with more dye channels.
---
I'm pretty much the majority when it comes to this.
---
Did a few HoT raids when they were new with my guild, but didn't end up enjoying them enough and stopped by the time PoF came out. I just don't like how this game handles 10-man content.
---
I am sorry Etheri but i can not keep on responding to you. You keep on inventing things i never said and make the posts about you as if it is you that we write about and not World verses World and how Arena net don't manage to make it in to what the players want. Some how you fell off the road we went were we shared the passion for the game mode and some how you made it personal and about you and follow that up with changing my words in to something i never said or never felt or never had a interest in. I talk about WvW and what is going on in it and why i belive things is how they are and why i belive things work and not work. I thought you did the same but it seem like you lost the way and went on a me-trip.
---
And with that i have nothing else to say about you as a person because i have no opinion about you and your choices. They are yours and you should play it the way you feel and want too,
---
If you want to continue about my statement i made in the first post then we can talk about that, but we talk about RoS as a server and what it was before people left it and why it went wrong, and not about you. You are not a server, you are just you, a WvW player.
---
You can get infinite copies for free? Which vendor?
---
Definitely Berserker's
---
It's kinda the same trend they've set with the other skins. Shimmerwing is an exclusive skin with a high price tag, so it looks much better and more detailed than the others. 
---
Kind of like how lion griffon looks much more unique than the other griffons, and so on for the other expensive skins.
---
yes
---
If anyone is curious about the dye channels [here are what the patterns look like in game](https://i.imgur.com/OQZ1ZdB.jpg)
---
I would add to that the inability to click on most bosses or adds easily. Not only can you not differentiate between the 5000 effects going off in the stack, you cant even click on bosses half the time without trying a few times.
---
Testing internally != being released. They might have tested it and figured out that it wouldn't really work out well in the game and thus scrapped it.

Whispers 4TW
---
Tho I am still mad at ANet that Whusper agents don't salute me with "Lightbringer" whenever I come near them. By the way, it will be cool to have faction titles here, such as Lightbringer, Priorist and Vigil Soilder. (Sorry, not so sure how to name the other 2, as both toon with whom I completed PS were from Whispers... twice the pain at Claw Island)
---
They're catering to all people by doing that. Some people would rather have simplistic skins with more dye opportunities than a super flashy and unrealistic skin.
---
And yet they did make changes just last week that was connected to Alliances. Seems quite silly to do something like that for something that is never coming, surely?
---
Lol The first time I saw that tablet, I thought it was part of the environment and tried interacting with it. Why is it following me?? Then I thought it was like the red orbs or blue spinning death traps from bosses. I like finding new things in the game so it was fun trying to figure it out. But I felt bad once I realized.. oops. That person was trying to help me. Or mess with me. Ngl I made a rev so I could chase new people around with that tablet.
---
Anyone know if the skins change the engage skill color, like the Shimmerwing skin does?
---
I wish you could buy this like the other mount packs and get a random skin.... $25 is too much for some of us. :(
---
As a general rule of thumb I use, is if it contains "Toughness" do not chose it unless you are desperate or are in a pure tank build. I even salvage all the ascend I recieve if it contains Tough at all.
---
I've never had problems visualizing those. I have an Intel 6700k and a Nvidia 960, 16g of ram, run max settings on everything but with character model limits set to low/very low.    
---
The only raid encounter mechanic that culls are deimos hands, because there's so many of them. Just my experience.
---
there's an NPC in Hoelbrak talking about taking the fight to Zhaitan rn, they clearly didn't check the dialogue or were too lazy to update it for veteran players
---
Not always true, for example, Outrider skin for Warclaw is like my most favorite mount skin ever, highly detailed and sharp and it was a part of the same type of skin pack.
---
Don't be intimidated by the long loop. While DH does have a rotation, you primarily need an understanding how to chain your burst skills together to get optimal results. That means knowing which skills to use under the influence of F1 and a symbol. If you understand that, the rotation is just the icing on the cake which will yield the final 5-10% of the benchmark.
---

---
What if they made it so you just can't overwrite an infusion that has the same stats or higher? You'd have to use an infusion extractor first. Imo it sounds a hell of a lot better to force the player to use a 25s item in this particular situation instead of accidentally deleting an infusion that could be worth several hundred/thousand gold. Only issue is I think you need the mastery to buy the infusion extractor? So f2p players could potentially get shafted.
---
With the success of revamped dragon bash, and loose talk about WvW and sPvP holidays, I'd like to see more holiday type events that take us to places in the world we haven't been in a while. WoW added something they call "Micro-holidays" which are small unique events that happen one day out of the year, often in a small village in a zone nobody goes to or something like that.
---
For expansions, I'm all aboard that Cantha train. Kaening city was one of the coolest areas aesthetically from gw1 in my book.
---
Great timing, just when there is a post right here in this very subreddit talking about predatory micro-transactions and lootboxed. Waiting someone to comment ‚Äútake my money‚Äù
---
&gt; That doesn't take into account people that quit playing after registering on gw2efficiency though
---
and there are accounts registered that are made for only one purpose, to have one spot in the top 10 on some random statistic. e.g. one of my non-main accounts is rank5 in racing medallions.
---
You have to remember that not everyone who did 1 encounter in wing 1-4 actually raided. Many people purchased one boss kill just so they could open up and complete the masteries.
---
If it were a random sample it would be more than enough people. However the group of people that would register for an external site related to a game is far from a random sample and is certain to skew towards more every day and hardcore players.
---
To paraphrase: "The world. The world never changes."
---
There's still the guy in that bar in Divinity's Reach, going on about how great Caudecus is.
---
Yeah. Pretty much why I haven't bought gliders or mounts for 4 years now.
---
Once you get a decent amount of stash tabs, collectible increases and shared slots, you don't need more.
---
I still play sporadically but I will admit the gem store exclusivity pisses me off.
---
I would like to see something in between. I was there in wow when LFR was introduced and for me it took away the challenge and fun of seeing a raid progress the way I had been used to. Eventually I stopped running normal raids and then quit all together. I‚Äôve been a big fan of raids here in GW2 (and would love to see more!) 
---
I think an intro easy mode for 1 boss or 1 event in each wing could be a way to open the door to people to see mechanics and unlock things like raid mastery in a much more forgiving easy mode. I‚Äôm think making the whole wing easy mode will take away from the current raid base similar to what I experienced in wow.
---
You could even take it a step further and offer incentive to vets and include a carry option similar to what I‚Äôve seen in destiny 2 where a vet signs up to help carry and gets paired with a team looking for experienced players. As for rewards I think easy mode could offer pieces of LI and LD that you can combine after x number to make 1. Maybe even off a option to grab weapons after x number of kills similar to how golden fractal weapons can be earned with pristine relics.  I also think an automated Easy Mode LFG tool like how spvp queues or wow LFR does would make it a lot more successful instead of waiting on someone to tag and form.
---
Bets on which one is next?
---
Amazon has them but I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre sold at a discount. You could take a chance with one of the 3rd part sellers but you do so at your own risk.
---
Fractals would be a solid Pve endgame if you have no xpacks.
---
WvW if that interests you.
---
Nope, I gave the data as they are given from gw2efficiency, showing the totals. I also intentionally put the Raid Wings right after the release of the relevant episodes to make a better comparison.
---
.... F*** Steve
---
Sure it can work, just have to be creative in how you approach it. I agree after your comment the fights would be pretty short; you could lump Wings 1-4, and 5-7 (and eventually 8 if it has LD too) and have a portal open after the easy boss kill to move to the next wing. If someone drops the lead/vet/whoever requeues the squad etc. Anet has shown various ways in GW2 and 1 for that matter that they can adjust difficulty in various gamemodes, and could figure something out in raids I‚Äôm sure! (Remember the fractal Level rework from 50 - 100?)
---
They linked different servers, they do this for years now. Nothing new
---
This is interesting, but be careful to draw too much from it.
---
For example, I've completed a raid wing, but do not have a desire to enter another GW2 raid. I simply find that I enjoy FFXIV and WoW more for that sort of thing. Conversely, I will play every single living story update they add.
---
I can't convert without expansions...
---
&gt; Exactly, a lot of people wouldn't want a sub fee. WoW and FFXIV, the two largest MMOS out there are the only ones that managed to establish themselves with a subscription fee.
---
The Sub Fee used to be a normal feature though that other publishers dropped to try to be a cheaper experience. 
---
EVE online is a subscription game and doing fine, for example. 
---
You can't point at the graveyard of subscription games between 2003 (wow) and 2010 (FFXIV 1.0) and say it doesn't work, because there's a graveyard of freemium / f2p MMOs just as large in that same time period. 
---
*Most* MMOs fail regardless of cashflow model, of the MMOs that did not fail since 1999 (EverQuest) - i.e. turned enough revenue to stay up for say, &gt;5 years - the majority are actually subscription games and games like GW2 are the exception.
---
Does anyone know if they plan to bring back the Inquest skins for the new mounts?
---
I'm pretty sick of this map. I doubt I could stand anymore of it even if it rained down 100gold an hour.

Please point out to me where it is then, 4 posts below is regarding Gem Code Retailers. Perhaps I have the OP blocked at some point. Maybe have an open mind once in a while.
---
Ah, thought this was a new NPC for the festival. A shadowy group of disillusioned veterans trying to take down Aurene would make an interesting antagonist for the new season. Bran's Jormag team fits this somewhat.
---
Potential motivation: Their belief that Aurene is just as self-serving as the rest of the dragons, and that her supporters are proof of dragon corruption on a different level. Perhaps they don't believe the world's magic is destabilizing, or perhaps they have some idea of mitigating it.
---
Because they replaced marketing with addictive designs...

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.

* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)

---
Well these are... a let down. Not only is it a 2k gem pack for 5 skins, but only 2 (maybe 2.5 if you like the axejaw, but let's not kid ourselves here...) are quality skins, the rest are just filler so you feel like you got your moneys worth...
---
Am I missing something or does this have zero to do with Jim Sterling's points? Like, these are a straight purchase. There's no gambling, these skins aren't even like the mount licenses. You pay something, you get the skins.
---
You can do this even before level 80, but learning thoroughly what your skills and traits do changes so many things. This sounds obvious I know, but it truly isn't. 
---
Other things are gearing, exploring maps, leveling gatherings, clearing dungeons etc, PvP, WvW, can start doing t1 fractals (not sure how hard it gets after that to get ascended items with all them TP restrictions). Just be aware that doing some group content can get spicy with a core ranger.
---
GW2 end game is whatever you make it, since you don't have the expansion I'd recommend checking out Fractals of the Mists. There's 100 levels of increasing challenge and reward to play through there. It'll slowly introduce more mechanics as you complete each fractal (basically a dungeon). You'll need to work your way up to Exotic and then Ascended gear as you go but just doing fractals should get you there. Repeating fractals is normal and a great way to geat some easy loot. 
---
You've also got the personal story to complete, reaching level 80 will likely come before you're done with that so enjoy it! The Orr maps are really cool and have some impressive meta events. 
---
After the personal story you can give map completion a try, go complete every heart, climb every vista and find every point of interest. Map completion rewards have a chance of giving you a black lion chest key! 
---
You can also try making a new character and trying a different class, race and order. The early personal story has plenty of variety and you sometimes get to meet characters earlier on depending on your race. 
---
If you feel like going "old school" you could possibly track down a Dungeon guild and get into running Dungeons, there's a tonne of story hidden in there that is easy to miss and the rewards aren't too bad either. Dungeon tokens are needed to craft some pretty cool gear and even legendary items so check them out! 
---
There's also structured PvP if you're into that, plenty of stuff going on there, you'll be limited to core specialisations though so it might be tough. WvW might be easier to get into with just core specialisations and has a lot of variety in terms of play. 
---
In terms of class builds, don't bother until you've hit level 80, then give MetaBattle a look and see if there's any builds that use a core specialisation. Learn the difference between power damage and condition damage builds while you're at it. Core builds are generally weaker but that just means you'll have to put a little more effort into it. Also don't feel like you have to follow a build exactly, tweak it how you like, use the skills you enjoy, if you want to take your pet pig with you into battle, more power to you!
---
You can buy Living World Season 2 for gems.
---
Maybe valves DotA? Without the microtrans on cosmetics they would presumably have eventually charged people to play, resulting in a smaller playerbase. 
---
Maybe a smaller but more invested playerbase would be "better", but fast queue times and better matchmaking from a deeper player pool is a benefit for most people.
---
they don¬¥t
---
You could use different skins on different characters. At least that's what I do.
---
Is it really that big of a problem?  Why are a few extra tiny steps such a hassle? Does it load slowly?  Maybe I don't get it because it's not slow on my setup. It's a nonissue for me but you seem overly upset about it.
---
&gt;1-player dungeon
---
A thousand times this. Only I want them to have 'actually challenging' mode with rewards. Wildstar (rip) had mini dungeons that could scale to a single person and ESO has the maelstrom arena, both of which allow solo players to get stuck in to a challenge
---
Yea it is like warclaw deal. I play mainly WvW for the last 2 years. Bastion pass was insta buy with real cash... but I wanted just 1 non-helmet skin for Warclaw, witch honestly is ok on 400-600 gem price point not 30 USD purcase of gems.
---
I liked it, is there alonger version?
---
Yeah, was really disappointed that the branded one didn't like have a lightning fire or branded ground kinda thing. :/
---
Many people have but also many people don't. But most people care just about a single skin from a 5pack and being unable to buy them individually is a predatory marketing. I start to believe r/guildwars2 is just full of people with stockholme syndrome...
---
Pass. Forced bundle, all kinda the same - *even* buying one unique skin at 2000 gems looks like a better decision.
---
this is amazing!!!
---
Thanks a lot!
---
WOW.
---
:P
---
I wish those were tradeable. Got thousands still stored since the original release since all the other exchange options were utter crap.
---
Well, yes? Thats my point. The fact that it's the only thing doesn't make this element any better tho
---
Fair point with the detail.
---
&gt;Instead of giving everyone what they want to maximise the number of sales, ArenaNet goes all in on the whales 
---
Practically everyone is doing this, and that is probably because it works. Take Path of Exile for example, only storage is priced for mass sale. Everything else is priced for whales.
---
Thank you for your contribution !
---
With collection items that only have value as part of a collection, are account bound on drop, and have no actual vendor value tend towards requiring the player to type out the name in order to delete the item, yet, for whatever reason, you seem to have a problem having a better system for infusions.  Neat.
---
How about instead of a warning, they just pop out when you have the mastery to use the infusion extractors and just do away with infusion extractors to begin with.  Infusions don't do anything beyond give you a paltry amount of stats and, usually, a sparkly effect.  They cost as much as a legendary and therefore, should have the same treatment as a legendary.
---
D-d-d-DEATHWINGGGGG!? Now I want a Smaug looking skyscale.
---
I was answering someone else's question.
---
See, the thing is, these are items with about as much value as a legendary, so they should be treated as such.  I don't see the problem with being able to just swap out stat infusions on non legendary gear.
---
2k gems to unlock more than one dye channel. /s?
---
Have you considered downloading the Elite Insights parser? It basically lets you parse the logs offline and creates a new file on your pc with the parsed log. You can then sort those files into folders for separate characters and stuff and won't have to worry about saving and organising lots of urls.
---
Where is the cheapest legitimate place to buy expansions at the moment?
---
If you die(full dead), autoloot doesn't work on things you already started attacking.
---
And this npc still gives you shit if you didn‚Äôt pick Vigil way back in the original story. Anet, y‚Äôall got some updates to do!
---
What better system do you need beyond a warning and a confirmation tab?
---
A new brain? I agree. A new brain might help.
---
&gt; How about instead of a warning, they just pop out when you have the mastery to use the infusion extractors and just do away with infusion extractors to begin with.
---
Legendaries...they're a thing.
---
you actually want none of those stats if you're playing renegade, you also never choose that weapon combination for literally anything on renegade
---
Is there somewhere that explains this/things like this? That's I think my biggest problem with picking and learning a build - snowcrows and metabattle list the rotation and maybe some "what ifs" but does a poor job of really explaining the why and when and how of using those skills. So then I try to learn the rotation but something happens in game and I get thrown off and don't know how to get back on track.
---
That‚Äôs weird because for me the order was diffirent. There is no click bait, I repeat, watch the video.
---
What‚Äôs the point of your comment? Lol
---
I'll give it a look! Thank you very much for the suggestion
---
If you play PvE just ignore Scrapper tbh its pretty dogshit
---
 No shame in taking breaks, eventually the itch will come back
---
Karmic retribution from this map + consume mistborn motes for volatile magic.
---
Once a day you can trade 500 of them in one of the fractal vendors for Unid gear. (I doubt we will get a future use given anet added this outlet awhile back)
---
Big fan of the more slender look on the axejaw. Regular skyscale's proportions seem just a bit too chonky to be able to fly that competently. Always kinda bothered me with the club tail, super brolic torso and neck, and then the teeeeeny tiny back legs. The axejaw remedies pretty much all of that imo.
---
Definitely thinking about picking this up for... a singular skin. *cringe* Oof.
---
I love how they capped it to 500 a day for green unids. Like anyone was going to exploit it
---
&gt;I like
---
The music video isn¬¥t that loger itself... but i linked it in the infobox of the youtubevideo
---
&gt; Just because you started playing with friends doesn't mean that everyone else did or does.
---
IMO, and more importantly, **has to**.
---
We had the select license, why remove it? Even here some people want only one skin.
---
Mine too. I like that it's a bit subdued, and that it makes the horns point backwards.
---
"Last night" being the operative phrase here, because now it'll go through the roof again with these skins
---
.......I've got it!
---
Zenos Yae Galvus! That's the MMO you meant, right?
---
&gt; Is it ethically wrong if whales drive the company when its direct item purchases of skins? This video seems unclear on bothering with these distinctions. Jim is a little radical here in his view of things, which is foretold by his intro which turns every activity into an addiction.
---
Depends.  If they have the money to do it, no.  However, a lot of the time these whales don't have the money to throw at a game and end up ruining their lives over getting a quick dopamine fix from opening several hundred or thousands of RNG boxes for shiny items.
---
:)
---
&gt; Or sell the specific skins
---
They would if their economic analysis indicated that'd be more profitable. Unfortunately, there aren't enough small spenders to justify that.
---
OH MY GOD i've always had that setting set to "lowest". I might not be as bad at this game as I thought. =O

By ‚Äúpve‚Äù people mean raids and fractals, obviously anything goes for open world.

Ah, the "I'm older than you based on no information" card, well played.  If you read every word in my last post, I stated my **initial** (that means my first!) post. ArenaNet is doing nothing new here, this is how they sustain the game. They update the gem store every Tuesday. This is how the game stays online. 
---
You come off as the distant older relative on Facebook that posts long propaganda videos and the comments "The truth can't be contained! Spread the word!". I don't like Jim Sterling, I've seen his videos in the past, I'm not interested in his opinion, especially on a 30 minute video. Stop advertising it, move on.
---
You're providing nothing new, simply redirecting to another thread. Keep that conversation there.
---
Mount licenses require designing +20 different skins to justify its existence. Perhaps it was overkill as an option to them to add skyscale skins to the game right now, especially when we already had tge Exotic license a month ago.
---
you have obviously never heard about the mount loading bug, a bug that has been known since PoF launched, and can still only be circumvented by using a skin if you're affected. the "effect on your ability to play the game" this bug can have is in fact so substantial, that will never hesitate to label the warclaw package a straight up p2w purchase. my personal best in that regard is getting stuck for ~15 seconds without exaggeration.
---
That song... was fantastic! :D
---
Snow Crows actually has a lot of information available if you read the class guides! The one for Dragonhunter is [here](https://snowcrows.com/raids/guides/guardian/dragonhunter/power/).
---
He's invariably not, the fat waste of space.
---
It's happened to me twice and  I'm usually extra cautious, but the two times it has happened to me, I thought I was slotting the infusions into my other armor set and the game didn't swap over to it.
---
I'm not talking about buying the RNG boxes. I was asking if its ethically wrong if the whales are buying skins off the store. I am talking about the fancy mount skins, the outfits or things like Balthazar's Helm and Shoulders.
---
I like this interpretation best.
---
Would be nice but you shouldn't expect it and you shouldn't be mad if they don't do that. You got what you paid for and anet isn't doing anything wrong by not giving out free mount skins that would otherwise make them $$$ when sold.
---
New account, statement is also vague, can we have verification on this one?
---
Again, if they can afford it, no, nothing wrong with a whale spending a ton of money on a game.  It's also not entirely terrible for a game company to try to sell DLCs and things like that in a store.
---
I want a Charr-Copter Skin
---
really? it's in writing and mentioned by them? if so, that's really unfortunate to hear :(
---
I hate-hate-HATE that we can't buy individual skins, I only want 2 of these. I get Anet wanting to squeeze every bit of cash out of mount skins and I'm fine with it, I just think there's gotta be a better way to do it without shoving unwanted skins down people's throats.
---
Anet: Makes something where you pay a price and get all five things.
---
Players: IS THIS A GAMBLING?
---
If you select response 1, does she toss out another one, And another?
---
Sorry forgot the /s
---
the only accurate part about this comment is the comparison to the springer, and even that only if you do not consider velocity.
---
that's what i think as well! especially as someone who's been playing for like 5 years, i still never use /wiki in-game purely because it feels awkward to bring up my web browser when i'm just trying to play the game.. same for trying to find guilds, i would imagine it's much more intuitive/ immersion-friendly being able to find guilds advertising in-game
---
Interesting I've never seen his blue circles. Maybe I just don't know what they look like
---
Other than Deimos teleport greens disappearing at the same time, this is my experience as well.
---
Doesnt matter. That part of the story only lasts about 5 minutes anyways
---
Did you advertise group in LFG?
---
A few months ago there was a promo that literally handed out PoF keys for free. If someone's still hoarding a key and reading this post, be a sweetie and make this person a present. Even if there's no more user-hoarded keys left, hopefully my info is helpful for the possible future giveaways.
---
Sadly, not so much. They were just mocking the human way of ‚Äòromance‚Äô compared to the Norn way
---
...what?
---
You forgot to downvote before replying.
---
Did you finally learn?
---
I doubt it. Probably just an error.
---
Try dodging more
---
Check this guide:  [https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/)   
---
There are 2 setups, one using Illusions (greater burst - lesser sustain), one using Domination (greater sustain - lesser burst), each have their own better use but I find myself using mostly the Illusions version because it has better self-buffing capabilities, so when you're playing solo or can't rely too much on boons from your group this build will perform better, also it uses Focus too so you have the pull and projectile defense (Domination uses GS).
---
yeah, what i like about mobs in HoT and PoF are that they even use combo attacks, anti-range tactics or pulls. the problem is that they hurt quite a lot ahaha- if you're not ready for it, you'll get stomped &amp; waypoints in expansion areas are much more spread out so it's quite an adventure getting back to where you were trying to get to.
---
Caudecus did nothing wrong!
---
Thank you for replying to my thread.  
---
So what would be my next step?  
---
I can show the achievement completed with my IGN like someone suggested in this thread. A screenshot of Gw2efficiency page that shows the infusion left my account. Even the search box feature in gw2efficiency showing theres nothing named "Koda's Warmth" on my account. So i can prove, even tho i would be using a 3rd party website, that i had it at some point and that i don't have it anymore, would that be enough to show i'm not trying to dupe the item?
---
Maybe that's what was missing!
---
It's supposed to be locked in time, it's fine.
---
I'm not sure they're making more money this way.
---
Thank you!
---
Please don't tell my secret
---
Oh, I'm sorry, these are on my other character
---
&gt; Unfortunately, there aren't enough small spenders to justify that.
---
There are no small spenders because there are no small purchases in the first place.
---
what's predatory is seeing that people didn't like the warclaw version of this tactic and not letting people play 400 for one each. i bet they would get a lot more money tbh if people could select the skins they wanted for the price of regular single skins. it might not be 400 i don't remember how many gems it is but yeah. 
---
doing this tactic multiple times might get them more money in the end but will sour their reputation with customers as it already has with the warclaw. it's predatory that they clearly ignored feedback regarding the warclaw.
---
at least the first time with the warclaw, people sucked it up because we tend to give Anet the benefit of the doubt. but this time, i genuinely think it's gonna blow up in their faces if they continue to do this. regardless of how good/bad people think the skins look, they should know better than to keep doing this in the first place. one of those skins should've been the base skin for the skyscale because people are going to buy skins regardless.
---
purposely making these mounts with ONE dye channel just so you can sell 2 others that have more dye channels is questionable. throwing those 2 skins + a model change + particle one (that most people are going to get) in a pack altogether without letting you decide which particular one you want is complete bullshit and they deserve every ounce of backlash they might get for it.
---
Who is going to buy 5 skins for the same mount? Makes no sense to me.
---
The warclaw at least had the WvW-only excuse, but the skyscale? It's kinda stupid.
---
Better than raid repeat clears. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
thats just waste of clicking, better to trash it
---
make me think about a dwarf or hobbit song in LOTR , really nice
---
There used to be. Apparently they didn't come through.
---
I'm not surprised in the least, but telling this info to someone complaining about the price today is only helpful as a learning experience.
---
Even if you used 2, that‚Äôs a 400 gem discount. Lol. It‚Äôs 1200 for one. They offer this for better value, because a lot of people do have 9+ characters and thus may use at least 2. 
---
Personally I love having variety; Hell I have like 2-4 outfits on each of my characters. And I have.... 12? So overall it‚Äôs not bad. I am a bit sad these don‚Äôt have much taken from real animals though, as those are my favourites (lop bunnies, salamander raptor, all the pups are great currently using the maned wolf, the orca is cool, etc. )
---
&gt; and the game.
---
Hah yeah right lad. There's a monkey that's been glitching into keeps and portalling people in all week. This isn't uncommon and they never seem to get banned... just bored.
---
Lots of people, probably. My favorite part of game is dressing up my characters and making stories for them, so I love having lots of mount skins to match their personality / outfits / whatever. 
---
People don't have to all play the game the same way
---
It‚Äôs a 0.6x bigger paycheck, not 5x.
---
You assume OP would only lose two days worth of gametime with a roll-back, but the last "checkpoint" could be a lot older than that. To quote [Dornsinger](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6n3178/bad_support/dk7nv1x/):
---
&gt; Sadly, there is no 'auto save' or similar manual process in triggering [roll-back points]. So your last save point might have been five minutes ago - or five months, depending on what happened on the back end of things.
---
In any case,[ they probably wouldn't grant a roll-back](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c80reu/accidentaly_deleted_my_unique_infusion/esm0pwr/) for OP's issue.
---
Please go and follow a tiny asura, as commander in blob vs blob.
---
Or for enemies :P
---
Aren't raids just harder dungeons? I'm new and I dont get the hate.
---
What the dolyak are you talking about
---
&gt; i bet they would get a lot more money tbh
---
I stopped reading right here. You claim they're being predatory to get more money and then claim they could be making more by not being predatory? Just what do you think their motivation is here? Being predatory because they're evil? They're a company that wants money, that is well experienced in what does and doesn't work. They know which one makes them the most: the so called predatory one, which is why so many companies use it. I know we all want the ideal version where we pay only 400 gems for a mount, but that ain't gonna happen. In no world would that ever happen with any company, predatory or not. Even the nicest company in the world would simply not be able to survive with that kind of return on investment.
---
I like the term "rage" for a group of dragons instead of glory.
---
Or a mount for pvp. Not all mounts but one specific mount. For mobility purposes. That would be great.
---
But outside that it makes no sense.
---
TIL üòÖ
---
Remember raid selling is a thing tho :/
---
Be careful throwing around assumptions and speaking for everyone. The disdain for the Warclaw pack may have been loud and clear on this subreddit but apparently it sold well enough regardless to make Anet decide to do it with Skyscale too. Like lots of people said in this thread Anet needs to make money somehow and they know their sales metrics better than any one of us. If you don't like it, you don't have to give them any money.
---
I don't really think I need to explain why comparing murder to buying  loot boxes in a video game is silly. Not to mention that the company who made the knife isn't sitting there on your shoulder offering rewards for stabbing people.
---
TC, this is a new account with no verification whatsoever tho...
---
cant even imagine not having 2k of all map currencies, bless wvw and anets slow update schedule
---
I'm not the one downvoting you bud.
---
&gt;it has nothing to do with "being evil." Literally if they had only considered how upset people got over the warclaw, they could've at least TRIED it with the skyscale.
---
Or, I don't know, the complaints about the Warclaw skins came from a vocal minority and ArenaNet have a way better idea what customers want from the Gem Store than the relatively small subset of players that make up the reddit community do.
---
Fine, instead of murder let's say robs a random guy. Besides you're the ones comparing cosmetic lootboxes to casino gambling.
---
They won't do this, if it in any way shape or form makes it harder to see infusions then theyll straight up never even acknowledge it. Infusions are the only thing that makes them do graphical adjustments anymore, as if there arent things from launch were still asking them to adjust like ele dagger #4 crashing AMD graphics card when zoomed in too close.
---
Counterpoint: there is literally zero reason for the left mouse button to perform only a single attack when auto attack is set to ability 1.  For the incredibly rare time when you need to have something constantly targeted and within attack range, but auto attacking would be detrimental, you can just turn off auto attack.
---
i think you're badly overestimating how many players have a problem with this business model. if someone feels so pressured to buy the newest shiny that they get this upset about a 5-pack of skins, maybe they're the ones who has an unhealthy attachment to the gemstore they don't want to admit.
---
Hidden garden jumping puzzle is behind a really dumb one/series of walls. Is there really a reason to make it so you have to wait for the blasted portal mobs? Or why couldn't they just extend the mountain texture up and make the wall visible?
---
That's pretty much how you do it tho
---
I feel like you just picked out a single word of my comment and ran with it instead of actually analyzing the logic and responding to that.
---
Robbery is still an actual crime that directly causes harm to someone else, so obviously society's going to treat it differently since you're a danger to others. The loot box situation is different in that 1.) it's not illegal and the harm caused to others is mostly indirect, and 2.) you have big company full of people that know how to manipulate people with addictive tendencies actively encouraging you to feed your addiction.
---
i agree with that, but its nicer than getting accidentally killed and having to waypoint if you do happen to get that unlucky
---
"Lmao no." 
---
&gt; Skyscale in the air with dashes is about as fast as Jackal on flat ground with dashes.
---
this statement stops being accurate after the first two dashes.
---
&gt; Skyscale can fly higher than the springer can jump.
---
yes, as i confirmed. however the springer travels the vertical distance quicker. in situations like e.g. getting to the first hydra in dragonfall, springer easily comes out ahead.
---
&gt; Skyscale can fly indefinitely, while the griffon is ultimately limited by speed. 
---
it might require some continuous effort, but griffon is quite capable of flying indefinitely. the skyscale is made for hovering and has a shorter horizontal reach than the griffon.
---
&gt; The only reason to use the Griffon over the Skyscale is if you're doing long distance travel.
---
it's not far behind the skyscale when it comes to traversing terrain that is a bit too difficult for raptor/jackal. griffons descending speed is also faster than even straight up falling by a significant margin.
---
and lastly:
---
&gt; Skyscale beats every other mount in every other scenario except straight line races.
---
to which i reply:
---
&gt; Lmao no.
---
**Ranger Elite Specialization**: Pack Hunter
---
**Profession Mechanic**: Pack Leader
---
In addition to your normal pet and its skills, it gets a 'burst' skill where it summons its pack to help fight for a duration. Afterwards the pet is on cool down.
---
**New Weapon**: Hunter's Rifle
---
Provides considerable ranged damage while reducing cool down on pet skills and summon CD per skill use. Possibly make a trait do this instead.
---
**New Skill Type**: Minion
---
Summon additional pets, weaker than your main pet. Still tossing ideas around for their actives, but probably something that affects your main pet and/or its pack maybe the expense of the minion's presence on the battlefield.
---
**Throw Away Ideas**: Dual Pet, Alpha pet. I've seen similar suggestions even in this thread. The alpha pet could even be in addition I just started brainstorming upon seeing this thread, so I don't have thoughts on balance yet so maybe combining an empowered pet with the pack burst would be too much, but the trade off of a pet cool down could be enough even when mitigated by rifle skills.
---
Dual Pet was actually my first idea looking at the thread. My ideas were you'd get 2 pets instead of 1, but no switching or alternate pet set. I really like the idea of incorporating something in the spirit of the thief's dual wield skills, where depending on the family or maybe the archetypes from the soulbeast, your pet combinations provide unique pet skills or combination of stat bonuses.
---
what i was going to reply to you has become the first paragraph of my original post instead, if you would like to read it

I left Guildwars 2 about a year ago due to the lack of focus and changes in PvP. It is very rough finding a good MMO with a good PvP focus and there hasn't really been a change in the MMO PvP market since I left. I wanted to check in and see if the team has taken the PvP aspect of their MMO more seriously and has there been any improvements since I left the game. Anyone information would be helpful. Thanks for taking the time to look at my post.
---
If you fully participate in  a lane from beginning to end, *and* choose the reward that gives you the keys and currency (Pact Commando Chest, IIRC?), you'll have enough for a majority of pods. I do DS regularly, and hop to every waypoint opening every pod post-meta and can usually open all of the pods that appear at all of the forward and advance camps, at least.
---
You mean the poster that showed RGB channels? lol... that's the most default way of showing color channels in the world of graphics.
---
Wintrades got cheaper 'cause no one cares anymore about PvP titles
---
At this time (2233CEST, 2019-07-02) there are 60,393 people who completed the War Eternal storyline. 43,634 (72.25%) of those decided to try the Skyscale completion and gathered all scales. 24,531 (40.6%) completed their journey to get access to latest mount. That's 6.06 times higher number than 4,046 people that achieved the War Eternal episode "mastery" and access to their Corsair Boots via achievements and not PvP/WvW reward tracks - and having in mind that there is 7,956 people with Corsair boots unlocked, that means that almost half of playerbase registered on GW2Efficiency prefer obtaining Living Story rewards from competitive game modes, and not by playing said Living Story content.
---
Statistics are weird, aren't they?
---
I can't see Kralkatorrik as being good either.  He woke up and immediately killed Glint.
---
Sleeping Kralk, "grr just you wait..when I wake up, I'm going to end you!"
---
Glint, "Sure you will old man."  
---
Awake Kralkatorrik at Glint's Lair, "Knock. Knock."
---
Then OP won't be able to left click.
---
Thanks for the information! :D
---
i respectfully decline that statement... i read every one of your comments and tried my best to articulate my point but now you're just being condescending.
---
Reddit upvotes your own posts automatically.  Do you have this off in the settings or something?
---
You mean "surprise mechanics".
---
How so? You can easily farm best-in-slot equipment for a character using RIBA or Dragonfall in a week, and trinkets in another. The ability to directly convert cash to gold just shortcuts this process and is at best a convenience. GW2 is the least p2w games of this type out there.
---
Lorewise, yes.  Ingame for gameplay reasons, no.
---
Well, that sucks.
---
But how is it gambling in any way, shape or form? There's no chance involved.
---
And for those of us who can't raid (comp is bad enough that mechanics don't show up), the mantle popped up in BSF, did nothing for two chapters and vanished in LD.  I'd have liked to see more.  Lazarus faction mantle just... really didn't do anything and lazzy himself got totally shafted.  Tbh we should have tried to recruit him.
---
Thanks for sharing! 
---
Where is Dulfy?!  :sob:
---
Yes, but then it would require to do core map competition that may scare off some people. 1HP and one point. Then if you don't have fully unlocked other elite classes, you will be in advantage.
---
There is one thing tho, we might get more than one map? This datamined text about demo area. It's definitely not pvp, imagine you have access to half of arena? It's not WvW, because the same, how can you fight if you play on one piece of map. It's definitely PvE. But then, we never got demo areas unless it was really huge stuff like expansion demo, where we could do events within a part of new maps.
---
Either new maps are even bigger or we will get two or three, it's also possible that we might get 10p hero points in core tyria, let's say unlocked only for lvl 80 heroes.
---
Who knows. 
---
  
---
If it looks financially viable I'd be surprised if they didn't. Otherwise I's bst against.
---
Eh, but don't we all know someone like that?
---
Oh, that's pretty neat. Gonna have to put it on my wanted skins list :)
---
Most people play with the standard enemy models option enabled so that wouldn't happen.
---
You haven't, I believe it's still going on for 2 weeks
---
So why not charge 500/600/800 gems for 1 skin and just make a bundle? Because  they know they can't charge more than 300 gems for 4 dye channels. You might use the other skins, but most players will buy the bundle because the 3 meh ones are holding the branded skin hostage
---
We made a jumping puzzle to reach the top then used a Djinn portal.
---

---
Tell what?
---
They won't fix it until it hits them in the gem shop.
---
Your stats are fine but what really makes the difference is your ability to use your build effectively with the mechanics of LWS3.
---
Anet stated, they wanted to talk more about Malyck in HoT but they ran out of time.  So, I don't think his story is dead.  The Maguuma Jungle is HUGE.  There are large portions of the map we have yet to visit.  So, hopefully he'll return soon.
---
I guess I do since I don't care about upvotes or downvotes.
---
Would be nice to get a skin with effects and NORMAL eyes. 
---
Seriously...why does everything with a little bling have burning eyes or eyes that look like you need a permit for lasers?
---
If you turn player model quality down to lowest it will use default models for everyone else, with the exception of weapons, auras, and backpieces
---
lol awesome xD
---
I disagree. Keep in mind that the Elder Dragons are depicted as "endlessly greedy". They're always consuming magic from the ley lines, and the ley lines is the culmination of **all magic**.
---
In other words, the ley-lines themselves are full of conflicting magics unless filtered out. And the Elder Dragons are too greedy to filter out just their one type of six magics. They've been eating that conflicting magic for eons, long before any detail any history book has on them.
---
It also makes sense given that their behaviors seem ultimately unchanged between this dragonrise, and the previous from what records we have, and their behaviors are further unchanged from before Zhaitan's death, other than using new magic.
---
This is part of why Aurene getting Joko's magical powers makes no sense to me (besides it being a cop out to utterly negate the worth of Aurene's death). If the Elder Dragons can get access to new magic by merely consuming it, then why aren't they all prismatic dragons who have access to all types of magic since they're constantly feeding on the ley lines and their victims. Why didn't Zhaitan have magic reflecting all six gods, and why doesn't Primordus have asura portal magic?
---
Complaining about something specific doesn't mean there aren't other problems too.
---
It's actually not about the Elite Spec, but rather Daze mantra enabling stupid things this like, and yes other classes have things like this too.
---
The branded skin could use a special epilepsy warning screen.
---
Guys... the music of the game is nice and cool, especially around Tarir, why do you feel the need to put some obnoxiously loud music?
---
That's how you do it if you already know how to use a scripting program like AHK.  For someone who doesn't know anything about scripting, WaldrianChuk gave a nonsensical explanation that will still need to result in the person doing Google searches, so the whole r/restofthefuckingowl reference is pretty accurate.
---
That being said, a few Google searches really is all you need, it's not like we're talking about a complex system.
---
Well that and all the other stupidly unbalanced stuff mesmer does adds up.
---
Many NPCs have armor skins/outfit that we can't have sadly. The same goes on faces and hairstyles.
---
Welcome to:
---
*Maps stuck in TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME!*
---
This skin pack is garbage . 4 of the 5 looks exactly the same , except for the colors , which is meaningless cause you just dye them anyway. It's exactly like the Warclaw pack.
---
Not OP but, for me, these are simple repaints. You can get a complete overhaul skin for 2k gems, like the jackelope, the lion, the humming bird, or the husky.
---
Sure, you get 4 color patterns but they are all similar and, if you really only want to use one, why not spend the 2k gems on a more drastic reskin instead?
---
Not sure how they can "look into it" since not initiating autoattack on left click is done on purpose...
---
Jackal is super cheap.
---
Do your dailies, and then run Fractals of the highest Tier you can. After about an hour and a half of effort, you'll probably be halfway there.
---
Check your material storage. If you play semi regularly I can almost guarantee you have 30g worth of stuff in there unless you regularly clear it out.
---
If you have a level 50ish character, you can do the Silverwastes farm. 30g will take 1.5 to 2 hours starting from nothing, but you *need to open the bags of gear on a level 50ish character*
---

---
Sure, but it does feel like Mirage has become a scapegoat for everything that's wrong with PvP and everyone who's playing the other dozen broken specs is trying to keep the hate train going so that Anet doesn't pay attention to their specs. *Not to say Mirage or the daze mantra aren't part of the problem* but they are a relatively small slice of the clusterfuck that is GW2 elite spec balance.
---
i use elite insights which has a csv output option. that gets put into an excel spreadsheet which gives me my output to put into the import tab. I can probably get that automated but it doesn't take that long for me to open the csv, copy all, paste, then copy the formatted output to put into googlesheets so haven't bothered. maybe 5-8 seconds per log.
---
Where are we getting the Glint delayed Kralk from?
---
I think he means that buying the shimmering skin is a better choice, because it's 2000 for just one skin , but at least it IS different looking. And he's right. This 5 pack , the skins are extremely undifferentiated , just like the Warclaw pack.
---
Edge of Destiny. She states she defended Kralkatorrik as he slept, before turning against him. This indicates she was put into the herald position. When she left, there would be a void, no different than when the Great Destroyer was slain. That's the delay - whether or not she actively worked to slow his rise as well (which given she spent thousands of years preparing for his inevitable awakening, I'd imagine she'd try to delay it as much as possible, too).
---
Bullshit, every single post here that is somehow positive towards OP is downvoted to shit. That's psychotic. Spare me the excuses.
---
I guess I wasn‚Äôt clear in my post... my bad. It‚Äôs not that I want these skins more it‚Äôs that I wanted shimmerwing to be the only cool skin out there for a little while longer. That‚Äôs my b though not blaming anyone
---
" Does more damage to moving targets" In a game where the combat system tells you to move quite a lot..... Some mob designs seem to be implemented without any thought.
---
You could have also looked at the Datamining Thread that comes up after every patch and would have seen these skins the same day Shimmerwing came out and made your choice :)
---
has timegating gone too far /s
---
Several places , by different current and former employees. Before the lay-off shake-ups , they were barely doing any work on GW2 and were siphoning off devs to work on other stuff while doing the least possible to keep GW2 from entering maintenance mode. That was the point of the lay-offs. NCSoft put a boot up A-net's ass to close the junk side projects and concentrate on GW2 which is popular and profitable. And if you have been playing, the difference between before and after the aly-offs has been dramatic.
---
that's pretty selfish, there are lots of ppl who can't wait for skins they want, like i'm collecting the frosty ones, some ppl want lava/flame skins etc
---
chasing mirage with scourge, in which world it sounds good ?
---
Can you at least try to provide any counter-argument?
---
no, that's just forum speculation

Well sure, ANet was already completely forthcoming about this as soon as they started adding mount skins, it's not economically feasible for them to charge for single skins. It would be nice if they added a way to get these individually if you only want one of them, but they would likely sell it for 1200 gems (based on the mount select licenses), and at that point, buying 2 for 1200 each is already more expensive than just the 2000 for 5.

I'm not going to have an argument about how [shit like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c88r2v/portrait_of_meep_the_second/eskqj7l/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/c88r2v/portrait_of_meep_the_second/eskw6ap/) is not fucked in the head. You wanna excuse this? Go ahead. You fit right in.

You will not receive the chest via autoloot if you are fully dead, to far away or on a mount. So next time make sure to waypoint directly to the center after all gerents are dead and press f on the chest. It is marked with a big box icon. If you wait for the wall to crumble the chest will already be despawned.

Don't forget that Anets way of balancing in Vanilla also contributed to game mode's playerbases being not friendly to each other. Like nerfing a fine or below average skill ( in PvE ) to the ground because it was completely OP in PvP and vice versa. Their balancing philosophy back then was " If its broken in one game mode, its broken in everyone "
---
At least they do some skill splits today.
---
...I automatically need this. Damn, though, that‚Äôs gonna cost a lot.
---
Greedy implementation of what could have been a sure-thing for 400 gems a pop. Hell, I'd have probably paid the 1200 inflated by the gambling-skip bullshit. But 2000 gems when most of us will use the one skin we like the best?  
---
Bear in mind I bought the Shimmerwing with actual cash, so I'm not against supporting the game and paying for something I really like if it's good quality. However, this sort of thing really makes supporting the game difficult at times.

There's someone in the human home instance that says, "That Caudecus the Wise, I like him. Good head on his shoulders, he has."

... Does he? Does he have a head on his shoulders?

I actually always see Asuran commanders, hardly ever see Charr lol
---
extremely strong healer in Condi heave encounters in raids and in fractals it just makes afflicted easy mode.
---
but yeah, certainly not as a DPS spec.
---
New project most likely. GW2 already has its systems designed and they don't translate well to consoles.
---
 So wholesome, love it! Specially that high female voice. It really gives something special to the song. Kudos to that singer (and all the others of course)
---
Have you thought of sharing this on r/MMORPG to show off our awesome gw2 community (and have a positive post for once over there)?
---
So, it sounds like you're saying norn and char are same size in game.
---
Because:
---
Norn is bigger then char lore wise.
---
Char is quite large.
---
Norn can't be larger then char due to tech limits.
---
Norn and char same size.
---
So why don't WvW comms use norn?
---
Delightful! ü§ò

Selling in packs bypassing the gambling option of selling say a 800 gem box with an equal chance for each skin. I.e. Bypassing gambling methods of purchase.
---
This is dope.

What are the single-most sought out classes for each role in raids: Power DPS, Condi, + Support? I want to make one of each so I can always have a character mastered in each of those roles. Right now I have a druid healer with full asc. gear. I was thinking of making a mirage for condi dps, but I am unsure about the power role.

Anything new and unique to gw2. No more gw1 areas.

Small scale conflict, at least for most of the story. Don't escalate even further to *another* apocalypse.

I can see them try to do it but putting down aoes, directional based attacks, and wells are going to be hard to pop quickly like mouse keyboard
---
I hope to god its not a new project after whats just happened it would be completely stupid for Anet to try and make a new game.
---
Oh, not a bad idea. I'll give that a shot!
---
Thanks for the kind words!!
---
What happend and the possibility of new project was and always will be the decision of ncsoft. It's very possible they got told to do something by their owner that has no connection to gw2 at all. They have nothing else to do anyway.
---
If we assume it's Anet's decision to start new thing, it's only reasonable to do something totally new. They can't survive on milking 7 year old mmo.
---
[deleted]
---
Oh, I thought that they had a mount select license rip.  Going to have to wait for one to come out.
---
Explaining break bars would be a good start.
---
NCSoft would have been the ones asking for the unannounced projects to be cancelled. If they did that and then asking Anet to do this they are fucking morons and the same thing will happen. Anet should focus on GW2. People are forgetting Anet survived on GW1 for 7 years. They can survive on GW2. It would be a big mistake to do this. If they get to the size of Blizzard then maybe. I love this company and I don't want to see it go through what it had to earlier this year. Stick to GW2 make it the best MMO ever. MMOs are what Anet best at.
---
If you do the Dragon Bash dailies, it shouldn't take that long to get :D.  Just keep saving.
---
Can I see a log as well? Thanks!
---
Interesting, I'm keeping mine to consume the food for various collections.
---
A lot of people are pointing out that gw2effeciency's population isn't necessarily representative of the full gw2 population, and so the completion percentages may not be accurate.  That is a true, there is uncertainty.  Unfortunately, many people are then using that fact to wildly speculate and draw any conclusion they want.  Unfortunately, that isn't how bad data works.  Bad data doesn't mean you draw whatever conclusion you want.  It means you say, "I don't know", which is often the most scientific thing you can say.
---
Nothing is as fast as KB/M in general but MMOs are easily the closest gap between the two. I play FF14 on PC with controller almost exclusively now because of its nature as a more relaxed game outside of some harder content and its amazing controller layout that lets me play so smoothly. It'll be harder to make work for GW2 just because of speed, and competitive sPvP will be a huge gap between KB/M and controller, but most content will translate very well.

Flip it sideways, infinity  symbol!

You have 68 characters at lvl 80?
---
I'm pretty sure this isn't possible. The only thing ANet can revoke access to is expansion content, anything that's an unlock is permanently there.
---
I only had one comment. Perhaps you are confusing me for another person.
---
could simply be implemented as part of the tutorial story honestly, or even in the open world, like they did with that chest that learns us to dodge-roll.    
---
sounds better than "Read the letter, Cricket!"
---
That'd be wonderful!
---
I am perfectly happy to pay 400-500 gems per new branded skin. I am NOT happy to pay 2k for that plus 4 I don't want.
---
but... Cricket! Did you read them all? :D
---
At edm fests people make totems. I have my inspiration now
---
If they are still hiring people for the implementation it would make more sense to be targeting PS5 and whatever next xbox is called
---
&gt;And anything we do, be that suspending a player, granting an item, changing guild leadership - we base it all on our logs and records.
---
I think that sums it up there. They are going to rely on their logs and data as that is the only imputable source they have. Not saying you would do this but screen shots and third party sites are relay easy to manipulate (story below from my experience), so its really the classic support case of "its not that I think you are lying, but I also can't trust you".  
---
Now for the story.  
---
I worked tech support at a college. We had a student claim that they had submitted a paper before the due date, but the system had lost it. This was a big paper and they had revived a serious reduction in grades due to it being late. It got escalated to me and I started looking into the logs and did not see anything. I informed the student of this and they sent me a screen shot showing the submission on that date (a screen shot that by its appearance would have to have been taken in the past). Now we had been having some serious issue with the product including loss of data, so seeing this I escalated the issue to our vendor. They did some investigating and instructed us to look at the meta data for the word document and screen shot that where submitted. Turns out both where created an hour after the student was informed they didn't submit their paper in time. The student had gone into their web browser's developer mode on the website and changed the HTML code to make it look like the screenshot was a submission made in the past. The thing is if the student really wanted to cover their tracks they also could have edited the meta data of the paper, but they probably did not realize that was a thing. (I also did some testing to make sure the upload and download process kept the original meta data intact)

Will the Exalted Shoulders skin ever come back to BL chests? Do things from the chests usually come back? I was on hiatus when they were in the chests the first time around and I have the mightiest need for them. Please Anet. &lt;cries in fashion wars&gt;
---
That's not how it worked with the warclaw. No guarantee there will be 1200 gem skyscale skins.
---
They're rather asking for a lot, so I assume the pay is going to be quite decent? Yet they had to let a lot of crazy talented people go? This is so weird.
---
can't say no to free loot ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
The only small purchases I remember were town clothes and glider skins. Outifts and mount skins are more expensive.
---
Glider skins are actually incredibly popular and many sell for 400 gems.
---
&gt; This is part of why Aurene getting Joko's magical powers makes no sense to me (besides it being a cop out to utterly negate the worth of Aurene's death). If the Elder Dragons can get access to new magic by merely consuming it, then why aren't they all prismatic dragons who have access to all types of magic since they're constantly feeding on the ley lines and their victims. Why didn't Zhaitan have magic reflecting all six gods, and why doesn't Primordus have asura portal magic?
---
I think it has a lot to do with Aurene absorbing multiple kinds of magic before she was even born. In fact, I believe that it's been said that she's made of the magic she absorbed, and you can see it in her appearance. The other elder dragons probably did not have that advantage.
---
Also I'm pretty sure that Elder Dragons can only absorb unbound magic. Zhaitan doesn't have magic from all 6 gods because that magic is bound to the gods. It's the same reason why they can't absorb an elementalist's spells and suddenly gain elemental power.

I'd just spam traps with my dh and pull him in, this mesmer bitching is just sad üòî

I think you should add in your ticket all evidence you can get. Add your public api key so they can check for themselves in gw2 efficiency. Explain them what is gw2efficiency and how to check the achievements and items,xD. After they have this, they can't tell they  can't check if you have or not the infusion. So, they only have to choose if they want to help you or not.
---
 Remember that for a company the most important is to avoid bad publicity. If you try your best and they have the means to help you then, it is better for them to help you than receiving bad publicity.
---
CC should have diminishing returns in pvp.
---
If it's from employees, it's not speculation.
---
I spent thousands of dollars in game usually I will stop playing as I'm just wasting my money but then I get bored re instal and end up wasting more of my money and feeling terrible. 
---
Late HoT and path of fire is when i really started to lose control of my spending.
---
So, did some testing. GW2 Efficiency cannot track infusions that have been slotted in an item, either that or their search is ignoring them. Now when I look at the item through GW2 Efficiency I can see the infusion on the item I added it to. 
---
What I think is happening is when you slot an infusion in the game it ceases to be an item and rather becomes part of the properties of the item you slotted it into. The when the item is deleted the logs only store the item that was deleted not all of it's properties so there is no way of searching to see if it was deleted. 
---
Either that or they do not have a tool that can readily find an item based off of it having a certain property so they would manually have to go through the player's entire account inventory searching for the infusion or everything they had deleted to confirm that it was not on their account.
---
Ah ty didn't know this!
---
I know its *much* easier to design weapons but the lack of armor rewards is really depressing. We get so many weapon skins nonstop but armor? We might get a new set every 3-4 months if we're lucky.
---
So you're saying there's a chance? :D Time to start hoarding statuettes.
