Exotic is quite cheap actually, you can buy it on TP or from dungeons/karma vendors for example. It's a huge improvement over rare gear.

Interesting pitch, I like it?

Archer-nature freak-nature freak is my favorite class and I agree.

Amazon is a legit seller, yes. As long as you're buying from amazon and not a random seller in their marketplace, you're good to go :) 
---
Polymock is wish #1.  All others are #2 or lower.
---
The wording might be a bit misleading, yes. You can try to get a refund from the support, if you write a ticket.

Arcane gives allies boons on attunement swap too. Keep in mind, though, that protection is really good on Tempest since Tempest has higher protection damage-reduction.
---
i only need 1 more claw kill, i just killed it and didn't get the thing, i realized that i need 1 year to do a 10min event to get that 1k g skin.
---
i think it's interesting too. im not being sarcastic though- i want to know if it really makes a huge difference. i get up to 250 of a material over the course of a few weeks and then sell it for a payoff of.. 1-5 gold? except ectos and brandsparks i didnt know anyone was making any kind of dollar off of mats in 2019

My main norn elementalist wear the same clothes since one year now. I photobomb everytime i can. The colors are just reverse for me. ^^

You aren’t required to follow a build or rotation to play the game’s content. It is true that Snow Crows builds are frequently referenced and advocated because they spend a lot of time figuring out how to play most effectively, but you can come up with your own skill rotations if thats what you want to do. Theres even a training golem in the special forces area where you can practice and see your dps.

Is it better to salvage crappy weapons and equipment you find, or is it better to sell them at the trading post? And is there a guide to the Mystic Forge anywhere online?

I'm not sure how you'd heal without taking Elemental Bastion since you don't have staff.

You might want to check if you have your ports open and GW2 allowed through your firewall.

Roy, i love you
---
Mmh, I see. I thought the Istan event trains are the way to go atm. There's none of my friends left in game, it's harder than I expected to catch up to everything that has changed and is going on.  Anyways, thanks!
---
So for that guy u think that there should be an lfr automated category for "experimental" builds only and not the free system we have now where he can specificaly ask what he wants? 
---
I'd say they are about the same to be honest. Give the [core guardian](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Radiant_Hammer) a try. 
---
Gearing for sPvP costs almost no resource. Just need to get your hands on some white rarity weapons. Stats are normalized to 80. Stat combinations, runes and sigils are all picked using the sPvP builder. Some runes cost money to unlock but they aren't always necessary. The best way to test out a class is to make a level 1 character and try it in unranked pvp. 
---
A face vs a head armor slot. That would be awesome. Helmets with facegaurds would just hide the face item, and the face items can have no stats.
---
I want to meet my ancestor, from original Guild Wars or a place to rest like in the Eden. 
---
Not everyone got flipped though. The Festive Dolyak of Rata Sum is still making its patrols from the LA asura gate to the Department of the Arcane Eye.
---
Raids are deffently puggable (idk why u think they arent). They can be cleared with experimental builds that have some logic and sense to their design i assure you. But if u wanna run a healer thief with soldier stats kind of build not even the training dummy (with the aoe dmg) will be easy enough for you. So in that case u dont just ask for an easier raid..u ask for another mode completely
---
Given that it's the only thing dealing with GW1 lore and not the "*Tixx, Toxx, the toys ran amok*" plot, not surprising it's seen as the most unique thing.
---
That's when Episode 5 goes live.
---
[This guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) should explain. The main idea is that ascended is only required for high tier fractals, all other content can be cleared with exotic, you just have to learn your class and the encounter. If you have access to LS3 (or you're willing to farm to unlock the appropiate episodes), farming for trinkets will give the biggest impact, or from laurel/guild commendation vendors. That is followed by weapons and lastly, armor. Although you can get ascended items from achievements, I'd suggest only getting the weapons from specialization collections and crafting your first armor set (you'll need to max the appropiate crafting profession) with whichever stats are the cheapest and then [stat swapping](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) it to the desired stat combination.

I mean a MAJOR shake up.

you do realise he doxxed, stalked and threatened to kill people, right? doesnt that make it seem more likely this is all bullshit? youre basically saying any murderer could apologise and promise to be better and you would instantly believe them and label them as courageous and honest, because to you it's the "right way to be"? get a grip on reality mate. not everyone has good intentions.

The skin looks kinda meh though, like they just 2 existing ones mashed em together then turned up the existing glow.
---
What are your thoughts on the Water Spirit trend with fractal druids these days (regardless of instabilities)? I play druid from time to time in fractals and almost never bring water spirit. Just wondering if the meta changed while I’m not looking. 
---
you mean just as you have nothing to negate my points with? I mean you are more then welcome to watch youtube videos for 6 years back, after they get told about strafe their life change and they are happy. That is something to negate about whilst you have nothing yet. 
---
And if you do not understand what i mean with clunky movments then i begin to wonder if you ever actaully only played with turn? Because no matter what we know today is not for new players. Giving them smoth movements whilst learning the rest will be in favor for the player. 
---
Anyway this is pointless i can not agree with you and you can not agree with me, so i leave at that.

I \*ragequit\* at 490 points when we were down by 300. (190-490) We also had \~2 players downstate which is +10pts aka game was over.
---
I don't ragequit games 99.99% of the time. Today was a lot of losing. It doesn't justify anything I said, but I am also subjected to people who \*\*intentionally\*\* stream-snipe me and either harass me all game, or, run around into enemies spamming 1 for free. It happens very frequently, so much so that there is a guild actually made to do so with burn accounts. Sadly these players log in every day and aren't punished for their actions regardless of countless emails with proof to CS.

I'm a human being who can only take so much.

I've done a lot for the community with guides, consistent commentating of high-rated ATs and have done so for the last year or more. I've created more than enough educational content for players and I would like to think that my positive influence in those places outweighs your 2 minute experience of me at the end of a 6h30m stream where I was triggered.

It's up to you if you'd like to give my live stream a chance once more - Or, just watch my videos. At least there you wont have to deal with anything other than positivity.

Hey don't worry about heat management. The best talent for managing heat removes most of the negatives for overheating, and replaces them with lots of positives, so the goal is fill the bar up, let it drain, then fill it up again.

I might experiment with something like this in the days to come.  I think that pugs tend to under value having a 3rd or 4th "DPS" player.  Fractals tend to be much, much cleaner when you have a Chrono that can do 10-15k+ DPS.  Often times with most average groups only having 2 DPS causes uncomfortable bottlenecks with phase-timings and having another support/DPS that *isn't* doing 3-5k is far more helpful than excess healing.  
---
Woah are you serious?! That's ridiculous D:&lt;
---
Still need more data to figure whether Runecrafters or Silver-Fed are better for cracking rares with upgrades.  Getting a few more symbols and charms moves the needle a good amount and there's still a +/- 4% error bar on that salvage rate for Runecrafters.

I do too. It has kind of a joker look to me.

Obviously if you want to win a tournament you need to make time for it. It's rigged because it's at an inconvenient time for you? What kind of dumbass logic is that? LOL
---
Whoo! Looking forward to seeing you there, then &lt;3 I'm super hyped for this month, since it's the first time I'm doing a Dragon's Stand (half?) completion instead of the meta. It'll probably be rusty, but fun all the same :D
---
Not exactly new, people been theorizing an fb posting here on reddit since the last balance patch. I understand pushing for tempest in fractals sadly most pugs will still pick the old true and tested, until that sh*t gets nerfed to the ground, nothing changes. And cuz I'm sure the OP really wanted to change people's mind.
---
So I've been struggling to craft this bitch's ascended set? Evil Asuran
---
I came from Swtor, not WoW, but I like GW2s lack of grind.  Easy leveling and a pretty comfortable end game.
---
I always forget that the first 3 are "1" raid lul, my bad
---
It's shallow vapid and unnecessary.
---
The grind only starts when you start wanting fancy shit.
---
Druid and Chrono are the main supports. Others are widely accepted as offheals. 
---
I would rather see new maps, or even new pvp modes like capture the flag rather than more tournaments. 
---
A Trading Post rework to make it less of a hassle to use. Allow us to increase a buy order price without having to cancel and remake. Have more options in one tab instead of hiding in drop-down menus and other tabs.
---
More specific categories and an option to show either buy or sell price - or even both.
---
The ability to list/buy more than 250 at a time.
---
I'd also love it if we could readjust the price of a sell order without having to pay the fee again. 
---
Water 3+4+5, Overload, and Wash the Pain Away. Not taking Elemental Bastion just means the heals have to be reactive rather than passive from auras.
---
So chronos would be more sought after than the druid and firebrand?
---
While it was indeed fun, people just kept coming back for the daily as it was 1 free gold for no effort (takes less than doing the actual dailies) rather than the fun of it.
---
Im sure anet will give us more stuff like this since this event was very welcomed by the community but there has to be some incentive for people to repeat it, preferably the same, make it a daily  and award a small amount of gold.
---
So I got to Plat and I'm just now encountering a certain Ranger build that can literally one shot me (20k with a single hit). 
---
Can someone give me a link to said build so I can study it and learn how to deal with it please.
---
I’m not sure. Dragon has so many lore and skin options in its own right I want a unique mount - maybe it could have another special function, like being able to use its dismount attack from high above, or use it twice to light the whole battlefield on fire. I would say permanent flight, but with invisible walls and skills on a griffin there isn’t much further we could go. Still, being able to fly over a whole map easily would be awesome 
---
I don't even do my regular dailies half the time...
---
There are too many possible dragon skins to just be for griffin. Maybe four legged dragons could fit the griffin skeleton but what about two legged dragons that also walks on its wings? That would make a cool dragon mount itself
---
The standard raid comp is 2x Chrono, 2x Druid, 1x Banner Warrior, 5x Generic DPS.
---
Some fights are different depending on the mechanics, and you can easily drop a druid for a Firebrand or Herald.
---
But that's the default.
---
Sounds good, thanks for the info!
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/druid/healing/
---
Chrono is equally or more sought-after than druid but its constantly nerfed/changed and in my opinion requires more boss knowledge in general(cause 1 of the 2 chronos ends up being the tank in some encounters, etc), so stick with druid
---
You could try Scourge necro - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPFU28vh5vY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPFU28vh5vY) 
---
The great guilds are the small or medium sized ones which people go to voice comm. find one like that and you will be set
---
&gt; I did T1-4 (except the 19 wins left) in this season.
---
That’s so hardcore! Are you a PvP only player? I did T1-T4 (partial) in the previous two seasons, then finished T4 super casually this season. I was feeling major burn out from last season. There’s also the psychological hurdle of dreading 6 wins/day and 3 class wins made me procrastinate further. 
---
My first PvP toon was a support FB. Got good with it too but after my duo queue friend left the game it was hard to solo queue FB in Silver. So I switched to Spellbreaker. 
---
Got good with Spellbreaker until I reached Gold. My high latency (350ms) begins to rear its ugly head and it was increasingly difficult to land melee hits. So I switched to playing Ranger. 
---
At first I played Boon Beast but later found my calling as Druid. I prefer bunker builds and since I play druid in PvE managing CA skills was like second nature to me. So druid became my main for a bit. 
---
Unfortunately I still needed 3 class wins. A friend suggested I give Core Guard a try but I was reluctant as I already have FB to count for Guardian wins. Plus I wasn’t comfortable playing a glass cannon on my high latency. But then I was dreading to solo queue FB so I said fuck it and give Core Guard a try. 
---
Tried it a few times in Unranked, got insulted because I was bad. Then I joined Tournament as Core Guard and my “Any” pug was pitted against a plat party. Although my team lost but holy shit I was able to hold my own in 1v1. I wrecked their soulbeast so hard. 
---
After that tourney my confidence in playing guard increased a hundred fold. I started climbing in Ranked and core guard was the sole reason I went from Silver2 to Gold2. I especially love that it hard counters DE and rangers. This season I made it to Gold3. Might be able to reach Plat if I put my heart to it but I’m so burned out lol. 
---
Then I’m at T4 of the collection and Spellbreaker was an obvious no go because of high latency. I needed something ranged. After trying various classes I settled with Mirage, because compared with other classes, I was least bad at Mirage heh. 
---
It was awful. I got toxicity from both allies and enemies. I kept thinking like “If only I was on my guard, this would be so easy! If only I was on my guard, I could counter this! If only I was on my guard, I could cleave them all!” Dropped from Gold2 to Silver3 and thankfully got my 10 wins soon after. 
---
Then I worked on Ranger wins and once that was done it was time for Guard again. Steamrolled my way up to Gold3. If it wasn’t for Core Guard, The Ascension collection would’ve been much much harder for me. Love my Core Guard so much I’m considering making a WvW roaming equivalent xD 
---
At the moment the prize pool is sponsored by ArenaNet. Essentially the Account names of those who place 1st/2nd/3rd are sent to ArenaNet and they mail those rewards directly to the account. I wanted the rewards to be consistent and not fluctuate month on month, but perhaps I'm considering a series of giveaways during moments of downtime during the MCT. This could make use of volunteers donating to the cause (if they wish). 
---
I'll look into it!
---
You do realise that this is a player-made initiative, and unfortunately I can't design and release a new gamemode or map. I'm working with limited resources to make something fun for the community.
---
To each their own.
---
For Raids, if your in a static and uses 2 healers u really only need 1 druid and you can play as tempest/fb/ren/herald/scrapper/scourge as a 2nd healer. A case may be made that heal scourge/tempest and herald/ren are doing much better due to the recent meta changes.
---
For Fractals, sadly druid is king and most CM+t4 pug grps won't take anything else as it gives the best buffs.
---
Everyone’s gonna say do this or do that but if you never want to worry about finding a group the Druid is the safest bet
---
That's why they give you that whopping starting discount of 69 dollars price for a trade in, to entice you pay the extra 50 trillion.
---
The elite specs are legit the only reason I’d buy the expansions :/

The best map completion leader! Last time was a blast. 
---
So you gonna explain to the class how this player run event is gonna do that?
---
I've spent on nearly 60 or so keys trying to get those things on each release. The drop rates are abysmal. Never spent a dime on a key but having spent that much effort into it to come out empty handed? Really demoralizing. So much that I haven't even bothered this time around despite the gecko looking really awesome.
---
As you've noticed, the GW2 community is quite psychotic when it comes to raids. For whatever reason, the developers share that state of mind and are incapable of evolving beyond 2004-level of raid design.
---
There might come a day when the game finally gets dragged to 2020, but so far raiding in GW2 is barely more than a tacked-on afterthought, barely supported, and populated by crazy people.
---
My husband and I have been getting into it. I boosted my characters; my husband is leveling and around 30. Seems like he has to bounce between zones a lot or hard farm events to be appropriate levels for hearts, and is hating it. Is that the norm? Or what makes the leveling better around 30?
---
I bought both expansions off Amazon yesterday for $15 a piece, and they both worked fine. Took maybe 5 minutes for Amazon to give me the codes, and after that I was good to go.
---
Hair accessory colors too loud
---
It is. Black Lion Salvage Kit and Upgrade Extractors were fine with their original pricing during the original system of sigils and runes, but now with the change, it's absolutely more on the milking side to cashshop-sell a 100% chance salvage kit, while everything else has 80% tops. That's neither convinience nor cosmetic, that's a significant difference in strength.
---
You shouldn't try to control your ~~children's~~ character's life choices
---
[...](https://imgur.com/a/CMtzeuY)
---
Yeah I figured the drop rates were astronomically low. I set my standards so low for the BLCs that I'm just happy to get Statuettes, so this was a pleasant surprise for sure. After watching a streamer I follow drop over five figures on a CS:GO gambling addiction years ago and watching my friends throw money down the shitter on H1Z1 crates, I'll likely never pay for them. Too much risk for almost guaranteed no reward.
---
Are you in NA? If you are I highly recommend Friends vs Dungeons (FvD). It’s rather active in chatter and acts like a LFG within the guild itself.  There’s also the added bonus of it being a dungeon focused guild, so there’s always players running dungeons everyday. 
---
Huh, not bad. Congrats. I'm working on a few keys myself right now. Last week was mostly shit. Maybe this week will be blessed by RNGesus.
---
Should I be playing with auto attack on weapon auto or should I make it a habit to stop?
---
Reccomendation for him, map complete. It gives you decent amount of xp, and youll always be above the lvl than the upcoming map. You also dont have to be same lvl as the heart, few lvls lower is k. And events are the main ow content in the game, so do them. 
---
I wish pvp got a revamp
---
You NA or EU? 
---
I just want to be good enough at raids to do them, I just suck too much. It's the only content I haven't done at least one of. This is going back to beta era, too. Legendary, all stories, all dungeons (all paths), every fractal at least once, maxed mastery rank, pvp, wvw, 100% map (vanilla, HoT, PoF, all LS eps), all jumping puzzles, all mini-dungeons, Vale Guardian a single time, I just wish I wasn't garbage at raids.
---
Engi has good DPS builds as both condition and power damage options. Last time I checked sword/pistol power uses the fewest kits (just the grenade kit).
---
Sadly no skins for kits/turrets.
---
Mind all these game of the day videos are on his SECOND channel when you go looking. And yea they are a fun watch.
---
I guess you must hate dancers in most games.
---
Pre hot but post and during season 2 was an interesting time. You could actually pug Arah and everyone was good at dungeons, or finding and exp group wasn't hard. Early on I had multiple groups who spent 6+ hrs on p4 and never even got past lupi. True hell. But suddenly people could actually do content and you didn't mind the undergear non try hards because for the most part content become doable, still a struggle, but you could carry. 
---
I feel like this change has carried over, sure people can be bad with specific mechanics but they understand dodging, etc.
---
Most of the xp comes from dynamic events.  You have to slow down and talk to npcs to get them kicked off sometimes (the orange events that are indicated on the map).  If he is missing those, then leveling will be slow and much less exciting, and he will be trying to play gw2 like wow instead of gw2.  Be patient, follow npcs that are going somewhere, and wait a bit to see what they do.  
---
For a minute I thought it was Jean Simmons.
---
Don't do just the map events. You get XP for literally everything. As others have said, do map completion. Do exploration. 
---
Crafting also helps. When running around trying to level, try to stock up on food, pick up a boost from guild hall or hero flag (or xp equivalent). 
---
Trust me, if you’re wandering the open world there’s a good chance someone on the map is in FvD and can try to see if someone can invite you in. Although unless it’s a Guild like that I’d highly recommend sticking to small/medium sized guides where everyone is chill and friends. I myself have been trying to build a small guild in a similar manner though things have been slow. 
---
IIRC Necromancer is all about summoned foes.
---
Ranger has pets and a summonable worm but it's not considered as useful in end game IIRC compared to something like Druid or Soulbeast, the specializations you can get through the expansions.
---
As for Max level characters, GW2 end game content is actually pretty expansive.
---
For starters once you own Heart of Thorns or Path of Fire you can get specializations for your class of choice. Masteries become unlockable (which in Path of Fire primarily consists of Mount skills like Raptor or Jackal)
---
Speaking of which, the Mount system in GW2 I would say is very much inspired by Metroidvania games, as instead of being a speed boost it literally opens up new portions of certain maps. For instance the bunny hops super high, the manta ray thing can float on water, sand and lava, and the Jackal can use sand portals and make multiple mid air jumps, giving you a way to hop across certain hard to reach platforms.
---
Could not agree more.  I ...like you, was in the same boat. Been playing GW2 now for about a month and it's fantastic. What they did with the mounts is amazing. 
---
The people are great, and have not had one bad experience yet. 
---
I tried boosting a character but ended up picking up where I left off 4+ years ago...(almost through the main story at lvl 80)
---
Now I've finished path of fire and I look forward to fully catching up and getting into fractals.  The Ascended gear and weapons are a really fun goal to work on.  I could go on and on!!   People should give it another try for sure!!
---
Coming from WoW to GW2, you will quickly realize one thing.  Evade button is life.  It completely ruins other mmo’s for you that don’t have something similar.  
---
It’s crazy to think about all the time spent in Wow battlegrounds/arena just wishing that you could dodge obvious attacks, but just having to eat then since there wasn’t a pillar to LoS.  
---
This is also true in raids, where you have to actually dodge things and play actively, instead if standing in a safe spot and wailing on the boss while staring at your agro meter and staying below the tank.  
---
It's kind of a long list starting out with the fact that Legion, the previous expansion, was really good. Imagine having two years of a good expansion and then losing all of your fun stuff. They took away the things we liked and replaced them we things we didn't like. We had to level up again, but got absolutely nothing new for our classes.  Just stuff removed. They put more abilities on the global cooldown making game play feel slow and boring. They doubled down on randomness for gear acquisition. They took away tier sets of armor where you could wear one set of armor that gave different buffs depending on which spec you were in. So suddenly, if you like playing more than one of your specs, you had to now collect high level versions for every spec. And even different sets for the same spec (single target vs aoe). And the only way to get that gear was hope for a random drop from boss. They took away master loot - where a guild could hand out loot to whoever they want - which angered serious raiding guilds who put serious thought into prioritizing gear upgrades to better handle progression. Sorry that's just a short list really and not super well organized because I'm doing RIBA farming atm :D
---
He boosted a toon and felt that. I boosted two and am loving it. Granted, I played at release then now, so I had a frame of reference... so I’m explaining most things to him. Slowly. Carefully. That is how a life is taken. 
---
He’s figured that one out. He’s better at waiting for the next event or talking to NPCs than me!
---
In game time is UTC-0, CST is UTC-6 :) So you can subtract 6 from in-game time to get the time-zone you're in!

Huray Huray, its no longer wintersday!

We need to find a guild. I’ve sent him stuff from crafting to encourage him to; might have to sit him down and show him the perks of crafting. 
---
That’s him. He boosted to 80 and was overwhelmed. So was I, but I’ve played before and researched my way to a decent understanding. 
---
Except WvW. That’s an endless hellscape to me still. 
---
He had a blank stare at three of the starting zone names, so I think that’s the case. Time to show him some portals, methinks. (Or to scroll out on the world map...)

They should be more specific. This is a support elite spec with multiple ways to grant protection and the trait that reads "Protection has increased effectiveness."

Having another Spotter and Glyph of Empowerment is probably better than having an off-meta support in your 2nd group.

Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. I haven't done the dungeons before so I'm not confident enough to run a group, and there's no groups advertising for new players. I can read all the guides about how to gear up and do the bosses, but the actual joining a group in GW2 is awkward, mostly because the regular players have moved beyond the early dungeons. I also joined a couple of guilds that advertised they helped new players with early level dungeons, but they never did.
---
I used to run raids and dungeons in BC and WoTLK long before there were any group or raid finders and there were always other groups to get into for all sorts of content. That kind of stuff seems to be missing from GW2 and the gap between fresh level 80 and dungeons is tricky to cross.
---
&gt; When I go back, being rooted in place during long spell cast animations just feels so janky when compared to dodges blocks and movements.
---
Amen to that.  It's frustrating, but GW2 has literally made WoW unenjoyable for me.  I used to play a resto/balance druid from Vanilla through WotlK.  At the time, coming from FFXI, WoW's combat felt super fast paced and ultra dynamic.  And Druid was the pinnacle of it all!  Hybrid city with more abilities than any 6 classes combined in FFXI.  
---
But now, when I try to play Druid or any WoW class after GW2, I want to rip out my hair.  I fall asleep during a 2.5 second Starfire cast time.  Standing still and chain casting them feels SO boring, and each spell feels like it takes an eternity to cast.  
---
I, too, am looking forward to classic (I was just like you, a super hardcore raider from vanilla through Wotlk, then casual thereafter).  But knowing this, I'm afraid even that will prove too boring and slow for me to handle.  My enjoyment of it will rest on nostalgia's shoulders alone.

Also, my god how much better is GW2's open world map completion and event system compared to quests?  When you've played MMOs for 15 years and have completed what must be over 15,000 grocery list quests by now like I have, each new quest I receive drains a little piece of my soul.  Sure, all MMO open world leveling gameplay can be broken down into the same 5 or 6 categories, but it's all about how the game's system disguises the monotony and how organic it can make it feel.  WoW's quest system was fantastic during its inception, compared to its predecessors, like Everquest and Ultima Online.  WoW even did a heck of a lot to evolve and improve the quest system.  But at this point, there's no evolution that can make it feel better than events and natural exploration.  Quests themselves are just outdated relics that are extremely difficult for me to enjoy anymore.   
---
Did you level or boost? Because the game does teach you a lot of things. Every time you level up there's a pop up window with buttons that you can press on to learn more about different elements of the game. It won't teach you literally everything but most of the basic stuff. 
---
As for raids and stuff, you just have to learn it like everyone else by jumping in. That said I highly suggest you take the time to level at least and maybe play all of the story chronologically because the content gets progressively more challenging. It'll give you lots of time to learn your class. 
---
Aside from that, use the /wiki command to look up almost everything. Use the Snow Crows website for raids, Godsofpvp for pvp, and Dulfy for guides. Definitely also join some guilds where you can ask questions. Plenty of people will be willing to help you, you just need to reach out. 
---
Everything I hoped that link would be.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Welcome to the game   We have had a lot of WoW refugees join our guild.  They played mythic plus in WoW so they’re interested in fractals.  I’m teaching them how to run fractals now. 
---
If there’s anything I can do to help you out let me know. I run dungeons and fractals. I also lead HoT and PoF HP trains to get elite specs.
---
there u have the video they made couple months ago: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WM-pKVHvfUo confirmation of the season 5 in 2019, so maybe the new expansion will come in 2020.
---
happy new year :)
---
I support hard levelling as I think the world is wonderful to explore first time around. 
---
That said I would still recommend running a utility and a food buff for experience. It would mitigate that slight stall your husband appears to be feeling without skipping the process entirely! Good luck to both of you!!! :)
---
Oceania or SEA servers.
---
&gt;Add exclusive, appealing, Fractal Relic heavy rewards
---
You do realise these potions *were* originally that ...
---
I'm just gonna wait patiently for you complain about the Fractal God buff now
---
Possibly the SB cheese build of Sic Em + Maul (Greatsword). There are a couple of YouTube PvP clips that show it in action.
---
I haven’t played WoW in awhile, but I miss that level of involvement in a game.  For awhile going back to D3 was scratching my RPG itch, but I’ve played it to the point where I’m burnt out on the game.  Tried getting into PoE, and it just wasn’t for me.
---
GW2 has been sucking me in the last week, I’ve only hit 30 on my warrior, but the game is really starting to click with me. The story is pretty good (and I’m really looking forward to getting to the expansions as I’ve read it gets way better). 
---
My only regret is that I wish I had of boosted each class to 80 just to try them all out.  I’m really enjoying the warrior though, just not sure how much I’ll enjoy banner slave in fractals/dungeons.  But that’s what alts are for I suppose.
---
Unless you get into really big jobs, like pushing orb at KC, or kiting Flak in Sabetha. Being the backup healer is easy, being the main mechanic guy is difficult
---
It's become pretty rare that I run across a group that knows what the defiance bar is. About a third of the time when I mark a target it will be the last thing to die.
---
The Runecrafter's Salvage-o-matic is a great Gem Store purchase if you don't have any of the existing unlimited use salvage kits, and still a good one if you do.
---
Kiting is really not all that difficult (and most groups I have been in have opted to exchange the second druid for a scourge kiter instead), and pushing on KC gets easier the better your group is at DPS (less rifts to push into). 
---
What I do find to be a lot more difficult is pushing on Soulless Horror and kiting (+greens) on Dhuum. A lot more rides on you. 
---
Hi, I've levelled 10 characters now to 80 without boosts. I've done all the ways mentioned - hearts, map complete, etc. And the fastest one by far has just been killing mobs.
---
Get a guild with the +10% exp, but some strawberry ghosts (+15% exp) and a utility food (+10%), then get a black lion booster for laurels and a celebration booster and stack those all together. It'll be around +285% exp gain. Then go out and kill yellow mobs or mobs that are out of the way that aren't tied to heart quests. You'll quickly learn which ones I'm talking about.
---
It scales per level, but with all the boosters on its about 15-25 kills/level. How fast can you kill 25 mobs? 
---
&gt; Do exploration.

You wanna run with my krewe, huh?

Rock Tyria and hunt dragons like I do?

Play me in WvW, and maybe I won't beat you,

But that's okay, because my buddies are there, too!  
---
*What?*
---
It's all about the guildies!
---
Costing them what exactly? In the last decade there are only a small handful of MMOs that have lasted beyond a year with meaningful populations and continued support. GW2 is 6 years old, going on 7, and is intensely more populated than nearly any MMO short of WOW and FF14, with ongoing support and meaningful narrative that people enjoy. In the meantime where are the PVPers? Split across a dozen or more failed MMOs and whining about the death of PVP on reddit, even as they stalk dark subs like Crowfall hoping blindly for a return to UO's free for all looting madness.
---
" GW2 had a problem with group content"
---
I can't agree here, group content isn't that great because of the 'meta' being to much important i played gw2 for 6 years and the game was way more enjoyable the first few years (maybe because i wasn't tryharding at that time)
---
Stay in tier 1 fractals dude
---
Its worth every dollar.
---
“The Bloody Legion” lol 
---
Wow I've never noticed the detail on those gloves. Beautiful.
---
Congrats on finishing!
---
Maybe they've heavily retooled it, but every character I leveled easily outpaced the recommended level of the hearts.
---
Make sure he's doing the personal story missions, and remember that your race's zones aren't the only ones. Asura can finish Metrica, then hop over to Caledon, before heading north to Brisban, and after that's finished, hit up Kessex. By the time those 4 are done, a character should be ready for Gendarran, and from there you've got Lion's Arch and access to any zone you like.
---
Similar "sideways and up" map paths exist for almost every race. Just keep in mind that there's a lot to do in the maps, they're not just corridors from point A to point B.
---
The kit is designed to have more chances at charms and symbols.
---
&gt; Then you die. And do it all over again.
---
What they're saying is, WvW *isn't* a hellscape... It's just practice for Purgatory.
---
&gt; check your graphics options. there should be a ui scaling option if you really want huge intrusive ui.
---
&gt; 
---
I was more referring to character models and whatnot seeming small relative to the environment.  So if I'm fighting like a hero challenge and there's a lot of particle effects around it it can be hard to tell if he's doing something I need to dodge or not.  
---
&gt;everyone I've ever seen playing wow has had their screen cluttered with a huge amount of ui
---
I preferred the strictly minimalist approach myself, other than a cd tracker (because, objectively speaking it's better to have important information near the middle of your screen).  Even then a small box with a number and icon in it is more than suffecient.
---
&gt;I am a delusional maniac who thinks maps should be in the top right
---
me too good sir.  mmo maps top right, moba maps botom right.  That is how it has always been and how it will always be.
---
Meh, balance is still wonky and conquest is still boring, community can't fix that
---
I went from WoW to GW2 in 2013. It really has a lot to offer new players, and it was my main game through to 2017. It’s changed a lot and not my go-to anymore but I’m glad you’ve found what it offers and hope you enjoy the hell out of it. 
---
Make PvP rewards better, in a way that helps to get as much money as PVE farming.
---
&gt; Anything in specific you enjoy about gw2?
---
Just about everything. A couple things here and there are a huge miss for me and I'd love to see a complete rework but I don't expect them to happen.
---
I wouldn't mind a bit more character customization, though. I don't mean hair and face and armor skins.
---
I'm talking about one of their original ideas for the game. Each weapon skill was customizable. Each weapon would offer a few skills and you'd pick them out. But they scrapped that idea really early on. Same for traits altering your skills though some of those have made a comeback, like Dhummfire or the Daredevil dodge traitd.
---
I'm interested - what BS are you referring to?
---
&gt;Never spent a dime on a key but having spent that much effort into it to come out empty handed
---
Just because you don't LIKE what you get, doesn't mean you come out empty handed. You get plenty of things with every single key. 
---
Big WoW addict since 2005 here. I've played every expac, and while I haven't given up hope on BfA (its only just started), I did get jaded pretty quick with 8.0.
---
Unlike WoW, GW2 has actually *built* upon its end-game. When arenanet adds end-game content, it will always be considered "current." Raids and interesting zones don't become defunct content every expansion.
---
Lots of activities from the vanilla game are still considered end-game content years later, and are often worthwhile to do. The game *never* gets smaller, just bigger.
---
I think the level design, in many ways, is superior to WoW. The first time I experienced Orr, I was blown away (I wonder how Nazjatar will compare). Also, I've never experienced anything akin to the maguuma zones in another mmo. I'm always blown away by what the map designers at arenanet come up with.
---
The only *true* gripe I have with GW2 is that it's terribly optimized. Just give me 60fps+ and I'd have a harder time getting tired of the game.
---
Also Canach is Bender and Taimi is Jimmy Neutron
---
No skins for skills or anything like that. Holosmith is the main damage spec (from PoF) there are builds with low and even no kits that only lose small amounts of DPS. [Metabattle has the kitless version](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Holosmith_-_Power_DPS_No_Kit) posted and you can find the other details on builds on [snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/holosmith/power/) though all of this relates to waaaaaay late game. It will also matter the game mode you want to play as the builds change a lot for PvP and WvW. In the mean time you can pretty much do whatever you enjoy while leveling and worry about the end game builds later.
---
I really really miss alliance battles myself and I think it's a really obvious missing link in Gw2. I think there is implicit fun to be had at the 16-player aside mark, because with that many people a zerg is an implicit tradeoff that can be outplayed with thoughtful squad tactics. Gw1 AB often had zergs on each side but if there was nothing else organised, that side would lose hardcore. It also remained something you could pug/ drop into for a really long time. 
---
Also really miss asymmetric PvP like Fort Aspenwood. 
---
If only the teeth weren't so unrealistic...
---
Man.. If I could change my equipment abilities and traits with the push of a button (just like switching weapons) that would be a complete gamechanger for me. I could actually switch to support stuff when I want to do a world boss or the like.
---
You are welcome to join us for some comfy raiding if you are on NA :)
---
GW2 raids are challenging without being tedious imo.
---
**Raiders In Training** https://discord.gg/SvsVzVQ
---
I absolutely agree, its my main dps for raiding with the rifle build.
---
I have not played WOW yet, but let me welcome you to the game. 
---
Welcome, I hope you get as much enjoyment out of this game as you did our of WoW.
---
xdddddddddd
---
Your other weapon set would be Mace/Mace for the massive break bar damage a.k.a. Crowd Control (CC). You’ll only encounter break bars in dungeons and high level mobs. It’s a blue coloured bar beneath the boss hp for example. 
---
Landing a CC attack such as Stun damages the blue bar and when it’s fully depleted, the boss is stunned and takes double damage briefly. He idea is that support classes provide most of the CC so pure DPS classes can focus on bringing dps utilities. 
---
There’s three types of end game Banner Slave: Core Warrior, Spellbreaker and Berserker. Berserker from HoT expansion is condi based and more suitable for raids where fights are longer. Spellbreaker from PoF expansion can neutralise enemy boons (try fighting a boss that reduces damage by 33%, gawd it takes forever!) while Core Warrior is the most optimal build for fractals if there’s no requirement to remove enemy boons. 
---
So yeah, even if you dislike one build you can always try the other two. For now, enjoy levelling your warrior :)
---
Your post has a lot of contradictory statements. 
---
* The TP needs a overhaul thus meaning they need to make a new one but you go on to say you want Anet to "purge or remove" listings that have been there for years. 
---
* You say everything is worthless cause of oversupply so I assume you're talking about raw materials. Well everything is worthless because there are no sinks and there are too many farms. 
---
* You go on to say it ruins mechanics like crafting or farming except oversupply is because of farming. The only way to give value to materials is new sinks and nerf the current farms. 
---
Maps like Istan and SW are generating too many items and thus killing the value of a ton of items. Even if you add sinks the items might rise for a week or two but they will eventually drop cause of the farms.
---
Happy to help... add me and message me/mail me in game. Mbelch.9028
---
No reward needed, but if you turn out good, we’ll want ya in our guild ;) 
---
Oh... the visual chaos of combat? Your eyes will adapt, I'd expect, but when more than a certain number of players are in combat in the same space, there is too much noise to see what you are fighting.  At that point, it becomes a trivial matter of "stand here, point the shooty or stabby thing towards the enormous blob of light until it  disappears to be replaced with a chest; rejoice in your hollow victory; repeat."
---
I'd love that. T.E.R.A. Had an extra, empty skill bar where you would place anything you wanted, consumables, mounts, novelties, equipment (not sure) that'd be soo great to have in GW2.
---
I agree about the matchmaking system. I disagree about your useless easy mode. 
---
That may be. But if I need half an hour to go through my inv I could have used that half an hour to get more loot to add to those 7g.
---
Yeah, I could use more NPC summon items. Not like I DON'T have 50 of those already collecting dust in my bank. At least they got rid of the boosts. Or another random dye container with an abysmal chance for a unique dye.
---
If it doesn't serve a purpose then it's like I got nothing at all. I never need NPC contracts. Not like a quick trip to the GH is too much of a hassle.
---
You seem to have all the qualities of a top-tier Raider. Except the most important one, you believe you are trash at the game mode. Power of the mind.
---
Pls remember, it's not about the codes getting activated on the first try. If the market place reseller has obtained the key in a fraudulent manner, the key can be revoked and the account terminated by Anet a few days/weeks/month down the line (depending on the course of events). Hence why people in the thread are reminding everyone to be careful when buying from amazon.
---
Having said that, if the seller is AMAZON itself, then you should be alright.
---
It's probably a stupid question and I know I could google it, but it's 8am and I yet have to really wake up... how do you farm bl keys weekly?
---
Haha. I remember that.
---
While not really easy to compare gameplay wise, going from GW2 to FFXIV was a phenomenal experience story wise.
---
I don't think the writing in GW2 really drew me in enough to care about any one character in particular. 
---
In that regard WoW and GW2 don't differ too much.
---
FFXIV is a whole other level of experience, though. The writing is outstanding and the voice acting is great. The presentation is such an upgrade.
---
While I'm taking a break from XIV now, I'm so incredibly excited about where the story will go next.
---
Fair point.
---
Why would you do frac 48? Iirc you only did 40&amp;50 back Then. 
---
can i have the 50% off one please?
---
Welcome to GW2!
---
So I suppose we disregard the [Black Lion Statuette](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Statuette) that you can use to get plenty of things if you save up for a while? 
---
Thanks for the info, now if only I had an empty character slot...
---
I think it might be gone now as it’s 12:40 MST for me but give it a try!
---
9bh2dxx2z
---
Let me know if it works!
---
Take it with you again then.
---
&gt; the screen is getting blur, then it goes white, and slowly blacking. And after that a sad version of Fear Not this Night starts playing...
---
That's called a film transition.
---
I keep on falling in love over and over with this game.
---
Thanks for the info, were Anet to kill chrono with next week's patch I may have found a new purpose for my mesmer's character slot
---
&gt;it's NOT GW1.
---
I also had more enjoyment in GW1, I think it's mostly because it was my first "MMO" and because I was younger; but I also prefer the more classical "old" universe, I'm not a big fan of "steampunk" (scarlett) or high tech (asura) in fantasy.
---
The main Storyline was more consistent too, I'm not a fan on how the main storyline of GW1 is a collection of dilluted stories separated by xp grind.
---
&gt;Skills being bound to weapons wasn't a bad idea.
---
That's actually one of the points I don't like about GW2, the build system of GW1 had greatly more potential and freshness than the skill system of GW2. Each build was (and there were hundreds) almost a class of its own with a specific gameplay and flavor. And the ease to obtain gear made it a heaven for horizontal progression.
---
Besides that, GW2 is really nice, I stopped soon after the fractals release but I'm getting back into it. I don't really know what to do though.
---
What... There is literally NO immersive reason for not being able to wear what you want.
---
Aaaacccttuuualllly, It's anti-immersive that you can't put on a hood just because you're a warrior. Clothes don't have a mind of their own. They shouldn't just be repulsed by your body. That's not immersive at all.
---
Going from WoW to GW2 was such a freeing experience, initially. Every class could dps and self-sustain, so I could roll with whatever class I wanted for whatever type of content. Everything was so incredibly free-form and - in a way - chaotic. I loved it.
---
However the price for that is that it felt as if I didn't really play "with" other people, but merely beside them. They were there because I needed them for group content, not because they in particular could give some unique aspect to the dungeon/fractal run.
---
The system has its pros and cons.
---
I never really got in to raids before I quit, because I had a very difficult time finding groups. Suddenly there was content that required specific gear setups in this otherwise casual chaotic game, and I couldn't really figure out how to approach that. If I started playing GW2 now knowing the raids would be there, I'd probably not find it so difficult to transition to that content, mind you.
---
Raiding in WoW was easy because you knew your role and how to best use it to compliment the group. It's also one of my favourite things about FFXIV.
---
On the other hand, I always felt as if I was playing alone in GW2 next to a bunch of other loners.
---
GW2 is a very unique experience I'd say. It has had its rough patches and it feels as if it's far from being "done".
---
In the end it was a great experience that as time went on got ruined (in my book) by the intense cash shop focus. It got sort of demoralizing to see new mounts and outfits in the cash shop every other week, while you had nothing really to strive for if you'd done the story and your legendary weapon of choice.
---
I'd say that as long as you know that GW2 is a bit of an amalgamation of a game, you'll really enjoy your time with it.
---
Just don't mention Scarlet to any players who played during the living stoey season 1. ;)
---
Alliance battles were part of the kurzick/Luxon conflict (GW factions) so it makes sense that it's "missing".
---
Though, I'd love a canthan expansion and the PvP maps/elements bound to it.
---
Honestly people talk all day about leveling in gw2 but i HATE it so much. I much much prefer being 80 and having pretty much all my spells.... because you can scale back to do any content anyway. IMO your actual level matters so little in gw2 but the game really restricts you until pretty late levels which sucks. It sounds dumb but maybe just boost to 80 and play the game. Do what hearts, exploration, stories, or tasks you want and do others later. 
---
Hate to be negative in such a positive thread but imo not being 80 in guild wars SUCKS big time. I have leveled 2 1/2 characters now and am happy that i boosted my 3rd at like 50
---
&gt; But if u wanna run a healer thief with soldier stats kind of build not even the training dummy (with the aoe dmg) will be easy enough for you. So in that case u dont just ask for an easier raid..u ask for another mode completely
---
Nah that's not what I want, of course the build should make some sense, I'm not going to run random stuff like that and call it "experimental".
---
But raids were sold to me by Anet as full-ascended-required-dry-your-tears-at-the-anvil kind of content, and I guess that's when I stopped bothering. I never even tried to find a group, because I imagined the lfg-experience would be horrible for me, especially if I don't run a meta-build, and trying to fill "my own squad where I run what I want" would take ages and then possibly fail.
---
I don't know, the whole concept behind raids just never encouraged me to bother with them.
---
I strongly suggest u wait till Jan 8 and wait till the new meta settles down. Chrono is a class which is the ultimate support as of now, but after the patch it might get buffed or nerfed or maybe some other class like Firebrand or Renegade might take up the mantle. So wait it out! Is the best advice for now :)
---
Utilizing bonus experience is the absolutely fastest way to level. When you kill something you'll see base and bonus experience pop up. The bonus XP is based on the amount of time something is alive in the world. The longer it's alive without being killed, the more bonus XP accrues.
---
Using buffs like food and utility and guild buffs (and banners if available), you can increase the amount of XP you get from kills. It's quite easy to gain a level every 10 minutes or so from just killing stuff with high bonus XP.
---
Just go into an area, away from hearts, kill what you can as fast as you can. If you see it has low bonus XP, dont' kill more. A couple of quick kills as a litmus test and move into the next area.
---
Yellow creatures like moas or dolyaks that don't attack are usually pretty good. Areas under water too. And stay away from heart areas.
---
Some people find this more boring that zone complete, but some find it a lot less boring. Particularly if you can see that you're going up faster.
---
You can still participate in events on the way to break up the monotony.  Make sure you get every waypoint and hero point as well.
---
Don't do hearts if they aren't fun for you. They don't give that much exp and are generally boring. They only exist for traditional mmo players who are lost without questing guides. Dynamic events gives far more exp. 
---
I don’t think an oversupply of items is an inherent TP failure. It’s oversupplied because the items drop so often but no one needs them, and people would rather have them listed (and paying the 5% fee), than just vendoring (most likely due to the fact that you can access TP anywhere whilst your bags are full, but not a vendor; for that 5% fee, you get to store it without losing storage space, and vendor it later on thus still keep 95% of its value).
---
Supply gluts happen everywhere (even in the real world); the solution is not to craft those things (which people already do not do, since most are dropped from mobs), nothing to do with a change in the TP.
---
The TP itself is merely a marketplace that facilitates the buying and selling of items from player to player; that it does efficiently, and removes 15% of value off the market, which indirectly curbs inflation. 
---
I do wish they moved a little more like the wings from City of Heroes. Standing or running, they were stiff and folded, but upon jumping, they'd animate and flap once or twice before folding back to their original position. It was great.
---
Sorry I should’ve specified that!
---
Battle for Azeroth, the latest expansion. 
---
We gamers always abbreviate everything haha. 
---
I have very similar experiances. Played WoW since Legion and got hooked in. Top5 guild on server raiding for progress high m+ keys got very addicted. I used to play GW2 from time to time but never got hooked in I considered the game more casual and as a more kinda hardcore player I didint want to continue. BFA as we all know offers very little and even tho I grinded m+ keys and raided hard I just got bored of it really quickly around end of October. Just realising how bad this expansion is. How empty and rushed by developers not learning a bit from previous failures. So I finished Witcher 3 ( im Polish and it sucks I did it so late ) and played other games. Then the idea of coming back to Guild Wars 2 popped up and im here. Reading reddit everyday playing after work and enjoying the world completly. Amount of content game has to offer when you reach 80 is just overwhelming but in a good way. Here you are not forced to do Island Expedition or Battlegrounds or whatever developers planned for you. You just play the game the way you want and its amusing at least. Im trying to do daily fractals and pvp every day since im planning to progress towards legendary backpack and it requires time. But I love the rest of time I have to play i can choose whether I do more exploring world to finally hit 100% or just do some achievements I googled before and get some juicy points or just go for more living story in party with my friend ( which btw is awesome  ! you can do all story quest in party and have fun and try to get all achievements ). So yea.... gw2 is beautiful and I dont know how long I will enjoy it but I hope long enough. Its worth it. And I gladly spend some dollars for gems just to support and maybe get some awesome costume look or more living stories. Good luck enjoy the game and see you in Tyria!

It's a bug. All of my characters are women and I've only had my character misgendered once. I reported it at the time and hopefully it's been fixed.
---
Isn't Pack Runes 5 stacks of Might once per encounter? AFAIK the reason it is recommended is because Chrono can extend its duration. On a FB/Ren comp it should eventually wear off, and without them FB should only have 5 stacks from Mantra (correct me if I am wrong).
---
Tbh there's no real justification for why there's exactly three sides in WvW either, why not just have an AB mode as a 'mist war', a timeless echo of the old conflict? PvP in guild wars has never been enormously reinforced by lore imo and doesn't need to be.
---
Completely agree with you wrt a Canthan expansion that could have new PvP styles though
---
I have played wow not for so long. Maybe 2 years. I started on pirate servers from WotL and i got pretty bored. Bought official game in Pandaria and i kinda like it more (even if everyone told me it was one of the shitties expansions ever).
---
 I droped it after a while, we played(with friends) like a few months, then usually come back and make 2 or 3 more months. Lets say in total i have played like 1 or 2 years. (I have still played plenty of other mmorpgs)
---
When i download Gw2 i just loved it. And i loved it a lot more than WoW. And please i dont saying WoW is bad, its just i dont like it like Gw2. And i have several points of it.
---
First of all the idea of having several builds with characters and the skill changing with the weapon resulted me fascinating. That was my first awesome impresion of GW2 that &gt;I&lt; havent seen in any other game. Second and very important to me: Lore. Im not a huge lore fan becouse in some games it overwhelming and bad explained. GW has a great way to explain main story and no matter if you start today, you can catch up, evenutally with the people. About this i have 2 points: First the "single player like" idea of main story its something i like a lot, i think its great to have to do the story, calmy and alone and IF YOU WANT with a party. You can really enjoy any aspect of it literally in a personal way. The other stuff about main story is decisions. Making decisions and having a truly impact on story path its something i  found really positive and encouragint to people. 
---
I LOVE how you can play as you want in this game, and thats is something almost unique in a mmorpg.
---
The other important point is: Every zone is used ingame. No matter if you have the latest expansion or non, both kind of people will be together in several maps. WoW map is HUGE and with a lot of potential and stuff but old zones are absolutelly obsoletes. GW2 makes use of all content and that makes it pretty more friendly. No matter where you go there is always someone doing stuff. That makes you also having a lot of stuff to do. There are huge ammounts of achievements and the achievement points rewards really hype you to continue playing.
---
Other stuff i love about this game is you are always usefull, you might be lvl 5 and there is some global boss or super event going on and you can just go and join the brawl. Even if you have shitty equip or not all skills unlocked you can always grab a banner, revive people, etc. That is something awesome, you dont need to super grind to make fun stuff, you can do it all the time and eventually as you progress you have even more fun stuff to do. At hand with this, player auto-level in different maps is awesome too: you dont need to create a new character every time a friend start playing, you can just play with your own and help him/her anyway.
---
Im sure there are a lot of stuff  more but i can think it now (cuz im at work lmao)
---
Anyways
---
Long live to Gw2 &lt;3
---
No, But you are a jerk that posted. 
---
I'm handling T1 fractals just fine in exotic gear, I know I'll need agony resistance, but I have fully ascended trinkets. And fractals is a decent way to get some ascended gear. So sure you need ascended for later fractals, but there's nothing stopping you from running fractals in exotics
---
A side note here is that In this comparisons, you still see how relevant the chronomancer is, since it takes 2 supports to compensate for 1 ;)
---
Let’s start a guild “Fuck Activision”
---
I'm playing on Gandara and i was pretty happy about my server yet people started to complain about server, people and commanders all the time these days (it was like 1-2 months ago but i'm pretty sure it's still same). I can suggest you Whiteside Ridge or Piken Square. Those two were our biggest enemies as far as i know.
---
You can check out rankings from [here](https://leaderboards.guildwars2.com/en/eu/wvw)
---
It's like as if this is the gw2 sub or something :^)
---
What? I got some ascended accessories throughout the game without even trying, just as rewards for things (story?).
---
&gt; Its actually the opposite, the overwhelming majority of items is traded above vendor value. The recent change to runes and sigils also lifted a couple of hundred different items off vendor value on the tp. 
---
this makes no sense in the context of what you replied to.
---
&gt; There are only 600 Precise Iron Swords listed on the tp, far above vendor value. 
---
it was just an example, well be lucky if 30 of those ever get sold.
---
&gt; What problem is this supposed to fix?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Higher value listings that havent been sold for a month/year are an integral part of keeping the economy balanced because they offer a supply buffer for times when an item sees additional demand due to changes to the client/content updates. Without those listings, prices become way more volatile and make it easier for traders to buy out entire stocks of an item.
---
Higher value listings serve no purpose, its the equivalent one person hoarding wealth, it doesn't affect the economy as it will never again touch the economy. its just gonna sit in the tp doing nothing until the servers get shutdown.
---
Items don't see demand fluctuations, thats the entire issue, i guarantee you there are items from the beta still sat in the TP. There will never be a time where 600 people decide to buy the exact same precise iron sword. 
---
A market is supposed to have volatile pricing, otherwise it may as well just be an NPC vender.
---
&gt; Yes, Anet, please give me 200k gold for those 200k eyes of kormir/thorns/cauliflower I listed at 1g, this will definately fix the economy /s 
---
I specifically said this wouldn't work.
---
&gt; Why do we need less items on the market? 
---
Because right now supply outweighs the demand like 100-1, which means the economy stagnates, stock doesn't move and prices never change. This completely defeats the purpose of having a market. 
---
&gt; Salvage All already exists 
---
your reading comprehension could use some work
---
https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/
---
You can do this right now. It's easy to install, it's approved by ArenaNet, and most importantly, it **works**. Yes, it's a third party add-on, so the "use at your own risk" disclaimer is going to be there, and I'm not here to devalue that disclaimer, but the least I can say is that a huge portion of the community uses the plugin, including myself, and it has worked like a dream.
---
I'm totally with you and anyone else who wants a first-party build templates feature. But in the meantime, Arc's build templates addon gives you that pleasure of being able to swap entire builds, gear and all, in 4 clicks instead of 100.
---
I'm not really a wow player, but what made me really enjoy GW2 was the introduction of [action camera](https://youtu.be/Kn19s9UGEIo).
---
GW2 killed it's reputation in the first few months so that wouldn't change much.
---
The biggest problem I'm having with GW2 is my inability to solo even simple questing content. I've tried the PoF story on both a Warrior and Necro/Reaper, and I get shredded by everything.
---
Solo mobs generally aren't the issue unless they're elite (or whatever the gw equivalent is), but when I go to investigate an area to progress the story and manage to aggro every single mob within 20 yards its really hard not to just log out of the game. 
---
No unless there's kodan there.Using the last episode as an example we only had these masteries in the previous episodes because of the story with the jungle phasing into the Jahai Bluff.
---
Again unlikely we may get lore on the Seers but it wouldn't make sense and we already met the last seer in one of the missions in GW1 and I believe they are completely dead.
---
Am working towards Chuka and Champawat. *That's* a grind.
---
Ascended is not necesarry for anything but infusion slots though.
---
Cool. I must look into that! Thanks for the heads-up! :D
---
zone stories were one thing I really loved about CoH - here though it's the personal story and the living world seasons that would fill that niche
---
9 alts. So sweet, so innocent.
---
Good riddance, with all that depressingly sad colors and annoying constant sounds of throwing snowballs.
---
Also quit during BFA after playing WoW for many years. Legion was one of the best expansions I've played despite its flaws and it feels like BFA took a huge step back from all of the good things introduced in the previous expansion.   
---
I've played GW2 on and off since release and it's had its ups and downs but at no point has there been a low as bad as BFA. The new expansion is extremely good and I really like how mounts were integrated into it with a purpose other than running through content quickly. The elite spec system is a great idea to keep classes feeling fresh, although I wish the GW2 team would pay attention to all aspects of classes instead of only the new specs that way more playstyles could be rewarding. At this point it would be nice to see a team working on making each aspect of a class relevant, ie. Vanilla Thief, Deadeye, and Daredevil, so one team for each of those specs, that way each are actually decent. Other than that, I don't have any gripes with the game other than it's a bit too hard to earn gems and I don't want to pay 25$ for a mount skin.
---
Kind of true but you don't get anywhere without infusions though. You can't even enter fractals, and good luck finding a pick up group for raids.
---
Yikes
---
I mean they can do whatever they want with anything, because it's a game they're developing. If they want to make some kind of 16v16 mode that involves multiple squads but isn't as en Masse as WvW, they literally can just do that because they're developers. 
---
Of course it won't be exactly the same (different combat alone precludes that) , but I don't think a sensible reading of what I was saying suggests I was saying it would be - just that 16v16 type formats and asymmetrical PvP are fun and I'd like to see them in Gw2. 
---
If you paid for living world episodes, because any newcomer joining now doesn't have access to either Bitterfrost Frontier or Sandswept Isles. If they're looking to gear up a character with HoT or PoF stats they're fucked.
---
Nowadays the real fun starts on lvl 80, kind of...I mean, leveling experience is great and fun, but the huge amount of content that opens up for you once you hit lvl 80 is....terrifyingly big. Just take your time and don't rush. Also have in mind that if you don't see fun in some specific game parts, you are not forced to do it (for now). Literally everything gives experience, so leveling up can be done by thousands of different ways. One just has to embrace the freedom to play however he wants.
---
1) if you used a level booster you are in the wrong gear type. So you probably wont be able to kill things fast. 
---
2) you need to start learning to move/kite and attack the enemy at the same time while dodging enemies attacks. you can't just stand there and attack like in wow. Press esc -&gt; options, then scroll down to "Combat/Movement" and untick Melee Attack Assist. Now you can run through enemies to their back side stopping some of their attacks while you kite.
---
Gw2 has really awesome combat but has some really bad defaults.
---
&gt; this makes no sense in the context of what you replied to.
---
you complained that items on the tp are worthless, but they arent. Your initial statement made no sense.
---
&gt; it was just an example, well be lucky if 30 of those ever get sold.
---
It wasnt an example, it was hyperbole. Precise Iron Swords are bought and sold just fine. At the beginning of Nov, 48 sold in one swoop, another 17 at the end of november, plus some other smaller transactions.
---
They main demand also comes from salvaging them for iron ore (the item sink you dont seem to be aware of) and I also dont see anything wrong with its 1s trading value on average, since its 5 times higher than the vendor value and a common loot drop.
---
&gt; Higher value listings serve no purpose, its the equivalent one person hoarding wealth, it doesn't affect the economy as it will never again touch the economy. its just gonna sit in the tp doing nothing until the servers get shutdown.
---
They serve as emergency supply in case of sudden demand. Just because that scenario hasnt happened yet, doesnt mean it wont be needed in the future.
---
Besides the recent rune and sigil update, which purged millions of old listings of runes, sigils and green gear, it also happened on a grand scale when they introduced essences of luck as salvage material from blue and green gear 5 years ago.
---
Anyways, even if you are right, (and partially you are because there is no denying that there are listings on the tp that are over 6 years old) how do these listings in your opinion have a negative effect on the economy?
---
&gt; Items don't see demand fluctuations, thats the entire issue, i guarantee you there are items from the beta still sat in the TP. There will never be a time where 600 people decide to buy the exact same precise iron sword.
---
Are we actually playing the same game and using the same tp? Because nothing you claim here seems to be true, if you check the numbers an the trading post. There is no need for 600 players to buy a sword each, all it takes is one player to buy all 600 of them for salvage, for example if the price for iron should spike.
---
It seems you think the ideal state of the market would be no listed items at all and I wonder why.
---
&gt; A market is supposed to have volatile pricing, otherwise it may as well just be an NPC vender.
---
A market should have fluctuating pricing, not volatile pricing. Its ok, if iron ore gains 50% of value over the course of a month but its not ok if iron ore gains and loses 50% value every day.
---
&gt; I specifically said this wouldn't work.
---
Then why mention it?
---
&gt; your reading comprehension could use some work
---
how does automated salvaging at any rate have any impact on intermediate or advanced crafting materials, gems and jewels or cooking supplies?
---
There's a key on your keyboard that says PrtScn. That's your print screen key, it takes a screenshot.
---
&gt;And fractals is a decent way to get some ascended gear. So sure you need ascended for later fractals, but there's nothing stopping you from running fractals in exotics
---
I don't know where this myth comes from that Fractals are a decent way to get Ascended Gear on your first character. The Drop Rate for Ascended Chests is absolutely abysmal except for T4, and the ascended trinkets' drop rate scales hard with fractal tier aswell, not even mentioning the fact that they'll most likely have the wrong stats and don't salvage into Weapon/Armor ascended Crafting materials. Those btw also only commonly drop from T3 and T4 dailies, which you need more than just ascended trinkets to reach unless you drop a stupid amount of Gold in the TP on high level AR infusions/farm a ridiculous amount of fracs. Even people doing "Beginner guides to Fractals" or series on how to level AR on a new account reccomend crafting your Ascended Gear.
---
&gt; To me, GW2 represents what WoW could have become--should have been, really.
---
Three "bosses" per bite-sized """raids"""? 5-6 bosses top per year? That's what you think WoW should have been? :-/
---
I pretty much have the exact same background as you do, been a very hardcore raider from vanilla to LK in top 10 progress guilds and I definitely do not wish for WoW to ever become a clone of GW2.
---
Both games are good and definitely deserve to be played for their differences, but even for a retired raider as myself GW2's content is too scarce. Can't wait for Classic. :)
---
Not exactly true. You can reach 'good enough' levels of survivabilty, boon duration and healing power for support classes even on rare/masterwork mix of gear. Quite a bit of commanders of my raid training guild do so on their alt accounts, just because you can spend like 5 gold to gear the tank/offtank chronomancer this way. You will only lose some dps, which isn't your job on those builds. Meanwhile, every stat point and every weapon strenghth matters a lot when you're trying to dish out the best damage you can do. Beteeen exotic and ascended gear there is up to 15% damage difference, depending on build. Neglecting food is another 7% damage decrease. Using rare or masterwork gear will cut your damage in half. At that point, cheaply geared support is much more effective in group than dps that can't even do their job half right.
---
But doing T1s isn't exactly "running fractals" though. The droprates and rewards are too low. Even the recipe for attuning rings and grabbing extra infusion slots requires to do T3s at least. You're pigeonholed into vanilla stats because farming ascended trinkets in Fractals, other than the vanilla rings, is 100 pristine relics each. Newcomers only doing T1 will get 4 per day, maximum. If they don't have access to living world episodes as a much more reliable source of ascended gear, it's just too much of a grind.
---
Anet has been looking for mobile devs.
---
There's no such thing as a proper tank class like you might have on others MMO in GW2. 
---
As for your class choice though, guardian can be both played as a DPS with a very high burst, a support healer or even a damage over Time DPS (called conditions in GW2). All of those though would be more efficient using the elite specializations from the Expansion pack.
---
You can enter and start learning tier 1 fractals with no ascended gear whatsoever. Agony doesn't start until fractal 20.
---
Played GW2 a year or two ago and had managed to only get power gear. I'm not sure of their tier but I think they're pink in color (exotic?). I have level 80 druid, reaper, berserker but it's been a while since I played so I was thinking maybe I should start a fresh new character to get a feel of the game again as I felt quite lost when I jumped into the game. Last expansion I played was HoT and man was it messy, I hated the maps traverse with a passion. PoF is on sale right now so I'm thinking of getting back into the game. What do you advise?   
---
Also, I have no ideas what the living story or season is about. I never had a single episode for free because I was always inactive. How big a deal are they? 
---
1 per account per week.
---
This is awesome. I just got back into GW2, haven't played it since 2013, and the new maps in heart of thorns are really overwhelming haha. I'm definitely gonna do my best to be there!
---
Hmm, this might help: https://discretize.eu/builds
---
Imo, it takes a bit of skill, but the Elementalist can fill those roles with some work, despite being an overall glass cannon. I think Warrior is probably one of the easiest classes to get down, but also fairly powerful. Guardian is also good and is a tough nut to crack, but has low HP. I would suggest Necromancer, but they do not heal (much), though they are a ton of fun to play. Mesmers are interesting, but not a favorite of mine. And, never felt like trying thief though their single target dps is probably the highest of the bunch.
---
Would be easier to examine the playstyle options, if the basic class abilites don't make you click.
---
Do you prefer melee or ranged ? Power (direct hit) or condi (DoT) ? Burst or DPS ? Few skills or many options ? Selfish DPS or more supporting options ? Do you like huge mobility ?
---
Out of curiosity, what makes BfA such a colossal failure?
---
The fact you just had a meltdown proves you needed the lesson. Also who the fuck are you to act like a twat like that? 
---
You can play any profession besides warrior thief and mesmer as a healer/supporter. Warrior can be a dps/support with banners and shouts that affect 5-10 players.
---
The first and foremost important advice for every WoW veteran moving to GW2.
---
Don't expect that GW2 is a slightly different WoW. It is everything that WoW isn't and more. Let go of most of the notions about MMO games, that WoW cemented. They do not work here.
---

Check out mesmer, You can play him Support/dps, tank dps and dps , its an amazing profession for pvp as well. 
---
Gw2 is its own game though and over all better than GW1.
---
GW1 was pretty much a WoW clone combat wise with global CD on skills but with more customization for builds in a trinity based environment. I personally would not want to play GW1 combat given how engaging and fun GW2 combat is especially with harder end game pve content. And GW2's combat system will run smooth as silk up to around 300ms ping, which basically will cover most of the world. Gw1 would have rubberbanded all over the place.
---
Swordmaster Faren has no time for such frivolous activities.
---
Dungeons and early level Fractals do not have a hard gate at all. Get rare or exotic gear and give them a go.
---
It's great to see that this game is still going quite strong.
---
As mainly a www player, I feel a bit at an disadvantage because everyone is gliding from higher places. Is the thorns expansion worth it as a www player? 
---
I really suggest to try everything, because playstyles and  builds differ very much from what you read.
---
Healers are appreciated in end-game instanced PvE.  However, getting to that stage as a new or returning player is not easy.  You can absolutely play some sort of boon-support or healer class like Guardian (Firebrand.  Supporting in early-game, low difficulty PvE content is pretty thankless because stuff in dungeons or T1/T2 Fractals are weak and die too quickly.   
---
The problem with a lot of healing early on is that most of the stuff that's really dangerous will just flat out be a OHKO.  While you can do things like time applications of aegis (blocks) for allies-- you can't heal downed bodies without first rezzing them  There's a certain margin for gameplay in GW2 where people have to get better at dodging ("Git Gud") and learn to expect dangerous attacks from specific mobs.  
---
You could play something support-based like Tempest, Druid, Firebrand, Herald, Guardian (DH or FB).  However, I think you'll generally find that it's more satisfying short-term to play a DPS class that can flex support skills either innately via profession mechanics or by slotting in 1-2 support skills without crippling your DPS output.  
---
I mean, you're always expected to do some damage. But I play Chrono and get away with only doing 3-8k dps where others are expected to be 15-30k depending on the run type. 
---
Reasoning being, if you're good at your role you cause overall DPS to increase higher than you could possibly contribute otherwise.
---
So yes, you are expected to do some damage. But if you're using a good rotation it fits in well. 
---
(Also, druids are expected to do even less)
---
Do those codes work in Europe? 
---
Can't wait for the final result !
---
You don't need to be on the same server to play together, you just need to be in the same region (NA or EU). Unless you're playing WvW, then you need to be on either the same server or the server that's linked with yours.
---
You can check your sever on the character select screen, just click on the "Word Selection" button in the lower left corner.
---
Point is you're not locked out of fractals as a person said. Nobody who hasn't done fractals cares about challenging content yet. They can easily farm aacended gear to reach higher fractals and it's not heavy grind in this sense.
---
I once contacted funko and asking them about it.and i got a reply(wich was a Nice one) Where they explained it wasnt as easy as it seems due to legal stuff and other things.hopefully one day.
---
No stap, the soundtrack is better
---
*watched stream for 2 mins and made an opinion
---
I'd say just go with Guardian (DH) and then later you can setup a support Firebrand if you're so inclined.  Guardian does well in every game mode and has been a solid all-rounder for years.  
---
I abandoned ship a few months into Cataclysm, and I haven't look back since. Wow is but a distant memory that I'm glad I'm free of.
---
Also, Welcome go the community! :) 
---
Many months playing an expansion and then quitting sounds pretty standard for an mmo. How exactly was it a colossal failure?
---
Yeah, heal hybrid Chrono is definitely a thing.
---
60 attempts and no druid thought about using spirit of nature before the clap?
---
Getting carried for all raid wings~
---
funny, I play two big games (plus a lot of others, but w/e) : 
---
GW2, which welcomed WoW refugees
---
Path of Exile, which welcomed Diablo3 "immortal" (you cannot kill what is already dead) refugees
---
I haven't been on Dota/LoL where they should be taking the HotS refugees since blizzard gave up on them.
---
A good year for Blizzard, indeed
---
Easiest class to play and fun imo, i have all classes and i consider this "main" , is warrior, although at the time he has a single role to support with banners and do some dmg. If you want to be god of pve, mesmer is your choice. They are heavily needed in all pve scenarios,as chronomancer mostly. They have also really good specs for pvp. Now if you want a class that you can play multiple roles and you don't like ranger or engineer or revenant, then guardian is your choice definately as he can play dps and heal pretty well.
---
But, in my opinion you are heavily influenced by wow in the way you think. Here in GW2 you can have alts pretty easy and gear them and swap the gear between your characters. You don't have to have one class only to do everything!
---
We welcomed Bless Online refugees, we will gladly welcome the refugees from World of Warcraft. 
---
I am the veteran of Guild Wars 2 - I have played GW2 for almost 6 years now. It was my first ever game that I played, and I didn't get a sense of this game until I finished the whole Personal story and reached 80 on my main - Elementalist. 
---
This summer I played some of WoW (not because I was bored by GW2, not at all), just wanted to know why it's still so lively. I still don't have an answer for that question, Dungeons grind and not getting a reward annoyed me, it felt like I try so hard to keep up the mechanics, be useful and do the heck of dps, and when the fight ends I get 20 gold or some shitty items, I didn't feel rewarded. Why do you even do those dungeons? 
---
Even the story felt so weird, there were moments that blew my mind, but there is so many quests that make me forget what's the point of the story. I don't want to read all of those lists: "Help me, I need help, Gather 2 shells for tortollians" and so forth. In GW2 I am not forced to read all of the dialogues, I can listen to it, hear my characters' voice, interacting with NPCs, and can easily move away from them if something else gets my attention. 
---
Also I played the whole Legion, and actually the ending cinematic with this Pantheon was really amazing. And I watched Sargeras piercing his sword and wounding Azeroth, it was great, but then I was like: Why the hell I see him in the end?! Is that the end?! Where is a battle? 
---
It looked like it was too much for the devs to design a proper battle with this fallen god. He was sooo huge, and couldn't be seen during any chapter. I understand he just commanded from the shadows, but that's lame. 
---
Path of Fire is also very similar to Legion, but only when it comes to this fallen god thread. And be ready to have A LOT of personal interactions with Balthazar, he won't just stand in one point, not making a move like Sargeras, he will be active and his music theme is one of the best battle music in this game for sure. 
---
I follow the WoW story, kind of. I'm interested in how Sylvanas plot will play out, and she keeps me interested in WoW's story. 
---
And also the Night Warrior quest kind of didn't make much sense.  &gt;!She freaking got the powers from Elune, and could easily smash the Hordes with one blow, and when she stood to fight with Nathanos, he freaking escaped with no single scar... I don't know... it looked like they wanted to show Tyrande powerful and she could actually blow Nathanos out of the sight, and also the writers just kept him alive which didn't make any sense, he just easily flew off and Tyrande full of anger and so pissed off just let him go... Who wrote this?!&lt; 
---
 
---
Well, this is actually most profittable activity in the game, if you wanna get more than 8k gold per year (from daily tier 4 fractals + daily rewards etc.) then it is valid thing to do.
---
12:30 pm cst would be 5.5 hours before reset.
---
Nice try arenanet.. :D
---
But seriously, congrats!
---
I want to cry. I had written up a big reply to you, but Chrome fucked up.

tl;dr of the tl;dr I made: I never want GW2 to become like WoW. Group Finder, imo, has been the most significant killer of WoW's 'community'. I would be devastated if they implemented something like that in GW2.
---
I never even got the chance to play bfa cause my otherwise perfectly functional imac has got some outdated component and no way am I upgrading when it don't need to to play some half rate wow expansion 
---
I think herald (regen trait) is the only spec that shares improved boon effect. Everyone else is selfish in that regard. 
---
&gt;I don't know where this myth comes from that Fractals are a decent way to get Ascended Gear on your first character.
---
Yeah, I wonder that too and every single time I say that I just get downvoted with no replies.
---
Most of the ascended stuff you get are just garbage rings with weird stats that aren't useful. You salvage them if you get lucky with salvage tool drop, buying salvage tool to salvage them is net loss last time I checked.
---
Armor box droprate isn't something to praise either, even in T4, from my experiences, I did T4 every day for a month straight and I literally got 3 boxes, 2 pairs of boots and a helmet IIRC.
---
find a guild and do guild runs. In my guild runs i actually  have fun and laugh and if we fail we take it lightly. I do clears with pugs.
---
Welcome :) Take it all in. I still remember the feeling I had when I first started playing. The world is so much bigger now too.
---
Personally I find staff completely not worth swapping to unless I need the projectile hate or staff 3 for movement, which is very rare.
---
The Seer(s) we met during GW were never confirmed to have been the same one, also they were one of the races present during the elder dragons last active cycle so it would make sense.
---
For me, the best thing in GW2 is that you NEVER lose your progress. In WoW, your equipment that you worked so hard to get, becomes useless after the next expansion. The expansions in GW2, offer you new ways to play your characters. Its your choice if you want to play an older build, or a new one. Your equipment will never become useless (if they add a new stat combo you want, you can change to that stats. You don't lose the previous equipment), giving you the opportunity to gear up another build, or another character. Expansions, instead of raising level cap, have a more sophisticated system, where you level up masteries instead, giving all your characters new abilities (gliding, mounts and many other things).
---
Or you want 9 professions.
---
I knowguy who got HoT amulet with liquid aurillium from herta
---
The HMS Divinity. 
---
The ship might look a bit silly, but sniping fools with cannonballs, water footfalls, mist aura, and the sounds make this legendary for me. 
---
They don't ask for infusions specifically but on exotic gear you're likely to get kicked after first try as a DPS player cause your numbers are too low, I see this happen every other day
---
Astralaria, I love anything celestial themed.
---
But it's an optional one, since the stats aren't any better than ascended. He refers to the constant addition of better gear with each expansion of games with a gear treadmill.
---
I wish I was in a helpful guild... 
---
The subreddit does not allow to post explicit exploits?
---
That's as old as the world.
---
I am actually kinda surprised WoW-players honestly see GW2 as a "shit wow". The games are so fundamentally different it's crazy to compare them in such a way. 
---
I don't know any other exploit of the dungeon, hence my question :/
---
While true, statswap and sigil swap kinda play their role here. I don't know an awful lot about stat swap conditions, but I'm currently running with the moot (base) with vipers (HoT), so I'm assuming stats added in expansions are generally available on legacy legendary weapons. So in a sense, crafting a legendary is like crafting every possible combination of stats for that given weapon type, including future combinations, and for that weapon at least, replacing the treadmill altogether. 
---
There's not many awesome visual things on mesmer besides butterflies. Necro has like 3 transformations.
---
Astralaria hands down.
---
I'd rather guild halls and decorations became more relevant. Perhaps having personal areas within the guild hall for best of both worlds. Decorating is more fun together.
---
The appropriate response here is: Thanks for the detailed reponse! I guess I didn’t really know what I was talking about after all, my bad!
---
Is it really that strict?  The difference is only like 12% IIRC
---
The pvp lobby has NPCs which sell basic armor and weapons adjusted every 5 lvls (on lvl 26 vendor offers lvl 25 stuff, on 34 they offer lvl 30, etc). These are fine for early levels, and cheap as hell.
---
Other than that, trading post but strangely enough sometimes low level gear is more expensive than their max lvl equivalent.
---

---
Dunno. I'm not new and there's plenty I appreciate about this game. I only have to try a few other games to realize how much.  
---
Besides the crossroads Inn you could check out the raid training initiative (rti.enjin.com). It's a bit less consistent in terms of when a training is organised, but it can be great if you're looking for a specific kill.
---
Nevermore!
---
But I die whe literally fighting three veteran awakened. When I run out of dodges I'm fucked really. When I had random gear I used to do little damage but tank 5 veterans. 
---
It would be nice to have very easy versions of raids with a raid finder like mechanic though. Raid finder like thing is already in the game too for stuff like Infinarium and the Halloween stuff. Just to ease people in they can do something like either only W1 Raid Finder for a week or two and then W2 only. Make it 15 or 20 players instead of 10 too.
---
If you want a Wrath server, I *highly* recommend Dalaran.
---
I'm not entirely sure I understand your point. I agree it's a convenience item, and with a single set of stats, the it's on par with the ascended equivalent, it's still better, just in a different way. If new stats are made available, you can swap right away (as with my earlier comment, I'm assuming this is how it works rather than knowing for certain). Meanwhile, without legendary, you need to craft a new weapon or do mystic forge stat swap. 
---
The stats may be the same, but it's a better weapon. It's still the next progressive step. 
---
&gt; you don't really really need to have it. 
---
Nothing is *needed*, it's just going to make life that much easier. Sure you're going to have a bad time trying to doing anything recent in fine or masterwork gear, but as you said yourself, exotics are just fine. I rarely play WvW, never play PvP and have never touch a raid, but my understanding is that stats that may work in one may not do so well in another. In that sense, stat swap isn't needed, but is going to make life that much easier. 
---
&gt;It would be kind of a joke if the best items you can get in-game didn't need any sort of time-investment to get
---
This was my point to begin with.

Signet Mastery, Sundering Burst and Dual Wielding are the reasons I use Arms, and they're not related to condition damage. What would Discipline have that makes it better than Arms?

Made a lot of them, but Astralaria is probably my favourite. Space axe best axe &lt;3

Verdarach.

The sound is awesome, his size is insane, and the weapon swap animation is nuts. I often play minstrel shout spellbreaker in WvW (magenta female norn), this warhorn is the mvp.

---
Chuka! Great quest, beautiful design. I love it’s footfalls and draw effects. I’m hoping more classes get it in future! 
---
Shining Blade, hands down.
---
Even though I dont particularly like its footprints, the whole design has a certain "epicness" to it that I find lacking in a lot of the other legendaries. 
---
The best way to find what you like is to make a character move to the PvP lobby and to the dummy area and try it out. Thing with our PvP is that you get upscaled to lvl 80 and all your skills and traits are unlocked. If you own the expansions the elite specs will also be unlocked. You can move to the pvp lobby at lvl 2.
---
Mesmer is essentially a class blessed by the gods (devs).
---
They are very versatile, have a huge number of viable builds (key here being viable), and as such, are very popular because of the reasons stated above.
---
The only condition is that the player must be very apt at producing results with all the potential presented in the class.
---
A bad mesmer is horrifyingly bad, while a good mesmer is a god.
---
Necro on the other hand is a very simple class at it's core : Tanky Damage.
---
That's why when Necromancers explore their Elite Specs, they feel like an entirely new class, one being a more supportive condition mage, the other being a in-the-face bruiser with unmatched melee prowess.
---
Fashion Wars wise, it doesn't really matter : both are Light armored class, which have access to the same pool of skins.
---
Gameplay wise : Necromancers have a simple playstyle, and very relaxing gameplay in general content, simply because of how beefy they are and their consistent damage.
---
Mesmers on the other hand, have a very high skill requirement and would need the player to practice alot and explore guides on how to further better their gameplay.
---
They also have more complex gameplays than Necromancers, and require alot of "in the moment" decisions to use their skills in order to achieve victory. 
---
Also the chances yu might end up in Chronojail is increased by 150% once yu decide to main Mesmer. 
---
You traded survivability for damage, so you need to be more on point with your active defense like dodges, evades, stuns, etc. You can’t facetank in berserkers. 
---
If you’re struggling you can trade in some zerkers for soldiers or something with a defensive stat to give a bit more survivability. Just be aware that you’re essentially “crutching” yourself and the ideal is always to go full glass if possible.

Astralaria. If they ever decide to make a set of weapons, armour, backpiece or anythibg like that I would craft all of them. I just like painty space effects
---
Honestly my favorite thing about gw2 is the finite end game. Its surprised me how much I enjoy having a definitive end point for like gear and such after playing wow for so long and having to constantly worry about keeping up with the next level cap increase or ilvl increase. Its also nice to not have to ignore other games because I feel obliged to spend all my free time on the game im subbed to. With guild wars 2, the lack of a sub helps me feel good about playing other games at the same time

They are on sale at this very moment but only for a few hours more.

Did they ever fix Xiuquatl? Or does the lizard still just lazily and unrealistically stick to your side with the same animation no matter what.

Get a solid pack of tissues and do Knight of the Thorn. You will heal in time.

I had participated in many amazing raids with amazing people in WoW and FFXIV and was surprised that the encounter that proved more epic than them was a relatively easy (mechanics wise) battle against a chubby draconic creature with only two NPC as my buddies. The emotional investment built up by the story and the wonderful music ensured a level of immersion I had never experienced before.
---
It all came crashing down soon after the fight but I was prepared for that, courtesy of an accidental spoiler. Much harder to swallow was going to the forums to check people’s thoughts and discovering the ridiculous amounts of hate towards Trahearne. Yes, he does have annoying aspects – bad voice acting direction (it was the first time I ever changed language because the voice acting grated on my nerves\*), bad lines, bad AI, etc., but I find the zeal with which people hop on the hate wagon an interesting and a little disturbing quirk of human nature. One person even asked why Trahearne didn’t turn against us so they could hate him even more :)
---
\* I changed from German to English because German monotone is more annoying than English monotone. I know that both actors are good, they just lacked direction. I actually love their voices and that ArenaNet worked with the English VA to fix what they could.
---
Are you aware that just one month ago we actually got new map? And new (temporary so far) 2vs2 gamemode event? The trend to get new things is actually there, you just choose to not see it.
---
I think the actual mobs are just off camera having a fight between thenselves
---
Discoveries from crafting is some of the fastest XP gains in the game, and it makes a nice break from killing things. Definitely worth giving it a try. Especially some of the cheaper ones like cooking, and jewelcrafting.
---
Dont forget you were also in there answering questions to the chat, giving helpful advice even through the frustration.  As a viewer, I'd rather you not play a game bc you have to keep the stream up if its a shitty day.  The ragequit gave the chat a good laugh and a shrug, so I wouldnt feel bad about it.

I could probably put my favourite ones on a Google drive folder for you. I downloaded a few from that thread. Mine focus on making the game look nicer and sharper though, no funny graphic effects.
---
If it would be any use?
---
I think I use vivid lighting V2 as default?
---
The first time I went back to WoW my first thought was "how do I avoid attacks?!", before remembering the sad truth.
---
I've not crafted it yet, but I want to. It is the only legendary weapon I currently feel that I really want to have and use.
---
It doesn't matter where you pulled it from, just because you found it on google doesn't mean you can use it. Even if you use it and credit the author (which btw is https://www.deviantart.com/magicnaanavi )
---
doesn't mean you're allowed to use it.
---
For all I know I sent a message to the author on deviantart telling him someone stole his art. If he copystrikes you on steam it's entirely up to him.
---
He should not even be doing the hearts if he dont enjoy them. There is no must in this game. He should first of all focus on events. All events that pops us. They give the most xp. But also be aware of that you get xp for anything. Gathering, events, exploring, mapcompletion, hearts, world bosses, crafting, story, dungeons, everything give xp. Even in PvP and WvW you get something called tome of knowledge. It is a slower but if he is a pvp person then tell him to try that out.
---
So push him out of the tunnelvision and ask him what he likes and then go and do that. I have this long wall of text on what to do when leveling that i usually paste when people ask about it but i dont want to hijack this thread so i leave a link for you to look at and save and get back too https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a3qzfb/first_mmo_super_intimidated/eb90wxf/
---
Yeah i would really like it if they added some kind of effect to the spear. I mean i guess i get the effect if the legendary but compared to the other skills its pretty lame.
---
Ended up loving all of them. 
---
If I were to restart on a new account, I would make Claw of the Khan-Ur before any others. So I suppose if I had to pick one, that would be it. 
---
Well i did really like the wings you can buy ingame but now i think i'm spoiled xD
---
I'd say Astralaria is probably the prettiest although HOPE is easier to work into a character's appearance. My full list: 
---
- Have made: HOPE, Nevermore
---
- Probably going to make: Astralaria, Shining Blade
---
- I like it, but I can't really work it into my characters: Chuka and Champawat, Xiuquatl, Ipos
---
- It's just OK: Eureka, Verdarach
---
- I like the Gen 1 better: Claw, HMS Divinity, Shooshadoo, Sharur
---
- Nope: Flames of War
---
For pure profit, the spreadsheet will tell you.  I keep multiple tools with different glyphs and then even more glyphs in the bank so I can switch to what I seek.
---
What to use depends on what you want.  For example, as you might already know, bounty is best for flax and any other valuable plant.
---
But what if you need some unbound magic for ascended trinkets?  Gathering berries is fast and easy but if you don't like it, just put on glyphs and you'll get it.
---
I always need volatile magic for the maps.  I don't use it for profit because I only have enough for just getting the special perks on each map.  I can't stand doing Istan.  This means while most people have tons and use volatile magic for sheer profit, I don't have hardly any. (I just find it incredibly boring and completely unfun to do giant zerg events).  So I equip volatile magic glyphs until I have enough for the next living story.  For example 10k is needed for home instance alone.  
---
So basically, which glyph you use depends on what you want.  For profit, it's easy, check the spreadsheet.  
---
I like having a bunch of glyphs because I have different wants and this way I can change as I want.  As a side note, while I got prospector, it's one of the few glyphs I rarely ever use.  But for someone who really wants more ore, it could be okay.  Just keep in mind that if you make enough profit with something else, you can use the profit to buy what you seek.  
---
Recently crafted it and it really is a great legendary. Only thing that bothers me is how small the footfalls and the arm aura are on a maximum sized bulky charr. On asuran characters the shards on your arm are probably the same size as those on a charr, I wish they scaled a bit.
---
Her page says I do not have to ask.... I was ignorant to her art request as the image I pulled was not even from Deviantart. It’s been rectified. Besides it’s a free item for anyone to use,
---
This game does so many things right.
---
Here is what works for me:
---
First, make a copy of your vanilla gw2 install and rename it to something like gw2reshade. Now you happily can tweak this copy - if something does not work, just delete  and restart with the vanilla version. Saves a lot of time and hazzle :). 
---
Make sure to start the game from the right gw2.exe ;). 
---
Download and install as instructed gw2hook and the shader package from here:
---
https://04348.github.io/Gw2Hook/
---
--
---
Download this preset here and install (so much thanks to Mehrune for this gem):
---
http://www.filedropper.com/vividlightingpreset-v12_1
---
This is from woodenpotatoes reshade mega threat, right the first one there:
---
 https://amp-reddit-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/amp.reddit.com/r/WoodenPotatoes/comments/6xa734/giveaway_and_megathread_guild_wars_2reshade_30/?usqp=mq331AQGCAEoAVgB&amp;amp_js_v=0.1
---
Then use the gw2hook and ingame settings described here:
---
https://sfx.thelazy.net/games/preset/8220/
---
Leaves me awestruck everytime I log in, but as always with things like this - you might disagree. 
---
Also be aware that the loading time in the character screen is a bit longer as all the shaders need to load (for me this takes like an additional 4 secs). 
---
Bumping up - could anyone explain this for those who aren't up to date with WoW state of things?
---
&gt; Elite Specializations
---
I think that's a bit debatable due to some still sticking with vanilla. And the level 20 aspect does give you (IMO) a feel for what the class is, albeit lightly. 
---
I personally used it as a decider in the beginning but went on to buy more slots and have level 80s (all specialized) of most of the classes. AND.. well most did match up with my initial feelings, I still didn't like the a few that I disliked at early levels. I will say though boosting temp to Lv 80 if available helps more if OP can do that. But again I don't think specializations are imperative to many PVE situations (AKA base classes work fine) roaming PVE especially. Such as my Engi, Holo isn't extremely useful in most situations and Scrapper isn't considered that great of a kit. 
---
But to each their own!

Or Asura.

"Download 4k wallpaper size! COMMERCIAL USE IS NOT ALLOWED!!! FOR PERSONAL USE ONLY!!!!! IF YOU SHARE THIS, REMEMBER TO LINK BACK TO MY DEVIANTART, INSTAGRAM &amp; MY TUMBLR PAGE! Thank you"
---
Personal use means taking it and using it for something like your OWN wallpaper. Taking her work, modifying it a little then uploading it on steam so that others can use it via a paid software then asking for donations on reddit falls under commercial use.
---
I like astralaria, xiuquatl, and ipos allot. Kinda wish they'd buff astralaria foot falls though
---
&gt;they're fucked.
---
or they just pay 200gems per episode and farm. How much would 200gems in gold?
---
Got that one with my 13th key (10keys+Blticket deal from before and weekly farm). It noce, but didn't actively hope for it. On the other hand, I felt like I "had to have" the shrine jackal last spring and had to use 76keys to get it (10€+ gold-to-gems). RNG is a cruel. :'D
---
Are even enough buttons in the gamepad to play gw2? I mean skills only you will need 15 buttons. That without having into account interface actions, mounts, movement actions, etc.... 
---
Genuinely curious, which part of the story do you find "jaw dropping"? I find it to be a very average story so far, the latest part has been mildly interesting with the rift tears, but I've never found it that engaging, even for an MMO. Everything seems to be an anti-climax.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9w1pbk/complete_xbox_controller_support_for_gw_super_fun/
---
That's intended so it's the same. It does have a walk animation and strafe though
---
Sharur is really nice in an understated sort of way.  Also the rarest.
---
I get why the flashier ones are more popular, but I feel that they also really pigeonhole you on a particular look.
---
That's why Tera will forever be my favorite combat system of any MMO (personal opinion). It had the holy trinity of tank/healer/dps, but still very fast and what felt impactful action-combat where you had to actively dodge or block attacks (honestly I had more fun tanking in Tera than in any other MMO). And the weight of the weapons felt awesome, sometimes GW2 feels "too floaty" with how easily characters can freely move while whirling around with giant hammers/greatswords, in Tera you really felt the Oomph of the heavy weapons.
---
Thanks for your time. If you have direct contact with this creator, please let her know I sent her a direct message on Instagram (only way I could find to easily contact). Attempting to rectify this misunderstanding.
---
Thanks either way.
---
Stop stalking me Teh, goshhh. 
---
Ipos \o/
---
Makes me wish focuses could be mainhand weapons as well.
---
It’s much Sadler to get Gift of Battle now that your participation never goes down if you leave WvW. Once you get it to Tier 6, it stays there. 
---
Other than that, I just do the easy dailies and save up the potions so I can complete the reward track whenever I want. 
---
That's true, as long as you have mf stones left and attach no other value to them, mystic will always be better because of the lower cost per use.
---
make sure to check the comments there, for alternative binds, you might like them more.
---
I don't really understand the spreadsheet, mind telling me which i should use for pure profit? And thanks a lot for the answer!
---
Raids aren't gated behind ascended gear, you could clear all wings with just exotics, it'll only take longer and would require you to do (more) mechanics.
---
On the other hand, you literally can't do T4 fractals in a full exotics group, as the agony mechanic will oneshot you without the agony infusions you can put into only ascended gear. That's why fractals are the only actually gear-gated content.
---
Malibu Barbie does acid at a rave. Killed it xD
---
I don't consider that a treadmill, you start out with the 2nd best gear and have to make one upgrade and you're done.  A treadmill is where each update to the game gives you another tier you need to unlock to be back to "normal" power
---
That is true, if you are deciding what ascended pieces you should get first, weapons and accessories are a small amount better, but that wasn't his main point. His main point was that they are "absolutely necessary for fractals", he was talking about the stat increase from exotic to ascended which isn't the case at all. The stat increase is fine but not required, its the agony resistance that matters.
---
I often found it was easier to break out of the map to get to where i needed to be rather than actually try and navigate it
---
Sharur, but hammer is useless.
---
Gear grinds exist in GW2. A gear treadmill does not. 
---
No way. If your already using 2 healers you're already using safe strats might as well grab a better healer. If you were concerned about damage you'd run one druid
---
whatever you are wearing, it's not berserker's armor.
---
berserker's armor gives ferocity, 15 (correct me if i'm wrong) points each of which grant 1 additional % of critical damage. the base line for critical damage is 150%, which you are supposedly at. in other words, according to your description you have zero additional ferocity from gear (or traits for that matter).
---
That is correct. Same thing where the templates don’t save Ranger pets.
---
I think you should limit the game pad to movement/mount/combat. There's a lot of interface in GW2 I think is not compatible with game pad or Arrow Key binds. And Ranger is very easy to play so DPS builds will be fine. Now you can get away with a lot if you configure the in-game keybinds and settings for your AoE attacks and Auto Target on skill press, snap ground targeting to Enemy and more. And there is a Action Cam function that may be nice for her to use with this set up. So enjoy!
---
Hate that the Nevermore arm affect is not good on Charr... it's really unique, it's like darkness is acting exactly alike light.
---
With your translation anything you do in the game is a grind. Because there is litterally nothing you only do one or a few times. If this is what you don't like the i say you will find it very hard to find any game out there who can offer you a one time thing were you get everything instantly. That game will also be very short. 
---
I didn't see it that way, but you are probably right. She does not need permanent access to all the "interface" buttons. A move/combat focus on the pad should be enough, and for the rare instances where she needs to open the map or inventory or something, she can get back the keyboard (who will be plugged in anyway).
---
And yes, action cam will be a must ! Thanks.
---
Between salvage all options, being able to salvage rubes and sigils, and unidentified gear meaning all the random equipment you pick up sits in a single inventory space, things are far, far better.
---
How to Clear Your GW2 Cache:
---
Exit Guild Wars 2.
---
Find your “Temp” folder. It will be at “C:\Users\{YourUserName}\AppData\Local\Temp” by default.
---
Find your GW2 cache folder. It will be “gw2cache-{randomNumbersHere}”. (Well not so random but we won't get into the details.)
---
Delete this folder.
---
Run Guild Wars 2.
---
Thanks for the detailed answer mate! My goal would be parking a lot of alts at the elder wood spot in malchor's leap and gather there(using shared inv slot to pass  the  Ace) plus sometimes i do gathering routes(with only 1 char) to brisban(iron) sparkfly and mount maelstrom(platinum). Which do you suggests for these? Ik it will take very long to earn the golds back, but i don't like the idea to be gathering at less than max potential. Thanks again.
---
Autofill group system with some settings might work. Settings would be: Roles, specific roles for encounter (tank, green circles etc.), minium amount of LI, minium amount of KP etc.
---
After going back and looking at the derivation of information it is clear he was not implying anything about the agony resistance, the comment he was replying to was making the argument that the stats don't matter it is the agony slots that do. He was directly refuting that statement with an argument about the importants of the stats. He was only talking about the stats.
---
The objective is indeed that she is not overwhelmed. And I could make her play on keyboard/mouse, but she really dislikes it.
---
That is why I was trying to find an "easy" pad config for her to play with.
---
&gt; I might have judged too soon
---
I have tried watching him on and off for month, you didn't. He gets carried by Holo which infaltes his ego way too much.
---
&gt;With your translation anything you do in the game is a grind.
---
Please google "grinding in a game" because what I provided is the standard definition. And had you read my post to the very you would also know that grind is not a bad thing. And you literally know nothing about how I perceive grind.
---
No, you haft to play WvW where loot is somewhat minimal (especially while playing support Firebrand).  I usually end up deleting a ton of drops during events (halloween, wintersday).
---
So yes, there is still too much loot. But praise be to Inventory Management 2 and our new salvage-o-matics
---
What dany011016 said, there's a statue of dwayna with a bunch of elder wood trees. There are dozens farming it at a time, can't miss it!

I don't much care whether it leads to players earning more gold from it or not, my main issue is the stagnation. Where 9/10 items are just gonna sit in the TP and never move move (unless your going out of your way to undercut, which just makes everything worse).
---
I agree that its unlikley to change and as i said i can't really think of way to fix it without giving Anet a heap of work to do.
---
I agree. I play kitless sword/pistol build (AED too) everywhere, in raids, dungeons and Fractals. It plays smoothly, and it is super fun and easy to play!
---
I thought the stat difference went from 5% to 10% 2-3 years ago to add more reason for ascended

PSA: Those of you who level boost to 80 instantly and are new to the game. Know that the full exotic level gear you get from that is not the best choice which I believe is Power-Vitality-Toughness. Just know that if you have a difficult time to solo parts of the story in any expansion consider using "Berserker" stats Power-Presicion-Ferocity to kill enemies like 10x faster. If you don't want to feel like a glass cannon then "Marauder" stats Power-Precision-Vitality-Ferocity is nice. Also get to know the gw2 wiki it has literally everything you need to know about an item or general information. I recommend visiting these 2 links to understand how [Boons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Condition) and [Conditions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Boon) work in this game. 
---
They should rework the loot boxes and caches used in PvP and HoT to simulate MF-affected enemy drops with container to ve less varied and stack more, and be salvageable like PoF's unidentified gear. 
---
Unidentified gear can be opened for a chance of rarer drops if you have high magic find, or salvaged to get more materials, and there's only 3 types: Fine, masterwork and rare.
---
There's at least 2 HoT lootbox and cache for each type of enemy in HoT (veteran and campion mordrem, mordrem guard, saurians, mushrooms, itzel, chak, etc), and PvP has at least 2 for eeeeevery family of enemies.
---
They should reduce them to just 3 for each core region, and 3 for each expansion.
---
There's just way too many. 
---
Appreciate the info!
---
I got it a few weeks ago, it was the first box i opened in months, i wasn't sure of how rare or valuable it was, looks like its pretty good :v
---
I recently leveled to 80 naturally as a new GW2 player and I never had to bounce around.  I did every event, heart, HP, PoI, Vista, and personal story that I came across and map completed every zone before moving to the next.  I never really felt a grind and I immensely enjoyed the almost limitless variety of terrain, buildings, towns, cities.
---
As for boosting.  I couldn't even imagine boosting as a new player.  Even once I made it to lvl 80 there were so many things I still had no clue about.  Even now, 8 months later, I have a full set of ascended  armor and two weapons with agony resist nearing 100 and I have never done a raid, pvp, or wvw.  I'm just slowly following the story while I built up my crafting to make my ascended equipment.  I am about to start LW4.
---
When I look back at it.  Getting to lvl 80 is just the beginning, sort of an apprenticeship, a time to learn the game and your character.  Once you get there, then the fun starts.
---
 Astralaria &amp; Ipos 
---
Shattered if you don't spend money/gold in order to purchase the missing parts. Like that you get personal story, GOW and POF stories and latest LW episodes, anything else in between is locked behind paywall for newcomers, which could be crucial for them to decide whether they want or not invest their money/time into the game.
---
Agree - without Agony Resistance (which you can only add to Ascended gear) you won’t survive in T4 Fractals,  but Raids are doable in Exotic gear. Your raid group may gripe about it (especially PUGs) but they’re doable if you learn the mechanics of the raid and how your power rotations work. That seems more important than anything to the success of both Fracs and Raids honestly - perfect gear doesn’t really help if you don’t know what to do and when to do it. :)
---
I guess Astralaria is the favorite one. I don’t understand why but that’s is what it’s is :D
---
Though I do wish the effects on the weapon and not the arm were seen when stowed as well.
---
Having to pop a skill so I can see how sexy and shiny the axe is gets old after a while :(
---
I was talking Level 80 Exotics, that’s true - they come in lower-level variants with lower stats. 
---
Soulcleave + AP is more dps than GoE and spotter typically.
---
i still don't get what you want changed
---
do you want exotics to be more expensive and all the items below exotic to..stop existing?
---
&gt; to the point where a piece of iron is worth more than an armful of iron swords
---
what? what does this even mean?
---
Money
---
going from full exotic zerkers to ascended is 12-15% dps increase
---
If you're using this for general PvE, try something like [this build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vJQQNAnXRnUJCdfg1eAedAcigBigS/inIGsAICGAsF67VA-jRCBAB5pvBgTpQlqVQ0+DjqqCWKPOTJYAPpgyUiFA4A48m38zz8zP/8nf+5nf+5d95nf+5nf+5nf+5lCIilRA-e), it's got plenty of damage, auto CC break, buffs allies with the banners, plus you get a friendly doggo. For open world stuff just replace the banners with Signet of Fury and Signet of Might. If you need to CC, replacing greatsword with mace/mace or even hammer does the job.
---
Good luck :3
---
As someone who has played GW2 for awhile and recently attempted a stint in WoW the best advice I can give is that GW isnt like wow in that you almost have to pick a main because of how separate each character is. GW isnt like that. For many things all of your characters are just extensions of each other. Things involving map completion and most gathering are per character but everything else is per account. It doesnt penalize you for making one class your dps class and another to play support (in fact I think its easier to keep them separate because you dont have to carry as much stuff around). 
---
Outside of raids there are no tanks (and all that means in gw is that this is the person the boss follows around, not all raids even have a set tanking mechanic, but any class can technically tank because it is based only on having a certain stat on your gear, toughness). 
---
While leveling you will want to just run power dps.. doesnt matter what class you pick.. picking power stats is the way to go, it will make things much faster. Once you get to 80 some classes will be better suited to condition based damage and you can swap then. Leveling in gw is much easier than in wow. You dont just sit there and do quests.. You run around and kill things and do events that you run across or find new places.. whatever you want to do really. 
---
I've seen other NPCs do this also. It's quite hilarious when the AI goes derp-tastic. 
---
Next year around halloween most likely. 
---
Can it?
---
Or gw2
---
Make sure your arcdps is fully up to date. Remake the templates that are causing you problems.
---
Finally, a big thing that affected whether or not build templates will work is a weird change ArenaNet made a couple of months ago that makes it impossible to change out of an elite spec while one of the spec's abilities is on cooldown. For example, if you use gravity well on chrono, you can't swap to mirage until your gravity well is off cooldown. This majorly screws with build templates because it can't swap to mirage, locking you out of the elite spec weapon, traits, and utilities.
---
I love the pale ghostly wings that the DH gets on the F2 skill. Though I am glad that they are only a brief flash rather than a persistent skin. They would be as obnoxious as stacked infusions if they were persistent. 
---
Not to my knowledge
---
but you should use flamethrower for tagging anyway so why not pick rifle for the mobility?
---
If you're in NA I can help you
---
As i said i don't no how to fix it, but anyhing below exotics already basically don't exist, their only use is to gain xp.
---
" to the point where a piece of iron is worth more than an armful of iron swords " 4 iron swords made from over 10 iron each cost less gold than one piece of iron ore, despite requiring significantly more work and being at the end of the crafting chain. Which is completely backwards, thats like having a $5 wooden table next to a single $20 plank of wood. hat doesn't make much sense does it?
---
My first instinct is "absolutely not." Because that was a mastery from HoT and we're in PoF territory now. They wouldn't include stuff that can't be accessed by that expansion.
---
But then, like you pointed out, we *did* get the bouncing mushrooms and updrafts in Jahai. So it's not impossible.
---
I doubt Kodan will be down there. They really haven't breached into the southern maps of the Shiverpeaks, so maybe the Deldrimor Front is a bit out of their range.
---
But yeah, I think it's important for ANet to include at least minor abilities from previous expansions. Just that little nod to players who have been through it all without giving them some ridiculous advantage.
---
On a different note, though, I am also interested to see if we'll find any connection between the new map and the underground pipeline we find at the bottom of [Whorl Lagoon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Whorl_Lagoon) in Bitterfrost.
---
For the elder wood you could swap the bounty to your axe and be set.  Swap back when done there.
---
If you do want another glyph forester would work.  It is barely behind leatherworker for t5 wood and is same price as prospector.  Volatile is also in a pretty good spot across tiers right now.
---
Initially, I did not think about prospector potentially giving silver/gold in addition to iron.  I don't have prospector glyph to test, but I assume that this is the case, which hurts the return.
---
Mystic has always and always will beat Silver-fed. The kits are functionally identical and Mystic have always been cheaper per use. It's literally impossible for silver-fed to have ever been more efficient. Anyone who was using it was doing so for the infinite uses out because they didn't have Forge stones to make Mystic kits, which continues to be the only benefit to the item.
---
You have some mad drawning skills \^\^ that looks great :D
---
Good to know, thanks! The ones I got were on sale, being still directly by Amazon.
---
thats 3 clicks minimum every time you want to clean up your inventory, vs 1 time setup for the entire lifespan of a character.
---
Imagine not having to manually clean up your inv ever time you open a boss chest, do some crafting or run a dungeon.
---
They exist because some filthy elitists have an obsession to complete everything as fast as possible, saving merely 10 seconds from a daily run. Potions limit Fractal accessibility because almost every T4 LFG requires potions nowadays.
---
Remove potions and redesign/remove agony system or make agony resistance account-wide.
---
100g alone is *quite* a lot for a new player to get. It's almost a life saving for them, to just give up to 400 gems.
---
&gt; I don’t understand why
---
Because space. And space is amazing. :)
---
The stat increase only equates to a 6% change, if you look at the numbers for an exotic helm and and ascended helm the ascended version is 6% better. The increase in effectiveness ends up being higher than the base stat increase due to the multiplicative effect of stats like precision. If you are using full berserk gear for instance, the 6% increase across the board would mean an average of about 8% damage increase because you are criting more often and your crits deal more damage.
---
If we were looking at gear with just power it would be a flat increase equal to the increase of the stat itself. Berzerker gear fully speced out has the potential of a 12.5% increase in DPS but this isn't usually achieved, due to the precision not really being a flat increase and people making mistakes with DPS rotations.
---
Can't really complain about not having spirits since you can just take a soulbeast. I mean the really good statics guilds run without one anyway so your assumption that a 4th dps is better is not really new and also very correct. The current record on is it 99cm? Kinda proves it as well. In the end you always have pugs that care about Meta even though it's a pug group and the maximum you get out of the Meta will never be reached. I think anets balance patches lately have shaken some things up and I am hoping to see more versatile group comps after next patch 
---
Perhaps i didn't spend $30 on bag slots?
---
But when you run with pubbies, theres always atleast two power gamers that refuse to wait up and let everyone sort their inv. Regardless, do you enjoy stopping to manage your inv every 5 minutes?
---
I already said its probably not worth the effort, does everyone on this thread just only read the first half of each phrase?
---
Thxs
---
M e t a 
---
I could see that. You just were talking like you were someone important while clearly is not the case. 
---
I've been playing this some and it's been mostly nice. I miss the WoW rp though. As I haven't really found much of that going on in GW2. Though a friend of mine said he only knows of one place and it's mostly just the same as Moonguard Goldshire according to him.  
---
Also picking a class is pretty tough as I keep wanting to goof with new things.
---
No one knows you. It's cringey as fuck you talk like we should. 
---
You only proved the guy was right. Congratulations. 
---
What if all dies (even Kralky) but not the commander? That would be sad.
---
I don't farm keys either and I got the Kitsune jackle skin when that was going around. It's a great feeling :)
---
I'm really torn, because I know I'll probably only have the will to make one.
---
I love Ipos for how dark and unique it is. Blows me away.
---
I love Claw of the Khan-Ur for the effects and the lore. Billowing smoke is such a perfect aura for it.
---
While I was originally hoping for Scepter of Orr, I do love Xiuquatl. So unique and indulges in that fleeting Mayan theme that has been underlying in parts of both GW1 and GW2.
---
Almost all of the others are beautiful too. But Gen2 legendaries are really frustrating to make. So I'll have to see what I decide on.
---
It is probably a Dredge exhaust pipe.
---
Won't be taking part as I'm god awful at pvp but up voted for you guys doing great things for both the community and the game mad respect xoxoxo
---
Okay so this might come off a bit rude but I really don't mean to be.
---
The reason everyone (including me) is so against this idea is because it's currently not impossible to learn raids. It's not like you can't find people who will teach you the encounters for everything. People already linked some good resources with the Snow Crows website for training raid discords. You can also sometimes find training raids on LFG, join them and wipe over and over until you learn how to do it. How do you think everyone else learned to raid? They weren't just good all of a sudden and able to do the raid. That includes myself, I wiped hundreds of times on each boss during training raids to learn each of the wings. I went to the Special Forces Training area to work on my rotations for every single class to output top tier DPS. Why should someone else have the ability to just jump right into easy mode when I just spent a good chunk of my time learning everything?
---
Easy mode raids are never a good idea and will never be implemented. It would hurt everyone who has taken the time to learn the encounters and work on their rotations; spending their own time, time you don't want to spend, doing the actual work required to raid. Maybe raiding isn't for you and that's fine, but don't trivialize my work and the work of every other raider just because you don't want to put the same time and effort into an end game activity.
---
Nope, participation does not decay now. This was added in the last patch or the one before, can't exactly recall. Oh, and you cannot buy it with badges of honor, only thru the reward track. It's really not so bad if you take your time with it.
---
I'm taking a break from WoW of undertermined length and coming back to GW2.  I'm playing a Minion Master Reaper with berserker stats and loving it.  I'm melting the faces off of level 80 Veterans when in Death Shroud and my build still isn't complete.
---
Yes, with the dearth of content for WvW, I can understand how people can have become bored. Many are now subscribing to the awful credo of PPK-only, and it's ruined much of the game for others since their vocal forum whining got Arenanet to change the game to suit them, i.e. Arrow cart nerfs, Points just for killing enemies, etc. -If that was hard to follow, a small minority sect of the population whined about defending objectives being a feasible way to play and that they'd rather kill people in the open for points - they made Anet change the game, and now they claim superiority over the old playstyle. WvW is in a sorry state.   
---
Regardless, I went off-topic and wish to say happy new year and well done on all of those legendaries, @That\_Treasure\_Hunter.

But a Kodan settlement could be displaced because of what's happening in the mists. :) Also, I wouldn't be surprised if they were a group of Kodan that journeyed far south, no one expected Charr to be in Elona, but then we found the Omakan. ;-P

More than 500 now but the victim complex is strong

I'm more or less in the same situation, you can add me :-) 
---
"Alio Sha" is one of my characters name. It me up in game! 
---
I read all, and I'm just giving my opinion here. I don't have characters with maxed inventory, all have 100 slots from Halloween bags. I don't stop either, I have my inventory minimised to the side and I click salvage and deposit there without having to stop doing whatever I'm doing on the meanwhile.
---
Swim to the bottom of the spring. You'll see. It's artificial.
---
Second this. Leave auto attack in PvE on and keybind a stow weapon (mine is on shift for example). Stowing is also useful to interupt some aftercast animation, which can speed up parts of your rotations.
---
Introducing new salvage kits for runes and sigils, reworking their crafting and salvage mechanics and encouraging us to FURTHER specify which type of gear should be broken with each salvage kit (i.e. runecrafters for those items with upgrades).
---
Doesn't sound like it's good
---
I'm on the same page, I frequently play by myself because my friends rarely log on. I t would be great to play with more people.

Unfortunately only for another like 8 hours. Which makes me sad as I don't get paid until tomorrow....
---
&gt; Although I did play High burst classes in WoW so I do have a soft spot for some beast single target damage in pvp.
---
In pvp nothing beats [deadeye](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Deadeye_-_Marauder_Rifle)'s single target burst. But unfortunately thief can only fill one role regardless of build or elite specialization so it may not be the best fit for you.
---
I think you'd enjoy guardian. Can play anything from [burst](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Radiant_Hammer) to [healer](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Firebrand_-_Mantra_Bunker).
---
PvP can be played even as a lvl 1 character tho so as long as you don't mind multiclassing you don't have to stick to one class for it. Could even have a class you play in PvP and one you play in PvE.
---
You're totally right, I never thought oh that with the Kodan but it makes sense.
---
Make a warrior. Get him full exotics, go to [snowcrows.com](https://snowcrows.com) or the website of any prominent raiding guild, apply the build. Learn it on golem. Use your warrior to finish Tyria to get the hang of it. 0 specs needed. Always wanted. What server? I might be able to get you into a guild. 
---
The warrior will help you farm raids or at least Wing 1 (Spirit Vale) and Wing 4 (Bastion of the Pertinent)
---
For a second I thought you were being an incel-lord or something but I just read her username to make sure. 
---
Came back to GW2 after a 3 year vacation.  I played for a couple of months back then and got 1 level 80 Guardian and a 40 Mesmer for my time.
---
Logging back into those two a couple of weeks ago was amazing!  I had forgotten how much I liked GW2.  The only reason I left it was that lore is very important to me, and WoW had such rich and deep lore, and GW2 made no sense to me 3 years ago.
---
I did a lore primer in December when I picked up the game again, and what a difference that made!!! I know where I fit in.
---
Other than the Lore, GW2 is superior in almost every respect to me!  Graphics, Mounts, Animation, builds, class diversity, talent/skill/equipment/build diversity, rewards profusion, exploration rewards, fast travel, PVP is amazing, and so on.
---
I'm in hog heaven right now!  No regrets.  BfA killed WoW for me for good.  Long live GW2!
---
Mayby not profitable but if you need the Order Collections, it's a extra reason to do them, safes a few gold to spend else :)
---
Ah okay. Didn't play much WoW so I forgot it was an issue there.
---
*Li-be-riiiis, Bal-tha-zaaaar....*
---
high burst, versatile, can re-spec in to support, good mobility and utility 
---
guardian 
---
I thought I stated in the first sentence that was my opinion. You play what you like of course. For me, aesthetically speaking (and also in terms of gameplay, but that's another thread) is ugly. If you like butterflies and blinks, feel free to play mesmer, I won't hunt you in game as a muscular hairy norn to question your masculinity 
---
Additionally, if you play the level 60 story mission on claw island, you get another BL key.
---
There's also one story mission in HoT that gives a key, but I can't remember which ones and it's not terribly profitable to do that weekly...
---
&gt; Do you get more mastery by advancing the plot?
---
Yep.
---
Lemme make a 15 years old edgetard subreddit just to showcase your comment.
---
Also long time WOW player. Been playing gw2 for about eight weeks now and I'm loving it! However, while everything else is going really well, I find that group combat is not enjoyable. With all the visual clutter of all the spells, auras and particle effects I can't even see the mob that I have targeted. As a result I don't get the feeling of actual contributing to the boss fight. Does anyone have any tricks or tips that will help me improve my experience in fractals or boss fights? I have already installed gw2 hook to reduce the bloom. I also change my graphics setting to turn off animation. However the problem still persists.
---
You threw away engineer a bit too fast because it's the class you are looking for pretty much.

o yes this morning i took a rly nice pic of my feet just after shower i think you will like it (if u like them clean that is)

1. Team Triple Trouble is a Guild of dedicated commanders which runs TT at least twice a day afaik with both text and vocal explanations. Just check the LFG around 30min before it starts. Serpent's Ire is a bit more tricky but I've Seen some guilds running it. Don't know their schedule though.
---
2. There are always people for all of HoT metas, to the point where I suggest you join meta maps at least 10-15 min before they start else you could struggle to get into a succesful one (especially TD). Same for SW and Istan as long as you don't try to join at dead Times like middle of the night.
---
4. I'm but a casual WvW player, actually on Vabbi. For what it's worth I've never seen the main english servers having population issues but I guess a WvW regular can give you a better answer.
---
Welcome to EU anyway :)
---
&gt; I did specifically talk out about crafting materials being worth less than the items they are crafted into. That is another issue. If this happened in real life every single retailer and factory in the world would be forced to close. While in game the only use for crafting is buffs, Exp and the occasional ascended weapon, literally every other recipe is worthless.
---
Idk man... last time i didnt get a car tire when i killed a ant, not a new graphic card from the bug i killed today. Am i just that blind and missed all these juisy juisy drops, or items dont drop like that in real life? Just wondering, please help, its a hard question.
---
Power Greatsword Soulbeast is good stompy smashy times.  You can get yourself a set of heal/boon gear and try Druid for a more support-driven role.  I don't know much about that, though.  I just stick to me smashy stompy.  But I hear it's a good "healer" class.

---
&gt; They wouldn't include stuff that can't be accessed by that expansion.
---
Well, we got some updrafts and bouncing mushrooms in the last episode. Why not being able to use Kodan mastery in the same optional way?
---
I mean we covered that in fact you are getting more loot, and to break it down to get the same reward as in the past it is more convoluted. So...disagree?
---
.... did you read my entire comment?
---
 I only liek dirty feet, but I guess I can put some dirt on my phone/computer screen :))))  
---
yes and no. gw2 doesnt have too much loot. HoT did have an issue with too many different varieties of bags though which was more an annoyance than anything. The loot you get is just a way of creating materials. thats it. the blues and greens are never meant for you to use. 
---
gw2 has alot of issues with its reward system in my opinion, but anything exotic and lower is just material creation and for most people in ascended, anything not ascended is just material creation.

I’ve played WoW on and off since Lich King, and it used to be the only mmo i felt I had time for. I tried GW2 a few years back and had a positive experience but wasn’t grabbed quite strongly enough to quit wow for it, which I would’ve had to do to have the time to play it.
---
But after the general shitshow of BFA, the changes going on at Blizzard right now and their evident lack of any respect for the people who made them what they are, I realized WoW silly isn’t the game it used to be. So I unsubbed a few months ago and have been playing GW2 instead. 
---
Honestly I can’t believe I didn’t do it sooner. No sub fee? So nice. And the way mounts are implemented makes WoW’s mount system look idiotic. I love swooping around on my griffon, sewing how far I can dive before pulling up and soaring halfway across a zone. 
---
I’m not absolutely enraptured by the combat systems in GW2 and I think there are some areas they can improve, but overall it’s still a much more interesting system than WoW. The classes have way more complexity to them and all the specs I’ve tried have a unique feel to them. And like others have said, being able to dodge is A+.
---
In general I like how much better GW is at taking advantage of the whole world they’ve created. I find myself constantly travelling all over the place, whereas in WoW once a new expansion comes out all the old zones become almost completely irrelevant.
---
I know GW2 isn’t perfect, but I would still call it a vastly underrated hidden gem. I feel a lot more challenged here, and I mean that in a positive way. I love how much work is required to obtain Legendary items. In WoW they just threw them around like candy last xpac, everyone had like ten and it totally devalued them and they lost any sense of being special. But looking at the long road ahead of me to obtain Twilight, I’m actually rather excited even though a lot of it is farming.
---
&gt; The bonus XP is based on the amount of time something is alive in the world. The longer it's alive without being killed, the more bonus XP accrues.

YESSSSS I currently have 1 leg and working on my  tier 1 second leg but when i start working towards my tier 2 one this is what im gunna make for sure!
---
You can also get random keys as drop from the gem store when you spend gold or money.
---
Kitless holo isnt really any hard to play. Playing mine with sword and shield in open world and heat management aint really any fuss. Also i find it much stronger than my daredevil and spellbreaker... 
---
So i dont know how good dragonhunter is, but i could surely say you wouldnt make a mistake choosing holo. 
---
Wow, just a stunning piece of work right there. Keep it up! :&gt;
---
Or what you get from leveling up, if I am not mistaken (been awhile) its well enough at low levels. 
---
Shining Blade - Ditched and stashed my Bolt as soon as I saw SB.

H.O.P.E. - its not Quip

Astralaria - just a pretty weapon

Nevermore - birbs

Sharur was an instant craft for me. It’s so beautifully designed, I particularly like the daytime effects. Easily one of my favorites.
---
Greatsword necro has pretty good oomph in my opinion. But I agree, a lot of times weapons look and feel like they have no weight at all.
---
Me and 3 friends buy 50 keys each on halloween/ wintersday events etc.
---
So far, 4 out of 4 had the gryphon skin with halloween. 3 out of 4 had the gekko skin with 50 keys. I am the only one that didnt this time around :).

In other words the droprate isnt so bad.

Huh, that’s neat.

awi thank you boiiii &lt;3

Man that smashy stompy build reminds me of a rabbit thumper build in gw1, basically ranger/warrior that uses expertise and hammer. 
---
Feel free to PM me your API key and I'll take a look
---
I see. If you maintain a decent winrate is it still slower than doing heart quests?
---
char slots? That sale ended about 30 minutes ago sadly.
---
What's wrong dude? You dont like feet &gt;.&lt;
---
It also has a huge QoL improvement IMO. I don't ever have to worry about running out of Salvage Kits while farming. Granted it probably is a net loss, but the QoL is more important to me personally. 
---
Balance on one leg?
---
I lolled hard.
---
In that case increasing the speed may work, either way tuning it so it feels "right" for her is important. 
---
It's the best looking, but I just can't justify making it because I don't like any focus moveset. They're all just so boring.

Hello Friend,
---
I'm a WoW veteran myself. Started in WotLK, ended in BfA.
---
During the WoD I started to lose interest in WoW. Since then towards the end of every expansion I was feeling bored, burned out, couldn't play it anymore. BfA was an exception, I quit in the first raid tier. IDK if it's the game is different now, or I just had enough of WoW.
---
Let's be real, it is the same game, all over and over again. Same shit, just different expansion. +You are allways bound to a small expansion zone and the rest of the world is basically non-existant.
---
What did I do during my wow-vacations? I played GW2! And I do it now.
---
Whoever says GW2 is a cheap copy of WoW - didn't ever play this game. GW2 is absolutely different, incomparable. Boon (buffs) share mechanics, dodging, cc, class combos and much more.
---
During the transition from WoW to GW2 my main issue was - I was trying to compare it to WoW. Don't ever do it. Just accept it as a totally different game. Learn, explore, ask questions.
---
What I dislike about GW2? Probably PvP. It's rly broken now and not because of the PvP itself, but the ranking system,lack of player base, people using bots for gold farming, afkers etc. I'm allmost done with my pvp legendary backpiece. As soon as I'm done - no more of PvP. But hey, we got WvW.
---
PVEwise this game is amazing. There is allways something to do for casual and hardcore players. Also here is so much of content, new players might feel overwhelmed in the beginning. When I just started I had to make a priority list lol.
---
Sorry for my broken english. :)
---
TL;DR: GW2 is Awesome.
---
I was being facetious 
---
You can play both elite specs of a class on the same character. Although, it's terrible to change build without build templates (and they should definitely add it to the game!), but for now we have arcdps to do this easily.
---
I have this issue as well. I’ve heard that opening the AH every once in awhile helps keep you from d/c’ing
---
Damn. So much time wasted. Thanks a lot. 
---
It only awards a key on first-time completion per character though, right? It doesn't give a key *every time you replay it*... does it?
---
Guardian has versatility and a good single-target spike build for PvP / roaming (core medi guard). (And support/tank/dps builds on core / dh / fb in all three gamemodes) 
---
-_- im NOT !! 
---
Well, from what I've seen on GW2 Efficiency, gen2 legendaries are generally more expensive to make than their gen1 counterparts. So some of the frustration is just in the parts that are so gold-draining.
---
Map completion isn't awful but it still makes me wince.
---
The biggest discouragement is the sheer volume of crystalline ingots required. That requires a ton of Dragon's Stand (which I already got pretty burned out on with elite spec weapons), a ton of gold, and a ton of karma. It's just a three-time punch all in one bundle.
---
And I'm just not a particularly hardcore grind-heavy player. I've been doing quick-and-easy LS dailies for karma fairly regularly, but I ultimately need so many obsidian shards for everything too, so it all burns away really quickly.
---
[Everybody disliked that.]
---
I played it a few years back and it was both laggy and empty.
---
If that's changed, I'm Open to giving things second chances.
---
Symbol of swiftness gives.....swiftness
---
&gt; Or maybe they lower drop rates when you buy keys? So you spend more?
---
Nah, you just got lucky the other times.
---
I love GW2 but I can't play for long. Feels like there is nothing to do
---
Right, per character.
---
I would personally recommend at least picking up a copper-fed for everything that's not capable of yielding ectos/upgrade mats, or using purchased kits on those, as the mats they return won't generally be worth enough to cover the cost of salvaging them with the silver-fed in the first place.
---
The core game is free and aside from the daily login reward and trade post restrictions, it's very easy to play and enjoy the base game without spending money on the expansions. Further, gem store items are mostly for convenience or aesthetics. You can't buy better gear or other items that will make you fundamentally better than other players in PvE or PvP so the game offers a very fair playing field for new players.   
---
In terms of gameplay and community, this is the only MMO on the market worth playing, in my opinion, and especially so if you don't want to spend money. Download the game [here](https://account.arena.net/register?alt=gw2&amp;cid=93:5::::Global:40:::).
---
damn dude that looks sick ngl
---
Yeah, that was a while ago for me, though. Maybe it's not as bad as I remember. Life's just been hectic and making big time commitments like DS make me feel guilty that I could be doing something more productive. But who knows?
---
Assuming the gen2 greatsword doesn't absolutely steal my heart, I have some serious decision-making to do. Gen2 had some excellent designs.
---
Absolutely!
---
Besides actually buying the game and the xpacs, I've spent about 10 dollars in total on the game.
---
And that was only before I realised I could convert ingame gold to the gems I could buy for real money.
---
You need never spend real cash, other than purchasing the xpacs these days, where the basegame is f2p
---
You and anyone who has ten bucks and can google "Hanayama cast NEWS".
---
Basically you want mag shards and easier access to ascended items for less than 1/15 the of the effort, you want to the difficulty level on par with T1 fractals or lower cause you cant be bothered to learn basic mechanics for the simplest of raid encounters
---
Buying the expansions is a huge improvement, apart from that you can have a lot of fun without spending further cash.
---

I can confirm, It's where al the anime with good feet pics begin
---
As others in the thread have said, the base game is free, and there's a lot of content in it.
---
On the other hand, IMO, it would be advisible to buy at least the expansions, which are not expensive and provide a ton of new content that is definetely worthy it. 
---
Outside of that you can only spend money on convenience and cosmetic itens. The only one of those that really makes a huge impact in your gameplay is the Salvage-o-Matic (any of them), which is quite cheap.
---
How your parents see it :-P

---
I just wish the game (especially the new expansion areas) didn't have such HORRIBLE lag.
---
I get downvoted every time I bring this up but I have a good computer. It can run most every game on high settings with no issues but ever since the released the xpac even with my graphics set to low there's crazy lag and I'm not the only one effected. 
---
Oh well, I used to love the game but at this point I consider it a lost cause. 
---
Yup. The only money I spent was on expansion, and that's stuff for after you hit max level and finish core story.
---
If only you could be this efficient at dealing dps...
---
OOF
---
I barely played WoW, so I'm not the best to talk about the experience, but I think I can get some core things down.
---
1. Lack of sub fee. Everyone mentions this, but I think it's because this has a huge impact on the desire to play. When life has gotten busy, I have dropped GW2 to focus on what I need to work on for however long it takes. I might only pop on for my dailies at best or I might go into another game if I feel like I need to wind down at the end of a day. I've played sub games before and there was always a pressure to "get my money's worth" each month. Even when I played free trials, there was a sense behind there of "does this feel worth it to me for the $X per month?". With Guild Wars 2, I don't get that feeling of anxiety. I joined in August of 2016, when the core game went free. I leveled up a character and used my experiences to see if it was worth it and it easily was within the first couple days. That's due in no small part to the low, one-time cost. Expansions are easily worth it, particularly PoF, so these sorts of calculations rarely even go on at this point. And, in addition to the content from the actual game/expansions, just logging in means I get free content every 3-4 months in the form of Living World story episodes (which are bordering on expansion-level quantity/quality). Which brings me to the next part...
---
2. Amount of content. I feel like this is an amazing time to be a new player. There is so much content out there to get through. The core level 1-80 story, Living World Season 2, HoT, LWS3, PoF, LWS4. I'm very glad I came in when I did, because I got most of that content for free and would feel so overwhelmed with story backlog at this point!
---
3. Lack of player competition. Simply put, I don't worry that someone else got the last hit on a mob, or has harvested all the resources on a map, etc.
---
They made the entirery of the game available before expansions free, with a few QoL restrictions, but no content restrictions.
---
So you can play almost everything anyone else played before the first expansions, except the first season of Living World free story releases that was temporary and was not made replayable yet.
---
And it's possible to release the restrictions without buying the expansions, if you pay attention to $1 Humble Bundle sales and other cheap or free offers that may include an Heroic Edition key that removes the Play 4 Free limitations. 
---
I think he's referring to the dark old days when blasting in a light field gave area retaliation

There is already a very detailed rotation guide on the internet : [http://gph.is/1Z38iEC](http://gph.is/1Z38iEC)
---
I think you do the quite popular mistake of expecting that GW2 is going to replace WoW you used to play - especially in situation you're just about to join our community. This game is different, it does variety of things differently than other MMOs including the approach to the holy trinity in majority of content. Here we have control/support/dps and each of available professions (including the elite specializations of those) may fit such role with more or less success; but then there are raids and top-tier fractal dungeons where for example, a healing position is welcomed and sometimes required to progress. 
---
Elite specializations change your gameplay - for example, mesmer profession can be trained into chronomancer specialization which provides buff upkeep (tho, some would argue after recent changes...) and can be a tank in raids, or, it can become a mirage that replaces standard rolling mechanic of dodges into blurring on spot effect, has almost unlimited amount of evades and operates axe and condition-based attacks. The professions you listed as ones you aren't interested in also change drastically once a specialization and proper gear is utilized; for each of type of profession (heavy soldier, light scholar and medium adventurer) there's one that can fit variety of roles.
---
Our suggestion is - as always for those who are coming from other games, go try *everything* and get familiar with the game by leveling up character naturally without using instant level-80 booster that comes with either of expansion. Stuff isn't going anywhere and you can always catch-up
---
making my waifu proud since '97 
---
You shouldn't ask reddit or the official forums anything regarding WvW. The majority of users here have absolutely no clue about these gamemodes. In general, this subreddit prioritizes fluff and casual PvE over knowledge particularly regarding pvp / wvw. 
---
While there is an overhaul / restructure "announced", this is only the result of these communities dying years ago and the negative effects it has on the gamemode. This restructure was announced more htan a year ago (!) and will likely not be released in 2019. There was an update post several months ago, that made clear the project has a single dev on it and they're nowhere near done. 
---
Considering WvW has a single dev, no real balancing and got pretty much no updates in 2019 barring a small trap rework; it's no suprise communities are dead. Most community-based servers with pugmanders / various roles / large interaction between players have died. There are several reasons for this (relinks, casuals leeching those communities to death, complete negligence of WvW, ...) but those don't really matter. 
---
The truth is that WvW doesn't have that many guilds anymore, compared to lone casual players looking to jump in and play. It also doesn't have as many commanders, community players, ... anymore. Where previously you had several big international servers with flourishing communities, you now have pretty much none. Of course each server has their "community" still - but for the majority of these servers that community reaches a tiny fraction of their players at best.
---
That said these communities and guilds, despite being a minority in population, still heavily decide who wins / loses / etc. Pugs generally don't have the coherence (nor the skill) to make a real difference and often negatively impact the groups. They also tend not to lead the way or influence others. The activity and skill is still in the hands of the small remaining guilds and communities for the most part.
---
This is incredibly punishing for new communities and start-ups. You will have lots of players very happy to reap the benefits of your efforts - but very few who will stick around when you need them in return. Most players aren't interested in community-based efforts compared to selfish-interests. 
---
This has lead to consecutive bandwagon cycles. They generally go like this : 
---
You have a flourishing community / server like back in the days existing of a few guilds. Even with tiny fractions of players compared to other servers, these often faceroll everything because you have a huge (relative) amount of community players; and many of these players enjoy this type of play. There are no queues in this stage, and lots of enemies. Because these servers are "nice", lots and lots and lots of of casual pugs move there to play with them but refuse to actually play with them. They have no interest in interacting with the community they transfer to - they just want the activity, commanders, skilled allies to carry their ass and bags. Why improve personally or as teamplay if you can leech? This puts a lot of strain on the community (difficulty to organise, queues, difficulty to play together, harder to get into active maps, harder to find enemies willing to fight). Things get worse until the original community is a small fraction of the new bloated bandwagon server. In due time, the original guilds / community gets fed up and leave. 
---
The remaining server often remains "big" for a while, bloated with leeching pugs. Nobody sane goes anywhere near them because the entitlement of the people there is absurd. These servers do not get re-habilitated until left "dead" long enough. They frequently become link servers; which slows the process down as it allows them to leech from other servers depending on RNG. 
---
The majority of casual trash tends to realise their commanders are gone. There is a huge shift in "we're winning everything" towards "we're losing everything", which is generally their queue to leave. They spread out across servers, frequently going to whatever new upcoming servers there are. 
---
There has been an increasing divide between the hypercasual playerbase and the actual communities for example in wvw, raids, ... 
---
Guilds and communities still hold a lot of power in WvW in GW2... But if it's worth the effort? The better you make your community - the faster it'll destroy itself by being perfect for low-effort high-reward demanding players which will come en-masse to the new walhalla. 
---
That is as long as your community accepts pugs. It's no suprise more and more guilds go towards closed-raids and hidden-raids to avoid catering to leeches at all. After all, leeches kill your community. 
---
TL DR : Community based WvW in EU is mostly dead except on 2-3 servers, those servers regularly changing, because casuals leech the communities to death without being willing to interact (in a healthy way) with them. 
---
THATS WHY IM DUDU
---
Small clarification:
---
The autoloot mastery does not work in WvW. You instead need the Provisions Master T4 upgrade, which also requires HoT.
---
Not sure if that's what you meant or not, but it's a somewhat important distinction that's not immediately obvious.
---
hey wait.... u r dudu too..

The ghostly doom tuba, Verdarach, with Binding of Ipos in a very, very close second. I love that tempest lightning skill 5 shoots out a slow moving ghost that shoots out other, smaller ghosts. 
---
The game has been designed to encourage alternating map exploration and story in the first playthrough. 
---
When you hit a wall and can't complete a map, try progressing the story. 
---
When you can't progress in the story, try doing a bit of exploration, or return to places you previously couln't reach.
---
Think of how we'd return to that old road blocked by a rock in Zelda after getting the gauntlets that lift rocks. Mounts also act as a gating mechanism that way. 
---
Probably because Anet promoted Beetle Racing for the last month instead.
---
Double Pack is 10, Mantra is 18, Renegade F1 is 10 with the alacrity trait. FB fills Fury gap with Elite Shout. Should work out, I think.
---
No. You get birthday presents. Save all your characters. I made 6 characters at launch. Deleted all but 1 years later just to join female human meta. Endless regrets.
---
I meant, i have unlocked it in past as medium weight. Did not know i would need the heavy one. Hopefully they understand since i never even use the item. 
---
Yeah same. Some people in my guild have spent hundreds. I've spent maybe £30 in two years, plus the cost of the expansions.
---
Honestly, there's no point in even thinking about paying until you get your first character to 80, by which point you'll know if it's for you or not. 
---
If you're ever in a group and you notice that someone else in the group is friendly, ask about a guild invite. You can be in up to 5, so it's not like you have to commit to one right away. I tried a bunch of guilds over the years before finding the right ones. Of course, I primarily WvW, so it's a little easier to find groups that like that style of gameplay. 
---
&gt; runecrafter
---
this is in between the copperfed and silverfeed.  
---
I'm going to differ slightly from the opinions here and say that while I certainly think it is worth *trying* the free game, you are missing out monumentally without any expansions. The base game is... dated. It's a wonderful world to explore, but very little challenges you meaningfully, the base game story is a hot mess, the core specialisations are not enough compared to the expansions' elite specialisations, instanced group content before level 80 is abandoned by the developers (so full of bugs and outdated mechanics), and it will start to feel like crap running around on two feet while everyone around you is gliding or using mounts.
---
If you want a great experience with the game, the expansions (or at least one of them) is *almost* a necessity, in my opinion. Both expansions raise the bar so much compared to the base game in pretty much all aspects.
---
Having said that, beyond the price of the expansions, the game is absolutely worth playing, even if you don't want to spend a dime. The game's business model is impressively fair, and almost everything on the cash store is either related to cosmetics or convenience. And here's what really knocks it out of the park: you can buy anything on the cash store with in-game gold. I do this regularly and I've very comfortably kept myself up to date with anything I'd ever want from the cash store.
---
If you really imagine that you will like the game, I think long term you should expect that you will want to buy the expansions. The game is just so much better with them than without. There is a LOT of fun to be had before this realization hits you though, but in the long run it’s inevitable.
---
Revenant is not too bad, I have a lvl49 one (my current bag opener), and I enjoyed leveling her with a hammer and Jalis. Ranged AoE and good survivability.
---
When I played it a few months ago it wasn't laggy. Actually, I never noticed *any* lag. In terms of being empty? It varies. Off peak hours average around 400 Alliance vs. 500 Horde. Peak hours, see about a 1000 more people per faction.
---
You misunderstand. The skin is unlocked for all three weights when you get one of them. It is the same skin, but the engine require it to use three separate instances in order to be applied on different weight classes. 
---
You wont need to contact support. If you've already done the meta achievement for Draconic Mons, you'll have the required item. 
---
Just buy another character slot.
---
To add to this: GW2 is the only game I've played where I regularly see devs running around, playing the game. This is a really refreshing thing to see. 
---
Thanks. LOD only affects other players right? I'm trying to retain high enough graphics so that the world environment looks beautiful as it does now to me.
---
Given the two main options I want to distinguish between, about 7000 will do, but really being sure will take about 16k.
---
The long run salvage rate is very dependent on the frequency of 2 and 3 ecto salvages, and those are relatively rare events.  You need a really big sample to beat out the good/bad luck on those.
---
I have not done that
---
For starters you'll want to get a build together for a class of your choice, following the build guides here:
---
https://snowcrows.com/
---
To see comparisons of which class does good DPS, check out the benchmark section here:
---
https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/
---
Now, before you make a solid choices, I definitely suggest checking out what class interests you most or suits your playstyle best. If you wanna do DPS definitely check out Weaver or Deadeye for power builds or Renegade/Berserker/Weaver/Holosmith for condition damage builds. If you like support, Chrono by far or Druid if you wanna be a healer. Although I would suggest waiting until the January 8th update rolls around because there will be nerfs and buffs and the meta could shift.
---
Once you have determined what class/role you want to play, check out the rotation guides on the website and, if you want to play DPS, head on over to the Special Forces Training area in the Lion's Arch Aerodrome and practice, practice, practice. You wanna get semi-close to the numbers you see on the benchmarks, within the 85-90% range and you should be good to go.
---
Then go here and find a raid training Discord in your region (NA or EU) and join it, this will be where you communicate with raid trainers to learn raid wings/bosses:
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/
---
Most importantly, good luck on your journey and don't get discouraged. It takes time to learn raids and no one just woke up one day and was an amazing raider. We all went through this at some point.
---

I am a GW veteran since Prophecies, I have never played WoW, and never has most of the player base here. That being said, this subreddit is a giant circlejerk of bias and everyone here is just riding the hate train. This "community" is garbage and anyone of relevance from the dev original team has left the game minus O'Brian who will ride this wreck out into the sunset. 
---
I find it funny how MMO players are like people who follow religion, and all they ever do is try to convert other people to play their game because it's superior. The reality is that GW2, like any other MMO is dying and failing to bring in new players because the "pool" of MMO users diminishes each year. Hence all the squabbling instead of celebrating gaming and games as a whole. MMO developers are desperate for new players but they aren't going to get any because in their in-fighting for retention, these games adopted gameplay systems that inherently require a long-term time investment and incentives for only dedicating your time to their MMO. Ironically, it's these systems that deter new players because people that have lives and want to enjoy other games to no surprise are unwilling to drop everything and join a cult-like community like GW2. I remember when this game launched with that bizarre, cringeworthy, completely unrelated to GW trailer and the community then (in 2012) was completely in shock. I think that same trailer with the audience of this game today would be praised. It was that trailer which pretty much signaled what was to come and what the target audience for this game would be; the PC SJW community of social outcasts and victimized millennial's who would take solace in the glory that is GW2. 
---
I remember when Guild Wars had lore, story, art direction, a plot and conformed to a specific vision. Now everything is off the rails, flavor of the times, and all we have are furries and wings galore. 
---
HOPE.  Pew pew.
---
Oh yeah, you're right! I think they replaced the one used in the instance when they [had it recorded live](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3JlJBxypYo). The Soundcloud track wasn't replaced and the new one wasn't uploaded probaby because it's for sale. Good for history, anyway.
---
Easier to just listen to the [complete final boss music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkUMvj3s4RM) and skip to the best parts.
---
then you didnt yet unlock the skin as medium weight.
---
I just double checked and its medium.  
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Medium_Houndskin_Mantle 
---
FYI i used pvp to get it
---
Glad to host yea. In GW 2 raiding, having 'decent' dps really helps encounters go smoothly, but when we say decent we are talking 50% average of all players using the same build. That assuming you get normal levels of support to enhance your damage, and not doing any special fight mechanics.
---
All that takes is having the appropriate stats / runes / weapons / sigils  for your build and practicing a basic damage rotation. Ascended gear helps but isnt required to do well.
---
Its a lot less pressure than other raiding mmos in which you have to hit 'perfect' dps rotations to clear the content. 
---
Getting back into GW2 and was thinking of trying Ele out since I never really did before.  Is there any tips for leveling and/or end game? I know the typical power over everything for leveling.  Mostly looking for what is skills/weapons are best for leveling. Such like that
---
The core game used to be the only thing that existed and cost $60 (which i payed). So its totally worth the time to play, its quality isnt made with the intent of it being free so its actually a really good deal
---
Have you tried either Expansion yet? The mounts in GW2 are arguably more satisfying to unlock as each has special powers for getting around!
---
Coming from GW2 to WoW I can say, too bad Anet has adopted a "fashion is end game" mentality. I can understand long time WoW players being frustrated with BfA but I can honestly say that Blizzard may have taken a few notes from Anet on how to milk the cash cow. I mean, Anet has delayed the latest Living Story (their "free" content) so people would play Beetle Races. They push the gem shop to finance the "free content" but they only managed to release 4 this year. 1 hour of story with barely any progression gated by artificial difficulty and collections and then you have to wait 3 to 4 months for the next drip of story. 
---
As I said, I can understand the frustration of long time WoW players but take it from a long time GW2 player, the grass isn't greener in Tyria.
---
Since you mentioned not buying keys. Can anyone confirm that keys “still drop” from mobs? Iirc they said they still do but I don’t think anyone has seen one in 3 years.

Are you on NA?  If so, and you still need a guild, you can PM me your character names and I can get you some invites for a max leveled guild late tonight.
---
Well you always need a banner slave, you don't always need an ele or SB.
---
IMO, I find Warrior more fun than DH, and Warrior is considered meta for everything in PvE. Warrior is a good class to keep around because of how easy it is, and because it's always required. It's a good class to learn content on, and no one will be disappointed that a Warrior just joined (unless there's already one).
---
Coming from regular RPGs to GW2 is like seeing Mario 64 for the first time in 3D after you spent your whole childhood playing the original.
---
The moment I could press WASD mid-sword swing I literally gasped. I still remember that actually lol. I still don't think any MMORPGs today comes close to GW2 in terms of animation and overall polish.
---
“Stop laughing, I am evil !”
---
Try unlocking the Berserker specialization instead. Warrior is fun for a lot of people, but a lot of people find non-Berserker warrior extremely boring too.
---
Also, if you like Deadeye, try unlocking Daredevil on Thief. Most fun profession by far.
---
Ahahah, yup
---
This game got so much more enjoyable when I stopped trying to give a fuck about being *most efficient* with worthless virtual currency.
---
&gt;Well, it's not an _indefinite_ gear grind. Once you get ascendeds for everything you play, you're done.
---
But then begins the greatest grind of all: the fashion wars.
---
In Legion we had an artifact weapon that had a lot of traits you filled out over time. Those traits added some interesting things to a class. New abilities, nice changes to existing abilities, etc. Your tier set bonuses were usually a significant change to your class. For Legion we got an extra row of talents to pick from. Then in BFA, the artifact weapon went away, tier sets went away, there was no new tier of talents, they pruned classes again, they put abilities on the global cooldown, etc. All this replaced with a very unimpressive, unexciting new system of a necklace that unlocked abilities on 3 armor pieces that you wore. All of those abilities were extremely minor and unimpressive unlike the artifact weapon. Except for maybe on per class that was good enough to at least try for. But because it was all RNG and most abilities were stupid, a 20 ilevel upgrade to a piece of armor was often not good enough to actually use over the piece you managed to get with the one and only useful trait. 
---
If you’re really Interested in getting her used to the game without using to much skill in movement. Try getting a gaming mouse the Logitech G600 has enough buttons for all your skills, also a Razer Naga would be a good choice. It’s a good option, I convinced my girlfriend to get to play with me and she hasn’t gone back, she even mapped all her shortcuts to mine because it was just easier to play that way.
---
Agreed, though I seem to have a reverse opinion to what I usually see on this reddit. Granted I've only just finished LS3 and started PoF's story, but I remember how people here usually hate the core game's story, but really like LS3 and later...
---
On the other hand I remember I really enjoyed the core game's story, LS2 and HoT were really good too, but honestly I didn't really like LS3's story. It just seemed so haphazard, running back and forth across the continent, barely spending any time in each place; it really felt like the story only existed to somehow connect the new maps together. Then that whole plotline about the Eye of Janthir just felt so shoehorned in to someone who hasn't played GW1, and then the player blindly swearing fealty to Kryta was the really messed up cherry on top of the below-mediocre cake. (Especially for non-human races!) All in all, it was a mess compared to previous story arcs, and I hope PoF does a way better job. (So far it seems promising.)
---
Feel free to DM me so we can play together! I'm already level 15
---
I think they do, but the last time I got a key from a mob was probably months ago.
---
ahh ok, then back to https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Houndskin_Mantle_Box 
---
&gt;Unlocking a skin for one armor class unlocks it for the others.
---
I like how all the comments are ppl guessing what chronos do best
---
Join multi purpose guilds that raid and join their raids. Alternatively there's the training communities with thousands of members.
---
Some training communities might limit your progression until you meet some progression thresholds (amount of boss kills, LI, logged wing clears etc) so it might take a while before you can start doing the underworld, which is one of the harder wings.
---
Fair point 😂
---
At the end of the day, gw2 gold is worthless. Can't pay taxes in it, can't buy food with it, can't even burn to warm myself up. No point wasting life on making virtual currency when you may as well use this time to make money IRL.
---
(but I can already hear the "mah account value" butthurt when gw3 gets announced)
---
i'm starting to work towards Divinity.  aside from that, i'd say my favorites are probably the Torch, and Ipos, and likely Eureka.
---
Tecnically speaking, every profession have a role; in purely PvE perspective, having a Chrono, a Druid, or a Warrior, means you always have a spot in a meta-composition party, and even Dragonhunter, Weaver, Renegade and Deadeye are wonderful DPS. Necros and Engineer are often underestimated in the metagame (support scourge make your party unable to die \^ \^) and are quite powerful in PvP and WvW.  
---
You also may want to keep those character, even if you're not using them, to farm gathering nodes, since those can be gathered more than once using different characters (Elder wood in malchor leap, permanent Rich Iron Veins in various maps, Flax in HoT, Winterberries in Bitterfrost Frontier, just to name a few)
---
My soundly advice is to use in-game golds or real money to acquire gems and buy extra character slot.  
---
I mean... yeah... but not anymore :'(
---
for the most part. depends how far along you are on the draconis mons backpack. or does it not need the fully upgraded version?

Spolier tag, man. SPOILER TAG. Some of us didn't finish PoF yet.
---
I play full crusader (major attack and toughness, minor healing power and ferocity)  gear on my guardian (I switch between the elite specs), and it's got enough power and toughness to keep me alive during most of my solo PVE playtime.  When I'm with groups, the healing power comes in handy to keep teammates relatively healthy, especially if I'm running with mace and focus or a staff (even more so when I'm specced to have bonuses on symbols, which I love doing).  Popping swiftness with the elite skill and firebrand boons helps teammates a lot too.
---
All in all, I like being a supportive player.  Guardian has so many options on what kind of support you want to play as well, ie: great-sword for attack and retribution bonuses, hammer for toughness and protection bonuses, mace for healing, etc.  
---
As for appropriateness or competitive, I don't think any player minds having additional boons, though you can never really expect gratitude, but you want get chewed by players for NOT healing either (unless you're running raids with people who expect perfection...)  I don't really play much PVP or WVW, but I'd expect support not to be a great build for those, especially PVP.  
---
as someone who enjoyed both games, I think gw2s only flaw is the progression involving gear... exotic &gt; ascended isnt that big of a jump and legendary gear/weapons are borderline pointless minus the fashion. 
---
I realize this will sound hyperbolic and well, it is.
---
The thing is we are in my opinion witnessing the beginning of the end for blizzard. They as a company are taking the EA route thanks to activision and changes in the company. Sales and marketing departments are now reigning supreme at the company and that's never a good thing for long term health of a company.
---
You can check out some youtube videos on this topic or read some of the articles related to it online. Blizzard as a company is no longer in the business of innovation and quality products. It's now 100% about milking the consumer for as much money as possible. This has been a long time coming but now I think we've finally arrived. 
---
I mean let's just look at recent events. BFA completely and utterly fails. Blizzcon and Diablo fiasco. Heroes of the storm abandoned. Esports abandoned. SC2 maintenance mode at best but effectively abandoned. Overwatch is still going but it's a shell of their original planned game and subsists on loot boxes. Hearthstone doesn't make as much money as it once did and the community is starting to turn to alternatives. Diablo 4 is a mystery but based on a few sources has had a chaotic development cycle and at this point likely will never see the light of day or if it does it will be gutted like overwatch was from the original plan.
---
Do I think blizzard is just going to go away over night? Of course not but I do think the company we grew up with is long dead and gone. Greed has killed it and from here on out you'll see more and more loyal customers turn to alternatives.
---
Has it? In terms of notable necromancers I can only think of Marjory and Trahearne, and enemy-wise I think it's been humans too? What Asura necromancers have I missed?
---
Astralaria. Everything else sucks.
---
This question comes up regularly and my answer is always the same: *hell yes*. Played with a free account on and off for a little over 2 years and despite the restrictions I had so much to do and so much world to get lost in I kept coming back to the game and finding new things without even buying the xpacks. And when I did get them the world suddenly tripled in size and complexity and boy I'm glad I had a good handle on the base game by then or I would have been lost in the vast sea of content that gw2 has to offer.
---
Chromosomancer
---
Oh right. With all the stuff you have to redo, it could even take a week if you start with episode mastery.
---
This picture has more chrono balance than the entire game in 6 years
---
The biggest suggestion I can give is to not tell anyone you're a wow vet when you start raiding. It's very different and WoW raiders have gotten a bad rep in the raid community... At least from what I have experienced
---
Not the kind of balance update you're looking for.
---
So you moved from one colossal failure of a game to another? Sorry buddy but that isn't going to solve your problem. 
---
Wow, thank you for such a good response!
---
My main profession has been ele, so I was thinking of going ele DPS but I always thought Tempest was the best DPS, not weaver, so I'll definitely have to do some research on that. I'm also interested in Druid as ranger is my second profession and I quite like supporting - out of curiosity, is one of these - weaver and druid - easier than the other?
---
Also, you mention going to the Special Forces Training area in LA and practicing DPS if that's what I wanted to do - is there a way to practice Druid healing?
---
Thanks again!
---
Since I bought the game (2013 afaik) I quit two times for 1 year+. I play quite casual; I just run T4fractals (not cm) and recs. I don't do much more.
---
I have 1 ascended heavy armor set, 3 ascended medium armor sets, bifrost, dreamer, twilight &amp; sunrise skins (sold eternity), 4 or 5 sets of ascended trinkets, and 20+ ascended weapons. All 8 ghostly infusions and nightfury.
---
From store I have:
---
1 hat, 1 shoulder, 1 glove, 1 weapon skin, 1 bank expansion slot, 1 bank storage upgrade, 10 bag slots on my main and 8 on my alt (and 8 on another hero I deleted). I have the mistlock pass, copper fed, and spent several (5+) total makeovers and hair styles.
---
Also 3 infinite tools and how to dance v1
---
I would have more stuff but there isn't anything I really want (right now I'm working on some 2k mount skins but im not losing sleep over them since I mostly use griffon and I don't like the lion or the nightthingie)
---
I don't farm, so I'm poor. I still have pretty much everything I want. Spent $0 in gems, I just bought the game and both xpacs (hot at 10 bucks).
---
This game has given me THOUSANDS of hours of fun, the community is awesome and the t4 fractal runners are 90% great people (all the toxics are stuck in t3).
---
I would totally recommend you get the game. I love it, and you don't need to spend a single dime if you don't want to.
---
Recently joined GW2 leaving WoW and it was the first time since Mists of Pandaria where I actually ended a session of an MMO feeling satisfied. My time feels well spent and not like the game is struggling just to keep me busy. My only gripe, and it's because of my own ignorance, is how the heck do I join a guild???
---
Seems like you'd be a good person to talk to about Crossroads if you're affiliated with them then haha. So does that mean that if I were to join crossroads, I would just be able to take everything at my own pace? Say, join a raid practice run (if that's even what they're called) whenever I want or is there a registration procedure for it?
---
Thanks!
---
Thank God. I was getting tired of all the junk in my inventory. 
---
A rare picture of anet dev team balancing a chronomancer
---
It's the hardest because you need to complete the meta achievement for every LS3 map. That includes a time-gated backpiece, event chains that may or may not be populated, and lots and lots of currency farming.
---
Yep that’s the site I’ve been using, couldn’t find it though, that’s why I thought to post it here.
---
So, the leveling experience is pretty lenient to be fair, so I wouldn't worry TOO much about all this.
---
In general though, unless you decide to build your ele to be a little tankier, then playing ele close up as a new player (one who doesn't know how to dodge properly) can be kind of punishing because of the low life pool. Staff or scepter then are generally pretty strong weapons for ele to play at a distance, although personally running dagger/dagger was more fun (and transitions nicely into sword weaver if you go that path later). 
---
For traits, fire/air/arcane is a pretty standard set up for optimizing damage, starting with fire as the first trait line to pick up. Glyph of lesser elementals is a pretty good choice for leveling up solo because it can be used to take some attention away from you. Mistform, arcane shield, lightning flash are all skills that can help when you've messed up positioning and need to get out ASAP. And if you haven't gotten a character through the PoF campaign and gotten a raptor, signet of air is a welcome 25% movement speed buff to let you get around the map easily 
---
High ho! High and low!
---
Both are easy to play. Both are viable in multiple roles for endgame, with Mesmer being more versatile. Mesmer has greater outplay potential from teleports and stealth. Fun, is subjective. Ask yourself Do you prefer dancing around with pink butterflies or pretend it’s Halloween year round reanimating the dead?
---
Whats the easiest way to get minstrel trinkets apart from raids.
---
At this point, I have no intention of going back to WoW, as for what I enjoy in Guild Wars, the Lore and Exploration, I like that major characters are flawed and not safe, seriously I'm terrified Arenanet will kill off all my favourites and I love the world, WoW was very late to the whole secrets thing, there's something hidden in every map on Tyria and I just love exploring on my Sylvari Ranger, my only gripe is that transmog isn't as accessible in this, requiring transmute charges and skins are few and far between (for a f2p player) 
---
I was going to say it looks like a demonic Yoda.
---
T1 barely qualifies as entry level content, it's practically on par with the daily free gold completion. The WoW comparison would be normal dungeons or the easiest heroic dungeons.
---
If we're honestly comparing WoW gearing to GW gearing, the timeline should be to ask about T3 and T4, or optimized raid gear with POF stats. The GW2 pace on that is heavily time-gated and quite awful, and I've yet to see or hear otherwise from anyone who didn't already have access to high-end content with good drop rates, or a stockpile of gold.
---
It would be nice, but after a while you just get used to it.
---
would a i5 7400 be enough for this game specifically? I saw online it is a good combo for this GPU
---
I see. Thanks for clarifying!
---
With very few exceptions dungeons don't really require a certain gear level, proper builds, learning rotations or anything like that. It just speeds things up. You should be able to do dungeons without any of those things though.  
---
As dungeons aren't that popular, you usually need to open up a group in LFG if you want to do a run. If you aren't confident enough to do that, you might be better off starting up with T1 fractals. Should be more populated and about the same difficulty level.
---
Here you go.

These are the ones I liked best from the Wooden Potatoes thread. As already stated I have the "Vivid_lighting_Preset - V 1.2" file as my default.
---
Watch the wooden potatoes video on how to set up GW2hook - https://youtu.be/FbO-VMPxksA
---
and if you are running arcdps be aware you might need to rename the dll file.
---
Enjoy :)
---
Just by the description it sounds like the helm from the [Avenger's Armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Avenger%27s_armor) set - human T2 cultural. Your Norn wouldn't be able wear that.
---
The Winged Headpiece from the gem store is likely a good fit, honestly. Barring that, there really aren't a lot of good options imo.
---
Specifically after Midnight Pacific Monday morning. Most people use 8 scrolls after finishing the intro and then do the story. If you pick human commoner and warrior it is doable in 22 minutes with some luck with the gate. I've never beaten that time (and warrior got nerfed since then), but I came close with an ele and L20 level booster scroll - 23 1/2 minutes (killed by having to wait at the gate in the intro). Generally a competent player takes 30 - these were intentional speed runs cutting all corners possible.
---
reminds me of legend of grimrock, especially the indoors
---
Action Cam with ground target skills, still kind of annoys me.
---
Maybe wasn't obvous enought, my bad, I was referring to match an helmetless character skin with the Zodiac torso color using the Celestial Infusion effect
---
Don't you need to be lvl 80 for it though?
---
why do you care so much dude just leave it
---
Just a bit of practice:-)
---
thanks
---
ok
---
i leveled weaponsmith and armorsmith, from 0-500 on a relatively fresh character about half a year back.  ended up south of level 50.
---
I buy keys, rarely get anything to scream about, but still buy keys. The reason for this madness is because I not only like to give AN my money to keep the content coming, but to also do my part to encourage other game producers to follow a similar business model.
---
I can't say specifically, but I would imagine that it should run fine. You might have to turn down character models but that's nothing new
---
They don't match at all. The Celestial infusion is a very dark blue compared to the Zodiac effect. You can use a winter's heart infusion to tone down the celestial blue, but even then they don't match at all.   
---
Why do you care so much to try and pass as important? You clearly aren't. 
---
I was mostly meaning when looking for a static, a lot of the long time raiders I have talked to say they don't really like to bring in people that advertise themselves as wow raiders. Mostly because those people normally don't stick around for long, but also cause they tend to be stuck in their ways.
---
thanks for your opinion, I still would like to see a screen, I already supposed it didn't looked greath, but for the design I have in mind, I may find a way to make it work \^ \^
---
GOTTA GO FAST
---
One of the top posts is some dude looking for a Warframe guild. More people will probably see this here than anything I post over there.
---
I main Healer in every MMO I’ve played. Even TERA, WoW, FFXIV. I have multiple classes geared for healing/support role and I would say Druid is a mediocre healer. After the nerf to GotL, the only real benefit is ease of gameplay and uptime of boons. I really enjoy Scrapper and Warrior healer on raids and fractals. It’s easy to find groups as long as it’s not ‘CM’ or ‘elitist meta only’
---
I played with the last Tyrian Adventure and it was fun and lots of shinies were had by all!
---
look at trailer or teaser and you have information there. 
---
Truthful answer: absolutely any exotic dps build that makes sense. T1 fractals are extremely forgiving, so as long as you're running a build that makes sense, even without having any idea of how rotations work, then you'll be perfectly fine.
---
More helpful answer: [power deadeye](https://discretize.eu/builds/thief/power-deadeye) is extremely simple but gives high single target DPS, and pretty much rotates around backstabbing and auto attacking. Another option is [power dragonhunter](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter), which has I think one of the shortest rotations out there right now 
---
Wow I'm going to do this for my next character!
---
Scythe looks too short, its not 30 times their body length   
---
That said, looks great. 
---
No fam I was talking about both. My bad if I didn't make it clear. Ascended is required for fractals because infusion slots and I thought that was obvious enough. 
---
i never said that but ok buddy :smiley-face:
---
:)
---
Is it rude if I send silver to random people that I don't know in newbie areas? Kind of feel like im throwing money af them like a rich snob even though ik trying to help. Oh yeah and whats up with the few players in the open world acting like Npcs? Its really weird
---
Ouch 
---
Yeah, it's strange. They'd rather spend the entire day explaining to you how you're wrong and than let you play the damn game your way. I never met that specific kind of intolerance and it really creeps me out.
---
The funniest thing is, you got different difficulties everywhere else in the game. Dungeons have easier story paths followed by significantly harder explorable modes. PvP has like four different kinds of modes PLUS a ranking system, Fractals have a hundred fucking levels in four different tiers of difficulty. Core Tyria is much easier than HoT.
---
But raids?
---
I genuinely have no other explanation than insanity.
---
But Pack Runes don't have permanent uptime on their Might. Even with 100% boon duration, you get the 10 stacks if Might for 16 seconds every 30 seconds. 
---
But now that I think about it Renegade should be able to cover 20 Might by themselves if they use F1 on cooldown (with 100% boon duration. Which leaves 5 stacks of Might for Mantra of Potence.
---
So yeah, I agree that Pack Runes will be a good choice for both builds. It may be possible for heal Renegade to slot some other rune and FB to give perma Fury without too much of a dps loss, but I am not sure.
---
They're progressively reducing the amount ofinventory management you have to do, so its good.
---
4000 plus subs, 4 upvotes. I would say your chances are pretty good, have at it! Or if not, just scroll through, guilds do adverts there too
---
I so wanted to craft this instead of Frostfang, but I still need 3 lousy central Tyria mastery points to close out that line (and all central Tyria lines).
---
I really just need to shamelessly beg people to run me through a few fractals to pick up easy ones there, like the chickens, bowing in cliffside, and one other that I don't have yet, but as a largely solo player it's tough.
---
I likened it to Metroid games where I would happen upon the MPs and go "ah, need another mount for that". But that's exactly the approach to have for it. :)
---
Gotcha, that makes a lot of sense. I'm probably going to go through and actually look at all the Necro art for that stuff now.
---
I tend to name each build with wut weapon set using and the stances on the title
---
Pretty damn awesome :D
---
By that logic, 99% of all reddit comments on this subreddit should get deleted.

I'm on EU, I'd like to join you. I'm also seeking for friends to do some daily PvP for the sweet 2 pieces of gold or anything else. Anyone who's reading also looking for friends, you can also add me. My for now main character has the same name as my user here. 
---
This actually answers the question I was asking; thank you. Sadly, when I first stopped playing this was the turn the communities were taking, but I guess I was hoping there may have been a change. Because of this I started spending more time is spvp. Hopefully the changes come sooner than we expect.
---
keep your old class dont delete anything. 
---
Its been 5 years, start a new class from the beginning (its not like it takes long to get to max level) and treat it like a new game.
---
Hammer is better overall, but greatsword is a viable alternative.
---
for ppl who started on day1 was a lot easier buy gemstore service that are needed like extra back slot , material storage, savage o matic... for new platers... well it's still worth , but the gemstore conversion is crazy right now compared to 6-5 years ago
---
My best advice would be to start a new character so you get used to the "things that are in front of you". Understand small menus, what each little thing etc.
---
Then after that if you want to keep PoF you can but I'd say do everything in order they were released.
---
I should have been more clear. The story is pretty good, especially season 4. The jaw dropping point should be clarified to mean "the story and how it is told compared to other MMOs" I've played many mmos probably like many of the people who play guild wars. A fully voice acted story with free updates every like 3+ months (as long as you log in at those release times).
---
Great initiative!
---
Yup. 
---
The expansions are pretty awesome, but otherwise playing it free is good. It's a great game with a great business model.
---
Yeah they'd be better off learning how to play on mouse/keyboard but I know how hard it can be to get women who never played vidya into vidya, so I don't blame OP for looking for easier ways. If anything I recommend getting them a mouse with 12 buttons on the side, makes playing much easier for me since I just bind all of my abilities to it (except f1-5 which I just put on 1-5 keys).
---
&gt; and good luck farming trinkets in fractals when you can only do Tier 1: Four pristine relics per day, when you need 100 just for one accessory, that's ridiculous.
---
If the only purpose for getting ascended trinkets is agony resistance then the way I did it was to buy a ring from the crest vendor in sw and another with a fractal currency that I happened to have from clearing a couple dailies( there's no way they are as expensive as you say). Also an amulet with laurels but that's irrelevant. With those you can probably do up to 30-35( depending on how many +1 agony resistance infusions you have farmed at that point). Right now my biggest roadblock to getting ascended weapons is mithrilium, elonian leather and the plank( all time gated). It's just stupid, basically the game locks you to t1 and no leggy progression for the first month( plus you need 3 professions as artificer+weaponsmith can't do the leather).
---
Best place to do this is the shiverpeaks. Tons of yellow mobs grouped together like dolyaks, moas, deer/stag/etc

Taking titles away? What titles did Blizzard remove?
---
Congrats! Jackal is my main mount, I love my sand doggo.
---
My memory of Tera was amazing combat, boring everything else. I didn't play it long, as I was hoping for better story. The Secret World was the opposite - interesting story and puzzles, absolutely terrible combat (unless you love WoW - pretty much cloned from that). Never was a fan of fighting mob after mob anyway, which is why I left GW2 for a while. Gliders and mounts made a world of difference for avoiding boring, repetitive encounters I've already done a dozen or more times.
---
Yeah I did that, and now I'm suffering Alt-itis. Trying to find what class/race/personal story options I enjoy the most.
---
Maybe they cannot handle the truth lol.
---
Oh lord. What am I missing already 0.0
---
the other 3 skritt carry your gathering tool skins
---
looking to give the game another try after quitting really early in it. I have the base retail copy, is that enough to get started? I'm used to only trinity mmo's , what's good advice to getting into the gw2 system? any suggested classes for somebody that has no idea what to play?
---
Sequitur tenebris, aeternum ira! 
---
Those lyrics are so epic, I remember every line. :) 
---
Low-level Fractals are a great place to start. They're not too long, not too hard, and you can go in one at a time.
---
Fractals were designed to be a great endless-difficulty-progression system, but they start out very simple. You don't even need Agony Resistance for the first multiple levels (meaning you don't need ascended gear of any kind either).
---
Use LFG and give them a try! I think you'll find what you're looking for there.
---
Growing hair with a hat?
---
Holy moley the staring at the ground. I asked her if she wanted me to explain her weapon skill 2, and she just said, "No, I'm fine."
---
It's nice to hear from someone in the same scenario!
---
GW2 and WoW are so different that I'd argue they cater to different interests. I don't see GW2 as what WoW could be, I see GW2 as its own thing entirely and not something WoW should want to become or will ever become. I enjoyed both but for entirely different reasons.
---
Gah, I wish I'd read the fineprint on that thing. Thought it was basically an infinite bl kit with lower rare material salvage. Ah well live and learn I guess.

GW2 was my first MMORPG (started right before HoT release).  It introduced me to a genre that I had always shied away from for various reasons.  I left after putting in a couple hundred hours, but always felt that draw back to the *genre*.  I've tried pretty much every single one available since then, including a huge amount in WoW (much easier to stay tied to a game when all your friends are playing).  I've even gone back and tried the ones that started it all if they were available.  I can say, without a shred of doubt, that GW2 is the best one on the market at what it does.  Hands down.
---
The other MMO's out there made me a healer.  Does it kinda bother me that I can't be a full on healer in GW?  Sure.  But the sum of all the other parts is much greater than what any other MMO with true healer builds can offer.  I think I can get over the fact that I may have to target enemies when I play.
---
And it's true that I care, I've had my attention on the news for weeks about Blizzard-Activision, Bethesda, EA, all the AAA company blunders recently. I'm completely thankful that ArenaNet hasn't been that stupid, or forced to be. Every Publisher/Developer needs income and ArenaNet gets that in a fair way that isn't trying to hurt their community.
---
It sucks, that's all. It's sad to see dedicated WoW Players forced to quit a game they loved for years because of fat-greedy-"invester"-fingers... So I think GW2 is a place to feel some Developer love in this dark time.
---
"There is tons of content". If youre not interested in T4s + CMs and raids there is nothing else to do. You can always do HoT metas and grind istan till you drop.
---
I would agree that it has its purposes.  I think it also helps more casual players see more content.
---
There were lots of guilds on my BG that couldn’t full clear a raid, but they could do like half.  So when new tiers came out, and they could at least get some of the new gear, it let them go back and finish the previous tier.  See/beat the last boss, finish quests, get the last few pieces of their armor skins, etc...
---
I feel like retiring content isn’t the best tho...  While I admit full clearing 8 wings will be a chore to do (especially at reset), it’s not like you HAVE to do every wing, but like, it lets people who want more content have access to the farm if they want it.

Tee-hee six

Good call on the action cam.  Getting used to WASD, jumping, and dodging is the basics to movement of course.  If she's not comfortable with that then adding in all the skills will be challenging.  
---
Think of changing her keybinds.  Having dodge on the mouse thumb is very intuitive.  You can wasd dodge in any direction without taking your fingers off wasd.  Middle mouse to switch action cam on/off so she can click around on the interface if she wants to access the ui instead of remembering hotkeys.  Second middle mouse for interact I find comfortable as well.  
---
It's just a lot of muscle memory so I'd spend 10 minutes at first just doing movement, strafing, dodging in every direction, jumping to warm up and then probably hit up an easier jumping puzzle.  Move on to some mobs, but have her only use auto attack (left mouse click) while trying to move around a mob and time her dodges with mob attacks or aoe, etc.  When she sees "evaded" she knows she dodged!  Good luck, have fun.  
---
Just left WoW and started GW2 last week. So far I’m loving most of the professions I’ve tried and having a hard time deciding what to play. The hardest transition so far has been going from relatively easy open world fights to getting one-shotted by Champions. Can’t recall anything in WoW that could stomp me into the dirt the way a single hit from one of these guys can!
---
Most comments aren't useless to the extent of "Hmmmm... XD" though.
---
Pm me your character name afaik guilds and lfg are cross-server
---
In a word, yes.
---
You can play the game at the free level very well for a very long time. The base world is very big so you will have a lot to do and explore before you ever need to buy the expansion.
---
However, you will need to buy the expansion some day in order to access the whole world. In that sense the game is still, strictly speaking a buy to play game rather than truly a free to play game. There is a significant amount of content that you simply cannot access will out using real money to buy the game.
---
But once you have bought the game you can get to everything in the game eventually without spending anymore, at least until they have another expansion.  The living world seasons that you missed do need to be bought but you can buy them in game with gems earned from selling gold on the exchange.  Basically, everything in the game beyond the box itself can be earned. For this reason I think it is the most reasonable cash shop supported game on the market.
---
So while I think you really should plan to buy the game eventually and that it is well worth it, in the mean time the game will still be great give you enough to work on while you save for or simply decide if you want to spend on the box.
---
HOPE and Nevermore.
---
Astralaria is pretty cool too, but i'm trying to convince myself that it's not because i already had frostfang before HoT and i don't need to swap stats or other ascended\legendary weapons of this type.
---
It does: pocket raptors.
---
Exactly - and I read that difference as part of OP's question. It's far simpler, to the point where I'd almost call everything past the first four "Gen 2.5" since the system is so much more trimmed down.
---
I've seen a few people in my various guilds get bored while making one of the newest ones, but no one quite gets *frustrated* the way folks making HOPE, Astralaria, or (slightly different prospect) Aurora have.
---
If I could have avoided all of Chuka's damn jumping puzzles in favor of Istan grind, I definitely would have. Though, I'm still proudest of having done it, out of all the legendaries I have.
---
Let's hold onto the brim of our pants and fly, just to hope . . . something good comes out of this.
---
Well crash team racing is getting remade this year!
---
If you have access to the mounts, running through central tyria open world collecting PoIs, events and waypoints n stuff would probably help out. Will also give you a leg up when you get to LVL 80 and want to do world completion for a legendary.
---
NICE TRY ANET
---
&gt;for the love of the Six.
---
Oh boy.
---
Eh, he was just elaborating. I didn't really put much detail in my initial reply.
---
I think there is hope for an easy raid mode though, this thread was super active even though people had to go to the new tab to even see it, so anet must have picked up on something like this too.
---
Animation and feel for sure. I've dipped into FFXIV twice with friends, and while it's fun, I hate hate hate how I feel tied down for everything all the time. It feels so clunky. I got why we had to do that with online stuff years and years ago, but nowadays it just feels bad. 
---
Pretty uninspiring if we’re being honest. 
---
condi is totally fine while leveling.  most of the condi skills have enough direct damage to handle mobs at lower than 80, and Magi's is temple armor (might also be Named, but i can't remember those option off the top of my head) so its (relatively) easy to get geared in exotics once you hit 80 and have access to Orr.
---
Deadeye has quite possibly the easiest [raid build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Deadeye_-_Power_DPS_D/D) ever with dual daggers. At one time this topped DPS charts, and not because Shadow Flare was bugged.
---
Also the [P/P Unload](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Deadeye_-_P/P_Unload) build is hilariously fun in open world content, although it's not  as effective in raids/fractals
---
I can't stand double button pressing and avoid it for everything but targetting.
---
I'd suggest helping her set one up to her comfort. Adjusting layout a few times til you find the right fit.
---
I use alt, shift and ctrl . for example on xbox 360 joypad.
---
My shoulder buttons were alt and shift. 
---
My attack skills
---
1=X
---
2=Y
---
3=B
---
4=Left Trigger
---
5=right trigger.
---
A was jump (but id actually suggest A to be skill 4 and left trigger as jump or dodge, to use while moving camera)
---
To get F skills I used alt+12345 and to use the utilities, I used shift +12345.
---
I find this easier than remebering double presses.
---
My dodge was the start button.)
---
Movement is left thumb stick
---
camera(that is mouse) right thumb stick.(use action cam)
---
Thumb stick buttons = mouse clicks. 
---
back button = whatever it is that enters and leaves action cam.
---
The d pad was Next Target, F(Pick up loot), turn off and on auto lock ground target. ..and Tab
---
(ctrl+12345 for mounts)
---
Id suggest adding double taps for lock target etc.
---
(oh, this is from memory as I now use an xbox elite controller, I love this game with controller).
---
I like you.
---
&gt; I hope PoF does a way better job.
---
PoF is solid.  The LS aftermath is weird.  Parts of it are _glorious_, but the overall theme is kind of freaking lame, especially considering the base story.   Then again, any joker of a midboss is going to be a mere joke after elder dragons and PoF.
---
It's not that though. The gold grind is present regardless. The reason the collection based Legendaries are so much more difficult is because you have to complete the lengthy, tedious, time-gated collection ON TOP of accumulating the gold.
---
&gt; Just don't mention Scarlet to any players who played during the living story season 1. ;)
---
Hsssss! 
---
I kid, I kid. :3  
---
Possibly unpopular opinion, but initially, I liked her. Sassy plant-Joker personality. Buuut, she got way too Mary Sue and then Taimi constantly rubbing it in during Season 2 didn't make me like Scarlet any better. 
---
This isn't always the case. I've always had difficulty with kb + m. Health pushed me into controller play and I'm actually thankful,  it's much better..for me.
---
i dont. but i do other stuff if he is interested
---
This also makes it so much easier to just take a break when you're feeling burned out or just generally a bit bored. You aren't pressured to log in to complete hours of dailies/weeklies/monthlies for stat increases or risk falling behind the crowd. If you leave and come back you're still in the same relative position as you were before.
---
If she uses xbox one controllers on win 10, she can get a chatpad, mostly negating the need for a keyboard.
---
Ehh not a huge fan of that skin. I like the primeval one. Jackal has been out of my favor though, dreadnaught raptor. Mmm thats some good shit its huge on charr.
---
Unfortunately i tried this twice but it didn't work, so i gave up on it, it works for a little bit but after a day or two it is back to it's broken state. it is alot of effort to keep putting the builds and stuff in.  So here is still hoping that Anet gets their own version of it.
---
One thing that's really fun about the jackal is that when it teleports, it goes in the direction your camera is facing rather than in the direction the jackal was facing or moving. 
---
So if you pan the camera around 90 or 180 degrees as you're moving you'll teleport in that direction and come out of the teleport facing and moving in that direction.
---
This can be useful on some jumping obstacles. 
---
these are always ridiculously fun and just swimming in prizes. You want to play along  :D
---
we welcome all the refugees from WoW :)
---
Istan is probably not a bad choice. Most people do it for loot but there's tons of stuff dying so I'd imagine there's tons of exp to be gained at the same time. Idk cause my pof masteries are complete except the roller beetle that I haven't bothered to unlock yet. 
---
This is what I always do, since I'm always using mystics anyway, I just make my next one whenever it shows up as a daily.
---
Why are there so many sales in March?
---
Have you tried flipping through a [generator](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=KYQuXNjZD4uv5wKN3r6oDg&amp;q=sylvari+name+generator&amp;btnK=Google+Search&amp;oq=sylvari+name+generator&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0j0i22i30.109.2591..2644...0.0..0.255.3208.4j12j4......0....1..gws-wiz.....0..0i131j0i22i10i30.Gne-d8BAmNo) or [two](https://www.google.com/search?ei=ToQuXNOCMrCe_Qalw6DABA&amp;q=elf+name+generator&amp;oq=elf+name+generator&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i7i30l10.572.770..851...0.0..0.133.224.1j1......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71.M_Nk9VB9pQw)?
---
SH-SH-SHHAAA!
---
Obligatory complaint re: backpacks with Harrier stats that don't come from collections.  It's a gap that has yet to be filled.
---
Otherwise... HoT stats have LWS3, PoF stats have a few options for *some* pieces, you can get Berserker trinkets via a variety of methods... they're all *technically* some sort of grind but odds are good that one or two of the available methods will be something the player enjoys.
---
If it makes any difference, I've been enjoying casual WvW lately. They made a really important change in that participation (i.e. how you earn progress on your reward tracks) does not decay when you are not in WvW. So it's now really easy to log in and roam or join a zerg and get full credit instead of doing things for an hour getting nothing and then having to leave when you finally hit 195+.
---
it's manageable with vpn  if u rather have good quality game play
---
rigged.
---
I have looked through a few. Just really like the name since its Irish for freedom
---
No, you just have to have all of LS3.
---
No, [Aurora](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Aurora) needs season 3 and open world.
---
I've been playing since Beta and I just don't know what to do. I like cosmetics and transmog but can't find anything interesting that isn't super high end. The content I end up enjoying doesn't reward anything (zerg battles and massive champ trains).
---
No it does not.
---
I feel like they fix that every 3-6 months so unlikely.
---
I can't,  I have win 7, it doesn't work :(
---
Id love too tho. 
---
Wish has some cheap chatpads, (go for the hard button ones), that might be worth trying.
---
Ironically, I'd argue you're underthinking it.
---
While yes, Bay of Sirens is indeed the old name for Sea of Sorrows, that doesn't mean Siren's Reef is a pre-Cataclysm place. See: Siren's Landing. There are other references to sirens too, and Sea of Sorrows novel mentions mermaids (aka sirens).
---
Besides, Sparkfly and the Tarnished Coast have very similar aesthetics, in both games.
---
Ultimately, I don't think we'll ever be told where or when this Siren's Reef takes place, as we never found out where or when Deepstone Fractal took place. We could only generalize on a few clues (that was post-Transformation of the Dwarves, and somewhere in cold climate thus likely Shiverpeaks, which is a very, very, veery wide range). We'll likely only find out that it's "before/after such and such" and "is the coast of this major body of water".
---
Thanks!  I've just got to do the Kourna meta and I'll have roller beetle unlocked.  :)
---
I have actually tried that when I thought about rerolling my Blue Sylvari to a human. In the end, i decided not to because it bugged me that you still see your normal skin color on the character select and hero panel
---

Hope this helps

Oh this is really good dude!!!
---
DLGamer is another place you can get GW2 expansions from, usually at a good price. They've been an ANet partner for a long time, so it's totally legit.
---
Ron
---
Don't forget Afflicted for the truly awful "adds are way more dangerous that the boss" trifecta of Afflicted, Toxic Trails, and Last Laugh. Also known as "stacking is literally fucking impossible, I'm not playing chrono here".
---
You know it won't 😥
---
Yeeeaa, stuff like new player experience and begginer missions for could use a bit of dust sweeping. Adding the big bosses a big, "red circle" attack and a Dodge mechanic pop-up could be a start. Also break-bar and environmental weapons that do break bar damage.
---
Sadly that kind of gameplay never interested me. I enjoyed the community aspect of working with multiple guilds on a server, pulling resources, and defeating an enemy. I got my reward type stuff from farming gold for legendaries and fractals for ascended gear.
---
yeah like game demos, end game contents for MMOs are everything, also power creep is stronger with every expansion, so they can sell their expansion even if the content is dog shit.
---
I am sure this has been said before in a similar way:  
---
You can play the free game, get a feel for it, see if you like the gameplay and all - no problem.  
---
If you end up kinda-liking, or not hating it - go buy  the expacs, they are incredibly good. The Story, the PVE, the PVP experience with the elite specs, it all gets so much better with the Expansions
---
[Apple Cider]
---
Ahh, that hit the spot.
---
Gw1 coastal areas in kryta were amazing compared to gw2 kryta coastal areas. 
---
Gw2 did the shiverpeaks better
---
I just hope it doesnt have long walking parts like deepstone or at least it has some interesting skips. 
---
Hey. I started playing like you during Christmas.
---
Wow sucked so after playing rogue for 12 years I am thief with a bloody sniper rifle! How awesome is that.
---
Plus the mounts feel so fresh.
---
I leveled from 1 to 80 and enjoying currently path of fire story. 
---
After that I have no clue what to do, but coz there is so many things to do! Still haven't tried pvp, dungeons WvW, conquest, raids... I heard there are legendaries....
---
Love how fresh it feels.
---
If you are interested, hit me up in PM so we can explore together.
---
You did a good choice coming to GW! 
---
Not the OP, but I'm interested in advice for this. 
---
I played Hunter (survival after the change to melee it had a ton of mobility to dance in and out of combat with ranged and melee attacks as well as beastmaster) It was refreshing game play.
---
I mained a holy paladin for a long time as well, but I always wished for a true shockadin/ Warrior Priest play style from Warhammer Online.
---
I have dabbled with the engi and guardian in GW2, but I didn't get above level 10 or so before getting bored. I think I need to log into the PVP lobby to test out both the above professions and probably the ranger at full loadout.
---
I enjoy zergs in both 
---
it would be if it only had build templates
---
These are fantastic! I love Ihri's!
---
If you mean generic meta stats for endgame pve the meta constantly shifts. Viper, zerker, are constant dps stats.
---
The meta for tanks/healers/sup/etc might shift due to changes to mainly boons/traits so a few good things you COULD keep around are~ harrier, minstrels, rampager, trailblazer, nomads, maybe givers. Chronotanks have shifted stat wise from minstrels too nomad i believe due to the mes changes. Honestly if ur playing a healer regardless of what ppl say as long as u take a stat combo with healing &amp; concentration your good. 
---
So if we tie the two of you together and throw you both into the Mystic Forge with a vial of blood and some Elonian Wine, we'll get..
---
...a Revenant with Requiem in pink and Eternity in its inventory saying "This weapon cannot be used by your class."
---
What bothers me about it is that you can only use it on heavy classes. More classes need mace!
---
Well look, all I can say is that I'm sorry that if a comment that harmless gets you this frustrated and angry. Of all comments that could be made, I honestly don't see any ill will that was being put worth with the comment, and it saddens me greatly to think that a comment that innocent might evoke such strong, negative emotions out of you and other people.
---
Have a good evening.
---
That being said, guardian hammer always feels like it packs a heft.
---
Hopefully, new instabilities won’t have oppressive combos like this. We’ll have to see!
---
And then you played vanilla ranger sword and you felt like you were playing a different mmo again T.T
---
What a stupid question.
---
Phantasm + Axe 2ing through the ole hitbox while shatterspaming and jaunting back to where you started for an instant 3 clone refill.  Classic good times.
---
Even before the Midnight and total raid boons nerf, don’t even know how people still wanted play chaos when illusions is so fun.  
---
Precisely what I was talking about. The QoL of having infinite uses is the only way Silver-fed is better than Mystic. The Runecrafter kit has done nothing to change the balance between the two kits.
---
Exactly. This looks like it could have been shot in any basic sparkly fly area... not much looks new, most of looks like already available assets. How about teasing the bosses. Is there a new infusion? Or cm? Tease that. This is boring. 
---
I wish I was that wall
---
yeah, mainly rings, sometimes accessories. thanks for the list!
---
Oola
---
Nightmare material. Its almost terrifying as that Trump char someone posted.
---
I can’t even tell the difference between this sub and /r/wow with how much wow bashing is going on 
---
Yeah, I have the stones to make them, but why bother when I can spend a little copper and never worry? From a profit stand point it's ridiculous, but now I'm not running around trying to get more stones lol. I'm agreeing with you. 
---
I'd disagree that MHW has limited replayability, considering that it has plenty to grind for at endgame and a very high skill ceiling, on top of content updates and a large upcoming expansion.
---
Suuper cool! Amazing idea.
---
Bloodstone trinkets, and Mist trinkets from WvW can both be stat-swapped.
---
It wasn't a bad year, but it wasn't amazing either.  There wasn't really a whole lot of instanced PvE to do.  If I didn't go for the Fractal CMs or Fractal God I probably would have quit.  The lack of new CMs is really disappointing and unsatisfactory. 
---
I can understand if you play lots of open world and want to celebrate the maps, but I feel like each release had problems people are glossing over. 
---
I'd love another CM, please. Preferably one that isn't just boss fights.
---
All or just core?
---
Oh yeah forgot about the bloodstone and mist ones being able to change. Thanks you for correcting me!
---
i can hang you on it and pretend you are the wall if you'd like that
---
Yeah fair enough. Whenever a new mmorpg comes out it’s always referred to as “the WoW killer” I think because WoW currently is known as the most successful/popular mmorpg? I don’t know.. 
---
You mean like the WoW/FFXIV dungeon finder?
---
I am sorry are you mixing me up with anyone? I simply showed the good part for the topic starter where you can make any group you want which was leading from the very top to the very bottom with a broad range and out of no were you tell me i need to do tier 1 fractals. I mean ok ty for the advice but i done fractals since they came out and done tier 4 fractals since they also became a thing. And i make the groups i wish for or join those that suits me and dont have issues with that. So again what is your issue really?
---
I tend to keep all the ascended gear I get, either as drops or through gathering (LWS3 maps currency). You never know if an obscure stat becomes meta.
---
Draw me like one of your french girls
---
No i am trying to figure out what your point is but tbh i don't care anymore so what ever :)
---
I used to think the same thing, but that didn't work as soon as I wanted to play a different role/playstyle. I need a support/boon set for my chronomancer, a zerk set for my weaver, and a viper set for my scourge. Sure, you don't have to play different roles, but if you want to change playstyle from time to time and still play it in high-level content, you need more than 3 sets of gear. Depends on how you like to play the game though.
---
I did not know there was a dispute. I gave the advice i feel suited if you feel you need to add more info feel free.
---
If you want to see in ONE awesome image what have changed in the game, check this :
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7147bq/i_left_guild_wars_2_during_what_changed_a/
---
It doesn't contain what have been added in 2018 but it's a great way to understand how much the game have changed :)
---
This is why it's my main mount. Just being able to hook around tight turns is a God send.
---
Bloodstone is Core + HoT, iirc (I'm pretty sure you can't get Grieving stats on a Blood Ruby Band). 
---
Mist is all.
---
I remember reading something that they want fractals to be main 5man content and dungeons being nightmare code-wise. But it's been long ago so maybe I'm remembering this incorrectly.
---
That's a good question. Personally, I don't remember if they officially said anything. I would love to find out, because it definitely has been a while.
---
To my best understanding, though, the original dungeons just didn't offer the quality they currently expect, and even the rewards and structure just seem outdated.
---
But I feel like, if they really wanted to, they could start making in-world dungeons again, with new ones being totally rebranded from the old variety. But it seems like they generally prefer to either A) have the absolute creative freedom that Fractals offer, or B) go all-out with difficulty and mechanical intricacy in raids.
---
That said, with the latest "dungeon" content being almost a mini/diet raid for The Secret Lair of the Snowmen, i wouldn't be surprised if they were using that to test the reception of new dungeon-like content.
---
I wouldn't totally give up hope, but don't expect anything like the old dungeons. They're kind of a mess.
---
No worries, kind sir. It was a mere addition to your already fine piece of information, not so much a correction 😉
---
&gt;prior to acquiring the expansions, there are plenty of things that will be challenging to a new player in the base game
---
I can't think of anything beyond jumping puzzles and Triple Trouble that are particularly challenging in core open world. It is extremely forgiving, compared to PoF and especially to HoT. Dungeons can have some challenge to them, but they have their own problems, like being riddled with bugs and cheesy mechanics (such as 10-second fears or oneshots with awful telegraphs).
---
&gt;The base game story is perfectly functional.
---
Gotta be honest, I can't find much enjoyment in the personal story. I genuinely like the idea and what they *tried* to do, and I also enjoy that every race has its own branched storyline, but I find it boring at its best and borderline cringeworthy at its worst. The pacing is all over the place, Destiny's Edge is handled awfully, most characters are hardly memorable... I could go on all night. As someone who is very much enjoying the contemporary story, I certainly find the personal story to be a mess.
---
&gt;The core specs are perfectly fine to do core content with
---
You're right, the elite specs thing isn't really a massive deal from the perspective of a core player, at least during levelling.
---
&gt;Sort of true, except in Core GW2 there are tons of waypoints
---
I'm speaking mostly from the perspective of a new player. I have helped a bunch of people get into this game from the ground up and the one thing I hear very regularly is "damn I wish I had a springer" or "I can't keep up with this event train, everyone uses mounts", etc etc. Putting mounts in core Tyria was pretty much the best expansion marketing ArenaNet could've done for new players, because it really does make F2P players feel like they're missing out.
---
I do not have to google it because i played games were grinding is something i had to do for 24/7 for months to be able to stay on the world first top raider side. So i know what real grind is. GW2 have nothing of that. It is my personal opinion though that if you feel it is hard to get ascended gear in this game and feel that is a terrible grind then you never played a game that have a real grind, and if you have then why are you still moaning about getting ascended gear in GW2. Either way i have very little patience today and feel this is going nowere intersting, so i am done.
---
I would hardly call it strong negative emotions. His comment was bad and I didn't feel like other needed to see it so I downvoted it. I don't feel particularly strongly about it. At most I'd say the comment mildly annoyed me.
---
If I was pissed or something I might reply with a rant but since I didn't feel that strongly about it I just downvoted it. I only replied to explain the downvotes because you asked what was wrong with the comment.
---
Time for the 8th rewatch I guess.
---
I main core guard in pvp and I dislike hammer as well, it feels "clunky" although it has better cc. Greatsword provides good dps, gap closer and possibility for multi pull
---
And it is and has been since its launch. 
---
The site is good but that's why I said the best way is to go to a bank NPC and go to the wardrobe bank and look at the heavy helm armor and just click through them until you find the one you were looking for. 99% of all armor is there save I think a few raid and unreleased pieces.
---
Yeah that’s true :) thanks 
---
Would be my favorite, if not for the size. The thing is the size of the tallest human male torso.

Every thread like this is always the same - it shows that gw2 is not great by itself, byt because other games failed. Same in gaming media. Game is only relevant for them in context of failure of other companies or their products.
---
Yeah. I've only crafted Gen 1 legendaries so far (or, to be more exact, legendary), and the effort that go into a Gen 2 does seem a bit daunting by comparison.
---
We'll see though. I think I will one day just start it, as you say, and hope to get deep enough in that there are no choices but to finish it... :)
---
So much Charr art recently! :D
---
that big gate looks just like the one where you first do eye of janthir
---
Almost everything they release beside expansion stuff is made out of old assets. I'm not the biggest fan of this practice (although I get why they're doing it this way) but I think they did a pretty good job on this one. 
---
Doing dailies to get that juicy Daily completionist 2g and Shards.
---
Also building Xp Writs help immensely when levelling a new character.
---
Just save them up, dabble in dailies, do map completion at yur own pace, explore the core world.
---
Once yu get HoT there might be a slight story gap so fill yurself in with the wiki and prepare at least some Exotic gear with abit of durability in stats cos its gonna be rough.
---
Raptor, springer, and skimmer are required to advance through the PoF story. You get the raptor on the first map, springer on the second, and skimmer on the third. The jackal is obtained on the fourth map, and is optional. You need 25 gold to unlock it. If you're just rushing through the story I'd guess each map takes about 1-2 hours.

Eso had major expansion released this year and it's in wuiet solid state. I would risk stating it's in better state than GW2. 
---
Raids with Story Mode
---
I've heard a lot of people saying BfA wasn't great though.
---
end game content is subjective, and you don't **HAVE** to spend money on this game.
---
It feels like most of my CC abilities are easily countered or simply dodged through.
---
I can count in one hand the number of times that skill #3 actually connected but then again I'm probably just bad at the game.
---
You ran from Skritt!
---
I feel the same. I wonder why is that
---
i know this bitch, great work tbh :D
---
Awesome :) Love it.

Ascended trinkets are a full 10% (okay 9.5) better than exotics, *and* since trinkets make up a larger portion of your stat total than either weapons or armor, that difference is even more pronounced. It's not *quite* as big as the jump from rares to exotics but it's higher than any other tier's improvement. Yes, they're still not technically necessary, but it's a substantial enough improvement that it's hard to argue against.
---
When'd that start? Should've clarified that this was more than ten years ago. It was either in OGW or in CoH, where we met. 
---
I mean, you don't \*have\* to do every CM every day.
---
2018 was not that great, you’re just a bias fanboy. 
---
Which is depressing
---
every year (for maybe 4-5 years?) in gw2, there's a Pink Day in LA. i think it's part of a larger fundraiser for breast cancer research or something like that
---
&gt; As a side note you have to craft, buy or do a collection for backpacks. 
---
Do you know what the easiest way would be for a WvWer to get ahold of an ascended backpiece? I don't like doing any PvE at all if I can help it but I was wondering if there's an easy collection I could knock out or something.
---
I don't have to play the game at all! What a relief.
---
Still, it would put more strain on already separate part of a fractal community that does daily cm+t4 runs, further splitting it up. Some will stop doing 99, since, to be honest, it isn't worth the time already reward-wise, some won't be doing the new one and, if I know something about player psychology, there will be plenty of those who will stop doing anything at all. 
---
yes, I know that. my specific server question was just about wvw-part.
---
Well I really like the skull ones.
---
Thanks a lot for the great response, Mesmer and thief interest me the most currently.
