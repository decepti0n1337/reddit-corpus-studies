Okay but if it *did happen* my character couldn't fight against humans. I understand the pc in the game is basically the most bland nothing-bag of a character you could have but I can dream that he has some connection to his people. The point is that I never got to choose to join a human faction and now that is part of the pc's identity even though that episode was garbage filler.
---
---
---
I just like to share that info when I notice these posts just in case people don't know about the in game functionality.  I promise I did not mean it personally :)
---
Thank you for putting this together!
---
Nothing to do with autoloot.
---
Wasn’t taken personally. Part of my bad picture was not knowing if there was a timer at the end.
---
But the problem is that adding a new map will not fix the state of the game. Yes, right now the new map is fun. But in the long run, people are going to abandon it as they did with thunderhead peaks. Hence why the lower half of the deldrimor plate goes for more than the top half. Because it's hard to find a consistent group to do the meta. Fixing the problem of the game by adding a new map is just putting on a bandage when you have a deep cut. The bandage is going to open eventually. The novelty of the new map isn't going to be a long term solution. No one wanted Anet to work on another LW, especially after they finished the previous one. People want to have more content because Path of Fire isn't meeting people's expectations. PoF's notable changes are the mounts, which makes the core game and HoT a lot easier and the Renegade stance (imo, since Revenant was at a shit spot during PvE.)
---

---
People are going to eventually get bored with the new map in a couple of months or two.
---
And your right, League is esports. But it hasn't always started out like that. The only reason why it got big in the first place was that people had a reason to go back to playing it. It eventually got big to the point where people can profit from playing. If there was no rank system, there wouldn't be much of an incentive for people to keep playing. The player base would have been niche.
---
Developers have to put in care for their games if they ever want to see them have a future. GW2 isn't in a good spot right now. Most of my old guildmates have moved on from WvW to FFXIV since battles have been the same for the past 2 years.
---
They'll be abandoned by this time next year.
---
True. I avoided those stories because they're early development and other things notably got altered like Saul D'Alessio's and Dorian's names.
---
It's not the gear/build thing, it's the Legendary Insight requirements. You don't have to do these raids dozens of times to do them competently.
---
I faked them from the day I started raiding and nobody was the wiser.
---
This post got pretty long although I didn't intend for it to originally, but I really wanted to flesh out a lot of issues in one go for you.
---
I would say the players who start making demands, petty insults, and trashing the company because the game isn't released the exact way they think it should be, yes.
---
The reason I said anyone would look like an idiot trying to define a "normal" player is because the argument you've made is one of the easiest in the books to make. Obviously "normal" has little context when it comes to how anyone chooses to play a video game. If you're going to get hung up on semantics, then please let me know -- otherwise...
---
The point I was making is that the way players go about trying to get something from the devs is wrong, and nothing is ever going to improve about the situation unless they quit doing the exact thing that makes anet employees, for example, stop reading before a main point is ever reached.
---
Dissatisfaction is one thing. Being a free-to-play player is another. However, becoming overly dramatic and trying to raise hell on some internet forums isn't going to solve anything, yet somehow this is the popular thing to do because people feel like they can relate to those negative emotions. That alone is a bad sign for any single persons psyche, but that's not the point I'm making.
---
I have seen good posts that can criticize a company which actually get responses from employees. None of these posts are what I just mentioned. They aren't low-effort memes, posts that constantly express distaste -- or straight up hate -- for the people making the game. This scenario you describe is black and white, where the area a company, specifically a game company, will cooperate with its end-users is grey. Anet has shown with multiple changes in the past that they will listen to their players and do the right thing when it is appropriate for them to do so.
---
The biggest mistake any player, customer, etc. will ever make is falsely believing something along the lines of, "Oh, xxx company has gone downhill and will never return to their former prowess." As soon as that becomes someones reality, what reason does the company have to stick around and communicate with such a player? The company has its own numbers to track its success, it has nothing to do with novice editorialized opinion pieces.
---
Whatever nostalgia people hang onto isn't a baseline for success in the gaming industry. Now, I'm not saying the situation you're describing has to do with nostalgia, but GW2 is different in design from GW1. What I am saying is people who don't spend enough time reading about a lot of the issues that are brought up on the forums miss out on a lot when it comes to making suggestions.
---
It's apparent in your post, although I applaud you for your discretion, that you want me to stumble on the pitfall of build templates. What I will say is I do just want to see them in the game already. Obviously [a very vocal portion of the community wants to see them function similar to how they did in GW.](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Template) I'm not saying that those aren't valid concerns, because they are from the standpoint of anyone who raids, plays WvW, does fractals, and tries to otherwise try as much of the content as possible like myself. I know that with the current iteration that is due to be released, I will probably need to unlock more templates to store my most frequently used builds.
---
The problem is this: I am with a very small portion of my guilds who would actually need to buy extra slots to accommodate how I play the game. Most of the people I play with now don't even use arc for templates, and we have played since release. Aside from that, most people in my guilds have a main toon, not many builds (especially in my WvW guilds, obviously my raiding guilds need more builds), and no reason to use gear templates once they're released. The actual amount of times I've heard people in VoIP say that it won't make much of a difference for them or that they just want to see it in the game and try it out themselves, has been far greater on an individual basis when I've asked in-game.
---
There's obviously a reason for people to be upset about templates because they aren't going to be implemented like they were previously. GW2 saves its settings on the cloud and templates will be too. They won't be customizable like in GW1 because that's how the game keeps users settings consistent even if the game gets uninstalled or a hard drive crashes. These are the details that get left out of every argument in hopes that experienced players will overlook it while the vocal minority continues their tirade. Templates are designed and stored on a cloud that anet pays for players, free-to-play players included, to have. This isn't a free service to run, but the core game is available for free still.
---
I'm going to stand by the argument that has already been made multiple times on reddit and the forums which is that Anet allowed Deltaconnected to put templates into their addon in the first place, because it's true. It is also true that anet hasn't released a pipeline for their game outlining templates, and saved it for their live announcement which, I might add, was kept separate from PAX to allow PAX to fit smaller game companies into the center. That's an entire separate discussion for another time, but PAX is an actual example of something that's changed over the years, not just perceived by nostalgia.
---
This post has gotten quite long, but I hope this gives you a better understanding why I don't agree with most of the shit that gets popular on this site. The more digging I do, the more I find that when people chalk this game up to "having a big casual scene" or something along those lines making the experience worse for everyone, they usually leave out important details as to why that is the case to begin with, or are just lying and anyone who calls them out immediately gets downvoted or some brain dead, less than 3 letter, response. It's so fuckin toxic.
---
It's in the options menu, I think on the first page.
---
No worries. We all get a bit confused sometimes. :)
---
Beetle, skimmer and Jackal time races rewards bronze silver and gold chests daily and that's pretty ok amount of ToT bags.
---
as the other user says, mob/minion doors are always worth it.
---
boss doors are worth it if boss kill is a daily and veteran doors are worth it if open 5 doors is a daily.
---
most of your loot will come from just killing as many enemies as possible.
---
I'm in the NA Raid training discord and I'm noticing just how few organized groups there are running training sessions. There's only like 14 people who signed up to be trainers. Most groups require experience with the wing or boss to even get in the group, and training sessions seem to happen most often really late at night. 
---
I'd love to do more raids if I could just get accepted into runs where I could learn what I'm supposed to be doing without dragging everyone down.
---
Jormike Thysson
---
but why bother? You won't get all of the bonus chests if you try to solo it. Are so many people really doing it just for the challenge of soloing the construct?
---
Currently installing the free version. Any beginner tips, builds, classes, races that are good for starters?
---
in terms of learning how the game works? not really..but some find it fun or simply wanna take it slow or something
---
actually druid is a great example! it has almost nothing to do with core ranger in its playstyle or mechanics..basically leveling from 1-80 on ranger will teach you about nothing on how to play druid
---
here's what i would recommend:
---
find a build that you like(preferably power damage) and familiarize yourself with it..read the descriptions of your traits and skills to know exactly what they do
---
also play around with slight variations, especially in terms of utility skills because certain abilities are powerful yet situational
---
learn universal game elements: what each boon does, what each condition does, what breakbars and cc represents, reflects and projectile mitigation, how combo fields+finishers work, if you're new to mmos also include stuff like line-of-sight to group mobs or how to kite them etc.
---
if your goal in endgame means fractals and raids you might want to already get used to a specific rotation so you don't form bad habits and the wrong muscle memory
---
I mean that is literally the opposite of what happens in FF14 extremes. But the GW2 community is also pretty soft when it comes to calling things "elitist."

Happened to me. But worse, cause it was on the Arah Dungeon run version instead. Imagine having to repeat that. What I did differently the second time was to wait until the cinematic has finished, and then clicked on the chest and it didn't bug out for me.
---
OR new blood gives bad cohesion/synergy with both the game and the dev team themselves and produces shit results. 
---
I personally dislike the reward structure, but it's been that way for years and I don't expect any change.

Which mount do you use ?
---
Roller beetle.  Can't even come close on anything else -- gotta wind a very tight route with the beetle.

Hey it's Justin Trudeau
---
RNG is RNG
---
I wouldn't say it's a ton of people, but yes it's more for the challenge than the loot. Gw2 was never good about balancing challenge with loot outside of pve raiding, imo.
---
indeed, pretty sure that are the requirements for the item, would save some questions when it's on the wiki, you are on it so will let you do it haha
---
My advice for over jumping. **Never make short jumps**. If a gap is short and the target platform small, change when you start your jump or the angle you approach, to turn the short jump into a full length jump. This is especially applicable if you are presented with jumping across multiple tightly spaced horizontal stick like platforms, as you can angle your jump more along the lengths of the platforms to give your self a giant start and end space despite the stick like nature of the platforms.

I was able to ace it 4 times in a row with my first attempts (this year) before falling from a fumbled space-bar pres, (i really should get a mechanical keyboard, and yes i will blame my keyboard instead of my own unreliable hands).

Oh, crazy, you have screen shake on. I turned that off and never though about it again...
---
The essence appears in the the reward chest when you first open it and then is if you re-open the same chest after the cinematic. Something about that interaction reverts the chest from the one with the essence to the normal bonus reward chest.
---
Presumably accepting the reward quickly, before the cinematic, would work fine since you'd be accepting the rewards with the essence shown.
---
You can't right-click the chest: dungeons still have the old version of reward chests without the ability to right-click and immediately accept the contents. It'd be a nice little QoL feature if they upgraded those.
---
You stated the coffer is sellable for 70 gold, and his thought on that is after event, they will sell for more.   He's responding to something you said so how is that "not the topic here"?  It's very much the topic and on top of that, a great point since there are so many completionists in the game right now that will drop gold to get all the skins.
---
Christ.
---
No
---
TBF the oversized ~~shoulderpad~~ knob really fits the game's aesthetic.
---
Open em as you wish. RNG is the same. Like a flipped coin the chance is unique each time.
---
yeah heard it from a player i just assumed it was like some kinda superstition people have with RNG based things
---
Some people are like goalies in the NHL playoffs, very superstitious.  I don't think that the loot tables care though.

Aw man! I really wanted that but hey congrats, wear it well my dude

Woah, you got a boyfriend?! Rad!
---
There's quite an edge to your response, so I'm going to work around that to address the issue at hand: your example quoting token rewards is extremely specific and based on a lot of assumptions that may be outright wrong. 
---
First off, no one even discussed what rewards would be purchasable by these tokens, let alone how many you'd need or how many you'd get. That alone leaves a bit of wiggle room for balancing out reward vs effort. You've jumped straight to "it will be too hardcore and *people* will whine and then it will be welfare." I'm not even aware what you'd offer from this token system considering the current rewards. I'm sure there is room to negotiate between attractive rewards at a reasonable rate that leave players feeling accomplished but invested. Don't dismiss the idea out of hand, give it some thought.
---
Lmfao!

Me as well! Don't have to take off trinkets/armor too, because if someone mentions it you just say "minstrel". "Ok, carry on".

Lead a wvw guild and got a name for my self back in the days on blackgate. Right now i dont play a lot, it was both burn out for playing it for years and the fact that i have no real free time right now and in the coming years.

&gt; If you want to make quick money by selling now or want to speculate on a better price on the future is a thought that everyone might consider, but not really On topic.

He was talking about the future value of the coffer, *your chosen topic.*   You should welcome his conversastion, especially considering his comment was the most valued comment.

And if only most veteran completionists have the collection done by the end of the festival, than means teir will be a population of veteran completionists that will still need to complete the collection when the festival is done.  Considering it takes 16 skins to complete the collection,  the supply is limited, and you think traders will buy out the supply, then this really make it a sellers market after the festival and his information is even more valuable, making your post even more helpful.  Sure, go ahead and attack him for helping out.

It's more about the amps and quality of the PSU than the watts. If you want an opinion, post the model.
---
If you're using a AIO water cooler, or even a tower style air cooler, some component on your motherboard might be overheating without any way to detect it via software. The more detail you can give us about your system, the better educated our guesses can be (removing the side panel for example can cause issues). AMD drivers for example have had reported issues with the game, so knowing what versions you have tried would help us help you research the matter.
---
Are you seeing the same GPU core speed fluctuation in Witcher 3? That's often a sign of heat and/or power issues. Can you post a screenshot of the GPU tab in Task Manager when a drop happens? Preferably one that covers multiple drops. I'd also suggest taking note if the drops become more frequent with higher GPU utilization.
---
While 15 minutes isn't really long enough to stress test a system, it might be good enough if the drops start happening in-game much sooner than that. We need to figure out what exactly happens during those drops, which part drops the ball and in what manner, and for that we need data. If the logs don't reveal anything, your next step will be to figure out a way to reliably replicate the issue, and then start checking clocks, voltages, temperatures, and dependencies (does anything else happen at the same time/what other processes are doing when the drop happens, is there a set of conditions when the drops happen less frequently).
---
If you are using addons and/or multi-boxing, those too can cause instability that has little if anything to do with hardware itself (sometimes it's possible to brute force your way through software issue with a hardware "solution", so it's always best to deconstruct the issue over just replacing hardware, no matter how tedious it gets).
---
Just as a general life pro tip, if you're using Avast, get rid of it. Nothing good has ever come from that piece of misery. I'd also keep an eye on the Antimalware Service Executable process, it too holds the power to ruin your day.
---
It’s okay on low level fractals and dungeons but it’s absolutely not in high level fractals and raid. Sorry, but I don’t want to queue and get some guy playing his WvW build, thinking he is useful when he is actually not.
---
It maybe sounds toxic for some players but it is really not. Hard/high level content need good builds to be done correctly, especially if it’s content many players know well already and run on a daily basis (fractals). I’m all fine with ppl playing a power reaper instead of some other better power build on the paper. I’m okay with running T4 without having alacrity because finding en renegade was too long. But the builds have to be good enough and I don’t think there is a good queue system that could assure with how GW2 is built.
---
Shit my bad I should really have put that in the title :((((
---
yall gotta get your ears checked
---
When the squad needs to split I call it out in squad/map chat(with markers). And check in with the people there if they have enough people.  
---
Usually most splitting events can be done with a few people, so as long as there's a few people who go there it should be good.  
---
I don't always know every single mechanic. but if i don't know a lot about the event I run it a few times with other squads, then have wiki open to help me when I command.
---
You can ask your guild to help you, and don't be afraid to put your own squad in LFG! Just state in the description 'new player all welcome' or something :)
---
Open them is not worth in any way

GW2 Beta player here, I remember trying gw1 once long before gw2 came out, but never actually purchased and played through the whole story until the sequel was announced. Since then I've been actively been playing through all living story updates and haven't missed one yet.

[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Visage\_of\_Madness](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Visage_of_Madness) it is a decoration
---
If they do it that way for the challenge and not for the loot, then devs did good job.
---
It is not wrong to play for personal sense of acomplishement, some rewards are just carrot on a stick for lazy people.
---
Agree, but I also hate people that spams CC!!!! in chat (or "DON'T CC" in case of Mouth of Mordrem) Like people who don't CC propadly don't even know what that is, so spamming chat doesn't really help anybody...
---
It's alright, thanks for the build
---
Is that skeleton based on Tom? :D
---
My experience is that condi mirage never does better than okay in open world content. That said, it's okay. Not awful, not spectacular. It's certainly viable, but the damage it does can be a bit slow if enemies don't move much and attack slowly (core Tyrian enemies often fall into this category). You sort of whirl through combat applying conditions and then have to wait around a bit for them to all finish ticking and then everyone sort of collapses at the same time. 
---
For meta events, I found I was missing a lot of the rewards because I just wasn't getting enough damage in quickly enough. I would keep a greatsword as your weapon swap because it's **built** for meta events and tags everything everywhere.
---
But that is not looted only when you slack on top islands, aka are out of 5000 range...
---
&gt; Put a big Mersenne prime, store it on 64 bits, ask an employee what's  their bank debt, idk. Then add a Withdraw button similar how is to the  left where we introduce the amount we like to withdraw.

Indeed it is!

Hello. i have just checked Arguably Foodlike. There are 2 achievements. One is 150 pieces of candy corn for 5 AP and it is in section Shadow of the Mad King and another is (Annual) Arguably Foodlike under section Halloween Rituals and indeed there are 300 pieces. i will probably make point about it on website. 
---
Capital letter in Fashion fixed.

Thank you very much for pointing it out!

Thank you for updoot! :)

Thank you for your kind words :).

You are welcome i am glad it helped.

I will sir!

Doing Halloween Lab with guild TS and just randomly I ask my mates if they know why at one day of farming the loot is nonexisting. They were surprised this happens to me. I hitting with the necessary 1000 points/mob on a shortbow thief and all I got after killing 5 mobs I got a skull for the trash. No bags.
---
I had the same boosts on as the days before.
---
One round in a labyrinth full with spawned mobs (only mobs, no bosses) I got 36 bags. I sticked to the commander and did around the same level of tagging as days before where the loot was much higher.
---
This held up the hour after and I stopped farming because of it.
---
Can anyone give me a clue what is happening? My mates say this is unusual for them but for me it's a more common event.
---
I'd suggest just trying things out and saving the boost. If you want to get a quick feel for a profession you can jump into the PvP lobby with it and it unlocks everything while there to try out on the training golems and NPCs (don't need to actually PvP). You can also try out the level boost and decide not to use it but it sets you up with usually bad stats so killing things in that zone goes slower than it should (and you can't swap stats around like you can in PvP). The generic new player profession suggestions you'll get are usually warrior, ranger, and necro with maybe a guardian too. For open world with the expansions there really are a ton of options for all professions though and I can't tell you what you're going to like :)
---
I dont want to take a dump on you, but if you want some feedback I can give my two cents.
---
might just be the camera you used, but the logos looks very shoddy to me. The dragon looks like a big red blob and the text looks jagged.
---
Then the knob that people already mentioned, is sorta big.
---
Hope it wasnt too harsh, it's just why I personally dont like its design, congrats on winning either way! :)
---
First i thought this was yet another rant post about WvW in EU (where people often call gates doors) that i don’t understand. Tried to parse up the meaning of it untill i realized it is halloween again, isn’t it?
---
Trash mechanics built by a a trash company for a trash game. Can’t get any trashier than storage for trash.
---
i might not do speedruns but dont you usually take portal to move people between locations while the others are doing something and not just leave them while you go out to the next spot after the encounter has already ended?
---
from the video description:
---
&gt;This is no longer possible since they removed the ability to start the race on griffon at high speeds, but it was fun while it lasted!
---
so much hate on strike mission. Hope anet wont listen to you guys, and wont make it super hard like you want. I dont want another raids or fractal CM content that no one is doing, and to find a party  you need to suck some dicks or post Kill proofs. Anet leave the strokie mission like it is, and make hardcore downvoters quit finally.
---
When they add Strike missions to aerodrome, it will be end of them. Most casual players have this simple understanding that if something is in aerodrome, it's a raid. Just like if you need to go through mists portal, it's a fractal.
---
Regarding the mobs part - it depends on the event, but part of it is knowing on what parts to focus on. For example in the Amala fight the earth elemental doesn't give loot, so you need to ignore it. You need to direct people to focus on important/lucrative parts of the event first and ignore the non important parts. (Markers are usefull for that to mark important targets.)  
---
Communicating with the squad will get more of them to focus on the right targets.  
---
Also DS is hardly efficient from a gpm standpoint.... When you can cram a gem meta every 15~ish minutes, DS is simply a net loss as it takes almost an hour.  
---
The way to 'farm' DS is: open your lanes pods during meta, open other lanes during dead times(waiting for other lanes to reach the towers), finish meta, treasure shrooms, do all the pod routes(especially the 'secret' pods) as a group, fit more shrooms between routes.
---
IF you want to max magic find do it during the Chinese new year, buy as much envelopes in the 1.4g range as you can and open them in silverwastes with all bonuses you can find. With max mf each envelope should give you an average of 1.39g for the absolute cheapest way to buy luck. 
---
Go to wiki for guide to maxing your mf, only problematic boon is the magic find boost which is acquired only by retired booster and bonfire (7 statuettes) and maybe by candy cane gobbler(it gives mf boost but dont remember if it is item boost or mf boost). Bonfires are pretty common in silverwaste during the event so you can have that going for you. Also, grab your tp and bank teleport to fully utilize the 50 minutes of max SW mf bonus. 
---
Ecto salvage is way more expensive, averaging around 50c-1s loss per ecto and only viable if you do it for someone else ie someone wants dust, sends you ecto, you salvage it and send dust back to keep the luck.
---
Hi! Yes it is true I am not native speaker. I like that idea about discord so I will make one in near future. Thank you.
---
In all my years of playing wvw (80% of which was roaming) i have yet to see someone in any chat to refer to gates as doors.
---
I did the same thing a week ago. Support restored her within a couple of days. You are going to be alright.
---
Because of the amount of trash that drops from this bas drops I recommend opening them on a new character and once you are done simply delete the character.
---
I think mount maelstrom also belongs to the maguma jungle. I remember something about this map being odd in some way.
---
At this point I would literally take anything. I just feels wrong to keep on stacking luck when there's a consume button and it feels wrong to delete it. There's not escape!
---
No had the same problem on EU
---
There is a dedicated chinase server of GW2 that is quite P2W
---
Are we really talking that much about one single boss that can be autoattacked to death by a single staff thief? Okay then. Fuck, man...
---
I don't know about the dungeon thing, but I think selling elite specs would put the final nail in GW2's "everything on the store is pure cosmetic and optional". I let the build templates slide because we get at least some for free. But with elite specs it's not really working that way.

Really? I see it all the time but i mainly roam on a german server.

You need to own PoF anyways to be able to play this Saga.

I soloed him a few years ago with my guardian.... took a while but wasnt even downed once.

I would love to get a build link :)

isnt just normal exotic armor for mf?

Very nice!

If I may suggest one "improvement": It would be great if achievements that require player to kill x number of specific mobs (like Ancient Grudge) had also mentions of the areas where player can find a lot of them or basically where player can farm them effectively.

ofc the hong kong/china situation is relevant, but the blitzchung or the "blitzzard is controled by china" BS is not. (tencent holds 5% of act/bliz and makes around 13% of their money in china btw. I think thats less than some companies you still support in some way)

the hypocrisy of many many "outraged" gamers and most gaming communities in the last years is whats SO annoying about it.

Unid gear doesn’t work with MF anymore. Since like six months ago or so.
---
If you have good commie, when zerg come to doors with veteran mobs, he will wait at door to get whole zerg together, bcz vets fall too much quickly, so if you are at tail of zerg, the door event will end before you reach it, and you dont get hit and miss the event, or for example door with lich king or viscunt are always closed, bcz these boses are extremely annoying, someone care, someone not (but honestly, even after 7 years ppl still dont know, how to fight these boses, its quite disturbing..)
---
This lmao
---
They're pretty right tho
---
People nowadays use the "free speech" card to get away with anything they say. Bringing up politics to a children's card game tournament isn't really free speech. People want less politics in their games but somehow they want more of this. I find it hypocritical.
---
Well, they can always add entrances to dungeons and fractals there.
---
It's obviously a joke post, don't worry.
---
&gt;At one point during development, this zone featured a completed Canthan  district and included a blend of Asian architectures. However, this mix  of styles received negative feedback from CHINA and KOREA, since those  gaming markets traditionally prefer a uniform design.  
---
From the wiki..so not only China, and the district was not further developed because china said no but because of time restrictions.
---
Ye, that's freedom
---
Nope

Pretending to keep politic away form anywhere _is politic_

15k gems ez gogogo anet
---
no
---
Not that pricey :/
---
I would pay within 2,000 gems :-)
---
Yeah, 15k is a bit much, your right
---
&gt;There are some people who get paid around 300 500 dollars a month and use that money to feed their family. Be a bit more empathetic.
---
What? They get paid 300-500 per month, are strapped on cash, are spending it on a game, and you want empathy? They need to be responsible with their finances, that really doesn't seem a position to be looking to spend money on a game with a f2p base.
---
Newer items should have higher IDs than old ones, but you never know with Anet's inconsistency ;).
---
there wont be next expansion so they will have to change launcher at some point as its getting old. Maybe an option to choose a skin could be possible? Like 1 for each race, the old one from classic and HoT. Or maybe even let us choose custom one so we would be able to create and share some here on reddit.     
---
Someone people could then choose erotic ones , like one with Norn girl with big hips, or charr with big penis if thats your thing. It would make players excited when launching the game, so they will be less sad when they would see there is no new content.
---
You know that you can do the skimmer race with a griffon? some people do that and the terrain around the race make this even easier.
---
Plz dont be the reason for a payed Launcher Ilyavi xD
---
Look at the Templates :P
---
I don't think you understood my message. Let me give you an example. Would it be fair if I got banned from a heartstone tournament for saying: "Fuck/Vote Trump 2020" out of the blue? I think it would be fair. An hearthstone tournament isn't the place for politics.
---
When you feel that light, single thread of spider web touch you around your neck
---
I am pretty sure top 1 uses a Gryphon.
---
But I’m really sick of Balthazar and at this point I’m willing to do that to get rid of that horrid launcher xD
---
Well whatever it is, I want it soon. Like tomorrow soon. Just get rid of Balthazar please!
---
As far as I have understood it you have 2 things
---
* The gear template(s)
---
* The equipped gear
---
The gear templates will store the gear for that particular template and what you have equipped right now can be, but doesn't have to be, what is in the template.
---
For example, in the stream, they talked about that you can switch skills on the fly like you normally do and that it doesn't affect the template. I would imagine that this works with gear as well.
---
Which means that you can switch the gear on the fly like weapons like you always could and it will not affect your gear template. Switching to that template will equip everything again in that template and unequip everything that is not and if it isn't used in one of the templates it will move to your inventory and if there is no space then you will not be able to complete switching to that gear template.
---
If you have multiple characters with the same gear set you then can use it like you always did but you won't be able to use the template for it since those gear templates are for the character and not the account and removing it from the character (like putting it in the bank) will remove it from all of the templates that use it.
---
So, what would change for you is that pretty much everything stays the same but you can now load your skills and traits from a template.
---
np!
---
I liked Dulfy's videos in the clean light of the snowy dungeon entrance. The preview window often doesn't demonstrate in-game lighting effectively.
---
Congrats! I remember my first time. Took me hours of gruelling failure until I finally managed to make it. The exhilaration!
---
As far as i know if you take that gear off it will be stored in the magic realm called armory.  
---
So if you want to equip the gear on a different character you have to delete the template so you will have the gear back in your inventory and be able to move it to the other character.
---
My information might be wrong or just old we will see on 29th.
---
But if my information remains correct have fun with the same gear on multiple chars -.-
---
would you mind sharing where you got that? (can't find a translated vid)
---
That's what I figured. I've played to long to risk my account but it's an interesting idea at the least.
---
I think you missed the fact that this is a joke post.
---
Sounds like we worked for the same company tbh. :D
---
Dumping millions of dollar into a new software project. Hire "managers" to take over the lead, but they screw it up even more. Nobody wants to make any decision because it could fall back on them. The few people actually knowing their stuff either left because of that, or were fired because they asked all of the right questions nobody wanted to answer.
---
Really happy that I don't need to deal with that BS anymore...
---
Okay, I haven't viewed the page in its entirety, sorry.
---
Most of the time its because there's a delay anyway. It takes a small 5 seconds before the fighting starts, if the commander is in field of view, just open the door
---
How?
---
We'll cross the streams!
---
I think you understood me wrong. I meant - if you add Strike Missions to aerodrome, they will become "raids" under a different name for a large group of people. I call them "casuals" but this is more of a "players who do not want to participate in raids" since "casual player" has way too wide meaning. 
---
Quick skimming through the wiki I found a list of things that are not raid-related but are in aerodrome at the moment - anvil, bank, trading post and laurel merchant. So for now any player can safely assume that if entrance to something is in aerodrome, that something is either raid or raid-related (for example raid training arena is there).
---
It's not like raids have entrances *only* in aerodrome. Each raid has it's own special entrance somewhere in the world, just like dungeons. However, while raids have another all-in-one entrance hub in aerodrome, no other content shares it with them. If you add dungeons to for example list of fractals (to allow everyone enter from mists portal in LA), it will not change what they are, but many people will think they are fractals. The same with Strike Missions - if you add them to aerodrome, many will think they are raids. I think Strike Missions need new separate central hub, and I would love for it to be in another city (not LA).
---
&gt; gaming market drama
---
that is not a gaming market drama, it's their government controls our companies drama.
---
Okay, we'll just tack this onto the end of the list of things ANET will never fix #3,429.
---
It's a reused instance?
---
Doesn’t look Cuban to me...
---
Anet is taking making more and more things not be affected by magic find, they won't increase it when they are actually trying to make it less impactful.
---
It's why the only company a Necromancer keeps is the undead, because a Reaper doesn't need any help from the living.
---
It's almost as if you completely missed the whole point of the very post you responded to.
---
Ice tooth prosthesis probably :D
---
What I am trying to say is that you can't possibly predict the way players who do not want to participate in raids would feel about adding strike mission entrances to the aerodrome because there is no precedent. Your comment was just a jab at people who don't raid, which is fine, we all shitpost from time to time.
---
Well congrats on your achievement as well!
---
The new stuff is still in Beta guys. Wait for it to go live in a patch tonight or maybe Tuesday once we're done doing the testing for ANET.
---
I have the same problem, I use the "account-bound" aspect of ascended and legendary items to share them across multiple characters, so templates won't work.

I like the commander’s foot key. Works every time (with Canuch’s help sometimes)

The drama is irrelevant. Nothing will change because those companies are private entities that allowed for those things to happen in exchange for chinese money. There is no crime, just greed. Companies sell decision power all the time to many entities to get funding for their projects.
---
No, toxic casuals are way worse. Raiders are just annoyed that too few people give the little effort needed to raid.

Actually Fractal CMs are pretty easy, and quite a few raid bosses are even easier...

Tbh the hardest thing about raids is having to deal with Raiders... (there are some hard bosses but most are pretty easy)

You can leave. No-one is holding a gun to your head to make you stay here. We won't be surprised pikachu if you leave. We will happily continue to play a game we enjoy while you hopefully happily play a game you enjoy, or do something else with your life. Seriously, your misery is not wanted here. As much as we want GW2 to succeed with as many players as it can get, we can do without the "wasted potential" club.
---
That's just objectively not true. Plenty of the things you mentioned are part of the strike.

I think it's time you bought an iPhone 11...that iPhone 3GS is way out of date.
---
No 1 's score is most likely to be 54.2 XD
---
Yes, taking into consideration every template.
---
That's a fair point. Given how much you can turn a statue for (even with the most valueable items  plus time and not just the one to one statue to gold conversion) 2,5g bottomline is way above average. Sure sometimes there are edge cases with finishers (6g maybe higher per statue) but for the majority of players it is a pretty good rate. At least if gold is the main goal. If used for convenience it may differ.

I've been playing since GW2 beta, mostly daily.  I play all the expansions and living story episodes and finish all the meta achievements.  In the time that I've been playing GW2, I met my husband, got married, and we're now expecting our first child!  :)
---
Simple solution, raise the cap to infinity (or max integer size) but make the cost in essences to go up exponentially. This way you get rid of essences, but you dont create too much of a problem with higher MF on some players.
---
&gt; But its still important to do anything with luck after it
---
Why?
---
As a casual raider i can confidently say thats not true.
---
I fought him yesterday with my 10 yr. old. Not hard at all.
---
You have my upvote!!!
---
sigh i love how ppl think they know why a programmer set a limit.
---
Or have the luck needed to go from 300 forward be insanely high, so even the rich cant go far
---
Tbh, I don't think it's a lot of work to make some different launchers. Why not add a launcher for every festivity and maybe season and then just cycle through them.
---
Ps: give charr a bit more room please! (In launcher and any preview window)
---
When luck is only there to achieve 300% MF, why do they provide it even after we reach the set goal? In some recepies, ok. But i have 3 Times the Luck which is needed for 300% and now i need a reason to safe it. I could just consume/delete it, but i wont do that until anet has an official response to it.
---
1. I think this could help, but I also like the idea of them being only accessible via the open world portals like dungeons. This is more for keeping it feeling like a cohesive universe rather than a series of instances that we insta-warp to all the time. What I think sucks about Ep.o's strike is that the portal is SO far away from the nearest waypoint. IF there was a waypoint there, it wouldn't be so bad but you have to go from the far end of the keep.
---
2. This is why I think everyone wants to see them up the difficulty/add difficulty options, because this is clearly an interesting boss with cool mechanics, but you can avoid a lot of them (On barrier engie I got the achievements all on the first try in story and strike without paying any attention to mechanics :| )
---
3. Agreed. Rewards are best when there's multiple ways of accessing them. I can see why they don't want to add some sort of token system because they already have a LOT of currencies and every one they add needs to have a sink and a faucet etc. It would be nice, though, to have a guaranteed/fairly common drop of some unique crafting material to use to craft the super rare rewards. Tune the numbers how you need to to keep people playing the content regularly, but still
---
4. Is there really all that much in the Strike? I remember there's like a 3 second window where Crecia is talking but the charr NPC hasn't yet opened the path, but I don't think there's ANY stalling dialogue elsewhere. This is something I actually really liked about the strike. The dialogue happens as you're walking so it doesn't take time away from a tryhard run but it's also still there for new players. I don't think such a tiny delay merits such an angry response. I get it in other content where it's like "shut the fuck up, Taimi/Dessa/whoever, I just want to kill the boss"
---
A good commander waits for... at least 80% of the group to be at the door so everyone can get loots. There will always be stragglers and people doing their own thing.
---
When people solo open a door, they take away loot from other players, which is a dick move. Especially considering doors are on a timer and there can be 10 minutes sometimes between events popping and doors.
---
In all honesty, my reasons shouldn't need to be given at all. There is not a real need for any sort of context on why I would or wouldn't use something. I ONLY mentioned I don't use it because I felt it was relevant to the topic at hand and why it didn't affect me. But now I realize I should have just said my sympathies and moved on. Because this whole thread was ridiculous. Also no idea why Nike is being so aggressive toward me. I have never even said anything to or about them before. But I did follow their you tube channel. Not sure I will anymore though cause damn I didn't even do anything wrong except use a term I thought was the right one.
---
Isn't dark harvest the reaper collection weapon IIRC?
---
Imagine when that datamined challenge mode comes in. It would be really easy to make that challenge mode have the same loot as a raid on a weekly cooldown as an additional incentive for new players to get into it. "Hey, I can get a free 2g, an exotic drop, and an ascended material or two? Shit, I should get into this. Wait, this is what raids get you too?"
---
This is why I don't even mind if they stay fairly easy, I just want them to have the mechanics in them, even if those mechanics can be avoided or ignored by the high end of the playerbase.
---
I dyed my farming armor bright florescent orange to avoid that. Look like a deer hunter in the woods but I'm used to seeing my Daredevil in mostly Shadow Abyss and Midnight Fire. The orange is ridiculous and over the top, but good for Halloween and a good reminder. Maybe I'll go bright red with white trim for wintersday.
---
That's cumulative damage, not a single hit.
---
5k IQ right there
---
my reaper can solo easy
---
Because the people that have MF maxed are a tiny minority of the playerbase.
---
The fact that they somehow are psychologically unable to delete excess luck stacks also doesnt deserve any special attention from Anet.

You should also always carry a Plains Pebble as it slows down the rate you consume water.

This. People are mad that Blizzard does not want to make a political statement and does not want to be seen supporting any either. For a global company, this is simple to understand. They don't want the company to be about politics, because it tends to get in the way of business.
---
Now, you may want the company to put its weight into politics one way or another. You may have good reasons and intentions. But most likely you wouldn't need to suffer the possible consequences either, so this is an easy statement to make.
---
What game mode are we talking here?
---
&gt; mechanics to avoid
---
And yet people manage to get down.
---
there are many problems with those old festival games, mostly because they are based on the PvP system and not PvE instances.
---
The only reason why you have such a high critchance is because of a renegade trait that gives you +33% at full endurance. So, do you not expect yourself to ever dodge?
---
Outside of that, optimizing really should be done in a context, what exactly you are optimizing it for.
---
two ways seen so far, blizzard way or rocket way; 
---
which of these ways you feel comfortable, so far?
---
as a hongkonger in China, I still choose the rocket one. 
---
how's your choice in American or elsewhere in world?
---
Whatever gives the most AP, followed by whatever gives slightly less AP.
---
Sometimes a potato is just a potato, man.
---
what do you mean with cheated? early boost? griffon?
---
^
---
What rune do you use?
---
How could you not? *This game is all about efficencye1!!1!one!1*
---
It's still valid to use for competition with friends and guildies, which is what I'm using it for atm. I just pretend the number 1 doesn't exist in that regard
---
They could make that extra luck a "fuel" for an extra luck boost.
---
* Any luck after reaching the 300% MF cap would be stored as 'fuel'.
---
* While having luck fuel, you'd have a MF boost equal to the MF bonus from Achievement Rewards x3. So if you have 20 AP luck, this will give you +60.
---
* Every time you do something that produces a MF calculation, the fuel would go down by an amount depending on the level of the drop tables. For example, level/8.  So level 80 drop tables will consume 10MF per roll. Same as a Fine essence of luck.
---
 * For enemy drops, the level of the enemy will be used. For bags affected by MF that scale with the character, the level of the character will be used.  For bags that do not scale, the level of the bag will be used. For non-scaling bags without a level, they will be given the level of the lowest level enemy that can drop the bag.
---
* The upper cap could be increased to a nice round number, like 500 000. Or maybe make it a luck thing, and make the cap 777 777, and 888 888 during Canthan new year. Any extra past 777 777 consumed during Canthan would not be lost when the cap goes down, it'll stay there being used, you'd simply not be able to add more until you are under 777 777 again.

The maps, the living world season 2 story which leads into HoT, season 3 story which leads into PoF and season 4.
---
I use Valkyrie armor with beserker trinkets and beserker weapons. I really like having the extra health with no damage loss. I think if you’re building a more selfless build you could go diviner’s and have less health but I find Valkyrie with fireworks runes are great for open world. I think the strength runes are overkill with heroic command
---
He grew himself a new tooth made of ice?  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
So that 20$ is PoF, which includes HoT?
---
I think you’re wrong and right at the same time. I enjoy the extra health my full Valkyrie set gives me, it’s saved my life on massive single strikes so many times (most recently that super fear damage from the boss in the labyrinth) but I agree, diviner’s makes boons trivial to even worry about because they’re literally always there now
---
No, their DPS was pretty low. Also: it didnt matter.
---
I don't care if skorvald lasts 10 seconds ir 30 seconds per phase, only an idiot QQs about that in a goddamn Pug.
---
Every1 here thinks they are god gifts to fractals and that taking 3 seconds more per phase is unacceptable, then i see them play and they are worse than 100 ess players... Some can't even solo the bosses but they keep yapping about how DPS this and meta that.
---
Newsflash: its a Pug farm run noone fucking cares as long as you do over 15k DPS. 15k vs 25k i don't care, noone does (unless you are so inexperieced that you can't stay alive for 5 extra seconds)
---
Suddenly I want a hostage-rescue event in wvw
---
I've also been thinking about dropping the Strength Runes, but that's pretty low on my priority list.    Thanks.
---
I thought about it a few years ago given that the engine provides for it; the hostages would only have two skills one that privides swiftness and the other that heals.
---
I also thought about a capture the flag type of game in wvw where the flag could be an Orb-type like those in PvP.
---
Well to be fair, it still has Power, Precision and Ferocity.  I'll get around to replacing it with a Zerk bow, but I'm very lazy.
---
I have an example of wait for the commander: fighting the Labrythian Horror and the nearby door was the Legendary Candy Corn elemental. Group was decent but not enough for two bosses.
---
It's turkey?
---
I dont understand what she said..
---
Check out Wooden Potatoe's best builds for Open World, and tweak it for yourself.  He has a lot of different classes.
---
I think each season is roughly as long as an expansion, or maybe a bit longer (assuming you're just playing through the story in both cases).
---
Well considering not all the Shouts have voice acting recorded... Doubt they'll get to fixing mantras any time soon.
---
What I mean is that Renegade's shortbow is a condition damage weapon, wether ir has Berserker or Viper stats. The weapon is designed for condition damage builds because of all the bleeding and burning effects it applies. That doesn't mean you can't use it on a power build, but it's suboptimal
---
Some weapons are designed for condition damage builds and are absolutely trash in power builds, like Necromancer's scepter or Mesmer's staff. Revenant's shortbow isn't as bad as those 2 I just mentioned in power builds, but it pales greatly compared to sword sword, or the crowd control of staff 5, or the range of hammer
---
Yes it may be 5-10 (20 is an exaggeration).
---
You know what's also slower? Having the perfect team (which takes longer in lfg) and then i afk to grab a beer. Or someone dcs. Or has a phone call. Or whatever.
---
DPS phases are already a small % of the fractal (beacuse you have load screens, walking, puzzles and stuff).
---
Again, if spending 10 extra minutes than you would have *IF YOU HAD A DREAM TEAM* (which you do not, because it's a Pug, and lfging them takes longer than running the thing with whatever) is a deal breaker for you... Well... In my honest oppinion you are not a very competent player.
---
Do feel free to disprove me with video evidence; i'm tired of arguing with reddit SC wannabes that totally do sub 10 min 0 heals clears pugging every night, all the while filling their 250+ ess team in under 10 minutes.
---
Inb4 i have literally pugged HUNDREDS of times and never saw that.
---
Ok, thx for the info
---
Has anyone suggested a night mode for the site yet?
---
Yeah but renegade shortbow is perfectly capable of being used as a power weapon. You’re correct in the fact that S/S has more damaging abilities but 3/5 of them have condi on them too and the shortbow auto ticks up so fast, especially with impossible odds, that just autoing does crazy damage in a power build. Just because it has conditions on the skills doesn’t mean it has to be used that way. Hammer is just a slower, not as strong short bow honestly and staff is only used for the 5 skill, maybe the 3 skill too. If you’re running around in open world a Shortbow with S/S on swap is an excellent pairing for the flow of combat with mobs and on non-break bar enemies. I don’t think the shortbow is suboptimal by any means in a power build
---
Dude, the main taco websiote, where you downloaded it from shows the contributers. On top of tekkits reactiff pack is also quite useful
---
Don't worry about servers unless you want WvW.
---
Reasonable people in blizzard hating threads. Interesting
---
Every class can be built into a strong solo class, and every class is viable in raids, though some classes are more preferred than others. 
---
The most common healer role is druid, which is one of the elite specialisations for the ranger class.
---
The entirety of the core game is free with some restrictions, but buying the path of fire expansion (which comes with the first expansion as well) will be necessary for raids and accessing the elite specialisations of each class.
---
Server only matters for World vs World, which is large-scale PvP. All open-world PvE uses megaservers so all players play together.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdxmChRD2epfS9j4gS8D-tdQbPAajODOv](This) youtube series on open world builds won't be directly applicable, but there is some discusion of what makes open world builds strong and can give you an idea of what to consider when making your own build.
---
Make sure to run in “windowed fullscreen” not “fullscreen” seems to have fixed it for me
---
That and lowering sound quality and using fixed 60fps seemed to fix the same issue for me

FPS was fine for a while but randomly the game would freeze for several minutes at a time, and I was unable to force quit, when the game unfroze it was fine again

yes it is, see the link that random has provided.  And starting this year you can also get the [Pumpkin Crown](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pumpkin_Crown).
---
Yep.  And while typically skins earned in game / achievement tend to be inferior to those you get from BL chest / tickets / Gem store, the Dark Harvest model is impressive and complements my look perfectly.
---
ANet also doesn't have any product big enough to make splash.
---
Play the free game see if you like the base mechanics. Path of Fire and Heart of Thorns are packaged together now and 50% off so it is a good time to buy if you like it. A good starter class is Necro as they can handle most open world content solo if you go into a minion mancer build. Very tanky and good damage output.

i find it disturbing that someone could open 100,000 loot boxes and not get some of the items listed as being a possible drop
---
Just to make everyone hate me I opened around 100 bags so far this year and got 2 of the infusions...
---
My wife really wanted Mini Zuzu Cat of Darkness. 20 Candy Corn Cobs was pretty daunting but we set about collecting treat bags. I don't know why but at the end of the night I decided to check the Trading Post and found him for 9s. She's was super happy and just goes to show how much Halloween items need to be fixed.
---
I wouldn't separate profit motive from politics considering that companies use politics all the time in order to pursue their profits.
---
casuals, im at 101 with 100 bags. 2300mf helps.
---
thanks, are the haunted weapons also available?
---
Question, do you think the chance is higher if you use a Charr to open the chest?
---
https://i.imgur.com/OD2i5Ka.mp4
---
NEVER!!!
---
When did companies use politcs at esports tournaments at the scale the banned player did? Shouting your propaganda even if it's for a good cause shouldn't be done in these circumstances.
---
This is seriously stupid. I hate the game more and more for hiding infusions behind stupidly impossible random chance loot.
---
Just like how I am not buying glider skins or mount skins because there's almost none acquirable in-game.
---
The monetization is really stupid for a B2P MMO.
---
There's just no point in going for these 0.000000001% drops.
---
I will simply continue to ignore infusions for that reason. Fuck that shit.
---
Join a Mad King's Labyrinth group in the Open World Squads section of LFG. Don't need to be level 80.
---
you clock sucker
---
I haven't done any Halloween stuff yet (or anything past logging in for like a month), but I remember many long commander runs last year kind of just detangled with a secondary, untagged group running ahead, killing everything they could, and dying to Steve.  
---
I just started a new map whenever that happened.
---
You get haunted skins by doing the halloween daily 5 times, so yes. The repeatable achievement is called "Eve of the Mad King".
---
I would shop around a little more, GW2 is all about fashion wars and loves to push microtransactions for any decent QOL upgrades. The combat is probably the greatest aspect of the game, the zones and environments are beautiful and very 3 dimensional. Diminishing returns really stops you from being able to farm any mats besides resource nodes. And RNG on goodie bags such as Hallows eve and wintersday is brutal.
---
QB runs zerker gear mainly, with some diviner trinkets to increase boon duration.  
---
So you can start playing it but you'll need to add some diviner pieces when you get to T3 fractals to be able to maintain boons.

---
What do you think of this?
---
BTW, As a mainlander, I think political message is not fit for a sports event.
---
How and why are the weapons that have been out for 3+ years rarer than the brand new reskin box???
---
It's only logical, it's only *one* player. 
---
While Halloween *millions* of bags are opened. If you get everything from only 100k bags, none of the worthy items would be worthy anymore. 
---
Oh, and:
---
&gt; loot boxes
---
They are normal drop bags, not loot boxes by definition.
---
&gt; Obligatory "tHaT'S RnG DoN'T YoU KnOw sTaTiStIcS" comment that has nothing to do about the perception and feel of game design. -signed, Internet
---
It *is* a bit disturbing, but ANet almost never (..have they ever?) builds in controls to their RNG to accommodate individual luck rates. They're pretty much counting on hundreds of thousands of players in each server group generating thousands of bags, in order to release maybe a few hundred "super rare" items. Gives those specific items value and keeps players grinding at available content.
---
Why would there be? That would add quite the unfair hidden advantage to a subset of characters.
---
Characters are threaded exactly the same as far as those aspects of the game mechanics are concerned.
---
I mean, every player can choose what he is okay with or not. That’s why everyone can create his own group in LFG...
---
But I think we share the same PoV about builds. I’m also okay with having a condi scourge or other « good » builds (even if not meta). Actually, I prefer doing longer run (I don’t care much if a boss fight last 1 more minute than usual) with good and chill players than some toxic douche whining at every single and negligible mistake.
---
Me and the GGShield I pulled off of two BLC keys salute your good fortune!
---
The R in RNG stands for Random, it’s not ‘G’ for guarantee.
---
They don't lie at all. The categories at just less accurate than percentages. 
---
It's like 100-20% = common, 20-5% = uncommon, 5-0.1% = rare and 0.1-0.0001% = super rare.
---
... I hope not?
---
Oh boy, that'd certainly be something though - so many very angry folks.
---
(and for [](#s "buying our bags :^)") )
---
This greedy attitude from ANet is one of the reasons I've lost all desire to play.
---
You mean the one I intentionally emphasized, because it proofs my point? Just because something is typically *A*, doesn't mean *A* is a requirement. Loot boxes are "*typically*" monetized, not "*always*".
---
Are enemies "*a consumable virtual item which can be redeemed*"?
---
The drops from bags aren’t affected by MF, but MF does affect how often and how many drop when you murk a mob.
---
Loot boxes you have to actively obtain by playing a games content?  Yep, monster drops are definitely loot boxes.
---
Tell me what your objection is to that versus just killing an enemy and having them drop items from a loot table then.
---
Oof. Those things have the same drop rate as a pre
---
Just a note as well, if you are able to get gold on all three of the adventure races in the Raceway, that's a very easy and quick 50\~ Bags a day, just FYI (would only take 5 minutes max.
---
iirc it hasnt been updated and doesnt cover expansion maps like tekkit's does
---
If anyone has been blindly trusting any of the preview rarity shown in game, then they've been doing it wrong.
---
There's a level of rarity hidden within the rarities shown on previews. This has been known for a while.
---
So, for instance:
---
If you are trying to get a specific super rare item, and you have 40% chance of getting a super rare, that's not the real chance.
---
To get a specific super rare item (if there are 5 super rare items) becomes 8%. However, this is actually much lower for the highly valued items, because they have a further rarity involved in acquiring them (which is not verifiable by us - as with all the ratios). Let's assume there's a 2% chance of acquiring your said item from the super rare selection.
---
That means, if there are 5 items in the super rare tab, instead of your chance of getting a specific very rare item being 8%, it now becomes 0.8%, while the chance of acquiring the other 4 changes from 8% to 9.8%.
---
TLDR: For those confused by math, don't trust the preview window - it lied, it lies, and it will continue to lie. You cannot determine the real rarity from the preview - only know what you can POTENTIALLY get.
---
I think the gem exchange is perfectly valid for cosmetics and lots of things where you know exactly what you're getting in the exchange.
---
I should clarify, the trick or treat bags are labeled and function exactly the same as black lion chests: items in a category don't all have the same drop rate but they're listed together. It's misleading at best but I don't think the halloweeen bags should get a free pass because gold is the most common payment. They're still loot bags, it's still gambling.
---
I don't know enough about ecto gambling or the other rng bags to comment on those.
---
That's a SUPER srs RIBA+Ct
---
I thought it was for Reddit Number Guarantee?  So you are telling me it is Random Number not Guarantee?
---
&gt; Have no desire to go back to anything I've played before. 
---
I mean, unless you like how the combat feels, GW2 is pretty much the same as any other MMO. Go into the Dungeon / Fractal / Raid and kill the boss for End-game group content. Dynamic events are the best feature of GW2 as far as casual PvE content is concerned. 
---
Warrior is an excellent class for solo roaming on the open world, also a must, for group content. (Don't play PvP or WvW but i imagine Warrior does well in those game modes as well) Here's a video:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeHK-pgJixo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeHK-pgJixo) 
---
Warrior is more of an offensive hybrid class, while you buff your party with banners your DPS can be very competitive with those of DPS oriented classes if both are played by equally skilled players.
---
If you buy the Path of Fire Expansion, you get both the base game and the Heart of Thorns expansions as well.  [https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807)  Apparently the game costs $20, it's a steal. For a new player that's at least 1000 hours worth of content, I myself have been playing on and off since release and have around 5.5k hours. Unless you are planing to be a hardcore World v world player, i wouldn't worry about which server you choose as far as PvE is concerned since all servers are merged into one.
---
Here are a couple of videos:

---
I hope you give the game a try!
---
I suspect they sub group loot table, the same they do with blc - you have two rolls for loot, one to determine what category of loot you get and another for what loot you get in that category - weapons' drop rate probably were diminished by introducing new box but left other items untouched.
---
Mobs drop bags rather than loot directly as a QoL feature to preserve bag space. It was heavily requested by players post-HoT.
---
I took my time to do the personal story.
---
Now PoF to catch up. I really want to get the skyscale mount.
---
Im not in a rush at all. But just wanted to have a better idea of how to gear up as eventually I might do it
---
I still play, but I'm not putting one more cent into the game and I've stopped caring about skins. I only do casual map events and WvW with my guildmates. WvW doesn't care about skins.
---
This has been a theory since season 2 maybe before that.
---
I'd be more fine with it, yes. I still wouldn't BUY them, but it's a bit less social engineering and that would be a step in the right direction.
---
Nice. I'll give it a go on my warrior. Hope it's fine
---
Nice and where can I look up this theory? Can you tell me about it?
---
&gt; decide whether you want to roll the dice yourself or sell your roll to another player.
---
I forgot that most lootbags aren't account bound... Oh wait! Guess "selling that dice roll" might be a tad hard when the majority of lootboxes you receive are account bound... Tell me, whta is the point of hiding [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Battered_Forged_Components) loot table behind an account bound box? Saving inventory space? When literally every part of it is immediatelly disposable from any location in the game?
---
&gt;it's so vague as to be practically useless.
---
It's pretty straight forward if you're not deliberatly obtuse about it :)
---
You would rather not know that the items are very rare at all, and just hear about it from other people? That would decrease information. Maybe a better way would be to be more precise with the odds rather than less...
---
&gt;  Any suggestions for a nice solo class with some suitability?
---
Open world is balanced around solo play, therefore all classes are fine.
---
If you ignore Kormir and remember that she took that job from Abbadon then the purple color theme between Abbadon and Kralkatorrik is a possible link. Though admittedly not as strong a one as the others.
---
Oh right, I forgot that "lootbags" didn't exist pre HoT and were introduced by popular demand.... Wait...
---
Mounting helps sometimes, it leaves the noisy glowy "residue" behind at the spot where you mounted, like a floaty blade of annoyance.
---
Grenth (who took his job from Dhuum) also was a death themed character
---
There's also the fact that Kormir/The Sunspears had a lot of drama going on in the same area as Kralkatorrik but the might also just be as luck would have it
---
It looks like [3 trinkets](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Firebrand_-_Quickness_Support_Power_DPS_(Fractal)) should be good, but if you struggle to maintain quickness you should add more pieces. (I've seen 23% boon duration bonus as the recommended amount to hit)  
---
I personally run 4 trinkets (back, amulet, ring and accessory) and any problems I have in maintaining quickness I can attribute to me needing to git gud at positioning and hitting the correct buttons. 🤷
---
Woodenpotatoes has a couple of videos on it. They are tied to season 2 cut scenes.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVpMJuqnT3Y&amp;list=PLrWbKox2xEYvmMigeyY4-rv2ZWXMkKsAt&amp;index=148&amp;t=0s.
---
[Warrior builds](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/warrior/warrior/banner/). Warrior is either dps or bs. BS means banner slave with the two offensive banners. The difference between both roles is basicly having banners or no banners.
---
The “fastest” way to get ascended is first do knight of the thorn. You get a choice of 1 ascended weapon. Dagger/greatsword and couple others. 
---
Second, get correct exotics gear for whichever class. find a training raid guild and plow down 1 and 4. Get mag even with raid wipes. 
---
3. Do fracs, get enough ar to do tier 2s. It’s not as often as t4s to get ascended drops but, you still have a possibility. 
---
4. Commendations (If) you build uses berserkers. You can get 2 ascended accessories for like 24 guild commendations altogether. 
---
So quickest way, knight of thorn. It’s a quest that’s like couple hours to do. Get guild commendations if your build needs berserkers. You will have 3 ascended pieces really quick. 
---
After that find a raid guild to train with. Even if you wipe you get mag. Save mag till you can buy weapon/armor. 
---
Get to t2 fractals. Farm dailies everyday. 
---
If you have living world season 3. Farm bitter frost. Then farm lake Doric for your amulet. Farm Draconis for your ring. 
---
There is also specialization ascended weapons. Do path of fire weapons since they are cheaper and much easier. 
---
If you still have dooky drop rate. Then you do crafting. 
---
Easy gear to acquire, berserkers, assassins. 
---
So dps classes are easy to acquire. Vipers are not as easy to acquire. Harriers are same thing. So (if) crafting is a must craft berserkers. If say you get a wrong stat drop DO NOT salvage. You can convert the stats in mystic forge. You can not change trinket stats. But armor and weapons can. 
---
Tech trinkets can be changed however it’s more complicated. 
---
Trinkets dropped from raids stats can change if you ether attune or infuse them. 
---
Trinkets from fractals can not be changed. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
&gt;Probably less, actually. People who farm bags know that they'll get a steady gold per hour by selling bags to high-rollers trying to get their rare drops. 
---
Oh wait, so you're telling me players sell lootbags to people who wanna gamble for good loot? Man, if only there was a word to describe such a mechanic, that would be swell.
---
yesm both are underwhelming in general
---
Warrior builds. Warrior is either condi dps, power dps, condi bs or power bs. This build is power bs. BS means banner slave with the two offensive banners. The difference between both roles is basicly having banners or no banners. Spam f1 like there is no tomrrow and go with double mace in the second weapon set for big cc.
---
&gt; Abbadon 
---
ABBA (Swedish pronunciation: [²abːa]) are a Swedish pop group formed in Stockholm in 1972 by Agnetha Fältskog, Björn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson, and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. The group's name is an acronym of the first letters of their first names. They became one of the most commercially successful acts in the history of popular music, topping the charts worldwide from 1974 to 1982. ABBA won the Eurovision Song Contest 1974 at The Dome in Brighton, UK, giving Sweden its first triumph in the contest. They are the most successful group to have taken part in the competition.
---
Kralkatorrik's domain really Bugs Me because it feels like the other dragons have natural inverses, you know?
---
Ice and Fire, Plant (Life) and Death which leaves just.... Crystal and Water
---
Now, Mordremoth also having MIND as one of his big domains is interesting because it leads me to believe that maybe they all had TWO domains: one very elemental and one more personable.
---
I've seen in the comments for the Icebrood Saga's trailer a point that Jormag is much more emotionally and psychologically Manipulative than even Mordremoth, who just bluntly overwhelms the sylvari until they give in, so maybe we can for the sake of argument assume that Jormag is not only Ice but Emotion as well.
---
Thanks! I'll check these out!
---
There is honestly not much you need to sell on the TP. All gear you get can be (and should be) salvaged for materials which is the bulk of the stuff, use a basic salvage kit.  Materials can be deposited straight from your bag via the gear in the top right (deposit all) that goes straight into your bank. The gear you get from level up and as random drops is absolutely fine until you reach level 80.
---
Well they are naturally linked in that they use magic, but it doesn't really go further than that. Trying to match the gods to the dragons always falls apart because the gods weren't limited to using only one "basic" form, and their domains are often more about their position as objects of worship (there doesn't seem to be any such thing as "truth magic" for example).
---
If two people at a bar order the same drink, there isn't a link between them, they just happened to drink the same thing.
---
It had never been in the game beforehand (just "AOE loot on interact," which is a good "free" version).  When they added it to WvW, they added it as part of the WvW mastery tracks, so they just did the same thing when it came to PvE.  Partly it may be that they needed to pad out the central tyria masteries, idk.
---
If you don't have it yet, just turn on "AoE loot on interact" in the options and compulsively press "F" or whatever your bind is.
---
We are essentially arguing about the motivation of ArenaNet using lootboxes as the primary loot source. You seem to think they had pure and 100% good intention, I disagree and think this was a pretty standard business decision. No point arguing about things we can't proof, so we're gonna agree to disagree.
---
What in the absolute fuck?! The drop rate for many of these items have been nerfed SO much from previous years. I'm not seeing how this is 'good for the health of the game', ANet. This just sucks. 💩
---
Grenth is also the God of Ice, so the correlation is already broken. Mordremoth was also the Elder Dragon of the Mind, which is sort of Lyssa's thing. 
---
I think it is more of a coincidence or a repetition of tropes more than anything. Or it will be another mystery that will be dragged out for decades before it is given a disappointing or retconned conclusion.
---
I'm only arguing that people requested it. A lot. And it is objectively beneficial. If you believe there are also nefarious purposes, that's weird but fine.
---
Thank you very much! Need to try that class and this option is with minor changes in my current equipment. Ill get four pieces as well, better safe than sorry. :) cheers!
---
I don't think there is a link, but remember that the Human gods aren't native to Tyria while the dragons are.  The gods might very well have been the dragons of their world, forced to leave by that world's version of the PC.
---
&gt; But they are loot boxes, you can buy them with real money and the drop odds are very misrepresented on the "preview".
---
Right there in the first comment, my definition of loot box. I'm very open to discussion on other peoples' definition, but I laid out my own immediately and clearly and it's not "any box with loot in it".
---
It's easily fractals. Starting with attuned and infused rings you can get 54 AR easily. Just comes down to winterberry farming or any of the ls3 maps. Blood rubies being second best imo. Along with guild commendations if your build happens to be core stats. Trinkets provide the most stats and will get you to a grand total of 91 AR, not including infusing the backpack, which is expensive. Along with doing the fractal dailies you'll slowly get the money needed to craft the armor pieces.
---
Thanks!  I always thought proc meant Procreation and wondered why all these Christian game developers were making RPGs (IIRC, this means Random Piety Generators)!
---
Although I am old now, almost 30, so I can't keep up with the millennial terms.  Heck, I remember back in the day when games use to come on CDs!  Back in my time, we use to have to use 7 or 8 disks to install Call of Duty and couldn't just download it on day 1 (lucky if the local game store even had the game - they only cared the popular titles like Pacman).
---
Sorry, where is the study that shows there is a difference between enemy-&gt;loot and enemy-&gt;bag-&gt;loot? Which bags do you think are lootboxes, anyway, what's your criteria? What's the difference between one more enemy and one more bag?
---
nah, it's super easy with a raptor
---
Because if it wasnt mastery it would be monetized like build templates.
---
I mean yea? Being commander gives you no excuse to be slow
---
The problem with teapots mindset is, it's contradicting. His saying its easy and still the first one expecting it to be harder and better, well harder is better for games. But making that would just go back to being a raid. And making players be picky to not pick brain dead people. Which will revert us back to raid mentality. I play strike mission 1 handed and really tell every player how fcking boring and easy it was just so some players realize we just stand there pressing 1 button.....
---
The problem I find on GW2 raid is the KP system.... You have 250 LI you raid alot. Alright join, you have 100 or 20 LI? Well fck off... If Anet can somehow fix that players cant judge each other just by having this KP abit of GW2 raid would be alive... We Need a healer or dps. That's my role. Before you can join you see a Fcking 100 LI requirement or 250 Kill Proof, well fck...
---
TL;DR : Kill Proof System By Players is what killed Raiding for GW2, if anet didn't have loots for players to count and judge them on Kill Proof, everyone would be willing to try out each other rather than judging just because you only have 1 LI or you don't have Title (lnhb example)
---
Trigger me already when teapot contradicts himself with, " its just the start and it will get better"... A better game (specially raiding) would be a hard game. Which will revert us back to raid mentality. I would have prefer if strike mission was hard, since there's no KP for players to use on this boss I would have loved to see what could have happened.
---
You could try the Worldmap. Minimap works as well, but has a smaller UI
---
You thinking that you can just have the gear swapped from one toon to the other with a click of a button? For free nonetheless?!? Bruh, that will be 2600 gems, thanks.
---
I don't have a great deal of knowledge of the game's inner workings. I was just thinking that since the skins are Charr only then maybe they don't drop for non-Charr characters like how you can't buy the race specific armor unless you're of that race.
---
Again, I don't know how the game works so I was just curious if that was a possibility.
---
I'd do HoT first.
---
For the goal of obtaining an ascended weapon through elite specializations, there's no reason to jump to PoF. All you need is Hero Points and there are plenty of squads doing HP runs in HoT maps.
---
If you do skip, a) the story will make a lot less sense (if any) and be completely spoiled for you, b) you might be eaten alive by mobs, which I found significantly harder in PoF (and more numerous, with more easily triggered aggro mechanics).
---
Finally, rushing usually leads to fatigue.
---
&gt; I'm going to solo, a lot. Any suggestions for a nice solo class with some suitability? I'm guessing warrior?
---
Warriors can be nice for beginners because their class mechanic is simple and they have access to a lot of different weapons, but I personally didn't find it that survivable running solo (compared to other classes). Necromancer is a great choice for solo play because you can select minion skills and basically have a meat shield made of minions, making it hard to be killed (plus the class mechanic gives you an extra health bar). Ranger is also very good solo. You have a pet which can keep enemies busy, and does a decent amount of damage (can help make up for lack of experience at the beginning). I've also found Revenant to be surprisingly durable, though nothing in particular stands out as to why. 
---
&gt; Which classes lend themselves to pve grouping? I'm also interested in a healing/buffing class for just this reason alone.
---
All classes have viable builds, so don't feel like you have to stick to "approved" classes. Some people that only want "the best" (more accurately, what they heard is the best) may not like some classes, but that's not worth thinking about (it changes as balance patches come anyway). It's very easy to run lots of alternate characters, so don't feel like you'll be locked into one play-style by your choice at the beginning. Out of the classes I mentioned earlier, Druid (Ranger elite spec) and Renegade (Revenant elite spec) can both play more supportive roles in group content. 
---
&gt; Haven't bought the game but it looks like I need to buy the Path of Fire Xpac. 
---
The base game is free to play, with only minor restrictions (typically based around combating bots), so give that a try before you buy anything. You now get both expansions when you buy PoF, so it's worth getting if you're going to spend some time playing. If you enjoy the game, the current price is a steal. Among many other things, it's worth noting that you get 3 extra character slots (5 total) and 2 max level boosts, so if you're worries about having 'good' classes later on, that'll give you easy options. I strongly recommend not using max level boosts on your first character though, as levelling is like an extended tutorial; if you skip it, you might find you have trouble with game mechanics and how the class plays. 
---
&gt; Any servers that have a better population than others? (I admit I have no idea how servers are broken up)
---
The servers you see at the beginning are just for World v World, which is basically a massive PvP map where your team is your entire server. You get one free server swap anyway, so I wouldn't worry about this now. The only restriction for open world is between NA and EU (and China, but they're completely isolated and don't even share a trading post). You'll be placed on whatever appropriate instance is available each time you join a map, so you're always going to see other players. In fact, if a map instance gets too empty, it'll shut down and move the remaining players to other instances (you get a 1h warning and can switch whenever you want). You can also join other instances by joining a group. For the big, map-wide meta events, people will put groups in the LFG tool. You simply join the group, then you can right click on a player in your group and join their instance. 
---
&gt; Any good youtube videos out there breaking down class builds/strats?
---
You can use [Metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) and [Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/) to find builds. For open world stuff, just use it as a rough guide, and feel free to experiment while levelling. While these are typically good builds, you can have fun with things they don't list. There's also the [Wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Main_Page) which is very useful for learning about the game in general. There's also [this website](https://gw2crafts.net/) which makes it very easy to level crafting disciplines.
---
Get over it man.
---
And so we get things like Death-Branded minions and stuff? What are the applications of that in game?
---
Oh I mean in the context of a condi firebrand in a raid, there's no real reason to pop the last charge of the mantra.
---
by being mastery it's monetized by default
---
Ahh my bad. I always forget firebrand has a use outside of healbot in wvw because thats all I use jt for XD
---
You also have lyssa tied pretty strongly to zhaitan.  In Orr we see lyssa was tied pretty heavily to the funerary rites.  And we have been told zhaitan was death and shadow.  Shadow could be connected to illusions as a possible way to interpret that aspect.
---
Wow I didn't know that the gift of the moon was that rare, to think I could've gotten an infusion :(
---
*gigglefits*
---
&lt;3
---
I haven't played WvW Firebrand but I've played it in PvP, and yes I would definitely pop my mantras if I needed it, even if it was the last charge.
---
I think I used up all of my luck this year since I got a Phospholuminescent Infusion and 2 red Reverberating Infusions in just under 2000 bags. Didn't expect them to be THAT rare damn.
---
We saw it under the death and vine touched enemies.  We saw it in the build up in krallkatorrik that manifested as the beings the energy came from.  
---
It strikes me as the greatest danger in killing largely powerful magical beings is the unfiltered energies it introduces into the ley lines more than the massive energy explosion. 
---
Think of it like a nuclear blast.  Yeah the explosion is bad but the fallout that gets in the ground water is harsher.  Instead of ground water in this case we have ley lines
---
Oh Shoot was that Lyssa? That's actually really cool I didn't know that lol
---
What could be interesting is some sort of...passaround system, maybe, since a lot of dragons have multiple aspects, as do the gods.
---
Someone mentioned earlier that Grenth is both Death and Ice related, so he could have ties to Jormag and Zhaitan maybe, where Lyssa is Illusion (shadow) and Water for Zhaitan and Zelbbub, ect
---
I wonder whether the Spirits of the Wild would be able to tap into the leylines at all.... we don't see any Vine-Touched Spirits, but we also don't really focus on the Norn for the whole of HoT and PoF for the most part

Still a POS tho
---
Haha yeah. Blame BG for being the only server that tries to win every week. Don't blame the servers that are constantly tanking and causing unbalanced matchups at every level.
---
Guys, how much time do you spend on the character selection screen to even complain about it ? I really don't get it...
---
I don't know, you might be right. But why are are Exotic drops much lower than what they were before, then?
---
Was flooded with them, used to fill bank tabs every week before selling or throwing into the mystic forge. Now barely get any anymore.
---
Yes. They are worthless. They always have been worthless.

Salvage is is still worth the same, you just don't "progress" anymore.

Last year, when Halloween started, ive been playing my new necro. Been lvl~45. Went in the Lab and in like couple of hours I've been lv80. Got some money (thanks to the ToT bags) and fresh lv80 character. Then ive been farming Lab with staff necro till the end of the event. Had fun, got fast to lv80 and got rich, hehe.
---
You can donate your luck to Guild halls to buy lanterns for the lunar New year.
---
Unless you're weaver staff.... **j/k**!!!!
---
In year and a half ive been playing Necro, Warrior and Guardian. All of them can do endgame content with core builds. And probably rest of the classes as well.
---
That range alone is reason enough since there's bots using rangers with longbows to tag in large areas. Even with AoE loot on interact, the character still has to walk close enough to interact with some things.
---
Welcome to the game, here's hoping you enjoy it! All the classes in GW2 are designed to operate independently, and solo/informal group play makes up a lot of the content, so it's really more a question of what playstyle you enjoy - Ranger involves a lot of pet management, for example, and Elementalist centers around shifting between four elemental attunements. I would recommend looking up the various classes and seeing what looks interesting to you, although if you can tell me what you enjoyed playing in WoW I might be able to point you in the right direction.
---
Similarly, pretty much every class is viable in late-game content in some way or other, although for healing or buffing you'll probably want to look into things like Ranger, Mesmer, Revenant, and Guardian. I should warn you, however, that Raids aren't a huge part of the game compared to an MMO like WoW so they don't get nearly as much developer support, and they require thinking and playing in a very different way from the rest of the game. That's not to say you shouldn't try them if they look interesting, just be prepared to adapt.
---
Servers aren't really a *thing*, as the game uses a megaserver system to manage player distribution and such. Worlds only matter for World versus World PvP, and that system is currently in the process of being redesigned, so they might not matter at all before too long. You can play with anyone in the same region regardless of World, so just pick whatever speaks to you. I can't really think of any good YouTube stuff for builds and such, but in my opinion it's better to figure that stuff out for yourself unless you're either having a lot of trouble or trying to go really hardcore into the high-level content. Check out the wiki to see what class looks appealing then experiment with various weapons and skills to find out what works for you - it shouldn't be too difficult for an MMO veteran to figure out. That said, if you have any questions or want a hand with anything feel free to drop me a line.

Chinese reddit bots downvoting this thread I see.

You can sell them on trading post. I don't know the prices of those specific ones, but better to sell them than to keep them, as you already have one in acc wardrobe.

The priory has a book debunking the notion.

People still do them. Not like before, but you can find a group quite easily, except for Arah. If you passed by in the last two days and there is no people, that can be cos of Halloween event. As big majority of the player base is in Lab now.
---
You know, when I first started playing Path of Fire I was triggered so hard because of the oppression of the Elonians by Joko.  It reminded me of a time when the United States had slavery.  The fact that Zafirah was essentially a slave who used her gun for her corporate overlords made me realize how little love people have for Elonians and those like them.  Like they're not supposed to feel but just work.  Constantly oppressed.  
---
I eventually resigned myself to never completing Path of Fire because of all the racist undertones.  Now I just hang out in the Maguuma Jungle with the Itzel tribes.  Jungle tribes don't trigger me as much because they don't look like my friends.
---
This is definitely what I thought too, but figured I would ask as well. From my understanding (or assumption) China or Tencent or what-have-you has much less interest and ability to invest in South Korean and Japanese companies than in American or European ones.
---
I thought I was just curiously asking something I myself didn't fully know. :/ But people screaming in anger about anything China/controversy related were definitely the first to hit this post.
---
Shadow magic is used to create invisibility effects like Stealth and Hide in Shadows (mesmer version of stealth), clones, and disguises. Effects that bypass enemy defenses and effects that allow teleporting through a 'void' and moving faster than light like Shadowsteps often use shadow magic too. 
---
Mesmers and thieves are the ones that use Shadow Magic the most.
---
I would have expected more super rares than that for 100k bags. The RNG in this game still amazes me how punishing it is to the playerbase. What would it harm if more people had those infusions, honestly??
---
Locking quality of life conveniences behind masteries is used to give a sense of progression is my understanding. Something to work towards.
---
Eh, about half of my account value is gem store items (and most of those purchases are via gold) so trading something that can be used to buy gem store items for a pittance of gold seems like madness to me. An infinite gathering tool is 1000 gems, or 370g, or 45 statuettes. 45 statuettes at 2.5g each is 112g.
---
One thing to consider is that Kormir is a replacement deity for Abbadon, so it’s likely that Kormir doesnt have a dragon. Abbadon seems like a good match for Bubbles with how mysterious they both are, but we already have water Lyssa.

Dont design useless currency. Thats all. I only play with people who maxed out mf with luck. This people want a use for luck. When you do not need it, why even take part in the discussion?
---
Craft your 1st set, make sure it is a class wanted/needed and can be used for both CMs+t4 fractals and raids, as this 2 areas of PvE give a good amount of ascended to craft your next couple of armor sets. Also doing ranked pvp during seasons is slow but decent pace to work on ascended gear. Some achievements give gear too, but u need more info on that. And lastly as you mentioned are the specialization collections.
---
Well ASIDE from that, GEEZ. ;)
---
The exact reason why I don't really log onto the game anymore. Anything new comes in the game, it comes in two forms: it's behind a huge and unreasonable grind wall/drops from lootboxes or it's in the fucking gemstore. There is no middle ground anymore.
---
No not warrior for soloing, try necromancer or ranger or mesmer.
---
Not gonna lie I thought the shadow was Crash Bandicoot for a sec (yes I know what it is) looks like two ears his hair some floating eyebrows from his eyes but his arms seemed a little....low poly.

Path of Fire is easier so use the maps to unlock your elite spec of choice then go to heart of thorns.
---
No, the Bloody Prince isn’t in this year’s festival.
---
They are worthless because they are simply useless. OP opened 100,000 bags, that is equivalent to around 5000gold,  or over100 hours of farning lab (if you get 1k bags/h which rarely happens). If you think that spending 100 hours is not enought to get an item, you should leave the fucking basement, and start looking at things from perspective of people who're not spensing half of their lives in the game. 
---
Anet is going overboard with the abysmall drop rates of some items, while putting most great looking skins in the shop.
---
all hail mr.popo
---
I just hoard Skirmish Chests because I'm too lazy to decide what to choose from them, everything else is opened on the go including unid gear.
---
And it really feels like I drop less than half of the exotics, that's why I assumed some loot was replaced too to reduce magic find effects.
---
Season 2 is shit from a story telling and gameplay perspective tho. Play it if you need the mastery points and keep in mind you can gold2 gems. Playing one episode and selling everything you get will help finance the next episode. 
---
Play pof befor hot. Hot was intended for veterans with years of experience and has  a certain expectation of player skill/ game knowledge.

Humans and human Gods come from another planet. Human gods are that planet's 'dragons', and humans are their collective 'minions'.
---
Humans and human gods came to Tyria in search of further lands and magic because the human Gods consumed all magic from their planet and brought it to ruin.
---
&gt; ...You do realize that if the bags were removed and the loot would just be distributed the same way without the bags, the amount of overall items would remain 100% unchanged?
---
I'm going to have to play the "to be fair" card here and point out that ToT bags and similar monster loot bags are more than likely about coding convenience and fast adjustments, rather than a sinister ploy to cause a dopamine rush.    
---
The lootbag-&gt;gambling effect might still be a thing, *especially* when super-rare items are hidden in them, but that's when you blame calculated drop rates, not the delivery system.
---
Sell now they been around the same price for a while now
---
Like i've been saying.. This games loot system sucks. 
---
It's lottery wars 2, and it prays on people that are addicted to gambling.
---
Just wait till it's up on around 1800-2000 gold, if you got the condition one. Regardless of the infusion, over 1800g.
---
&gt; proc, which comes from programmed random occurrence
---
...I've been using this term since I played WoW years ago. Never learned its origin until now. Thanks!
---
What purpose would those controls serve? 
---
The only people who could realistically open enough bags where they should be "guaranteed" one of these drops by a "fair" RNG system are the ones buying absolutely insane quantities, like OP. It's not a use case that most people are going to run into. You say they're "pretty much counting on thousands of players generating thousands of bags"....yeah, they're absolutely counting on that, why wouldn't they? It's very consistent, and I'm certain that the number of bags generated every Halloween is well into the millions. If they want to keep certain items relatively rare (only a few hundred or thousand on the TP), then they 
---
Let's just assume for a second that there are, at any one time, 1000 people farming in the Lab on average. That obviously isn't a constant, but let's just say for average. Let's also say that they're not all farming at optimal capacity, so they generate just about a stack per hour per person. That's already 250,000 bags generated in one hour. Over the course of two weeks, that means that roughly 84 million bags will be generated, conservatively. If they want an item to only drop 1000 times over the entire event, that means it needs a droprate of 0.0012%. With such a drop rate, you only have a 70% chance of dropping a particular item when opening 100k bags. You'd need to open 59k bags to have a greater 50% chance of dropping that item. 
---
So the question is, should ANet bother to put a control in place to make it so that you definitely will drop an item after opening 50k bags? 100k? What probability is a good enough "sure thing" where they can balance the rarity and still give people opening this many bags their proper reward...and more importantly, does it matter? What percentage of the population is opening 50k bags or more? Is it a worthwhile use of their time to put such a control in place that will literally only ever be felt by a tiny fraction of the game's population?
---
Condi Mirage is fantastic in open world, your main limitation is against structures in core Tyria that are immune to condi. Fully geared, get close to perma-evasion and strong enough to solo PoF bounties. You rely a lot on mirage cloaks and ambushes (and endurance regen for mirage cloaks). Unless you’re up against a champion, you can pretty much ignore your shatters.

Ideal is Axe/Torch + Staff in full Trailblazer weapons, armor, and trinkets:

* Can switch to Staff + Staff for button-mashing laziness

* Can save money by starting with Dire gear then slowly upgrading to Trailblazer

* Switch out to Viper gear for Fractals and Raids

Keep in mind that you can get gems from gold, too. 200 gems (one episode) would cost you about 74 gold right now.
---
Now, obviously as a newcomer you don't have a lot of gold just lying around. But you will save up some stuff, especially if you get into PvP or into dungeons/fractals. You should be able to buy at least some of those episodes through gold instead of cash. (Though you shouldn't actually buy the episodes individually if you can help it, you'll save some gems when you buy the bundles.)

Thank ya

Gacha boxes are a scam, episode 187659081
---
I had a few bags from last year and bought a few more this year to complete the 1,000 needed on the annual achievement and I can confirm on a 10/100 scale the drop rates are indeed utterly garbage aswell. 
---
Surely not 100k bags but 1k is still quite a number for the casual player.
---
The majority of loot was the common tonics and foods with an overly abundance of CC enough for 3-5 candy corn cobs. 
---
At the rate 2 days ago 1000 bags cost me a whopping 60-65g this was no easy feat as “cheap” availability sold quickly so other people had the same idea. 
---
If you have the gold to spend I guess if you want try and be extremely lucky to hoot its really not worth it. 
---
The infusions at least the cheap ones are usually quite affordable after a while with the exception of the seasonal ones.
---
&gt; worst casenis that It would have been unlocked anyway if I would have put it in the forge
---
No. Minis are _only_ unlocked in the wardrobe by consuming them. Using them in the mystic forge would not have unlocked the mini.
---
&gt; What purpose would those controls serve? 
---
1. Player wants shiny.
---
2. Shiny costs 10k currency.
---
3. Player swipes credit card.

4. ????

5. PROFIT!

consistent inconsistency
---
Wow this looks really good! I'd love to see it lit in the dark :D
---
I appreciate your response.
---
I think that your question needs to be asked and that the Durmand Priory book has made any further progress in the formulation of an answer to it extremely difficult for the player base to make. Most players just dismiss any connection between the gods and the Elder Dragons because, well, it's *unpopular* to associate them.
---
People will point out to you that the gods don't perfectly match the Elders, or that even the gods themselves don't seem to have clear spheres of influence (Lyssa and Abaddon both hold sway over time, as per *The Six.* Lyssa appears to control the *present* and the *future*, whereas Abaddon controls the *past)*. I believe that this is intentional - development wants some of these things to be *blurry.* Evenso, we can see some things clearer than others. It's easy to associate Balthazar with Primordus, and Balthazar's actions in LS4  - sending Primordus back to sleep using Omadd's Machine - indicate that Balthazar *identifies* with Primordus somehow. So there's something to ponder.
---
Then there is the correlation between Melandru and Mordremoth; the correlation between Grenth and Zaithan, (which, I believe, the Original Story is *designed* to help us see); and the obvious correlation between "Bubbles" and Abaddon. These connections are easier to discern than, say, those between Dwayna and the Elders, Lyssa and the Elders, or Kormir and the Elders.
---
One of the reasons some of these gods may be harder to match to Elder Dragons and vice versa is that they are often *combinations* of the six elements. Kormir is yellow. Mordremoth is *green-yellow.* Why isn't there a *perfect* correlation between these two entities? After all, it doesn't matter whether the two are one and the same. What matters if whether we see color wheels that correspond to each other...and we don't.
---
The question is *why???*
---
tyvm mate
---
yeah I was LITERALLY SHAKING when I entered path of fire zones because I too fabricate things in my mind I almost killed myself bruh tru story I feel ya.
---
Love this attitude but I don’t play ranked anymore (just AT/mAT as PvP for me these days) but man pvp scene needs more people with thick skin and positive attitude overall.
---
Take an upvote
---
You can’t be elitist with 0 karma sorry
---
&gt; Crafting is the fastest and most direct, but it's more expensive.
---
Once you are at the required crafting prof level, it is only 2-3 hours in whatever gold farm is popular, to craft a piece of ascended. That is about as easy as it gets in any mmorpg to get the best stat gear.
---
Hearts are quests in my eyes. Horizontal progression only takes you so far, you need vertical progression for end-game content to continue to be added into the game. 
---
Every MMO has pretty much the same classes GW2 does including how elites work, at least trinity is not actually forced on all raid encounters and different classes can cover multiple roles, but this is part of the combat system. 
---
I agree that exploration in this game is top notch, i remember the first time  i found Goemm's Lab. Man, what an experience! 
---
Don't get me wrong, reason i play GW2 over any other MMO is because of how it differs from the rest, but at their core, every MMO is pretty much the same.
