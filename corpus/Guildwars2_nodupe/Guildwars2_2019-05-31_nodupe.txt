the slam attack after swipe doesn't need to be dodged, enough to stay right inside the hitbox. don't waste ressources.
---
---
---
IMO GW2's drop rates should be adjusted. 
---

---
A lot of games these days include pity timers, time GW2 got with the times.
---
And a 1000 coffers is still way to many.
---
Gifting (legit) codes is allowed. You get a code which is "unlinked" from any personal data until you redeem it on your account.
---
I mean, it's a pretty common "trick".
---
Appreciate it. I'll check it out. And for Thunderhead, the rift I've been directed to is at the bottom of the waterfalls. Any idea if that's the correct one also?
---
Essentially you have a dataset of one. It happened one time to you. I wouldn't draw any conclusions from that evidence.
---
It isn't uncommon for people to link stuff using wiki codes, which means they didn't get it. Some people will assume you're doing that. 
---
In my years of playing, and I play a lot, I never saw anyone actually get mad at it. I have seen people accuse others of not actually getting the drop.
---
Think about it. Anyone can link a code from the wiki. Sure you'll get some congratulations, but really, there's no good way to tell that you actually got the drop, and some people are jaded.
---
In a game with this many players, there's bound to be some assholes anyway. Just block them if they really offend you, or ignore them and move on.
---
Over all I've met far more good players than asshats. But asshats are often louder.
---
It's north east of the POI that goes into a cave and upwards
---
i'm kinda looking forward to it, good reason to stop using the site
---
Meanwhile I'm still waiting for the fucking preview to allow showing two weapons at once.
---
&gt; Do you think that will take the fun out of the game by avoiding the grind?
---
That depends on what you find fun.  If it were me, I would use an 80 booster and get on the new map straight away to start the skyscale mount collection.  You're a vet, so I trust you can familiarize yourself with the new class at 80, instead of a noob that needs to get a handle on the game basics on top of the a new class, so they benefit from the long leveling journey.

&gt; **Bug Fixes:**
---
&gt;
---
&gt;* Fixed a bug that allowed Crystal Oasis: Hero's Choice Chests to drop more than once per day.
---
&gt;* Fixed a bug that caused some attribute-selectable trinkets to have improper attribute values.

---
I would say that T4's usually are easier than lower tiers as players generally run certain compositions that make those higher level fractals easier. Running with a support for boons and heals makes a lot of difference. A good support can easily carry a party. A good dps build and enough AR is obviously a must and if you want to know more about the mechanics of certain fractals without feeling like a deadweight I would recommend to check [discretize.eu](https://discretize.eu) for some more in depth mechanics.
---
did they post somethink like spikes in /s ;) that would be totaly normal
---
I got one on my first ever meta, will I get a second one at 1000 chests, or is the chest once per account?
---
Slightly related note but I do have a [quick recap on the season 1](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Story_Recap) story if you're interested (links to more detailed articles in there as well as the 3 hr "movie")
---
Using the mystic forge isn't crafting. You don't need a crafting profession, you don't get crafting xp, crafting boosters do nothing, etc. 
---
&gt;But then they go on to say, "There are a few items that were missed in the reset and will be reset in an upcoming hotfix. Sorry about that!" So I kind of still don't know what's going on and what will actually be reset.
---
So hopefully it'll be fixed soon, but [it wasn't the update that released just now.](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/937714/#Comment_937714) None of my stuff got fixed, so they didn't miss the patch notes either.
---
Not sure if bug or not, but the bounty board in the snowy part of Desert Highlands is completely blank now. I was waiting for Ellutherius Wintergust.
---
I've not been able to complete the meta even once; I keep crashing near the end.
---
Didn’t even know these existed. More reason to hang out in Dragonfall.
---
you need 25 metas for the achievement anyway, which already puts you at up to 900 coffers. in perspective it's quite reasonable for a guaranteed ascended weapon besides the tons of loot you get anyway. would have been better if that counter wasn't just a 1/account kinda deal though, imo.
---
&gt;Not entirely relying on RNG for once.
---
Can you name an example other than the Sunless weapons where this is the case?
---
F
---
 Elementalist
---
While true in general, that shouldn't be a concern on wyverns specifically. All of their attacks can be pointed away from the stack without needing to distort/block attacks, and indeed you won't have _enough_ distorts/blocks if you're planning on standing still through all of the wyvern's hits.
---
Next step is to go to volatile magic vendor and purchase it for 80 silver.
---
Elementalist would probably be what you are looking for.
---
* uses elements like your ele shaman
---
* most builds focus on fire and lightning like your ele shaman
---
* "fresh air" builds have similar "proc-based" gameplay and fast-paced casting as your ele shaman
---
* can easily change build and gear on the fly to become a sword weaver (enhancement shaman) or a heal tempest (resto shaman)
---
Honestly the best idea out there and it should be being worked on already it's going to be one of the only ways to save this game from dying.
---
Elementalists get Weaver elite spec, which gets Sword as a weapon and is basically a melee caster, reminiscent of Elemental Shaman if my memory serves right :)
---
I have done this.
---
I have also Glyph of Tides'd seekers while in CA. 
---
Don't be like me.
---
i used to solo ravenheart gloom with just heroes, made bank on that :)
---
It's a bug that's been in since the worst fears story steps were added back into the game. Happens when running them solo too, the story missions sometimes progress to the wrong story path.
---
Elemental shaman is a long-range lightning caster that gets random procs that reset their cooldown of their big nuke, and also random procs that shoot extra lightning bolts.
---
It's basically Fresh Air scepter tempest.
---
Ty a lot
---
Triple Trouble too I believe.
---
Wow! That's amazing!
---
Unrelated to this specific issue, but can you please look into the event "Defend Akili while he recalibrates mirrors around the Astralarium" in Domain of Istan?
---
Between the first and secon mirror, Akili constantly loops running forward, getting knocked back at exactly the same place and teleporting back.
---
This event is very important because it is necessary for the BRandstone Research achievement, which is necessary for the Astral weapons, which are necessary for the Vision I: Awakening collection.
---
Whatever blocks Akili's path is a solid invisible object, for some reason even giving a "gather" prompt but only while mounted on a Skimmer.
---
I gotcha. Ele shamans were very exciting to play, for me at least. That's what I'm looking for here
---
Sounds like you always have a very low chance but if you’ve gotten unlucky the 1000th chest is guaranteed to contain one. You would not get another one guaranteed since you already got one.
---
Didn't donvote you but I'd guess it has to do with that being a poor mentality. Who cares if someone is lying and you say grats? People do care if they're serious and you berate them. So why not just assume everyone isn't a troll and if they are who gives a f.
---
You should make a necro and ele and bring them into PvP to see their skills. It’ll boost you to 80.
---
Good thing you don't need it, then.
---
How do you.. Not dodge but. That's like the most important thing against champions 😂
---
Do events to get keys
---
Follow commander to do meta on kralkatorric
---
Then follow him to getcley line bosses
---
Yeah where possible the toughest champs in the game. Solo bounties. That stupid chak in HoT if you try to take it on without the mastery that reduces its poison dmg
---
The elemental thing in Lake Doric etc. Hard hero points like Balthazars rest etc.
---
Just picture the most difficult champion mobs.. Then tell us how'd you solo them.
---
Your username is active understanding but sadly you have no understanding of how to effectivly play reaper.
---
It's not so much about not dodging as dodging only when you have to (as in not spam it) - you've got plenty of vigor from Kalla to fill up one bar back quickly.
---
You mean currency for skyscale and currency for the new legendary trinket?!
---
What signals virtue in this post?
---
Yes, it IS a nice skin! :D
---
You're the one trying to make it political.
---
You're able to buy stat selectable backpacks from the Trading Post.
---
As far as armor, trinkets, and weapons, you may as well buy or craft based on whatever stats you need for your build.  Once you select the stats on an exotic piece, you cannot change them.
---
Its not that new, but yes, most likely for sigils and runes.
---
People do it all the time. The only people who don't do it, are people who are new to endgame and don't have the sets.
---
It's pretty expected that warrior knows how to core BS, power berserker BS, and Condi Berserker BS. We get a free meta pass for every single fight in the game, and the three builds are fairly easy to do decent enough on. If all you know is just core BS, then there's no point in keeping you. Effectively every other warrior looking for your spot will have all three meta builds ready to go.
---
It's not exactly expected that a Mirage will know power Chrono, but it is expected that you switch to a power class when you are doing an objectively power fight. Vice versa for condi.
---
They kinda look like...result of an unholy experiment of genetically crossing an Asura with a Sylvari.
---
Just started playing through Heart of Thorns story for the first time since it was released and granted my memory is terrible but I would swear they've changed it...? When did that happen and why?
---
Ok, but time gating neither adds nor reduces effort, it just adds waiting. Again, no more or less effort due to timegates, just downtime.
---
I'm not saying change the requirements, I'm just saying reduce the time gates. Yes, legendaries should require work, no I'm not crying over that. I'm just saying that there should be more active effort and less waiting.
---
Ok? Can we agree on that? That its ok for it to require work but not arbitrary waiting?
---
&gt; After opening 100 chests, you will no longer continue to get the rare items and a different effect will play to demonstrate that you hit the limit. This daily limit has been in place since the map shipped.
---
So to be clear, the map guarentees 100 rares daily from chests?
---
&gt; Zhaitan and Mordemoth hadn’t consumed any others magic at the time.
---
In Guild Chat they revealed that Kralk got mad from magic eons ago. It didn't happen in the near past. So all other Elder Dragons had the same condition until we killed Zhaitan.
---
Since you're speaking officially as a moderator about this, you can show exactly where the hate in their posts is, right?
---
You're barely dpsing for the 5 seconds you're locked into mace autos, as well.  If SB was higher DPS it would be well worth it to spend 2 seconds CCing with consumables rather be stuck in mace set, but it's not.
---
Since this reward structure is quite different to what we have seen in the past, it would be nice, if you could elaborate a bit on it from a designer perspective. For example why you chose this structure and you think are the advantages over old reward structures that gave similar rewards.
---
Basically, what was the reason why you implemented this reward structure and what do you hope to improve with it?
---
On a personal note, I would like to say that I am quite a big fan of your work. I tihnk I started following it after the major reworks of Halloween Bags and Wintersday Gifts in 2017 (?). I think especially the WD Gift overhaul was a great update to festival rewards, even though it will probably take a couple of more years to get rid of the oversupply from previous years and take full effect.
---
Are reward systems a major focus of your workload or what else are you working on?
---
TRIAL BY STONE!!!!
---
Congrats on the precursor drop!  And condolences for immediately finding out how divisive they can be.
---
Well, the god themed backpieces (Light of Dwayna, Bough of Melandru, and Chaos of Lyssa) that I mentioned are ascended and you do craft those. Those were the ones I didn't expect to be reset, and indeed the one I have was not.
---
You're right about the update though. Nothing else was reset.
---
I feel like „restraining order“ would be more negative for the restrained person than fpr the person who got the restraining order.
---
Would it kill you to simply correct them in a civil fashion?
---
the game kinda is like a tutorial up till you hit 80, as GW2 is a horizonal progression game. You learn a few mechanics and get time learning your class more as you level normally the first time. Once you hit level 80, most of the game's content opens up to you, and to a LOT of players, it gets kinda overwhelming since end game is less about grinding out a specific dungeon per se for the next tiered armor, but more of choose your own direction (be it forging legendaries(where weapons, armors and trinkets have different directions and content you work on) collecting mounts, collections, finishing achievements for item consumers)
---
But whoever got restrained was found out to be the "bad person" who needs restrains in the first place... You dont sexually assault somebody, do jail, get restraining order, play a game and get offended by game's achivement name because it reminds you of the restraining order haha
---
Ok, so the 3 rares every 3 chests per 100 chests is per day, then? So about 3 full chest runs per day will be under the limit
---
Yeah, I didn’t want to say you were wrong. I agree with you :D
---
There's a lot of good advice here in other comments on the best classes to choose from, but honestly I recommend you go with a warrior to start with.  Get a couple of axes and spin to win which is super fun when cleaving packs of trash mobs, and for your other weapon go for a greatsword which looks awesome on your character's back.  This will introduce you to the second most important game mechanic in Guild Wars 2: Fashion Wars.  Because we don't have endless gear grinds, many of us grind out all the coolest looking legendary items and then stack them all on one character whether they look good together or not!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But on a more serious note, even though there are clearer roles of support, dps, buffing, healing, etc in end-game pve raids, PvP and WvW, whilst you are levelling up the most important thing to focus on to make your life easier is damage, damage and more damage.  Forget trying to tank up especially when you reach the level 80 areas or the expansion areas, it will only make you die more slowly.  Go with berserker's gear and kill the enemy before they kill you.
---
But, if warrior doesn't grab  your interest, then I heartily recommend guardian as an all round utility class with equally good DPS.  Also, again, GREATSWORD.  If you're a pet sort of person and the idea of going through the world collecting all the possible pets appeals to you, then ranger is also a good beginner choice... and... you've guessed it:  GREATSWORD.  Remember, all classes can use multiple weapons and the weapon determines the main set of abilities.  But not all weapons the class can equip will be effective for that class in all game modes.  e.g  The staff is an excellent weapon for the guardian in pvp and WvW but pretty useless in pve.
---
Do you like PvP?  GW2 has two great pvp focussed game modes.  Match based structured pvp and large scale world vs. world where you can sometimes have up to 3 squads of 50 players fighting each other although that does get a big laggy.  The necromancer is another good beginner class and is not too shabby in this arena atm.  The Reaper specialisation is effective in pvp (and can use a GREATSWORD) and does good damage and the Scourge elite is a META class in WvW.
---
Engineer, mesmer, thief and Elementalist are generally considered a bit harder than the others for a beginner, but if you're an experienced MMO player then honestly you should probably just pick what you fancy playing.  But understand that most classes have varying degrees of ranged/melee options and things often change drastically with elite specs.
---
Alright, I finished my research. I updated the post with the information I was looking for, if you're interested at all.
---
The new approach is better because you actually have to do the events and stay in the map. They should go a step further and make the coffers unavailable to those who didn't participate. Not fair to everyone who did the event if you can just hop chests willy nilly.
---
[Play In Story Order Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/)
---
Should have been a guaranteed Scion weapon chest after completing The Battle of Dragonfall achievement 
---
25 map metas is already quite a lot and we’ve seen less effort required for achievements that reward an ascended weapon
---
I think Orange and Purple came out much better than the others. In any case, this was pretty interesting.
---
You can start any story chapter that you own, yes. Really hard to say since there is a lot of content and stuff in between even doing story missions. Maybe 4-6 hrs if you really rush it? Could be more than double that if you go at a more normal pace though. Yes you can do War Eternal without the other living story episodes but it's not going to make any sense and you'll spoil the whole story for yourself. Also the new mount (skyscale) requires the other living world episodes anyways.
---
And that is a design flaw that shouldn't be encouraged. I only actually do Ab meta once every 2 months yet I loot a big chest every day for my amalg gemstone. I love that in Dragonfall I am motivated to do every event I come across.
---
Damn that's a good catch. My favorite show got even better
---
Didnt take it like that, no worries. Just got me thinking about this messed up idea of getting restraining order and then being offended in a game.
---
I read the thread. If you don’t want the other person commenting on your responses: Stop responding. You’re putting yourself in the position of „the victim“. If you don’t stop responding you have no right to complain about the response.
---
If you link item codes it message suppresses you, if you use the ctrl+click method, it does not.  So spamming it, almost by definition, means they are linking the item
---
[removed]
---
Is there a specific reason you think it's changed (you can use spoiler tags)? I don't remember any major reworks to the story and all the chapters are the same. I know for sure the personal story was changed a long while back though.
---
I think it was a premature release, given how they took it out of the live client so fast with a hotfix and didnt mention it anywhere in the patch notes. It was just not supposed to be there.
---
And I wouldnt be surprised, if this is just a working item/recipe and wont reflect the final version.
---
Obviously, this seems to be related to their announcement of legendary runes and trinkets, as other users already mentioned.
---
However, the name is a bit too generic for me, if you consider the ingredients.
---
Why would a Gift of Upgrades only require Charms (besides Elonian Wine)? 
---
It would make sense to have a "Gift of Runes/Charms" required to craft a Legendary Rune. But Gift of Upgrades indicates that it will be used for any Legendary Upgrade, so not only runes but also sigils (and maybe legendary orbs or jewels, after all, we need another sink for orbs, now that the 2nd set of legendary weapons is out and Amalgamated Gemstones wont see any demand spikes with every LS release).
---
So I quite sure that the name "Gift of Upgrades" is just a working title and will be changed before release and if they change the name, I wouldnt take the recipe, requiring 250 of each Charm, serious either.
---
Pls tell me you are using this full berserker too.
---
Those are slightly different though because HoT metas are usually on a timer so you are more limited throughout the day while dragonfall is whenever you complete the events, plus you get an insane amount of loot per chest in dragonfall compared to the HoT metas, heck EVERY meta has less loot in the chests compared to dragonfall. TDR: dragonfall chests too op to just buy the keys
---
I've also not received any of mine - the Living World part of the board is working, but the trophies are not coming in.
---
woa! is that a non-trenchcoat medium armor I'm seeing!?
---
Is there any way to keep track of how many Carpenters you have opened / events?
---
I kinda disagree with that just do to how fast some of the bosses drop, if you get hit off the mount or just take the wrong turn during the bonus boss round it might be dead by the time you get there. So at least its nice you still get the chests event if you missed the champ.
---
Omg I'm SO excited for this! One of my fave movies as a kid!
---
&gt; rng from the meta
---
What? You get a box that lets you choose whatever piece you want.
---
yes, but the box itself is not a guaranteed drop as far as I am aware.
---
Even the gathering tools are berserker
---
I haven't seen a single pre since launch DX.
---
I've been looking things up on the wiki for a long time now, but I never knew about this page. This is going to save me a lot of time in the future! Thank you for sharing!
---
And we even cannot use transmutation charge to make other character use the visual effects
---
:(
---
You must not have played a lot of other games if you really think that.
---
Yup, or even make multiple leg trinkets besides backpacks.
---
That's the country they're based in, that they are most familiar with the laws of.  It makes a load of sense.  What didn't make sense was the lack of testing on the app.
---
What would not make sense is a promotion only available in a small series of obscure shops in a country they aren't in.

Mounts can skip to your Skyscale at Buried Archives, Cursed Shore if you use the wall to fly around from the north going east, then south. You get auto-dismounted just as you land on the ledge. Combination of Springer, Bond of Faith, and Griffon will do it.
---
Oh. I don't really play Raids, so I guess it's easy for me to just play power/condi Berserker exclusively on my warrior. I just don't like Core or Spellbreaker, they just get boring quick for me (especially Core banners ResidentSleeper).
---
I do have condi and power sets to switch between at any time, which I'm proud of :^)
---
I've always pondered why ArenaNet doesn't take the Raid training area tech to the next level and advances it so you can do literally everything in this confined space.
---
 - Apply whichever skin to your weapons / armor or wear any outfit.
---
 - use any dye
---
 - use any toy, vanity item, mount skin, glider skin, infusion
---
 - have a switch to swap lighting to different presets
---
This would allow for actual preview of whatever combination you desire, far less limited than the preview window, and most importantly you'd be able to move around and see how it works out.
---
Whoever they were, they did you a horrible disservice. Revenants are dope.
---
Activism is a form of politics, and pride month is activism.
---
How do I know i am not meant to do that. It's in game i can do that. My point is players should not be banned for exploits coz its developers fault not theirs. How do i know if that precursor drop once in 6 years is not exploit ?
---
Can you choose which weapon you get?
---
The wiki has specifics but diviner and viper are map based so you usually have to farm a specific map currency to unlock the recipe. You also need the recipe for all other armor which I think each master craftsmen sells. You can swap stats on ascended armor but not for free you must throw them into the mysroc forge with a insignia or inscription of the desired stats as well as something from the Mystic forge attendent it cost like 10 spirit shards. Legendary armor and weps can Stat swap whenever for free. You can also obtain them as drops from fractals and world bosses. Raids also can provide them. Completing each specs collection I believe also provides the associated ascended wep.
---
There are gw2 crafting sites with quick google search that will show you the cheapest route to crafting ascended. 
---
The only gear that can switch gears are Legendary gears.
---
I may be misremembering but I do believe that Tom Abernathy did confirm that all Elder Dragons suffer from conflicting magic like Kralkatorrik does.
---
There's also the whole "they're all evil and malicious" thing going on, even though their methods are different and their goals appear just as much so. Mordremoth certainly didn't seem sane like Kralkatorrik's good half. And both Zhaitan's and Jormag's actions could be described as "good intentions gone horribly, horribly evil".
---
Does your sexual orientation really define who you are to that extreme?  
---
I'd think for most people, they simply aren't interested in sexual orientation. For them it doesn't have a place in normal conversation, they can't relate to your experiences or why you feel the need to share it with them, and so it comes off as awkward to them.  
---
But I have seen a few LGBT guilds out there. Maybe you should consider joining one of those?
---
Issue hasn't popped up in a while, will make a fresh post if it does and take whatever comments are on this one into consideration then and try everything that's been suggested beforehand.   
---
Thanks for your help so far everyone!
---
Maybe it is a localization thing. I think the original, is more or less a United States pun. Now do the Brits, Canadians, Aussies, Kiwis... [etc etc etc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English-speaking_world)... care if there is a pun they don't fully understand? Probably not, but I also don't care if this is changed either.
---
**Good fucking question.**
---
In Warframe it's all in this massive gray area because normally these oversights do not net you an advantage over other players, a financial value, or means of breaking the game entirely.
---
When the Wisp warframe was available for full purchase on the Market for 35,000, there were many people who were quick to purchase it. They took advantage of an oversight by DE, but all systems were functioning as intended, they just messed up the pricing. Would it be fair to ban players who purchased Wisp for 35,000 Credits?
---
Ultimately it boils down to intent. If you can determine the intention of the player was to take advantage of this oversight, would that be enough to warrant suspension? A permanent ban?
---
As far as I'm aware, no one was banned for this particular example. Nor were they banned for the Hydroid Prime Access which was dramatically underpriced on Steam.
---
Players were, however, issued temporary bans, trading bans, and in some cases account permanent bans for the TennoCon Relay incident in the past. The reasoning DE provided was that these players were willfully abusing the situation to bypass a donation to charity.
---
The TennoCon Incident was a bit tricky, however. There were a portion of players who were essentially "hacking" the game by using a third party app which could inject certain account validations to allow you to access the relay. However, a greater majority of players were simply utilizing an existing in-game mechanic: Invite to squad or joining on a friend through the contacts menu. The latter could be argued to be intended gameplay functionality — the concept of a host player inviting others to a mission which is normally locked to them is not new for Warframe. For some players, it was dubious intent. For other players, it was thought to just be a perk of having a friend who bought a ticket. The official word is that only the players who injected and/or purchased items from Baro without having the proper account credentials were banned.
---
Another case study would be the night they added Eidolon Cores for Focus trade-in. Players discovered they could instead trade them in for 25,000 Endo. Bans were allegedly manually issued shortly after a dev became aware and then automated. All systems were operating as intended, players simply utilized the functionality presented before them. It's fairly common for these kinds of undocumented interactions to occur within Warframe as well and there was not any indication that this was not intended.
---
And finally, you can look at *literally all past events*. Every single god damn one of them has had some kind of super cheese mechanic which allows you to bypass all difficulty and get obscene scores. I think Eyes of Blight was by far the most important case study to look at and have written about it before, but Shadow Debt is another strong contender for the worst oversights and I don't think many players are even aware of just how that one was done..
---
**My conclusion:** DE is really inconsistent when it comes to determining what is and is not a bannable offense when it comes to gameplay, bugs, and oversights.
---
I'm not trying to fudge the line between exploit and oversight to pardon the players. There are some things which are absolutely exploits, even if they stem from oversight. For example, Twilight Grove farming via Host Migration and/or Reconnecting. It allowed you to bypass the Apothics cost and farm indefinitely. Inventory tracking had been poorly handled for a very long time and host migration *always* (even now) seems to break things one way or another. Abusing this to farm more drops and bypassing the "key" cost was definitely an exploit.
---
But enemy HP scaling bugging out and maxing at 10hp? That is completely out of the control of the player. Switch Teleporting an enemy off a cliff to kill it? That is something DE should be assumed to have tested for.
---
Otherwise we're going to have to draw up arbitrary lines to play within and constrain ourselves out of fear of playing beyond the scope of what the devs intended.
---
***
---
Ultimately, I think I'll close with this:
---
**We should not be playing the game under the assumption that the developers on incompetent, that the QA process is unreliable, or that other players in a competitive environment will not utilize the full scope of functional mechanics they have at their disposal.** 
---
If you feel like something is way out of line, like noticing enemies are instadying at high levels rather than becoming tankier, probably report that as a bug and then just keep trucking a long. It's not your responsibility to even report the bug, but hey.
---
Anything can be used in/for comedy. Whether or not you find it funny is another thing entirely.

I swapped my hardware around a while ago because my soundcard wouldn't work in one PCIE slot no matter what I did, switched it back now and cable managed the entire affair more neatly. Gonna try and see if it makes a difference, not sure how this went past my head when I was switching stuff around. Sorry!
---
Of course it can, just because it can be used in comedy doesn’t mean it’s not irresponsible to do so.
---
That's just how you internalized it, man.
---
I literally only meant that people who were claiming it was intentional were likely just doing so to convince themselves they were totally in the right to farm it *just in case* suspensions/bans hit.
---
If you've been playing the game for a while and have seen the other sources for Amalgamated Gemstones, it's pretty clear that at this stage it's only meant to be 1x per account per day. I don't think it would have been wise of Anet to ban people for taking advantage of this oversight, nor would I consider it an exploit. It was just a bank error in their favor and some of them were scrambling for a reason to justify why it's okay to keep the extra funds.
---
People are getting all needlessly triggered and arguing for no reason while I'm just [like](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2016-04/11/17/enhanced/webdr01/anigif_enhanced-28851-1460409005-2.gif)
---
Sure. Like with common chest : )
---
Ah yes, responsible comedy. *smug chuckle* I understand completely.
---
Comedians can still be dicks, comedians can still be wrong with their jokes. Calling it a joke doesn’t make it funny. Calling it comedy doesn’t make it a joke. Be realistic.
---
Actually, I want to turn off the effect. I just need legendary free swap only.
---
Nope.  It's for LGBTQ+ that haven't come out yet. It's for them. To let them know they are not alone.
---
There have been elements of that in the past, but the majority of Pride events are more celebration. And the agenda is what I said above. 
---
It's the only reason my husband and I still go and take part.
---
Tossing an occasional ascended weapon honestly isn't that big of a deal considering how little they actively affect power.  Honestly it would probably make the game healthier to do so.
---
This is what I absolutely hate about GW2. I love doing content intense objectives like the legendary trinket achievement, but I absolutely loathe dumping 1k+ gold to get the final reward.
---
I wish GW2 went with an either or method. Create journeys which are content intense and actually reward you with something nice at the end for all your effort. Or create journeys which are gold intense and reward people for farming/buying tonnes of gold to complete them.
---
It absolutely sucks doing all the content, working hard for an entire journey/collection only to not get the final reward because you're unwilling to fork out 1k+ gold.
---
It’s great and I’m enjoying it, but I really wish it changed color to match how my actual skyscale is dyed. That’d be amazing
---
 I'm not a big PVP/WVW player so I haven't tried that, but since each map's reward track gives the item you receive from completing all the achievements in said map, it should work the same way as it did for Aurora. 
---
The only issue would be for Jahai Bluffs, for some reason it's the only one that doesn't require the item you receive for the master achievement, but it requires a different item "Update Record of Joko's Deeds". You can only buy it if you've completed the master achievement for Jahai Bluffs, and it doesn't appear in the reward track for Jahai Bluffs' final reward chest...

now this is the gw2 art i like to see.

During progression, we used condi engineers to run green aoes and red splits. Streamlined kits and magnetic bomb caused many lols.

Cool stuff, let me add this to the thread: [Guild Worlds - a GW2 conversion for Dungeon World](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6ea6l6/guild_worlds_the_tabletop_conversion_of_guild/)

During practice for the KING tournament in 2014, we made it into the underground facility as dolphins. :)

As someone else already said, OG fractals are one big map. Somewhere on this sub I have an album of bugged out map breaks showing some of it. Cliffside is high above all the others, and you can walk through the sky to find snowblind and urban battlegrounds. Uncategorized is even higher up still, and you need to fall miles and revive orb to walk in the sky, and just barely make out the same landmarks that can be seen clearly from cliffside (the elemental source and fire pits). Underground facility and aquatic ruins are, not surprisingly,  underneath all the terrestrial fractals, and you can swim over to urban and some of the others. God damn I miss those days. :(((
---
Republic requests the individual to bow to the nation, the nation must not bow to minority ( wich not mean you ignore them ) otherwise you create communitarianism. That’s how they fought for individual liberties ( womens rights, anti-racism, ... ) and that's where the french theory come from.
---
  
---
In other word your witch hunt and the way the activists of this thread are trying to hide comments who are not right-thinking is really counterproductive and promote communitarianism.
---
Also, as a thinker of a true left. You should be wary about ultra-liberals who use LGBT fight for electoral purposes.
---
You get that much backlash from just things like mentioning you have a husband in normal conversations?  
---
I was under the impression that you were trying to have wider conversations about it, but if that's all it takes to cause enough turmoil to deter you from socializing, then it must be really rough.  
---
This is also what I meant about people may have trouble relating to your experiences. That most people wouldn't have experienced anything like that, so it might be worth reaching out to others who have had similar experiences to help you work through it.
---
oh i see, hows life with out mmo tho? if its a lot better then you shouldnt!
---
Only thing I haven't been able to find is the equivalent of bladed armor for weapons. Best I can see is festivals. Haunted weapons run the whole range of weapons while Zephyrite and Divine Sovereign weapons are a select few.
---
Its lot of Forza, Resident Evil, Witcher,Red Dead and Division and everything in between on a Xbox One X.
---
I think this makes a good point, actually. Despite the content still being more on the low side than what I would appreciate (particularly with raids, but W7 soon!), the way the developers actively engage with the community with updates, smaller patches, responses to questions, etc. has made the game significantly more engaging for me personally.
---
Props to ANet for making that shift in behavior.
---
How did you get this mount selector 🤔😮
---
I came back last week after a year long hiatus.
---
The technology is not there yet™ to implement a mount wheel.
---
You can't buy crowbars from VB, you have to do events for them.
---
Assuming you have high enough rank you can max out tickets per week, it's 21 weeks to upgrade T2 armor to legendary, or 25 weeks for T3 armor to upgrade to legendary.
---
And it can take 15-20 hours per week to get the full 365 tickets
---
I thought you could only make each backpack once...  am I a fool?!
---
Is that why frames can drop when you turn around, because it has to render everything asap?
---
You take commissions :D?
---
&gt; Fortunately, that has changed with the latest releases, and for that I’m here to say thanks to Anet.
---
As a WvW and spvp player nothing has changed, no dreams, more like nightmares.
---
Ah, thank you!
---
Armor was supposed to be around the cost of between 1-2 legendary weapons and the backpacks use gift of fortune.
---
Tbh I’m glad that the armor is just cheap.
---
That is a really cool pic!
---
I’ve tried taking a bunch with my skyscale but they usually look boring after the fact, and when I take it it’s more just my excitement of being where I am flying through the air than it actually looking cool 😂
---
Now u made me want to race change -\_- ... Looks Legendary !!
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
For anyone wanting the radial menu here's the link: https://github.com/Friendly0Fire/GW2Radial/releases/tag/v1.2.4
---
Eh, there are always the toxic crazy people that shit on everything and everyone. Thank God they're quite a bit rarer in GW2 than elsewhere.
---
It feels like Anet is very bipolar on what they want necro to be. Not to mention stuff like the 2016 halloween upďate where the patch notes said "Necro is in a good spot and just needs some small tweaks".... And the next line was nerfing condi reaper to the ground with the lich minion change.
---
&gt;Treating people equally and respecting race,
---
Then why did you delete my comment where I have expressed my proud in being white, pardon, person of light?
---
This entire story fits so well with the concept of the mists.  It feels like it could almost be a real cannon fractal experience in its own right.
---
Necro weapons need a rework. Especially staff and dagger. Staff should be an AoE condi weapon worth switching to. At the moment its ban worthy to carry a staff as Necro in PvE. Its that bad. If they want inspiration, look at Trident. THAT was a good rework.
---
Dagger (main hand mostly, off hand is usefull) needs to figure out what it wants to be. The LF generation isnt bad, but thats all it has at the moment. I also heard Dagger has a 2nd and 3rd skill, but I dont think they exist.
---
&gt;I know its RNG but
---
I actually came back about 2 months ago after being away since before the HoT release dropped (It was about to drop when I left) So as a long-time gone and returned player, what the Anet devs have done with GW2 since the original release is nothing short of amazing. 
---
A lot of people are complaining that things get left behind, that stuff doesn't get fixed and they mainly focus on the newer content and things that generate revenue, let me say that perhaps those people don't remember what the game was when it launched, the sheer amount of content, of NEW content as well as old content that has been fixed and improved is awesome. There are SO MANY QoL things that have been done even with the core game content that often goes unnoticed.
---
I am, as the OP put it, once again part of the dream that is GW2. And I'm loving it.
---
How is a random picture of a mtga-esque style relevant to GW2?
---
That's so good, do you take commissions ?
---
I’m really glad you like it! I personally just hit 3 years playing and it’s the best online game I’ve ever played. I’ve met a lot of really cool people playing this game and I’ve learned a lot. It’s such a blast and there’s always something to do. I do raids a lot and I love learning new characters for it. I’ve just started learning Dragon Hunter (Guardian elite specialization) to pick up another power dps class and it’s so fun. Keep on enjoying the game :D!
---
Is there? I always restarted the game, but that was not the best option.
---
Now I'm curious, what did they change about the personal story? Not to just hop on this thread or anything, I've just never heard anything about that before
---
common sense....
---
you should tell her to play GW2 instead!!!! I think she'll love it more than WOW
---
Yeah! My char is actually guardian!! and im a long way to go for raids. right now just trying to see how i can get my masteries up. Everyone is telling me to get the auto loot!!
---
Not in the vid, luckily ^^. 
---
What rune would you run in WvW? Fireworks?
---
minions dont suck, thats a bit harsh. they have fair effects considering theyre infinite effects at up to 0 cast time
---
man, this kind of reminds me that the mists are suppose to be sort of all connected canonically.  Honestly it feels like a lot of what you said could be an actual statement from someone who wondered the mists, such as Rytlock.
---
There are 2 rotation of Power Sword Weaver, one with Bolt to the Heart and one with Fresh Air. Both of them have values and their use depends a lot on the boss and the general experience/DPS of your group. If it's not written in the guide I remember seeing a comment a while ago (not sure if ti's 100% up-to-date but it seems good enough imo) about where to play which
---
&gt;if you were to play weaver everywhere you would run 
---
&gt; * Fresh air on vale guardian, gorseval, matthias, xera, cairn, mursaat, desmina and largos
---
&gt; * bolt to the heart on sabetha, slothasor, keep construct, samarog, deimos, conjured amalgamate and qadim
---
It is of course not at all recommended to play Power Sword on all the bosses mentionned above especially the Condi/Mirage ones and even on the Power bosses some classes can outshine Weaver (but that does not mean it's not a good and fun build to play there.
---
You probably won't get banned. In case like this one, it would require too much effort to see who exploited it.
---
But like I said, it's pretty obvious what is exploit. If you get one pre-cursor and move on, it's fine. If you see mob respawning endlessly and pooping out dusk's, it's probably heavy bug that's best to be reported.
---
Exploits tend to be things people *purposely abuse* to get ahead. Like getting thro floor in WvW and gank people from it on purpose for hours.
---
I know it's kinda offtop question, but is revenant and renegade itself kinda easy class to play or it will punish unexperienced player for it's mechanics? I am fairly new to gw2 and never played revenant before.
---
Same here, but after a 2 year one, A lot to catch up and the game feels fresh again.
---
If you start with a good build, it's pretty forgiving. You have lots of aoe, summons and CC
---
Matt Mercer is a great guy. He's also McCree in Overwatch, and he's been known to troll his teammates by saying things like "it's niiiiine forty five" in McCree's voice.
---
Nooo, maybe let's make Anet focus on Raid instead, and you will be happy, good stuff as well. And I never said I can't raid... what?
---
Stop this pointless argument and make rational discussion as most ppl did here
---
Oh god streamlined kits… Never forget…
---
If you think that more visual clutter = more fashion, you should be the one who should be handing in yours.
---
Besides, this post was to showcase a glitch not to show off my fashion or whatever, so kindly stfu.
---
You'll have more luck with pvp, wvw one requires the most time spent.
---
Ungrateful? Ultimately ArenaNet is a company and we are its customers. We support them financially. I give them my hard-earned money. Demanding a certain standard of them is not being ungrateful, it's what a reasonable, not brainwashed customer does.
---
I mostly agree with him. We have NOT seen what "new Anet" can do, all we have seen so far is a slightly better communication that is still way behind what it should be.
---
This isn't enough.
---
For extra fun, ask your friendly neighborhood Mesmer to moa one of the seekers.
---
(Wow Vanilla player here &amp; Gw2 beta player here)
---
Classes in Gw2 can play more archetype than Wow classes so here is what you can feel playing those classes (order matters) :    
---
Guardian = Pal &gt; Holy Priest &gt; Any Tank &gt;   
---
Elementalist = Mage &gt; Sham EL&gt; R\_SHam &gt; En\_SHam W &gt; Ret\_Pal  
---
Ingineer = Hunt / Drood /   
---
Necro = Warlock  /Mage / SP / En\_Sham / War\_Fury  
---
Mesmer = SP / Warlock / Arcane\_Mage / Frost\_Mage  
---
Warrior = Warrior  &gt; Ret\_Pal / Rogue  
---
Thief = Rogue &gt; War &gt; Feral &gt; Hunt   
---
Revenant = DK   
---
Ranger = Hunt &gt; Feral &gt;  ROgue &gt; War &gt; R\_Drood
---
You can see a good overview of some of the major changes in this [forum post here](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/gw2/Personal-Story-Restoration-update/first). Mainly in the September 2014 [feature pack](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/the-game/releases/feature-packs/) they added in the [new player experience](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/a-fresh-start-the-new-player-experience-in-guild-wars-2/) and reworked how the story was set up and grouped together. Later in that second update they mainly changed how the story went for chapters 7 and 8 (now the level 70 and 80 story,  "Forming the Pact" and "Victory or Death"). There have also been many small changes throughout the story but I was mainly referring to these big swaps and changes :)
---
Lol yeah it is. You can also check on the "Following" Tab to see who's added you as a friend that's not already in your friends list.
---
Okey. 
---
So first, in open world there are is no class trinity. Playing pure healer or tank is not viable. In dungeon/fractal content there are also no tanks (no tanking mechanics with taking aggro constantly). Only in raids and only on few encounters you have a tank but... In most cases it's mesmer (illusionist) and no one in heavy armor. Weird, isn't it?
---
Player "progression" is different here. Everyone starts (or should start) as dps. All classes are capable of everything. It's only your build and equipment that defines your archetype BUT it's also your personal skill level because it's action based game.
---
You will move a lot, dodge a lot. You will fight, shoot, cast spells while running. Get used to it. Do not skip leveling part because it's considered a training of game mechanics and knowledge of your class. You are expected to change builds on the fly (in endgame) to prepare for certain encounters. Just walking in meta build or changing it won't help, even in top tier gear unless you know your class synergies. You can still die in starting zone having fully legendary equipment.
---
Now, about class. I can only relate to current balance. 
---
All classes are great and offer all ways of playing, including raiding roles like dps, heal,suport. Most of the time only mesmer is considered a "meta" tank. 
---
Warrior is a good easy to understand heavy armor class. Don't really offer healing builds, mostly dps and boon support.
---
Ranger is easiest medium class wearer.  Have a very potent healing build and in open world you pet may aggro a bit making it a good choice for beginners.
---
Necromancer is easiest light armor class with enormous HP pool thanks to its mechanic. Viable as both dps and support, with some utility skills.
---
More difficult classes would be a guardian, that looks like tanky paper in but actually have low HP and must use various defensive skills (think it's mage in heavy armor). Super cool support, healer, dps. Then we have a thief, quick and stealthy class that IMO lacks in builds being in 99% a dps no matter what subclass. Again, using skills and dodges defines your survivability. Last we have a meaner. Most meta useful class so far, being a dps, tank, healer and amazing support. Rely on skills.
---
Hardest classes are: revenant, on top of cooldowns you have energy mechanic. Engineer, because he have A LOT of skills available during fight, and also elementalist, that have even more skills than engineer. All those three classes are viable as everything but require some mozart level skills.
---
My only advice is to not pick thief yet, because of lack in build diversity. Being support in two raid bosses means nothing.
---
I have so many rando names in that list from years of playing without realizing people added me. :’D feelsbadman
---
&gt;When PoF was released, ANET very clearly stated that they wanted more expansions produced at a faster rate and a cheaper price.
---
Where? I remember an interview of Mike Z from after PoF release stating the opposite.
---
What about the Plated weapons from Dragon's Stand?
---
The bug's been there since the beginning, though afaik the one OP's talking about doesn't occur while solo as it triggers off of joining and accepting credit off of someone else's story when on the same story step but with different conditional triggers in their PS (e.g., what order you joined - which is the most common way of seeing this bug).
---
Comments aren't cat people and are quite rude.
---
Giggled like an idiot. Most cats I've seen aren't interested in the computer screen, let alone a game. This is always hilarious to see.
---
OH LOOK A RAPTOR
---
CAN I TOUCH?
---
Yup, bug's been there since launch. It deals with the whole "shared story instance".
---
This is actually a fun way to get all three mentors to show up (and die together) during Battle of Claw Island, if you join one order yourself, then join someone who did a different order for either Setting the Stage or any of the racial sympathy steps, so long as you're on that same exact step at the time. Your Order will technically change when accepting credit, but during Battle of Claw Island multiple mentors spawn.
---
Going further, you will trigger any conditional dialogue for those Orders. For example, my sylvari who joined the Vigil, partied with someone who was Priory at one point (well past any point it matters for the PS), and because of that she gets Priory \*and\* Vigil responses (if they conflict, then Priory takes precedence).
---
Wow you're such a drama queen. NEXT!

---
What they did was that only level 80 characters will get keys for map completion but even then they are just so damn rare. You can be lucky for a while and then not be. RNG is not something precise.
---
16 Eldritch Blast Rays seems OP?...
---
Or 32 rays if you action surge....
---
That's weird...
---
I mean they are not wrong about it, necros dominate WvW, demolish teams in PvP if not focused hard and are one of the classes that basically only need to swap food and gear to be \*viable\* on every single encounter in raids, sometimes even taking key roles or trivializing specific mechanics. That is a pretty good spot if you ask me. 
---
The only problem it has IMO is that it has no meaningful utility slots other than epidemic. Power reaper has one useful utility (well) and 2 slots to basically take the least bad options. Scourge is similar and lacks a true alternative for epidemic in single target fights..
---
Depending on what events you do you will hit the 1000 just around the 25 completion of the meta. 3 from setting a camp, 3 from killing a collector (don't know how that event is called, the one where you killed 3 stones and then a serpent branded thingy), 9 from kralk and 24 (only killing 8 of the 9 champions) would put you at 975 after the 25 metas. If you set up more than 1 camp (the olmakhan one seems to always be after the other from what I have seen) and complete the 9 champions you would hit the 1000 chest during your 23 meta.
---
Their points are concocted nonsense. PTSD is a serious mental illness. It can come in a myriad of forms and should be respected and people help where possible. Instead we have a bad faith argument that is trying to claim that only some forms of PTSD (triggers to particular noises) are more legitimate than others (a general concept) because the poster conflates those that may be triggered over things leading to a restraining order as "self righteous attention whoring".
---
Instead of actual realising that PTSD can becaused by a large number of different events and that triggers are unique to individuals, only one type of PTSD is put forward as legitimate.
---
Ah, good old days of condi engi. I loved playing that. Haven't had time to raid in like 2 years now, so idk what they're like now.
---
You should check the entire cast of Critical Rola on IMDB, they have done a lot of work as voice actors in the gaming industry.
---
To be fair, the difference among metas is really the degree to which you can AFK. AB and VB stand out the most as being able to afk completely or for VB, come in and out for just 5 minutes or less.
---
Well said. That's why I will probably never get legendary trinkets.
---
I'm personally a huge fan of the female sylvari (and male!). The voice just fits so nicely and when there's parts where the commander is annoyed or shows some other emotion it's one of the better ones.   
---
The male sylvari is nice AF especially on something like a Reaper where you shout often. Other than them I really like the male charr and asura voices. Just really good quality and fits the races nicely
---
Is the preview window part of the TP? I thought that they were independent from each other.
---
That and absolutely no one is gaining any attention from this achievement name change aside from people arguing over what they see as legitimate PTSD in this thread.
---
&gt;Upon linking the weapon, I was surprised to see a large number of messages in squad generally calling me a liar.
---
Did you link it only once or did you spam ping it? Because linking it only once could imply that it's simply a chatcode. Sure, even if you spamping it could still be a macro but that requires at least some effort to set up.
---
Anyway, congratulations.
---
I just wish ot would adapt to the skin/color of your mount :( still adorable tho!
---
Excuse me? 
---
I wouldn't be calling others children with that sort of attitude and decorum. I was polite, you should be the same. 
---
I am saying wait, because their current efforts only seem like mana from heaven because of the sheer lack of updates in the past. (communication wise)
---
I have a lot of respect for the devs in Anet, some of which have left the studio now and I maintain communication with. BUT their efforts and work ethic is separate from communication based decisions and how the studio higher ups will handle the game going forward has yet to be shown as most of what has been implemented so far was already in the works WELL before the layoffs occurred.
---
I am not advocating panic, but I am also not advocating people praise the current approach to the ends of the earth. It leads to disappointment and extreme reactions from people who feel cheated or betrayed.  
---
People ironically like you, turning them into people that you seem to be complaining about.
---
I played it for maybe a week or two when we first got together and we still make Quaggan jokes every so often.
---
I got my boxes before they were tradeable. When I first started, probably about 2months, then got a second about 11 months later (so a month or two ago). For the first one I was farming almost every spot every day with a few break days. After that I got one, I would only farm casually. Haven't got one yet since the increased drop rates yet.
---
My buddy is trying to play GW2 again and is stuck in the desolation, he moves extremely slowly all over the map. He showed me what's going on and I have no idea, he isn't in combat and he is barely able to move on foot or on his mounts. He only has this problem in this map I think it is a glitch if it is a mechanic then it is nothing that I remember having to deal with. Anyone have any idea what is going on? He moves at a speed almost slower than being chilled, I don't know what is triggering it.
---
I agree with all said in this thread tho ngl I didn't feel any different during this LWS, like the game felt equally alive as before ever since LWS3 began I had this exact same feeling of "yh we good, game is gonna last a good while yet". Am I just too casual to notice anything?
---
I like how you are basically saying necros only have wells and pets as frequently used PvE utilities so you want to rework.... wells and pets ;)
---
Instead of a pet rework I would like to see a death magic overhaul that makes the use of pets more worthwhile than "transfer condi to pets to your enemies and gain 20 toughness for each pet active". For wells, I dont see a purpose in loading them with too many gimmicks. Each has their niche and could at most use a dps bump, either raw or by pulsing additional conditions. The true offenders in utility uselessness and inconsistencies are signets. Signet of spite has a power passive and transfers condis on active? With at 60s CD? WTF? Signet of locust makes you RUN FASTER? And siphon health on active? Plague signet is suicide in the situations where it would be most useful but at least we have signet of undeath. 
---
Something I dont like about the spectral skills is that Spectral armor and Spectral walk are basically the same in its purpose. I would love to see a power oriented buff to spectral walk and gain a completely new, hopefully offensive, spectral skill instead. Something among "pulse burning and criple for x seconds" or "gain power and ferocity for y seconds" to give us what necros need the most currently: offensive potions.

The problem in this game is that there isn't real end game goals, once you get your asc gear you are pretty much done, since legendaries don't add up any stats. 
---
So basically you get to raids and to endgame content, only for the look of your char :/

Crap, my bad.

Human female sounds like she‘s overacting sometimes. 
---
As if she forces herself to talk like that. I know part of voice acting is overselling a thing a lot but I dunno, it just doesn’t sound natural with her sometimes.
---
Same with human male. 
---
The new charr female VA sounds pretty good so far imo, she‘s very different from the original.
---
Male charr is cool (both VA‘s) 
---
Male and female Sylvari are great, same with Asura. 
---
Norn male is great and really suits him. Norn female sounds really cold and emotionless 90% of the time, as if she’s just reading the lines. Yeah Norn are supposed to be tough and strong, but she’s missing heart imo, the male Norn has that.
---
Taimi‘s voice annoys me quite a bit in how squeaky and whiny it can be, but part of that is also problems I have with her character. 
---
The VA is also not very flexible in her voice, every time she voices a different character ( like Valette Wi ) you can tell it‘s clearly her. 
---
I really like Logan‘s voice, I think it suits him perfectly. Same with Canach and Caithe, as well as Rytlock, and pretty much the rest of Dragon‘s Watch. 
---
I guess a random voice I don’t like is Pipeline inspector Zaina, something about her delivery and the fact you can hear the event voice from miles away just annoys me.
---
The preview from tp is the game, that's correct but the preview from BLTC I can't be sure about
---
Maybe he's walking instead of running. Check control options.
---
WvW takes the longest out of all three iirc.
---
Doing only the very easy raids and events is probably faster.
---
You also get LI for doing the spirit run event and twisted castle. So thats basically 2 free LI. Escort is also barely a raid. Another free one.
---
If you mix in a couple of the easier ones (cairn, mursaat overseer, w5 events) you'll probably get there fast
---
didnt that get changed?
---
Wonder how those sigils and runes will work. Will we get 1 sigil/rune out of this or a bunch? 250 of every charm seems like a lot of salvaged items for just one legendary rune.
---
that's a fancy ice statue standing around in Hoelbrak
---
It's awesome to see puppets being utilized again in 2019. 
---
People don't appreciate how amazing effects like this are.
---
No it is still a pull. I'm using it to pull these filthy "minis" in wing 6.
---
They used a rollerbeetle driven vehicle!
---
Can i haz dat?
---
I dont like this chair... I have to pay gems to learn my own skyscale I already got how to sit? And let me gues the dyes and upcoming skins wont match this chair?
---
Id be happy if we'd be able to zoom in and out on the Hero panel ..
---
Absolutely this. Any endgame content is in ruin. Scourge meta kills remains of WvW and PvP. No roadmap of any kind for WvW just bleeds gamemode even more. Swiss and Alliances are a meme at this point.
---
Fractals have 2 releases a year with no CM, we still do not have full set of fractals, fractal rewards a bit dated and you have nothing there aside backpack. In perfect world there we should have been unique legendary armor like several years ago.
---
Raids are a joke with 1 release a year. Most of the time LFG is filled with selling ads and Anet literally do nothing to invest new players in gamemode. A doubt that there would be even next raid wing ever. It is dungeons at this point.
---
While I do appreciate new mounts and trinket... once I unlock last one this weekend I literally have no reason to log in for next 6-9 month just before S5E2 to play E1 and get into E2 (I do not do raids anymore).
---
Male Sylvari and female Charr take the cake for me (even tho I play almost exclusively female human/Sylvari).
---
Personally I'm a huge fan of Jennifer Hale and I prefer her performance of female Sylvari later in the game.
---
As for NPC I absolutely love Taimi's voice range, and being a long time Troy Baker fan, I'll have to go with Logan (this guy can sing till ovaries explode).
---
I also have a guilty pleasure kink for Canach and majority of male Sylvari random NPCs voiced by Emery Gideon.
---
Damn that's some quality Charrt

If it helps minimise concerns, I'm adding to the rampant downvotes despite falling very much under the LGBT+ umbrella just because, sadly, the post isn't very good, in my opinion, and doesn't contribute much to the sub. We are going to be inundated with similar things constantly throughout June (and not in the threads for the organised Pride events).
---
Haha that's a cool video. Makes me want to make a norn guardian. I'm actually stuck between making either a guardian or revenant. They both look so cool
---
Now I'm curious. I think the old voice actress did a phenomenal job, so this will be interesting
---
Odd, they worked for me today
---
This is amazing! Do you want to draw my charr!!?? I pay with love &lt;3
---
I'm doing guardian next. I'm bored of necro
---
Why guardian over rev?
---
Fire garbage 😂
---
Right after launch no one was doing anything against them and half the people hitting a boss would be downed at any given time. So I get on my griffon and (besides tagging a boss or two) basically spend the entire event flying in circles dumping the pylons until there are none left.
---
With player culling and all the "normal" movement I literally don't see your springer and barely notice the presence of anyone in range of the pylon before it goes "ka-chunk".
---
Facetank potential. Revenants you actually have to play. And guardian let's me support guildies in wvw
---
he achieved ultra instinct
---
Boom ! Headshot
---
Can't you support with rev too?
---
Also I thought you could be super tanky with jalis and herald?
---
Start getting a [Charged Quartz Crystal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charged_Quartz_Crystal) everyday for the skyscale. It takes a minute and will save you some money.
---
Honestly based on that video and my playstyle I'm so keen to try that build.
---
Yup, I've made almost the full set of Light Envoy armour, and I think the picing is pretty
---
Wonderful post, thanks for the information, some stuff looks more complicated internally than it seems for the players.
---
With Rewards I really miss one thing. I'd prefer to have some kind of in-game info that tells me what unique can I get from each map and where. For example, this would highlight that some events are worth doing, because they drop some unique stuff. Right now people can check wiki, but it would be faster and maybe it would motivate people to stay in some maps for more time.
---
looks great
---
Haha yeah, me too. Monk wasn't even my favourite class but I helped people out so much there.. 
---
Really good times. 
---
On the other hand: it was terrible trying to find a decent group with two monks if you wanted to get another Claas through the mission. I remember waiting for hours to find a group who had enough pity left for me to Take me. Oh right and you could forget Mhenlo because.... Wait for it..  He was not infused either.
---
xD
---
&gt; don't taste very well.
---
That's because you're supposed to use your mouth, duh.
---
issue with this system whoud be number of cosmetic infusions you can apply to yourself,which is 20 and that alot for something like that,what i remember TERA had something similar,but its only for armor and weapons + 2 effects,but infusions for 10k without preview are indeed retarded.
---
is there any cap on the number of season 4 currency you can mine? for season 3, once you've mined a certain amount, all the mining nodes would just despawn
---
Infusions are really starting to turn me off this game I play 90% for graphics.
---
So what about doing endgame content not only for the look of your char, but with the goal to have fun?
---
I seriously can't understand this mentality that you need rewards for everything
---
Why are you even bothering - and then to top it off on reddit? 
---
a) no balance dev will read it and
---
b) no balance dev will care.
---
Idk, after 6 years gw2, you'd think players would have at least realized that much.
---
What build/weps? Wanna start get into WvW a bit more
---
Once I didn't get a key for (probably) more than 10 maps in a row, it's really all a matter of luck (or that one character being a very unlucky fellow).
---
On a complete world completion i get like 3-10keys and there is like 25 explorable maps? So 1 key out of 8 maps is still like normal.
---
Opposite it was stealth removed. It's been in a game for months
---
I love charrs &lt;333
---
well i havent.. just saw it for the first time while getting groceries. but i guess not everyone can have reallife *shrug *

You can acces ls4 maps without owning episode just by doing story with someone owning it.
---
Friend discovered this accidentally, we didn't checked others afraid of being accused of haxoring exploits.
---
So in other words it will take about a month assuming the average person can amass that many keys once a day.  
---
Seems "reasonable"
---
https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases is a performance upgrade, it's still a beta though. Also be sure that your graphics card is directx12 compatible, mine for example, isn't.
---
The Warcraft movie was amazing.
---
It's not a fan fiction. It's a page from a book that can be found in the game on the lower level of the airship in the Epilogue of LS4ep6 (homage to Snargle Goldclaw and monstrum27)
---
But I have no idea what Shaman is going on abt
---
Maybe the reason they think trauma triggers are fake isn't because of a video game achievement.  Maybe they think trauma triggers are fake because they're un-empathetic assholes.
---
Jormag would be so jealous when he sees this.
---
It's a legendary. Every legendary in the game comes with a large gold sink. They are the prestige reward of the game and I'd hate it if ArenaNet devalues their primary currency by giving it out for just doing content.
---
&gt;I wish GW2 went with an either or method. Create journeys which are content intense and actually reward you with something nice at the end for all your effort. Or create journeys which are gold intense and reward people for farming/buying tonnes of gold to complete them.
---
This is exactly how it works right now though? There are plenty of rewards in the game that are "content intense". Skyscale, most achievements/collections, raid rewards, fractal rewards, PvP/WvW rewards... And then there are "gold intense" rewards like legendaries, home instance nodes, unique skins, infusions, permanent contracts, etc.
---
Also, look at it this way: a large gold sink *is* a "content sink" as well, since you need to play content to get rewards. You don't have to farm endlessly or bust out the credit card to get a decent amount of gold in this game.
---
If you're still not convinced and still not willing to fork out some gold for the most prestige rewards of the game, then maybe set your sights on other rewards since you might not be the target audience.
---
Edit - But the tweet might just be shaman being shaman.
---
That's a funny screenshot, but it reminds me how much I loathe the game's default bloom. Praise ~~Joko~~ Gw2 Hook.
---
The only correct charr hairstyle :p
---
&gt; so I'm not taking it into account atm.
---
But you said "again, 6 in total".
---
Just say, its cool
---
Downvoting, because OP did not jump the raptor or move the character to startle the cat. I was super bummed
---
That's good to know, since I mostly play charr. Maybe I won't make Exordium after all.
---
If you think people are concerned because of the time it takes to "just get an ascended weapon" then i don't know what to tell you.  
---
Unless, of course, you're being obtuse on purpose.
---
If I have learned anything, it is that if Shaman doesn't explicitly say it's not a hint, it probably is.
---
Very true. I think it just looks worse and "shinier" in the preview window, which is why I never used Permafrost on my characters (except very sparingly or on specific armour pieces where it didn't look bad). I definitely wouldn't use it on metal or big glowy areas (like the Gem Aura outfit, for example).
---
I'm all about power to the people, but at this point I want less power to the designer cuz they are ruining the aesthetic of GW2, and mind you people, it's not coming back.
---
I've done a ton of map completion since they re-enabled them, and I've gotten plenty of keys. You're more likely to get a Transmutation Charge, though.
---
It is from a member of the community and is an Easter egg , if you even read the thing you would notice how it just describes the commander escaping the underworld in the story , also Wooden Potatoes says the same thing as well ;)
---
Yea, I was surprised that we are able to loot the chests from events we haven't participated in... I thought they'll patch that.
---
Well too me it was a matter of not so good people getting stacked in there because of the difficulty spike which resulted in the average PUG to be horrible :D
---
Fun times anyway, did that mission so many times as well :)
---
Aurene having voice, gave us the dialogue between her and Kralk. Grand daughter to Grand father. It would have been awkward for those lines to come out of Caithe. It really helped me to connect with Kralk and feel a bit emotional that another elder dragon is being eliminated. I did not want Caithe present in that final fight.
---
There's something odd about the previous female charr VA.
---
I have no problems with the voice, but at some point her acting got worse.
---
The new VA sounds a bit different, but she's already shown more emotion than the old VA in the entirety of pof
---
Ah man, the good old Monk strikes. My 12yo self was stuck on THK for a very, very long time.
---
It is canon, it’s based on the head that you see at the end of the 5th lws3 episode, flashpoint, in the final instance.
---
Oh good I though after 30+ meta chains I'd just never see them at all.
---
It spins for Norn too.
---
Don't follow that advice. Karma is far more valuable and harder to get than karma.
---
While necro does need the reworks to become meta pretty much all classes have some traits/utilities that need reworks at this point.
---
The problem arises in that necro has so much tankyness at base (even though it gets progressively weaker the more enemies it faces at once)
---
Changes to shroud would solve this issue.
---
Hopefully anet puts some more people working on necro and the less then useful skills/utilities other classes have so that we can see more meta options and useful stuff.
---
air warhorn 4
---
That looks sick... been playing since beta and that is a nice set or armour and a sword!
---
...not that I would know though... being a middle school teacher never let me have enough time to farm a legendary ever 😞. Closest I got to twilight/sunrise was my luminous blade
---
I agree.... I don’t have the raid set but I do have full mistforged (head to toe legendary + wings from PvP). PvP legendary start to finish with wings = 5-6 seasons (seasons are 8wks long with 2wks break between)... so it’s a year or so to get legendary PvP + wings
---
My next goal is WvW Armor.. to get Rank reqs Of 2k plus reach the skirmish limit takes dedication... probably another full year (plus I’ll add warbringer too)
---
No I will not make the raid legendary armor so I have no numbers for you on that set.
---
Rest assured NONE of it is cheap, fast, or easy...
---
Each piece of PvP armor from ascended to legendary cost like 300g (now x6 = full set... add wings and warbringer quests... yeah it’s NOT cheap what your doing)
---
*Also for me personally I feel stupid since I mostly play PvP so wtf good is “legendary” armor swapping anyway (I should have saved my 1500g and stayed at ascended level... same exact skin)
---
So unless you need legendary armor for some end game reasons like you swaps a lot... save that money (make an extra ascended set of whatever stats you need) and buy something far more useful like a bank tab or mystlock pass or just put the money into one of the new legendary because take it from a guy working on his 2nd set...
---
It’s honestly not worth it
---
Players that are interested mostly in open world stuff and story are going to agree with most thing you've said. Sadly in eyes of every player that plays gw2 mostly for pvp, zerg/roam wvw, raids or fractals you'll look like an ignorant. Most of the game modes are shelved, content for them is either coming out too slow or is just half-assed, there's near to zero communication from developers. Swiss were annouced **2 years ago**, like how they're not in the game yet? WvW balance was bad since PoF release and they keep making it worse with stuff like power hammer rev. And oh, my poor raids... ANet basically killed the raid community with their unacceptable release schedule.
---
An objective approach would be to wait and see while appreciating what they're doing right now, just like the real OP does it.
---
 save
---
Eh I can understand some infusions but the level some people take it to just screams your going to need eye surgery in a couple years.
---
Hey, I can actually see your character.
---
You're doing it wrong
---
I haven't *grinded* benchmarks, but both at the golem (some casual attempts) and in practical raid scenarios I didn't really notice a dps difference between tools and explosives. Tools however feels better to me due to reduced toolbelt CD and vigor uptime.
---
It currently has a long cooldown on it, and if it disappears/dies, you get a whole separate cooldown. My idea is that the pet autosummons whenever the cooldown is up. So if you were to use the active, itd go on CD, but then as soon as the ammo recharged, it would be automatically ready to charge again. The big difference would be that if you didnt use charge right away and let it get stacks, the charge would become a stronger move--this was mostly to bring some distinction to the pet as it was an elite.
---
I'll give it a try, ty.
---
I have used the recipe on one of my characters (without cooking skill). I intend to use another character of mine (with cooking skill) to make it. Do i need to re-learn it? But i have already double click consumed the recipe!
---
Well endgame wise you have to get expansions... Viable builds on guardian require either dragonhunter (HoT) or firebrand (PoF) specialization. And these two are more complex than Core guardian (but still pretty easy to learn). The same applies to necro for example.
---
This last bit is an absolutely fukin joke.
---
The skyscale is required to unlock the new legendary trinket Vision.
---
Just building on Marok\_Kanaros's comment as its a good answer.  
---
Been playing Guardian since launch. Core guardian is a very burst oriented class, though can be versatile and fulfill multiple roles. However, leveling during the core game doesn't require much thought into gear or build as its quite easy.
---
I suggest you do rush if you are finding it repetitive. Don't do map completion, just work on story missions and doing the bare minimum to level up to progress the story. It sounds to me like you need to be challenged, and you will not feel that until you get to the end of the story, or start doing dungeon exploitable mode (though that comes with a steep learning curve for new players).
---
The true challenging and rewarding content is in the expansions though. The living story is nice, but if you finish the story and try some dungeons and are still engaged, heart of thorns is a big step up in difficulty from what you will be used to from the core game. Path of Fire is harder, but not to the degree HoT is.
---
&gt;!I forgot about Aurene's voice. Yeah, I was very surprised when I heard her first time. Voice of a little girl. Doesn't fit a dragon, but Aurene is still young and... not too big.!&lt;
---
I normally hate the over the top mix on infusions people use. This one I oddly like... its sorta like a hologram feeling look
---
"and this, is to go even further beyond."
---
I came to GW1 a couple of months after it was released.   At the first mission area every group was “LF more Need Monk”.    So I learned how to monk and became good at it.  Never had a problem finding a group and was the go-to healer for my guild. 
---
TH Keep still sucked.
---
Yeah I played my Monk more often than I actually wanted to.  I was okayish to good with it but I prefered playing my ele. So that was kind of annyoing.
---
yep
---
If they added a "disable infusions" check box to the UI it would crater the price of infusions, wouldn't it?
---
*rubs eyes*
---
owwwww
---
Ahh excellent, thank you.  Free time is in limited supply lately so the thought of a few month grind was a bit overwhelming.
---
They are giving us weekly events now out of desperation 
---
For years Arenanet culture has been extremely long droughts of any sort of events/content and communication and treating their playerbase like they are the children
---
It has caught up to them sadly, i really hope that the entire company can turn it around even if NCSoft has to step in
---
It's a damn air elemental masquerading as a Charr I tell you...
---
Human female main here. A lot of lines feel forced trying to sound tough but I’m used to it. April Stewart also voices a character in Legend of Korra, and several Skyrim NPCs. I’m not sure if her voice is actually that distinctive or if my ears are just tuned to it but she’s one of the few VAs who will immediately break my immersion when I hear her.
---
I've only been using GW2Radial for about a week (too many mounts for my keybindings!), but I find that it often stops working after some time in game.
---
I've got the radial bound to my mousewheel key, and occasionally, gw2 seems to just forget that key exists. Does anyone else have this issue?
---
As much as I disagree on the level 80 boost and tomes in general. He implementation was fantastic with the idea of trialling with limitations
---
What tgdm said.  I wanted to cover how to tank if you weren't a chrono as well.  I didn't want people to think you need to be a Chronomancer to tank the Wyverns.
---
You also need rank and the lowest part wich are the gloves is 1500 rank and the highest part of gear which is the coat require a rank of 2000 which is probably what takes the longest to get.
---
&gt;ep
---
Awesome, thank you for the information :D
---
The point of the video probably was lost somehow.  Its to show how people can tank without having needing a dodge/block/distort.   How you don't have to be reliant on that at all.
---
The current utilities are pretty much set in stone too though. Wells arent used on condi builds. Curses arent used on power builds (not even BiP). Spectral skills are extremely niche in PvE and the same goes for some Signets.
---
Minions are weak but its better then nothing (flesh golem has good CC at least). Minions are almost the same as signets if you think about it. Equip and forget. Your idea for minions is pretty good, but I would change it a bit. I want minions that arent permanent at all. Instead you summon them for a short period of time, and during that time they will have a massive impact.
---
Weapons being condi/power only is fine. That is already case with the current weapons. And yeah, staff 4 is stupidly powerful when dealing with condis. They dont have to change everything.
---
It’s more subjective , what I can tell you is this , try different weapons, as GW2 skills based on the weapon you equip and use.
---
Plus, as you level up, you will unlock more utility skills and after 80 if you have the expansion you will get to unlock the elite specs. That also unlock a weapon type or off hand you were not able to use before in core.
---
Starting area and leveling is not as challenging , most mobs die too fast before you even click your third skill, but when you shift to HoT and PoF that will change a lot, as it will require more skill and knowledge of your own class.
---
One other thing you can do is try other classes, make a new toon, as soon you hit lvl 2 and out of the starting area, join PvP and check it out, you might find your calling ^^
---
Hope this help you ^^ cheers
---
Reading your response, the point of the video probably was lost somehow. Its to show how people can tank without having needing a dodge/block/distort. How you don't have to be reliant on that at all.

---
It's very conveniant having it tied to the mouse wheel the times it does work. I think X is currently used for descending when flying or swimming.
---
I'll try to rebind to a more common keybind, though. :)
---
The OOC aura is beautiful and subtle and I would love it if it didn't come with the floating disco orbs. One of the huge advantages of legendary weapons, armor and back pieces is that you can retain the benefits without impacting on character design or fashion. That doesn't seem like it will be the case for the trinket triad of trashy style.
---
[deleted]
---
I thnk this build has been nerfed as the boon duraition has been cut from 30% to 10% or something like that. SOme1 needs to update it
---
&gt;! Yeah I get that. Still don't like her voice and still doesn't change the fact they seem to like giving Caithe a new thing and then taking it away again immediately. I expected Aurene to talk at some point, but they literally just introduced her voice to us right after they told us Caithe is now the "translator" for her. Just felt meh and a bit rushed. !&lt;
---
Awww meow meow meow :-)
---
Oh did not know that. I had the rank and more so i never really thought about it. But thanks for adding it :)
---
If they ever add a proper "Effects" wardrobe section, they should also make sure you can only pick one effect of each type.  One full model colorize, one shader effect, one ambient particle effect, one aura, one set of skill effects, one arm sheath effect, one set of footfalls, etc.
---
You need the second expansion pack to use mounts. So you might have it ?
---
a charr using 10% of his power
---
Util we got heroes.
---
They I could leave a bunch of necrohealers around King Jallis and go explore with my little party.
---
I'd say power chrono is the most fun, followed up really close by firebrand quickness guardian. My oppinion, ofc
---
my pleasure :)
---
Hello. I am planning to make a alacrity renegade and I need advice for it. Is it wise to make my armor set full diviner's or would it be better if my trinkets and weapons be diviner's too? I just want a good Alacrity uptime.
---
Life gets like that sometimes
---
So you spent all your monye on shadow abyss dyes?
---
&gt; How would you approach it?
---
Start a new character! Just because you already played the game doesn't really mean you know it so treat it as a new game. Do not delete your old character though because of the Birthday presents.
---
You will learn the game again when you play it and a new character will teach you all the things we would need to write walls of text about.
---
No.
---
Good to know. Thanks for the explanation.
---
I want to get rid of the aura and keep the balls :(
---
I've seen the tail looking thing on many ss. Thought it was a back piece, is it from an infusion? Can you let me know which one?
---
Isn't Binding Blade only supposed to be pressed once so you can get the ticking damage anyway?
---
Weren't arenanet hiring?
---
They disabled it back then????
---
Oh fuck me, so thats why i didnt get a single key from map completion since pof.
---
So many completed maps completely wasted.
---
Solid advice
---
The lights are eyes
---
What is that on the back? I've seen it on a player, but couldn't find what is was :/
---
Oh yes, I remember Thunderhead. It was the biggest pain in the ass to solo but I did it.
---
Do you know which one needs to be changed to chainload?
---
hmm, it looks actually amazing
---
&gt;Human female sounds like she‘s overacting sometimes.
---
&gt;As if she forces herself to talk like that. I know part of voice acting is overselling a thing a lot but I dunno, it just doesn’t sound natural with her sometimes.
---
This, plus the fact that no matter how hard I try, I CANNOT UNHEAR Sharon Marsh.
---
Depends on what you have set up. Here's what's in the readme:
---
    ArcDPS is named d3d9.dll.
---
    GW2Radial is named d3d9_chainload.dll.
---
    GW2Hook is named ReShade64.dll.
---
We did see Mordremoth's Torment. Remember the shadow faces players see occasionally as Sylvari and anyone can see while inside his mind? They were speaking nonsense like Kralkatorrik's torment. 
---

This aspect of Madness was probably going to be shown more clearly some other way, but got changed or cut before release, based on artwork and trailers:

In any case, no fight against dragons was meaningless. Like Aurene said, "we didn't fail, we learned". Every failure told us what could and could not work, until we figured out what worked.
---
Been complaining about that for years, it's lame we get the short end of the stick animation wise with greatswords.
---
It's not like wow where low level content is broken and have no sense anymore. Leveling is full of sense in GuildWars 2 :
---
1- The world building and story revolves around hearts, and the plus side is that it's so flexible. No tons of text for each quest, instead there's NPC describing situation for an area and the bunch of quest in it, it's fully voiced over (as a french, it's even dubbed in french, it's awesome).
---
2- Leveling is not broken, you quickly get access to most of your skillset, by 31 you're almost fully operational, and if you try to get more than one mob by one, you'll gonna have some fun fights even in the overworld. The level syncing is fair so you can do whatever zone under your level and it's still gonna be fun (but the starting zones, of course you'll gonna one shot lvl1-10 mobs).

3-You ease up your endgame experience. By knowing your skills (fully), progressively discovering the world and features, endgame add up another good layer of content, and in the case of GuildWars2, remember max level doesn't increase, so you get instant access to many, many areas at once. Vertical progression (in wow and guild wars 2 leveling part) is easy cause you know what to look at (exp bar) and whatever you do to get exp is a learning experience needed to make you look in a direction once the exp bar is no more and you look at the world, the story, or whatever you wanted to do while leveling, and you can head up there.
---
Most if not all fractals appear to be in different spots of the same map.
---
Can we get that effect for Sunless Weapons?
---
You mean the standardising? That just enforces my point.
---
Ok, that is a nice looking character right there. Infusions done right!
---
Not gonna lie I like how this looks like an ice statue
---
Ahhhh I'm gay and I've very directly suffered because people have wanted my sexuality to not exist, and because people have tried to pretend my sexuality doesn't exist.
---
But they can pretend in their heads while they play guild wars if they want. But they're taking it further and complaining about the reality of my existence. And whatever, they can complain. But they take it further and demand I change the way I play the game so their gay-free escapism can be preserved.
---
Pride is just a group of people celebrating something together. It's like disliking music guilds because they break your escapism to a world where music doesn't exist. I'm not sure why they think people should change how they play the game so that their gay-free escapism can be kept intact.

&gt;  just went through a wedding
---
Congratulations! 
---
&gt; In our downtime, we created the salvage-all QoL feature.
---
Whoa, way to bury the lede.  This feature single-handedly brought one of my friends back to the game - little things like that are literal game-changers for people with wrist pain.  Big thanks to you and your team!

GW2 is the 'casual' mmo since PoF, it never was intended to become one in fact. The combat system is the most complex one on the mmo market, the core classes are designed to be played in multiple ways and no gear treadmill means the game is mostly skillbased. The game was never designed to be played like most of the playerbase do nowadays (which is pressing 2 buttons on the keyboard or running around the world and pressing F). The only reason GW2s playerbase is mostly casuals is because anet destroyed all other communities. No PvP updates, no balance towards WvW, no new tryhard PvE content (or very slow release of it). There were large communities gathering around PvP, WvW and dungeons (&amp;raids later on) 
---
throughout core gw2 &amp; hot that just dried out because anet didn't care about them.
---
Please share your secrets for the shaders, or have you done some editing afterwards?
---
The chests really arent op.

The actual fastest way to level up is to run around the maps that are about your level and kill all of the yellow mobs. Mobs gain more bonus xp the long they exist in the world without being killed. As a result yellow mobs tend to build up a ton of extra xp. Imo its incredibly dull and boring, but its effective. If you dont want to do hearts and dungeons dont. 
---
I tend to level up by doing dynamic events (show up with orange markings on your map) gathering anything and everything, killing random yellow mobs I come across, and doing the story missions as I get to them. 
---
But everyone has a different opinion on how they like to level and what is enjoyable. You can also level by crafting, there are lots of good crafting guides online that show you how it's done, so if you want give that a go. It won't get you to 80 but its something to break up the monotony. If I remember correctly getting cooking from 1-400 gets you 7 levels.
---
I’m not a salty sailor. I’m totally fine with the time gating. It made me feel like I don’t have to sit down and finish the Skyscale on the first day. 
---
You’ll need around 22 days worth of crafting a daily. (You can kinda buy this out.) You also need 250 of each living world season 4 currency. This would probably take 10-12 hours of farming if you don’t have this
---
My only gripe with this collection was the collecting the eggs. After running around the map twice already to go back and collect 22 new things on the map - that takes no skill - felt very lazy.
---
Or maybe its because of attentions whores spreading ridiculously massive ammounts of misinformation about them. 
---
It doesn't much to stop believing in trauma triggers when you got morons running around claiming that twitter gave them battlefield grade PTSD.
---
For making expensive gear such as vipers or the like its easiest to find the cheapest craftable ascended stat set through various websites and then stat changing it to your desired stat in the mystic forge, which just requires you to make the vipers insignia/inscription and does not require you owning all the recipes. That's what I did for my set of vipers light armor and it made life so much easier.
---
Agreed, I feel the "nostalgia" kick in the movie industry is really going. I hope they remake a lot of the classics!
---
2 drops in 2 years!? FML been playing for 5 and havent even had 1!
---
But I've always done this on the Unbound Guardian in Bloodstone Fen meta...  You need to chill.  
---
( /s )
---
You can save comments, which you can find on your Profile under saved
---
Totally no. There's no MMO nowadays that absolutely need teammates in the overworld, where quests are not indicated, or that is just like an MMO out of their 2000's.
---
You'll have to make yourself a reason, no one actually want these kind of MMO anymore (or just a minority of people). What is successful is MMO that does their things, fair and square, and well handled from beginning to the end. Final Fantasy XIV and Guild Wars 2, and in a similar fashion, ESO and Black Desert are successful because they all understand that. WOW retail is starting to lose it place because it goes nowhere, and break it's own old content each update.
---
But if you dislike babysitting, I'd say GuildWars 2 is easy on that. There are almost no tutorial, and when you unlock a functionnality while leveling, it only show so on the window opened for the level up. You only get details if you click on it, but you're free to ignore.
---
Also, it doesn't handle you while leveling, everything you do is worth experience for your only one bar : fighting, questing, dungeonning of course, but also exploration, map completion, harvesting, crafting, or PVPing. This means you can level your character by doing whatever please you, even just testing feature, it won't be a loss of time since you'll get exp out of it.

---
Same here. I have tried that dx12 proxy a few times now, but It's just constant crashing :(
---
Thanks!
---
I saw that too in my Google trek! My son has been trying to get me to watch Critical Role for a couple years. It's just such a big time investment. I downloaded one if the "one offs" with Jennifer Hale, Queen Jennah and the female sylvari PC voice actor, and will give that a try
---
It can be fun =D https://youtu.be/CIOc0eF9lAc

It's a bling ray
---
They literally only make this game to eek money out of the engine. All the layoffs did was prove that NCSoft have no faith in Anet's other projects so they ordered them to drag this out for as long as they can. I don't hate the game or the studio but it's not worth investment anymore, for me.
---
henlo pengo, i'm super jelly of that mystic infusion
---
On a golem boss fight without any AOE effects this build does indeed more dmg.
---
However... its almost impossible to keep up Aegis in a realistic raid situation or gods forbid T4 fractals.
---
Good luck keeping up Aegis on T4 Twilight Oasis (\*insert every other fractal\*) or basically EVERY Raid encounter where you get hit by atleast one effect.
---
I can only speak for me, but every single random player who refuses to play a viable meta build in either fractals or raids gets kicked immediatly.
---
The majority of core builds sucks compared to elite specializations -&gt;  thats the current reality (exceptions might be Core warrior bs and condi Engi)
---
If you put the mystic infusion on one weapon set it will overlay whenever you equip it. Works for the other outline polys too so you can do poly black with a poly red outline
---
\*eyes roll\* Seriously, realistically speaking, out of the hundred thousands of people who play this game how many of them will you see with Mystic Infusion, Winter's Heart, Snow Diamond, AND Polysaturating Reverberating Infusion (Purple)?
---
I only picked up the game a few months ago on sale and i've been stuck a few missions BEFORE TK.... i'm terrified of how long i'll actually get stuck on that mission.
---
I'm debating whether I ever bother with legendary gear because I don't want to have a bunch of glowy orbs floating around me.
---
Legendary wvw/pvp chest has glowing tentacles
---
I see! Thank you :)
---
I remember it fondly.  Now it’s just an ugly purple crystal mess, like so many other places I enjoyed.
---
If you're going to run that build in fractals, the build is slightly different than SC but not by much. https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/hybrid-renegade
---
Did they nerf the place?
---
My biggest issue with guardian is their extremely low HP pool.  They’re fun and all but they feel very squishy.
---
Beside instance, meaning boss, it's not fun to always need teammates to do anything in game. It's nice to play in group, but when your group can't play, and you can, well you can still do something in the world, even alone. That's why many if not all MMO doesn't require to play together in most open world content.
---
Wait for wow classic in august, maybe it can be your cup of tea. Back in 2005 there bro.
---
Daelin Dwin [swaps the skimmer mount model for Taimi's head](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKsSL3S4ZQw), but you're saying it's ridiculous to think the actual developers can swap a skyscale model for a skyscale model?
---
Cosmic mining tool might work for that.
---
1 2 3 4 5 6 etc
---
Imagine how much more content this game would have if they used the money they spent on product placement for development
---
A ten dollar word, someone opened their dictionary. 
---
IF you think the current method is crap, then offer a better solution. The reason why Game devs implemented the current form is because they believe given the resource they have, doing it this way is more effective. 
---
If you don't agree, good. You should not always agree with game devs, but be willing to offer your input. How can someone make you happy if you don't tell them what will make you happy, but then again, you do enjoy whining about this game, I guess that is who you are.
---
&gt;	Honestly I think your kinda blowing up over nothing?
---
I wouldn't say they're blowing up over nothing so much as reading into the facts a narrative that they've clearly long harbored an axe to grind, so now they feel it's a great time to let their "hurr durr PC snowflakes bad!" flag fly.
---
Most of their posts on the topic can be summarized, simply, by them saying, "I think it's ridiculous to want to *not* be a negative force in someone else's life, if it takes little or no effort on my part. Convenience overrules decency."
---
what kind of spy gear do you have in order to know no dev will read balance posts?
---
This is a good idea.  Another idea, is have a new currency drop once per meta and then make it so you can trade in 1000(or w.e number) of them for a weapon.  Grinding RNG blows, but if I could consistently see myself getting closer to getting a weapon it makes it better.  Just my 2c.
---
That's great!   
---
What's the armor you're using? I've been trying to change my Char Necro's look and DANGIT it's hard to make a light-armored char look good!
---
 [https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g300s-gaming-mouse.html](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gaming-mice/g300s-gaming-mouse.html)  This one yeah. I thought I had editted my post with a link but must not have saved it or something sorry about that and the delay.
---
You may want to try a more complex class like Elementalist or Engineer.  Guardian is fairly straight-forward, but I don't think that base Guardian is particularly fun.  It has a lot of powerful utility skills that show up when using either Dragonhunter or Firebrand, but on its own it's more of a support-DPS "Warrior," and don't let that fool you because it does do great damage when built for it.  
---
Much of what makes Guardian special is powerful utilities that give allies aegis, reflects or stability skills.  It isn't enough to have them on your bar.  If you take them then you need to have a solid grasp on where and when to use them.  Aegis is a temporary boon that blocks the impact of an attack and can be spread to allies.  Reflects work on missle based attacks and can make some enemies much more manageable.  Stability nullifies one CC per stack and is extremely useful vs. enemies that use knockbacks or knockdowns and other various forms of CC. 
---
Unfortunately, the base game isn't particularly interesting from a combat perspective.  I'd suggest trying the story dungeons as you level up.  [Friends vs. Dungeons is a helpful **NA** guild for getting people into dungeons.](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/comments/bggu03/napve_friends_versus_dungeons_fvd/)  They're very friendly, extremely active and organize dungeon runs just about every day.  You might want to get to 80 before the explorable paths as they benefit from having a full complement of traits/talents.  Dungeons can have sharp increases in difficulty w/o the right strategies or utilities, but the guild is experienced enough to help you get your feet wet with them should you decide that's your next interest!
---
Not bad, not bad at all... but how about you also throw in a +5% damage increase to axe skills?
---
This was over a decade ago so I don't remember too much. I know I was playing a Warrior/Monk at the time and it took dozens and dozens of attempts. I can't remember what I did differently when I finally beat it I just remember that Nightfall was the only campaign I never finished.
---
Oh god. Even now I still skip the Tahnnakai zaishen daily. Completed it twice, but I am much clumsier alone, and so that second time took about 10 tries.
---
Who says the mount skins can't be changed lol? It's a video game, literally everything can be changed.
---
I said it's ridiculous to expect gem store items to update because new gem store items got added. No, that chair won't update. They may release a new gem store item instead, but that's all we can reasonably expect.
---
That's what guilds are for. Constantly got asked by guildmembers to help them and their PuG. Was fun and people were always happy when a teammate was like "guildmate is coming to help us, he brings his monk". Was also good guild advertising ;)
---
Not so fun was that uninfused warrior/monk who used "heal area" to heal himself (and all enemies nearby).
---
Really? I Mena the gift alone is like 400g if you need 6 that's 2.4k gold for just runes. I guess it's possible it doesn't work like that and maybe it's a single rune where you place in and can select the 5 other runes.
---
this, worked on the second attempt for every single one of them on my end.
---
The easiest meta in existence now rewards one of the most expensive currencies for legionaries. I'd still call that good will.
---
Day one purchase if they had done that.  I really surprised they didn't.
---
People bring it up because it's part of the reason why Necro doesn't do 34k DPS.
---
Our "glass cannon" build is pretty much our tankiest build. We maybe need to take a different heal, but other than that don't need to worry about a thing. Because of how shroud works, we are inherently tanky, and the rest of the class is balanced around it.
---
Also Warriors are not as tanky. Both of these classes are my main. BS builds can take a bit of damage, but they can't sustain through damage. You have a heal that's for damage, and now that almost every fight is a Berserker build, 700 toughness. Necro has 19k HP, another health bar that you can use to survive a massive hit or use to sustain damage, a trickle heal if you have minions, life steal in shroud, and a downed attack that makes you damn near invincible. Warriors need to build for survivability, and by doing so lose all their damage and utility. Necro just is always survivability.
---
Necro isn't in a bad spot at the moment. We are an easy class to master, bench over 31k, and despite what you said, have very controllable burst, and offer more CC than Warrior since you don't really run core anymore. Yes, we get out classed by a lot of builds, but only just. And if it's a less than perfect run, our survivability can usually make up for the less damage we do. In your average raid, it's very easy to top DPS as Reaper. We just aren't the best choice for speed runs is all.
---
I am a huge fan of my asura guard, it feels nimble and powerful. I also like the sword animations and great sword animations on Asura guard.
---
As I understand it, OP's theory is not that Snaff *created* the split in Kralkatorrik's mind, but that he *reawakened* the more benign  personality which was previously more dormant/overpowered by the Torment. It's kinda an off-the-wall idea without any real basis in anything, but it also doesn't contradict with any of the facts we've been given.
---
The creation of the universe, by the looks of it

It's badass, congratulations for the great work :D.

When the cat followed the npc walking offscreen, 20 stacks of confusion right there.
---
I heard from a friend that the respawn was every hour, can I find any wiki/source about the timers of specific nodes, or is it just common knowledge? Did it change recently?
---
Hard JP vibes here.
---
Considering the fastest way to farm Orr wood (Malchor), which skin should be more appropriate ?  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8bbwcm/science\_exact\_gathering\_tool\_speeds/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8bbwcm/science_exact_gathering_tool_speeds/) tells Unbound is better, is it still true?
---
Just go full viper's you'll never look back .
---
i think it was a Centaur then, was when i was leveling a human engi
---
I crafted my first set. The first set is the hardest but worth it. It opens up a lot of possibilities. With full ascended gear you can make more gold / get more gear than you can in exotics. My first set was the best investment I've ever made in the game. That set has taken me into raids, through fractal CMs, etc. Definitely worth
---
Next time, you can shout at him that he's not a real centaur but a goblin with kleptomania :)
---
They'reused to blind people in front of the bank in Divinity's Reach so you can watch them walk into a wall.

Here's a summary of the story: https://youtu.be/RudzOqb-fRc
---
Scarlet's [German voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Djn9ZYDTFNM) was great. In a perfectly "for the evulz cartoon villain" annoying kind of way.
---
Most charr voices don't sound too good to me, they kinda feel like a human trying to do a "tough guy" voice (both sexes...) rather than actual beasts. Rox is kinda okay most of the time due to her sympathetic tone and Rytlock sounds like a Krogan with extra jaw chatter which is fine since he doesn't give lengthy monologues.
---
Truly personally *disliked?* [German Trahearne.](https://youtu.be/_iuvszrSlO8?t=560) Not for hating the character or anything but he often ends up sounding genuinely distanced or disinterested, not at all how I would picture a scholar suddenly forced to lead a military campaign. He also has weird/little emphasis in his pronunciation. Basically being a sylvari myself on my first playthrough way back when **this** is what really stood out to me about him in a negative light, I never got the "glory stealing" complaints or felt that his *story arc* was bad but that voice made me actively care less about the Pact's critical moments.
---
Use the lfg tool for dungeon. It's together with the friend list window. Put that you are a new player and to make it more challenging, try to explain you don't want to be carried (dungeons will be super easy if experienced players join you cause they have the tendency of being too good at them and overgeared. Maybe put "new players preferred" or something. That should help you with your need for challenge.
---
Ps: ele is a much harder profession compared to base guardian. Might wanna give it a try if you bored. Guardian gets harder at rotations with its elite specialization (firebrand) from expansions. Try your hand at pvp as well. You don't need to be geared and lvled there cause it's equalized, will also give you a chance and you can gain items and lvls from it. Good luck.
---
I'm also a 40ish guardian. Trust me that the game can be very difficult when it wants to be, just try the Catacombs dungeon on exploration mode and you'll see how ineffective you can be even when you're pressing \*every\* button.
---
However, what's weird is that since there are elite specializations, the game can change drastically past lvl 80. Dragonhunter and Firebrand play nothing like your typical guardian, not at all, to the point of being unrecognizable. So even if you currently do or don't enjoy guardian, it'll be almost unrecognizable later on.
---
I misspoke when I said it wouldn't be required for "anything."
---
I should have said it wouldn't be required for any content or gameplay.
---
So happy to kept the puppet thing if it was all CGI it would not be the same without it
---
Leave GW2Radial as d3d9.dll and put it into /bin64 then copy the entire d9d12pxy folder to your guild wars 2 root directory and run the install program, when it asks if you want to install it as d3d9.dll type in no then pick option 2 to install it as d3d9_mchain.dll.
---
Auto-loot is a tendon saver indeed. But if you put some focus, you'll get all of them and still have some points left.
---
No content ingame. Also we are timegated on "Pressing F" in PvE.
---
Actually, the darkest of purple dyes XD
---
I'm still waiting to see what the post about the barred gate in the SE corner of Mount Maelstrom was about. I was certain it was hinting at War Eternal taking place in Scavenger's Causeway, but that turned out not to be true and now I'm more confused than ever.
---
Impressive, very impressive. If only it could be a weapon.
---
Can we rain in the economy by doing this to chak egg sac and liquid aurillium too?
---
What do you mean the potions from daily recs aren't enough? You're well under the duration, and recs are easy enough that you don't need the potions to last through those.
---
recs always give 5 stack, you can get 1&amp;5 stack pots from the daily boxes
---
"Above plat" or "at plat"? I still think that your statement is a ridiculous assessment of the current meta with berzerkers, engineers, and sic em soulbeasts running rampant even in low-rated unranked games.
---
To be fair he doesn't playmuch Overwatch these days and as I recall was more of a support player than anything.
---
recs give big pots, which give 5 stacks. If you use one big offensive and one deffensive you end up with 15% more dmg and 25% less dmg taken :)
---
Oh yeah... so rec gives 3 5stack potion of each kind? Lol... thought they give mostly 1stack ones... then I might be good
---
If Mordremoth can attack the Mother Tree in the Grove, it can attack anywhere.
---
Also Braham
---
That's Sam for you
---
I would accept this on the launcher
---
Thanks . Sounds like I can finally feel safe to use them not afraid of running out lol
---
Skyscale is scaling the mountain. Why is it scaling the mountain?
---
When someone links something nice, I usually link some Toilet Paper, because that's how much I care about what a random person got.
---
Yes, recs always give the large 5 stack potions, but you can also get the small ones as random loot. Those you can trade in for relics
---
Try action camera. I personally use it all the time. It feels like GTA controls. 
---
(Never played Witcher 3)
---
It's like Lightning Bending, I agree it's cool.
---
But you can't see the human animations for Exordium and Eclipse and not feel a little jealous.
---
Because it’s cute.
---
To me it looks like he just did a desktop capture with GFE while also having this interesting to say the least postprocessing effect. Doing desktop capture does capture the overlay as well. I presume that this had to be done because he did not have the in-game overlay (shadowplay) on all the time, thus if he wanted to record the game he had to enable it and restart the game, which would have killed this bug for sure. That is why he used desktop capture which activates instantly and it allows you to record manually like this.
---
Yes I’m pretty sure that’s what I was thinking of. There was a long run to an endgame npc that opened up a large portion of the endgame maps for the snowy maps there. So long ago I barely remember any of it!
---
In terms of new experiences: 
---
No gear grind, getting level 80 exotic gear is fairly easy and will make you competitive in pve and wvw, ascended is a small step further in terms of more stats and is something to work on. Legendary gear doesn't improve stats, just makes stat swapping easy.
---
Horizontal progression. Because there is no gear grind, grindy elements are typically into other elements like getting mounts (which all have a unique funciton), legendary anything or collections (which serve multiple purposes).
---
No holy trinity. Every class can dps, tank or heal (with varying degrees of success, and ofc there is a meta for each role).
---
People paid for runs to THK because it had max level armor.
---
Nothing. the game is dead. Go play something else and leave this dumpster fire of a once great game
---
Well,  they were both done by Jim Henson's studio and designed by Brian Froud.  So that's why they look similar.
---
I'm a player who loves GW2 deeply, but didn't got into pvp.
---
Good things are;
---
Combat feels so good, even comparable to single player games.
---
Decent character customization. (Lately its not very good i heard)
---
HoT and PoF story battles are nice.
---
Different mechanics in PvE like bullet hell and platformer.
---
Event system and open world content.
---
No OP items, everyone wears the same items, and they're easy to obtain.
---
No gear difference in PvP
---
Mounts are fun to use
---
Bad things are;
---
Less Dungeon content than other games.
---
First 30 levels feels boring.
---
I heard about bad pvp state. (This is important, because PvP is a huge part of this game, and people don't like doing PvP afaik.)
---
Less content upgrade.
---
(Btw i play both GW2 and ESO, my GW2 accoutname is Guguzanza.8956, you can PM me when you need info. Didnt past lv6 in ESO but i think i'll return to it someday.)
---
Infashion Wars 2
---
I can feel the graphics lag from here.
---
Big buff cats
---
imo a spec like that would work if the minions worked like the shadow mender you can buy and summon from Dragonfall. they cant be dmged, can't be even clicked on, but they're there and do their job. now make few summons like that each doing sth (pulsing some buffs, doing some attack) and put it on skills and mechanics. i would just straight up make it the Ritualist spec and make it similar to gw1 ritualist
---
Thats pretty cool!
---
So I should be running dungeons first instead of fractals? Seems like the fractals had kore activity so went with them instead. Heard dungeons were dead so haven’t tried them yet, but I’ll see if I can get a group for one. Thanks :)
---
I play a soulbeast and have Aurora and I hate my own aura, as small as it is. I can't see anything through it.

Please post the armor pieces so if others want to, they can do it too!

There are quite a lot of puns surrounding the Skritt in general.
---
That's because it's not the skyscale you ride.  It's one of the other skyscales that Gorrik raised.  People were asking what happened to them; now we know.  They were turned into chairs.
---
No, it's a one time bonus.
---
Underboob Armor!
---
Depends. What do you expect from GW2?
---
They reworked berserker like a month ago
---
What bow is that?
---
&gt; I expected that it would be natural to run in the opposite direction of the Eater's life steal attack which would negate his ability to both deal damage and heal.
---
Wait, you're telling me that running away is the solution? :O
---
Every once in a blue moon I'll fire a Prime Light Beam at first shroom as soon as the fight starts, because I am a dreadful person.
---
Take your time don't rush.
---
Big Ol' Bomb right before you get sacrificed is a classic too.
---
I personally really like these ideas. I think for the minionmancer you would have to do an ammo system. Like for every kill you participate in you can raise a minion up to a max number. Have to do it this way because unlike gw1, the bodies of your kills dont last very long, especially in wvw where they can revive right away.
---

Yes, all content is still relevant, unlike other mmo's.

Any suggestions for a warrior? I'm relatively new - put a couple of months in on a mesmer 3 years ago and recently returned to the game, not been enjoying ranger or mesmer as much. Levelling necromancer but right now I've been having fun on my warrior... 
---
I've been putting all my points into berserker so it's gonna be a while before I can take up spellbreaker but any recommendations would help! My partner has just levelled a mesmer so I won't always be soloing things but I'd like to be tough and only really have metabattle to go by.
---
Very good point, you would build up ammo and then use it to summon when you wanted to.
---
Because it's there.

I have both expansions and getting to the point in LW season 2 where I'm going to have to buy the episode with gems.  I also some LW3 episodes I will need to get as well.  If I am going to do so I will probably buy some gems.  What other items from the gem store are worth buying that help make the game better, fun to play, or take away some drudgery (time savers)?  For example I do see unlimited gathering tools, but they are almost 2000 gems them selves.  So I guess I'm also asking the best bang for the buck items.
---
Unlimtided harvesting tools, and spend the rest on bank slots/bag space
---
Cool !! Looks very nice 
---
10/10
---
To love the mountain.
---
The only legendaries you can't hide at the moment are the trinkets (they said they're working on that); everything else can be reskinned, so if you just want legendaries for the stat swap, then make them and reskin them!
---
Hopefully no trenchcoats, like the current pvp medium armour set.
---
Shouldn't it be called Mountainscale then?
---
That would be a good way to piss off every whale out there with combined effects and lose them money
---
i could live with some Bloodborne style
---
Most i did was 8x ghostly + poli (because i'm a peasant) and ended up selling them because i couldnt see my character...
---
But this looks super nice!!!

---
wish i could join, alas, EU servers
---
There is no thing to discuss in GW2 PvP because its nonexistant and shit
---
They won't lose their money when they can't visually harass other players the same way they didn't lose their instruments when they added a player instrument slider.
---
But you can... you can enable standard friendly/enemy character models. 
---
Also, name one time that you will actually cross this person in a way that it “ruins” your experience?
---
You probably won’t even cross paths with them ever.
---
Living Story Maps are always a good choice for getting Ascended jewelry (specially Bloodstone fen, you can reset those almost for free).
---
Dragonfall is a good farming map, easy to do, and plenty of people atm, so yeah, if you can buy trinkets there, go ahead!
---
For me it’s the [combat mechanics](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers), they’re more interesting and engaging than most other mmorpg’s:
---
Wow. 
---
How long have you been on the internet.
---
I tp-ed into AB and the meta just ended.  I felt so dirty opening all the chests with the rest of the people.
---
&gt;	I have also Glyph of Tides'd seekers while in CA.
---
Same. “Oh, I have time to CA 4 before they need to be dealt with.” \*panics when chrono drops ball on quickness, fat-fingers attempt to exit CA, uses GoT in CA\* feelsbadman.jpg
---
Silver-Fed Salvage-O-Matic.
---
Draw me like one of your French egurlz
---
I think the time spent acquiring Legendary Insights is meant to balance out the cost of Legendary Armor. Legendary Trinkets like Vision and Aurora don't have nearly the same skill/time requirement for acquisition and should cost more.
---
Of course, Coalescence is an exception to the trinket economic balance and hopefully will be balanced accordingly when/if it's released with the next raid wing.
---
K thx
---
We might have similar interests in terms of soloing and difficulty.  Have you found anything in GW2 that isn't timed that could pose fun challenge?  I think I've ran out.
---
You could use the guild item to spawn it more often.
---
I remember it very fondly. I remember first trying the mission around fall 2005 - it was a challenge to get enough monks for party to begin with, but the mission with bonus was just insane. If your party managed to beat that, you could easily manage everything else in the core game.  
---
I payed GW1 a nostalgia/hom-points visit a few months ago and the mission+bonus was an absolute cakewalk with heroes. And standing in the outpost with no one around but npcs while vividly remembering the place being filled to the brim with players was kinda sad... But the fond memories of the heyday of gw1 are cherished and will always remain.
---
It would though. I don't really understand your point, are you just apposed to a pet / minion type class altogether? I can understand if you just don't like the idea of a pet, but pet's don't have to suck, they can be built and balanced in a such a way that they are good. Yes AI and other things would need to be fixed up, I am not refuting that. I am just saying it would be built so it is actually good DPS and has skills that are beneficial and can be used when you need them.
---
Sure, but they don't contribute as much to the normal flow of combat against anything that hits hard. They're good for farming nodes and killing minor mobs and veterans, but are quickly one-shot by champions or legendaries and then do nothing to help. If you want to fight tougher enemies you're better served by synergistic utilities that deal higher overall DPS than minions anyway and contribute boons/conditions/corruptions/etc.
---
You see people like this in hub areas all the time.
---
It's annoying. The game has a nice aethetic and they just take a bright glowing shit all over it.
---
Thanks! Astonished of how close Anna's hairstyle was haha, dont happen that often:)
---
This is actually better than i imagine! Whoa! Thanks for sharing.
---
The same can still be said of instruments. 
---
&gt; The amount of people "aurally harassing" other players was incredibly low. Plus who is to say that they're "aurally harassing" anyone? Maybe they just like the sounds? I have almost all instruments and certainly my intention is not to "aurally harass" anyone...
---
Yet we got the music slider, because when something is as annoying as someone pressing B repeatedly with the marriner's horn next to your ear like a vuvuzela or someone stacking so many bright visuals you can't freaking see the attacks of a boss, **ONE IS ONE TOO MANY**.
---
If someone thinks the value of a visual depends exclusively on how hurtful to other people's eyesight and player experience it can be, then it would not be that much of a loss if they left, as they'd be the kind of person who will purposely seek ways to diminish other player's experience.
---
If they made bade visuals unlockable for the account, selectable in a new panel, and limited per type of visual so they can't be overstacked, then people would be able to unlock all of them, and select the ones they want. Which would actually increase the value of such items, since more people would get them even if they have no need for AR, legendary stats or any of the main benefits of things that come with visual effects.  
---
They also won't be limited to the 18 slots in their gear and the effects that are fixed on their weapons, armors and consumables, only to the visual slots, allowing more combinations.  They'd be able to get all sorts of visuals over time and combine them in many ways, which would increase their value as it'll increase their demand.  
---
The only thing that would change with a system that only allows one visual effect of each type is having less cancerously stacked visuals. All improvements.
---
new armor sets? i'm so excited aaaaaa i hope they follow the route of the requiem sets and give us more pants options!
---
The 4th chest that can spawn the hoard is daily. No matter how many times you do the event, or how it stared.
---
Must-buys are one of each indestructible gathering tool, the copper and silver-fed salvage-o-matics, and a shared inventory slot for each of the above. I also recommend a permanent VIP pass if you don't have e the Lily of the Elon pass (Mistlock Sanctuary is best for PvE, forget what the one that is best for sPvP is called, and I personally like Royal Terrace for how compact it is) and a shared inventory slot for it, but it's not 100% necessary if you don't mind LA.
---
&gt; and it was only a matter of time until it shut its doors. Today, I can happily say I was wrong. 
---
Wait at least 1-2 years. What we're seeing are things either planned before the layoffs, or the direct result of the layoffs. It's not that Anet *suddenly cares*, it's NCSoft that took more control and told them to refocus on GW2. Just that.
---
Downvote all you like.
---
It *can* scale sky :)
---
As for how much ... need to go finish last collection.
---
copper fed salvage kit and unlimited pass to places like the mistlock sanctuary are probably my top two picks if you have left over gems. I also recommend getting extra bank space, but that's just because I'm terrible at keeping my bank organized and neat.
---
What do you find great about Elder Scrolls Online?
---
Am I the only one who enjoys clean shapes without any glow?:-)
---
What's the purpose exactly for the ranger shout nerf with Trooper and Reaper runes? Was anyone really abusing this?
---
i love this
---
I don't have a Skyscale, but all of these videos make it look completely OP. I don't get why people think it's underpowered, can't wait to get one.
---
I personally like using [Tekkit's Workshop TacO routes](http://tekkitsworkshop.net/index.php/gw2-taco/download) to farm living world nodes to get ascended trinkets.  Specifically, I find the routes for Bloodstone Fen , Bitterfrost Frontier, and Siren's Landing to be really quick and painless maps to farm daily.
---
But how would you distinguish between light/medium/heavy armour class
---
 /s
---
So my daily HoT meta event routine used to be: log into Matriarch at xx:09 and kill it &gt; go to TD, kill gerent at xx:30 (also kill treasure mushroom before or after main event) &gt; go to AB at xx:45 and wait for Tarir (kill mushroom while waiting)&gt; be done in 1 hour. But now with newest patch they added amalgamated gemstones to Crystal Desert maps as well, so I’m curious if someone could share their meta event route now with PoF maps included? Looking for most efficient ones, so I’d like to skip long events such as dragon stand meta, thank you!  
---
(Also I accidentally posted this question on the bug thread and was wondering why I got 0 replies, so sorry bout that.)
---
Dungeons are irrelevant mostly unless you're trying to gear a healer like a Heal Firebrand or Heal Druid, in which case you go to Ascalonian Catacombs, or you want transmute armor.
---
Nice post but Necromancer DPS is more than fine considering the utilities they can bring to the table, the overall tankiness and overall easy-to-learn dps rotations of both elite specs. 
---
Yes, people don't play them but buffing them to do the same DPS as other options would make them inherently broken.
---
Your best bet is saving gold and buying gems when they cost the least, because whenever there's big sale, the gem price goes up so you end up wasting gold instead of saving it.
---
Sales usually happen around new episode release.
---
Definitely get some unlimited harvesting tools. If it were me, I’d get ones that also get you volatile magic, as you can use it to buy trophy shipments full of materials that you can sell for gold. Extra bank slots are always useful as well.
---
Once you have all the must-haves for quality of life, feel free to get a few mount skins, glider skins, or whatever fashion items you enjoy. Otherwise, don’t feel like you have to immediately spend your gems. There will always be something new and shiny just around the corner.
---
As for me, I’m holding out for Skyscale skins...
---
&gt;People are still farming core events.
---
what people and what events. no one farms events unless it has good rewards.
---
&gt; Yeah kinda. Wing 1 is still relevant
---
maybe because all raid wing give good rewards? 
---
that's why no one was doing pof metas and events and instead farm hot and sw
---
even fractals, t3 is kinda dead and if you want to do a specific one in t4 that isnt a daily or recommended then good luck waiting hours upon hours to get even 1 or 2 players
---
I have a RTX2080 and I can’t get about 40fps on dx9 but with d912dxyi get around 70~90
---
It's been a while since I have done this one. I have a few characters that could use the exp.
---
Guardian has a lot of meta build options for PvE. You want some of the best DPS in the game? Power Dragon Hunter. You want power support? Power Quickbrand. You want Condition Damage support? Condi Quickbrand. You want to heal? Healbrand. All are viable. They may not be the best in each of their Fields but they're still strong options.
---
I would get the 8GB just for future proofing.
---
Rather take 2-3 levels of Warlock and then 17-18 of Sorcerer or Fighter. 
---
8 beams a turn with Quicken and each beam is 1d10+CHA Mod.
---
I dunno, there wasn't a Capstone ability ... I wonder why?
---
Sadly I can't make other people stand inside him. Maybe if we had Social Awkwardness in Raids :&gt;
---
 Can you make olaf Asura?
---
I don't mean to sound like a bummer but I'm kinda disappointed with the Scion weapons. They're just another reskin of an already existing weapon set. I was expecting something more of a blue colored branded inspired weapon set (ANET pls I just want a blue crystal sword)
---
Hrm, that's the thing. For GW2, that was a rebuilt from the ground up rework. For any other MMO it'd be a minor tweak.
---
I think Triumphant/Triumphant Hero's is genuinely the best medium armor set in the game. I only play WvW in short bursts when I feel interested in it for a month or two and the first one of those was because of that armor set.
---
Yeah I just ran it a second time and got it.
---
[I'm sorry.](https://letsnotnsaywedid.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/trees-dawg.jpg)
---
Power Firebrand requires all Zojja's armor pieces and most trinkets (except rings and necklace, which are diviner's)
---
if anet could fix their AI they would've done so already but even then your warlock would just give necro a shitty ranger pet
---
He explicitely said that this wasn't a hint.
---
It's called a Skyscale because it's judging you every time you ride it after eating another tray of omnomberry bars.
---
So i did not have the corsair jerkin or the boots completed prior to the collection being released. I just completed the "Dragonfall Mastery" for the boots and it did not unlock the dragonfall item in the collection.. it may actually want the jerkin..
---
Okay, I hear you loud and clear, Anet sucks and can't fix or make anything. Got it
---
Maybe some people have more fun using mirage than a better class?  
---
Isn't the goal in end to get enjoyment out of what you're doing?
---
Newest Living Story map, Dragonfall, is a solid farm.  It's still relatively new, and I have yet to see any reliable numbers, but it drops Rare Unid gear pretty regularly (3 pieces every third chest, and you get a min of 18 chests if you do the full meta; more if you participate in building up the camps beforehand) as well as a solid amount of blue and green unid gear (which you can ID for potentially even more rares) and mats.  It's also a solid Volatile Magic farm, since the Mistborn Motes are awarded pretty generously as well, and the VM can be converted to gold via trophy shipments.
---
Beyond that, doing a meta train is a really solid farm.  Tangled Depths into Auric Basin into Dragon's Stand is my go to for the HoT metas (and keeping an alt parked at Wyvern Matriarch in VB). With the recent patch, the PoF metas are pretty profitable too, since they guarantee 3 rare unid gear, and you can now choose an amalgamated gemstone from the end chests.  They also drop Trade Contracts, which can be used alongside karma to buy material crates from a number of vendors.  Haven't yet settled on an optimal rotation for these yet, personally, but there's almost always something up.
---
Finally, Tequatl is still a pretty quick and easy fight, that's well-attended, and gives 1 gold guaranteed, plus a chance at unique ascended weapons.
---
Personally, I like farming via these open world events, because there's so many now that there's often little downtime, they're generally pretty easy, so it's something I can do while just chilling, and it offers good variety; if I'm tired of one meta, I can just do a different one that's happening at the same time, and get roughly equivalent rewards.  Helps keep the game fresher for me.
---
Used the guild wars 2 wiki instead, made by multiple people.
---
Thank you!
---
You're late
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/buvt3i/mithrilnoxi_u_did_it_man_rofl/
---
&gt; what people and what events. no one farms events unless it has good rewards. 
---
World bosses are core events and are still done. Maybe "farming" is a little much for all core events but going into maps I usually see people doing the larger events.
---
&gt; that's why no one was doing pof metas and events and instead farm hot and sw 
---
In term of PoF Meta events I usually always find a party doing them.
---
In terms of fractals that's because people just want to get them done. All fractals are relevant but people prioritize time.
---
Oh shit, sorry, removing it
---
Aw crap! It's odd that it would work for Aurora and not for Vision... Did it unlock the skin in your wardrobe and all? Maybe this is something Anet could fix later?
---
well it took them a lot of time to do frozen 2 and honestly, it looks amazing and stunning, and we got to see just a single trailer yet
---
Sandswept has felt incredibly stingy recently, at least half my nodes give none, feels almost as bad as bloodstone fen right now, which I wasn't there for a few months but I swear it used to be more generous.
---
See the problem there is I'm shit at GW2 so I couldn't say. I was better able to wrap my head around the strategy in GW1. All I solo in GW2 is dungeon story mode and that's a cakewalk so long as you're at least somewhat careful.
---
Let it go, let it go
---
I'd think that the reward track item could work, just like it does for Aurora. However someone in the comments just said it didn't work for them :O
---
I hope this is something that would get fixed later by Anet. Or maybe a bug?
---
Because a handful of skins some months down the road will fix the issues with this mode....
---
Im quite new in the game.. could you explain what is this taco ?
---
And in that case every country needs to get its laws for promotions like that to exactly match all the others.  None of this x is illegal here but y is illegal there but if you go this way you need to fulfill a and b.
---
Which comes down to the real issue.  Lawmakers.  KFT had a global bit until people waved the laws around and ruined it. (Saw so many bragging about it, too).
---
What you're looking for is an Elementalist, but as a longtime caster player I must recommend Mesmer, it's just such a fun, versatile class. Clones are not intuitive, but the gist of it is:
---
1. Spells cast Phantasms which deal lots of damage
---
2. Phantasms become clones, which can sometimes take aggro
---
3. The max number of clones is 3, whereupon you can shatter for massive damage or utility
---
No other class quite so clearly rewards you for not dumping everything into DPS.
---
Incorrect.  There are lots of games that give no rewards but people play them because they are just plain fun.
---
yeah but what if it also SPUN
---
Bloodstone Fen's chances to give currency was massively buffed a little while back, it's output isn't *crazy* high, but it only takes a few minutes to do the entire route from beginning to end.
---
Sandswept Isles has not changed.
---
"reeeeeeeee"
---
You are completely and utterly wrong.
---
Right now only a few players get those visuals.
---
If they were account bound unlocks, more people would get them.
---
You get more money selling something once to ten thousand people than selling it ten times to a hundred.
---
Parking alts at the Draconis Mons JP is a low effort way to get a daily trickle of Orchids and a guaranteed level 80 rare.  You even get the level 80 rare if you park a mid level toon there. 
---
I also like it because it's super fast (log onto toon, hit F, character swap, clean inventory 1 time a week).  You can also take the parked toon to the Obsidan Sanctum in WvW for bank access when needed, then when you leave WvW, you're right back to the jumping puzzle chest.  This is great for toons you're not really using for any other purpose.
---
I would say it probably depends on how quickly you would otherwise run out of mystic salvage kits.  For me, since I don't play very long on any given day and tend not to be ultra efficient, it could take me weeks to run down one kit.  On the opposite end, I can definitely see someone who bounces between various metas for a few hours running one down in less than a day.
---
Yes, you can buy it through the gem store.
---
I would get these all on sale with your gems:
---
1. Living World
---
2. Shared Inventory slots
---
3. Character slots (until you get to at least 9 total so you can have one of each class to try them out)
---
4. Bank Tabs
---
Just know, if you haven't already, you will need laurels if you are crafting ascended armor or weapons for the first time to unlock the recipes. Don't be like me and convert them all to gold and realize you actually need them.
---
That's Deluxe, not Ultimate.
---
Then again, as far as I'm aware there's no difference between Deluxe and Ultimate other than the latter coming with an extra 4000 gems.
---
Well you are posting to the gw2 subreddit so I think I know what game your “really” want to play
---
Why not, like, play both and find out which one you like better instead of trusting random people on the internet? Both are good games.
---
Sometimes you need a healer even in high end groups because of instabilities. The best situation is to have both sets, but I’d go with Harrier first.
---
I have and still can’t decide. So I’m turning to the internet.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bv9njx/what_are_the_selling_points_of_this_game/
---
Thanks for this information.  One last question.  Is the world boss transporter worth the gems?
---
You haven't seen anything yet. Level 16 is not representative of what either of the games is like.
---
You can.  Doesn't change the fact that it probably wouldn't hurt the game to give them out more often though.  I mean it's not a game breaking amount of damage difference.
---
Honestly one of the worst things about this game is the difficulty of new players joining in.  Everybody argues that it's not bad and you can easily wear exotics and not have any worries as you start gearing up.  It just doesn't end up being nearly that easy for most though.  They get turned away from raids, they can't do fractals higher than T1 because of lack of agony slots, etc.
---
I'm not suggesting tossing it around like candy on Halloween, but there is for sure a step in between where it is and where it could be for newer players.  Perhaps just adding in a chain of one time quests that would fully gear a single character.  It would be a huge thing for player retention.
---
But, that's just my take on it.
---
All greens and worse. For yellows use master kit (you can also craft mystic kit, which is same like master, but has more charges, check wiki on crafting method). Exotic (orange) gear you can either sell on TP or salvage, if you have black lion kits, use those to salvage some exotics to get runes/sigils that may be very pricey on TP.
---
no, not really.
---
You can keep track of world bosses on your own pretty easily, by looking at the gw2 wiki event timer, so I've never had any use for it.
---
Even my 2gb gtx 960 is doing pretty fine, I play on max settings. So 4gb if only gw2, also 4gb is probably enough for most games at 1080p
---
I’m not quite at 250kp yet, sitting around 25 ess + the red infusion I bought a while ago, and title of course. Hoping to eventually get into those higher end groups. 
---
Thanks for the feedback, I’ll gear up Harrier first!
---
My gfs cat does this whenever we play together
---
Thanks for the feedback! I have enough free ascended boxes and stat-reset trinkets to make a Harrier set so I’ll do that first.
---
All they said is that an armor set takes 9 months from inception to completion. With the amount of hands an armor set goes through, that is very believable (and probably still true).
---
Thank you man :)
---
Also, what should I do to get the most money.. like item wise
---
What originally got me to pick up GW2 was that it has no subscription, and was (at the time) only buy-to-play instead of only free-to-play-but-pay-to-have-any-fun-at-all (now it's free-to-play as well, but not at all F2PBP2HAFAA). 
---
What kept me hooked was...a lot of things. The skill and combat systems are simple yet deep. Instead of games like WoW or TOR, you don't have a million hotbars with a billion skills all strewn across your screen, most of which do pretty much the same few things. You have one hotbar with your weapon skills, determined by the weapon(s) you have equipped, one slot for a healing skill, three for utility skills, and one for an elite skill. So for most classes, you have 6-9 choices in how you set up your skills (1-4 weapons plus 5 nonweapon skill slots), so you don't get overwhelmed by all your skills at once and have to be choosy in what you equip (though you can change out any skills/traits while not in combat). What's more is that pretty much every skill is different, both in use and animation. Plus the combat is really dynamic due to the emphasis on positioning and dodging. Many enemies will telegraph big attacks and show circles on the ground for AoE attacks, and you can use those cues to either move out of the way or dodge through (dodge rolls have invincibility frames like Dark Souls or Enter the Gungeon). That, plus the other active defenses in the game, like skills that block, reflect, grant short-term invincibility, teleport, evade, move you around, and so on, let you focus your build/stats more on dealing damage than on surviving (except in PvP/WvW and if you're playing a tank in raids). Speaking of combat, each class is both different and (mostly) equal. Each class has their own class mechanic (for instance, warriors build up adrenaline that they can spend to use a special attack, elementalists can switch between 4 different elemental attunements which change their weapon skills and some nonweapon skills, rangers have a pet they can command and fight with, and they can also unlock new pets by finding "juvenile" versions of creatures throughout the world, kind of like Pokemon). Each class has their own set of useable weapons, and don't share any skills between classes (so a guardian using a sword gets different skills from a mesmer using a sword), but each class is viable in most situations and are able to fill most roles (although some much better than others; you probably won't see a dedicated healing thief, especially since classes like druids and elementalists can heal others much better).
---
The biggest difference between GW2 and most other MMOs, and why it's difficult for me to stick with other ones, is that the game is designed to promote cooperation and to never make you feel bad that another player comes along. Resource nodes are all instanced for each player, so they're still in the same place for each player in the map instance, but one person harvesting it doesn't affect anyone else, since it's still unharvested for them, so you don't have to race other players to harvest them. Loot is also instanced, so everyone gets their own loot drops, and no one has to argue about "rolling need vs. greed." Also, xp, loot, and credit for killing things isn't locked to whoever hit it first/last. As long as you hit it enough, you'll get the rewards for killing it, which is unaffected by how many people helped. No need to be in a party to get the rewards (although being in a party does lower how much you need to hit something to get "credit").
---
One of my favorite things about GW2 is how it handles level scaling. I played ESO before and after the Tamriel Unlimited update (or whatever it was called) that set everything to the same level, and I felt much weaker then I did before. With GW2, instead of scaling everything up to max level, you're scaled down to just above the level for enemies in the area, so you're not overpowered but can still kill enemies a bit better than in zones of your level. Plus item rewards are split between rewards of your level and of the area's level, so if you ever need low level materials (and there are uses for them even at max level), you can just go to a low level zone, kill some things, and salvage stuff that drops. I'm not exactly sure how gold, xp, and karma scale, but you do still get a respectable amount, probably somewhere between what you would get at your level and at the area's level.
---
The game does mostly lack vertical progression after max level, which can be a good or bad thing. Personally, I like it, since I can get to max level, outfit my character, and then switch between any of my level 80s for whenever I want to play with another class, all without worrying about having to update everything for them  (same with taking a break for a bit, I don't have to grind all over again to get my characters and their gear to the new max level). The game does fill the vertical progression niche through other means, though. New elite specializations and masteries give you new abilities, and new stat sets for items give you gear to work towards (although so do new skins, if you become a fan of Fashion Wars), all without completely invalidating what you already have.
---
I could go on, but I already wrote way too much of a wall of text. Hope that helps!
---
Can Firebrand still solo champions?
---
BlackGate would have this AP in 10 seconds. Needs tactics puller AP as well. ;p
---
Could you detail what are those new weapons plz ?
---
But neither PvP or WvW have trenchcoat for medium? Closest is light leggings pvp. Unless this is a meme response.
---
C is default for descent
---
There's never a wrong time to rewatch Jojo!
---
What region? I haven't been getting any problems in NA today
---
&gt; If you haven't received one by the 1000th chest opened on your account, you will get one guaranteed.
---
Just curious, how did you arrive at this number when designing the reward structure for the map?
---
Love that you included this btw.
---
The infusions will be fairly negligible... Just depends what you value more.
---
I do fractals daily, But they do cost like 65 gold PER infusion so i really must be sure im not just throwing my money in the toilet
---
Hello thankyou. tagging is hard many say. It Fun too. Working together feel good like playing with friends. When commander luagh with friends in discord feels good. we are all friend. it is nice. friend told me about game they play but not play with me? Someday play with friend maybe and we will joke too. cannot joke with guild maybe. guild are NA feel bad. I do not see guild everyday. make guild maybe? thankyou.

They downvoted him because he spoke the truth.
---
I'd go for crafting your first leg! More tangible change/progress!
---
if you dont like GW2, (you always show up in these threads) why do you come here?
---
Why pick one? I play both.
---
They're worth it. For extreme min/maxing and completionism. If you're broke or need other stuff don't rush them.
---
As far as I know, after the last update you can select every stat if you have all expansions, but take it with a grain of salt.
---
If you're talking about the BLING vendor, you can select any stats your account has access to (meaning if you have both expansions you can get the ones associated with them).
---
it comes down to personal preference really, while the power infusions will give you extra stats and give you slightly more damage, the amount it gives is not very much to make a noticeable difference most of the time. while a legendary will not give you any benefits over a regular ascended weapon the convenience of stat swapping it and sigil swapping with it might come handy, but ultimately it is an investment in fashion.
---
so what do you think is more worthwhile for you? the little extra damage from infusions or the personal satisfaction of getting that legendary bling to flaunt to everyone else
---
ok then that sounds like it might be worth it then
---
I was thinking i could go on crafting my first legendary, and as i do that save the matrices i get for when im ready to move on the infusions. That way i dont have to buy them
---
EU - seems to have fixed itself after 5 mins but I've called it a day anyway
---
Most armors and weapons look utter shit though and shouldn't take as long to make as a baby.
---
They start of with a good idea, but apply that idea to ALL armor and weapon types even when it only looks good on one type. The process is way too forced.
---
Hello thankyou. english is ok. Playing with everyone i learn alot. learn rallybots blobs words! not give up. I tag everyday. take lands. get points help server . learn from people. I scout help big guild sometimes. kill enemy fight. Not give up. work work everyday. try my best. Thankyou. You too good fights.
---
Man, I love sketches like these. Keep doing more!!
---
I could have sworn you could make a tentacle version without but can't seem to find it on the wiki so perhaps not
---
well the thing is at my current state in the game its cheaper for me to craft a legendary by a MILE than to go for the infusions. But i was thinking i could go for the leggy now and as i keep playing i save the matrices needed for the infusions in order to save gold
---
THIS! Very much this!!
---
We have to be realistic here.

Do you know why low population is an issue? Because PvP fucking sucks. Skins won't fix that.
---
5 years ago when this game was good, sure, rewards would've been great. Now they do nothing, maybe a short term bandaid fix for what, a week? Less? Wasted dev time.
---
&gt;"That's on them"...what does that even mean in the context of pugging?
---
it means if someone dies because they cant dodge or position themselves or do enough damage, then it's their fault and not yours for not carrying with heals.
---
as for "but i could just bring heals and do it easily" - sure you can also do 5 staff guardian run, have fun taking longer than necessary/possible
---
Neat. I think I'd prefer the armor set before weapons since I believe Obsidian weapons were the most recent addition, but nice to know new armor is at least planned. Hopefully, these sets work a bit better than the Obsidian weapons...
---
Well if you can solo GW1 content, you can definitely solo almost anything non-timed in GW2.  You just likely don't have more time and practice than you want to put in, which is understandable.  But I suspect if you did, you would be also hard pressed to find difficult content in GW2.  The skill level needed in GW1 is so much higher (when you don't use heroes/henchmen).
---
Please add lights on it for next Wintersday. (-:

Ascended\*
---
Though you can upgrade them to legendary, they come as ascended. :)
---
Rewards bring people in but they won't make them stay. At worst it will make the game mode less fun for the players who take it seriously
---
You really should, it's great. Also, I love the drawing!
---

---
This things give you xp:
---
Exploration. Moving on the map and uncover it give xp
---
Map completion (which do involve hearts but i put it here anyway) give xp, mapbonus rewards, a blacklion key or transmutation charges and xp. 
---
Events. This should be the highest incom of xp. Is there a even make it. 
---
World events. There are litterally tons of those as well. Special events, world bosses starts in the low level areas already and other events involving legendary bosses or the like such as bandits, leyline boss, blood crazed, invasions and rights. All this give loot and xp. http://gw2timer.com/?page=Chains or https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_boss#Current_events are good timers. There are others use the one you like the most. 
---
Gathering. All gathering give you xp. Crafting things of what you gather also give xp. You can gain about 7 level and some more with buffs.
---
Dungeons. Story path is good to start with. Use the lfg-tool in game and create your group in it and wait for others to join. Make sure to write watch cutscenes, all welcome or the like so  people know it will be a little bit slower then speed runs so there wont be arguments.  https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Looking_For_Group this is how it works and how to find it.
---
Story. Every 10 level you will get new story chapters. Make those. They give you a good chunk of xp and gear and buffs and keys and other things that are good to have.
---
sPvP you can do this from lvl 3 and above. There is not gear grind in sPvP all is normalized so you will have the same stats as others do and everything unlocked that you own so far. In sPvP (and wvw) you get rewarded with tomes of knowledge. This give you one level each. WvW is depending on gear and you can get tomes there as well but you are not really that great to have in a squad or so because as low level you simply ar weaker. But just saying it is possible.
---
There are also festivals, there will be one soonish. The festival of the four winds which will give you tons of things to do. In the crowns pavilion you will have a way of leveling up in the boss blitz. You get tons of xp and it goes on and on and on. This festival starts in july last year and i expect about the same thing this year, maybe sooner who knows.
---
Thing about GW2 is that nothing will lead you the way to show you that hey do this or that. It is totally up to you to decide what to do and go and do it. Don't wait around for something that might happen, just go out and make it happen. Try new things out and grab what you like :)
---
So basically, cosmetic infusions have three types of effects: Auras, skin textures, and post-processing effects.
---
The latter two do not stack.
---
IIRC, Snow Diamond has all three (though the aura and post-processing are barely notable), while Winter's Heart has an aura and post-processing effect.
---
In most cases, when the effects conflict, whichever loads last / is applied last will take effect. In the case of Snow Diamond + Winter's Heart, if you apply Snow Diamond last, it'll override and you'll see only Winter's Heart's aura applied; if instead you apply Winter's Heart last, you'll see a stacking effect (Snow Diamond's Aura + texture; Winter's Heart's aura + post-processing).
---
There are some infusions that have priority - e.g., phospholuminescent will **always** override a polysaturating, despite both being post-processing.
---
When you want multiple infusions that have the same priority, but want a specific infusion to take higher priority (e.g., a polysaturating teal and polyreverberating purple), you'd want to put the one you want *lower* priority (in this example, poly teal) on a trinket without effects (or hidden armor/back), while putting the one you want *higher* priority (in this example, poly purple) on armor that has the highest amounts of effects (backpacks or legendary armor being good choices).
---
It makes zero sense to go 5 DPS unless you trust the other 4 players. Call me paranoid but I am gonna keep doing mechanics and embrace a support in random pug groups
---
&gt;Changing maps will reapply the winter's heart skin tone instead of the mystic infusion so you will have to reequip it.
---
There's two ways to prevent this. As others have said, applying to weapons (works best if you have one for every set though) is one way.
---
Another way is to apply the infusion you don't want to take priority (in this case, Winter's Heart) to a trinket or hidden armor. Then apply the other infusion you do want to take priority (in this case, Mystic) to your highest-graphic armor piece (based on image in OP, I'd say either the chest).
---
The effect that's applied when there's conflicts is always the last to load in. And since trinkets have no models, they load faster than armor with effects, so any infusion on them are more likely to be overridden.
---
Depending on your armor getup, this may not be a 100% fix, but it'll fix most of the time.
---
Well for me it is GW2. I want to play ESO i tried it so many times but i end up quitting. Even at points were i decided that i will do this regardless i still end up quitting. Reason simple, the combat absoutely 100% sucks in ESO. It is clunky as fluff. And to a point were i walk around being annoyed about it feeling this is shit. And combat is something i will do every day for hours and hours and if it does not click with me then i can't play that game. 
---
GW2 have fluid combat system. You can move, you can dodge, you have two weapon sets were each weapon have different skills, you have combofields. you have runes and sigils that matters ans builds that matters and have synergy. You can bend you gameplay to be freaking amazing. Or you can choose to play ESO and feel meh each time you use your weapons ;)
---
The base game is free so just try it and find out.
---
Honestly, probably never. There's not enough interest in WvW, in and out of the game, for it to gain enough traction to validate the venture in the first place.
---
says the guy using fowl language and name calling
---
I'm not getting the point you're trying to make
---
I’d rather they have a wardrobe system for infusions.
---
WvW is actually far from "balanced" in terms of build diversity. But more importantly, when the gameplay boils down to (A) spam endless AoE circles on the ground, or (B) spam support skills in any order you feel like, you know there is a serious problem with class design and power creep that desperately needs to be addressed.
---
sPvP has a similar problem, although not quite as bad as WvW.
---
Each armour piece has a collection, you probably unlocked a piece of one of those collections, such as a lining or casing.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistward_armor
---
Yeah, sorry. The last couple attempts didn't take and reddit auto-removed it. I think I did something wrong, but I think I got it now. I guess I am a reddit noob \^\^
---
How did you manage that? I can't even wander around as a ranger being harmless, and clearly trying to just tame an animal without random passersby assaulting me.
---
Nah I'm pretty sure that just means that person is an asshole.
---
As others have said if you are aiming to min/max as much as possible then its worth it, even more so if you are regularly playing with a grp that also does that. If you are not that type of player then I have to say its not worth at all. The 150 while nice is minor compared to mastering your rotations and fractal mechanics. Knowing what you can get away with, where to swap in what skills etc make a bigger difference than 150 stats every will for the average player.
---
&gt; It was such a pain getting monks for this Mission and I swear that 75%  of all attempts playing this mission failed with random groups **because  you had to keep this dwarf alive at all cost.** 
---
Gross. I dislike having to keep things alive during a game.
---
I don't remember, simply because I haven't gotten that far, yet. Thanks for the tips! ;)
---
Just in case - did you restart the game?
---
Verdant brink is the best for armor, except for chest. You can only get it when you have t4 security, and at least 100% participation. 200% guarantees you will get the bladed armor box.
---
Think of it in terms of +precision.  18 infusion slots.  90 precision.  15 precision = 1% crit.
---
6% crit is a lot.  Absolutely worth pursuing.  Much more tangible than a bit of +power imo.  Legendaries are very shiny though.  I'd go leg first, infusions later.
---
Not sure what that guy was on about as far as quests are concerned.  GW2 actually doesn't have a traditional questing system.  Still a great game worth trying out though.
---
get better runs then instead of slogging through the bad one with healing builds o.O one good run can reduce (actually prevent) the wipes + be faster.
---
while it's true that i am an internet troll (thanks for reading so much about me, im flattered), i only gave you the example of 5 staff guardians as metaphor for sth slow, suboptimal, undesirable. 
---
and im speaking from experience, having around 1300KP from CMs i can tell you that parties using healers are extremely unfun to play, and take so much longer to complete the run. especially if the healer is pretty bad (and usually they are, because only noobs play on purpose with healers in fractals) so you can't even expect boons from them.
---
It's typically considered terrible, with a few exceptions.
---
That's because the Jackal gives barrier on dismount
---
They're very different games.
---
A suggestion I have if it's okay to offer?  Tackle champions in open world.  When I started GW2 long ago, I tackled everyone I saw as long as I could do it solo. It really developed my skills as I had to change my build and strategies.  It also helps to recognize "tells" and more.  
---
As you're aware likely, open world offers champions ranging from really simple to relatively difficult.  That way you can find one where you're at and go from there.  
---
I suspect you're better than you give yourself credit for and with more practice would do really well soloing most things.
---
Would be simple if the world was good or bad, the French republic is not tied to communism.
---
The fact that this is the only thing that comes to your mind through your political prism make me really sad for our societies.
---
I believe that's a solid plan.
---
Well since you have a diviners set you could move it over to your ren and try it out. Imo ren is much better as a diviner than harrier. You are filling nearly the same role with both set ups ,harrier setup is more angled toward being the healer for the group and you deal almost no dmg. Diviners you still have the same cc, perma alac, some might and most importantly meaningful dmg.
---
I enjoy full celestial on my guardian.  The added toughness and healing makes it so you can stay in the fray and continue to do damage.  I find that even if your dps is nerfed a bit, being able to put out damage while taking damage without breaking away to dodge, etc...is a massive net gain.
---
Almost like ncsoft did shut down two projects and say focus on gw2.
---
For a first set of berserker with budget runes it's not that bad
---
I'd go Diviner's and run with a Heal FB if you can.  Heal Quickness FB is nicer and a harder carry than Harrier Ren in my experience.
---
Hopefully the weapon set is better than the Obsidian set
---
I’m trying to make a crit damage build(melee). It’s an elementalist(Weaver). But since ferocity is always a minor stat, and I want to splash in a bit of healing power, I was considering celestial.
---
It is very much a long term goal. Assuming you have zero relics or fractals mats of any kind it takes a min of 287 days doing CMs, T4s, recs, potion conversions.
---
https://discretize.eu/augmentations
---
Thanks so much. That makes a lot of sense. And yes, I’m planning on mainly PvE. The only reason I was looking at vitality is because with some Weaver skills and runes, I could gain precision and ferocity based on my vitality. And with water attunement I use healing a lot. But what you said makes sense and I’m starting to see that I don’t loose a little power from one piece, I loose a lot over my entire character. Thanks again for your response!
---
Just go berserker.   
---
It's better to learn the hard way how to play with the gear you'll be expected to play in team-oriented endgame than to pick some dumb gear and then be kicked for low dps or dying constantly because you're used to facetanking instead of dodging.  
---
But regarding your question, celestial is used by a handful of wvw builds, iirc elementalist is not one of them.   
---
Marauder as well, only a few wvw builds.
---
In the absence of other fixes, yes, look at what happened with the Warclaw, WvW was populated for 1-2 weeks then returned to being same as before.
---
Just one of the devs using invisible mode.  GM Chris used to do this when he was going around kicking AFKers during the Scarlet invasion.
---
This is great. Personally enjoying WvW more and more, just reached rank 1.500 this week and looking forward to have more stuff to unlock after I'm done with the Legendary Armor.
---
Tonics work wonders in WvW as well.
---
That's bullshit.   
---
There's only a handfull of enemies that actually focus on the one with the most toughness. Iirc all of them are raid bosses.   
---
However, even after 6 years of playing I have no idea what's the trigger for aggro in pve, it seems to be pretty random.
---
I'm not into self segregating myself. So all good. I am social with people in game, but I don't really bother trying to make connections. It never goes beyond randomly helping and chatting with new players for a couple hours. I have a couple close friends who I play with when they have time.
---
I'm sorry you had such bad experiences. The infighting and bigotry in the LGBTQ+ community can be quite sad.
---
Thanks for the warning as well.
---
There hadn't been butcapes in so long stop it with this outdated crap
---
For open world full zerkers is fine cause let's be honest.....it's open world. In fractals I run assassin rings and an assassin helm, rest zerkers. In fractals you'll crit cap with the offensive potion buffs. Same setup works in raids so long as you're getting spotter in your subsquad. If slow uptime is an issue bring Time Warp instead of grav well.
---
Wait... Howl, is that you?!
---
I hope that if you ever see my dog wandering around Lion's Arch alone like this that he is being a good boy.

Sometimes he likes to steal my water balloons and bobblehead tonics, though...

Greed, as we can see, never sees reason.
---
Have you even stopped to consider that to make an unlockable version of an infusion, people may have to use a mystic forge recipe that uses 18, specially for those that have gotten cheaper? That infusions could become less rare that way, allowing people to test them out more freely by putting them on gear before making the unlocker by buying several ones? That content that may drop them may verify that way, and keep them equally valuable even if they were to become less rare, just spreading that wealth more evenly?  
---
Of course not. You just jumped to the conclusion that people would just right click an infusion and unlock it. Because greed makes you fear losing something that isn't as important as you think it is.
---
Great, evidence of me suggesting we kidnap a dog.
---
What everyone else said is true but I’d like to highlight what I think is the main selling point: this game has the best combat system out of any game I’ve ever played, possibly the best of any mmo. It feels super fluid and like your skills do stuff and are something that you’re doing instead of just pressing buttons. Can’t stress this enough.

I appreciate you having a meaningful conversation with me about this. I'm not sure why you're being down voted because I don't feel you're being rude in any way. You're politely asking questions about things and trying to understand. That's more than most people. So thank you. I up voted your comments because the conversation has meaning. 
---
Polite discourse is hard to come across nowadays. 
---
And yeah it can be that rough. I'd rather help countless randoms who appreciate the time you spend with them.
---
Mistonium nodes are the epitome of inconspicuousness.
---
From my experience it's whoever is dealing the most damage over the course of time.
---
Pay for the run to Droks, farm troll cave outside for 1,5k armor with W/Mo... classic.
---
It has too many stats, so they had to be lowered a lot. And that resulted in it being mostly crappy.
---
It would be better if they reworked the single celestial  stats into a series of 6-attribute stat combos. For example, celestial for core, then 1 per season and expansion. Se we'd have "Celestial", "Demonic", "Draconic", "Godly", etc.
---
Yup. I've had people I thought I connected with in game ghost me after they found out I was gay.  
---
I mean, whatever, I have friends so it's not much of a loss. But I just don't get how something that doesn't affect them can be such a problem.
---
If you're really sold on Healing, healing as an Elementalist *is* a thing you can do effectively.
---
Healing Tempest, while not "optimal" is actually a wonderful build when you're playing with less experienced players in 5 man content.
---
[This build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Tempest_-_Support_Healer) is a little outdated but it gets the idea across. You might want to swap Magi with Harriers or Marshals.
---
Basically the only role you shouldn't play as an Elementalist is a Raid tank as for various complicated reasons that's almost solely the domain of Mesmers.
---
I don't mean to discourage healing: If you're playing with some buddies all power to you.  I just mean to push the importance of picking one thing and focusing on it over being a pure hybrid.
---
You're welcome!
---
Ok so, for context. This is me out of bounds looking out past the border of the map on Harathi Hinterlands towards where Lake Doric should be. I was doing a permanent node run and was using my Skyscale to try to avoid the enemies in the crypt and just flew straight up through the ceiling where the node is, as apparently it is not solid.  Just thought it was funny and worth sharing.

This finished with Magister flushing himself down the mysthic toilet, 10/10.

This ^!
---
That's wholely irrelevant though. It doesn't matter that it's not tanky enough to stand in stupid 100% of the time. It doesn't matter that it doesn't let us ignore 100% of mechanics. It's still factored in for in game balance. And also, that's just not true. Our added survivability does let us survive a fuck ton more than these other classes. Do you play these other classes? Do you play things like thief or Berserker since the updates? You can die easily to random arena damage when your healer(s) are slacking. It happens to me all the time. Reaper on the other hand, I can take much bigger risks, and survive things other classes can't, all while in my "glass cannon" build. There's been multiple times (even more in fractals), where I would use shroud to desperately face tank damage, use stab in shroud to ignore just that one mechanic, just to finish off that last couple %. Sure, in a perfect raid group that doesn't matter, but anyone who thinks that doesn't pug.
---
That is exactly why scourge is considered a carry build. It literally let's you ignore VGs entire mechanic, and can single handedly let groups who otherwise can't finish a boss, finish a boss. It's not the best choice for speed runs, but that doesn't change the fact that it's still effectively a broken build. If they nerf it, then it becomes useless. If they buff it's damage, then it becomes too powerful. Like Reaper, it's in this weird spot that is too damn strong for uncoordinated play, but less than ideal when everyone has their shit together. This effects class balance. It can't do 34k and let you ignore every mechanic.
---
I wouldn't be angry. I use Necro for damn near everything, since so many people don't play at a high enough level for it to matter. It's added survivability and it's simple rotation let's me survive things that I shouldn't and keep my damage high. I need to worry less about how competent my group is, and focus more on killing the boss. I wouldn't exactly be mad if it became meta. However, I'm also reasonable about it's position in the game. I understand why it doesn't top the DPS charts. I see how powerful it is in its position. While in a perfect world it doesn't matter how tanky or squishy a class is, in reality it matters a whole lot, and it's factored in to anets balance of the class. You can't balance a class around "well since it can't be played by an idiot who ignores 100% of mechanics, we might as well let it do 38k on MO" because that's how you break the game.
---
People regularly call Reaper the king of open world. That's because we have a lot of cleave, burst, simple to play, a good amount of damage, and can survive things we really shouldn't be able to. These benefits aren't going to translate well into a proper organized raid, but how many pugs have you been in that are organized?
---
Stomp those grubs. Watch those ledges. CC on the third bite!

Unfortunately for affiliates, VODs are only kept for 2 weeks at most, and it's been longer than that since my last train :\[ But all of my streams are auto-recorded, so the next one will still be available for a while! Plus, if you ever need help with specific parts, please don't be afraid to reach out to me and ask for help. I'm not kidding when I say I play this game almost exclusively for the community now xD
---
Too much of a dps loss for the little sustain and support it provides.
---
I mean, there's PlanetSide 2 but that's likely a stretch because it's an FPS.
---
Just be aware that as a rev healer your big heal takes a second or so to "wind up" so you want to try to predict damage spikes.
---
Idk, I think you are giving too much attention to something that’s not a big deal. 
---
I don’t mind a toggle option being there but Anet tends to overcook things and that’s my biggest worry. I could easily see them making a change so you can only use a couple infusion effects at a time rather than just giving a toggle option to turn off/on. And that would be the wrong approach.
---
From what I experienced u thought it was intentional to spawn the magic to begin and teach you the route. But now I mn hindsight it's not needed. Maybe there was plans to make these adventures ?
---
I agree with most of what you've said, but I didn't feel, particularly as a new player that the first 30 levels were boring. I was learning the world, always experiencing different stuff. I guess to me that early learning a game stuff was handled pretty well in Guild Wars 2, better than most other games I've played.
---
In fact, the lack of the quest hub system, which most MMOs have, is what bores me. Running from a guy who tells me to bring him 10 wolf tails, to another guy who he sends me to? That I find boring.
---
In this game I felt I was exploring, moving around where I wanted to go. The beauty of the world, the ambient dialogue, and the process of discovery made the first 30 levels less than boring.
---
Obviously after I've leveled a few characters that's changed, but not until I'd explored each of the starter areas completely (and I don't just mean getting map complete).
---
Mostly only good for some WvW builds. It used to be good in PvP when it had significantly more total stats than other amulets, but has since been nerfed to mediocrity. It's basically useless in PvE.
---
Every map is basicly an island.
