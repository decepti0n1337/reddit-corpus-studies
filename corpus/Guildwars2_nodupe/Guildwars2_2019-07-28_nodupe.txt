Guardian, mesmer, or necromancer. They're the best three at the moment, imo.

I think Caledon and Metrica have beautiful aesthetics. Really all the starter maps do a fantastic job of condensing the "suburb look" of the races. Then probably some of the maps with the Brand in them. Iron Marches comes to mind, but I'm pretty sure I am also thinking of areas in some other maps and attributing them to Iron Marches. Core Dragonbrand does, I think, some more interesting things with the environment. A lot of PoF Branded map sections tends to just be giant crystals everywhere but if you look at Core Brand there's a lot of great levitation/fragmented buildings. There's certainly some of that but it's not consistent. And then I think Orr has a certain appeal. It wasn't my favorite at launch, but time has made me pretty fond of the unique kind of dilapidated Orr has become. You very rarely see a fantasy city sunk and then raised back up.
---
Necro is probably the best candidate of the remaining non-Rev classes to have potential as a base class due to Death Shroud being so fully unique. However, this is the exception to the rule, and ANet's balance team hates Necro so good luck making it usable. Warrior is probably next in line, though the maxed out adrenaline skills would need to be much more impactful. Both of these are theoretically fixable with buffs to the core classes.
---

---
Guardian virtues and Mesmer shatters are absolutely not reasons to pick the classes. Engineer's profession mechanic is itself a tradeoff excuse for not having weapon swap (since your utilities can be kits which are your weapon swap replacement, so you get a utility replacement in the toolbelt). Stolen skills on Thief are largely uninspired (except for their souped up raid versions), Ranger pets are more annoying than anything unless they're afk-tanking trash mobs in open world, and core Ele doesn't even really have a defining mechanic compared to dual attunements and overloads.
---
You're also not adding power creep. The power creep happened years ago with elite specs. The target power level is static.
---
Mind you, for the record, I don't even think this is necessary. I'd rather ANet spent their time making more elite specs than trying to invent mechanics to nurse core classes back into relevance.
---
Not even Blood Magic for me. Going fully into damage it's so fun watching clouds of mobs evaporate as you spin into them. Run into a group, spectral grasp them all, spin, watch all that loot come in.
---
The revenant legend has nothing to do with the plot of the game. I vote Trahearne so we can finally get greatsword on Rev.
---
I'm rich, you know!
---
For all the pre-PoF story, I must say that Herald was my absolute favorite because they have perma swiftness and - before they changed it in the latest patch - superspeed. All the walking in slow motion was just absolutely frustrating. It's also very neat if you don't have access to mounts yet. Herald with Glint/Jalis legends is also pretty tanky for world bosses. The glint heal skill will make you pretty much invunerable for 3 seconds so you can, for example, escape the posion fields at Tequatl or the electric field of the Golem Mark II before they kill you. Or you just stand back and AA with the hammer (1.200 range). All in all it's a very chill and easy class, but can be boring to some.

!Remindme 6 days
---
Your art is trash anyway. Wasn't big deal, there are BETTER artists than you.
---
Gotcha, thanks for the info!
---
wow homework in 30 min... at least in Russia before 2005 I was spending 2-6 hours to get that out of the way. And sometimes whole Saturday as well for the big stuff.
---
Bit would say from perspective of person that went through University and attempted some postgraduate education parallel to my work... most of that stuff was rather useless and the amount of exercises given was over the top.
---
You'll still have to somehow get yourself to the Durmand Priory, though! That might be a rather dangerous trip if you're level 2 :/
---
You're comparing repeatable pve content with treadmill based endgame. Raids and fractals are not treadmill, they are challenging repeatable game play.
---
I am new to GW2 also, and agree with your sentiments about the community. There have been quite a few occasions where I have used map chat to shout out for advice about something and have found people more than willing to give hints, tips and practical help. Even jp dailies have mesmers porting people to the end to save time and frustration.
---
I have seen a lot of negative stuff on Reddit in the weeks since I started playing but honestly I feel nothing but positive. There is content I don't much enjoy, so I steer clear of it. And I don't miss it because there is a metric shit ton of stuff to do in the game.
---
Well no, You don't because Elite specs are way stronger in most cases.
---
That being said, Core thief and Core guard are both meta in PvP.
---
Tired old Jormag and Primordus theory again, why is everybody forgetting about the still-active Deep Sea Dragon?
---
Also that trailer doesn't have anything resembling Guild Wars in it, you're basing your ''gw2 dead'' prediction on nothing
---
ANet has said that the next living world season will have features that are normally seen in expansions.
---
The problem is that when you go range you most likely will die more. The healer is focused on the people that stack and it will be awful for him to split his heal just so you can stay alive. Plus you wont get defensive boons like aegis,protection, regeneration or stability. Also you dont have defensive skills cause distortion got kinda removed, your heal is meant for damage and you dont want to use blurred frenzy and the block from the sword.
---
Additionallly you not only will do less damage as pro players but also significantly less then the average player. Reason is that you also dont get offensive boons. With domination and duelling you wont have any self quickness and the alacrity from the shatters doesnt provide a good uptime. Also you wont have 25 might all the time. If you would play sword your might uptime would bei very high in solo play but when you camp greatsword you have no might generation. 
---
That all combined will hurt your dps significantly. I would recommend to stand always melee when you are in a small group that wants to achieve something (e.g. fractals and raids). It will make the live of your supporters much more easier and you will stay alive more and do more dps.
---
GW1 doesn't really count as a traditional MMORPG though
---
because we don't want any more underwater content
---
At the beginning of that very fight, I got stuck in the door frame because the door came down on me directly.  
---
I was too far away from Caudecus to get hit much (so I did not die) or to hit him effectively. It was definitely one of my hardest fight because I didn't want to disconnect and have to do the whole chapter again. I don't remember how I managed it, I know I got up and made tea in the middle of it, but somehow I won the fight.
---
sounds like a blast, i did something similar with a random group of people in Divinity's Reach, we went from outside of  Divinity's and ran all the way to Shadow Behemoth as chest
---
ESO has the best PvP, GW2's a close second though
---
The idea that NCSoft will kill GW because they might publish another MMORPG is highly ill informed. You know that NCSoft has published multiple MMORPGs simultaneously for years, right? It’s kinda their entire business model.
---
my underwater stuff is asc. and has even +9 +5 infusions slotted in. x)  
---
and tbh as ele its not even as bad as you can change your build accordingly to even have a halfway decent rotation.  
---
its more this: can't really place aoes underwater, most skills are lackluster, skills are not usable, weird pathing where you are a few cm under a mob and suddenly your autoattack cone doesn't hit anymore (makes "floating" even worse because you either have to swim after or up again after being pulled down), weird enemy pathing and the movement in total feels reaaaaally bad.  
---
like, on land youare pretty fast, good animations and all of this and underwater feels sluggish as hell.  
---
its def. not "skill" why i dislike underwater  combat.
---
By far pvp (especially in wvw) is the best aspect of this game, and ironically the worst supported by anet
---
Yeesh!  Someone has been snacking on the crazy pills....
---
shit i did!
---
exactly! forgot to mention the insane tagging potential for events with many mobs and the deadeye huge rifle range which can be quite handy
---
People hate automatic party finders in every game that has it. It destroys communities, overly streamlines roles, and makes the content in it extremely unimportant and unimpressive.
---
I'm sorry but nobody has to ask you for permission to repost something that you publicly posted online, especially not if its just a recreation of a popular meme, start watermarking your images if its that big of a deal to you
---
The way you freaked out about this on your tumblr and the fact that you called for whatever followers you have to mass-report the OP tells me that you have a lot of growing up to do in general
---
Even if (and it's a huge IF) the new project is related to guild wars, they won't close gw2. I base this assumption on the fact that gw1 is still very much open.
---
I just got tired of having 10 toons with partial story completion scattered over so many of them. I wanted to finally get the stories friggin done so I would better understand some of the things being said and backstory, heh.
---
&gt; ...weird enemy pathing and the movement total feels reaaaaally bad.
---
&gt; ...on land you are pretty fast, good animations and all of this and underwater just feels sluggish as hell.
---
I dont disagree with you on anything really. I tend to have different expectations for underwater combat vs land. So while its not a smooth or good as land I dont expect it to behave 1-1 the same way. Underwater isnt as good as land stuff but I think it gets an unfair amount of crap from players.
---
What about perma-chilled : ^ )
---
I can't seem to find tickets for the event on the website.. I hope they have tickets at the door that morning.
---
Any spec should be balanced by what risk-reward it offers.
---
Orca is a phone game though. It's gonna fail just as bad (or worse) as Diablo, IF that's happening.
---
&gt;a lot of timesink to learn rotations, mechanics
---
Then choose easy builds to learn. You also don't need to follow rotation videos to the letter. It's fine if you mess up, no one expects to be perfect.
---
That way, you can pay more attention to learning mechanics as opposed to learning the rotation.
---
&gt;I've started just setting aside five dollars a week to get carried through the raids that I'm interested in
---
Please no. Just... *Sigh*
---
I understand that it's your money and you have every right to spend it however you want to, but you should spend your money on something more tangible like something you can actually use irl than some abstract achievement in a video game, imho.
---
Yes it is normal to be in multiple guilds; max 5. Different guilds will have different rules. It's totally community driver. Don't feel comfortable, just leave there are tons of them. Also if you join ask for a tour and explanation of the Guild Hall.
---
If it's personal preference question: my pick is elementalist. I've not had any issues with anything listed
---
Guardian for maximum varied gameplay.
---
Necromancer for maximum open world faceroll.
---
Thief for maximum weeb.
---
the way it's done!
---
Except your argument falls short since I don’t think “GW2 is great” neither. I’m advocating constructive posts and “gaem is gr8t” is no better.
---
&gt; i bet 100% if someone said "game is great" you wouldnt say anything about semantics. you probably wouldnt say anything.
---
You should be the one to think about your thought process tbh. Your entire post is written off a baseless assumption about me and my position. It was not fun to read.
---
Gw didnt have gs. she was a warrior in the gw1 hero system so Jora as gs legend would work imo
---
Project Orca is a phone game? it won't compete with GW2 and there is no way they would shut servers down like that.
---
I prefer "Pacmander"
---
This is gorgeous
---
Ventari is technically Sylvari
---
Easiest way would probably be allow ground combat to be used underwater.
---
Rework underwater weapons and make them normal weapons which can be used on land.
---
I would much rather have an endurance mode where you have to fight through bosses that keep getting harder and harder with different instabilities. You get 3 wipes total and after those your wave gets reset to 0. Have some ranking of who has the highest wave and shit like that so there is some replayability
---
Ventari is a centaur...
---
Eh... it would be the best if it had collision. Unfortunately, without collision, it feels way too floaty.
---
Sometimes happening on me. Restarting pc does solve the infitinite loop of crash without any tweak.
---
Orr zones with Timberline Fall as a close second, every other map as a close third.
---
They're asking for a lot, sure when you read their page it sounds like a deal made in heaven but can they afford it? Even after all those layoffs? Or is it normal for US citizens to work for the bare minimum? Even with years of experience?
---
[Sure thing.](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vhAQNAR8cnsIClohFpBWpBcrhlUjq8DOhCo+Zj2rlcAKhAA-jxBFQBUUJ4kU/xO6GAwTAoE7PUFlfF4iAIKgAD-e) The build editor hasn't been updated with the most recent balance patch yet, but everything here is as indicated.
---
This build tears through anything. You can completely destroy any veteran, including all PoF hero challenges, in mere seconds; you won't finish casting your opening burst before it dies.
---
It has among the highest solo sustained DPS you can achieve in the current balance patch. None of its utilities except for its healing skill are required for damage, so the stunbreak and condi cleanse mantras give you extreme resilience; they are the most powerful defensive utilities you can take into open world/story instances.
---
Worked into the kit is a range of CC and defensive skills besides these mantras, and Mantra of Pain can easily be swapped to anything you want. Mass Invisibility is very useful now with its lower cooldown and longer stealth duration, but Gravity Well is still great for AoE CC and damage.
---
Even if all you do is camp greatsword at max range, like at world bosses, you still do fantastic DPS with a brainless rotation, the second-highest long range DPS in the game, behind a kneeling rifle Deadeye. You just keep the phantasm and skill 2 on cooldown, and double cast the phantasm with the signet when it's available.
---
But I said it wasn't faceroll, and that's true. You have to put in some time learning all the tools of the build, and when to apply them to protect yourself. However, a decent Chronomancer will be more survivable than a Minionmancer in any seriously dangerous content. I used a very similar build to clear the Queen's Gauntlet last time; sure, people clear it on any class, but Chronomancer made it so easy, because it has everything.
---
I promise, if you give it a chance, you will find it more survivable and higher damage output than a Minionmancer. It won't be instant, but give it some practice and learn its potential.
---
If my words alone don't sell you on it, check out [this demonstration video](https://youtu.be/N5aO9OOeTqU?t=124) of the build in open world. Everything in this video is accurate even to today; the build hasn't changed much at all. If anything, it's only gotten a bit stronger since.
---
mount maelstrom. I tp'd there trying to find the world boss and was like, can I climb the mountain? I *can*.
---
Sounds difficult to implement. Anet would never direct the resources to do this, not in one million years.
---
&gt; the Anet sucking off is cringeworthy. The guys are bad at their job and are being judged about it. Keep censoring this and all up are going to end up with is another situation where they are going to be mass fired and start wondering "omg why".
---
The streamer could turn off the sound from their discord leaving only their mics to the stream while still maintaining their discord presence and even comms. Many do.
---
What they ask and what they offer is all very typical for that industry.
---
I don't agree with your point that Elites should be upgrades.
---
I like elite specializations that habe a tradeoff and change how a profession is played. Exellent examples are Reaper and Scurge that both function in a different way than the core spec. You mentioned that reapers give up on range for more damage and that is in my opinion a good tradeoff.
---
Some of the recent tradeoffs however make me wonder what their plan is. While a specialization like Druid needs some kind of tradeoff I do not think that simply reducing the stats of the pet is the way to go. You can still play druid the exact same way you played your ranger and that is caused by a bad design. A better way to create a trade off was build into core revenant when they gave rev a skill that was only available to core rev and changed the flow of gameplay to be destinct from the elite specializations.
---
I cannot write this without adressing the most recent changes to Mesmer.
---
Again I don't think that the tradeoff was chosen correctly. The change to the shatter skills is so minor that the class itself does not feel different at all. The only thing that makes cheono feel different from mesmer now is the fact that you can not shatzer without illusions which - as many mesmers have stated - feels clunky and lackluster. A better tradeoff would have been to rework all 4 shatters completely and create a tradeoff like Reaper got. Something that does not only feel different bit actually IS different. A reaper like example would be: F1 instead of senlding out clones to explode on their target - Channel an AoE attack that scales with the number of clones you destroyed.
---
TL:DR - Good tradeoffs are Necro and Rev specs.
---
Improving a core profession is probably better than nerfing an elite spec. Tradeoffs should make the class play different, not make it less fun to play. Mesmer didn't get a tradeoff but a slap in the face.
---
They've had a new book UI since at least LS3's Head of the Snake... All of those blurbs are about the right size to be placed into those books. Oo
---
It's a technique called the travelling kiss pour. I use flotrol and one drop if silicone per color before I mix and pour :)
---
Although the evidence has been there for a while it's interesting to see them specifically list "designing systems that function well on a console" under essential duties, when combined with the qualification to "understand the design and technical challenges unique to MMOs".
---
All but confirms that they are working on a console MMO, whether that's a new IP or just GW2 on consoles.
---
That’s be the problem right there. Half of HoT enemies aren’t even good, they’re just broken to all hell.
---
You need more training I think
---
Finish all content with 2 guys? Go play Tibia lmao
---
I know this sub has mixed feelings about MightyTeapot but he is absolutely right in saying that the best way to get people into a game mode is to throw tons of them at it and hope some of them stick. Make story mode raids. Lock a mount behind raids. Lock *really cool skins* behind raids, maybe even outfits instead of putting them in the gem store. **Hell, put black lion keys as rewards to raids** just put something you can’t easily get anywhere else and make people play them so some of them stick.
---
5-1-1-1-1 thief get out of the way for 5-1-1-1-1 downstate necro Pog
---
I am sorry
---
I’ll still find a way to downstate to level 7 wolves in Queensdale, power of three elder dragons my ass
---
"We've decided to tailor our expensive development time to the wants of a single user who wrote a two thousand word screed on Reddit. Dreams do come true."
---
Hey I have nothing relevant to add here but I’ve seen you around the sub and holy shit I love your flair and I just read it out loud for the first time and realized it sounds like microtransactions and I’m cackling like a witch at 12:39 AM
---
Charr made her nervous and stopped.
---
But GW2 is not WoW. People play GW2 because it's not a raid focussed game
---
You got a genuine laugh out of me. +1
---
Yeah that was the thing when I first got into Guild Wars 2 PvP during esports and the D/D Celestial Elementalist meta. I knew it looked *cool*, I just had no idea what was happening.
---
And while you're sitting there listening to her sing her fellow villagers are getting kidnapped by the Krait :\\
---
Would love to see more of your comics, good job commander!
---
I do want housing, it's why I started playing ESO in the first place, I needed a game to scratch my housing itch. BUT stuff like housing and fishing obviously won't please the hardcore players so we need a lot more than.
---
Have the listings been up for awhile, or are these relatively new?
---
For what it's worth, I feel like you've been a bastion of sanity in this thread.
---
Thank you for reminding us that raiders don't really hate everyone else who just simply prefer different content, it's just a group of assholes who happen to be ultra toxic while being very loud about the fact that they raid.
---
I'm pretty sure you can unlock a new spec without additional HPs if you did most of HPs that already exist
---
OP just wants to show off their HPs.
---
There's so many extra already
---
That amount of HP means you have done world completion and done all HPs on the expansion maps and unlocked all elite specs 100%. There is nothing you can spend them on right now and elite specs cost 300 to fully unlock.
---
is this an out of season april fools joke?
---
Same
---
They should have a story mode like SWTOR since... A large chunk of story is now behind raids. That's the part that pisses me off the most; I don't even care about the mastery track.
---
 They can't do it like fractals since there's separate, different fractals that just go up by 1 each time.
---
Its just a box...   Snake!!!
---
You know if they add new elite spec, they will also add hero challenges to the new maps, enough for unlocking the new spec twice like in hot/pof?
---
OP forgot the Heroics Notary exists
---
We can hardly do that on our own character when we preview a new piece of armor, you want it on a creature?..
---
Nice catch, he definitely likes this kind of hints.
---
"If it's such a high priority why isn't it done yet?"
---
What do you mean neither party is willing to do what needs to be done?
---
I'm most emotionally attached to Queensdale (my first map), but I think my favorites would be Caledon Forest, Malchor's Leap, and Gendarran Fields. Just from an aesthetics viewpoint, Timberline Falls wins hands down, although I don't spend much time there ever.
---
There’s a reason I wrote “update underwater combat”, you know?
---
It is pretty fun. Damn shame Anet does not give a single fuck about pvp/wvw though.
---
All they care about is pushing out those new raids that like 10% of the players(if not less lol) actually about and story crap.
---
So much wasted potential...
---
Exactly. Especially that crafting lege is not a one day journey.
---
If you go crafting route, focus on things you cannot buy (mentioned gifts) and put some buy orders on TP. Gw2eff will keep track for you, so you don't have to remember how much do you need. From time to time just collect everything and see how total craft price steadily go down.
---
Someone I know on LinkedIn got hired at ANet and when I asked how it was working on GW2, he said he wasn't working on GW2, but a "Guild Wars title on PC".
---
No idea what that means but I've held out hope for like two years now.
---
That’s a useless PSA as you can not “waste” your hero points on anything.
---
Neither Anet nor their hardcores are willing to add additional difficulties. Right now hardcores are bored out of their minds and frustrated beyond redemption with Anet's one wing every seven months that's cleared in two hour. That's not raid content, that's bullshit. And casuals are alienated and excluded. That's just as much bullshit.
---
Instead of making raid development resources "worth it" by upping the playerbase of the developed content by 500% via lower difficulties, AND pleasing the hardcore crowd by 5000% by adding *higher* difficulties, Anet next to abandoned the mode.
---
[And raiders are basically clinically insane and happily cut their own nose off to spite their face.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ced50i/automatic_lfr_for_gw2_a_good_or_a_bad_idea/eu21nqg/)
---
So yeah, fuck 'em both. They deserve each other. Bring on the casual fun!
---
Amazon bought the table.
---
People in several discord servers often meme your posts and now I understand why.
---
Tell them I said hi! See you again 2020 for the next raid wing.
---
I don't really care what they give us so long as they're willing to work with it long-term.  
---
I don't even care if they give us more open world content so long as there's actually stuff in it for everyone.  Content for "everyone," is like going to six flags but telling all the adrenaline junkies that the big scary rollercoasters are out of service.
---
Wow, he sounded so jaded in that thread.
---
Not sure if annoyed at the community or realized that they weren't going to let him make any more fractal CMs.
---
I assume it has to do with how few in the community actually want difficult content.
---
No, i don't want to get better at reading newspapers.
---
No, he quit to work on Minecraft.
---
It definetly went over my head
---
One thing: Fractals proves you wrong.  T1 fractals exist and have all the fractals available to you be it Thaumanova or Shattered Observatory in scaling difficulties that award substantially smaller amounts of currencies and the like.  Easy mode raids (T1 in the suggestion), if I've read this thread correctly, won't allow access to the skins nor give out the currencies with a boss defeat.  It allows people to experience the mechanics in a less punishing way to get ready for T2, thus more people learn and more people feel confident that they can take on t2 or higher and the raid scene grows.
---
Because otherwise there is no point spending precious development time on something that no one will play. An only a tiny little fraction of players play raids just because they enjoy the difficult content, the rest plays it for rewards and what we want is more ppl into the raid, not less:-)
---
Perhaps only from the final boss of the wing, but not every boss.
---
They have some pretty awful Glassdoor reviews with a lot of the same complaints over a decent span of time, which makes them sound true. Seems like a pretty terrible place to work.
---
1. Actually from a technical PoV open world maps are also instances. Getting 50 people there isn't an issue, every DS meta does it.
---
2. If you have the mechanics toned down people aren't going to understand/learn anything of value anyway.
---
3. Nope. People would still expect to enter with a squad of 10 random builds and succeed, fail to realize what's wrong and give up. **Exactly** what happens in fractal CMs, which are that other piece of content with similar difficulty. You can very clearly see there playing their normal modes doesn't teach anything of value, precisely because the mechanics are so relaxed compared to the CM.
---
It only confirms they are hiring. Nothing there says it's mmo.
---
It’ll never happen so don’t worry
---
Is it possible to get into raiding seriously if I have a constant 300-400 ping? It's not really an internet issue, it's a location thing. Asking if there are other raiders here with high ping as well.
---
Man Alliance Battles were my jam in GW1. I loved them so much, the first time I ever willingly joined up with pug teams in a competive game. I'm normally so afraid of letting my team down. Not with AB though, best in my guild and highest ranked. WvW is fun but I do miss AB a lot.
---
I love all the Norn areas. I hate snow irl but everytime I'm doing map completion I do the Shiverpeaks first since they are my favorite.
---
i am playing raids don't worry.
---
no but i think it will take a lot development time. this time could be spent better on new things. GW2 was never a raid foccued game and never will be. the raid community is very small compared to other game like WoW.
---
&gt; this time could be spent better on new things.
---
Such as?
---
That's the power of online interaction. People can just drop whatever irl nonsense they got weighing them down and just PLAY. Really play like children do. No alcohol required either.
---
It's not exclusive to MMOs, but it happens there a lot more than most other places.
---
&gt; I mean, I know there's no official 2-man content in the game, but is there no content meant for more players that's doable by 2 man?
---
Almost all of the base game dungeon paths and also most fractals are doable solo or with two people. If you need help feel free to send me a private message and I can explain / show you how, I also have a lot of random dungeon-related videos from years ago and a few from recently as well if you fancy it. I actually do Arah dailies all 4 paths every day recently with my SO and it's very enjoyable. We play duo guard/guard most of the time.
---
Nothing like WoW. WoW is heavily gear grindy, our raids can probably be done in rares.
---
That being said they are top MMO despite how ancient WoW is, They're doing something correct.
---
It looks like Shatterer is eating the dirt and laughing about it. XD
---
You don't need to just be needlessly contrarian about everything, you know.
---
&gt; GW2 started without raids. it's not a raid foccused game.
---
This is irrelevant, raids were a huge selling point for the first expansion.
---
Ppl who play lower fracs mostly progressing their fractal/agony level (that mean it's not their intention to stay there once they are done), that is not the case in raids. Just look at a ratio of LFG for t1 and t4 during peak hours, it's like 10:1 and that is optimistic.
---
After you finish HoT and PoF story you get quests that give you an ascended weapon (choice between gs, dagger, sword, torch and sceptre; you can unlock all 5 skins though and get a 6th one for it; the quest is available starting from the daily reset after you complete the story, you will get a mail) and an ascended backpack, respectively. Elite specialization collections give you an ascended weapon as well, so focus on completing those as well. There are also other achievements (Dragons Stand collection, collection from PoF maps) that give you an ascended armor chest or weapon/armor recipe + ascended insignia/inscription used to craft armor/weapons (some of those can be completed for 15g by just buying stuff off of TP + you unlock some nicer looking skins). These are easy ways to gear your characters that also give you some nice skins along the way. You can 2-man most dungeons and some fractals, but honestly just use LFG to look for more people or join a fractal/raiding guild.
---
The issue is that the current GW2 player base is just bad at the game so unless you make it easy faceroll people won't engage with it.
---
A company saying they try to avoid certain things doesn't mean said things will never happen. It's pretty common to use terms like that instead of stating that particular outcomes will never happen.
---
It was 2+ years now, since last update to rewards in fractals. I am not saying they should something every major release, but 2 years? I mean, there is plenty of unused skins and recolors and effects that fits the fractal theme.. one way or another.
---
**What bothers let the tier 4?** There are people who like challenges, if you do not like, simple, enough just don't do them xD, but why remove? I found a great idea!
---
There's no list. Probably. That's ok. There are things that are "high priority," and they are working on those things, but don't want to talk about them because they want to hit it hard with a surprise announcement "hey, next week, Cantha!" 
---
Then there's everything else, everything else is low priority, because not everything can be high priority.

cdkeys is not an approved seller by the Lionguard and can lead to trouble if bought from. Just stick with the approved merchants so I don't have to come bail you out, recruit.

Personally i found wow to be a mediocre mmo. It's a good game, but nothing special. I think a lot of the games population is from factors other than just the game itself. It had a pre existing fan base from the warcraft games, was the first and only mmo that I've seen to launch a major tv ad campaign (night elf mohawk anyone?), and they used that popularity to suck in a lot of new players that never considered trying a mmo before. Now you have people with so many hours invested that they don't want to give up on it after spending all that time playing it.
---
If not for those out of game factors, I doubt it would have become more popular than the other similar mmo's released around that time. So yes, they did something right, but I think it was more amazing advertising than amazing gameplay.
---
But, that's just my opinion, I could be right or I could be wrong:)
---
Afaik he worked on new ANet project, after release of Shattered Observatory. Its not related.
---
i literally just mentioned the tea campaign.
---
and you didnt even need vpn (poland here too)
---
it's probably different at the start when, take bioware for example, you have 3  - 4 guys doing something they're passionate about and releasing stuff they actually want to play all the while getting paid for it.
---
&gt; While at it, if there is a way to also implement an automated LFG system that checks for various stuff as a requirement for that specific tier, that would be magical for the endgame in gw2.
---
wtf
---
go back to WoW!
---
Wouldn't this be breaking the law in your country?
---
jormag only manipulates the corrupt nature of mortals. he doesn't forcefully corrupt them and if you got a demon in your head and you can withstand it, you can probably withstand the influence of svanir too.
---
I don't where you meant specifically, but in the EU game development usually pays much more than business software programming. It does have more hours, but in a country with good labour laws, job security is just as assured.
---
Technically yes ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
No we don‘t need more purple weapons, there are wnough already. We beed some other colors like red or a nice cyian.
---
Timberline Falls because it reminds me of camping up in the Sierra Nevadas.
---
Full-time body collision would be nice, but I still think it's the best even without it.
---
What happened to Engi turrets?
---
Yes, though it would likely be ArenaNet's fault, not the player's
---
A lot of ppl seem to forget that guild wars 1 also got DoA, UW and (well.. ^^) FoW as difficult content. Even some dungeons needed casuals to prepare a little. 
---
There are solo clears for all this kind of content as well, I know.
---
But I wonder why no one was complaining back in those days.
---
Later I also started sc's alright... But as i really started in gw1 I had my casual guild in which we tried doing DoA in an organized grp in normal mode. Even in normal mode we failed a lot at the beginning. And I knew I would fail Soo hard trying stuff like this alone with only my heros.
---
We considered the elite areas to be very difficult content, like really. But no one was complaining or crying or saying "we wanna beat this content so plzz make it easier Anet." We just had our challenge. 
---
So we gathered and tried it again again and again, making slowly progress.
---
I also never saw a pug joining a DoA run via lfg with his casual ability, but no one was complaining very hard. So why was it so relaxed in gw1?
---
Same for me with gw2. I needed a long time to even get into fractals although I started with the gw2 beta... ^^. As I wanted to start raiding I saw the effort It needs with build preparation, knowing your class, knowing mechanics and a little bit of practicing how your dps rota works. So I just said "nah, that's not my content now"
---
There was still plenty of stuff to do in gw2. I mean the world of gw2 is huge. After a big break I  finally decided I wanted to start raiding. I had no guild to play with. Only pugs... I slowly got into fractals first and started looking for a pve guild. My first pve guild brought me slowly in my first cairn or Escort runs but most stuff I learned on my own joining training runs from time to time, watching videos to raid bosses and practicing with my chars.
---
(small Tipp, it also helps a lot to get your dps rota a little and playing dungeons. I did this with nearly every of my dps classes as well as support classes)
---
And if you only got 10, if you know your shit, all bosses, as well as your class in a raid. From time to time just ask the commander and the others politly to give you a chance, but take it serious! Sometimes there are also grps which don't even look for li and just say "know your shit" 
---
And big reminder to get this whole Roman to the end. You don't have to play this content at all...
---
Either you don't need to play it or you want to play it. But if you wanna play it just get your shit together and put a little bit of effort into it.
---
And yes, maybe you should just take a little time to find a guild which brings you into raiding. It's no big deal. In most cases you don't even have to represent them or play with them the whole day.
---
Then you shouldn't promote it.
---
At this point, I don't really feel like housing is right for Tyria. It's world is so open and dynamic and depends on players running around instead of sitting on housing plots. 
---
But maybe they'll surprise us.
---
You're 4 months late to an April Fool's joke, my friend.
---
Old but gold. One of my favorite creators, so sad he stopped so early :(.
---
You mean buttcapes?
---
&gt;well friend, the same patch that killed power Holosmith introduced several 36k+ DPS classes, condi and power.
---
which ones? Just curious.
---
Just to address your edit.
---
&gt; and yes this open world maps work very well for gw2.
---
Yeah that's why Anet revenue is declining and they just laid off a ton of staff - because the game is thriving atm.
---
&gt;players like farming events since 7 years now!
---
Speak for yourself, there was a lot of demand for more challenging content and a lot of people who gave up on the game did so because there was none.
---
&gt;why change this?
---
Arenanet have literally said they want to change it because it's too predictable.
---
They said S5 will be different and not the same forumula that the players are getting bored of.
---
&gt;if you don't like it leave and play another MMO.
---
Oh fuck off stop gatekeeping.
---
But what else would be new in expansion? It's basically a combo of a set of new elite specs and maps. We get maps as-is via Living World, so ... 
---
Also selling elite specs one by one would put a big stop to "let's make this elite crappier because we feel like it". Nerfed the chronomancer (or whatever replacement we'll have)? Your sales go into dumpster. Screwed engineers? No bonus for you. It'd actually be nice for a change. Because instead of _their_ ideas, they'd have to follow _what players want_. Right now all specs come in a package, so even if they screw up all but two elite specs, people would buy expansion just for those (and admit it, most core classes compared to newer specs suck really badly). But if everything gets decoupled... whoooo boy. Kinda like itunes did to music -- no more fillers for your CD, as people only buy hot singles.
---
I mean the sooner it's pointed out the sooner Anet will fix it. This is clearly an oversight.
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/
---
Only buy from one of those retailers.
---
It's not even a sign. Companies post career opportunities all the time, for two reasons:
---
* Building a database of potential employees, should they ever need them.
---
* Give an image of health, growth, and prosperity.
---
So this doesn't really mean anything. Not for ArenaNet, and not for any other company. It's neither good or bad. You can't really tell if they're really looking for people unless you're an insider.
---
Still, if anyone is interested, no loss at sending your portfolio, so go for it, even if the position you're interested in isn't even announced there.
---
LinkedIn is pretty important in software development in general, so go make a profile if you still don't have one.
---
[Turai Ossa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Turai_Ossa) seems like the natural choice. He lead the resistance against Joko's original conquest, defeated him and then became the first King of Elona in hundreds of years. He was also the Ghostly Hero that accompanied you through the ascension ritual in GW1.
---
All in all, Turai could've pulled off the whole renegade/war leader thing at least as well as Kalla and what with being a pretty integral character in Elona's and Joko's histories he would've fitted really well into the story and setting of PoF.
---
&gt;I didn't mean ALL content, I meant which content could be 2-manned or that lacked 3+man required mechanics. We consitently 2-man destiny 2 content meant for 3 players and even did the scourge of the past (6 man activity) just the both of us as it is the only raid that does not have a mechanic that requires 3+ players doing something simultaneously to clear an encounter.
---
I tried doing that for a while but found it rather hard to get a general look like the links provided here. It's much nicer to get the grid of all the armor sets and a photo of how they look for any given race inmediately than using the preview feature tbh.
---
[Anet's reply to a similar thread about CDKeys](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/72h9d0/someone_in_my_guild_linked_me_cdkeyscom_for/):
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;Please do not -.-
---
Chances are very high that you'll end up with a key bought from bank fraud (vendor steals credit card; sells you stolen code); then your account gets banned, Digital River flags you as a fraudster and does not want your money ever again... please, just... don't. Often you'll not be saving 5 bucks, you'll be spending 20 that then are gone for good.
---
ANY site that sells keys which are peer-to-peer suffer from this. I could also add others (who also sell gold sourced the very same way: Stolen bank accounts). Just don't, and I say this not because I don't want you to be smart about your money, but because I want you guys to avoid heartache.
---
Source: The players we ban because of fraud detection. :(
---
As for sales: On a newly released product these will be rare - in these cases waiting a few months will eventually bring a legit sale. Also, keep your eyes open on special offers during the upcoming holiday season. A few years back Target offered 50$ Gem cards for 40$ on a specific day, for example.
---
I don't think it's too different from other videogame development companies in general. The whole industry is a mess, investors give the corporate managers way too much freedom, there are no strong unions, etc.
---
If you're into software (programming, databases, etc) you have many other industries with better conditions out there. It's sad, but that's how it works.
---
Well no. They said they don't want to do the "one map with every episode" thing anymore and I'm glad they do. I hope they go the DryTop / Silverwastes approach and give us big maps that reveal more areas over multiple episodes or even expand older maps with new areas.
---
sometimes i'd rather have them take half a year, just to work on qol, buildtemplates, reworking rewards, making the raid tier system that we saw being suggested and things like that, before having them work on story, new achievements or so
---
ok
---
And how is WildStar doing today? Oh, wait.
---
Housing was great there, yeah, but so was their other actual gameplay content. And that was abandoned as development ceded.
---
&gt; Well no. They said they don't want to do the "one map with every episode" thing anymore and I'm glad they do.
---
hey can you give me a source / link to this? thx
---
if your only concern is to look at your own character, the camera options should provide a solution.
---
Do you use invisible bags?
---
I agree, it's really sad when the community has better ideas than the devs. The worst part is that none of these will ever get implemented.
---
Is it in a invisible bag? That prevents it from selling
---
You have a point. I would love that, but if it's gonna be a main thing I doubt anyone will like that. It's definitely not one of those "contents" that involves gameplay and all that.
---
That said, you could argue it's like fashion where you just do it because it's fun and it's a way to show off that you're rich you know. Fashion may not be an actual endgame content despite the memes, but people sure as hell are invested in it.
---
To be honest, most of those maps barely count as content.
---
me? no
---
Tengu reveal pls Anet
---
Equipment dyeing should be a thing
---
GW2 is subfree, just spend your money on ESO housing and play GW2 on the side. Its how you are supposed to do that afterall, according to this subreddit and the forums.
---
I started out like you. Didnt like the combat system of ESO at all, its so much inferior. The builds are all pretty much the same and making alts is a pain, the horror for someone like me. But ESO has more dungeons and raids, and friends started playing it. So I bought the game, tried it, and now I spend only about 6 hours per week in GW2 (4 hour raiding with my static, rest is login time to do some dailies) and the rest of my gametime in ESO.
---
Ive stopped hoping for Anet to develop the game "for me". Ofc, the direct consequence is that Im not spending any more money on GW2. 
---
If you keep hoping for things that Anet didnt announce, you will make yourself crazy with the constant disappointment.
---
There's other important information at the top, usually your target.
---
Zoom out if you want a batter look at your character. I almost always always play zoomed out all the way
---
Cute.
---
&gt;I agree, it's really sad when the community has better ideas than the devs. 
---
having nice ideas it's not even a tenth of the workload needed to be done to add this stuff, you know?
---
Ah thanks, that was it!
---
I would rather them work on actual content and not something that exists as a gold/material sink.
---
Dang it, these will look sick on my purple necro! Wish they make weapons dyeable!

So basic questions here, just started playing the game and am about to hit lv 20.    
---
    
---
In my charcater/hero menü I can train certain skills for my necromancer. Which ones do I go for and why? And are they resetable?
---
you should never take glassdoor 100% seriously
---
On par with - PSA: Don't uninstall the game if you want to play the new season.
---
Here's a crazy thought... Some work is significantly more important than other work.     
---
A creature codex falls squarely in the realm of high effort/low value.
---
we all saw it lol
---
Not sure why but concept art always looks wwaaaaaaaayyyy better
---
No surprise that the Incel wouldn't like Taimy either, as she is female as well. What's your problem dude?
---
Buy from dlgamer. Expansions are always on sale there for lowest price.
---
Guild wars 2 survived on little to no content for years and quarter expansion PoF got high praise while offering nothing substantial. Half assed housing goldsink will fit game like a glove.
---
Nah, even a cursory glance at your username and post history says otherwise.
---
I don't think buying rng boxes is illegal, providining them is
---
All I want are those fractal armor skins.
---
What's wrong with an easy mode?
---
&gt;But unless you can prove you're an expert -- whether that means you're just starting out or didn't have the opportunity -- game development will pay better.
---
That's some pretty terrible short-term planning. If you want to be stuck with the same salary forever, and be fired once the irregular project cadence strikes the company's income, then go for it, but you'll never grow your career.
---
I love videogames and I've worked on mods and indie stuff, but always as a hobby. My job might not be as fun, but I got a better salary and, pretty important, work stability.
---
&gt; Also, the jobs you described wouldn't be filled by a programmer, they were higher qualification jobs requiring a software engineer or technical expert.
---
No one gives a shit about degrees, most university students are useless, and easily outpaced by "less qualified" workers. Companies want competent people who know how to code, they don't want idiots who know about outdated stuff they memorized from outdated books.
---
Wherever you go, you're pretty much guaranteed to be given a learning period, some with even actual in-house training. Most of what you learn in school is useless, the companies want competent people, they don't give a damn about your paperwork, they want you to do the job.
---
so true. nearly ever part of the game needs dev time. it would be better for the whole community if the focus on that instead of creating a new construction side.
---
You could just contact A.Net about it, you know.
---
because 
---
1) underwater combat is in no way good enough for an entire season to be based around it and systems or reworks to make aquatic combat good is just to much work to get ready during season 5
---
2) just because dragons are asleep doesn't mean they're not a threath (see scarlet, svanir, Drakkar and the great destroyer)
---
Tier 1 \o/
---
Skiing through long winded ice tunnels that also benefit from the roller beetle...
---
It's on the same level as sharing exploits in my opinion. Reddit isn't the place for that.
---
&gt; The main issue I see from this is that it introduces mechanics that distract you from the real fight.
---
This is my exact problem with fractal instabilities. They are just annoying pita, and doesn't provide me fun. This is why I never went further than T1 :D
---
There are other bigger more important issues and features that need implementing before doing stupid shit like player housing.
---
Yeah he and passero made really funny gw2 shorts
---
Nowadays i watch silverdisc, noxxi, noody and lord hizen for some funny content if that helps, check them out :)
---
I get that you want it but it doesn't make sense since they have 0.1% presence in the game and their addition to the game would have no impact since they would be charr 2.0 the least played race in the game. Sadly its a waste of resources on the other hand awakened would be an easier fit, that would take much less resources but it's also something would never ever happen.
---
It's really hard to translate concept art into 3D models that look equally good. Many more angles it can be viewed from, design limitations, etc.

&gt; There is actually an app/website called Tyria3D that was able to render a great number of things from old dat files that never quite made it into GW2 for any number of reasons.
---
How come I never heard of this :o I checked it out now, and it's great!
---
GW2 is still the more successful game, and people had enough problems with GW1 as well. You just have to take off the nostalgia goggles to see it.
---
From a player POV maybe but given the possible revenue gains from housing IMO it should be almost imperative for Anet.
---
Ded
---
I used to play the game a few years ago but quit, now I wish to come back but there is one problem: I have no idea where to start looking so I can re-learn how to play and how to guide my actions towards a smooth playthrough. I remember loving to explore the areas and doing story related content, but I don't really know the order in which I should proceed and what is important to the story and what can be considered "fluff".
---
Last but not least, I also remember dying a lot, so going for some sort of build that can survive seems like a good Idea. My main character was a Norn Warrior 2h Sword, which I remember enjoying the skills. I was at the start of the jungle expansion regarding the jungle Dragon, Just after saving the stranded crew.
---
Appreciate any help, thanks in advance.
---
But how will I make people go blind
---
Only other option besides zooming out would be hiding your HUD altogether, there is a command /key combination in the settings. But it will be hard to keep track of your life and CDs if you try to actively play like this ;)
---
You know the usual. Stack infusions, permafrost armor, fractal backpack, be charr with pink hair
---
Skyscale is very useful... for swapping to Griffon with extra height. :D
---
I get that, all I'm saying is, it shouldn't be like that. People shouldn't feel entitled to new content just because it is a certain genre. In my opinion, you pay 60 dollars for the product you're paying for at that moment, and any updates are extra.
---
Hey guys, don't misunderstand me - I think getting new colours and reskins is great.  I would love to see even more sets of new colours for a variety of weapons added into the game. 
---
What I really don't want though is for them to slap a "NEW CONTENT!!" sticker on this crap and ship it to us as the only content we get once a year.   Especially knowing how 'cheap' it is from a labour perspective vs having to design a completely new weapon set, by now we could/should have a TON of different colours available for different sets.  But instead these 're-colours' get released to us over the course of 1-2+ years re-branded as 'new content' when I know it doesn't take that long to release a simple re-colouring when the model itself already exists.
---
I'm afraid we'll show ANet that we're content with this pattern of things; just imagine 5 years from now do you want to look back and the only thing you have to show for it is, "oh look i have silver, gold, purple, blue, and red colours of the exact same fractal skin."
---
OP is suggesting the games dead? Lol no, no
---
hahaha get? The game is dead! And this is a graveyard. When you're dead you will be put into a graveyard.

If it wasn't for reddit I would'nt even know that people consider this game dead

don't forget the white fur

Dude, if anet announced today an expansion with new raids, fractals, pvp tournamente, wvw rework and other currently neglected stuff, they would storm the shop forpreorders, nobody said content should be free. But anet doesnt want to sell content.

Nice video but how do you zoom out far away?
---
My guess is if you ask non players what they think/know about gw2, their first answer will be FaShIoN wArS
---
:D
---
They've taken 2 years to just chill out and do not much, they really need to put *something* out now so players have something new to do.
---
PoF launched 22 months ago, in the time since, despite the promises of 'no content drought', they've nearly finished 1 living world season, added some raids, and totally neglected everything else. We know there's no expansion coming, I don't think the game will survive another 2 years of a single map every 4 ish months. 
---
Now is most certainly *not* the time to pause things, now is when we should be seeing all the things they've been spending the gemstore cash on.

What p+f in T4 fractal LFG stands for?
---
more fractal anything would be nice at this point
---
No. Raids are way to easy as it is
---
As long as it's not the same UI as guild hall decorations...
---
This is a complete strawman argument. Wildstar has plenty of issues that had nothing to do with housing. Other games that offer housing are more successful.  Housing won't make or break a game, one way or another.
---
I'm willing to wager that a larger percentage of the playerbase will get more time out of a new story/zone than than would out of a new raid. You may not like that that's true, but it's probably true. I spend many many many hours (hell days and weeks) in most new zones.
---
Meanwhile I am being cussed at for asking questions and being removed from squads for not fully understanding champion mechanics.
---
If it wasn't for the quality of design of the game, I most likely wouldn't be playing.
---
Actually, the housing was very good in WS, and was actually popular and profitable.
---
The game had a lot of other issues. ANet should ninja it tbh - owned by NCsoft wasn't it?
---
Am more hyped for my FF14 download to finish than for any GW change, they made me disappointed so many times that I just lost any kind of trust in them. Loved this game, still love it, I just hate the people who ruined it

wow this is such an insanely bad idea lol
---
you don't even explain how exactly do you think it will
---
&gt; Simple, they handle what splits communities apart. Regulations do not offer a place for disagreements to arise.
---
wtf does this even mean? 
---
like not only is your idea bad and others explained why it's bad and you still insist it's not..what is there to gain from this system?
---
Wish they had kept this in the game. They should bring it back and advance it into a full library for book and lore collectors. My  Durmand Priory character is a major collector of books but has no library to put his collection. wish the devs would finally make it an item in the home instance or something

It’s unfortunate that every other part of ESO feels so stiff and wooden.

---
We need districts back, for both PvE and WvW. Maybe even add districts for non-supported languages as well, because even if the game isn't available in, say, Italian or Russian, there's still quite a handful players from those regions, and they always feel lost and alone when they log in, since they have no way to find their communities ingame.
---
Hell megaservers already did enough damage to many French, German, and Spanish players, and I'd wager a handful of them quit when they couldn't find anyone speaking their languages.
---
Or if their chosen issue is a high priority, but takes longer to implement, they'd complain when a lower priority item gets done firsf
---
Games need more purple, period.  There can never be enough.
---
Customizable UI would solve sooo many problems, but whatever :I.
---
I'm not sure what you mean no one was complaining. There were certainly some complaints, though not as many. Then again, Guild Wars wasn't really a casual game all the way through. People who didn't "get" how to play didn't stay nearly as long. It was better at weeding out people who wanted to basically do nothing.
---
Guild Wars 2 didn't do that. This game made it possible for people to get through content and get to max level without pressing any key but one for most of their journey. Most of the time they didn't have to dodge. They didn't have to break bars. They didn't have to combo. These were things that have been in the game for a long time, but the game doesn't require them for most encounters.
---
If you take the core world and then you add in something like HoT, of course you're going to get complaints, in the same way that if you took a bunch of sixth graders and put them in tenth grade.
---
Self-starters and people who do research did fine in HoT. I did fine in HoT. Hell, I loved HoT, but a decent percentage of my casual guild had to be dragged through HOT, kicking and screaming.
---
The game does a pretty poor job of teaching people who aren't self-starters, who don't do research, who don't visit websites how to play.
---
Ventari is a Centaur but he's tied pretty closely to the Sylvari lore.
---
I love [Cursed Shore](https://youtu.be/GAg6DSzwSsw). I made a short film as a love letter to the devs. Exploring the hell out of the map was a happy time.
---
It'd also be nice if we could right-click to lock characters in their position. So, for instance, my main would always be in the first spot even if I played another character more recently.
---
Maybe where you're from, in the more bureaucratic parts of Europe, it's either degree or no job
---
&gt;No one gives a shit about degrees, most university students are useless, and easily outpaced by "less qualified" workers. 
---
Depends on the nature of the work. Typical business software developer? The difference is negligible because the work is quite simple. Working in something like a top bioinformatics lab? Or being part of a R&amp;D team for a company in pretty much any field? You absolutely will see a difference, so much so that those companies won't even look at you if you don't have a degree.
---
&gt;  they don't want idiots who know about outdated stuff they memorized from outdated books. 
---
It's a good thing that the foundations of computer science haven't changed for a very very very very long time then.
---
&gt;Most of what you learn in school is useless 
---
This realllllyyyy depends on the job. I use the "useless" stuff I learned throughout my CS education on a daily basis.
---
I dont think pvp in guildwars 2 is that good for a newcommer. If you dont get a build online your fucked . If you dont know the anymations on what skills to doge your fucked. You cant learn anything in the 5v5 coz you get insta bursted. If you pick a hard class to play your fucked . The only reason why 5v5 is remotly balanced is becase if there is a op class you can focus it and kill it but that does not mean classes are balanced
---
Pedantry. It was pretty obv what he meant.
---
5/7 truly wonderful art.
---
What’s the point of skins other than looking pretty?  Collect. Decorate. Feel a sense of engagement with the game.
---
Because the constant purple crystal stuff we've been getting isn't already tiresome...
---
Yeah, I’m really tired of the PoF character select theme and music. I would really like if we could just choose a theme (core, PoF, HoT). As another person suggested, I also think we should be able to put our characters in a custom order. 
---
In short, the character select is in need of an update.
---
Those look like they're mix of Fractal and [Tormented](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tormented_weapon_skins) weapons.
---
Wouldn't mind that, could be a set obtained from CM boss fractals once more get added since they have a sinister look to them. But what I want now is:
---
* Golden backpieces (capacitors and Ad Infinitum)
---
* Fractal armor
---
Making them bigger and in two rows would be nice for old guys like me with slower brains.
---
Just call the easymode raids "10-man story dungeons" and i am sure they'd be perceived much better.
---
no new elite unless u buy expac3 for LS5 anyway so it doesnt matter
---
I do what I want
---
Hold up. I do explain it if you read further than that sentence.
---
Just got a glyph of volatility. I'm a casual player. Should I sell for the quick buck or use?
---
Or both. A duel legend would be cool.
---
Follow up. You will be expected to use them and appropriately for fast or easily managed clears.
---
One guy built a roller beetle track in his guilt hall. Play an MMO with a race track and we will talk later.
---
i'm sorry for the special snowflakes who consider rude to be told the truth. a game which is 18 years old has an old gameplay, an old interface and the limits of an engine which is 18 years old. 
---
Maybe they wil enjoy, i enjoy retrogame too, but will be a pain to be played. don't forget dodge does not exist, mounts are not that good like the ones we have here.
---
if u cannot see any diffence beetween this and that well i'm sorry but it's the truth.
---
Wow I like this idea.
---
it's just retrogame.
---
it's just retrogame. nothing more nothing less.
---
If you need the gold sell, otherwise use. Pretty sure you can find threads saying how much is the glyph worth while per gather.
---
"No dodges"
---
Imagine that on a raid where mirage or daredevil is meta.
---
My pleasure!
---
I see Cantha, I downvote. 
---
Been playing for 12 years between GW1 and GW2. I want to see NEW SHIT, not retread the same old shit.
---
A preview window big enough for Charr would be a great start
---
&gt; Elite: "I Am the Strongest!" - 90s cooldown elite. Gives 25 stacks of might for 25s, plus fury and quickness for 10s, and removes weakness. Also gives a new effect that prevents boon removal, named something like "Safeguard", for a shorter time than those boons, like 5s or so.
---
That sounds like cancer.
---
Probably should've played through the game instead of using your level 80 boost
---
&gt; 0 new pve game mode were released since the launch. 
---
Assuming you mean PvP game modes, Stronghold was released since launch.  It went over like a lead balloon, but they tried.
---
All of that is subjective, except for that GW2 is a bigger commerical success. To me GW1 feels super shallow, heroes can carry you, story relies mainly on retcons and plottwists. It really isn't that good. The world is also a ton less diverse, there's basically humans and that's it.
---
Well I agree with you in your point "gw2 doesn't teach anything to the players"
---
But there's also a huge community behind the game which supports new players a lot.
---
But sometimes players just don't want their help.
---
Instead they want stuff easier. I read it every week on reddit. Players complaining about raids beeing to difficult. Don't talking about this post, there're people which are really complaining.
---
It's also the same like people complaining about sekiro beeing to hard and want an easy game mode. Yes, sekiro is hard, you knew that before you spent money for it.
---
So there's content made for players which want to have it a little harder. But we had this before.
---
You don't need raiding at all. Ppl who play raids do it because they want a challenge and not because they wanna play raids.
---
If you don't want a challenge, don't play raids
---
More or less.
---
not sure language is the issue tbh
---
It took me about 20 mins to do, you could always park an alt there and let them teleport when they catch up.
---
It's soloable, but having more people helps with clearing/aggroing mobs. I think that all rune-locked doors stay open when you finish the whole "mini dungeon" so that makes it even easier for others to complete with teleports/portals.
---
When I started two months ago my account name was just a series of numbers. They changed it for me and to this day those numbers still come up at times instead of my account name. The issues with people trying to add me at least have gone away
---
I started playing ranked and placed gold-3... quit like a week later. You end up playing with the same pool of like 50 people if you are on a regular work schedule. And that’s not even high level play. I heard when you get to low plat, the population is so bad that you have to play against the best of the best that are frankly far outclassing you
---
Honestly it might've been the right call. Stronghold is a terrible MOBA copy, and probably unfixable. It never should've been made in the first place, but at least they stopped investing resources into it after the flop. Unfortunately they never really tried anything ever again..
---
It's a business, not your friend. If it's no longer fun, then shed a tear and move on. They will never do what the players want them to do if it goes against their goal of making a profit. Just enjoy is as much as you can for as long as you can and move on.
---
Which transformation potion/tonic is this?
---
I yiess you are right. I still dont know why they never went with true gvg instead.
---
The story is as follows
---
Core game-&gt;living world season 1-&gt;season 2-&gt;Heart of Thorns-&gt;season 3-&gt;path of fire-&gt;season 4. None of it is really what I'd consider "fluff", but season 2 is probably the least interesting season available, and season 1 is not available anymore to play.
---
In a month, we're going to hear about season 5 which comes after season 4. 
---
For a basic guide, maybe check out the returning player's guide on the sidebar of this subreddit. It might help you out with what you need
---
As for builds, check out metabattle for your needs. A lot of surviving in this game is not just your build, but your own ability to play, and Heart of Thorns will punish you, regardless of your build, for sloppy gameplay.
---
Try some mobile games with auto play option, it will save you from the excruciating experience of..gameplay?
---
I know what you're saying and I know you want to be ranged, out of the crowd, and GW2 is casual but not that casual. It would work for Open World, but you would be at a significant disadvantage in Fractals and Raids. And purposefully doing that is going have you on teammates shit list.
---
I've always disliked the human gods. They're super boring to me, and as every non-human race it doesn't even feel that relevant or as threatening as prior villains.
---
Mmm... Buttcapes...
---
I guess yeah for people who aren’t playing that race it could seem detached - what sort of content would you have preferred to see?
---
You know you can make a custom soundtrack, right?
---
Sorry we found FFXIV Shadowbringers
---
As someone else said, they might change the cost of those boxes. But here's the [gw2efficiency](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/zephyrite-supply-boxes) page showing the (old) price per box. I'd assume that it will be updated if they change the amount of materials needed.
---
And... how is this any related to Guild Wars?...
---
You sneaky devil ;D
---
Why not perma-slow too and name it:
---
420 =&gt; Boss smokes to much.
---
It actually looks good. 
---
Another thing is better lighting. :D
---
S5 is Steve Bubbles confirmed?
---
well I mean you can see a human female. That's pretty much GW2 right?
---
I can't find any HPs. Must be an error.
---
Nooo    why are events always on EU
---
what the actual fuck.
---
I think the correct title would be "*Get some Hero Points, if you don't have enough yet*".
---
No and heres why its literally in your title. NCSoft Internal Development Studios and of course this is in Korean. GW1 and 2 are Anet games yes NCSoft publishes it or did up until 2015 I'm not sure if they have taken back over publishing but when Anet started self publishing we had to sign up to a new EULA with zero NCSoft references in it so if they take back over publishing we'd have to accept another EULA with NCSoft being inserted in it. I highly doubt NCSoft would take the GWs IP off Anet to make another game Anet is really independent. Chances are its a new NCSoft game based on possibly a modern version of Lineage but highly highly doubtful its anything to do with GW unless its made by Anet.
---
Needs more underboob, can't be GW.
---
Is there a way to track gold-&gt;gem prices? I hate having to refresh the tp window all the time to find a nice time to get some gems.
---
Everybody loves big chests.
---
That guys poor dinky.
---
Stronghold was PvP's Hindenberg.  It was anet being reckless and over-confident as usual.
---
One of NA's biggest pugmanders announced he's quitting yesterday.  So many hardcore guilds quit within the last 6 months.  At this rate, NA WvW is going to die before alliances are even a thing.  I fear soon it's only going to be ktrainers or people who are just there for Gift of Battle left.  Really disheartening to see.
---
&gt;and you think the players will become better by introducing super easy raid modes? lol
---
No I don't and I never said I did. I'm a WoW raider (or used to be) I know exactly what LFR is and how it doesn't work to prepare anyone for higher difficulties. 
---
Honestly there is little to nothing in this game for hardcore raiders and I'm surprised that the player base has managed to hang on for so long.
---
I just want to be able to make my own groups....
---
"Mains"
---
"Node alts"
---
"Mules"
---
etc
---
Just wondering but why got this post tagged as a spoiler? I thought that the limit is 28 days after release.
---
Here's my idea how to rework raids:
---
delete them! focus again on fractals and open world content.
---
GW2 was never meant to have raids. it worked very well til HoT. there was no need for raids.
---
and now thanks to raids people here trying to turn this game into a fucking WoW copy with LFR bullshit.
---
The only thing random here is you.
---
I take it, that you don't watch the thursday dev streams. At late as last thursday they talked about some of the struggles they have had to overcome for alliances and also confirming that they are still working on it.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbrOR5j0Als
---
you can not build something like that in GW2 ;)
---
Yes. Im sure they are working very hard on it.
---
Meh.  Let us dye our weapons.  Make some new dyes only available in fractals/pvp reward tracks/raids/whatever activity you prefer.  Make those dyes sellable on the tp. Get rid of duplicate skins created only for recolors.  If a skin needs to be reused for some reason, give it more dye channels or retexture it.
---
Is that a map has been in beta longer than some full games have been in alpha
---
I do agree on that part; some other missions I remember getting to be more involved in the maps; I really liked the Vabbi one but desolation I kinda just breezed through.
---
#
---
&gt;Too much wasted space
---
Yes, we need GW2 to look more like a website from the mid 90s, that was a good look. ^(/s)
---
No Cantha expansion please
---
And we're acting like this is brand new information we haven't been aware of all this time why exactly? City of Heroes, Dungeon Runners, does any of it ring a bell?
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/join-us-for-a-special-live-event-on-august-30/
---
No.
---
Ye coz core Tyria teachs you so much.
---
Look how many people stand at world bosses and autoattack in random gear, Half of them don't know what a breakbar is.
---
If you want to learn stuff in this game, you have to go out of your way to do it.
---
if we only had technology to CHANGE ALL CHARACTERS TO DEFAULT :(
---
Accurate.
---
[removed]
---
No one plays wow anymore. Everyone is waiting at the station untill the classic train arrives. BFA kinda killed WoW as it has dipped under FFXIV according to a couple of sources, having played BFA I can totally believe that.
---
They never recreated the UI. Only very few parts are done using CoherentUI.
---
Namely the patcher, the trading post, most of the guild house related windows, the pvp score summary and the book window.
---
CoherrentUI would be way too slow to be used for the entire UI due to it beeing heavily CPU based.
---
That’s a good point. Customizing our character portrait would be a nice add as well.
---
Here you can observe the gw2 bandwagon downvoting a thread to hell cause its not pvp, wvw and raids.
---
I do. But that does nothing to change the theme or order that our characters appear in.
---
Enough purple stuff, please.
---
What's wrong with you
---
Did it hurt? Pulling so much shit out of your ass.
---
the buildings in the guildhall were already there.
---
on the wildstar housing plot everything was build by the players itself! everything! that's a huge difference
---
Keyboard handling is possibly the most hard-to-get-right area of TacO, I've spent months on research and am still not closer to a good solution that both catches the necessary keys and doesn't mess up keyboard input for GW2. If TacO was in the GW2 process (such as inside of a directx dll) that would change things on this front, but I decided against doing that in the end to keep the overlay on the most compliant side of things.
---
I'll look into the broken bindings, for now you can try removing the bindings from the config file by removing all the keyboardkey_* entries.
---
I did not know how much I wanted this until now.
---
Not dead but not the juggernaut it used to be. Shell of its former self, I'm going to guess classic wow will have a bigger player base than current wow.
---
I'm not usually mean about this sort of thing but he really was. There was an event for the first expansion, everyone was hyped and his comments were disrespectful to with a slight hint of trying to be edgy.  
---
He helped extend the negative stereotype of MMO players
---
True! Sounds stupid af. It is a new “throwaway” account after all. Guess all I can say lets look at this post in a vacuum. Damn I might seem like a hypocrite now, oh well...
---
Implying living story has as much content and has the quality of Witcher 3.
---
Many servers are already marked as being full with players that don't log in anymore.  
---
If they dumped them and gave them a pass to join a not full server in the future, it would probably become the next WvW bandwagon exploit.
---
True for most stats combos, unless there are multiple combos with the same stats but different values.
---
If I filter by Power/Precision/Ferocity, I'll get berserkers (power main stat) as well as assassins (precision main stat).
---
There are other live games with better longevity. It’s not unreasonable to want that same longevity in GW2.
---
No, nature doesn't beat Bob Ross!
---
Why not??
---
Faulty logic.  
---
This assumes knowing better than Anet and all of the quiet players who don't come here to Reddit to demand their rights.
---
I'm still waiting for the golden Ad Infinitum.
---
I’d wager that a large percentage of the player base logs in for the story then after a few days stops playing until the next chapter.
---
In the end we'll just get a personalizable chair
---
Maybe. Probably. Almost definitely.
---
We know that it's not going to be about a world-ending threat, that's all. Some hope we may spend the season tieing up loose ends and plot threads. But the pictures so far heavily imply snow and cold. Assuming it's not a red herring, we may go to the Far Shiverpeaks and deal with Jormag.

Hey, I tried to keep my name in Iron-legion naming policy D:
---
Well the human gods were most likely at least on par with the Dragons, if not only slightly weaker, cause the reason why they left tyria instead of fighting the dragons was that their battlr would have most likely ripped the realm apart. (Or they would have lost and their magic would reign free, or they lost and the elder Dragon magic ran free. It was basically no win situation.)
---
break from human lore
---
Spend 5 minutes in Mistlock Sanctuary, and yeah it kind of feels like that sometimes.
---
How exactly is playing through core tyria going to solve all that?
---
Is core Tyria going to tell him to rebind his keys? No.
---
Is core Tyria going to tell him what to do once he hits 80? again, no.
---
You have to learn these things on your own, boost or no boost.
---
Or have a Dropdown box to choose sorting, like with achievements:
---
* Custom: Manually arrange their order.
---
* Last login: The order we already have.
---
* Story progress: More story completed to the left
---
* Map completion progress.
---
* Age: Characters with birthdays farther away to the left, so you get first the ones with birthdays already passed.
---
* Level
---
* Location: Location name listed alphabetically. 
---
Then a checkbox to invert the order.

Dude its supposed to be a joke from all the whining

I would like to see one day a video like this, but playing [Winners by Pet Shop Boys](https://youtu.be/6AEO21i-oN0).
---
The funniest thing is that they not even try to speak their language. I have seen it so many times in my own native language. Ppl are trying to speak english because they think they have to before they start to speak their own language and immediatly receiving answers. It is a matter of perception.
---
If you don't have elite specs unlocked yet you basically just want to go a build with a lot of aoe damage. Shatter builds work quite well. Basically you generate 3 clones and then use the flat damage shatter. For pve I would recommend going with a power build over a condition damage build. Sword and scepter are both great for this (scepter is also good for condition damage, but the 2 skill does really high power damage, and the 3 generates 2 clones at once so it's good for both).
---
For off-hands focus is generally very good because of its ability to pull enemies together, making your shatter hit all targets at once.
---
Your utilities are a bit flexible, so play around and see what you like. Mirror image is a good choice for the double clones, and blink is just a very nice quality of life skill.
---
Hope that helps!
---
you should look a bit on the history. the 3 founders of arena net where big guys in blizzard and had enough money.  
---
they simply sold their company to get even more money (15,5 million $).  
---
later on they were Jeff Strain and Patrick Wyatt got CEO at ncsoft west before leaving and founding another game studio, undead labs.  
---
now undead labs is bought by microsoft and while jeff stain strain is still there, Wyatt  is some CEO at amazon.  
---
like...those people have money dude. its not about who funded years of x development. its about how to get fucking money out of a company.
---
Off the top of my head: VR, CF, WE, BOO, MM.  All in varying states of hiatus or in some sort of turmoil because their leaders are burned out.  I'm sure there are quite a few more I'm forgetting.  Also a lot of guilds aren't rallying the numbers that they used to.
---
A tinge of common sense would tell him to rebind is keys. I don't know if you actually read my comment, but nowhere did I suggest he learn everything from core. The sidebar and wiki are more than helpful, he's just a help vampire at this point.

With all seriousness: I hope alliances never happen, because it will be the last straw on the camel's back that is my WvW enjoyment. I love my server with all its variety: fight guilds, community guild, semi-casual and family-like guilds, dozens of cool individuals that simply don't join a guild. Most of people I know will end up scattered and lost if Alliances come. So I'm genuinely hoping they get cancelled. What a selfish prick, downvote me for still caring about server identity.

One person having access to the rooms works for teleport to friend. I have done the same thing for a friend who needed it for skyscale.

Except that anet has managed to keep players interested for 6 years. Yes, I think an mmo's goal should be to keep players interested for a long time, certainly longer than games like the witcher 3, but it can't keep players going indefinitely. At some point, you're just done with the game.

The Wings of the Sunless are still obtainable when you use a guaranteed wardrobe unlock. So you can still get it in a way. I try to list up things that are completely unobtainable right now. But you are right, it's a nice backpiece for necros.

Good point, idek been so long haven't had a comp for about 4 months, just remember really enjoying the exploring, fractals ( I think they are called) and when mounts came out was a blast, open world bosses were pretty lit too

That's the stereotype, and servers as they were in 2012/2014/whatever earlier year are indeed dead, but new communities are formed and new dedicated individuals still appear. I myself joined WvW only in 2017, and ever since grew to know and cherish my server's population. Some people/guilds move around or quit, but there's still a living core.
---
I mean, if you already experienced leveling, I would say just boost, being level 80 means you are able to do all the content in the game, even that of level 1
---
and you get leveling tomes as candy these days, boosters are not worth that much nowadays
---
Found the guy on BG. Literally the only server to not get fucked by the Locust Shitters Alliance.
---
I just read on another one u get leveled to the areas so I'm using it now :)
---
I kinda agree, all "pride" people already left the game, alliances or servers, without those people it's done, a few may return, but not enough, its gw2 mojo, too few too late.
---
Automated Tournaments is also a pvp gamemode
---
&gt; Hell, megaservers already did enough damage to many French, German, and Spanish players, and I'd wager a handful of them quit when they couldn't find anyone speaking their languages.
---
Eh, people of unsupported languages have always been playing the game, and it didn't cause us any "damage". Eg. I so often see guild recruitment ads in map chat for Polish guilds. Sometimes I even see some Scandinavian, Dutch, Italian, or my own native, Hungarian. I guess if you're used to games pretty much never supporting your own language, playing in English feels normal.
---
Thank you so much for the tips &lt;3
---
Hotee
---
Exactly. You should not have to run back and forth to view select aspects of character customization; it's incredibly dumb.
---
Damn this is amazing!! I’d LOVE for them to make this now
---
What if they merged them?
---
Rework scribing. Instead using inordinate amounts of materials to make guild decorations, it now uses different amounts of personal housing decorations, allowing players to collaborate better in crafting decorations by splitting recipes between them, and to level up scribing without having to use guild decorations. For example
---
* Right now, to make a Fancy Armchair you need:
---
 * 1 Simple Finishing Kit
---
 * 1 Bronze Chisel
---
 * 5 Green Wood Plank
---
 * 1 Fancy Chair
---
* This recipe would be split in two parts: Personal decoration and Guild decoration:
---
 * Fancy Armchair (Personal)
---
     * 1 Bronze Chisel
---
     * 5 Green Wood Plank
---
 * Fancy Armchair (Guild)
---
     * 1 Simple Finishing Kit
---
     * 1 Fancy Armchair (Personal) in your inventory, personal bank, Personal Housing decoration inventory or guild vault (if you have permission to use it). 
---
     * 1 Fancy Chair (Guild) in guild decoration inventory.
---
This way personal recipes can have reasonable prices, and players can collaborate more easily to make guild decorations, since the work can be split better between players without having to giving all the materials to a few scribing members. 
---
Since guild decorations and housing decorations would use the same mechanics, then they could do stuff for both, and thus.
---
And to guarantee continuous support, we need monetization potential. Right now they earn nothing from doing guild missions.  
---
The best option I see would not be selling decorations in the gemstore, but Recipes.    
---
Players who buy and learn these recipes would become able to craft these decorations for their personal home, and use the personal decorations in guild hall scribing stations to craft guild decoration versions of them.     
---
Gemstore decorations would be account bound, so you can't sell them to someone who wants them for their personal homes, but you would still be able to make the guild version if you have the materials.  
---
So they would also be an investment, because being able to craft these means you can offer to 'sell' your scribing services to guilds who do not have members who can craft them.   
---
They could start with chair novelties since the models and animations are already done.  
---
Unlocking a chair novelty would also unlock the recipe to craft a personal decoration version for your home, and a guild version out of them along a finishing kit and a base guild decoration like a Basic chair.
---
Mesmer and ele are the 2 classes I think the boost is very helpful with as those 2 are quite squishy on lower levels.
---
However, if you are new to the game, its better to exeperience the levelling process (atleast the first time) to learn the game and the mechanics.

Good Tybalt, have a cider.
---
For me, it's not that I save gold for anything in particular. I just don't have anything to buy right now.
---
I'm not a completionist so the skins and dyes that I don't have can stay in the TP for all I care.
---
I hoard pretty much everything that I get from loot (i.e. sigils, runes, boxes of gear) so I'm pretty much set for the next "balance" patch that comes along and I don't need to buy anything.
---
Does the gw2 process appear in task manager? Have you tried both 32 and 62 bit versions (if your CPU and OS support those)? Have you tried reinstalling gfx drivers?
---
I don't set anything aside, I just keep a goal and go for it, once the goal is made I pick another one and repeat. Altho I haven't been playing much lately since the endgame is a  shitty collection farm sim with some AP handout as reward..
---
GW2 "GvG" is a fanmade megazerg deathmatch spamfest, the actual [GvG in GW1](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_versus_Guild) was the most competitive 8v8 gamemode there (and an official one at that). The two have nothing tod owith each other.

the fact that players are leaving in droves. their parent company had to step in and slap them on the wrist, they have had trouble with keeping deadlines since day 1 and they can't even tell us what the plan is for the future, all point towards the fact that they are utterly inept at developing games. that doesn't mean no one with talent or skill works there, it just means that management is high or crazy.

i think i roughly set aside maybe 1-2k for every major update patch, but that's just for BL Key gambling every time they update the chests to get that shiny RNG uncommon item. Legendaries are a project i take at my own pace, and maybe I save up 200-300g of my fractal earnings for a nice gemstore outfit or novelty item here or there.  When a balance patch hits, depending on how good the build is to my liking i might spend 300-500g for infusions/runes and respeccing armor and weapon boxes stored up. Altogether it might be nice to have 3-4k gold in pocket change lying around but I am simply happy doing T4s/CMs daily and a few metas. I don't feel the need to endlessly grind maps now for gold.
---
OP that looks terrible
---
Sorry, as I said I'm a noob, it's EU
---
Well, how about you slack off leveling your Mesmer or whatever and enjoy the open, exploration-based leveling experience while throwing the odd fractal into the mix with your max level Necromancer. Worldbosses can be done with either, so ...
---
This isn't just the ship flying off? Iirc the banners always stay put on the map and the ship moves off. Or am I /whoosh
---
Could be purple non-crystal.  Like...metal or something.
---
I'm actually the reverse. I have a "must spend" limit, where when I go over it, I force myself to buy stuff to back down to that limit.
---
As such I mostly stay between 10k and 11k. But if I see something shiny I'll drop to 6-7k at times. Though, I do find myself running short on things I'm interested in buying. Doing some odd thing from gold to gems of late, but that's mostly fluff I'm buying just to buy things.
---
I feel for you. Just don't want the new generation to be disperced by Alliances.
---
I'm happy to have more than a hundred gold. I don't think I'll run into your problems.
---
Why not?  By hardcore I just mean guilds that can and will fight rather than just ktrain or call raid after they wipe a few times.
---
Someone clearly isn't playing ranked with map and team chat turned on
---
I used it already, n was playing around on my necro for a little earlier.
---
I mean, sure, when PvP was still playable and there were actually some tryhards. Seems like it's more sweet babytears now
---
Don't bother, they "want communication", but will avoid official streams, because they deserve better, as watching that is a waste of time, obviously.
---
Besides catering to pedophiles what did they do wrong? It had to have been something big, right? Tera seemed like such a promising game. The combat was amazing.
---
Shit, you beat me to it xD
---
My point is the amount of guilds that play this game for the fights is getting lower and lower, which is horrible for the fight community.  Guilds quit leaving the remaining guilds less opposition to fight, so they end up quitting or taking a step back as well.  That's why I said earlier that I fear only PPT guilds are gonna be remaining in a matter of months.
---
I am not using any graphic addon, it's just the native game settings.
---
I've used Reshade, with those presets made available and voted on in a WoodenPotatoes giveway post ([https://www.reddit.com/r/WoodenPotatoes/comments/6xa734/giveaway\_and\_megathread\_guild\_wars\_2reshade\_30/](https://www.reddit.com/r/WoodenPotatoes/comments/6xa734/giveaway_and_megathread_guild_wars_2reshade_30/)), but honestly these third-party postprocessors more spoil the visual than make it look beautiful. As well? In some parts of the screen it looks nice, but in others it looks pretty bad. The light and dark shades usually burst and end up hiding the details, especially from other players' sets. For landscapes it is beautiful, but for nearby things usually spoils. It is an overlay, the addon takes your image as if it were 2d on the screen and plays effects, it does not apply the effects by the 3d models, so there is no way to treat the depths and with that the result is average. But anyway, it goes of each one the taste xD Not to mention that if you don't have a good graphics card, this will eat 5 to 10 fps of your game.
---
Yeah that instakill felt really cheap. The fight wasn't even that hard beforehand.
---
I agree that it was actually the worst to fight cookie and his blob.  It's just a sad sign of the times to see him quit though.  We all have our rivalries and grudges with different guilds/servers, but in the end we are all part of the WvW community.  I hate to see that community bleed players.
---
He's one player im happy to bleed.
---
All of them. I want more purple still.
---
holy mother of god, I literally can't believe people keep using delusional excuses to why they can't raid. Just be honest and say ur trash at videogames and don't want to put more than 5mins of effort for free content not even meant for u.
---
let me be very simple for u, making easier content than what devs aim for (making raids to easy for a dev specialized in raids) is NOT fun for them, it limits their freedom and creativity. And if you try to use your brain and put it in reallife, gaming devs that are good at what they do are wanted hard so they'll grab their stuff and ditch companies that force them to do stuff they don't enjoy. Look at the devs that made w1-3 that all left after they were forced on living world/open world stuff because they made good content.
---
So stop ur bs by forcing ur way on raids when raids in this game are already incredible easy and compared to other MMO'S we DO NOT have a repeatable hard mode because the devs are already afraid people like you would cry you can't do it and get the rewards...
---
I agree. I’m tired of that attitude as well. I get bored so I play a couple and switch between. But I’m a dirty casual, so... I’m part of the problem?  I guess?
---
Brahams regrown hair will replace Jormag as an Elder Dragon.

Thank you, added it to the list.

Why Do You Type Like This
---
If 25k gold is your bottom limit, what do you even think you will need that 25k gold to buy in the future?
---
The only gold I set aside is for upcoming festivals/investments - everything else I just use to make more gold.  TBH I don't see the point you're describing unless you want to use the gold on something later and you are saving up.
---
Yes, the list is still up to date.  Put the items from there to my list as well. Thanks you.
---
Anything about 5v5 is a spamfiesta.
---
Ranger, because of the pets.
---
Yeah, although it was cheesy the actual combat was super intimidating; the first battle in the desolation chapter had me considering if I wanted to keep going lmao
---
Yeah, I feel the same. That's why I started this list. I really hope that Arenanet will bring back those things to us players again. I'm a completist myself. 
---
Some old skins are available again thanks to the guaranteed wardrobe unlocks and the legacy reward tracks. I wonder why they didn't put all the old skins there.
---
The group events (usually escorts) that have champs at the end usually give 3 keys, if I remember rightly.

I'm just having trouble stomaching how my old laptop is rendering the Gamebryo style graphics in ESO. I don't usually care about graphics too much but I actually feel physically ill playing the game for very long. Which really disappointed me because I've looked into ESO and it seems to hold a lot of promise. Say what you will about the problems with GW2, it still looks decent on low end computers. Are there graphics mods you can make to the game? I'm afraid that once I run my course through Classic next month I'll be out of an MMO until I get a new computer. I'm quite done with GW2 until they do something radical and miraculous.
---
Which drivers for example?
---
&gt; It went over like a lead balloon, but they tried.
---
Did they really try? It was a very poorly designed MOBA knock-off without the interesting aspects of a MOBA, and it got zero updates/support once it was released.
---
This looks like Joachim Bröden. Change my mind.
---
Press F for Cookie
---
How about tripple trouble?
---
More serious:
---
I've got the impression you are looking for challenging group content as raids? But how much casual- or coregamer group content as team-storymode missions, easy dungeons etc. exists? One 15min fractal each year? GW2 has a lot of casual open world content, yes. There is also plenty of hardcore open world content as achievement hunting, legendary weapons/trinkets and so on. This is endgame content. But for "open world players". If you are looking for instanced challenging endgame content in GW2 there is only raids. And there is one fractal each year for all those casuals. 
---
That's what I refered to with my initial comment.
---
I've got a casual guild. And since the bigger fractal releases in 2013 there was barely any content for us. GW2 is a terrible game for guilds or teamoriented players which are looking for more "co-op" like content. GW2 is great for singleplayers doing open world stuff.
---
Its stuff on core map that was later put in, do they have to be from 2012?
---
How bleak it looks?  That still looks really strong WYM.
---
That's why I've been turning off my chat entirely (switching to guild panel) during games because there's nothing of essence said their anyway.
---
Nice!
---
I encourage you to look at the forums, talk to other engineer players, and play it yourself.
---
Also it was fixed by me uninstalling KB4505903
---
Nope. No way a new player would look that good.
---
This is the map that everyone always says. It's definitely very pretty and varied.
---
Oh, but you can't say that here. All the "Nostalgia Neckbeard Weebs" come out in force to downvote.
---
After pipe organ Caledon Forest, I believe(memory vague)
---
It's been sometime since I last updated my gear. I've seen that Power Soulbeasts now run Thief Tunes instead of Scholar Runes. How much is the DPS difference between those runes? Is it worth to ditch my Scholar Runes and go for the Thief Runes?
---
Sigils affect everything as long as you're swapped to that weapon.
---
It's great until you realize you need to do content that's been dead for months that requires waiting 20-30 minutes for multiple people to join in order to complete it.
---
One of the best experiences I've had has been playing Warframe with people I've met through the game but now it's not the game for me.
---
All I know is that updated to KB4505903 today and then it started happening, I recently uninstalled KB4505903 and now my GW2 is working again.
---
Weapons and breather change when you enter water.
---
What's the difference in weapon strength and stats between the ones you have equipped?

Zhaitan hates iconography, you know

Wrong. [The ship actually moves.](https://i.imgur.com/KE1XnED.jpg)
---
1. You leave trail on the map.
---
2. Cloth experiences physics.
---
3. Things that leave trails when moving actually leave trails.
---
&gt; For example, with an off-hand sigil of force, damage is increased for main-hand, utility, and bundle skills.
---
"For example, with an off-hand sigil of force, damage is increased for main-hand, utility, and bundle skills."

I've tried. It won't let me restart it unless I've beaten it for the first time. I don't know why.
---

---
I know right, literally all 11 people who pvp are a salt mine!
---
Its not just Cookie, at least 3 guilds have just quit the game as well.
---
Does the leap work underwater? If it doesn't then the cool down might be shorter in the underwater version to balance it a bit.
---
Yeah. They forgot to upgrade the underwater version.
---
Instead making separate versions for underwater skills, they should make 1 skill that has a different character animation when used underwater (and mid-air if the skill can be used in the air).
---
I'm on EU as well \^\^ feel free to add me ingame (neviril.4281) I'm on daily \^\^ don't hesitate to send me a whisp if you see me online \^\^

ArenaNet missed a big opportunity by not adding some salt flats, salt mines, or salt whatever to the revamped Heart of the Mists.
---
Oh the irony of this comment.
---
Exactly.
---
It's indeed a leap, but it counts as Dark also.
---
My first game on apex legends and one of my team mates bmd the fuck out of everyone lmao.
---
Also core rev doesn't have the new f2 skill underwater.
---
(sorry, been on holiday)
---
You're absolutely right, I meant to write '8 Weeks' and didn't check before sending &gt;,&lt;
---
They probably would but i assume they can't due to engine restrictions.
---
You should try zerk, its super rewarding
---
Level boosts don’t affect the story. You could hit level 80 without touching the story and it will still be waiting for you.
---
Also t4 fractals. 
---
Which I don't understand. Everything is going smooth, bosses die under 20-30s, mechanics ignored, skips done etc.
---
But no. There is always something someone finds as bad thing. Like "Wow their burst sucked lmao, that spec is not meta for this reason". Who gives a shit, everything died and it wasn't a drag. Plus their dps was same as everyone else's. Guess when everything is fine, nothing ever is.
---
Try repairing the client first. 
---
But yea, leave the baby talk at the door.
---
No it is not. Conquest is a gamemode. Tournaments are just an organisation tool.
---
Stopped caring about building a good game and switched focus to squeezing their current players dry of every last dollar.
---
As long as i can finally use greatsword on revenant with a good power burst legend i will be happy
---
engies already throw their shield as an offhand attack tho
---
Only if you plan to minmax for group content. Generally you don't need to swap.
---
yep same exact thing they said as that revamp we were supposed to get.
---
go search up info about that WvW revamp they announced for HoT.
---
Shit, I'm down for that.
---
Actually looks worse.
---
And you'll get to throw shields with 3 more skills.
---
You can never have too many Captain America builds.
---
Why fill positions after a layoff? 
---
Because people still quit after a layoff. In fact, there is sometimes a little uptick because people are distressed by the layoff. Turnover happens, at all companies.
---
Also, a gap in one function can't always be filled by an existing employer from another. People aren't spare parts with universal connectors (even though companies sure do try to make it so, sometimes!).
---
Lastly, and somewhat related to the previous point, one project can be hiring even when another is shutdown and people are let go. It sucks, but it's not unusual, in my experience.
---
I often hear people assert that expensive employees get let go so that they can be replaced by cheaper ones, and I'm sure that happens, but it has not been my general experience. You can't usually plug a cheap new person into the same hole as an experienced one.
---
Great guide, I'm about 2/3 through it but this has to be downright the most uninspired, boring and grindy piece of content I ever played through in any MMO so far.
---
The first part you literally run through the same zone THREE TIMES to collect different shit that could easily be done into one (aka the scales, the eggs and then the medicine shit).
---
Also gating stuff behind events in maps nobody plays anymore is probably the dumbest thing I've seen in my entire life.
---
Even though I will wholly agree that the state of world vs world needs more than a breath of fresh air, I'm a little surprised at some of these threads. First of all people are under the assumption if there are zero new players going to try World vs world. Off of that point, if new people *are not*  sticking with the game mode, why? Have someone who's been here since betas I can tell you this is a huge improvement to the "pirate ship meta" from way back when. The game mode as a whole has so many more quality of life upgrades that you can't even compare it to what it used to be like. 
---
If anything, there needs to be a much more concentrated effort by players in the game already to recruit *other established players*. By its very nature World versus World is the game mode that necessitates teamwork to make a lot of significant advances. The random Joe trying it out is not going to get very far, and everyone knows that. Even if they have somewhat of a grasp of player-versus-player combat, you really can't do much whenever you get outnumbered five to one or worse. Numbers are the great equalizer in World vs world and that's just as much for its benefit as for its detriment. Players learn that not every fight is winnable and retreat is a perfectly valid option. But if there's no new blood then absolutely the game-mode suffers, the question is how many people have to get their heads removed from their rear ends to realize they have to start teaching if they want the game mode to flourish.
---
It is quite literally a numbers game, and without New World vs World players, not new Guild Wars players necessarily, but *any* players, it will continue to suffer.
---
wouldn't be a surprised in the least. they had the old skill be the beta design for months after HoT launch and it used to do targeted dmg which had no range or LoS check outside of you needing a target
---
To each of it's own. From things you mentioned:
---
&gt;  like updating raids, dungeons, and fractals, buffing Necro, and maybe finally changing how WvW worlds are done
---
I only care about dungeons.
---
Funny thing you say about "stupid meme" where I always see this necro's axe buff meme way more times than player housing.
---
Like I said, to each of it's own.
---
I can't handle this level of meta
---
Ah, fair enough. Carry on, then.
---
One day I will get my fractal armour.

He's just gone out to build a snowskritt.
---
What are those monstrosities?
---
Hey, is there a way to start perfecting my rotation now or is it better to wait til max level? I imagine it'd be keeping dots up while keeping buffs/debuffs going, then spam a regular attack in between. Also, do dots snapshot like if I put up a buff then use a dot will the dot keep that same strength during the entirety of it's duration?

Pride and ego rule all.

I have learned a lot from higher skilled players, but It takes swallowing your pride to take advice, and it takes tempering your ego to provide meaningful advice. 
---
I’d rather risk the bad, and savour the good, than create a bubble-like safe space where I cannot be criticized, and reject all perspectives other than mine. Seems like the adult thing to do, and hey? If someone is a dick, you block them,  not preemptively silence teammates. 
---
By saying “turn off chat, its a cesspool” op is basically saying: you will never have friendly teammates, you will never be able to strategize and nobody will ever be respectful. And then, when people try to be friendly, or helpful, or want to strategize, you’ve already imposed the preconceived notion that everyone is a salty asshole.
---
The initial camp-setting escorts and the Kill the Mender events give three keys each, but also generate three chests at the end, so you don't actually gain keys by doing them (but still get loot).  You'll also get three keys from the mid-boss events during the final battle (Wrathbringer/etc.), and then from winning the final battle itself.
---
Every other event only gives a single key.

Is it whilst fighting Dhuum CM?

More like when you pay a sub the devs are under a lot of pressure to release content, make it good quality and release it on a schedule otherwise people just stop subbing and game goes under. It's like holding a gun on their heads, power to  the consumer.

Huh, that actually really helped. Thank you!
