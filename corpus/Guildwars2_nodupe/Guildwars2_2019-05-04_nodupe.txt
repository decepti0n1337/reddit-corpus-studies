No, they did not.
---
---
---
\^ This one. This one was true horror.
---
It will likely remain messy for a long time until people figure out the limitations of flight canopy, not unlike the complexities of the griffon and roller beetle.
---
And dat fgs
---
Pretty sure the Springer already broke core and HoT maps enough for Skyscale to do what it does.
---
The first one, the second one was a mess and didn't take long to get reverted.
---
&gt; Even it being a dragon is boring. 
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I... I don't understand this statement.
---
So what does buffing the bunny do for its use? Seems to me like you would only use it over dragon in areas where enemies have hard DPS but you need to get high quickly
---
Just like this: https://i.pinimg.com/736x/aa/cd/ba/aacdba265deefa6f8edfcf8f28ed9fb8.jpg
---
[removed]
---
And i am ok with that, the game is 7 years old now, the challenge has been moved into other parts other than how to reach certain locations (which mesmers made them irrelevant anyway).
---
Dragons are awesome and all but a dragon mount is just kinda cliche and overdone so it's not very interesting. Maybe they'll do something with the lore but even the way they talk about it in this makes it seem like is was just rule of cool because it's the dragon rider fantasy *again*.
---
I refuse to wear any part of the armour until its complete. I'm only 6 Li away from it. I know what you mean about wvw I'm the same. but I used to run the old condi reaper and condi scourge but these days I lean more to power reaper and condi scourge. I've yet to try support scourge but I wouldn't trust myself to be a good support personally
---
Every time i see JOEL i know is gonna be epic! Thank you man you are awesome!
---
I don't think people even care too much about how well the bannerslave does so long as their banners are up
---
well, once you have that legendary armor, trying out something new like support scourge is a lot easier :D.  Its an interesting style of play, pre-healing before damage, but ultimately it feels weak to me in comparison to other healers because it doesn't provide any boons.
---
I agree the only party wide boon necro gives is vampirism and it's extremely weak in comparison to other professions
---
by reflecting on how toxic your attitude is and then working on changing yourself for the better. if you do, it will show
---
I play a Ranger and this is my biggest gripe. I'm sitting around level 70 and haven't really done anything team based yet, but the fact that I know longbow is not only suboptimal but so bad that it'll get you kicked is upsetting.
---
Cannot wait for people with Skyscales stick to the walls in LA.
---
Agreed, its called the "Holy Trinity" for a reason, it's a sacrosanct system in rpgs.  I appreciate anet's attempt at this grand experiment, but to me without it, things are just messy.
---
I was thinking more of the magic slowly leaking from his wounds(as you can see in the trailer Kralk is leaking smoke all over the place), or something that makes mist even more unstable. Killing Kralk would cause all the magic instantly explode and nuke Tyria....
---
All I remember was a certain devourer queen which never appeared. At least not when I was around. :)
---
It's been broken into before but this time took the extra time to be fully inside of it and take pictures, there's an inactive Asura gate that goes nowhere when interacted with and vendors are in every room of the vault but the last.
---
Currently possibly exploitable as Balthazar weapon vendor is still active(?)
---
Method used is Big Jackal Jump to launch into part of the gate, then relog to place yourself on the other side.
---
I’m thinking of making a WvW set for Guardian, but can’t decide between Marauder or Minstrel. Marauder would be for roaming and dailies whereas Minstrel for Zerg play. 
---
I main Core Guard in PvP, which is why I’m considering the Marauders. WvW gameplay will be split 50-50 between roaming and zerging. My other WvW toons are roamer Chrono (best at this), Dire FB and Hammer Rev. 
---
Another thing, if I do make Minstrels, it’s a toss between FB and Scrapper. For context, I play Druid in fractals and support FB in PvP. Would appreciate input from seasoned WvW-ers!
---
ah im sorry, I was tired from a long drive and just scanned over the post quickly and missed some stuff &gt;.&gt;
---
First if all, find out if it were from legit merchant before, confront moderators on here about it.  Then get opinions as last time we had rules for giveaways
---
Forget all you know about traditional mmorpgs.
---
Come in with fresh eyes, it's the best advice I can give you.
---
I have a 1600 and 1060 ti, i would recommend going intel tbh.
---
Yeah, played with a pair of guardians. They'd shove as many enemies as possible into a corner, park a Meteor Shower on 'em and GS charge right into the mess. The numbers were glorious.
---
One thing I like is when a fantasy setting *doesn't* have its peoples and cultures remain completely stagnant over the course of hundreds of years. It's much more believable for them to change and evolve over time. You'd think *someone* would invent something new within 250 years, ya know?
---
Some stuff. Not much.
---
I don't think anyone has compiled a full list, but it's basically just crafting materials and some dropped gear.
---
F2P is really just a way to see if you like the game enough to buy it, and the restrictions on it are pretty intense.
---
Only 50% bots..
---
Its the nostalgia glasses. WP suffers from those as well.
---
And all of those are mesmers? Because we talking mesmers here.
---
Yeah, I find in HoT and PoF the defensive stat boost doesn't help at all and a longer fight is more likely to cause me to die on a squishy class. I'm better off going with full offense and using active defenses.
---
what's the point of even nerfing the griffon?
---
it's literally only pve that just gives freedom of movement.
---
This almost looks comic-ish I love it!
---
Perhaps you could be able to explain it to me... What exactly do you mean by mounts "breaking" maps? And how would true flight be different from using a combination of existing mounts? I have my ideas as to what you might mean, but I'd rather get your perspective for sure.
---
While I'm not fond of the second Mastery (seems constrictive in an otherwise large pool of other mounts where the emphasis is on freedom of movement, it would've been more acceptable if the dash while in air was here instead tbh) the rest looks amazing and I can't wait to try it in game! Love the animations as always and the distinctness from the griffon/springer even though they can fulfill similar roles.
---
It's super funny when you're running with a squad and your one meteor shower puts you in first place on arcdps's damage board.
---
did i miss it?
---
I really disagreed with that when it was a big controversy thing, and it ultimately made me quit WoW for good. I thoroughly enjoyed the ability to explore maps however I wanted, and when it started to be taken away, I just spent less time in those areas and more time in the old zones. Eventually I accepted that they weren't going to go back to the old "unlock flying at max level" system and said my goodbyes. WoW isn't a fun game without it.
---
What I love about GW2's mounts is they let you effectively do the same thing. You don't have to fight through gauntlets of annoying and dangerous trash mobs to go somewhere if you don't want to. I certainly don't. A true flying mount would let me enjoy the maps even more, because I wouldn't be whizzing through them at 100mph and I could take it slow and enjoy the scenery the devs worked hard on.
---
Check my comment history, i am not a fan of the skyscale.
---
Honestly love using weapon skills to travel on ele, very satisfying.
---
Why do you need a flying mount when you already have what you want in game.
---
We'll know soon^tm
---
What makes it feel weird though is that Sonic has been around for 20 years. It's not exactly a "flash in the pan" character. Seems less ignorance and more either apathy or a calculated ploy to get free advertising by releasing a horrible trailer.
---
This totally would depend on what you prefer to do more i would say. If you prefer to roam more in WvW then go for marauder, if you prefer to zerg more in WvW go for minstrel. 
---
I can tell you what I did and some benefits, I have a firebrand dedicated  for WvW but I have geared him in minstrel exotics and not ascended. These exotics I got from farming reward tracks in pvp and wvw. Reason? Because minstrel ascended gear seemed like a lot of investment just for one game mode and one particular class. I made marauder ascended which you can flip between different classes, rev, guard and warrior all use it. This can be done until you gear all the alts. I dunno I am back to full zerker tbh after running marauder for a long time just for more damage as I think I can survive better now.
---
Well the link I gave is for DLGamer's constant sale (official retailer). As for when it goes on sale that depends, they did have [several sales] (https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aos6qb/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_february_09/eg9tuac/) including one [in March](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/welcome-back-to-guild-wars-2-week-one/) and a [giveaway for Path of Fire](https://twitter.com/Alienware/status/1121081372452499459) (yes I know they put the wrong info in the post) a little over a week ago. I'd expect that they do something for the anniversary sale in August but who knows what else before that. 
---
Depending on what you do with your gear it changes the build a lot especially for a condition damage build. Also mirage in PvP and WvW did get some pretty heavy nerfs to it's survivability and damage so you might want to look into that and other builds before you decide fully (mass invis did get a buff but it has to compete with stealth gyro in zergs).
---
I'm curious as to why? You spend the majority of the meta in combat. A lot of the downtime events are easy enough with mushrooms... mounts are useless when fighting the mouth. I mean if you're talking about after you kill the mouth, then yeah I can see your point as you can get to the pods faster.
---
Another thing I spotted in the stream: an actually working motion blur. Unlike the slider in the settings that has been there since PoF beta and doesn't do absolutely anything. I wonder if it's finally coming, or if it's just a feature that will be forever stuck on dev clients, like targetframe healthbars displaying subtracted health with a white flash. You can see the motion blur almost at the end of the vod when Joel compares skyscales's engage skill to gryphon's.
---
Dragonhunter is pretty much unbeatable as far as burst DPS goes, it also has some pretty good skills for safety allowing it to sustain DPS without dying.
---
Holosmith has amazing cleave and good CC and can burst almost as high as dragonhunter, though it inflicts self-damage which makes it very squishy. It also suffers from fairly significant downtime while waiting for photon forge to recharge.
---
Soulbeast doesn't deal as much damage as the other two, but has access to potent team buffs making it pretty strong. It also self-buffs pretty nicely which can be good for soloing.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
From a pure damage perspective, dragonhunter is pretty dominant and is easily the most useful in both forms of high-end PvE.
---
Yeah lol sorry new to reddit so forgive my silliness xd But thx for the answering, cant wait to get home and to eb to test out what u suggisted :)
---
Remember the concept of the wall climbing spider mount? Here we have it, they just added a bit of flying.
---
Ehh,old days.
---
Riiiight forgot about engage skill
---
This hurts my soul to read.
---
&gt;KiteWatcher
---
Hey, any idea how a mirage would fare in fractals?  Getting close to a full set of ascended light armor.  Going to try out the warrior as well.
---
Also how can anyone say true flight would ruin the game? They ruined any meaning of traveling at release when they put like 20 waypoints into each core map. If you would add a trueky flying mount in gw1, now THAT would ruin it.
---
The "Twice-Told Legend" achievement was added as, basically, a consolation prize for anyone who had crafted two identical legendaries before the Wardrobe system came out.
---
I get what you're saying and will congratulate you because you got your first like minded commenter, BUT, I can also understand people's concerns for true flight. bearing both arguements in mind, then what is truly the point of getting this mount mechanics-wise if you are a PoF user? everything it can do can already be done by other mounts and at a faster pace.  
---
Seems to me the skyscale is a f2p mount that combines the utilities of pof mounts that are and are not kind of invalidating pof mounts
---
No keys in the wallet. No storage for map currencies. Those weren't even that long ago!

If only there was a suit with a chest window outfit
---
Thanks so much!
---
That's totally fair. My friend couldn't get into it, either. It just doesn't click with some people.
---
Interestingly, while I totally agree that all the problems you listed are real ones, I don't think about them much. Like, for instance, when you mention
---
&gt; Fetch quests that go back and forth between an outpost and adjacent explorable area, thus respawning enemies every time.
---
I know exactly what you mean. And that is frustrating. But for some reason, I legit just don't give it much thought. I'm not trying to sway your perspective, just trying to offer some insight to my own.
---
I honestly find GW1 a bit more relaxing than GW2, and I think one big reason is that I see GW1 more as a game. Now maybe that's because GW2 is where I started in this franchise and I have a lot of heavy invested emotions in it after nearly seven years. But like, GW1 is a nice break because I see it more as just a game with fun and sometimes frustrating mechanics. And along with that, I'm more willing to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the environment and spectacle they're trying to sell, whether or not it's really all that great.
---
GW2 is more freeform, higher quality, and tries to really get you invested in the world. So when things don't mesh, they break down harder. I think that's where the "GW1 is superior" mentality comes from. It relies a lot more on the player's imagination and suspension of judgement. And so long as you have that, it's hard to go wrong.
---
Ranger's Longbow and also Guardian/Dragonhunter's Longbow are both more of a PvP and WvW weapon than PvE because they are burst-based and control-heavy, making them great in those modes.
---
Ranger Longbow gives kiting potential with the stealth and knockback, and all specs Core/Druid/Soulbeast are famous for their Knockback -&gt; Rapid Fire bursts, often coupled with Quickness and "Strength of the Pack!" and lately the +40% amplifier from Sic 'Em (Soulbeast). Imagine people being helpless as you perch 1200-1800 range away pinging people with 4-6k Longbow autos and 20k+ Rapid Fires - that's what a Ranger with a Power setup and a Longbow can do.
---
*Cries in fear*
---
The best part is that they know they fucked up on it as evidenced by the fact that they have to add in patch job tanking mechanics like the aggro swap on SH (which is the closest the game ever gets to proper tanking) to make the encounters even remotely interesting to tank, but Anet would never admit that their constant unecessary re-invention of the wheel is a bad idea because 'mUh InNoVaTiOn'
---
That answer is essentially game dev longtalk for "We really don't want to even say it's even slightly possible otherwise we'd never hear the end of people wanting it". There was a bug that existed for a while about a year after release that allowed you to preview mixed and matched armour weights. The worst that appeared was, obviously, clipping issues and models seams not matching to the point that you'd have invisible sections missing from midriffs, arms, legs etc. on certain combinations. It would most definitely be a huge undertaking to get the mixed class armours working, but it's definitely not impossible, considering it used to exist (poorly) and was removed.
---
Ticket them, they remove it in about a day
---
I love gw1 story more not because every single character had their own story but more that everything is tied. For example you the mursaat had their own stories and lores and tengu. Their stories and extend extremely far to all corners of the game and have far reaching influences. These would not only include text but weapons and classes.
---
 There's an assassin class because of the time in cathan with shrio, the Jade sea separated the fractions etc. In gw2 you suddenly get a new profession. No explanation no reason no back story. Oh hai I am a revenant. Don't ask but yeah we are here now.
---
Legendary weapons? Why are they legendary? No source no story. They are just added. They are legendary because they are glowy. In gw1 u had these green weapons you had to do a specific quest to kill a specific boss who has a known skillset u gotta learn to fight. Gw2? Na. Random drop and farm.
---
The amount of lore in gw1 far exceeds all of gw2. I love gw2 gameplay and the details with each character but the overall lore feels very lacking.
---
1.Is there a profession and build that focus on critical and viable on one of the end game content?
---
2.Can I safely sell (or mindlessly use) lower tier sigil/rune, or should I keep it (will it be need for something like crafting)?
---
3.Is there any trophy item that will be automatically sold by "sell junk" button but actually worth keeping?
---

---
 [https://i.imgur.com/Irkq61L.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Irkq61L.jpg)
---
I wouldn't mind but i mostly just don't like lions arch, the amount of effects peoples armor have, and honestly mounts.
---
Bunny also 100x cuter. 🐰
---
That isn't a true statement, it's just an opinion.
---
WoW was ruined when they started *restricting* flying, and I quit WoW because of it.
---
It was only there for about a year thankfully
---
I love when new players call me daddy
---
1) by "focus on critical", I'm assuming you mean focus on critical hits? In end game content, any power build is expected to pretty much have maxed out critical hit chance anyways when taking into account party and utility buffs. Here are the meta [fractal](https://discretize.eu/builds) and [raid](https://snowcrows.com) build sites, pick one that you like and go crazy
---
2) you can salvage them into parts, which can come in handy for crafting. They don't tend to sell for much, so I think you have better output if you salvage
---
3) nope, just sell them all
---
Also high ping is bad for berserker but that's nothing new
---
Im just hoping its not a grind to get it. I couldn't bear another 250 gold thing like the griffin
---
I see the VM inf tools are back in the shop. Are they worth it? I don't have any infinite tools, but these seem expensive, and I feel like there are better versions to wait for, no?
---
Throw these over to r/GuildWarsDyeJob they love this kind of stuff.
---
Most good power builds try to get crit to 100% (or at least very close). Most condition damage builds also run viper armor which has a decent amount of precision. It really comes down to what you want to do with that crit chance, there are builds (like [power chrono](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/), [daredevil](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/daredevil/power/), [deadeye](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/deadeye/power/), etc) that get a lot of bonus ferocity and critical damage.
---
Your options with old runes/sigils now is to salvage, sell, or mystic forge them. I'd suggest selling (on the TP) the ones you can, forging them is a pretty big gamble but can pay off, and then salvaging them gives you materials to use to make others or to sell.
---
Anything that is "junk" is not important and can be sold without worry, it's only there as more gold.
---
Oh that's my mistake, I meant to have the settings be identical. However, shadows didn't make a huge different in my testing. I usually crank my settings pretty low for max frames in PvP
---
More and more with each attempt to stop them. It's like to sew shut a hole in vinyl, we're just punching more, smaller holes.
---
If I recall it's a running gag. In Guild Wars 1 you would constantly hear about this mysterious Wizards Tower, but you never got to go inside. In Guild Wars 2 the gag continues.
---
You can expect them to continue to tease its mysteries periodically, but nothing will ever come of it.
---
Dunno, Chrono being the only meta tank and the "flexibility" in encounter design being literally outright ignoring mechanics or skipping them through sheer damage leaves me pretty dissatisfied with raiding in this game.
---
The tanking experience in gw2 is mostly doing the default Chrono rotation that you would do as an off-Chrono, except you might need to hold Sword 2 and Shield 4 for specific attacks. And the experience isn't very different from tanking in orher games: you face the boss away from the group most of the time, move the boss, mitigate damage, maybe heal yourself a bit. It's hella stale in gw2 and ffxiv, but fun in WoW because there are multiple viable tanks that do these things very differently from each other.
---
You're also limited by space. You won't always have enough room to maneuver that way
---
If a player has both gear unlocked, they could make an Achievement reward item so you use it on mystic forge to get a skin combination of the both. That would not hurt anyone or anything.
---
the devs have put it as a jet (griffon) vs. a helicopter (skyscale)  
---
Griffon is still good at what it does, but the Skyscale can be good for getting altitude and gliding.
---
But also horribly breaks a lot of maps. They don't seem to mind minor breaks, with a few curious folk slipping out to explore the great empty beyond, but having the entire playerbase easily traipsing off across the unmade wastes beyond the edge of the world would cause...problems.
---
Fashion Wars 2: What's the point in tanking it up if you can't enjoy playing the pretty princess game?
---
Easy to understand, tricky to master.
---
what springer update?? what did I miss?
---
Yup. Blizzard devs said they very much regret adding true flying to the game because it trivializes so much and once that cat is out of the bag, it's hard to rain it back. I stopped playing WoW in Cataclysm but even then I would hop on a flying mount, hit auto-run, then AFK. Granted that's not as much of an issue with GW2 thanks to waypoints, but still.
---
With the griffon you still have to think about where you are and what you're doing and it takes a certain amount of skill with the mount to skip past large chunks of a map (Hot not included). You don't suddenly end up with the ability to ignore all mobs, terrain, and other mounts with the push of a button.
---
dh and sb is better for fractals since burst dmg and fractal bosses die pretty fast compared to raid bosses, id go with holo for raids and most fun to play of the 3.
---
Ideally guard could do it as a healer but by doing so they loose allot of the positioning and range they need.
---
Which is rather sad and could easily be fixed by simply reducing the cast time of the auto attack then adjusting numbers as needed.
---
That's the insanity setting in, resist it.
---
Not really any way to predict it. At least once a week (typically tuesdays) things rotate in/out of the gem store, so just check occasionally and you'll catch it again. At the worst, it's almost guaranteed sometime shortly before halloween.
---
No, it isn't. OP is making use of D9VK, a fork of DXVK which translates D3D API calls to Vulkan.
---
d912pxy wouldn't run on Linux, nor would there be much point.
---
Yeah but this chair is a chair you can sit proudly in.  You earned this chair.  WITH SWEAT AND BLOOD!!!
---
no, the griffon is, but its locked from f2p players. given they both can gain altitude somehow by utilising terrain, griffins can still do it much faster. skyscale is pretty big though, for f2p players anyway. they get a gimped version of the pof Springer and griffon in a bundle
---
Yes because in no other game there are bikinis with plate armor defense ratings
---
can the skyscale actually wall climb? or do you mean wall cling? can we use it to gain height even though stamina doesn't recharge while you're on the wall?
---
I also wanna tell Anet something as an obsessive compulsive about the animation between 7 and 8 seconds; When the fire-breathing animation ends, there is a  very small moment that the mount goes directly through the "standing" animation that doesn't feel natural / smooth. Please fix it before you launch the mount cause i can't unsee that.
---
I'm legitimately curious/excited with the finale exactly because of that. Things have been escalating since HoT, surely at some point we'll find a way to *diffuse*, I refuse to believe it can only get worse for another two years.
---
The minute we'll find a proper diffuse, it'll allow the story to explore new directions and new routes for hopefully more tame storylines for a change. Catastrophes over catastrophe can be redundant.
---
I always envied people who can match their armors and colours in a harmony cause i can't. They are so beautiful that i hate you.
---
Yes it is.
---
Honestly a lot of links were outdated and wasn't sure if there is a updated version or not
---
Can you actually make one for me with The Ascension? That's my first and favourite legendary and i've tried many times to match the colours of my armor with it but as i said i never could.
---
O content is fenomenal! PoF didn't got me off the track most of the time, but HoT on the other hand, I was on my way for story mission and found myself doing Metas for 1 hour forgetting what I've went for
---
Well, the thing is, HOT wasn't mean to just do story. That's why you had to train masteries in between to continue story. Half the story is in the zones.
---
I'll have a look tomorrow and will send you my results :)
---
If you do not find any better idea, I would be glad if you could give it to me for my main account. I own only HoT and do not have the money to get PoF :(
---
Thank you very much
---
I think GW1 does more with less, and I think that's an important distinction to make.  It's a very technically well created game that's very aware of it's limitations yet still offers beautiful vistas and environments such as the dusk overlooking the HoM @ the EoTN.
---
Enemies have a bar under their HP. This is their CC(crowd control) bar. If you use stuns, knockbacks, etc. you will lower it. Once its depleted enemies will be stunned for a while and take increased damage. Enemies in HoT tend to have more armor (Hammer frogs take barely half your damage) and stunning them removes their armor, so they are very easy to kill.
---
If enemies have no CC bar you can always CC them.
---
If the bar is blue you can Stun them, but you'll often need more then 1 CC. Rolling Devils will stun themselves if they roll into a wall.
---
A yellow bar means an enemy got stunned recently and is immune to stuns. It slowly fills up until the enemy can be stunned again.
---
Grey bars mean an enemy is CC immune, but will occasionaly get a blue CC bar. This often happens when they charge up a strong attack. You usually have a small timeframe to break the bar before enemies become CC immune again.
---
Most bosses in expansion maps have grey bars while those in the core maps have blue ones.
---

Hope these offer some inspiration for anyone trying to get similar looks
---
As in, the other mounts started off as a function before they were given their form. 
---
For example, "we need a mount that can jump really high", and they came up with the idea to use a rabbit. 
---
"We need a mount to traverse large gaps," and they brainstormed a raptor for that purpose. 
---
For the Skyscale, they're saying that their first idea was "We want to do a dragon mount," before they went on to brainstorm what the mount even does.
---
Guardian can actually tank several bosses pretty well and AFAIK is the one tanking on several bosses in Chrono/FB/Ren compositions.
---
GW2 at launch was a fun game but so many systems are in place now that cut out the bullshittery.
---
Lets list some shall we?
---
* Black lion gathering tools that you can buy from the gem store, they only have 25 uses (10 for gathering) but they give some higher chance at materials!
---
* The amount of black lion chests you got and how trash they were compared to now (I recently sold over 500 for a lot of money)
---
* Dungeons and how hard they were, especially story mode. WARRIOR GREATSWORD META.
---
* How useless some classes  were, Engineer specifically, Ranger was also pretty fucked. 
---
* No wallet, all tokens from all dungeon stored in your bags/bank, no other ways to acquire t6 materials except "luck" - THE MAGIC FIND GEAR, OH GOD THE GEAR. 
---
* How slow Guardians were getting around maps, how slow everyone was except thieves for getting around the maps, I remember having to press a button every 10 seconds so I could keep swiftness up on my Engineer. 
---
* The lack of rewards for doing metas and maps, for example Teq was a huge mess and any events you did on maps gave you just copper and karma, nothing else. 
---
* The entire wardrobe system? I mean jesus, I've had the same main for over 5 years now, at least now I can farm skins for all my characters
---
* How using asura gates was the refereed method of travel because way points were so damn expensive along with the repair costs
---
* How you got shoe-horned in the story for Kormir 2.0 
---
* Hero points so you can unlock skills
---
* The fact that your endgame map choices consisted of: Snow people and a lot of water and hearing "MORE, HERE" and "EVERYONE, CUM" ^(together)   x100
---
* No unbreakable tools
---
I can't think of anymore right now, If I really thought I could. I do agree about Lion's arch though, it's a giant theme park with 0 rides, this is why Evon Gnashblade was the right choice, I really miss old LA and LS1.
---
Disagree with mounts massively, they have breathed an entirely new life into this game and changed the way you play it.
---
Dude, you have vsync limit turned on, while d9vk ignores that, giving over 60 FPS, but looks like windows one keeps fps at 60.
---
And also if you really want to compare, you should find a place with same amount of draws, cuz mustlock sanctuary can be overcrowded or almost empty giving too much comparative error.
---
Thank you for clarifying! Well for the most part I tend to Google everything but game itself isn't exactly good in explaining the mechanics and even tho I watched quite a few videos trying to understand the game it's still so big and unfathomable amount of stuff to go through and understand, so every help like yours now is appreciated
---
*Laughs in I could outrun a centaur*
---
What dyes and gearpieces do you use on your soulbeast, it looks amazing!
---
&gt;From Beta Testing till now, here's my Fashion Wars
---
It will take more than just a Sonic redesign to save the film. The writing is garbage(sonic pretending to be a cat), the setting is basic (US military again?!). Nope of the jokes in the trailer are funny, and there are already movies starring Jim Carrey as Jim Carrey. 
---
Well, at least the reviews will be entertaining.
---
also best texture filter. whats your monitor refresh rate? vsync can cap it on windows to 60
---
Running a Ryzen 1600X and GTX 1060 6GB here. Very happy with performance at 1080p. Everything maxed out with model limits at low/medium and I get 50-60FPs in all open world non-zerging content. Cities are 30-45 and incredibly rarely do I ever see drops below 30 but usually it is only world bosses and massive metas like istan or huge wvw fights.
---
2600+1080 will be just fine. That being said, as others have mentioned, if you can afford it wait for the Ryzen 3xxx chips as if everything we've heard is true, they will be worth the extra money.
---
But they can't change the setting, the writing and the jokes. Those elements are just as awful.
---
I think that was some in between system because I vaguely remember reading about it and thinking how glad I was to have everything unlocked on my chars already.
---
the research on this doesn't seem very accurate.
---
make sure your testing environment is the same and make sure that there aren't any settings that hinder results (v-sync)
---
is this in reference to the golem HP in auric basin? if so the champ is absolute paper; make sure you have a cleanse for the burn+slow rockets (or ideally avoid them; a reflect does this nicely); burn the champ down asap then the other two golems are just meatshield with little threat... you can always LoS down the little ramp too if you need to stall for cds or something
---
&gt; ...game itself isn't exactly good in explaining the mechanics...
---
yea its a real shortfall of the game sadly. So much has changed and several times since the games launch and so little of it is properly explained to new players. When I got back into the game anytime I had a questions wheres this thing? whats that skill do? what materials do i need to craft this? etc etc the wiki was always a good place to go. Like you said " ...the game it's still so big and have unfathomable amount of stuff to go through and understand..." 
---
Most players are happy to help new folks out, doubly so when they show they arnt just looking for someone to do all the research for them or read a wiki page to them. You gonna do great.
---
Yes, helicopters can and do literally fly up cliffs and without the need to stop and rest every ten feet.
---
F2P players don't have access to any mount. You need POF to play the new living story.
---
Well, this is embarrassing, one of my sylvari is wearing that same outfit-minus all the extra pretties.
---
&gt; GW1 has much more of an adult tone to it than GW2
---
When I was working through prophecies, the game did seem to take itself fairly seriously and treated its characters reasonably. Of course there's some stuff with explaining video game mechanics through the gameplay world, but overall it was pretty grounded.
---
Then when I started in Factions holy shit did Tutorial Land do its best to remind you that you're playing a video game and gave 0 fucks about the fourth wall. When you get over to Kaineng it's a little bit better... Until some really campy cutscenes start playing. I laughed at the opening cinematic for Tahnnakai Temple with Vizu and Shiro :V
---
I haven't started fresh in Nightfall yet, but that was a bit of a mixed bag too. Things seem to kind of just conveniently fall in your lap ala chosen one syndrome, and the heroes are far too convenient / definitely carry you but don't seem to have any agency of their own beyond you within the story. Plus Koss just randomly doing the hipthrust dance was... Yeah, just kind of memey. Silly, funny, kind of fit his character in a way, but just like how many of the NPCs have random barks during idles/combat, it felt a bit weird.
---
... the thing is, I don't really think GW2 was any less "adult" by comparison. GW1 put a lot of attention on *you* while GW2 put the emphasis on a world around you where you are the main character in your own story yet simultaneously a supporting character in the stories of others around you. There have been more moments of brevity since the introduction of Taimi &amp; Co. but I still feel like there's a weight to the overall story of the world which goes beyond *you*. I find that way more interesting than everything working out like you're the chosen one.
---
Wow, that Norn soulbeast is stunning! Your thief and [my engi](https://imgur.com/h7P62eQ.png) could be twins, heh. :)
---
the players seem to be the same so it's the same instance. the fov seem to be different tho resulting in different amount rendered
---
I love the mounts but I feel sad it killed so much of the exploration of Vanilla and HoT maps.
---
You kind of feel overpowered for exploration now.
---
O_O you just changed my life, thank you!
---
As far as I remember, that's how it was in the beginning. You had to buy books to make the higher trait levels available.
---
I really enjoyed that about exploration. Every vista was a fun mini jumping puzzle.
---
For the life of me I don't personally support outfits but you proved more than plenty that you have a sense of fashion even without outfits
---
Going to take the opportunity to share my beloved Chrono (played ger for hundreds of Hours, goooood Chrononail)
---
Ahhhhhh my wings are buuurrrning
---
Oh crap I didn't even knew that vampiric rune was a thing, I thought "leech" was non existent in this game because I found it hard to come by apart from berserker's heal, yeah fights I do try and start for the most part with a pull from raptor especially with me running condi aoe build but I didn't knew that Springer had +dmg towards blue bar so Ty for that information. Also what food buffs you suggest for me to buy or the ones you prefer in open world
---
Best I think is to find a guildie on a free account and ask to buy off of you at a discount. Obv trust must be built prior to selling but it does happen quite often around me.
---
Don't tell them about how attributes used to work.
---
It would haunt them so.
---
Maybe the skyscale is the warclaw with wings depending how you look at it.
---
Hah, I remember the people complaining when the wallet was added because they were afraid they would spend all their gold that they had been hiding from themselves on an alt:)
---
If getting around in HoT annoys you, the mounts masteries and mounts from PoF help a lot. Other than that, it's mostly just "get good".
---
And it's not all that hard once you get the hang of it. Especially once you figure out where not to stand when certain attacks are incoming. I find I usually need 5 minutes to get into my HoT mode when entering from other zones, mostly because HoT enemies hit harder if you stand in the wrong place. But for the most part, they are just as easy to kill as any other enemies.
---
Leader of the Yak
---
Try right clicking lots of stuff man. Like salvage kits.
---
... I did this achievement and didn't get a chair? Just checked it in my AP's as well, got the achievement, not the novelty.
---
It should be okay for the most part, including t5. If you are doing cm fractals however you should use a power build.
---
Was coming to say the soul beast is on point. The mostly black of the others is meh.
---
Personally i liked the harder dungeons but since we have raids now for difficulty i don't mind. I still have ptsd from hearing the asura that yells at you for the crucible of eternity event.
---
I will say i don't have a full opinion on mounts as i have hsd a hard time pushing through HoT and i played at launch. Can't get into the game solo and no one i know plays
---
Guardian movement wasn't to bad with the staff movement speed buff. Still waiting on Thief to be good for pve for once.
---
Otherwise i do agree it is better then it was at launch. I had to kill skillpoint monsters stuck in walls while inderwater and that was if the skillpoint worked. But a classic version would still get a lot of attention since people go nuts over classic WoW and that's a massive grindfest that requires absolutely all your free time.
---
first you are imagining me asking you for a date and now you think I am female...
---
My bad for assuming the guy with dbz in his name would get the dbz meme.
---
It is difficult to get them in combat without killing, yes
---
You can sometimes heal some green NPCs but not always
---
if  that's true, then skyscale has very little value... at least to me
---
The ghost of King Adelburn here.  Since all the Charr that exist currently live in Tyria, I am OK with nuking all of Tyria.  We owe them one.  It actually sounds like a great plan.  When do we get started?
---
Doing that too often gets costly. Not everyone plays the TP and becomes millionaires. No need to ride high horses.
---
It’s got electrolytes!
---
Oh shit, I did't find this. I tried checking the [Living World](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World) page, and didn't even think to check the overall zones page. I didn't find anything in Living World, and a quick google search didn't show anything immediately interesting, I must've just somehow missed this.
---
They are never offered separately though the pack has gone on sale. Your only option for the skin is to get the pack but you can buy the [glyph by itself](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Glyph_of_Volatility_\(Unused\)) if you wanted on the TP (it is a random black lion chest drop that isn't currently in the rotation) though I wouldn't suggest it.
---
They did a pretty good job with this short stream answering specific questions from chat.
---
*Laughs in Flesh Wurm*
---
Cool mount, good stream. Positive progress.
---
It's a lot better with effect LOD, though some bosses like largos twins are still quite hard to see
---
Not if you slot the minions in your water skill slots.
---
I'll give you my favorite way of making legendary, that actually feels like a journey.
---
First, plug you API to gw2efficiency and make a bookmark directly to your lege crafting list (with selected option to use your materials), so you can easily access it. Also, if you are really dedicated player, make it your home page.
---
There you will see how much gold would it cost if you just buy all materials on TP. This will be your main indicator.
---
Now, what I do is to almost never buy materials but get them the other way. For example those dreaded T6 trophies or thousands of metals and wood.
---
Pick your favourite game content and use it to get gold too, but stay away from daily grinding or you may burn out. I like daily 2g, ranked pvp, and sometimes fractals t4. I think you are able to access them, I believe you have fully ascended hero right now, if not making a legendary is a huge mistake.
---
Now, from your gw2eff shopping list, pick a material or some, and read about them. Maybe it's easy to gather, maybe you have gathering boosters, maybe it's available from LS4 VM boxes (trophies), or maybe it's only vendored from npc (ice runes). There are also ways of promoting materials to higher tiers and it's very efficient.
---
See or ask for time gated materials, like amalgamated stones, also read about all ways of obtaining them. Get ley line converter to get Indian without farming "for free".
---
If you see that particular material is really cheap, just go and make some buy orders. Check price fluctuations and try to set lower prices. You don't need all materials right now so you can wait a week or more for your delivery.
---
Also, make your focus on materials that are required first but don't neglect these that are last. I think all recipes require huge amount of t5 wood/metal at the start. A good source of those would be to make semi regularly some meta events that gives a lot of unid stuff (tariri, gerent, dragon stand).
---
There is lot to learn, and first lege is always least efficient. You may do some mistakes along the way or do greatly suboptimal farms, but it's all about having fun while doing it, no matter if you are getting closer to your lege by 2g or 50g every day. 
---
Thanks to gw2eff you will see your progress and this should motivate you the best.
---
&gt; I played Scourge in pvp. Still doing ok?
---
The meta is largely the same. Scourge is a top pick since day 1 of PoF.
---
Soulbeast really has only one trick: a ridiculously high burst damage. It makes it an excellent dps class for fractals, but it is relatively hard to pull off and the sustained damage isn't all that great, which make it a questionable choice for longer fights.
---
DH and Holo are both much more reliable, can be used literally everywhere except on condi bosses, offer excellent cleave, CC and (in the case of DH) utility.
---
It's been hinted at in the last raid, so fingers crossed we get it as a raidwing! Raid team would be the only team that does it proper justice, especially with how powerful Isgarren is starting to be built up as.
---
a theory towards the explanation behind all this, 250 years ago during nightfall, the dragons were still asleep, seeping out magic back into the world, so there wasnt as much uncontrolled wild magic around, 250 years later, base game releases, we look little bit shinier, more colourful in our designs, but the elder dragons are awake and hungry, the world has alot of magic again, then we kill an elder dragon.....then we get more shiny and flamboyant, then another dies......then we blow up a blood stone.....then we kill a god.....wild magic is kinda everywere now so much we literally pluck it out of the air in most areas, we also know magic kinda sends people little crazy "randomly popping up abnomalitys players see" 
---
whos to say we arnt all slowly going insane with magic drenched everywere hence the crazy looks or that theres so much magic compared to 250 years ago its just crazy not to have over to the shiny sparkly crap all over us :P
---
I will try that!
---
What masteries do you have?
---
I mean, if you cant suspend your disbelief for the wings working, how do you cope with the fact that there is **fucking** **dragons** to begin with?
---
I can't wait to just cling to random ceilings in LA for no reason... spiderpig... spiderpig...
---
I've always been ageinst mounts AS traditional ones simply weren't needed in gw2. I Bad an extra set with centaur runes for pve
---
will be used only for gaming and office stuff
---
Yeah the glyph is like 800g, close to price of the whole bundle lol.
---
Thanks so far. I added and lowered my expectations.
---
I do know that the performance varies a lot in WvW to Home Instance. I just wanted to have some nice graphics with still decent FPS. So I've change it in my post to "high settings with 30+ FPS".
---
We used to port to pvp lobby or wvw borderland and take the asura portal to LA just to avoid paying wp cost.
---
There used to be no ascended stuff, exotic being the top tier stats and legendaries having stats of exotics.
---
Exotics were also soulbound.
---
Also very true
---
Not to mention Anet themselves said they want this mount to look believable in terms of animations. You'd think the model would also reflect that somewhat, even for a fantasy creature.
---
I know. Been here since beta. But Ascended stuff started rolling in pretty soon tbh. Starting in november with rings and later backpieces. Aaahh. Simpler times. Sometimes i do wish to go back to August 25, 2012 to enjoy vanilla gw2 and do high school right lol
---
So a rant? Cause that is literally what a rant is
---
Yeah, but mounts turned out to be good for the game. Maps seem more populated because people travel from point A to point B on a mount because it's fun instead of 'waypointing'.
---
RNG golden ticket from new chocolate bar lootbox in the Gemstore.  
---
Wonderful.
---
(Tbh I hate both.)
---
for what it's worth i run alchemy hgh nowadays..mostly for elixir u and free boon duration(stacks nicely with other sources of concentration like some magic find foods)
---
you have like 80% quickness uptime solo which greatly helps if you plan to gather stuff like home instance or loot chests faster
---
Years ago, I used to have around 2000 chaos orbs I think when before the drop rate increase... I lost a lot of gold back then... The main reason I stopped paying and switched to lurking was the way anet used to screw with the economy.
---
I think it does less with less. It has environments that you can't actually explore. It is so incredibly linear in it's maps, environments can only be seen from a single angle, it only offers an illusion of being large. GW2 actually is large, allows you to explore and has maps that consist of more than a single layer.
---
They/you just *had* to squeeze both ass and boobs into a single angle D: [Escher Girls](https://eschergirls.tumblr.com/) says hi.
---
(But the art style looks good :) )
---
Chuckles in Hold the Line!
---
When they introduced the wardrobe, they didn't bother to migrate everything you've previously salvaged into it. So I lost so many skins becauee of it.
---
When people called Pharus reskin jt was understandable, but this?
---
I still keep a +25% movement speed signet on my characters (open world). I'm just way too used to it, professions without it feel sluggish.
---
Is it? I played 10 months as f2p and it was okay.
---
&gt; Anet blocking people in EU for using codes is breaking the law
---
Anet is not doing this per se. Buying legitimate codes at G2A will not get you banned. ANet is banning people that use codes the in the end cost Anet money due to chargebacks. What would be your choice in ANets shoes? Accept the chargeback fees as losses? Have the players pay those fees and risk possible collaboration with your (Anets) payment partners? I would favor the first, and am unsure about the risk of the latter.
---
&gt; Sim cards are not things that are tied to someone name and surname 
---
Rules and regulations concerning sim cards differ wildly from country to country.
---
Ranger means a keeper of nature, it has nothing to do with ranged weapons
---
Not sure if true but yea I heard upper management still give the go ahead that "thing" despite Sega telling them they are doing it wrong.
---
I generally feel the opposite, really.
---
Because of the mounts I don't feel as incentiviced to use waypoints nearly as much. It's not often, but I just go across the map on a mount instead of waypointing - not even using the gates.
---
Especially for Verdant Brink, I never understood what the map actually was untill I flew around with a mount. Part because it makes moving easier, I could use the rest of my attention to actually look at the map instead of constantly having to look down to fight mobs and where to go.
---
The way mounts make me look forward makes me look at the sky/ceiling far more often too. Otherwise I'm just looking down at the ground.
---
With dat backwards dodge
---
Salad Master race
---
Now watching this, imagine the possibilities it can open for this mount in the future content. I can't wait!!!!!
---
We need to go back
---
Daybreak: Unfinished Business is still bugged and doesnt award the achievement if Archon Iberu is killed
---
Imagine unironically thinking mounts outside HoT maps were a good idea.
---
but mostly The USA with their near 3rd world labor laws
---
a) it's obviously a joke
---
b) obviously when they say "just stand there and taking hits" they don't literally mean do absolutely nothing, as was shown in my vid, so the fact that this was a specific fight over 10 years ago doesn't actually matter
---
&gt;GW2 does a way better job of presenting the environment, culture, and people than GW1 did.
---
This is pretty much opposite that people think. Which im sure you know.
---
GW2 does better job with NPCs.
---
GW1 had more rich and diverse culture than GW2 has now. Maybe its due whole GW2 thing about "Joko made the culture to his will and one big mess".
---
GW1 had bit more diverse versions of different in-game cultures. Like Istan had way more "character" in culture than current Istan in GW2.
---
GW2 feels slightly like one culture vs "each "kingdom" has its own culture"
---
Because of this meme, my friends might finally play gw2 with me :')
---
Thank you.
---
it's got what mounts need!
---
Which, back when people were complete garbage and dungeons paid out fuck all, meant that stuff like Arah was usually a *loss* to run.
---
Incidentally, legendaries only being PVT.
---
Before the FGS wall bug, there was bear form wall bug. 
---
Bear form best form.
---
Also, remove shaking camera
---
Okay, except for the arachnophobia, this would have been awesome! (flying spiders are great in the abstract, but... not real ones, near me or visible to me!)
---
Talk to the skritt in LA cave. Or the guy in LA that should have "lost things", don't remember which one.
---
Cool, welcome welcome
---
I see it this way: the extra time it takes you to go through additional loading screens you could also use to easily make those 5s back and also be way less annoyed by having to spend so much time loading. This is why I never even think about porting anywhere anymore and it really feels way better.
---
I think they said that several teams wanted to do something with it, but they haven't decided who, if even anyone, gets to claim it for their type of content (open world, fractals, raids, story).
---
my guess is, exactly because it has been teased so long, they have a really high bar for when they eventually want to do something with it and as such it's probably difficult to decide.
---
[Obligatory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQvSbjjFvCY)
---
meh,too basic.
---
It would be a bit pointless since it would not show like with ranget pets.
---
But there could be ways to solve that, for example:
---
* Change character nameplates while riding, like "&lt;character name&gt; (riding &lt;mount name&gt;) [GUILD]"
---
* Add a new mastery to one of the mounts lines that only have 3. This new mastery would unlocks an elite skill to summon your currently selected mount for 30s in combat:
---
 * Raptor: Behaves like a mordrem mount, rushing to enemies pushing them out of its way, bitting and sweeping its tail.
---
 * Springer: Fights like a kangaroo, standing on its tail and kicking enemies. Will also occasionally do cannonballs on its own.
---
 * Skimmer: Heals allies and removes conditions when first summoned, then flies around circling the player that summoned it, healing over time before going away.
---
 * Jackal: Fights mostly like wolves, but will occasionally leap and splash tormented sands, causing Torment.
---
 * Griffon: Will fight like other griffons, taking flight, evading enemies, and swooping to knock them down.
---
 * Rollerbeetle: Will fight like GW1's beetles, with projectiles that weaken and interrupting enemies, and tanking with a surprisingly resilient armor. Will ocassionally roll in place throwing a barrage of rocks, and rarely do a Sonic-like attack, rolling in place and shooting at enemies.
---
 * Warclaw: Will fight like mordrem teragriffs, attacking with claws and horns and charging enemies. 
---
 * Skyclaw: Will do a wing buffed after being summoned, launching enemies away, then fight like wyverns, and ocassionally take flight and breath fire.
---
* Have stables in home instances or after adding housing, allow giving them names when they appear there.
---
* Add a Guild Hall Stables upgrade that adds a large area in which random mounts of guild members present in the guild hall would appear.
---
Oh god this hit too close to home
---
26. Remember GW2 projectiles are actually projectiles and can be obstructed by terrain. Ducking being rocks, trees, hill crests etc is a good way negate a portion of enemy damage.
---
27. Likewise the enemy needs to predict your location if moving. Moving erratically (ie mash strafe QEQEQEQEQ [default binds]) will cause most projectiles to go either side of you.
---
That's one of those coincidences that happens all the time.
---
God I love you
---
GW2 engine is pretty old, it can use only 1-2 cores and it doesnt matter how good your pc is, game will bottleneck it.
---
1000-1500 just for the pc or with monitor, keyboard etc?
---
Just PC
---
If you reuse storage no need for more than this

---
I've been playing since beta and I never once bothered with this, seemed ridiculous to me even then
---
Started playing when HoT came out, I remember finding sites with builds written like 0/25/69/666/42 and being like wtf is this shit
---
Gota move speed
---
Yeah I'm looking forward to that! Heh.. heh...
---
I know tempest thank worked like a charm so I'm sure Weaver tank works too somehow.
---
When you move the camera very fast the FOV gets lower and when you stop moving, it slowly returns back to normal. I think that's what you are perceiving as camera smoothing. I don't know if there is a fix for that.
---
then you severely lack imagination
---
Guild Wars 2 - Path Of Coachella
---
Just being curious: has ArenaNet contacted you for the performance improvements or multithreaded improvements? I mean you have done a lot of works in their stead to keep the game up for latest hardware capabilities.
---
Glossing over that legendary weapons started with no lore, most were added retroactively along with 3-4 new ones (Gen 2.0). Then the remaining gen 2.5 weapons again have next to no lore associated with them.
---
Sure you can make a couple connections yourself with a few of them, but theres nothing actually tying them in the game.
---
Some can feel really sluggish without it, but if you are able to keep up swiftness uptime with weapon skills it's basically useless except in long battles. When doing jumping puzzles though, without swiftness... oof, I need that speed to jump fast haha...
---
Your link broke a little

---
SURPRISE, BUBBLES IS HERE.
---
Yes, it's good, but the 2600x is oc version, so i recommend better cooler, maybe something from bequiet for am4 socket. 
---
Also mobo got 4 slots, i would take 4x4 not 2x8.
---
SSD is must have, so if you have one from old pc then good, if not go tor m.2 evo 128-256gb.
---
Also second monitor is a blast, is You are using only one, two makes HUGE difference, You dont have to alt tab for gw guides etc, you can watch streamers while playing yourself.

I love 21:9, there is nice lg/29c/2560x1080/ips/75hz monitor for like 200-300$.
---
Just google guild wars 2 21:9 gameplay video and check if You like it.
---
Thanks so much man, love the fps improvment!
---
One day I feel like making an animation of a whole raid fight scene vs raid bosses, featuring actual profession skills and animations with some artistic touch.  Throw in some gw2 raid music and call it a ~~day~~ decade.
---
Laughs in Runescape.
---
I've been enjoying your proxy since it was publicly released. As a mostly WvW player, i got about ~15fps more in busy scenarios, which makes all the difference between a playable game and a shitshow, while also being able to keep decent GFX settings.
---
I'm super glad that I can chain it to Reshade (and also glad Crosire is working on a DX12 hook!) so much so that i went ahead, installed visual studio and compiled it myself (15Gb of dependencies to spit out a 2Mb dll. Modern developing ftw... sigh)
---
I'm curious about how to properly setup config.ini, since the wiki is atm a little too technical for my understanding. For instance, upload_alloc_step defaults to 16 on my PC, was this calculated by the dll specifically for my hardware or is it just an arbitrary value that it starts with (in that case, why not 0?). tex_async is suggested to be between 5-10, but it's set to 0 as default, Would i wanna enable it? If so, why? And so on. Small things ofc, sice the proxy works great already.
---
According to my hardware (i5-4670k @4.6Ghz, RTX 2080), do you have any suggestion on how i could tinker with some of the settings in config.ini?
---
You can with practice. What armor weight do you use?
---
Linking the Wiki article of *meme*. That's bold, I like you.
---
I was wondering why there are no FPS improvements for me. Most of the time I even get weird stuttering and occasionally crashes. All with the added loading of shaders every time I switch maps. I was so hyped to get this and then it turned out like this. Also I don't properly get model previews (login screen and target health bar) if I set the game to use Supersampling.
---
What's wrong, do I need to do anything else?

---
Also extra config options allows you to offload construction of resources from calling thread for more overhead reduction.
---
I know, I googled the issue beforehand and just had another look at it, aswell as tested it in game. 
---
There is no smooth camera fix per se.  
---
Apparently, what youre experiencing could come from an old rendering trick where your FoV gets smaller while turning quickly, then re-expands;   
---
or from your setup slowing down while turning quickly then gaining back FpS once all parts are loaded. 
---
The issue is kind of foggy and will probably not be addressed by a dev on work schedule (never know About their free-time Projects though) since only a very minor amount of People seem to notice - so few in fact that, statistically, it might just be a bunch of people having local problems but blaming it on the game globally. 
---
Youll have to find Workarounds until that happens: 
---
* Get a mouse with high DPI, People report it made the issue unnoticable for them
---
* switch to ActionCam controls (set a button for switching in the game Settings) 
---
* or tinker around with your Computer settings
---
I also recommend you to try and get in contact with one of the devs over reddit or something, theyre really nice and understanding, and might be able to Forward the issue if it persists
---
this guy gets it ;)
---
WvW cost me money most of the time back then yeah.
---
Very basic version.
---
* Throughout the night, you can gather supplies and escort lost soldiers to camps.
---
* During the first half of the night, enemies will periodically attack camps, which need to be defended.
---
* During the second half of the night, choppers spawn at all held camps. Outer choppers go to central camps. The central camp for each daytime event chain has a chopper that takes you into the canopy, right next to a boss. Killing a boss gets you the meta reward chest with the Hero's Choice box.
---
In practice, most people her there when choppers/bosses are about to spawn, go up to Matriarch (located above the pact camp, easiest boss to kill) and get the chest before going and doing something else. Actually getting the map to t4 requires doing all the above activities fairly well, but since most of the rewards are from killing one boss those attempts are rare.
---
Huh, nice observation. But it seems like that it's not the FOV that gets lower, but the camera passes closer to your character. Seems like the interpolation (the "smoothness") is being applied not on camera's angle, but on camera's actual position. So if in one frame you move your camera such that it ends up being on the opposite side of your character, the camera won't interpolate AROUND your character while maintaining original distance, but it will fly THROUGH your character. This genuinely sucks and shows how little care was put into camera work
---

---
I just checked because I didn't know and my pre-searing Character is right before you choose a 2nd profession. So I can't answer that.
---
But what I also noticed is that I already died 37 times with that character so no survivor and  "Defender of Ascalon" for that character.
---
Season 2 takes place on two maps in "[Maguuma Wastes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Maguuma_Wastes)" which is different from "[Heart of Maguuma](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Heart_of_Maguuma)". Lots of story missions have very minor changes based on race and profession but they are all minor. HoT has the most changes if you are sylvari and you can always play through they story on another character later. I liked the details when I played through on my main (sylvari ranger) but don't feel like you're required to do it. Also I'd suggest upgrading your gear and build some if you're feeling under powered. You can get a full set of berserker armor cheaply with the [nika set](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nika%27s_armor), can [check here for more options and trinkets too](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character). Also maybe take some [build suggestions from here](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Ranger_-_Longbow_Beastmastery) (use it as an outline not a required build, swap things around to your liking but I would suggest trying out greatsword if you don't already have one)
---
Oh, longbow rangers getting kicked goes back a long time. The unfortunate thing is that you couldn't kick all those bearbows from open world, who would knock back any mob in exactly the moment you started some high damage melee skill.
---
The wings ruined it
---
getting that into their engine is up for their software engineers, no outsider can be more useful

---
Game still uses 2 cores heavily, adding mt features via proxy helps to take some load from one of them, but still, that cores will be utilized for 100%. 
---
Still locking FPS to single core performance in the end.
---
Yes it will help, but buying high single core performance CPU with many cores will help more.
---
*Guffaws in Hounds of Balthazar*
---
No offense, but you're wrong in suggesting the issue doesn't exist or is because of player's own hardware/software/environment. The camera is specifically coded to have interpolation, it's not a bug or a misperception, it's designed that way. Some people just value smoothness over usability, and I guess the people in charge of the camera programming (or feedback on it) in GW's engine thought that way. When I tried playing GW1 the camera there was EVEN MORE interpolated, to such an extent that it could be one of the factors that deters me from giving GW1 a fair chance. I imagine the camera's behavior in GW2 is a direct consequence to the way it worked in GW1 and few people complaining about it, although, to their credit, they did tone down the smoothness in GW2 considerably, or rather sped up the interpolation process a lot. But in my book it would've been ideal to get rid of interpolation entirely.
---
&gt; Apparently, what youre experiencing could come from an old rendering trick where your FoV gets smaller while turning quickly, then re-expands;
---
It's not a trick, it's poor coding, see [my comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bkjh0q/still_no_fix_for_camera_smoothing/emhathy/) above.
---
&gt; from your setup slowing down while turning quickly then gaining back FpS once all parts are loaded.
---
This only exeggerates the issue. But if you try playing with d912pxy, which removes the stutter by loading shaders asynchronously, the camera smoothness issue remains.
---
I mean, since we needed Aurene to properly diffuse, I'm not sure we'll manage to do so in the next episode... If we kill him and let his magic get freely absorbed,  it's kind of the end of Tyria
---
probably, but it'd still be a terrible idea
---
Thanks! I'll do a single run with the ele then, and then replay HoT with the Sylvari one I've enough masteries.
---
Why is that tho?
---
They can’t sell you mount skins if you walking across water like Jesus and running as fast as sonic.
---
So let me get this straight, as  a returning player and all: 
---
I can just stop doing HoT for a touch, go do the living world story, and get a damn DRAGON.
---
Yeaaaah, I can see that.
---
Doesn't it unbind one of the legendaries now if you bring two to the npc?
---
I approve of human fox hybrids.
---
I've already the Nika set and i'm using the bearbow build, but I've created my ranger to use bows. Playing with a GS using basically only GS1/2/3 (and occasionally 5) and without utility skills (because shouts are just "passive" abilities on you) feels underwhelming.
---
At least with the Ele I'm switching attunements and the utilities are fun (glyphs/conjure etc)
---
Maclaine only continuated everything what Jeremy soule started and gave GW2 more ambience. We still don't know who is going to be the main composer, but I hope Brendon Williams is, because I can see him as a great continuator, and a young spirit that can bring something even more original, like more choir music - peaceful and epic, he has a great experience in choir music, unlike Maclaine.
---
F2p doesn't have shared slot.

Do I fresh install this version or simply replace the dll file only ?
---
It is the reason thief became my main. It was so much faster to travel with shortbow 5.
---
We already have million waypoints. What would a flying change about the traveling experience?
---
That's kinda frustrating, both from a GW2 player and a developer point of view. You're doing great work to improve this game, great unpaid work. The least Anet could do is acknowledge what you've done so far, imo.
---
Thanks for this great tool my man.
---
ThatsTheJoke.jpg
---
I tried this out yesterday and found I *lost* about 20fps in places. I don't think this happened with previous builds. Any reason as to why this might have happened?
---
Tnx die thé info.
---
Interesting to read. Yes, I'll be very careful who I socialise with in the game in future. Thank you.
---
They have a limited number of whispers.
---
I've created the topic and gone to sleep. Was this downvoted? Lol. If it is i'm starting to think that there is an algorithm error with this subreddit that makes people randomly downvote the threads.
---
Ooooooor, the subreddit is full of PvP players heheheh..
---
That dragon hunter looks so dam sleek
---
My prediction skill is too low right now. Can't say for sure with so little input.
---
Better to fresh install.
---
I've tried a couple times with my human necro and mesmer, results were not satisfying so i gave up on it.
---
I think your attitude here is a faulty one. 
---
Just because a great mod/hack is created by the community doesnt mean its something Anet could or Should implement themselves. Im sure they are very thankful for u/megai2's work, and who knows, perhaps they have their over version of it in the pipeline.
---
But to ask if Anet has contacted him since he "Has done lots of work for Anet without getting paid" is kinda silly. It doesn't help that your original question seemed to lean towards him giving code to Anet, and your response being leaning towards Anet not giving him any acknowledge at all.
---
If you feel frustration over this that would most likely just be of your own making, and it really looks like you are trying to badmouth Anet over this.
---
They have become very common in pug raids recently. From what I could tell most of them are good players that get tired of not having might/quickness/heals so they go for a more selfsufficient class. Do give them a chance before kicking or not joining, you might be surprised.
---
Flesh wurm is incredible in open world and for skips in fractals with the xera portal. It can also block projectiles in boss fights
---
Yes.  You will need PoF masteries which you gain in similar ways like mastery points and achievements (done in the Pof maps).
---
The only thing I don't like about acquistion stuff is tying it to events and then just sitting around waiting for them to happen.
---
Can i update or do i have to reinstall it?
---
You can use effect shoulders, it wont hide those (showflake and bats shoulders)
---
The game is like Marvel cinematic universe. Core game and expansions are Avengers movies, consider them a big finale and seasons are events leading to them, like the movies inbetween the Avengers.
---
Yeah, they are super convenient. Though imho for the first playthrough everyone should experience the maps as originally intended.
---
&gt; there are less players on activities in central Tyria, and the most rewarding ones are in expansions rn as i can see
---
For actual farming Silverwastes (accessible with core game) is still one of the best options.
---
Back in the day when the game was more realistic and gold was not shared between characters and you had to deposit the gold from all your characters in the bank before you could buy something expensive ... shivers
---
What do you mean with 
---
&gt; Lower FPS if you have no extra CPU power / GPU power 
---
As in gw2 is Single or dual core threaded right ? do you mean if this / these cores are already maxed you dont have any extra power left ?
---
Or is it fine if i have like 16 threads and 2 getting maxed normally?
---
They're basically saying Anet went with the bog standard fantasy flying mount, which is true. A dragon is pretty bog standard.
---
You compare Amnoon to Kamadan, not the same location.
---
How long does it last?
---
I like Ryzen, but for MMOs you want as much single core performance as possible which does mean Intel (preferably overclockable), not AMD. Depends what resolution you're planning on gaming at, but for a 1080p60 display a 2070 is way overkill.

Feel free to move the GPU up/down depending on what resolution you're planning on playing at. I would also echo /u/DGG95's recommendation of an SSD, but I would disagree with their recommendation to get 4 sticks of RAM. It stresses the memory controller more to use more sticks, so on Ryzen it makes it harder to clock the memory as high. Intel doesn't have this issue, but regardless it still locks you out of upgrading to 32GB of RAM without providing any benefit (outside of not having empty RAM slots looking weird). 2*8 is the better choice for mainstream Intel/AMD platforms.
---
Fresh install. NVidia GTX 750ti (not great but can handle Witcher 3 and Fallout 4). 16gb ram. 3.90GHz across 4 cores (again, not great but can handle PS4-era games). I'm not computer savvy enough to know what would help, sorry.
---
I think it's a great project and want to support, but this was the first time I've seen a drop in FPS.
---
So I finally managed to make the Shining Blade legendary, but didn't realise that it plays the mechanical sound all the time (including when dismounting...)- is there any way to turn the noise off?
---
You're joking yourself if you don't think mount skins were a large part of introducing mounts.
---
You can always stat change your ascended in the forge if needed for the new spec. That said most "meta" builds are using berserker gear :)
---
Can confirm. I run gw2 on a 4k monitor with an i7-4770K @3.5GHz and a GTX 980. Thanks to d912pxy, my CPU is at around 34% whilst my GPU is maxed out.
---
In my case, I would most likely get some perf increase by getting a better GPU (not to mention the GTX 9xx series were barely optimized for 4k).
---
Exclusive to DRK.
---
Can't glam onto PLD or WAR.
---
What does T4 mean and how do you get it to T4?
---
I did something similar the past weeks after I returned. For weapons the specialisation collections are a good way to get ascended weapons. The named sunspear weapons for the PoF collection got much cheaper now, the mystic weapons for the HoT ones more expensive. Maybe you already have some of the mystic weapon skins unlocked, like it was the case for me. That makes the HoT weapons cheaper. For PoF and core stat back pieces I would recommend the PoF story back piece collections. For HoT stats farming some winter berries in Bitterfrost Frontier was my go to way. Because I didn't want to spent laurels for ascended trinkets I used the LS3 map currencies to buy them. Armor is a bit more difficult to get if you don't want to craft it. I was lucky and had enough PvP shards and raid shards to buy armor from vendors. I also completed the let line armor collection for an armor box. The luminescence armor collection also rewards one. Additional armor boxes dropped in T4 fractals.
---
could you share the raw data you used to create this summary?
---
Thank you³...this is an entirely new game to me with this seemingly little thingy. Stupid question: how do I upgade from an older verstion to the latest? Just overwrite files?
---
Good question...does Anet still do a large AMA after a LW release? This should be top tier question.
---
 Thats what i was told when i wanted to get a Intel possible to overclock

If this program introduces one crash per minute it's not acceptable, but if it introduces one crash per billion years it is. Somewhere in the middle is a threshold where you say good enough.
---
Anecdotally the early versions of the proxy were quite unstable, but it's been at least 200 hours of gameplay since I last had a crash and it was an older version of the proxy that was running then. I would say that that is low enough to detract less from the overall impression of quality than the poor performance does.
---
Didnt mean it wasnt annoying
---
General Practitioner.
---
That's exactly the issue!! We are among those who can perceive the acceleration/deceleration, and it truly is PITA.
---
I want an I-Win button in PvP and a /kill command for raids
---

---
Leveling up and unlocking new random skins added an extra level of excitement in PvP because you never knew the value or rarity of the skin you would get. Then you had the PvP locker to store it in. I definitely miss it. I regret not trying to unlock more skins before the wardrobe update, especially since my Wings of Dwayna skin was from the PvP locker system.
---
Mate you lose about 25% of your hp over 3 seconds on a 16k hp pool class with medium armor. No need to be such a crybaby about it.  Yes there are way safer classes like necro or warrior but there is nothing “high risk high reward” about holo except for the condi holo’s hard rotation that can provide solid dps and exceptional cc and utility.
---
No. Just no.
---
It's in a very different price point to what you first listed and what I made so it's not really comparable. 
---
Going up to 8 CPU cores isn't gonna make any meaningful difference in performance in GW2 (If it used multiple cores well we wouldn't be having this conversation). The H115i is good, but very expensive. ASUS has the best UEFI interface of any mobo but their hardware for Z390 is incredibly lacklustre; I would recommend whichever Gigabyte Aorus Z390 board fits your budget, the Aorus Elite would work fine here. 
---
If you like the case that's fine; personally I'm not a fan of how it looks and it's more expensive than I could justify recommending but the case is mostly personal preference. 
---
The Focus+ is decent electrically but is fairly loud. The RMx I recommended is substantially quieter. You don't need 650W here; 550W is fine, but given that you have a 1500 EU budget it's not going to matter much either way.
---
so how much AP you got?
---
Exactly!
---
Istan, Kourna, Vabbi were all inspired from different African cultures and they all have their own assets. You don't find Kournan campments and buildings in Istan afaik, same for the other regions. They managed to really make each areas distinctives despite being "one big desert".
---
As a fan of African arts and cultures, GW2 was a bit of a let down. It gives the impression Anet sent for a big unified "Elona" in its architecture instead of paying attention to its subdivision. There are some small exceptions, like the Sunspear Hall or the Vabbi palaces, but you still find the same generic "beige square-shaped desert houses" or that "African tent" in all PoF+LS4 maps. The styles are more diluted in GW2 and because of that, my favorite content lost its characters and charms.
---
T4 = Tier 4
---
Every HoT meta has progress bars that fill up as the event completes, with different tiers along the way that increase the final rewards when the meta-event ends. Tier 4 is when you completely fill the bar, earning max rewards. For AB, TD, and DS, it's a simple process: defeating all four octovines, all four Gerents, or the Mouth of Mordremoth will automatically fill the progress bar to max.
---
VB is trickier. Defeating all 5 night bosses isn't enough to hit t4 on its own. Though each gives a significant chunk, you have to do a lot of other work to fill up the rest of the progress bar. Almost anything you do (defending camps, gathering scattered supplies, escorting soldiers, or defeating random veteran enemies that spawn) adds a tiny amount of progress, so basically it boils down to needing to do a lot of those events before and potentially after killing the night bosses. Keeping enough camps defended in particular takes a lot of organization and is very important to a successful run.
---
It's also generally not worth it. It mostly takes way more time for a slight increase in crowbars and airship parts. It used to be the only way to get Bladed coats, but while it still gives you a guaranteed Bladed armor box when you hit T4, you can also get random coat boxes just for killing one boss, or just farm reward tracks for it, so there's much less incentive than there used to be.
---
The person I declined to help again was like, in short, the REEE meme guy. I got over 20 crazy messages after  I declined, probably the most crazy person I've ever met in the game. People who knew him told me that I was quite unfortunate. I hope this will be solved. thank you.
---
Also anecdotally, I get occasional crashes at the launcher and after periods of inactivity (with the latest version, clean install).
---
I still use it of course, but there it is.
---
Wrong, LS3 is the best investment for:
---
- Better maps (imo some of the bests in the game)
---
- Diverse maps (half of LS4 are deserts)
---
- Useful farming (you can farm stat selectable ascended trinkets as well as a legendary one)
---
- Awesome skins (houndskin mantle, glacial gloves etc)
---
On the other hand, LS4 does have the beetle as well as a dragon in next release so I'd recommend:
---
- Buy the Kourma episode for beetle
---
- Get the current and next release for free by logging in
---
- Buy the Bitterfrost frontier episode
---
- Buy the Bloodstone fen episode
---
- Buy the Draconic mons OR Sandsewpt isles
---
- Buy one for the skins you like (ex Lake Doric)
---
Unless you go for a pack, I believe LS3 is in discount soon
---
I've been playing for a while now and I'd really like to focus on a class to get good at to play T4 fractals and start raiding with. I have a full set of ascended medium armour (berserker stats) and trinkets, and was wondering what you'd recommend out of soulbeast, holosmith or deadeye/daredevil to practice with. 
---
Thanks!
---
Generally it's better to salvage/sell because you always gain something from it. MF is a gamble so either you lose a lot or you gain a lot.
---
\&gt; Just because a great mod/hack is created by the community doesnt mean its something Anet could or Should implement themselves. I'm sure they are very thankful for [u/megai2](https://www.reddit.com/u/megai2)'s work. 
---
I agree with the first point but its not like there's nothing for Arenanet to learn from what the community releases. If there's a mod that's created that the community enjoys it usually points to an actual issue with the game. Right now the game is running on DX9, anybody who downloads this program for use (much less creates the actual program) most likely has an issue with DX9 or simply just wants to use DX12 for running the game. Looking at that A-net would be able to see there's a demand for DX12 support. Also, we would never know if they're thankful for his work because they haven't addressed it or it's creator. This is probably the frustration that comment was referring to. 
---
\&gt; "Has done lots of work for Anet without getting paid" 
---
He never said that. He was complimenting the creator for the work he invested while not being paid to do it, then calling out A-net for not having more involvement on a mod that's had a larger impact than most. Just his opinion, no need to tell the guy to change his attitude.
---
As a developer, contacting another developer, even though that code is “from external source”, saying thanks or just keeping in touch is a good attitude to have. Even if the code you said introduce instability, it is undeniable that u/megai2’s work is like helping the ArenaNet’s game to stay alive, or at least stay relevant to the latest hardware.
---
they probably have great speedclear strats for mine 10 chunks of mithril in orr though
---
&gt;If you feel frustration over this that would likely be of your own  making, and it really looks like you are just trying to badmouth Anet  over this. 
---
The frustration I feel when running this game and not reaching 60 fps on modern hardware with a 1080 is not one of my own making.
---
It's 100% Anets fault and when a single dev can improve the game more over the last few months than Anet over the last years we should chill with the anti Anet attitude?
---
What the hell are you smoking to feel this content?
---
At nightfall hair dyes, cosplay and animes was yet to be invented.
---
Damn, guess I gotta start playing on another account.
---
Just a matter of taste.  Personally I haven't ever paid attention to the story of GW or GW2, but factions is probably my favorite experience out of any of the games because of the environments and music.  I find Shing Jea Island to be especially magical.
---
How does this not bother you?
---
Best advice right now is to wait a month or two until Ryzen 3000 series is out. No reason to buy Intel or AMD Ryzen 2000 with those about to come out and if rumors are true they will beat all the current intel chips in even single core. Rumors are rumors though but still better to wait.
---
That being said, you didn't mention resolution but I'm going to assume 1080p. I play the game at 1920x1080 with an AMD Ryzen 1600X, 3200Mhz RAM, GTX 1060 6GB. I have everything on max with the exception of model limits at low/medium and shadows at high. 30FPS is my floor with the majority of the non-big group content being played at 45-60FPS (FPS capped at 60 but some maps hits 100-150 when uncapped). Zergs, WvW, World Bosses, 95% of the time is 30-40FPS with occasional drops to 25-30 for a few seconds at the start of world bosses and when just way to many particle effects going on.
---
As far as playing with everything maxed out, including character models at max and 30FPS in big groups? I honestly don't think that is possible with any hardware the public is allowed to buy.
---
Ill be honest, PoF made me quit gw2.
---
I know some people love it, but I cleared out the story in a day and just did not fall in love with any of the elite specs.  I expected it to have so much more content and meh.. I dunno.  I havent played in awhile, ill eventually hop on when a new expansion comes out
---
Nice one - where is it ?
---
When this mount can be used at WvW to burn enemies?
---
OHHH NOOOOOO!!!! I can't look at in the same now! 😂🤣😭🔥🤢
---
Get mad irl
---
Your name tells me Daredevil is the way to go
---
There is actually no clipping what so ever in any way at all.
---
You like to project don't you....
---
To each their own I guess
---
lol
---
specifically, how do i get past the Coherent64 error?
---
But daily revive was easy then ;-)
---
Leech and stat steal is mainly a necro thing. Other classes don't really have that.
---
Remove folder d912pxy -&gt; copy new one -&gt; install.exe and enjoy using again.
---
Don't really care for the story but are there any items you can only get if you own LS2?
---
You can try. Some people say it worked for them in the past
---
Ah darn. I wanted to give the key to my friend.
---
&gt; It's likely to be 3-rd party tools TOS compliant.
---
From the post itself.
---
Awesome, thanks. I put in a ticket. I just came back to the game after 5 years so those extra gems would come in handy!
---
It is the same tool, but it never sent data over the internet but had used a logging library that may have not been needed and had been declared safe like a day later.
---
They are worth to buy. 
---
In maps you will get access to there are meta events and stuff that could give you access to ascended gear.
---
I want to be a holo and Dh main, but I'm one of those weird folks who value under water combat and DH is missing too many skills when wet.
---
I donno about that part either... It feels like 90% of the skills available are either straight up inferior or aren't worth slotting. Looking at those recommended builds on the wiki you tend to see a whole lot of overlap / the same skills being used.
---
Making a build definitely has a different feel to it in than in GW2. GW2 feels a bit more constrained with weapon choices and gear stats equipped playing just as important (if not moreso) role than your spec/utility choices, though to be fair GW1 had a bit of that too with weapon-based skills. Granted, most content is easy enough to not worry about minmaxing in GW1 so long as you're above some kind of threshold with cleanses/heals/interrupts and then praying they  don't do stuff to get themselves killed.
---
LWS2 Episode 6 gives out one Black Lion Key for each character on completion.
---
by giving them guidelines?
---
If you ever want GW2 Ascalon to have more of a pre-searing vibe, there is a graphical mod I use to boost the greens and dampen the yellows/oranges throughout the landscape.
---
Thanks! I mostly don't try to use outfits, but for the ones I do have I put them on those whose outfit's are not done or good enough yet in my opinion. Or they haven't been levelled and I'll be replacing the armour constantly.
---
Ooh I’m gonna have to update, I love this thing it makes WvW a much better experience for me.
---
Sure!
---
Dyes: Robin, Gold, Flare, Hydrangea, Ancient Silver, Golden Sheen, Enameled Sky, Daybreak
---
Set:
---
* Head - Winged Headpiece 
---
* Shoulders - Braham's Wolfblood Pauldrons 
---
* Chest - Wolf Vest 
---
* Gloves - Foefire Wraps (going to replace with Heavenly Bracers when I grind GW1)
---
* Legs - Predatory Leggings 
---
* Boots - Wolf Boots
---
* Backpiece - Light of Dwayna
---
* Glider - Feathers of the Zephyr
---
* Weapons - Dwayna's Longbow + Dwayna's Greatsword + Dual Luminous Dirks
---
It's my favourite backpiece/wings! I'm using the Roaring Dragon as a glider right now, it makes a nice transition from the wings.
---
I think that has more to do with GW2 presenting a more modern take on a world as opposed to a medieval(ish)-era fantasy.
---
I know plenty of adults that throw tantrums or play all loveydovey. I know plenty of adults who are overbearingly sarcastic (Canach) and snarky (Taimi) or fit other archetypes presented by extended cast like Logan or even Phlunt. I know very few who are stoic and serious all the time.
---
... Also Koss is very much memey in GW1. Maybe I just haven't reached a point where he becomes more serious yet, but yeah definitely more comic relief than serious in tone. 
---
I haven't done much in EotN yet, so I'll have to wait and see. My very limited experience so far is that the Asurans exist for goobers and the Norns exist for drunken brawling and hunting. The tone set by the lines during The First Vision (re: lucky, I guess), felt kind of goofy so I'm not expecting much along the lines of a serious tone for this story.
---
Updated the album with the dyes if anyone is interested :)
---
But why make a translator when you should go for native support.
---
11k if i remember correct
---
Implementing a hack vs implementing something that Anet takes responsibility for, has to test extensively and will affect only part of the players might not be as easy as you think. 
---
This addon is great and deserves the highest praise, but it is not at all surprising ANet has not done anything about that yet. Maybe they will once win7 will discontinue support and most users will move to win10.
---
Yet somehow [this](https://i.redd.it/69y5xd38j1w21.jpg) is more accurate, right?
---
Maybe OP should have just added a rose tint to the Nightfall screencap :\^)
---
but, yeah, that Kamadan screencap does not present the environment design fairly because they're just looking at the floor and people. here's [a more scenic shot](https://i.imgur.com/xVtBThO.jpg) from that same location for comparison and [another with a waterfront setting](https://i.imgur.com/jRmEGJk.jpg) from that same general area. GW1 did fairly well within the limitations it had for that era, though at the same time it's not particularly impressive when compared to other competitors on the market from that time period (like WoW which came out over a year prior) — and these screenshots are from a few minutes ago with the benefit of visual improvements they've made since release.
---
Play what you like and what keeps you coming back to the game! I think play tempest right now and maybe find a guild that would be more receptive to playing group content with a "not meta" build. Eventually, I would try weaver since it opens up new possibilities and is a different playstyle. But in general, for story, open world completion, farming, and dungeons, meta don't matter much.
---
Impressive work.
---
Im using the crystal outfit, the wings, bifrost on my charr and i love being a crystal kitty :3
---
Wouldn't that be kind of pointless? GW2's Amnoon is waaaaaaaaaay evolved from GW1's and Kamadan is like a studio flat compared to Palawadan. Say what you will about Joko, but he expanded the heck out of that place. Thematically GW1's Kamadan compares to GW2's Amnoon as both a central starting point for the players and an effective capital for the region.
---
I don't see it that way because it's not true. I don't make 5s in 15-20 seconds. What's going on in this subreddit that people act like money is raining from the sky? Is it because I don't do raids yet, is that making everyone rich?
---
Remember to use the official retailers, [&gt;&gt;list here&lt;&lt;](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/), to prevent any complications when buying the game. ArenaNet cannot help you with unauthorized sellers and using fraudulent keys can lead to account being suspended.

Responded to someone else in this thread about it too:
---
[GW1's Amnoon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYGVyOyzpaE) is not very comparable to GW2's Amnoon. Kamadan is a better comparison point because in GW1 it serves more or less the same purpose as GW2's Amnoon: an effective capital of the region and the player's starting point.

---
Thanks Mr. Bot
---
you'll be waiting a few years, if it comes out at all. they don't seem to like releasing expansions for some reason
---
Nightfall felt less..hipster.  Not saying PoF is bad, but I will say new Elona is bad.
---
Can you post a pic? I'd love to see it!
---
Your face is funny.
---
&gt;He already has cooler, ssd, hdd, psu and case. So it's a waste of 300$.
---
His budget is $1000.
---
Also, do I really have to do everything ! he has eyes.
---
he can remove what he already has himself.
---
I really wanna see what that looks like, care to share?
---
don't build your pc around gw2 if you are planning to use it for other games too. gw2 is going to run badly no matter what PC you buy
---
No, it's not sadly.
---
I had to send them gold and have them convert to gems.
---
you could try this [https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy) it should help with " Shader loading done in async way, which fixes lag-spikes on camera moves. "
---
By the way I would actually wait 2 or 3 months for 3rd generation of ZEN CPUs.
---
Anything that makes the game bad it makes me happy. Thank you for your service sir.
---
Here's a simple piece of advice for you.  You say you have a guild but aren't active when they're on.  So why not find another guild?
---
You can be a member of up to five guilds at once.  So you can stay in your current guild if you have sentimental reasons or if they're non-WvW players, but join a second guild for WvW purposes, a third guild for raid training, and a fourth guild for roleplay or fashion wars or whatever else you might be interested in.
---
Berserker gear can work for both Dragonhunter and Quickbrand, it would just be locking you out of the condi-damage focused burning Firebrand build.
---
I would like to sell this PC a as whole and start over with everything anyway...any idea for how much I can sell this one? THe GPU, SSD, MB and power supply are kinda new the cpu, ram and HDD are  4years old
---
&gt;By the way I would actually wait 2 or 3 months for 3rd generation of ZEN CPUs.

This is true, doing this myself as my aging 2700K system starts to give me problems.
---
&gt; You might not have the extra CPU power
---
Yeah, I missed that the first time round. Thanks

---
it is a really old system none the less.
---
You won't get that much for it, I suggest using it as a media center or network storage server instead.
---
I think WvW players would be interested.
---
can confirm, that is an idea.
---
fun fact: not every idea is reasonable or even worth sharing.
---
Getting a straightforward response that doesn't prance around the issue is considered offensive these days? The tone of my voice is perfectly fine, thank you very much. You, on the other hand, might benefit from not outright assuming other people are not experiencing issues if you aren't experiencing them yourself. Suggesting random tangentially-related solution is fine, but if challenged, don't go on the defensive if you have nothing concrete to defend. Does that sound offensive enough? Good, because this time it was meant to be.
---
&gt; Alltogether this looks like a design decision, although questionable, it probably works better for teleport skills.
---
Up until a few years ago camera teleports were always instantaneous. But ANet has since added an option to apply interpolation to teleports as well (see "Enable Camera Teleportation" option which reenables the old behavior). Interpolation on camera rotation, however, was always present.
---
&gt; so I assume high DPI might actually make a difference
---
For the sake of argument, I tried changing mouse DPI from 800 to 100 and increasing rotation speed all the way up to compensate. As expected, it made no difference, and the interpolation is still there and still as noticeable. Same without changing rotation speed. Same with changing mouse report rate from 1000 Hz to 125 Hz.
---
It's more a matter of people now knowing how it should (or, rather, can) work and just accepting what they have as the only and the perfect way of doing things. Same as when people think that playing with low FOV is completely fine and in no way restrictive. The number of downvotes of this thread proves that.
---
I'm full up on guilds, sadly, though the 5th slot is debatably able to be changed. Personal spare bank for mats, a social guild with my online friends, my primary guild (which does everything) and community event running setup. Sorry. long story. 
---
I'll see where I can find a guild that fits my timezone... I guess I'd need an oceanic/SEA guild given my timezone. 
---
Thanks for the reminder and the quickbrand thing. I'll study up on that.
---
Basically. Just a matter of if you want to bother for the stuff that doesn't matter anyways.
---
The charr looks really good, but by making your model look this pretty and shiny you're kinda showing how shitty anets attention to charr armor is xD
---
What about world completion, when you still needed to do WvW maps. Took me 3 weeks for one poi :|
---
Low effort karma farming shitpost :/
---
NA.
---
Then I missed the joke. My bad. Thought we were just talking about useless skills people used in open word.
---
No, your face is funny. It’s like a little raisin.
---
Right in the nostalgia ;-;
---
Short version: there was something in it that *could* be used to send data over the internet (among other thing), but it's been looked at now it's open-source and the consensus is that it's safe. 
---
The launch of the tool was *awful* on both sides, but the developer handled it after the initial shock and has been really communicative and open.
---
With Carapace, everything but the legs can be bought or dropped from the Silverwastes area. According to the wiki, you need LW2 to get the legs: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Carapace_Legging_Box
---
That would trivialize the entire game.
---
If you mean the Fractal Encryptions - no I think you're fine these chests have the same drops no matter the level.
---
I'm wondering the same thing. Irregardless of AP, some groups just don't go well together... unless you can single out one specific person.
---
It’s almost like douchebags will use anything to enable their own doucebaggery.
---
Whereas others will use tools for self improvement/team improvement
---
&gt;(and also glad Crosire is working on a DX12 hook!)
---
Does this mean that Crosire is going to update gw2hook? Or do you mean something else?
---
Snowcrows.com is the goto raid build website, if you go for meta builds (often the case). They also have several links to discord servers (under community) that offer regular training (Raid Academy is the busiest one right now).
---
Ty for this, I breezed through the instructions on the dev site because I had already read them a few times from various posts. To be clear I'm not new and I still find it annoying when someone in the party starts complaining about low dps from another player. Usually their own dps isn't great either, and it seems like they're just trying to preemptively point the finger
---
You've done the best thing you can do. Which was contacting support. They will get to you when they can.   
---
Reddit isn't Support (Rule number 4)  
---
Definitely do what Assic suggested with your passwords on everything else.
---
.4. Use the sms authentificator.
---
Then what are we talking about? Most bosses, tanking just means positioning the boss in the right spot with not much else to it. Enough knowledge about the boss and you can do it on just about any role. The only bosses that are somewhat complicated to tank IMO are Xera and maybe Deimos. Maybe VG if you're doing edge.
---
But even then, distortion and aegis are really nice to have while tanking and no other classes can really come close to Chrono or FB in that regard.
---
Guys, scratch alliance! We will do raptors now!
---
It will probably be tied to a collection (or several) like the rollerbeetle. So it will need a little bit of time and effort, but not much gold like the griffon.
---
It's easier to be infamous than famous. Try being such a jerk that everyone knows you.
---
That's comparing Kamadan with Amnoon, though. It would've been more accurate if OP had compared Amnoon from GW1 with Amnoon from GW2, or Kamadan with Palawadon.
---
Same. I dont have an install.exe. There also isnt one on the github page so its not my antivirus eating it. I'm missing something
---
Ugh it hurts, so true.  Pretty much trying to Skyrim your way up a mountain to get a fucking Vista...good times.
---
Did you take what they said about " ...enable their own doucebaggery." personally? There are better ways than others to discuss player performance. Maybe I just have low standards for T4 pug grps, 30min or less for all the T4s is a good run imo. So long as things are done is a certain time frame im pretty lax about everyones performance.
---
Except anet has confirmed some are.
---
I'm still *just* jumping back into GW2 and the both of the expansions (got my raptor last night!!)
---
When it comes to Fashionwars 2, would I need to buy a bunch of xmute stones, or is there a free way to use certain skins?
---
Also, where the heck is everyone getting the unique looking gear? Is everyone just buying it?
---
dunno, but in good old runescape days and with all the hacks that happened there, they should be, SHOULD BE able to determine the original owner just by looking at IP history. if they track it, that is. tldr, just wait but expect to have 0 gear/mats and things like that. Tho who tf would salvage gear, you get jackshit for it...
---
Just as an fyi, fire aura seems to have a lot of broken trait interactions atm, so you might want to check that it works properly.
---
Having to talk to Profession Trainers to purchase tiers of traits.
---
Also, that strange brief period of having to do open world content to unlock traits (or pay for them)

35k ap here, stopped doing fractals about 2 years ago, i still raid every so often but far from the best. I play this game to enjoy myself, i dont play this game to grind hard at min/maxing myself.

Well. Finished episode 5, while the armour may change at a later date my colour scheme definitely did for my main. [Before and after the trauma](https://imgur.com/HM1E4N0)
---
So in path of fire there's only 2 raid wings? This means omly 2 bosses or 2 whole raids?
---
Death by jungle raptor is Maguuma's official intiation/hazing ritual.
---
Boon [Renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/alacrity) is way better tbh since you can in practice keep up 100% Alacrity on your team + Might, Protection etc.
---
Rev is quite fun and perfectly fine in open world (as all classes), however it has a lot less variety due to the way the utility skills come together with the legends.
---
My personal recommendation is and will probably always be engi
---
&gt; why isn't the druid tanking on most bosses?
---
Because a chrono with 1005 toughness sacrifices virtually nothing, and is still a much safer tank than a full minstrel druid.
---
Yeah, true.
---
Of course it's cool when it's a new thing. But once the honeymoon period is over, sailing miles above any actual content, and making a bigger rmess of map breakouts / JP skips etc is too much.
---
I don't really care for wow, never had, but I am glad that ge2 can learn from what it does well, and what is best avoided.
---
your question didn't inspire awareness at all. You're welcome ;)
---
Looks good !!  nice job!  I kinda want one now too
---
from your comment I got the impression that if you not getting a speed clear level performance from your pug group its a bad run, and thats your baseline for what is or isnt a burden on a team.
---
I enjoy Renegade a ton for Revenant. I love healing people and giving them alacrity with it while also having the option of going straight DPS.
---
Idea: put warclaw skins into the regular mount adoption packs/give other lower than 2k options for some single skins?
---
They selected a cinematic/vista for Gw2 and a camera down look for GW1. 
---
I don't think OP cares about thematics, they just wanted to make a snipe at the graphics differences between a 13 year old game that lots of people have Nostalgia Vision for, and a 2 year old game that covers the same region.
---
The primary open world changes from LS2 beyond Prosperity (which was only 'intact' for about two weeks of real time, but did have a live Drooburt and the human personal story NPC Riot Alice present) are in Kessex Hills, Timberline Falls and Iron Marches.
---
In Kessex Hills, Fort Salma was overrun by vines, the waypoint inside it moved to the outside.  In Timberline Falls, Fort Concordia was likewise attacked, though it held up a little better than Fort Salma did.  And in the Iron Marches, it was hit in several areas, leaving new events to fight off Mordrem in several parts of the map and large vines growing through it.
---
Guardian. If you are new and just want to PvE content, the utility and burst of a DH is amazing.
---
It’s in their head based on their limited observations.
---
I think you can hit 100% utilization of your hardware using default client. 
---
Maybe some system cleanup and optimization will help.
---
Also 2GB VRAM can be a problem, depending what resolution and settings you use.
---
Wow
---
You've made all scholar classes try soldier or adventurer types. The best question to ask yourself is what is your play style? Then you should decide by reading the  [Specializations](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Specialization). For instance lets choose [Ranger Profession](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Profession) \- there are 7 specializations in all and each one of them offer you a small description of what the spec is about. Do you know what kind of play style you want or like? You should decide your future class based on the specs. 
---
I like being able to fight up close and stay mid range when needed while using deterrents when I'm at range until they bleed to death. I chose skirmishing for it boost shortbow and it offers me condition damage trap boost. Wilderness survival is compatible because it offers torch and dagger boost-it also gives me even more power with condition damage. With soulbeast I'm able to boost my stats further by melding with them and they add 3 more skills in my rotation. There are more than 20 pokemon to choose from and some can be a 2nd heal skill. 
---
Something like that..thats how you should decide your next class. You should invest "SOME" time rather than just choosing what people chose for you because in the end its your enjoyment that matters. The most you can do search for it on your own.
---
Do a clean install.
---
What a waste their decision to scrap and overwrite content is one of the dumbest in gaming history.
---
That would likely entail also disabling dismount jump on raptor.
---
There's a reason why they made the warclaw specifically for WvW.
---
Just in other places in this thread you were defending how it wasn’t a rant...
---
Lots of S1 AP were actually 'side stories' like the Karka stuff and Southsun, and festivals.
---
In any case, S1 needs to come back.
---
As someone who has contributed shaders to the reshade project, as well as writing some semi-popular shaders for gw2hook, I think I am well aware of what the relationship between reshade and gw2hook is.
---
(You're welcome)
---
I did. Removed everything for ARC and Dx912.pxy, reinstalled and was met by Gw2 immediately terminating after clicking.
---
Removed ARCdps and everything works normally. Which is weird, they're both up-to-date.
---
keep\_pairs should be 1
---
use\_pso\_precompile and use\_pso\_key\_cache should be 3
---
when you done making some good enough cache(by entering, running around at places of interest and exiting from game), set it to 1 2 1
---
hold shift and click, It should select all 4 (might have to be enabled in an option somewhere don't remember)
---
Sure sweetie.
---
I try to post on reddit when i have a stable enough version. But I do not own an army of testers, so better check for yourself if you have something to loose.

---
Consider me out of your idiocy loop. Got better things to do.
---
But custom build is still needed until pull request is accepted.
---
It's likely due to them utilizing the trading post. Always check if the items in your bag are worth more at the trading post than they are at the vendor. You'd be surprised how much money you can make that way, and you can sell from out in the field.
---
Also, the majority of them are likely making money off their level 80's. I can easily find one item that is worth more than 30s in the trading post off enemy loot alone. I absolutely suck at getting money, but even I can get 5g - 10g per session  just playing PvE content.
---
Thanks! That definitely helps out!

Single-threaded performance increases since the original i7/i5/i3 series have been relatively small. Idk too much about processor architecture but I'd imagine thats due in part to the fact that modern processors still are capped to around 4-5ghz stable due largely to heat increases. 
---
Multi threaded processing power has increased dramatically with 8core/16thread or 6/12 being baseline. However GW2 is based on GW1s original DX9 engine from the 2000s and back in those days the best you could buy was a quad core. The engine simply is not optimized for modern processors and probably modern GPUs as well.
---
If they were to spend considerable money and time to revamp their engine then 60fps-100+ would be an actual possibility. This addon helps significantly, however if Anet were to redo their engine it would probably have a dramatic impact on fps.
---
I doubt they will do that however, they will need to dedicate software engineers to the project and with the recent NCSoft cuts it seems more unlikely.
---
thanks I'll try that
---
everytime a necro joins */sarcasm*
---
Actually. It should see significant gains as long as you dont choke down your GPUs capabilities.
---
So, white knights are useful and actually explain things, while the opening post just expresses disappointment? Sounds good to me.
---
Now there is nothing wrong with with uttering disappointment, but simply saying "no" is easy. Looking at the consequences is harder and then coming up with a solution and suggestions that actually make sense?
---
Yes, the Skyscale is not what we would dream it to be, but if it were, its effects on so many maps and parts of the game would have to be reevaluated. It would mean a very high development effort; time I personally would want to see invested in other parts of the game, be they mechanics or new story content,or even only new armor pieces.
---
Survivor resets now. You just have to collect X amount of xp between deaths.
---
I miss it so so much. Why they changed it, I'll never know. I think it's Anets biggest mistake. Old LA had style, richness, personality and character. New LA is basically Tyria's Disney Land.
---
They ded.
---
Which wont happen because gw2 is Dual threaded... so... question still stands sadly.
---
Ah gotcha! I was hoping to have good news for him. Thanks for the great work on this!
---
Amazing how you went from 'contributor of shaders to the reshade project' and writer of 'semi-popular shaders' to someone who just likes to play around with someone else's implementation of very common effects. I think i got my point, take care!
---
For whatever reason as of late, the rate has gone from once or twice a month to nearly twice a week. I don't know what changed other than the recent elite spec updates. I don't think that's what's causing the sudden DPS interest.
---
The hidden gate in the last room reminds me that there is now a partially built Asura Gate in Skrittsburg's center (Brisban Wildlands), which has been receiving small changes/updates for years now (The area has been getting cleaned up and more tech is being turned on).
---
Your statement is wrong, gw2 uses more than 2 threads.
---
If I ever wanted to look at a bunch of cogs, I would visit the town of Nolan.
---
it also had a verticality that I think would be fun to explore with the new mounts. I also miss the crafting area next to the water
---
  
---
of all the changes though, I'm surprised they didn't try to rebuild the fountain at all
---
I looked into my bios settings and apparently there's a dynamic overclocking setting in there from the manufacturer that is turned off by default... I switched that on and it went up by about 10fps average. I wish I'd checked that out years ago as it's a 5 year old PC.
---
Thanks for your advice.
---
I agree with this. Season 2 is has a good story, but you get a lot more for your money with 3 and 4.
---
They should call it Red Dolyak XD
---
The only requirement is for those lines to have almost same name.
---
Until it not crashes and not have some permanent visual glitches it's all fine.
---
main threads ? or kinda the Supreme commander approach ( Ai , hit detection numbers movement everything core 1 ... core 2 textures ....)
---
and if so how many ?
---
Noone expects speedclear performance but certain classes like Weaver where top players can get 140k burst dps etc. or Soulbeast wich also pulls similar numbers are difficult for me to defend when certain players only get like 20k dps burst and diminish to under 8k overall dps.
---
Those people pull 1/7 of what their class is able to do, you don't need top performance for sure but at least get a third of that dps others can do, and do so constantly.
---
That in mind they occupy one dps slot and sometimes get outdamaged even by support Chronomancers etc.
---
Now if I call them out I'm the offender here?
---
I stand by my point that remarking on really bad dps is normal and should be encouraged, being casual does not include being a bad player.
---
A family father of three who can only play one hour a day and spends it in Fractals can still perform accordingly, being casual or simply having few time to sink into the game does not defend once capability to play.
---
Casuals are not bad players, I have raid mates who only log in once a week for the raid and then leave again - there is no issue with their potency.
---
Simply stating a playerbase is casual and indicating that casuals are bad, therefore we need to deal with it is pesky.
---
New players can't enter T4s so you don't even play with them since they lack AR, I have an issue with people that think they're entitled to join groups and bring their weird build (aka Dragonhunter Longbow or the good old Bearbow) and expect us to carry them.
---
If you fill up a group of hard-never-no-meta specs you have a hard time in any encounter.
---
New players in T4 usually read classguides and maybe look into mechanics too - since they'e new, also Casuals strive to build up their character as well - bad players who get offended by calling them out is what ticks most of us off.
---
Especially in real endgame content like CMs ^T4s and Raids.
---
yea thats what im gonna do.  Ive been logging it, getting the episode and then logging out.  when they announce the new expansion ill play through it all
---
I liked the old lions arch more than the new one we got. The old one did fit much better into the overall feel of the landscape with its "Pirate Bay" style of Shantytown look.
---
Wasn't around for the whole season 1 showdown, so I've got virtually no memory of old LA, but recently replayed the personal story's lvl 40 mission. Instead of going straight for destiny's edge I took the time to wander around the old plaza area like people here advised and oh my gosh, its gorgeous. 
---
At least Anet kept snippets of the old map in the personal story, so I'll get to piece the whole picture in my head as I go along.
---
Can SOE (now daybreak) count to three? Can Blizzard count to four? Can X count to Z? Can you make a point?
---
They go on sale often?
---
Anet Support is never wrong because they can basically do whatever they want, since all their licenses they give out to players are restricted, not full licenses.
---
The fact that Anet suspended OP is, in fact, a very strong suggestion that OP did something wrong.
---
Unless you can bring forward proof that Anet support is wrong in most cases.
---
Not really. Or you can just google guides for making easy gold. Auric Basin is one if you own HoT. Season 4 maps are also profitable if you own PoF.
---
So this is a hotfix to the 0.9.9 version I installed two days ago? I haven't had any issues with it since then. Should I still update?
---
Sorry I'm placing the goal of our team over your personal feelings.
---
I want it back for a nostalgia weekend so we can glide around it
---
Episodes are still not as big as expansion, map content is still rather poor compared to expansion maps. Story impact irrelevant cause it's matter of personal taste.
---
Aw. The memories I have of old LA makes me happy :)
---
they’re right! It is in Sandswept Isles!
---
Your priorites aren't the issue, the fact that you're a dick about it is.
---
Your entire first post was solely about story impact. And now you say it is irrelevant.
---
Okay.
---
What is there to marvel at?
---
Does it surprise you that GW2 is played by people?
---
If ArenaNet is so good, why is there no ArenaNet 2?
---
Half-life 3 confirmed bois
---
Fastest ways to make gold in game for people with no current gold would be doing HoT Metas (Auric Basin in particular) and Silverwastes. If you have the agony resistance definetely try doing T4 dailies. Other small things you can do daily are guild hall materials, home instance materials (if fairly full), ascended mats crafting, charging quartz crystal daily, converters and saving bags (not influenced by mf or unidentified gear) to open them on a level 49-53.
---
They have more competition now than in 2012. Making gw3 is opposite of rational now. Big expansion that would be good as starting point for newcomers on the other hand...
---
But we know living world is anet's favourite child even though it does nothing to introduce new people.
---
Well, okay, storywise you are correct. But this is a game, not a movie - gameplay is important.
---
Why lvl 49-53?
---
Also, I hear the strawberries are nice ;)
---
Here's a partial list from the perspective of how it affected map completion: [Area objectives added since launch](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Map_completion#Area_objectives_added_since_launch)
---
Well it was at it's peak with probably most devs on board.
---
Also it's damn thaumanova. Ugh.
---
Anet support is never wrong omegalul. 
---
I never said anet support is mostly wrong I said there are many cases where they are wrong. If you've browsed this shbreddit for even the past 6 months you could see many examples of wrongful bans during banwaves or other mixups. This sort of mistake isn't even limited to just the gw2 support team it happens in every game.
---
Decisions made by anet support are not always correct and you're just plain ignorant for thinking so.
---
Assuming you can't wait for a sale and you're talking about this [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account\_Jump\_Start](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account_Jump_Start) , then yes it is. The value of it is as follows....
---
x2 Bank slots = 1200 Gems
---
x2 Bag slots = 800 Gems
---
x10 BL chest keys = 900 Gems (Going off 5 key set for value as those are cheaper)
---
x15 Transmutation charges = 420 Gems
---
And a bunch of unidentified dyes.
---
Overall it's worth about 3320 Gems.
---
I know you said bank. But let's be honest, everyone will be wanting for bag slots.
---
FPS: 17
---
PepeLaugh
---
The one and only true Lions Arch you will be missed...
---
Guardian is lucky in that you can be viable in any game mode, either with or without the elite specs and the gear can be shared across them pretty well. 
---
Core guardian is still pretty strong, but both elite specs are strong choices too. Firebrand can go for support or condi dps/quickness dps, dragonhunter is a big damage spec. 
---
For WvW I *really* like firebrand support, you can be a great tanky zerg healer but still cope okay on your own. You bring a *lot* of utility with all the blocks and anti-projectile bubbles.  It genuinely feels rewarding.
---
To me, it feels larger, because we are not stuck on the ground anymore.  
---
And the new maps show exactly those possibilities how open the world and complex the world can be.
---
A lack of dps or hps is why groups can't clear Bosses, if your DDs can't keep up their damage or don't know mechanics you need to explain it to them and then replace them if they continue to fail.
---
There is no issue in that if you plan on actually clearing the encounter.
---
Don't be too humble just because you don't want to hurt their feelings - being a Dick I'd consider making snide remarks about some classes before Fights even start.
---
Necros in PvE get comments just for joining groups no matter their performance, that extremely annoys me!
---
The goal of the team is above everything else, in Fractals if you have Instabilities wich add Boons on Bosses I'm switching from Core Warrior to Spellbreaker for boonstrip; on Renegade I'm switching from Assassin or Dwarf Stance to Demon for boonstrip; on Support / dps Chronomancer I'll take Domination for Boonstrip on shatter.
---
I take no offence if someone tells me to switch, but often times others will if they're asked to adapt their build! Placing your own dps whatever over a clear advantage for the team is really selfish.
---
Having a correct build, running corresponding gearsets and not being a burden on your team is a community accepted standart.
---
If someone denys to play with the group and adapt, thats their problem.--
---
this really shouldn't. it might end up being disastrous if anet is forced to acknowledge d912pxy.
---
i'm sure anet is perfectly aware of d912pxy's existence, but if they want it to stay in the "unofficially allowed gray area", anet has to **publicly appear** to be not be aware of it.
---
if they acknowledge it in any way, anet must also make a judgement on whether d912pxy complies with the ToS, and must also periodically re-verify that it continues to comply with the ToS in the future.
---
as such, i recommend never asking anet about this mod. they either will never answer it, or be forced to potentially ban/restrict it in the future.
---
Semi on topic: I've got to do a fractal for my first legendary collection, do they eventually require higher tier fractals or can I do it all in lower level ones? (I've got bad joints so I'm not fast enough for harder content)
---
Wow nice looks, leagues better than any look I have seen on reddit.
---
On the shop season 2 and 3 are at 44% less. Usually how does the sale last?
---
I'm selling a mini ice raptor but there is always someone beating me by the copper.
---
This map had so much character, those old walkways, hidden areas, and verticality that would be so awesome with mounts now. New LA is flattened out disgrace.  Soaring on a griffon around that town would be so cool. Let's hope LA gets destroyed again.
---
But in relation to the total number of suspensions, only a very small percentage of them may be incorrect or will be adjusted after contacting support.
---
So if only 1% of suspensions get overturned, there is a 99% chance that OP broke the ToS.
---
Don't forget about [mordrem invasions](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/the-mordrem-are-coming/), there was many subtle and not so changes and additions, but nowhere i can find a complete list of those.
---
No, that's Old Old Lion's Arch.
---
Elaborate. It sounds like you're making an excuse for players to download the software and be a dick. Why don't you tell us what you mean?
---
anet was never really efficient in using their resources, just dump as forcing a new map every LS episode and just dump it after never using the assets again
---
Don't think so.
---
hmmm first time installing here and now I am crashing on start up. Getting this message at bottom of log : "36D942 \[ error \] helper | Error 2 in function StorageSystem::Registry::ATypeIOHandlerBase&lt;4,0&gt;::Read: RegGetValueW raised error 2: The system cannot find the file specified." 2080 ti with 9900k
---
I know that's a cheap response: But that's exactly the point, lorewise. You as an older player feel the same as the people inhabiting it.
---
It feels great! I'm not seeing big fps dips in WVW. Are you not recommending fullscreen over windowed fullscreen because of the bugs in previous patches? Fullscreen would be optimal.
---
Yeah, those were added as temporary open-world content, I was just listing off some of the changes that happened that stuck around after that and can still be seen in-game.
---
What is charging quarts daily and what are the converters?
---
A short summary:
---
Dgh: more utility, aoe
---
SB: insane burst damage, not much else
---
Holo: good sustained damage and aoe, infinite vulnerability uptime and best “team player” as far as boons and conditions are concerned.
---
Silver lining is the peace that comes from not having a jimmy-rigged "It was Scarlet!" subplot behind everything Abaddon did.
---
Sea World.
---
Old LA was my favorite city in all and any video game. It had character and it was like a character of itself. When I saw the destruction after Scarlet I burst into tears and was aimlessly wandering the ruins until I found some guard who told me the survivors are at the Vigil keep. I ran there as fast as I could and made sure they were okay...
---
Then I logged out and didn't return for 3 years.
---
When I saw the new LA I was revolted. Just... UGH. Why. It's ain't that kind of game. Why...
---
Eh, it's pretty indicative of the real world and how we tend to treat similar things. It's like a metaphor or something.
---
An old man walked up to me and said "Today is my 93rd birthday. My biggest regret? Getting old. It's fucking miserable. Don't make my mistake. Live fast, die Young, and leave a beautiful corpse." That was a weird day for Target.
---
How is it a slap in the face to GW1 players, GW1's Lions Arch was always underwater. The launch LA is not the same as GW1 LA.
---
&gt; a lack of InGame dps is a lack of human decency in the long run.
---
Your mindset is infuriating. Not everyone needs to approach the game with the desire to the best of the best of the best at it. Doing good(ish) numbers is fine for pugs, yes you want more and people can/should improve over time, but come on be real here when you first started doing raids and T4's +cms were you pulling the numbers that you now expect people to do? Did you consider yourself lacking human decency because you only making 80% of a dps benchmark?
---
&gt; this miniature does not exist.
---
&gt; they have also created a wiki page.
---
???
---
Greatsword has a lot of damage packed into #2 and comboing with 2&gt;5&gt;2 deals a lot to 5 close targets since #5 resets #2. #4 should be used for the block (multiple at range for 3 seconds or 1 close with a kick), or for it's second ranged ability. #3 (and your normal attacks) evade attacks so you can avoid a lot of damage that way. You really don't need any utility or passive skills to make greatsword good but it you're running something like "Sic 'Em" you can deal a lot of damage very fast. If you want any help with gear, builds, or even getting hero points let me know.
---
it exists - source: i have it, as do at least 3 other people i know  which caused me to farm it in the first place.
---
the mini is hidden in the wardrobe, as both the griffon mount, as well as the races through which you earn them are hidden bonus content of PoF. they were supposed to be surprises, and as such related hints got hidden in game. anet does similar things for e.g. some gemstore items, as well as legendary gliders/backpacks.
---
Sometimes things you haven't unlocked will not appear under the locked section of the hero panel. 
---
This one in particular does not appear because Anet did not want to ruin the surprise of the griffon mount as you never hear or see anything in the story about griffons until the very end. Now that it has been years, you don't really get that effect but that hidden flag on the mini still exists :)
---
Thank you very much!!!!!! Have a nice weekend!
---
Do the bits of this that Make Sense, ignore the bits that don't.
---
* Note down any regions in which you have all the masteries done, because events there will be effective. (Look for stuff where you do a bunch of events at once, ala Teq, or Silverwastes, or AB.)
---
*  Do dailies, especially WVW/PVP/dungeon ones as your chances of getting tomes on completion that can be turned into shards will be high. The exp scrolls can also be turned into tomes. And you have to do the WVW track for gift of battle, anyway!
---
* Buy Educational Suplies for you guess it, more tomes. The guild hall trader that changes daily has them, so you'll have to do guild missions/have spare commendations around.
---
* Do daily fractals if you're at t4--those boxes tend to drop tomes on the regular.
---
Sure not because 80% of a benchmark is really high.
---
Thats 4/5 of the possible dps and therefore really good - where you struggle is with guys that only deal 50% or less of their potential.
---
Its about bad dps, below 10k dps in Fractals or Raids etc. if you pull that close to a benchmark (usually 30k) in a real encounter you're pretty good!
---
And yes because I started as Dragonhunter it was rather easy to deal damage since Guardians burst consists of 4 buttons..
---
How can you see what Seasons you have access to?
---
 \----------------------------------------------------------------------- 
---
Updated May 5
---
Finally, my account is playable again.
---
Though the suspend duration I was told was 5 days, it actually took almost 7 days. It was a little sloppy and I was kind of disappointed in ArenaNet as a company. But anyway, I'm happy with being able to play the game again. I appreciate all the constructive advices, and for those who never had a problem like this, be very careful what to say in the game and who to play with. **Silence is gold.**
---
See you in the game!
---
&gt; Sure not because 80% of a benchmark is really high.
---
Really because talking with you so far Ive been getting the clear impression that anything but speed run numbers is bad, ie your first comment about BS and quickbrand doing 40-60k burst, plus that sweet 140k burst as a weaver.
---
This is reaper erasure
---
They actually discussed this in the stream, stating they made the wings twice they size they were originally because it wasn't believable. But it's a fucking dragon, and it's a video game, and it looks good and fun without taking up your entire screen
---
What game modes are you looking at?  I play just about every game mode except for raids and PvP (I do play WvW though)
---
I play a few classes but keep coming back to the rev.  It's probably not the "best" class for anything, although it does seem to be in a good spot for WvW.
---
Anyway, need a lot more detail in what you are wanting out of a class and what modes you are most interested in.
---
while the hero classes like Death Knights were interesting in how they made sure they intergrated into the story. I feel like gameplay-wise, it flows better when you can have all of the classes off the bat. And by the looks of it, they want a system that makes having more variety to your class (specializations) without having to jump through a bunch of hoops like you do for things like Legendaries. At most you have to run around, do some challenges, and then you get the spec.
---
It doesn't mean there's no in-lore reasoning for that being a thing, they just didn't want to let lore make a system feel more clunky/lengthy than it has to be. If you care that much about lore, you can just go with "my character learned how to do \_\_ by doing \_\_\_" and filling the blanks with something more lore-friendly while ignoring the way you earned it in game. It's really simple and doesn't mess up a system that's fine as is.
---
Why? If your going to do a sequal for an MMO you need a damn good reason for it otherwise it's better to keep updating and improving the original.
---
Yeah, I mean even the existing mounts (springer and griffon in particular) drastically mitigate some of the movement challenges in pre-POF maps.
---
Achievements don't have any gameplay impact.
---
As long as you are having fun all is good.
---
I will mention that there are collection under the achievements tab and these have been more enjoyable for me and they tend to have concrete rewards and feel more quest like so look at that.
---
There is a legendary backpack (one for fractals, one for wvw, and one for pvp) that have long collections that when I did the pvp one it felt like an epic quest!
---
If you want something you can dive off a cliff with and speed through a map, completely different.
---
Press h to open the hero panel, then click the star icon on the left side, then select a season/episode
---
Anti-Anet attitude? I don't really see it but even if it is there I think your attitude here is a faulty one. If I ran a software company and saw people making big or even small good mods for my software I'd sure as hell be curious as to whether they'd be talented and knowledgeable enough to take a job at my company. I'd even rather take someone with less talent and train them if it was clear they wanted to work for me over someone who saw it as just a job that they would leave once they find something they like better.
---
Take a look
---
A lot of events run on a 2 hour timer so yeah
---
Thank you for this work!
---
I'm using an old laptop 2.4GHz Intel 3630QM (Ivy bridge) and a GTX965M. I don't see any improvements in FPS (~15fps in blobs) but I had a lot of stuttering/jerkiness in WvW when around bigger groups and that has been reduced with the proxy.
---
By Ogden's Hammer, what savings!
---
Yeah only bad players complain about damage meters, has been from the start - even decades ago in WoW.
---
If your class can pull 100k dps burst you should at least do 66-75k ish for a reasonable margin. Pulling only two thirds of your classes damage is ok! No offense there.
---
If you sit at 30k dps where others go into triple your damage (read 200%-300% more than you) there is a problem with your performance.
---
This game has no vertical progression, you hit a ceiling rather quickly. Getting fullzerk ascended and you're done. Now you can pull benchmarks. Sure there is stuff like Fractal God etc. but thats within deviation and is only 7% to begin with.
---
Every player up in T4 and CMs is fully Ascended and can therefore reach speedrun dps. You just play windowed mode and follow your rotation of the guide webpage, there is nothing besides your lack of skill hindering you from dealing dps. Sure if your team can't CC bosses properly but since you can use consuables to stun enemys thats a non issue.
---
You don't need to pull speedrun high damage, you need however keep your damage coming. You have everything that you need for dps...
---
Excellent English.  Excellent analysis.
---
One of many stupid decisions.
---
I mean, I'm fine with destruction + rebuilding, but what made LA special was completely lost, only a few buildings in the faraway corners surviving at all.
---
when 25 quartz crystals in inventory you can charge them in orr temples (i'm doing in orr temples but there are other places too) you can find more info here https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quartz_Crystal
---
I prefer it this way. Changing things for the sake of just changing them was an awful idea. Lot of maps still have garbage from LW1
---
By the gods, right in the feels... 
---
They should srsly consider making us a "Old LA Pass" and it should be a separate map, like Mistlock Observatory. They don't even have to remake the whole city, just let us hang out by the fountain.
---
Don't think sculpting someones character would be illegal (or atleast acted upon).
---
If you however try to fling out a custom rytlock figure etc, you'll most likely be in trouble.
---
I'm not a rep or anything of Anet, just basing it on previous things I've seen.
---
God I hated old LA so much
---
Lovely little hidden spot.
---
Is it possible to get yur GF to gift the expansion to yur 6year old account or does it get rejected?
---
Well, they *wouldn't* have that garbage laying around if they continued to change and evolve. That was the whole point of a living world.
---
