Awesome! A good commander is a godsend. I remember one time in Dragon's Stand Meta, our group was wiping out at one of the pods and our current commander doesn't say anything and just kept going around killing the tenders. When we told him we need to reset, he got pissed and told us off. Finally he dropped the commander tag after telling us to do it our-self, another Commander took up the responsibility and do a reset, while explaining carefully what we should do. We got organized, did the pod event successfully, and took down Modremoth. That second Commander literally saved the map from failing, and we thank him profusely. He's also very chill about it too.

Haha! Basically, I do use WASD with action camera alongside a special mod called ICM. I can't go back. I used to play BDO and it definitely feels similar in terms of movement. 
---

---
When it comes to other keybindings, I use all the letters that are close to WASD and don't require weird finger positions..especially F1-4 keys which either twist my finger a bit or are too far in general. By using this set up I can move and use skills at the same times more easily and also since the distance is shorter..it takes less time to activate..milliseconds..but still faster.
---
Also, I don't strafe since it's not usually effective and I would usually also have S keybinded to a heal or something..since backpedalling is also usually not as effective..but w/e.
---
It's all preference at the end of the day.
---
And one more neat thing why I use ICM..I can remove the pesky textures that block the view for no reason. (a clear example is the skills background texture or mounts background texture). Literally what you see in the photo is what my screen looks like..if I press CTRL it shows the other things that are usually there by default.
---
they made it shorter (like scepter length) + purple-ish flames

Sounds like a good way to get ice-9.

ty dude, i always use your vids as a resource to find out what i want to spend my gold on
---
If I remember correctly: mostly light purple, dark purple, pink, respectively. But it depends on the dye - there are some blue dyes that shift green instead of purple. You'll want high contrast dyes to counter the purple/pink shift. You can get the shift to be lime green with dyes like Carnage Orange, for example.
---
All to them. That way, the people that want to hard content do it because they want to not because there is a carrot on a stick.
---
Lmao you're so full of shit, well good luck, I'm done with this.  Glad they wont be changing the chests anytime soon since none of it is legal gambling.  I guess you'll have to live with your hypocrisy of enjoying a little gambling but not a lot and of course "a lot" is something you make up and demand everyone else adhere too lol.  I hope they add in even more rng just to make you uncomfortable.
---
&gt;We've given the gaming industry over twenty years to show they can be responsible with lootboxes.
---
You've *given* them? So their freedom to create and sell a product is a gift that you can rescind?
---
If I think the drivel that pours out of your comments is bad for society, do I get to rescind your freedoms too?
---
&gt; You're just a voice naively arguing in favor of them being able to exploit us as hard as they want.
---
Your argument is that you are so incredibly irresponsible and lacking in impulse control and intelligence, that as soon as a company offers you the chance to gamble and waste your money, you have no choice but to do it.
---
Otherwise there is no world in which offering something optional for people to buy can be called "exploitation".
---
&gt; chaining the hands of a malicious wild beast 
---
Your dehumanization of video game studio employees in order to justify restricting their freedoms is a weak attempt at an appeal to emotion.
---
&gt;PS: Fuck right on out of here with that slippery-slope "regulating lootboxes is tantamount to literal slavery" strawman BS.
---
If only you could understand something called a principle.
---
"I don't like \[thing\] therefore I should be allowed to ban \[thing\]" is how you end up with no freedoms at all, because for everything you do in life is something that someone else wants to ban.
---
I would love to ban you from commenting stupid bullshit on the internet ever again. That would really improve society a lot! Your comments are wild beasts of misinformation and delusion that must be chained up so as not to harm our children! *Won't someone think of the children!?*

if you right click a salvage kit and then pick a tier type you will salvage all gear of that type in your bags, it will even salvage unidentified gear if its not in a shared or invisible bag. it doesn't happen as much since the mf nerf to unidentified gear but it still does upgrade you should identify before salvage.
---
On the contrary, because this game doesn’t have gear progression, I’d argue it is a better reason to have the same rewards. Games like FFXIV get away with something like 490 gear score for casual play and 500 (max for this example) for high level rewards but that is not possible in GW2
---
Idk but I hope it stays as long if not longer than WoW. It's so fun, I'd hate to be booted off
---
There was never a 4th lane in Dragon's Stand, it's a baseless rumor. There's three lanes, one for each previous zone, and one for each Mordrem Guard commander.
---
The southern half of the map is used for a story instance, and the northern half has no lane shape whatsoever, probably intended for another story instance or some bonus events.
---
I think the prospect of low quality design (such as which we've seen in Ahdashim) worries me more than seeing it locked behind a raid.

In my experience it doesn't matter all that much how many bag (or vault) slots you have- you'll find a way to fill them all eventually anyway.
---
But if everyone's speed running casual mode it ends up like dungeons before they nerfed the rewards, with meta builds to do it as fast as possible so newbies still have a barrier to entry when LFGing, plus players who want challenging content will have a far harder time PUGing when every other group is a casual speed clear for quick rewards.

Thank you for your contribution to the discussion

A buddy of mine saw an asura take his shirt off in the shower. And he said the asura had an 8-pack. That asura are shredded,
---
What's fun about this is there was already a 3.5 class that hit most of the same notes as Rev, Tome of Magic's "Binder". So it feels a little like it came full circle.
---
The level 80 boosts have pretty clear warnings that say you're about to go directly to endgame content or sth. If the player decides to ignore that and gets wrecked in HoT and PoF it's hardly anet's fault.
---
uhm.. okay.. now i got more questions:
---
1. what kind of fetish does your buddy have to take a shower with an asura?
---
2. what person/asura takes off the shirt IN the shower?!
---
Finally!!!
---
Albeit, now I have to remember this since it’s been long enough that I just adapted to it.
---
I thought that was fixed? Seems to me mine is account bound now.
---
Its more a less a rite of passage for a new legendary item to not count for that until its later fixed in a patch.
---
To be honest..I never did HOT metas until 2 weeks ago when I began my journey on Chuka and Champawat legendary weapon. I was at 99 Mastery points now I'm at 249 MP. Easiest thing to do is..to just throw yourself in. I was very pleasantly surprised.

Open world PvE is basically carried on its back by the sheer charisma of our commanders. Not that the maps are not good, but they *nearly demand* that someone take the heels of the collective adventures that are metas, the same way that burgers just need that cheese. Kudos to OP and everyone else who lead metas! I once got a message similar to that myself while leading a lane in Dragon's Stand. Whoever sent that, I don't think they realize just how much they made my day. So kudos to everyone who also acknowledges the effort :)
---
Some could I guess? But most of them are not applicable. Grenth's Domain for instance, the Mystic Forge (in lore you were personally invited by Zommoros to deal with the mess, you are not supposed to be there), W4 jail is kinda spoilery for the raid story itself and what could you possibly do there, W2 has nothing to show (a cave, a camp, maybe Matt's Castle but thats about it), same for W1. W7 sure would be nice tho, having some sort of short sequence ep to the raid's events when you go in and do stuff, but would that make sense? Going in without actually knowing what happened there?
---
You can play how you want in open world, dungeons, and t1 fractals. Maybe WvW, however there are some more restrictions. 
---
If you’re going into SPvP, higher level fractals, or raids, please try to conform to a meta build UNLESS you’re with a group that’s ok with your build and you are really good with said build.
---
If your rotation if efficent then you shouldn't have a problem using them as needed. I love Renewing Wave.
---
Haha yeah the kitless thing was a fun streak but any respectable Engi is gonna have to use a kit or two once in awhile. Maybe I’ll polish my skills and try to make a kitless holo build work

Not reliable at all given it bases mmo population on reddit subs, its a completely flawed methodology.

I got some bad news for you if you think the meta isn’t shifting. Support builds have shifted the most in the past 6 months, especially with scrapper coming into the scene.

I'm no expert on the politics involved, but my understanding is that Cantha is not going to happen so long as NCSoft owns Anet and the Chinese server remains operational.

Well actually aurene is now designed to contain dragon magic, so they can die
---
I see, thank you for telling me.
---
are they actually buyable? when i try to click one on the tp it just loads indefinitely
---
If you try to buy it then it just spins waiting forever until you close the TP window. The purchase doesn't go through.
---
No. ArenaNet patched the TP so you can't buy them.
---
WHY IS IT FLOATING AGAIN!?
---
Id like to point out that Aurene isnt the Crystal Dragon. Shes the Elder Dragon of Light.

I do not recognize any of those skills icons

When I use GW2taco I get a black screen.

All of this right here is what dungeons need and we're never getting it.

The gem store rotation usually goes Tuesdays to Mondays and then rotates in a new item and returning items but you're asking about the black lion chest rotation which has no schedule. The chest is usually only updated for seasonal events and large patches about 6-7 times per year. Expect the current chest to remain as is until four winds rolls around.

It's possible the Deep Sea Dragon is the most conniving villain until now. As an almost Abaddon-like figure, responsible for all the events until now.
---
It hides among the Pact, waiting for them to kill other Elder Dragons, and absorbing their magic.
---
Of course, Aurene becoming an Elder herself and the recycling magic probably goes against the Deep Sea Dragon's plan.  Which will prompt it to take action and attack Aurene.
---
Honestly, I think this is a perfect way to continue the story.
---
I meant top level as direct reply to the post. Low effort reply to low effort comment.
---
Well i been playing gw since gw1 was in beta and I like gambling and I think all rng is gambling as is mob drops and I hope they leave it the same.  If they change it they would be losing a hardcore veteran as I specifically play for the exact things you want to remove.
---
Which honestly a hilariously *bad* way to review player metrics. I'm willing to bet that about 1/3rd at most of the population uses reddit in GW2 concurrently (not counting the ones that browse anonymously or briefly skim over looking for guides) because I knew quite a lot of people who don't use the reddit (or in some extreme cases, didn't know we had one). If they wanted to they probably just sniff through the forums since people who post there have to actually have an account, unlike snooping through Reddit and seeing the currently active users as the currently active playerbase when a handful of those currently active could be refugees from other MMOs who keep up with social media sites like reddit taking a peek at what GW2's reddit community has to say about the game.
---
***A GAME THEORY!***
---
The implication presented at the end of lw4 is that Aurene can safely absorb the power of all elder dragons.  So we do have the option of making Aurene the most powerful being ever.  And, ye know, hoping that doesn't end badly or anything.
---
To put it in your words: as if 250 of each map currency is a lot!!!
---
On wiki is stated how to get each and every heart very fast. Even if you only wanted to use a single toon, even if you have only 1-2hrs of gameplay per day. Last epside was released on 14th May, 5 weeks ago, 35 days ago. You are looking at about 35-70hrs of gameplay since then. I'm not even mentioning that first episode released on 28th Nov 2017, more than 1,5ys ago. So you wanna say that you didn't have time to get just 1 stack of map currency in a wholo frikin year and a stack of Mistborn Motes in frikin 35 days? 
---
With that attitude you even dare to get on reddit and spit your 2 cents? I got my scascale in just a week and half with subpar gameplay time. It's definetly possible. Besides, you are not required to have skyscale. Just stay on your only raptor and catch bugs for the only heart you have.

Should have said “on reddit or in game”
---
Can’t say I agree with all the same rewards, I think you’re overestimating how little the majority of gw2 players care about fun or challenge compared to rewards. Make easy mode give no LI so you actually have to put some effort in to get legy armor, but use easy mode a way to ease players into the idea of instanced content where your team really depends on you.
---
Well you saying your enjoyment is ruined due to black lion chests is silly.  I mean why pick up the game in the first place.  They were already there at the start.  Obviously you're fine tolerating them, you would think you wouldn't be so selfish to demand they are removed despite people saying they enjoy them? Why not just leave people alone, they were here enjoying the rng based game before you decided to compromise and play the game anyways, even though it was already there in the first place.
---
That already exists with CMs, so you’re just suggesting that we make all of raids become easier, which is a little silly considering they’re already really easy compared to other games and the vets in this game are starved for difficult content as is.
---
I’d love to see this subreddit, but apparently I don’t know how to turn off the nsfw protection. New user much?

---
It's less silly than you saying that your enjoyment is ruined by their removal, since the pure skinnerbox thrill you might get from them could be replaced by anything else out there. What's stopping you from playing GW2 for whatever non-BLC aspects of the game you enjoy, and then just gambling in other products for the gambler's thrill? 
---
&gt; I mean why pick up the game in the first place. They were already there at the start. 
---
Like I told you, I like the *other* aspects of the game enough that I *put up with* the existence of the BLCs, and plan to continue doing so, but *removing them* would cause me to enjoy the game *more.* As you said, you don't like raiding, and perhaps it doesn't bother you in the least that they exist, but can you honestly say that you would not enjoy the game even *slightly* more if the rewards and environments that are currently locked behind the raids were instead available to be earned without having to raid for them? I am asking **honestly,** not just "whatever position would suit the argument I am making." your answer to this question will allow me to gauge your general level of honesty. 
---
&gt;Why not just leave people alone, they were here enjoying the rng based game before you decided to compromise and play the game anyways, even though it was already there in the first place.
---
I've been playing this game since the first betas, and I'm perfectly willing to "leave these players alone," I'm not going after them, I'm going after the gambling mechanics. What they do if those mechanics are removed is their own business.

I noticed that you didn't answer my question, so I'll pose it again: As you said, you don't like raiding, and perhaps it doesn't bother you in the least that they exist, but can you honestly say that you would not enjoy the game even slightly more if the rewards and environments that are currently locked behind the raids were instead available to be earned without having to raid for them? I am asking honestly, not just "whatever position would suit the argument I am making." Your answer to this question will allow me to gauge your general level of honesty. Failure to ask it a second time will say volumes about your seriousness in this conversation.
---
&gt;Yah well I take great offense by people who seek to protect others from themselves. 
---
Ok. I take even more offense from people who are uninterested in protected people from themselves, especially when it's been well established that people often do not act in their own best interests. 
---
&gt;The real argument is how this stuff applies to other games like gatcha games. People use the same predatory argument you use in gw2 to those games and if the shut those down tons of people would lose their entire accounts, in order for them to be protected from themseleves.
---
Maybe. I think it's more likely that they would just shift their business models to adapt to a changing marketplace. They would continue development on those games, but just release content under a different business model, such as allowing you to buy characters directly, perhaps focusing on selling cosmetics for those characters rather than the characters themselves. Things like that. They might make less money that way, after all, capitalizing on human weakness is one of the most effective ways to make money, but that doesn't mean it's the *only* way to make money, and if their only do options were to "be better" or "quit entirely," they would make more money from being better than they would from quitting. 
---
Besides, all these games will shut down eventually and all the money invested in those accounts will be just as discarded then as if they shut down due to anti-gambling regulations.
---
&gt;In terms of gw2 I view all of these arguments against gambling the same as though people are trying to shut down the game because mmos are addictive. What's to stop concerned citizens from saying that people need protection from themselves in this regard.
---
I don't think those arguments have much steam behind them. If anyone chooses to make those arguments, then we can oppose them together. Any argument can be made at any time, for any reason. Those people don't need anti-gambling regulation to succeed for them to be able to make that push if they choose, nor would the success of anti-gambling regulation mean that their efforts should be ignored. If A is a good idea, then "because B might happen" is no excuse not to do A. If B is a bad idea, fight B. 
---
&gt;So for me I dont like this slippery slope or the end game result of any of it.
---
I've noticed this intriguing phenomenon in which people who raise slippery slope arguments very often do not want to move *even an inch* down that slope, rather than being so concerned about finding themselves at the bottom of it. It's pretty much always "I hate moving even an inch down that slope, and you might not feel that way, but what about the bottom of it where anti-gambling regulation leads to World War III and people fighting for gasoline in the radioactive deserts?" You very rarely encounter people that can credibly say "I would be totally fine with going *halfway* down that slope, I'm *just* worried about after that. . ."
---
Necro pvp spec? Yep gonna be fun and not OP. Mesmer with aoe damage? Fits. Ele with rifle? Pleaseeee nooo but ranged single target does fit. Personally I want double pistols for ele. Mid ranged scattered dps. Thief mage? In all fairness since weaver is kinda like a thief it is fair to give thief the same treatment, make it more magical but personally I want thief to become more like a “detective”. A hybrid class that puts on conditions on enemies (unique maybe) then uses ‘punish’ skills that consumes the condies on enemies and converts them to single (or many packets idk) but power based hit. Engineer needs a solid support role.
---
&gt;	more prosthetic options
---
That word, I don’t think it means what you think it means. (Are you looking for *aesthetic*?)
---
In all seriousness, I do wish we had a bit more variety for fashion. Sometimes the look I want is hard to go with the theme I want (trying to make my Engineer look like Iron Man when all I have are leather trench coats is really hard). 
---
Luckily, a lot of skins (like a lot of LS3 achievement ones) are the same on all three weights which gives us variety, but you can’t always find what you’re looking for in every weight. I get why they do that though, it makes it a lot easier to recognize an armor weight based off appearance alone.
---
North would be cool too! I love the Dredge - going North could give them and the Norn some more story and maybe a new goal. Honestly, the way they have been doing living stories, I'd like to see both Cantha and a northern map in the same story stretch. Somehow find a way to tie organizations and events together -- whatever the next threat is will probably have to feel larger than the last. I think either we will get more "siphoning power from the endless mists" content or maybe Tyria itself will be in peril.   
---
Imagine going South and finding out about the sea dragon, only to have it snake its way up to the North in the deepest, coldest waters, threatening to sink Tyria entirely. Or maybe like in the concept art, the Dragon's body is more water than flesh and can be seen/approached from different oceans around the continent.  
---
I'm not sure what the new team has planned but I'd love for them to "Lion's Arch" a few classic maps and change them a bit due to the current/future story. I know that is a tough request though because then they'd have to make lvl 1-80 instances on a different classic map compared to the new ones. Maybe due to how the story was designed, we can only ever expand outwards, not in?
---
That's not a bug. It happens when they absorb an orb.
---
A quick google search says yes indeed I do ;D thanks
---
Double pistol Elementalist sounds pretty sick, honestly! I think it could go either way but I love that fancy "Victorian era rifle woman" aesthetic. Skating across the floor with magic and delivering graceful shots sounds like a nice contrast to the more "gunpowder and grease" Engi/Thief guns. Pistol Ele could do that too though - I'd love to see it!   
---
The detective idea sounds nice too - I like classes that have to micro-manage a bit so Thieves setting up their targets for that big hit down the line sounds like a nice approach. I'd just love to see how different a Scepter could feel in the hands of a Thief - like some celestial trickster or something!
---
 don't worry. iv'been around the game almost from the begining ...and havn't done Raids yet  nor achieved any WvW content XD
---
have fun rlax and let things go. we carry way too much usless thing with us.
---
Ok so kourna i just do the village heart and meta if its up, super easy to complete and most time efficient for shards.
---
Jahai, just park characters at the pact camp and throw shards at training dummies. Also most time efficient. If the map is low populated and u have some spare time, you can consider doing rifts, if not many ppl are there (less than 5 preferred) to scale things up its super time efficient as well :)
---
Thunderhead is a lil tricky, for me i just did the heart for zephyrites and doing the meta if its up. I find that quite time efficient too. Hope this helps!

While I see what you're saying I disagree with quite a few of the things that you're saying. (I did play GW1 and think GW2 still has a few archetypal builds to turn into elite specs for good measure.
---
**Rifle Ranger** would be so weird; I don't think it could work. which niche would rifle fill? Longbow already gives them all the ranged single-target DPS they'd ever want; with stealth &amp; AoE cripple for good measure. if you go blunderbuss w/ 600-900 range instead, that's similar to shortbow, and kind of the opposite of being a hunter.
---
Instead I'd like to suggest a **pistol** instead; it could get a crossbow skin as part of it's unlock collection (and all thieves rejoice); the skills would be centered around snaring your foes (think net shot; crippling shot, Throw Bolas etc.) for a burst-heavy set of pets that benefit from your enemy being unable to move out of range of their attacks. 
---
 I do like the idea of "Elite Pets"; where this beast-master elite spec loses access to their pet-swap to forge a stronger bond with the one pet they have active. gaining instead a pet-specific skill on the F4. This pet would need to have a ++ to their health (since they can't be pet-swap to prevent from getting downed) and their F2s could be leaps / bounds or Teleports (Skelk can teleport!); so they can AoE pounce on the targeted enemy. This makes sense to me in relation to GW1 as well; because they had different evolutions of your pets: [Pet Evolution](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Animal_companion#Evolution) Dire (++DMG --Health) Elder (base DMG base Health) and Hearty (++Health --DMG)

**Warrior** should clearly be called Corsair; and get access to Tricks to compliment their physical kicks n punches; if you're theming these after Cantha; they had an entire faction that _used to_ roam an inland sea; the Luxons would be quite perfect for the theme.
---
**Mesmer**'s already got ambushes in Mirage; I think a Bard specialization should be a dedicated healer; if you went with a Shortbow instead of a longbow it would give Mesmers the ability to finally use [The Dreamer](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Dreamer)! which is clearly perfect for Mesmers. imagine the CHOIR of phantasms you could summon to heal your allies HAHAHAHAHA. their utility should probably be glyphs or concecrations or something which get improved effects based on how many clones/phantasms you have alive.
---
I don't have more data to add tonight :) but yeah I've got thoughts about elite specializations.
---
I've been working on adding all the skills/effects to the wiki and I've actually got a stub article up for it: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Seismic_Suffering. Basically, it's just an aura that ticks damage over time like any other you might find in most other raid encounters. However, it shouldn't be ticking for 3–5k each time. If it is, then you've been hit a bunch by Hand of Erosion's Eroding Curse attack, which gives you a temporary debuff that increases incoming damage. This effect stacks in intensity for each time you get hit by Eroding Curse. I have the specifics and the effect somewhere in my notes, but I don't have those on me at the moment.
---
I concur, metabattle builds are a solid base from which you can then make changes to suit yourself. They are developed by active WvW players in leading guilds.
---
Scrapper meta build is on metabattle as a meta build.
---
chinese servers are a lot different than NA/EU servers. don't take anything coming from there as something that'll happen to EU/NA
---
Its quite unclear to me because when i clicked around my teammates they didnt have any debuff from the hands, even though the Erosion hands were spawned &lt;25%.
---
I think it's only for Rev's base weapons. The short bow is the pre for the Renegade's short bow, I think. I'd wager that they plan on releasing the rest of the set slowly with each Elite Specc.
---
Are you certain that Seismic Suffering is hitting you for that much? If so, how did you determine this?
---
They are not making money at them oment. it's a conservative phase. Let's hope it's a form of focusing on more content and moreover, by the info provided  on april.

&gt;The Future  
---
&gt;The commander’s tale will continue in Living World Season 5. As the teams get going and plans become more cemented, we’ll be able to talk a bit more on that topic.  
---
&gt;We also have our sights set on a few features that have already been in development for some time. **Please understand that these are all works in progress, so details can change between here and the final version, and we don’t have a timeline for the release of any of these.** These features will ship when they are ready.  
---
&gt;The rune and sigil salvaging release last year was in anticipation of releasing legendary runes and sigils—the final components of legendary core equipment.  
---
&gt;Over the past few months, astute players have been noticing a trend of updates and improvements to how our skill-slotting system works and have accurately speculated that the long-requested feature of build templates is in the works.  
---
&gt;We’d like to increase the max cooking level from 400 to 500. This crafting profession needs a refresh to make lower-tier foods important to the ecosystem and help reinvigorate various resources throughout the game.  
---
&gt;We’ve mentioned in the past how important world restructuring is to our WvW initiatives, and that hasn’t changed. While the Programming Team is focused on this initiative, the team is also focusing on smaller updates that can temporarily change the game mode, like the No Downed State Week we’ve done in the past. We’re also talking about different types of reward structures for events.  
---
&gt;Swiss tournament support is the next major feature the sPvP team is working on. This feature will be utilized by our structured tournaments moving forward.  
---
&gt;Further Down the Road  
---
&gt;Beyond all of this, here is some of what’s on our radar for the future. **None of these have been fully designed and are even more subject to change—or being shelved:**  
---
&gt;For WvW, we’ve talked about changing the matches so that scoring matters in 8-hour intervals. This allows us to address gameplay in off-peak hours in a way that doesn’t invalidate the work of the most active populations.  
---
&gt;After the cooking 500 update, jewel crafting is the last profession needing to be extended.  
---
&gt;The Competitive Team has been working on the idea of building a festival that highlights both sPvP and WvW. It’s a fun concept that would allow us to focus on those game types and try new things.  
---
&gt;This sort of discussion of projects that we’ve kept under wraps until now is a departure from how we’ve been communicating for a while. It’s our hope that through posts like this we can help clarify for you what our priorities and goals are for the game. And while this isn’t everything we have planned for the game, it at least gives you better insight into its development. The team is passionate about not only supporting *Guild Wars 2*, but continuing to grow it alongside all of you.  
---
&gt;Thanks for your time and see you in game!"
---
so with no Expac content to reveal and small changes on optimisation of the actual game as it is, all we have is Living Wolrd 4 and Living Wold 5 continuing before any big revel or work in the near future. Remember Anet and GW2 had  really bad Q4 2018 in reveneus and playuer critical mass. A breaking point in time for Anet and GW2 if you ask me. We are probably living the most fragile moments of decadence/rebirth for GW2.  
---
Lets hope for the later.

'Multiple exclamation marks,' he went on, shaking his head, 'are a sure sign of a diseased mind.' -- in Eric (Terry Pratchett )
---
I wouldn't say that they are in a bad spot but they are not as forgiving as a Necro, Mesmer or a Ranger. 
---
With a Necro you can pretty much rely on your Reaper or death shroud to gobble up the damage your receive or shield yourself with the Barrier from the Scourge. With Mesmer you have so many evades and interrupts and other things that you might not get damaged in combat at all and with rangers, Longbow and pet and you are pretty much a long range sniper with a lot of damage.
---
but with thief, you have to be on your toes and if you get hit you will take the damage.

Remember electricity?

We know he is active, but I don't think he is really awake. Like Primordus in GW1. The destroyers already flooded the depth without him roaming around as well. I like to think, that we would have seen more of his influence if bubbles is really up and going. But then again, Jormag was as well und we never seen anything of him.
---
If you have Season 3 or 4 zones, Karmic retribuation and zone dalies are a good way to get karma as well.
---
Very relevant username to the discussion too, thanks for pitching in.
---
Is the magic-warped packet better than the magic-warped bundle? How much profit can i make with it?
---
The point of the easy mode is that any random party can work their way to a clear, effectively removing the barrier to entry because anyone can LFG without worry of being dps shamed. Lastly, this is a game after all, I am preaching to those that play for enjoyment rather than reward. Playing for reward is a whole different rabbit hole I do not want to go down. The reward is the experience and that is lost in modern games. (Think the tower in shadow of the colossus; no achievement, no reward other than the view and a negative stat adjustment if you choose, just pure enjoyment, and it is actually pretty difficult to do/takes a while)
---
I just got interest back in the game after not having played since HoT was relatively fresh and that’s one thing I distinctly remember. It was anxiety inducing but obscenely rewarding
---
Yes, yes. You are the expert. And naturally you can judge perfectly that everyone at ANet is an idiot. Obviously. I mean, your expertise comes from playing games after all.
---
It definitly does. Just doing the metas with all the mobs is goving so much karma. Just make sure to use a lot of aoe skills.
---
Not for the moment: but don't miss the Wintersday festival this year to stock up on karma.
---
I can log in and out but I can't join any PVP match. So maybe yes?
---
Sorry new to reddit. I should see the rule first thx for reminding.
---
My biggest issue was trying to pop a Feedback during the hand phase because when the Feedback appears up in the air it is completely useless against the hand that bumps you for the obvious reason of not being in the way.
---
Especially don't forget the buff from the guild hall since it's free.
---
Peen v Peen
---
think of the skyscale as a semi-legendary mount that no one needs but everyone wants, and only the dedicated deserves. frankly i enjoyed the farm/grind, except for feed, where i spent 1 minute feeding the baby, then having to wait 23 hours and 58 minutes before i can spend another minute feeding it.... twice!
---
early birds had to wait a day for every step.
---
and frankly this is the game, there seems to be many points about this game you dont like. if you cant focus on the positive aspects while hoping the negative aspects get fixed, maybe you should try some browser/mobile game.
---
you were downvoted because people don't agree with you. thays kinda how reddit works bro
---
Daily fractals is a huge passive karma income.
---
get on this anet
---
Yes we need to fight the mad king not that instance where we fight the mad king.
---
Idk I have a fulltime job, a life and everything too but it kinda only took me 4 days to finish it (I had around 50 on every currency).
---
Again, if you would like to contribute positively please do so - I'm all ears, but there is plenty enough negative talk on the net already. Please at least try and be constructive with your criticism.
---
I'll focus on the major two points - utilities and mounts.
---
The mounts aren't exactly as we use them now; I even wrote about them having some normal (fast speed) for the equivalent of swiftness but nothing obnoxious and for those similar abilities - they'll be limited by a long cool down. Both of which I do believe I made sure it was known.
---
As for the utilities, we haven't had anything build upon utilities of the same type yet. Yes it may seem lazy. But rather than taking a skill set from another class or create a new one (beserker/holosmith) invest into a skillset and make it defining - particularly something Taimi did as she tweaked and changed Scrappy over the years.
---
There is an intention behind it along with a willingness to get the most out of the concept in stone with a mindset to be open to be put through an expect furnace of criticism of some way or another - I enjoy the writing of concepts; guild wars E-Specs are a good read and I make sure I do so when I see them on here or the forums. But unless I get some good feedback on refining the idea to actually make it usable, how can I grow it, refine it and better it?
---
Again, I'm not great with the lore but I'm willing to tweak and change where needed to get the most out of this bones construct of an idea. If you're willing to help me do so, please do :)
---
The bundle does not drop the ascended mats he is looking for.  It does drop Mystic Clovers though!  I can't speak as to the profitability of each though.  There are some old posts comparing them available in this subreddit, but since mat prices have changed so much since then, the are no longer relevant.   
---
On the wiki you can click on each one of them and see what it drops and what the drop rate appears to be.
---
Yeah I pretty much feel the same way. They need to create something very different to the current ones if they want to excite me
---
Absolutely agree. Fine to use as a starting point, but don’t stay on those builds. It’s even fine to use them as a reference for your own theorycrafting, but it’s not good to stick with them
---
Hey I’m in Asia too and I wanna try raid as well! Can you guys take me in xD
---
Especially if you're a player who has played other MMOs before. I would definitely recommend boosting to anyone who is willing to watch a few class guides or read their traits.
---
Because they are invisible 🙄
---
Burn the heretics.
---
&gt; using your wording; a modified kit perhaps?
---
no, i mean weapon mods being a new skill type. introduce something that works well with the kits but doesn't require them.
---
also drop the mount aspect, there's no reason for it to be there other then "mounts fun" (and no that's not a good reason to include them) and i know you want mechs but the way you've implemented them is just bad mechanically speaking and i just don't know how you'd make that work in the different game modes without it turning into an unbalanced mess
---
Either he's a racist or surprised!
---
People are too scared to even try normal raids and they label it as "elitist" when people suggest they should try them (had a guild break up exactly because they wanted to prepare people for raids and t4 fractals but some officers yelled at the leader and called him an elitist) so for those idk 10% of players who aren't dumb like that and actually enjoy every part of the game , it could be a fun idea .
---
LMAO what ARE those suppose to be?
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
i don't go to parties
---
Oh yh your right, this was suppose to be the ingame design. Evangelical fukken ekans
---
I think they're the forgotten priests
---
My advice to you is not to bother starting the legendary trinket...just putting that out there.
---
Yesterday this was reposted as "Me fighting the elemental from human personal story".
---
&gt; someone was triggered enough to be an ass and yell at you
---
Last night at Sandswept Isles, Im running around dong hearts and whatever i can to fill out missing achives. There were bunch of tags there each doing their own thing. And this pink necro at specimen chamber kept yelling on the other bunch of people over the whole map, not to kill Zohaqan. Proceeded to flame them afterwards, inc. irl life threats.
---
Because this is just ad space, not something reserved for GW2. There are some things that influence what ads you get shown: browsing habit, history, topic. It only makes sense that ESO gets shown in a MMORPG subreddit. It's the same target audience and even the same genre / subgenre.
---
Bethesda booked some channels in the advertising network, that's how advertising works.
---
I think the debuff is personal. you can see yours but not others. it's stacks that comes from the blue aura hand.
---
i know at this point your mounts aren't mounts but just based on mounts and i'm saying you that you might as well drop the mount thing entirely. be creative come up with your own mech designs/ideas but still the way you've put these mechs into mechanics won't work, the toolbelt (at least the way you've suggested it) is not the way to implement mechs
---
Gw2 got so many accessibility setting, but not this one. It's hard to understand why.
---
Considering that it's craftable you'll be able to get it during next halloween.
---
i mean except the "boss" fractals that have agony checks you can pretty much dodge most of the agony attacks anyway
---
and even in those, others can rezbot you as those attacks only occur at the start of the fight
---
Oooh
---
Interesting thinking :)
---
I'll put some thought towards it 
---
Thank you friend :)
---
Do dragonfall and buy the karmic retribution buff from the voltile magic vendor.
---
&gt; On raids I think Thief is a good entry class.
---
Thief is a good class overall for raids and it can be used efficiently in most fights, not only in progression raiding. It has a semi-decent burst (as DD) and one of the highest dps in the game currently, which makes it just as good as many other classes even in phase-based fights. The only reason not to pick a thief over any other class (when class selection isn't a problem for the entire squad) is speedrunning some fights or condi requirement. The point about fractals is spot on tho, Thief can be used to some degree, but it's not nearly as good as, let's say, power Soulbeast due to shorter fights.
---
Scourge is an entirely different class and role, you don't pick it when you simply need a high dps. You certainly don't fill your squads with Scourges only, it's just redundant.
---
Blue really depends on the actual dye used - you can get anywhere from green (such as if you use regal, for example) to purple (with, say, Zaffre) to pink/teal (generally lighter blues like Sky for that)
---
Black doesn't work especially great - it looks very good but more-or-less cancels out the iridescent effect as far as I can tell. I used abyss and shadowabyss, both looked pretty shiny but no noticable colour changes with lighting.
---
White doesn't work great - there isn't much colour change (maybe some pink) but it's not great on the eyes - I tried celestial so maybe some less saturated whites could work, but yeah, not fun if you wanna keep your eyesight.
---
I currently use a combination of black, grey, a little deep purple (using shadow-violet) and golden trim with the final slot. I think it's a great combination between making the dragon still beautiful but pretty badass as well imo.
---
what a ridiculous question
---
obviously the people that either can't do the achievements or would rather just pay up than even attempt them? kinda obvious
---
Possibly another. But its easier to see and tell them to stop than say Crimson where you place one barrel and set off the despawn timer, rather than having to do an action 15 times.
---
note that i was just spit-balling and that this idea probably has it's own issues
---
Aye 
---
But fun none the less :)
---
Just a matter of squaring the circle to have it work somehow
---
O dang I didn't knew that! Thank you for pointing it out because I thought it'd be like in PoF
---
EVANGELICAL EKANS
---
i used to get 10g-100g per hero points run when pof comeout.  
---
without asking at all.. ppl just are thankfull for the experience.  
---
In the same way i gift the commanders when they do a good job in a map i dont know.  
---
Is just being nice.
---
\*Steamy\*
---
mirage is better in the things you listed because of its burstier dps and has access to evades, superspeed, stealth, better mobility etc.
---
do keep in mind that in fractals power builds are better(scourge is probably the worst build you could bring in fotms)
---
Am I the only one that want to go to a whole new region that we’ve never been to in GW1 in this next expansion?
---
In their current state thiefs are just laughable in every gamemode. Back then you actaully had to be scared of a good thief and nowdays all they can do is poking and running. They are nothing more than annoying mosquitos.
---
I’m biased towards asura eles, but they have some neat animations, especially the water overload. I haven’t played revenant much, but the hammer animation seems a bit awkward to me for asura. Also, you lose out on the standard asura dodge if you go with revenant. 
---
That said, you could always make both an asura ele and an asura revenant and see which you like more.
---
Down
---
Voted
---
Some animations might not change, but others change a lot, compare ele fire staff 5 between asura, charr, humanoid male and humanoid female for example.
---
Then we'd need a lot of skills to come with reveal because this is the only way some classes can keep track of stealthed players.
---
could you give an example? as far as i'm aware it does break target, however you obviously still have to move out of the way.
---
when a skill is activated before the enemy goes into stealth it still finds the enemy and hits, like you can hit a full longbow 2 on ranger even if the enemy is stealthing right after you cast it
---
Hammerdins in GW2? Sign me up.
---
Move theif, get out the way

Get out the way theif, get out the way

---
First character, and always my main one. Thief is a style of play.  
---
Like every MMO : Yes, there is a "META". But if you know how to play your character, you fuck this meta. (Unless there is someone who know how to perfectly play its character and it's a meta one ofc)
---
That's what cool about it to me. Remind me of a 1 hander staff. Imagine that with sword mainhand. Would have been cool.
---
Rytlette. God help us all.
---
Golems can't bleed blood, but they could bleed oil or something like that.
---
All ghosts and spirits should be immune to psychical attacks (just like red guardian in VG, but is has very high toughness), or at least have a high chande to evade an attack.
---
I'll be glad to sell you a couple million of those if ArenaNet ever allowed it. Will gladly throw in Spirit Shards to sweeten the deal.
---
:D i wouldnt mind buying some, im at a point that i have to stop and farm karma to be able to buy stuff for the aurora collection :(
---
[Same here](https://i.imgur.com/pUPZuVt.png)
---
I've played a bit of Warrior and Soulbeast, 80s of every class, but I always come back to thief and my second highest amount of hours is 316 on my warrior.
---
I typically go Daredevil because the rediculous sustain, since nothing can usually bring me down if I'm playing right (in PvE, at least, I don't really do much WvW outside of zergs and haven't touched PvP in ages).
---
Haven't touched raids yet but I plan to do so soon, been putting it off to raid in other games (Wildstar (rip), FFXIV).
---
I see the occasional thief here and there, but if they're playing Daredevil they aren't the flashiest of classes, so you don't notice them sometimes in a group event/meta.
---
You know I actually agree with you it's shitty to use "trap" in that way, but that's not what you argued, and going immediately to "lol u all triggered" is not doing you any favours.
---
I never even considered this until I ported a few people to end of a JP just to be kind. Two of them sent me unsolicited tips. Decided to wait it out a bit longer to see how much I could get. It was an off hour so I didn't make as much as I would have gotten via farming, but it was enough to keep me in place while alt-tabbing between reddit and GW2 for an hour or two. Now, I always tip people for providing portals that save me time.
---
Not 1 of the above is actually correct.
---
1. You can almost infinitely tank bosses due to high self sustain, DD dodges improve dps and helps sustain - Face tanked 3 Champs in Bitter-frost just this weekend
---
2. With the right traits and skills you bring plenty of CC and vulnerability - not the most but not the least either
---
3. Have you played daredevil?? AOE damage is insane on staff
---
What shortbow skin is that?
---
I think just his magic was absorbed, not his spirit pr whatever he has
---
I can totally confirm that one. With karmic retribution maxed, and the multiple waves of enemies in there, it won't take long to amass a lot of karma. Plus, the event happens fairly frequently, and on a set schedule.
---
Just use another weapon that isn’t a shield, then?
---
Not great, not terrible either.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Weapon#Weapon_usability_by_professions
---
I literally had some guy who tagged himself as a commander tell me he was too good to res people.  That it was below a commander and blah blah blah.  Dicks are everywhere unfortunately.
---
either from a drop, buy from TP or buy from a vendor.
---
you are able to use all of the weapons a class has access to straight away, you just need to go get one.
---
I like to shout "Here comes Easy Mode!" when I join a bounty in progress.
---
IM MAD THAT GAME DOESNT HAND ME LOOT WITHOUT EFFORT. Also add some line about how they were so helpful in another game - without proof........
---
Mesmer has offhand sword
---
1 You may be able to do that in open world but it won't work in fractals or raids.
---
2: Everyone brings CC and many classes can near cap or fully cap vulnerability already.
---
3: DD aoe is decent but still quite a bit lower then guard, necro &amp; ele.
---
Where do you go to see that information? Is it ingame somehow? I know of /age but that one looks different.
---
* Thieves
---
And there are a lot of us out there. Daredevil (an elite spec of Thief) is one of the best DPS in PvE out there - assuming you play it properly. Furthermore a lot of people play Thief for Roaming in WvW or decapping and outnumbering in PvP.
---
Doing that on CM99 is a good, albeit exhausting feeling.  So many people forcefully cap Vainst the pattern and tide of agony orbs.  You're so much better off just waiting out the patterns and synching up with the patterns of blue healing orbs if you need to cap more than one circle.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chuka_and_Champawat  
---
Looks like that or maybe the precursor
---
Not really, no.
---
Well u really wouldnt need to know the story. Its a city of Djinn.  a lot of other things could be going on in there afterwards without touching directly to the raid story, kind of like theres minor conversations in Jahaii bluffs about the mystic forge escapees but not much else on what is going on.
---
But yes only if the story makes sense to go there.
---
I would but I didn't want to buy a ds because of one game.
---
Good question, but I wish his ghost is now in the mists battling against king thorn and coming back at Halloween.
---
Aha thanks for the thorough breakdown ! 😄
---
 By definition PvE BUT I agree its a subgroup of PvE. ANd yes it should be rated only by people who enjoy that type of content. Kind of like movies. If you are a horror enthusiast only u can say how good or bad a horror movie is, a person who watches rom coms only  wouldnt know , ya know?
---
I bet Kralk was eating mist-ghosts as well. Probably experienced true death.
---
On [https://gw2efficiency.com/](https://gw2efficiency.com/), you'll need an API Key to link it to your gw2 account.  
---
You can create one here :  [https://account.arena.net/applications](https://account.arena.net/applications)   
---
By the way, GW2 Efficiency is a great website for a lot of things : Dailies routine, enriched nodes, find an object you have lost on one of your 15 characters etc...
---
lots assuming you have a raptor.
---
I do play the game. I was just suggesting that if he thought the farming 250 was bad, he should probably quit while he's ahead. I made my six weapons already thank you very much. lol
---
their healing venom is pretty strong imo and thieves have a fair amount of condi removal. and ofc tons of stealth
---
I still haven't finished mine. Maybe next year. :P
---
no no this was actual shields.
---
They hover a bit out from your arm rather than being attached.
---
Yup! Most AoE effects and attacks are limited to 5 targets. Some buffs will extend to 10, or something like Meteor Shower hits 3 but drops a bunch of times. So taking on more than 3-5 enemies is harder than it needs to be. :)
---
Enemy drops, unidentified gear, story rewards, leveling rewards, vendors, weaponsmiths, crafting, renown hearts, the trading post, champion bags, WvW and PvP loot boxes and caches, chest hidden and scattered across the world...
---
Gear has a lot of sources.
---
This. Thief is not squishy at all with that trait. Add in the healing signet for maximum overkill
---
The problem is, that you don't have modifiers for toughness. You have a fuckton of modifiers to turn 100 damage into 10.000 damage, but you can't turn your 3.500 armour into 17.000 armour.
---
It was more balanced at release, but pure bunkers get roflblasted by pure glass cannons now thanks to power creep. Instead of a one-shot it's a two-shot, woohoo.
---
No. That is not needed.  Instead, here's your homework:
---
Read the link you gave me again, then stop to think the key element of Story missions that is missing from the "Easy mode" described on that link.
---
Me telling you will not work as well as you figuring it out.
---
There's no need to be nervous. We have GW2 for at least another 2 years. Then if it dies, it ***dies.***
---
My favourite was when someone tagged up for Dry Top sandstorm, then after the first event she stood around for 5 mins, then told us she had no idea where to go next, she only tagged up because there were no tags on the map...
---
Not exactly an asshole, but still wasting everyone's time.
---
Part of Aurene, right? We did fight the actual magics in Kralk, so yeah, hes prolly in Aurene in some form.
---
I doubt most casual players look into settings at all, let alone often enough to notice new features. Such skills should definitely be straight out visible, not just mentioned in some mastery description and hidden deep inside the settings menu.
---
Not yelling, but I *am* annoyed when people don't stack on VB matriarch, so she charges out of the AoE and makes everyone's life a bit more difficult for having to fight on the edge of the platform.
---
/r/BrandNewSentence
---
I doubt that ls5 will have any relations to PoF or current mounts. It might be another standalone season like ls2.
---
Besides, there's 2 utility slots and 4 weapon slots which is quite a lot.
---
Condi stuff in Open world? Thats usually the worst, yes.
---
Absolutely.
---
Yeah, how dare people get hit. No idea how people manage to die in GW2, duels should end whenever one's hand cramps so he can't just loldodgerolluscrub all day long anymore.
---
A bit of clarity never hurt anyone.
---
Been playing since beta. Definitely did not know that any of these skills exist.
---
This year Halloween should be us pretending to be Joko. (With Joko Tonic as a reward)
---
Ahhh, GW2. The only game in existence where it is physically impossible for all participants of a fight to take damage as long as they're a decent player.
---
I crafted the legendary backpiece, but I was unaware you could craft other legendary armor without having to raid?
---
I think... You might enjoy raiding. The story, maps, assets and overall discovery that comes with it, is ***VERY MUCH*** worth it, at least for a single play through. Anyone who feels the same way as you will enjoy raiding, if you are somehow scared about difficulty then don't worry so much, it's not easy but it's not difficult either.
---
One more thing about raiding: The soundtracks are insane. That is all.
---
GW2 has far too many TILs even for people who've been playing since forever *and* visit that subreddit.
---
This is the only thing keeping me from raids. The sheer timesink. I can just play about an hour or 2 each day after work if I wanted. Sure I can "train" for raid content each weekend or when I have some extra time, but it's just not worth it.
---
Just be be clear for others, Mount Ability 1 is not the same thing as the 1 key assigned where the auto attack would be. That is the mount's engage ability.
---
thanks, I didn't even know this place existed :o
---
What's the advantage of having a crafting material bag? I generally just use the "deposit materials" function...
---
I just looked it up on the wiki. I feel silly for getting ascended gear when I have the shards and tickets to get half a set of legendaries. Gifts of prosperity are soooo expensive. The gold and mats could’ve helped. But I’m making nearly 15g daily between tier 3 fractals, fractal encryptions, the daily, and rank pvp. So it will be soon... lol.
---
Here is problem with Warclaw: 
---
i have `q, w, e, r, c` bound for my `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` slots respectively
---
i have `e=v, r=shift` bound for mount skils `1, 2` respectively, works fine for every mount but warclaw in wvw, it's 2 and 3 (e, r) do nothing related to skill panel and i have to click those if needed.
---
It's a cool way to reuse buttons, but when skills are introduced it messes things up.
---
It's to prevent clipping. Gets a bit overzealous at times but the alternative is a shield stuck in your arm/shoulder.
---
just, but only a few additively. so you will not have 48% reduction with all those buffs, you will have 43% because its multiplicative
---
Almost as if the in-game matchmaking for raids isn't ideal.
---
[This \^](http://gph.is/144U86X)  I have always hated the "clear content quick" that comes with any top tier content.
---
Look at the top right, he *is* using adblock.
---
Don't need mount skill 2 on griffon, you can just press 'S' or whatever you have bound to move backwards.
---
Look up to the skies
---
Funny you mention it, just an hour ago I did my first ever 99 cm andluckily didnt have to do more than 1
---
I really like all of the bosses from all fractals, but my one true love is Ensolyss the endless torment.
---
I'd tattoo him on my body if i didn't dislike tattoos so much.
---
High Priestess is a close second next to Mai Trin though.
---
In case anyone is confused by « Razziafelis », that’s the French translation for the Warclaw mount.
---
My buddy plays a mean druid in pvp. It's probably not as good as something like firebrand, but he provides an assload of heals, revives, and can bunker down pretty well when needed. And can still provide a non-negligible amount of damage.
---
My problem with that isn't even the adds, it's the main guy. Literally just teleports behind you and hits you with the nothing personnel kiddo
---
quality shitpost.
---
ITT: ppl that don't get your joke.
---
Hullo friend! I agree, prosthetics would be a great option, even perhaps in character creation. On the same vein: while we're adding all these new chairs in-game, why not add in a neat wheelchair?
---
I think you might be looking too deep into this.
---
I really am just a newbie.
---
I am amongst them. Foud out how to use the griffon two days ago. Had the griffon for a 10 months.
---
I don't agree about decorations not belonging in guild halls, but I'm also not someone that enjoys "personal" housing since I don't see a purpose in prettying it up when very few people would actual visit your personal instance.  Not unless they become players shops too and that doesn't support the TP.  
---
However, I would find great joy in forcing enemies to go over the HUGE GLOBE OF TYRIA just to fall into a hidden trap on the other side.  Can't assault my fortress if you're stuck in a trap.
---
If you own the game and you log in every day, you get transmutation charges for free at least once a week. Free accounts don't get login rewards.
---
If you complete zones you get either a black lion key or a transmutation charge, but usually a transmutation charge. 
---
People who PvP or WvW get transmutation charges from reward tracks.
---
I have hundreds and hundreds of transmutation charges and never bought a single one..but I play a lot and I've been playing since launch.
---
Don’t use any until you’re level 80 with level 80 gear and PROPER stats. Face it you’re gonna look like scrub until then or until you buy an outfit
---
Ahah woopsie, this name is so stupid I'm starting to use this name even when typing in english x)
---
Thanks for pointing it out, edited !
---
Those branded forgotten are hillarious
---
Yes it was the eyes/eyebrows that did it for me!
---
And yes she's incredible, all homemade and home-designed - she inspired me to start doing home grown cosplays myself which I'm hoping to trial out this year with the help of a seamstress :)
---
Won't be the same content, just the same maps. Once the instances are taken over by us all enemies disappear. I just don't see it working that way.  You go to an NCP and ask: What happened here? you get your answer and say, man! I sure wish i could've seen it.
---
It's how i feel about season 1 though, but i don't think i'd revisit the maps just to talk to an NPC.
---
Does warclaw have any special mount abilities that would prevent adding the mount skill1 and to to the weapon skill slots?
---
Dungeon Master lost its prestige after a year or so. With the current power creep, it would probably take less than a month to complete the AP and dungeons become obsolete again.
---
&gt; the issue stems from excessive might and damage-modifier stacking that some builds are capable of
---
Not only this but the general appliance and accessibility to a variety of boons. I came to that realization when someone suggested to give combo fields and finishers some AoE damage to make then have some flavour again. Thinking about this made me realize that in the few years after release you basically had those might stacking situations in dungeon runs in which everyone just unloaded their blast finishers to stack might before engaging the boss. You don't have this today because so many professions have access to a wide variety of boons that can be generated and shared to other party members. I mean, I can keep up 25 stacks of might on my reaper without much problems on my own...
---
And then you have the problem that you mostly have damage modifiers but not defense modifiers.
---
I personally want hammer ranger as well, but was trying to stick to the themes OP had going for the class.
---
And the snakes are part of jehovas witnesses apparently (or exorcising the dragon?)
---
I dont remember if I changed my key binds, but isn't ability 1 'v'?
---
Not salty.. pointing out that players from other game modes such as “PvP and WvW” already know the stealth mechanic is far broken (but we think it needs nerf NOT buff, lol)
---
So nope not salty this is common knowledge for anyone who plays other game modes
---
Looking at any forum discussion regarding thieves makes me want to gorge my eyes out. 
---
It's either people who have no idea to play against thieves or even worse, thieves who have no idea how to play thief and just want to fulfill their edgy one-shot god fantasy by asking Anet to make changes that are absurd at best, and a total display of total ignorance about not only not knowing how the class works but also about how a trait in this game works at worst.
---
Sometimes a static will pool funds together and buy one person of their static a kill so they can progress to the next boss to experience it together if stuck on the prior boss.  It helps some groups if they are butting their heads against the same boss week after week and people are getting... touchy.
---
Joko fell through a plothole and ended up in the pocket dimension where we keep Halloween lore. Sorted.
---
If anything I’d like to see less of those. Right now we have 4th of July when there are 2 or more players fighting anything and fountain of numbers with occasional big splashes of power crits is not helping.
---
It's just an option, if you don't want to change anything you don't have to, but for people who want to, the option should be there. There are no downsides here.
---
One thing I haven't seen in any of these comments also is sometimes you just can't be rezzed. If you had a lag spike when you died, then where you body is on your screen vs. everyone else's isn't the same, and trying to revive just won't work. I usually do try to rez people, but if it doesn't work because of that, I just move on because there isn't anything else I can do. Not saying this is the case you've been experiencing, but it is a possibility.
---
The AMD one.
---
&gt; but you can run around turning damage done from 100 to 10.000.  
---
no. no skill that has innate 100 damage scales that high.
---
&gt; It's a shame that some people have to miss out on good content because of that.
---
But you know. You don't meet this type of things if you don't braindead. If you go with druid-condi-dps - yes, you will be kicked, because that means you idiot who can't use google. Otherwise raid community as toxic as fractals or any other. If you don't do your best - gtfo.
---
...probably your phone
---
There is no OP items in game. Exotic items are not very expensive. They are enough for the tier 1 fractals, dungeons, open world, and raiding if you are talented. Next quality items are Ascended ones, they are %5 more powerful, and have infusion slots.
---
İnfusions are for the Agony resistance.
---
Agony is the damage type you only encounter in fractals.
---
Every item of same color, level and type has same stats. You dont have to worry about items. 
---
Instead you will work to get for skins. Once you equip an item, you will ad its appearance to your wardrobe. In wardrobe, you can customize the looks of your armor.
---
So what to do after returning ?
---
In my opinion, master a class, you can open new one or use existing ones. Leveling rewards you with relaxed fun time and good crafting materials. (Buy salvage kits and break the items you dont use.)
---
In short, do whatever you want, you will automatically get gold and rewards.
---
That could be. I have them bound to side mouse buttons.
---
Wait, can you still actually do the achievements? I thought the fancy scarves were not available past initial week or whatever long that event lasted?
---
Compiled the general mindset in this document, hope it helps.
---
 [http://www.filedropper.com/dragonfall-keyfarm](http://www.filedropper.com/dragonfall-keyfarm)
---
So that was not my weird key setup only...
---
Actually, having an instance where the player pretend to be Joko in front of the Mad King, with maybe kind of a pun battle or something like this sounds like a really fun a cool opportunity. I doubt it'd ever happen, but I'd love to see that.
---
There’s a likely a technical and future proofing reason they aren’t. 
---
Mount abilities can share keybinds with profession skills etc. They currently have some room to add further mount combat skills or use the same system like they did with the aurene flying mission with skills without overlapping said skills. 
---
You can actually bind the skills to 2-3 yourself, but when you enter the aurene mission you can’t trigger the skills on the bar because the mount movement skills take precedence.
---
use arcdps and the addon scrolling combat text (GW2SCT).  
---
i think with arc you can hide all normal numbers which would come from the gw2 interface (never tried out this otion, but its there).
---
Personally I have a beatle and I hate this thing with passion and would never do races on it. I'd rather just buy a scarf...
---
There was the war eternal package deal which included a voucher for a glider / backpack skin of your choice, that's how they got.
---
No it's not discontinued it's just gone until they rotate it back into the store, but nobody can tell you when. Could be 1 month or 2 years.
---
&gt; It's just an option, if you don't want to change anything you don't have to, but for people who want to, the option should be there. There are no downsides here.
---
I was not arguing against the option but rather expressing my point of view.
---
For me it would make a fight less assessable when you have 5 different sources of damage floaters on your screen. If others, like you, have a different opinion then I gladly listen to your arguments on why you think this should happen.
---
I mean, you talk about that direct damage is irrelevant to Condition builds, which it not necessarily is since you can apply conditions on critical strikes, but this would need to be tied to the build you play and the options are not character bound or even bound to a build. Which means you would have to go to the options on every character change to adjust them again.
---
Wouldn't it be a better way to harmonize those floaters and make them equally large but generally smaller? Crits should still be larger than general damage numbers though.
---
[removed]
---
The white and black wings will be back at some point.  I don't think any item they have sold is gone forever, they always come back at some point.
---
The drops are normal if you are playing in a populated area. GW2 doesn't care what you have. Only single core performance is important.
---
I remember discovering the casual fractal chest could be sold, being able to buy it and get the one fractal weapon skin I wanted (sword) was amazing at a time when I never thought I'd be able to do fractals myself.
---
Why do you want to see numbers popping up? Just focus on your rotation and keep an eye on ArcDPS
---
...I just learned this now. :(
---
Ahhh that I can respect lol
---
Uhm, this all is exactly why I suggest visualizing them separately, similar to the Special Action key, and not onto the weapon skill bar.
---
You've gotta' get on at the right times though, monday evenings seem to be the busiest by far.
---
You know an easy way to give people an easy way to see a description? An icon on their UI
---
I only use the infinite volatile magic and unbound magic ones
---
*happy Keanu Reeves noises*
---
Yea actually! I was telling him that I had to pay attention to when the menders showed up or else I'd die to reflect damage.
---
Personally I stick with unbound or volatile magic, sometimes glyph of bounty if I want to focus a specific material.
---
Something I found helps with the moving them around, is equip each character with a full set of Ori tools and place the 3 infinite tools in the shared slots. Then when I log into a character I simply have to open inventory and double click each infinite tool to equip it, and then when I'm done or want to move to another toon another quick double click on each Ori tool puts them back, since the Ori tools sort of reserve their spot in the shared slots.
---
Minion creation varies from dragon to dragon, with some able to be created via other minions but that doesn’t mean already existing minions can’t act while their dragon was asleep. 
---
EoTN showed one of primordus’ minions actively producing new ones before he awoke.
---
It also showed a sleeping minion of Jormag corrupt Svanir.
---
They even had the pale tree growing hundreds of years before Mordremoth awoke. GW2 gave us the Sylvari, from more than one tree. Scarlett’s antics connected her to Mordremoth’s mind while he slept, where he was able to manipulate her into awakening him early. 
---
Primordus wasn’t shown to be able to actively do anything while sleeping but a minion of his from a previous awakening could. Both Jormag(or minion) and Mordremoth have shown psychic abilities which could be used while asleep under certain conditions. 
---
Zhaitan as far as we know had to awaken before he had any control over his minions. We know they still exist free of control when he died, it’s possible some pre-awakening undead were unchained minions from a previous awakening. 
---
The only kralk minions we know of pre-awakening were freed from his control long before he awoke so that’s a different situation and the latest story expands on them to be actual family rather than minion though.
---
I responded like this, because that's how I experienced the raid community. And we can read here again and again from other people that had horrible experiences with the raid community. People get dealt with, like they are trash, kicked at the last boss when he at 25%, kicked despite not failing mechanics nor weak performance, ect.  ect.
---
You imply, people need to play shit builds or be really crappy in order to "get rightfully shit on". But that's not true and that's why I keep my distance from this content. It's a magnet for the ill mannered people, like PvP content.
---
so you get a full ascended armor for free ?
---
hey guys i'm backing to the game after 1 year, any big changes that i must know? Any farm changes?
---
I'm trying to figure what was said about the meta that ended on this interpretation by the artits. First of all, we can all agree OP didn't mention camps or camp upgrades unless those are represented by the 3 bodies on the floor but I don't think so.
---
To me, this entire drawing is focused on the fight against kralkatorrik. OP said something about *fighting a dragon that's just resting there on the floor after getting magic overdose indigestion and a lot of people die in the process but when a weak spot opens, you have to fight menders that try to heal the purple dragon. I did mention it was purple, right?*
---
I think I understand what you want (as looks go)
---
 [Touch of Madness](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Touch_of_Madness) may be the answer for you.
---
Weaver elite spec for elementalist is super fun and challenging!  A less important reason that I like it is that it's not one of the classes that \_everyone\_ is playing (ie mesmer, necro, or warrior).
---
i disagree, i see thief as a healing profession with ability to use all weapons just not swap.
---
The Monk: Heal allies with the shadow magic with skills like Shadow Meld, Aura of Displacement and Shadow Walk. Copy foes stances with Mirrored Stance and form your own with way of the fox!
---
*your* Charizard has never disobeyed you due to level. You might be thinking of Ash's. Even in Generation 1, the obedience mechanic *only* applies to traded Pokémon.
---
&gt; A good UI is about clarity,
---
And not about filling up your screen with bunches of unnecessary icons. We are talking about movement keys, not combat skills. Combat skills needs way more desription and are changing whenever your change your weapon/build. But movement keys are fix. 
---
Do you need an UI icon to know that W is moving forward, S is moving backwards, space is jumping and and and? It's the exact same thing with mount movement. You get your notification and if you forget, you are always able to look into your key bindings.
---
The amount of people that left groups because they thought the group sucked but didn't know this bug was a thing.
---
"Praise Jokatorrik!"
---
I personally would like a full support spec for warrior
---
If you don't want to have to bother with your looks while you're levelling up, an outfit will cover your armour, and you can turn the outfit on and off as often as you like. While most outfits are only available for gems, there is also one that you can get from the trading post for a few silver:  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless\_Common\_Clothing\_Tonic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Common_Clothing_Tonic)   
---
Just buy the tonic and convert it to an outfit as described on the wiki page. Then you can apply all your interesting new gear as you level up, and spend the transmutation charges when you're ready to commit to a set and a look
---
Can I get the non math version
---
That's great! The best compliment for creators is seeing people inspired by their work! Good luck with your project then, I hope you'll have a ton of fun and get to know many people with your same passion! ;)
---
Some really good insights here.
---
Although in the first half you are explaining the hyperbola in a really complicated way.
---
Yea, we need more UI clutter. Good idea! I like it.
---
They're countless *because* you can't see them in the lfg!
---
Me warrior main, me thanks you
---
&gt;It's the exact same thing with mount movement
---
it's completely not though. they keybind for forward is always forward. mount ability 2 is:
---
griffon: ascend
---
roller bettle: drift
---
skyscale: descend
---
mount ability 2 should be visible in the ui the exact same way weapon ability 2 should be because it changes.
---
Reading mount descriptions, npc dialogues, and mastery/skill/traits tooltips helps one learn more about the game than not doing any of that.
---
What animation? the thief only appeared AFTER I got hit and got a Revealed debuff. As said by ChmSteki, you die on the first one.
---
O: thanks!
---
They could probably tutorialize this instead of cluttering the UI a little more (not that your implementation is garish by any means, I think it's rather tastefully done). But... you know... Anet and tutorials.
---
Back then I just changed the dyes to match and create a new look each piece. It was kinda fun.
---
f
---
&gt;  People get dealt with, like they are trash
---
Because they are? They tried to chatlink instead of go to training runs. So they are getting what they deserved. 
---
&gt; kicked at the last boss when he at 25%
---
Unless you did not knew it - you can't be kicked at 25% unless you triggered someone really hard. Because you can't kick someone while you in fight with boss. 
---
&gt; But that's not true 
---
Remove pink glasses. Face reality. Pugs gets kicked for either low dps (low performance) or failing mechanics.
---
&gt; that's why I keep my distance from this content
---
Because you can't do something so you blame everyone else saying that they are toxic elitist, but you are good. It's just they are bad. Yeah?
---
I've been playing since the very first beta, got 5000 hours into the game, and only now learned about the 'drag&amp;drop'.
---
Yeah, I unlocked both the normal and the golden scarf by simply doing enough races and getting all gold times in the time trials (I believe the latter awarded me with the golden one)
---
BASH THE DRAGON
---
25th... ergghhh whyyy... I suppose I got 3 days to farm the hell outta it. :P
---
Hahaha, goddamit. Of course they come as soon as I decided to switch my sights on Golden Angel Wings. Thank you all for the info! Hope you all have a good one.
---
We have a steady stream of content as of lately, noice
---
Why does this set include a total makeover kit when the outfit completely covers you?
---
It would be cool to have the Grove involved too, seeing as they have a huge stake in bashing dragons.
---
I think they mean that it feels like the Norn didn't really care about Kralkatorrik, you'd think the Charr or Ebonhawke would be more suited to celebrate Kralk's death. But Hoelbrak is probably the only map open enough to host something like that event now.
---
Nice to see this back.  Since we've smashed a couple more dragons since the first one.
---
The Charr in Thunderhead Peaks got inspired by the Commander's taunting and started a book club. They're still not sure what it is... so they've riveted books to an iron bar and are beating the shit out of each other. They think this is fantastic.
---
Dont worry m8 i got u, have an upvote!
---
As well as bashes in terms of parties
---
SAB is hosted in Rata Sum also, so hopefully we find something to party about for the Black Citadel &amp; Grove
---
Yeah same, I fly out on the 29th
---
Having grown increasingly bored with the repeating of events since launch, I'm ridiculously excited for this. For one, it isn't in LA or DR but instead its hosted in Hoelbrak. A city that I've always loved more than most of the others for sure, and now it seems the festival has received some updates &amp; overall love.    
---
Most importantly, I hope that this is a sign of things to come with more events getting touched up &amp; changed a little bit. Anything but the same old same old events is a bonus for me. Can't wait.
---
I thought Dragon Bash was a GW1 festival, not one dedicated to the death of ED-s :o
---
Ha! Nice
---
You have a home instance in Frostgorge?
---
That's how I like about GW2.
---
We have a total of 6 annual festivals now :D
---
Idk, maybe you want to turn the helm off and also look different.
---
Filler items probably.
---
The appearance packages (even though it's lot labeled the same way) usually contain a total makeover, though that's usually paired with a handful of a dye kit (flipping through of the historical ones on the wiki)
---
medium has the https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Scout%27s_armor mask. two dye channels (the outer edge and the middle)
---
Daily Shiverpeaks Vista Viewer is a good one too, there's one right near a Waypoint
---
https://youtu.be/-4jdgMPACII?t=29
---
looks like a more different version of holo dragon wings and a holo helm too.
---
There is so much sass in this I love it
---
I would pay for a hammer skin like that! Haha
---
More efficient to Home Portal Stone to Salma District then go to Wayfarer Foothills, Bitterfrost Frontier, Frostgorge Sound, etc.
---
Or get it while waiting for first/post reset Ley Line Anomaly in Timerline :D
---
yep, standard appearance package filler, though the transmutation charges are an even cheaper filler than the dye kits they usually have.
---
Mine is more mundane, FFXIV Shadowbringers is the 28th for me.
---
And it looks so good hosting Dragon Bash!
---
The axe is a bit weak but the rest of it looks cool. Kinda sad that such a cool design is just tossed into the Gem Store and not story related (yet).
---
These are similar, indeed I used to wear those on my charr and looked very nice.
---
Wrong.
---
Two hours is plenty of time to "train" on at least 3 bosses, RAIDS IN THIS GAME ARE NOT FUCKING DIFFICULT THIS IS CASUAL WARS 2 FOR FUCK'S SAKE.
---
Spend 30 minutes -once- watching some boss guides and you're good to go forever.
---
Spend 30 minutes -once- learning the basics of a rotation for your meta build of choice, and you're good to go forever.
---
Source: I lead trainings every damn week, the runs last for 2 hours and we clear wings 1-4 at least, no matter how new people are.
---
that makes the Black Citadel the only race town that doesnt have a fest yet.
---
I need the white wing on 1 of my character. xP
---
The choya tools look really cute and I‘d buy the rest of the set if the logging tool wouldn’t randomly stop after 2 hits and still does not do 4 hits like the unbound tools.
---
Did you know that they can also Dodge forward? But it doesn't use the regular Dodge key or doubletapping
---
Think we'll get some sort of plot twist like the original Dragon Bash?
---
&gt; Like how you can right click wobbly chests/hearts and get stuff instantly.
---
&gt; 
---
To be fair, that's relatively new. I mean... Sept-Nov 2017 "new", but relatively new compared to the age of the game.
---
If you just do daily logins they literally hand them to you. They are not hard to get at all.
---
Drive it right back in to its den.
---
I don't believe the Grove has a festival
---
No I have adblock
---
Makes a little more sense to me to hold it in the Black Citadel since the last dragon we killed was the one harassing the charr the most, and we haven't killed Jormag yet.
---
But at least it's a festival not held in Divinity's Reach or LA.
---
In Guild Wars it is the[Dragon Festival](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dragon_Festival)
---
&gt; The Dragon Festival is an ancient Canthan tradition. After the assassination of Emperor Angsiyan at the hands of Shiro Tagachi and the catastrophe of the Jade Wind which threatened to wipe out and destroy the empire of Cantha, newly crowned emperor, Emperor Hanjai, the son of Angsiyan, turned this ancient tradition into a large scale celebration in order to unite the empire in its reconstruction.
---
The festival marks the anniversary of establishing the settlement on Shing Jea Island as well as the expansion of Kaineng City to accommodate the refugees from the areas hit hardest by the Jade Wind. The Dragon Festival has come to symbolize the survival of the Empire of the Dragon (Cantha) in the face of that calamity.
---
lol all this time I though Dragon Bash was only the instanced pvp activity. 
---
I just remembered now that it was that event (festival) that made mobs drop bags that gave the ticket for jade weapons. I remember that as a great thing. I hope those bags will be added again (updated with sadly an another useless infusion as the unicorn drop).
---
Oh I'm excited:-)
---
LMAO the timing on this thread and todays gemstore update is perfect.
---
To be fair, the raid was originally supposed to be part of the same release as War Eternal!

Perhaps, combined with PvE/PvP/WvW events, we'll eventually release the Gw1-like point of constantly having some kind of event going on, whether it's a festival or some kind of bonus rewards. With this new festival, festivals will cover 21/52 weeks of the year. We've also gotten 8 weeks of bonus events in the past year, if you include the two week-end only events.
---
Its both.
---
What? Don't you like the bottomless pit that festivities are spaced all around?
---
Being serious, the central pavilion in Hoelbrack always seemed like a best-fit for holidays. Especially Wintersday with the already-present winter vibe and sense of community would be so much better in Hoelbrak than made to fit around a massive pit.
---
I stopped playing any video games, but gw2 I stopped about 3 years ago after playing from start till 2017, I’m glad this is coming back finally it looks so fun!
---
Grove itself is a festival
---
A circus festival
---
With plants

Meanwhile, in Belgium, [package not available for no know reason](https://imgur.com/LDoe0Ai) ... :(
---
the go fast Point is central
---
Those are terrible...
---
TRASH THE DRAGON
---
Came here to say that lol.
---
But it actually makes some sense... who else but the Norn would hold an entire festival dedicated to the slaying of Dragons?
---
Agreed. I really don't want it to become Mount Wars 2. It already feels that way at meta events with both the land AND sky cluttered.
---
New outfit
---
Pick one:
---
\[  \] a sense of pride and accomplishment
---
\[  \] 1200 gems
---
Cynicism aside, the outfit looks really good.
---
See if you can purchase the recipe from the laurel vendor
---
Does this festival have any way to make some easy gold like Halloween bags and red envelopes?
---
in most group content (Fractals, raids) you're going to be expected to be in melee range regardless of if you're using a ranged weapon alot of the time
---
that said, power chrono with a greatsword (this is a ranged weapon for a mesmer) and the domination/dueling traitlines is pretty great as a DPS and function fully ranged if you want
---
That's really interesting. The best thing you can do when something like this happens is to record. I use a tool that lets me record the last five minutes of any gameplay I've experienced. So if I go through something weird, I just save it.
---
We’re still getting the four winds festival in July right? Just asking because that’s my absolute favorite!
---
Otherwise, hell yes! More festivals, more content, more to do woooo!
---
I can hear her laughing
---
So yeah... gonna need that helm at 0:28...
---
Meatoberfest Xtreme
---
Because most players here are PvE players who don't do or very rarely do WvW and their opinion is that WvW is whining about everything and there for what ever we post it will get downvoted to oblivion. 
---
Funny thing though the same people moaning about the whiny WvW players contribute with whiny PvE posts and fill up reddit with it day in and day out, but some how this is different.....
---
Festival Wars 2
---
Meatoberfest
---
it tooke me dozens of failed griff adventures and asking Map chat several times why I can't pull up high enough... 'oh well you have to hold space? while diving to flap harder, dive harder, then you can pull up higher'
---
wen I said that it makes no sense they hide that skill in the mastery text Map chat jumped all over me fo not reading content well enough...
---
How do I do all of these? I am one of those people that is still in the dark about these mount features...
---
I bet some ANet devs read threads like this and tell themselves: "wow, we've catered so much to lazy people over the years, that now we have a community comprised of some loud idiots that can't even read all the information we provide in the game itself to help them."
---
Lol now my Ipod commercial has meaning
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxiuBzI9ji4&amp;t=2s
---
Wow, Hoelbrak and also a better trailer than the raid.
---
*fastt*
---
That still requires initiating the attack before the stealth.
---
I always have a reason to do cooking at Hoelbrak.
---
I joined a wvw guild a few years ago but only recently started playing the game mode with them and HOT DOG is it a good time.
---
I'm in the camp of "I've known about it all along but mostly play WvW and am too lazy to bind a key for the skill and just disappoint myself everytime I could actually use it".
---
Forgot about that restriction, but the result is the same (just tested it). The collection event for stage 2 seems to still be running though. [Screens](https://imgur.com/a/2f7DPfJ)
---
Hopefully with this festival we are celebrating last ED slayed with us moving on and leaving the rest ED-ish stuff to Aurene!
---
Well, I thought about that, but it still seems strange.
---
So you get 2 sets of Ascended armor as you complete the Envoy achievements.   
---
Envoy 1 is yours to keep forever. Choose any weight class you want, ideally not the same weight class as your intended Legendary Armor.  
---
Envoy 2 is a component of your Legendary Envoy Armor, therefore you lose it when you craft your Legendary set. Whatever weight class you pick for Envoy 2 determines the weight class of your Legendary.
---
For best results, I find that you (a) hold the drift button, (b) DON'T touch any other movement buttons, (c) use right-click camera control to point in the direction you *want* to be facing ASAP after pressing the drift button, and (d) release the drift button once you're actually facing the desired direction (will take a little bit, during which you will keep moving in the direction you were originally moving). It definitely takes practice.
---
Really hope they decide to use [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fYmmlYDsQU) as the main menu theme again.
---
I hope they use Mists Stranger for an actual character design. So disappointing that all these great outfits aren't actually being used ingame.
---
At the very least they should use Mists Stranger in future fractal CMs.
---
The aura has two dye channels.
---
Too confusing for new and veteran players.
---
Ah yes, for the mentor tag, I do agree. I meet dick mentors more often than not. Kind of a meme at this point.
---
i run full glass builds and solo champs, its not impressive tho.
---
Def buying that gem store skin. I don't even use hammers on any characters currently. (That would change.)
---
Well, yes, but actually no
---
Oh but it is the home of the bigger human
---
Today is your lucky day.
---
Black and white wings are in store.
---
This is my solution too. Highly recommended.
---
It´s a super old event (2014? 15?) , so no way to know. 
---
I bet my 2 cents that they will re-intruce the holographic wings in some type of bags, same as others festivals.
---
This is unexpected. I would have preferred a new festival, but still gotta appreciate it. Hope it's permanent and not just for now once.
---
Also please let there be a minigame where we bully Sons of Svanir.
---
I can't get gold on the Brisban track and I desperately want that golden scarf. 😔
---
At least we have [Meatoberfest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Meatoberfest)! Lots of fresh meat, worm eggs, beer, fireworks, humans to kill and Azalus Poisontongue to spank from time to time…. folks at Butcher's Block sure know how to throw a party!
---
Last year it ran from end of July to Aug. so at the earliest it might be the 23rd of July, but I expect it to start the 6th of August to separate them out a bit more.
---
Taddaaaa.. and I'm the one with the pink glasses. :)
---
As is if people never blame somebody else for fails, nor they'd ever lie or anything bad like that. It's only the noobs that would do such things, but never would an elitist  wrongly accuse anybody of playing bad or try to blame them for failed attempts, ect. Noooooooooooo...
---
I hope I was able to explain my point to anybody reading this. Thanks you Dante for being a very good example for why the ride community is as small as it is.
---
Is it just me, or is that the first time they've used the original GW2 logo for a trailer?
---
I suppose it makes sense now that S4 has ended, which was the conclusion to Path of Fire's story.
---
it's cool and all but still an old content , they just brought back an old festival :/
---
Concidering that the Dragon ball arena is now lunar new year content I also thought that they scrapped Dragon Bash. I never was that glad to be proven wrong.
---
Simple Awesome !
---
Original GW2 logo seems back
---
Or as an alternative, do not make them until you have the all the items you need to make the ultra shiny weapons in one go.
---
My impatience has gotten the better of me this time again...
---
Erm most every top holo build is kitless. Egun is the only decent kit to run with holo and even then the lockout makes an elixir a better slot.
---
wt,,,you are so lucky
---
The one skill will actually dismount you upon reaching the ground, while the v key will dive and then land.
---
Isn't this the Shadowstalker Outfit from PoE though?
---
Imo, a wardrobe unlock isn't what should unlock it, the achievement should. 
---
Weird in any case, probably a bug.
---
Is there a way to reomove the "Destabilized Magic" and "Enter The Hidden City of Ahdashim" quests from my hud?
---
They're taking up a lot of space and hiding other quests I'm working on, especially in Dragonfall event runs.
---
"Don't be alarmed-he's a hologram too!" yeah I remember the watchwork knights. Something is up here players, something will go down at this festival, IF nothing else something something sons of Savanir attack or  something
---
OH MY GOD, I am actually super hyped!
---
I missed the first Dragon Bash and felt sad.
---
Now, no more!
---
I'm not 100% sure how the game does its combat recording, so this is just a guess, but is it possible that they took the trait to hit multiple targets and they hit both you and other people which caused the damage to get so high?
---
Even if you are counting power and ferocity, no 100x multipliers are far from possible. The very maximum would be somewhere around 20x. That is counting power and ferocity.
---
Joko shares a VA with one of the player character choices, so it shouldn't be too difficult.
---
Waiting for a fun elite spec
---
I'm the kind of person to just look at all the settings before starting the game.
---
Well, he's never *really* had the opportunity to fuck with the afterlife realm.
---
It does seem like Anet is coming back and using previously released outfits. The Zephyrite in the recent episode (and probably past episodes too, just never noticed until now) use the Crystal Savant armor
---
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy!
---
I was certain that got nerfed pretty quickly.
---
Why not since we've bashed 3 dragons!
---
well, there are svanir in hoelbrak
---
What would be a good class to use the free set of Diviner gear from the new map? I pretty much just spend all of my time in open world pve (no pvp/wvw/raids at all, very limited t1 frac) and would hate to just waste a free set of gear.
---
ITS HAPPENNIIINNG 
---
MY LOINS
---
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvYjXF11k8I) is how.

Rangers can stack a their mechanics that allows for some ludicrous single hits.

There are dozens of us. Dozens.
---
That's some good camo, took me while to notice the sylvari
---
With full zerker, power sigil stacks, might, item set/buff % damage bonuses, utilities/food, and the "Sic 'em" command, that doesn't seem out of place or too near the top end for damage.
---
I used to run a multi map iron farm and can confirm this spot is the best
---
Mount specific races do a good job in that IMO, though it is possible to get gold in all Beetle races without drifting.
---
I'm excited. I never got to attend the dragon bash before. Really feels cool they're doing this right after we cracked Kralky, what an immersive event.
---
What a festive trailer. I'm impressed.
---
Hey I get hit for 25k with gunflame if I go full glass.
---
Use some toughness in there you’ll see some luck in there.
---
Better idea. Lets get rid of stealth instead. Stealth is such a broken cheese ability without any real counters. We don't need to buff stealth. Over the years I've seen stealth classes kill people without even leaving stealth, attack and re-stealth faster than you can even try to target them,  DEs that killed entire havocs that couldn't fight back and so on. No OP, screw you and your desire for yet even more one sided troll fights.
---
I stopped playing about 6-4 years ago.Back then, I was TP fanatic and wanted to hit the gold limit. Sadly, I burnt-out and needed a break. This was my final investment that I made, so when I came back I would be "rich" as fuck.
---
You have shared inventory slots for being on a long hiatus?
---
I want more Joko.
---
“Putting in the effort to complete harder content should be more rewarding anyways.” It is. Like I’ve said, the reward is the experience. Games are not meant to have a carrot-on-a-stick model because it encourages dopamine dependence, much like a drug. Maybe this is why the MMO genre is really dragging its feet.
---
I could see her making a coat out of 101 branded dogs.
---
DON’T BE THAT WAY, BITCH
---
I actually hope it goes worse, give me that plot twist that sends us right into S5.
---
What are those ?
---
Submit a support ticket. I got the olmakhan mantle from wvw and it unlocked.
---
They had to change the achievements because it originally had the chestpiece and not the boots.
---
I would assume that to be in LA because of the portals, but maybe LA could give up one of the others. Halloween already used to have content in the black citadel so maybe Halloween?
---
Short version of Dragon Bash:
---
Dragon Bash showed up during Season 1 - no longer available as S1 was designed as temporary content, each release lasting 2 or 4 weeks - as a celebration of surviving against the Elder Dragons, but also as an attempt by a Canthan member of the Captain's Council, [Hao Luen](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Captain_Hao_Luen), to bring one of his ancestor's festivities, Dragon Festival, back.
---
Dragon Festival was a celebration of the Celestial Dragon, one of the Celestials revered by Canthans, and the one most revered (Celestials being elevated souls of heroes, emperors, or other important individuals who now make up constellations). But with the Elder Dragons' rise, people of Tyria grew to despise dragons (especially norn and asura), so Hao Luen turned the festival of celebrating dragons to a festival of celebrating survival against dragons. Dragon Festival was also GW1's in-game festival for the Fourth of July.
---
In the S1 release, there was a controversial subplot about whether or not it was right to celebrate dragons (or survival against). Wonder if that'll return...
---
A note about the announcement being that the last Dragon Bash was celebrating Zhaitan's defeat - it kinda-was-kinda-wasn't. ArenaNet had this wishy-washy attitude about the placement of S1, as they were trying to make the Living World be an "in the now" set up, rather than post-Personal Story explicitly. So they didn't make any global statements of Zhaitan's death during it, but had some dialogue saying such if you were on a character who completed the PS.
---
I'm running berserker weapons and armor with marauder trinkets. Vampirism runes for commanding, berserker runes for following. Weapons are greatsword with bloodlust/absorption and dagger/axe with energy/absorption. I run Discipline/Defense for commanding and Strength/Defense for following. I'm not sure if the dagger is a mainstay. I like the boon rips and leap finishers but losing main hand axe is a trade-off for damage.
---
Far Shiverpeaks very much please, the Norn are treated worse than the dredge these days in terms of significance. A Cantha expansion will mean even more human vebtred story and that'd be humans abusing the storyline because they made the game.
---
First Dragon Bash was excellent.  It was before megaservers so me and my friend went to guest on Ehmry Bay.  We ran around for a few hours getting coffers with just on the map.  It was a good 500g/hr if not more.  We were laughing the whole time.  He ended up buying mats he needed for his Bifrost and I saved mine and eventually bought the perm TP, bank, and merch contracts all for about 1500g total.  Then we settled down and enjoyed the event as more people caught on and the coffer prices dropped.
---
I would like to see new content though.  Repeating events and the cookie cutter LW maps are getting old.  Dragonfall was a nice change though.  A good meta and all the masteries + mounts put to good use.
---
So you are saying the inherent problem here is keeping the game going? This argument should be in a vacuum outside of game stability. The experience is the reward, not the carrot. Carrot-on-a-stick produces reward-seeking behaviors and those are not healthy in the real world because a lot of important things don’t have noticeable rewards.
---
I get a weirdly ominous vibe from some parts of the trailer, I'm wondering if something might happen during the event
---
Neat, thanks!
---
There were no update today though.
---
Let me guess, another rng-based event that I’ll be disappointed with?
---
It is one of the dye colors. You can actually play with them on the preview window. Equip the outfit, and then open TP and search dyes and preview them too, you can actually dye the outfit on preview and see how different dyes look with the different channels.
---
Your math is fucked up, at a guess you're assuming the daredevil doesn't have traits at all, let alone boons.
---
I didn't know how the griffon worked until the zephyrite event because that included an actual tutorial. I could tell there was something I didn't know based on seeing other fliers but had no idea what and was just happy I had the mount.
---
I still don't use any secondary skills besides the wolf's because I forget about them.
---
Wait what holy shit I can do that?
---
It holds a key that will let you own all of Tyria.
---
Noob question but what is a bubble bomb?
---
it's bugged I'm pretty sure. Even if you consider the mechanic stack, this is the only ranger skill that hit that hard. Maul or Wordly Impact never do that much damage.
---
You seem to be a few hours late ...
---
... I've never wanted to learn how to play Warrior until this montage. Awesome bombs my guy.
---
&gt; From there I'm not sure, it seems he just uses his skill (either greatsword S2 or axe S3) and it does a ton of damage?
---
For reasons you have explained.
---
Call of the Wild -&gt; Heal -&gt; Smoke Assault -&gt; Merge -&gt; Maul -&gt; Sic' Em -&gt; Your nuke of choice.
---
It's all about stacking modifiers and buffs to beef up a single skill. The obvious drawback to playing like this: If it doesn't hit for any reason you essentially useless for another 30 seconds.
---
power soulbeast can easily do it. Berserker can easily do it. It's boringly easy to get that kind of scaling.
---
Yeah, I'm totally one of them.  I mean, I even knew they had those abilities because we could train for them via masteries, but I had and still have no idea how to use them.  I've tried binding them, but they just don't seem to work.  So I kind of gave up and have never used them.
---
I'm so hyped for this. They're even putting in Hoelbrak like I was hoping them to if they ever brought it back! It fits so perfectly with the Norn culture, the projector goes great with the central area where it normal projects the spirits in the sky above their respective halls/houses/dens(?), the song sounds like a hearty hunter's celebration/bar song, and the activities just fit so well with something you'd imagine the Norn doing. I'm so happy right now! :D
---
&gt; Or that you can drag drop items to preview window to see em rather than go "click - preview" routine.
---
Holy shit...for real?
---
- Opening Strike up
---
- Warhorn 5
---
- Heal (WHAO)
---
- Merge Pet - 24 might
---
- GS 2 without hitting anything gives you Attack of Opportunity
---
- Sick 'Em
---
- 1 shot
---
So what, people just grind this dragon ball z event for dragon jade weapon skins?
---
That's absolute tosh. ONE trait with on-hit damage and full zerkers gear gives a higher multiplier than that.
---
["This functionality will be brought back in a future *planned build*"](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/951759/#Comment_951759)
---
also there was no update/release today, only a bug fix last night.
---
also they aren't dodgy. they said what needed to be said for now, explaining what happened and why, and how they are going to handle this issue soon™.
---
the validity of their stance on the matter is another topic.
---
rules of book club
---
1st RULE: You do not talk about BOOK CLUB.
---
2nd RULE: You DO NOT talk about BOOK CLUB.
---
Thanks.  I know some of those words. . .also. . .one. . .the. . . with. . .oh, subplot!  I know that one.
---
Honestly, an entire world, literally, to learn about. Can be a bit intimidating.
---
It is impossible, I have more supply then demand. I expect them to drop to 1s to 3s. Regardless, It seems I won't be staying to play for long.Don't feel the same enjoyment as I once did.
---
Yeah I'm usually fine with just one other person there even, but solo is just a nightmare, esspecially in HoT
---
TIL maul doesn't need to hit to get the buff
---
5k power is not possible. Even if it was, that is a 4x multiplier.
---
the solution is quite clear, nerf thief
---
Halloween is the one festival I feel *can't* be anywhere except Lion's Arch.
---
It's too tied to Mad King Thorn
---
Strawmanning would be putting you in a position weaker than you actually are.
---
I'm making assumptions you know more than you appear to actually know, and are basing your claims on more than fee fees. That's known as ironmanning in debate. 
---
&gt; it has an extra huge multiplier.... That is not a "multiplier" 
---
This kind of thing makes it really hard to take you seriously.
---
Well dont go too far back, you might hit prebuff condis where bleed stacked at 20 and others at 1 stack. Scary times for condi classes.
---
5k power is not possible. Your original argument did not even include boons. I do not need to *try* again. My original point is unbroken.
---
[Ferocious](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ferocious_(Archetype)) - +200 power +200 ferocity from merging with a ferocious pet (any pet that give wordly impact when merged).
---
Literally what. Ad hominem and strawman is all you have done. Bring forward a number.
---
DRIVE IT RIGHT BACK INTO ITS DEN
---
Perfect timing for making the point of everyone arguing that damage modificators are out of control. I love you.
---
While true, I also enjoy seeing cities undergo a thematic change to match the holiday, adding wintery or spooky or whatever touches to really transform the city.
---
Am i the only one a little irritated that an outfit/theme that seems extraordinarily lore important is not seen in pve or referenced in game yet is offered on gemstore with no context?
---
Then again maybe it's not important and it won't be referenced beyond this but it doesn't look that way. 
---
It comes across as cheap in terms of immersion...? The gemstore can't lead storytelling or we have a problem.
---
Is it really that hard to say - Yes we made a mistake. We are going to rectify it but it’s looking like we won’t be able to put this back in for another month because it’s not just a simple switch. 
---
Also the raid was a pretty big part of the patch, not communicating any of those changes in the patch notes for that very same patch... is a huge oversight if so. 
---
And the fact that their communication is so bad that them saying anything makes you happy is telling too... it shouldn’t be that way.
---
I still have the holographic wings from back in the day, one of the best backpiece skins
---
And if they said it was being in the next patch and for some reason it wasn't ready for the next patch, all hell would break loose.
---
What do those mean in French? Google says faucher means mower, but I have no idea what fauchemort means.
---
We already literally gave you a build that does it, and you went 'no, we aren't talking about deadeye'.
---
Kindly fuck off.
---
I've always enjoyed the idea that LA has a subset of each holiday, while the main events will be in the specific race's city.
---
For example, LA would get a few SAB related gimmicks, then in Rata Sum is the actual SAB event. This would mean LA is treated as more of a notice that a holiday is going on more than anything, and it also means more cities made to look holiday-y.
---
Hahahaha ok kid. Even with JUST zerkers you get x2.5 without counting crits. Your numbers were just wrong in every way.
---
I want to see some Sons of Svanir there being all drunk cause their "Spirit" is asleep and have nothing to do.
---
Because Factions was thematically unique and beautiful, so obviously people want to go back and see it in a new light in GW2.
---
Also... RITUALIST PLEEAAASE
---
insert surprised pikachu face
---
Again, deadeye doesn't count. It is a single skill. That is not a true multiplier. I will assume you do truly have nothing (part assumption, part just knowing because there IS nothing). So yeah, fucking off now.
---
Number.
---
Came here to say this. Save up your volatile magic and get at least the second level of it, and do a few of the meta runs. Mostly focus on tagging as many mobs as you can and the karma will come racking in.
---
Congrats on still making it sound like a pain in the ass when "games as a chore" is a dead meme in the current year
---
Your Damage is wrong, the multiplier is 1.5 in WvW. One of the few skills I have seen that is actually more in PvP/WvW modes. 
---
That actually made me laugh pretty hard when I was it was .25 higher.
---
Also, would be very nice if Skyscale's descend was the same button as Griffon's dive.. I get mixed up with those too often. Which is any amount at all.
---
Wasn't aware of this API. Does ANet still turn a blind eye to third party plugins?
---
And precursors are craftable now? Sucks for people who dumped money into the MF.
---
Why would I do it again after you dismissed it once? Been there, done that.
---
For open world in particular, a damage-oriented guardian would enjoy it the most, since it will allow you to more easily cap your most important boons: Retaliation, Fury, and Might. An elementalist might also appreciate it depending on the build.
---
Don't kid yourself, **MEATOBERFEST EXTREME** would bring in everyone.
---
Go back to the start of the discussion. That is the entire context of discussion. IF you wanted to talk about permanent multipliers to damage, then we need to talk about permanent increases to defence, and either way that's not what I've ever been talking about.
---
[LWS3](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_3) is great for gearing toons because of how easily the maps give gear. Bitterfrost Fronteir specifically has 4 pieces of ascended gear you can get from it. They're usually very easy to farm as well.
---
Those are all raid builds, and the questioner mentioned they spend all of their time in open world. Quickness Firebrand is okay, but open world DPS core guardian would like it better.
---
What is it with you idiots and not reading the context of posts. I'm not bothering to re-explain things that were already covered in the original discussion. Go back up and read the conversation properly before you jump in going 'well ahchtuallyyyyy'
---
Accurate.

“Erm” lol yeah I am aware that there are kitless holo builds that are popular right now. I’m looking forward to trying them out but I’m very rusty.
---
I deleted something important a few weeks back. It only took a couple of days via email to get everything back. It was a lot faster than I thought it would be.
---
Bad news, Dragon Bash isn't Norn centric unless they've massively changed it.
---
You see Soulbeasts become one with their pet every day!
---
Skins for each cosplay will be edited as usual into this comment. If you missed them when i posted before, then here is also [D'va](https://i.imgur.com/tyrJi3r.png) and [Black Cat D'va (Made by Jenpai)](https://i.imgur.com/p56yfRU.png).
---
&gt; If they bring em back could it be a possible link to the Jade Sea, aka Cantha?
---
No, why? It wasn't a link the first time, why would it be now?
---
Yoooo reworked Halloween festival with joko stuff, i'm in.
---
Does anyone know if there’s a regular time they release things slated for “later this week”? I’m dying to get one of those Choya tools for the lumber glyph.
---
Lol naked. Enough said. If baseline is wearing nothing anything is possible. We are talking soldier vs berserker are we not? Pathetic.
---
I'll be honest, I can't remember the last time I was in Hoelbrak. It's good that they're making use of these other capitals that get nothing. It could also be story related, it's not a traditional holiday after all.
---
Uhm hey Anet, why is the outfit not in the Black Lion Voucher Dealer..?
---
Oof, no pity. I agree, though, sadly.
---
I play quite a bit and continually run out of karma.  Cause, you know, I actually use it for things.
---
To be honest I just want to believe we're going, I really liked this campaign and since the last episode kinda felt like a nice closure to the desert/kralk journey, it feels like we're going to start something new, could be Cantha. Would be neat. Ofc the link is weak af, but at this point I'll take any.
---
So angry man. I get where you are coming from but your anger detracts from your point and (to me) makes you look like a whiney entitled cry baby. 250g is alot from a good number of gw2 players just like 250 of 6 map currency's is alot for some gw2 players. Grinding any activity that you dont enjoy sucks. My advice to you (could be totally wrong here) is to put less importance on getting that mount asap. Imo rushing and grinding things out in gw2 (any game really) is the fastest way to make you hate the game and get burnt out.
---
Counterpoint, Mordrem Snipers.
---
These mofos will pick you out and just SIT THERE, and unless you have on-hand CC, stealth does NOTHING to stop several in a crowd of mordrem from picking you off.
---
For straight up karma, got so s4 maps and use unbound magic to purchase the karma bonus in a map and farm it.  At top tier you will get a drop that gives 200 karma.  Faster gains than any other method to my knowledge.   If you need obby shards either do SW or berry farm (if you have a few level 80s then both is viable.).
---
Whether it's "worth" buying has to be up to your personal preferences, weighed against your current financial situation, etc.  But in terms of content, the content in HoT is still very valid, and very active. 
---
The four maps play host to very popular meta events, that are fairly rewarding.  It will unlock the ability to get HoT stats on your gear; the highlights here are Viper's stats, which is meta for most condition damage focused builds, and Minstrel's stats, which are common for a number of support builds.  It's required if you want to experience Living Story Season 3, which includes several nice maps, with good rewards of their own.  It has an elite spec (powerful trait line that significantly alters a class' core mechanic, and let's them use a new weapon) for every class; PoF has elite specs too, but owning HoT gives you more options. Guild Wars 2 isn't like a lot of MMOs; old content isn't totally invalidated with every new release.  
---
One final thought: if what I've said above has convinced you to buy HoT, you might still want to wait a bit. Most, if not all, of the expansion's features are only available once you hit level 80.  Since you're only level 40, it'll be a bit before you can use the purchase.  The game's anniversary is coming up in August, and there's a good chance it'll go on sale then.  If you hit 80 in the meantime (which, admittedly, is pretty likely if you play even semi-regularly) PoF has a ton of content to keep you busy.  Just something to consider.
---
It's not an annual festival though, unless we end up defeating another dragon by this time next year.
---
me and the other thieves laugh at you behind your back
---
Yeah, probably :/
---
I was on my computer , I do have Apollo but not the pro version unfortunately
---
Drifting just slows you down, unless you have to do a hard right angle or greater turn it's not necessary, which is why many miss this skill entirely. I've found watching Mr. T's vids ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttqfQiSDH\_4&amp;list=PL\_v7kSkp8yzsMFkvUPSPDz1VHTf4BlI6t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttqfQiSDH_4&amp;list=PL_v7kSkp8yzsMFkvUPSPDz1VHTf4BlI6t)) taught me a lot about drifting and the fun it brings.
---
(Shhhhhh) Whispers....
---
“Kuunavang”
---
I can buy every item in that bundle separately...
---
&gt;rytlock who said that she could become a threat
---
no that isn't how that works, rangers just have a lot of self stacking buffs, Sic 'em(40%) and Attack of Opportunity(from Maul)(50%) and Remorseless(25%) are the biggest
---
I don't know anything about overwatch but this is great!
---
Drifting just slows you down, unless you have to do a hard right angle or greater turn it's not necessary, which is why many miss this skill entirely. I love drifting and use it in almost all of my guildhall beetle track videos ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttqfQiSDH\_4&amp;list=PL\_v7kSkp8yzsMFkvUPSPDz1VHTf4BlI6t](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ttqfQiSDH_4&amp;list=PL_v7kSkp8yzsMFkvUPSPDz1VHTf4BlI6t)) It's quite fun once you get the hang of it.
---
its been 6 years, you're confusing this with something else.
---
Thanks for the info. Last time I was playing I remembered people being weary to use gw2hook because it was technically "bannable" to modify the game, but it seems to be a bit more widely accepted now. I'll have to look into plugins.
---
The whales say: you're welcome!
---
Damn, I didn't know that they had that kind of assassination power.  
---
Well, at least I got the benefit of learning something new while also experiencing the random downvote culture I've seen people talk about!
---
With the Mist Stranger outfit coming out, it could be nice to see a developpment around it, maybe a new character bringing a new threat along. Either as an ally or a foe.
---
Bloodlegion homelands could be nice as well. However I feel like if we were to shed light on a less represented race, Id give some prime time to the Norns. Maybe the hosting of DB im Hoelbrak could be a nice way into it. Also, whatever happened to Zojja after HoT, however I think they said that the lack of Zojja had to do with the voice actor.
---
I can't wait to know what direction the new LS will take.
---
Surely if the raid release cadence was the issue then the other 9 people in your static would also stop raiding until the next wing release and your spot would be safe?
---
Although, maybe.
---
They look far too preachy to be angels.
---
Maybe she'd be happier with Dragon Smash instead. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
 This is the 3rd Griffy course i've made. I find this one to be hard as  i've messed up quite alot while running the course. But after some time  &amp; practice and removal of some things I've been able to master it!  (even though it was I who built it) :D  
---
I've included a blooper reel this time around to show you that i'm just  like the rest of you and make mistakes too, (plenty of mistakes) :D but i  just find this sort of thing super fun! Often when i pop back into the  guild hall i'll ride around the beetle track or do one of these  activities before i leave.
---
You know what else looks freaking awesome?
---
The massive disappointment is they don’t make these armors into individual pieces.
---
A better screenshot?
---
Gen 2.5 legendaries (exordium being the latest) are the most expensive ones, but they don't have collections and you can theoretically make them as soon as the patch comes if you have the mats.
---
Gen 1 (like Twilight) and gen 2 have collections, so if you're looking for a "journey" whilst making it, then that's for you. They're generally cheaper than gen 2.5, but the precursors are usually cheaper to buy outright than to craft.
---
Just plug the legendary that you want in gw2efficiency.com and it'll show you the exact costs of everything.
---
I still have stacks and stacks of zhaitaffy in my bank. XD
---
You're god damn right.
---
The standard endure pain is 4 seconds and the automatic one from the Defense tree is also 4 seconds. It looks like a visual bug since it isn't doing any damage to the rams.
---
It works with my guild because our comp we're designed to play melee, whereas most guilds now use heralds and scourges to have ranged wars of attrition. 
---
The best way to function in ranged types of groups is to sit on the side and look for a good opportunity to rush in and either get a nasty bubble off or a few really good arc dividers if you're playing Berserker. Then after you've had your fill you've got 8 seconds to gtfo; 12 if you run Defiant Stance as your heal skill.
---
Hahahaha okay
---
the flat 1000 is the ascended weapon strength.
---
To indicate that the information was incorrect, and with enough downvotes, to hide it from view.
---
It's a bot, it's not going to get upset. The downvotes were purely to help others realize that this information was likely wrong.
---
The story started even before that IIRC (if an Anet employee can confirm ?).
---
Back in 2011, before the release of the game, ArenaNet presented the game at GamesCom in Germany (I was there !). The playable demo proposed to fight Tequatl.
---
Somewhere in the ArenaNet office, a guy was in charge of monitoring the demo server. And also, had to be sure that the boss spawned/despawned correctly. Obvioulsy, the job was quite boring but needed. So this guy took his guitar and created a little song.
---
This song :
---
https://soundcloud.com/arenanet/spawn-the-dragon
---
And it was good already ! From this, they decided to reuse it and created what we can see in the video you linked.
---
Thanks for the calculation! Thematically I've always liked my Ranger as a Druid, but this makes me want to at least try out SoulBeast.
---
I sorta miss kits playing exclusively holo for so long now, but honestly it's such a fun spec I think you'll enjoy it regardless. The lockout really kills any solid use of them outside of using mortar kit to counter melee builds that elixirs and some exceeds have been the go to since you can utilize them in holo mode. Either way enjoy! Engi is life
---
Karma Boosts no longer work with the consumable karma items (sips/drops/jugs, etc)
---
Spoiler tag is &gt; ! Whatever ! &lt; without the spaces, which looks like &gt;!Whatever!&lt;
---
Thanks for the information.  Do you get more bling and glitz with 2.5 gen since they are newer and made later on?
---
It's almost like people play different content and spend their karma on different stuff. Weird.
---
&gt;combined with PvE/PvP/WvW events, we'll eventually reach the Gw1-like point of constantly having some kind of event going on
---
One big step towards entering the eternal new content drought.
---
So you would personally rather play alone in the guild hall then in a group of your guild mates you mean?
---
Things like this are solo... I hope you are having a great time (alone)
---
GvG was the “big deal” community PvP event (real world prizes!) which always drew people/guild teams together...
---
It was PvP so sure it was salty, and not for everyone, but at least the guild halls meant something more then.... decoration halls and race tracks?
---
Where on the glorious race track do you ever get the feeling of being a guild “at war” (with your brothers and sisters, shoulder to shoulder... it was a special thing to do and they really lost something of the name sake there...)
---
Imho of course
---
Maybe it's your server culture?  Seems to me there are always people doing reviving after battles.
---
r/cursedcomments
---
This might be seen as a solo endeavour, something to challenge yourself, but really it's not. It's also used for a guild race - multiple peeps at once. The beetle tracks i create are great for this. 
---
Check out this \[SPUD\] video (I'm mad jelly)  :) but they do this sorta thing too. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Iunll0\_\_E](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6Iunll0__E)  
---
GW2 is about coop community aspects more then saltiness. I mean if you like salt just step into PvP or WvW there's still plenty of it. But I agree, I do wish was more GvG things especially with the guildhall arenas. They also need to be bigger and multi level. But again that's anet's decision and doesn't really have anything to do with this video :D
---
There are more ppl playing HoT than PoF. Even PoF is the newest xpack, it's content is pretty dead because of it's lack of repetetive rewarding events
---
have you not heard of wvw or something
---
&gt; h makes you instantly level 2.
---
&gt; Caution, only works with races which have interactive doors out of home instance, eg doesn't work with sylvari. Charr have shortest from home exit to starter zone
---
this game is not grindy at all. just avoid being too much involved in fashion war.
---
Oh yeah I fully agree.. even I bought a mistlock pass so they got my money
---
&gt;Your Damage is wrong, the multiplier is 1.5 in WvW. One of the few skills I have seen that is actually more in PvP/WvW modes. 
---
&gt;
---
Wow, didnt know that and wiki doesnt say anything about it! Do you remember the source? 
---
&gt;EDIT: Also, your base power in your equation is wrong. You get 2381 running base ascended zerk. Not just a flat 1000 listed in your equation. 
---
That is not wrong just not clear. The 1000 is actually the base weapon strength (axe in this case is 900-1100). In my equation X represent the power because it is unknown and I wanted to find out how much power you would need.
---
&gt;Additionally you can get well above 220% crit damage now. Base zerks gives 214% unbuffed on any class. If you add +5*13 for slot trinkets for power, 25 might stacks, and 250 ferocity from stacks on your weapon, you get up to 3556 power and 245% crit damage.
---
Yes you can but that would be inefficient compared to stacking power. I didnt do the math but it comes from another reddit post. Cant link here but look up power vs ferocity. I just assumed the guy was 220% then maxed only power.
---
&gt;Crits like that honestly aren't that out of the question. Rare, yes. But there is a reason to it happening. I got a 22k auto attack from stealth on my deadeye against a full zerk ele. My average is 15k-18k buffed against most targets.
---
Yes I didnt realize because it was the first time I had it happen on me after a couple hndred hours of playtime in WvW. Thanks for helping out!
---
At launch I main'd Mesmer for a couple years, took a break of a few more years, came back, geared up my Mesmer and finally burnt out on her. Then I got all classes to 80 but nothing really satisfies me like Mesmer does, especially in open world dailies or just goofing around. What are some of your most fun or preferred open world builds and why? I have played S/S + GS Power Chrono extensively and need to shake things up. No gear limits, she's set for all content I want to use her in I just want some ideas on other ways to play her.
---
OwO
---
I'm kind of, but not in a pessimistic way. I think the game's in a good shape, but the story seems like it's leading towards an end soon. I feel like War Eternal was supposed to be the climax of the story, what with &gt;!killing Kralk and Aurene becoming an Elder Dragon,!&lt; so afterwards was supposed to be a sort of denouement/epilogue and lead-in to GW3. Now I'm not sure if that'll still be the case or if NCSoft is going to want Anet to stick with GW2 for the time being.
---
PoF maps still use HoT masteries and gliding. Dragonfall has several updrafts and some mushrooms. I expect mount support in any upcoming expansions and living world as well as updrafts and other potential masteries.
---
Anyone else still have the holo skins from the first one? :o
---
Hasn't it been this way since a couple patches ago?
---
Good for you, we spend it on different things apparently.   It's almost like we make different choices based on personal desires/preferences.
---
I will be sure to test that!
---
As are Teq's tendrils.
---
I don’t remember anything at all from this festival, but I have both versions :)
---
Would start using hammer on my firebrand again. Eat tomes, foul fiends
---
yeah i didn't add in the food buffs though so it might go up a bit, also if you go Moment of Clarity instead of farsighted, you can make Maul or WI do 25-30k easy, but it won't be the first hit(as you need to hiltbash to proc the MoC first)
---
Nope, only the ascended fractal chests stacked.  The ascended raid chests didn't.  Guess they fixed something.
---
&gt;Rumors of those who walk in the shadowy Mists are told in whispers ...
---
Except for the people who harangue constantly about the Mist Wars in every single city. "GO TO THE MISTS!" they bellow. Again and again.
---
I can't look at your distorted voice and not think of a certain spongebob meme.. or at least an alien juggalo.
---
Living in a fisheye lens, caught in the camera eye, I have no heart to lie.  
---
I can't pretend a stranger is a long-awaited friend
---
As a Charr main, I'm unsurprised.
---
Winter's Bite has a higher coefficient in PvP game modes than it does in PvE. It's not a bug.
---
Didn't you know? Outfits are the future!
---
Crap, I didn't think about them being that close together.
---
Then again, might be nice to have this festival to pop into for a few dailies as a break after hours spent leveling older classes plus Gunbreaker and Dancer?
---
We already know this. Those people were working on side projects but that doesn’t mean that they weren’t planning to do this. I’m sure when it comes to casual content, they’d always had it planned.
---
well something went wrong last time aswell
---
[deleted]
---
Hopefully it will have a reaper glyph when it comes too!
---
&gt; To indicate that the information was incorrect
---
to be fair, information actually correct, because that literally what OP posted
---
Yep. Idk why people can't just appreciate a variety of content. Like I can't stand those dumb comics with the Asura girl, but I don't go commenting on them saying "stop posting these"
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Thread removed: Stirring up drama is not allowed.
---
Hey! I resemble this remark!
---
The thing about HoT masteries is that you just add objects to the world and let players interact with them. What Mounts have done is made the entire world smaller by letting us move faster, as well as in ways we haven't before. All new maps will have to be designed with mounts in mind, which fundamentally warps the design of the map and kind of messes up anyone who doesn't own the PoF expansion.
---
I've found that Power QB has come closest to scratching my mesmer itch, I love having the tomes to play around with on top of the base skill set and will swap from Axe MH solo to Sceptre for tagging in groups/meta's due to lack of range. Is GS tagging Mirage build pretty straight forward, talent wise? Thanks for the detailed reply.
---
Be awared! All who clowned Norns for being T H I C C will NOT be allowed in Hoelbrak.
---
Is it just me or does that head cloth look a lot like the tyrian tarot cloth?
---
Yep true
---
The chosen one
---
Phew thank god. I've been playing since release but took a break shortly before PoF, so I've just learned about this now.
---
Oversalt
---
&gt;  I don't blame "toxic elitists" for not accepting me.
---
&gt; Some are just displeased with the behaviours and manners of "elitists" and keep their distance in order to not have to deal with those guys.
---
&gt; That's exactly why I am not interested in raiding.
---
&gt; But that's not true and that's why I keep my distance from this content. It's a magnet for the ill mannered people, like PvP content.
---
Read again what you typed before please. Thank you.
---
&gt; T3 works as a filter
---
Not it doesn't. You can do T3 with absolute randoms. Without proper team composition. 
---
&gt; you learn't the mechanics in less hostile enviremen
---
You know, there is a thing called "Training raids", but if even they kick you...well, feels bad man
---
&gt; here's literally evidence of working system right in front of your face. 
---
Because what you say it not working system. It's your believe. 
---
&gt; Would be very cool if you'd stop trying to turn every word I write in ways to let me look like a frustrated dumbass. 
---
Then don't type "like a frustrated dumbass.", because that's literally what you do
---
Exactly, because lvl 1 fractals are a lot easier than most dungeons due to the old state of dungeons where enemies can 1shot you, they bug out, no telegraphs, etc.
---
It's the shrug emote, I believe.
---
Look's amazing but not a fan of the gas mask. I want to see it with the helmet. Can't wait to get home to get it and try it out! This will look good for the thief class or any class with Mad Relm weapon set for the smokey look! xD
---
You can find the build on metabattle open world section under tagging. I can't link at the moment.  
---
As for playing the build, you just generate as many clones asap and then dodge, then press 1. Keep cycling through different targets and tagging more mobs. Switch to sword/sword combo when you actually do need to do damage yourself.
---
Wtf I thought because I use mount ability 1 and then turned it automatically drifts...wow I’m officially a hardcore casual!
---
Damn, Ana looks really dope! Great work!
---
They aren't meta though, that's why I said open world ones. It's builds made for community by community. Builds that people found fun and/or effective.
---
Triple kit wvw holo, make it happen
---
All one of them? Quite the streak.
---
Serious Exo Stranger vibes.
---
I think that is huge problem who killed it 100kk times and got 1 or 2 chests in past 6y. :)
---
Yummy will be happy.
---
Or you can read them while the patch downloads and/or during loading screens.
---
Why can't they put this much effort into the actual game and game rewards...
---
can i get a list of stuff for the mercy one? so wanna use that.
---
It's exactly *one* key that changes for *three* mounts. Only two mounts if you are realistic, because Griffon's ascend is way easier to handle with S. 
---
So you have two different functions for two different mounts. Pretty similar to something we always had right? Running on land and diving underwater. Two different ways to move, two functions for the space key (plus an extra sink key, which you also can use for skyscale btw.)
---
I love it dude. Its really cool especially for ppl who love griffin.
---
It's annoying when the game is about horizontal and cosmetic progression and all the best skins are in the gemstore. It's nice that you can convert gold, but just paying gold for rewards is really uninteresting and disappointing.
---
You loose lot of damage, critchance and critdamage its really not worth it. All you gain from Boonduration is to again fill holes you created yourself...
---
In Open World especially on Dragonhunter and the likes everything dies within seconds in your cleave. Even PoF Hero Points are rather oneshot if you just use Spear into GS4, both Traps and GS2.
---
There is no use in going for Boonduration, you loose 20% of your Mainstats for nothing!
---
Thanks, I bet I'll have forgotten it again, the next time I need it ^^"
---
I love the effect, but the actual metal armor just looks too bland and dorky for me.
---
No the problem is you don't gain on boons, you just flat out loose on damage.
---
I main Guardian since release, a Dragonhunters cleave is so insane you should oneshot PoF Heropoints etc. without even swapping weapons.
---
Mobs should die so fast to a fullzerk DH you can't make use of Boonduration if you extend your Boons out of combat because the mob died through your Ults Trap initial damage.
---
All whats gonna happen is you extend fights because you most likely loose a fifth of your dps. All boons you get, a normal Dragonhunter gets as well - just he gets it on top of his fullzerk equip. The intensity does not stack and since fights for  Guards in PvE are extremely short you're best of just running max damage to keep your infight time as low as possible so you don't recieve damage at all.
---
Guardians are Glass Cannons wich excell in nuking targets, Elites and Champions alike within seconds. Boonduration does not help you if you're out of combat again.
---
Tested it this week: they drop from the events, yeah.
---
Yeah, there’s a high possibility this could lead to our characters chasing a lead on Jormag (finally!) and the next chapter in the story.
---
The boots look... crustacean. I want to boil it and see if it changes colour.
---
celebrating Christmas?
---
must be 1AD
---
Sadly it's none of these 2. The horns sound more like on a medieval market or a celebration.
---
How are these previews made? Some way of accessing all armour? What about the characters, do you guys make a new character for each costume change?
---
I think it's pretty rad. As others, I hope it will be lore relevant. 
---
I am used to MMOs with costumes, so I don't hate them that much for not being skins. I only judge the outfit by its looks, and what I see, I like.
---
Oh yikes, I see. It displays a higher quality texture in the preview thats why. I suppose it was too good to be true.
---
Looking at the players in the game I can see edgy stuff and extra effects are in demand. This has both. My opinion is that it's gonna sell well.
---
We might not get dragonball with this. It's been re-associated with the Lunar New Year lately, it'd be unlike Anet to do something like that twice a year. That, and the contrast of it being in the city sewers might be a bit off for Hoelbrak.
---
here... take my upvote mister. 
---
fuck outfits.
---
post it to r overwatch to. get that sweet karma! it's very well done ;)
---
I totally hit up that vista too
---
looks great but as said before by most people here, the fact its an outfit just ruins it completely. (slice it up into different armor pieces and I'd be way more interested in it)
---
Yayayaya, excited 🙃
---
Think I might make a few courses like this in my guildhall...just need to find the right decoration that's cheap &gt;￦&gt;
---
Don't forget the [exclusive D.Va cosplay](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/e/e4/Asura_Power_Suit01.jpg).
---
The paiiiin
---
Looks amazing! Nice work
---
Oh, I didn't know it'd been moved to a different festival! I've...missed the Lunar festival every time. XD
---
"I don't even have time to explain why I don't have time to explain."
---
*"I don't know what's about to happen, champion..."*
---
What, like there's some plot twist of a party crasher showing up, like last time?
---
Nah, the Halloween and Wintersday trailers tend to be just as simple and easy.
---
Yeah I might need to try a more bunkery spec cause right now I'm running fresh air tempest and I love it but with mostly zerk gear (and some celestial pieces cause I like being able to do a little bit of everything) I drop pretty instantly if I'm not careful
---
Is weaver required for your spec or could I feasibly run tempest with it? I like weaver just not as much as tempest
---
I felt this :(
---
You mean wintersday? That old guild wars event from December 2005?
---
They could easily be making this an annual event though, even with that as the premise for its return. After all, they didn't make a dragon bash for between HoT and S3 with the premise of "Mordremoth's death" and have that be one-time.
---
This is a lot of work for a city decorations just to be one-time. If it were one-time, I imagine they'd reuse a lot of the previous Dragonbash's resources, such as HoloShatterer instead of HoloKralk.
---
Actually... Was Joko even separated like Mad King (i mean his limbs)? What would happen in this case? Separate his head from body, place it somewhere in the mist. Done?
---
Why? Because that's when the world boss event ends.
---
Tracer looks really good :-)
---
The new one is a Shatterer head, very different from that.
---
pvp q is bugged almost daily now sadly
---
The head part is the Shatterer's head and curved horns.
---
The design is heavily inspired by Lord Odran's map of the Mists, from the pattern on the cape to the symbols on the weapons and the belt. So this might be some way of him coming back maybe ?

\*\*\*WELL DONE\*\*\*

Could it be [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDI2nLSmyxk)
---
Runes that give only defense are completely useless.
---
I found the one soul without any humor

While last year, FotFW was late July/early August, they could push it back this year and onwards to be late August to be a GW2 anniversary celebration, while Dragon Bash - like in GW1 - remains a 4th of July-timeframe celebration. Though I think I'd have preferred it as a GW1 anniversary celebration but that's me.
---
You're totally right; it would make sense the other way around. FotFW seems to worker better as a start of summer celebration thematically, and Dragon Bash for end of summer.
---
Fuck being expected to spend all those transform charges every time I want to change a character's appearance completely.
---
We don’t know that it is lore relevant
---
They know about the bug and a fix will come.  You're not alone.
---
There's "playing how you want" and then there's "playing the slightly dated build you know by heart".
---
I raid, but I just can't be bothered to stat swap my shoulders and learn a new rotation for a 600DPS increase.
---
Considering [actual devs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eTwqhZag0g) recorded the vocals it's quite a tune, I'm glad it's returned. Maybe do a larger choir recording for release? Come on Anet you know you want to bash that dragon!
---
All that makes a lot of sense. It sounds like it’ll take some practice, but I’m absolutely willing to learn.
---
just another example of why I hate outfits.  I spent money to get glove skins or helmet skins.   Let me use them with outfits already, Anet
---
Just so say some of the big fights are in Season 4, and the PoF metas were recently made more profitable so there are people doing them.
---
I understood that reference
---
If I may be so bold,
---
I sorta wasn't trying to do myself favours or argue anything. I was just hoping that if a trans person saw that comment, they'd also see someone opposed to it. And sometimes sarcasm is better than a fight, because it doesn't weigh you down as much and it's a bit agnostic to the larger arguments that are going on. You can just say, 'lame joke', and move on, without fighting every battle.
---
There are still meany elders out there.
---
In 1 A.D. it was still called Saturnalia. :p
---
Well I dont actually have DH unlocked yet, and my experience with core guard is fights tend to go south quick (mostly due to bad habbits gained from playing necro for years). My core guard is currently in rare zerk gear and slowly unlocking DH. Honestly, I'm just looking for somone to use this gear on so I can get rid of the boxes in my bank.
---
Whoa a festival that isn't in DR/LA? Sweet! About time Norn got something interesting. It's good to have more events like this.
---
[from the design, reminds me a bit of jack of blades from fable. maybe because he had some weird effects in the endfight, dunno.](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/8/81/Jack_of_blades.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20120706104703)
