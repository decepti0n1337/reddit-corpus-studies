Which can mean death ;-;
---
There seems to be some confusion about how stats work.
---

---
If you take Viper, you do *not* do as much direct damage as if you take Berserker.
---
With Berserker, you get big crits that take advantage of +damage% modifiers.
---
With Viper, your crits are medium at best. You lose Ferocity, Power, and Precision compared to Berserker so your overall power damage goes down quite a bit.
---
If it were doubled as you describe, everyone would be running hybrid already in pvp and especially pve, because it would mean you could be doing 2x as much damage.
---
Since we don't see that, we can safely assume hybrid deals similar damage to zerker builds.
---
Yeah but in wvw zergs where everyone can take a lot of damage per second, the ability to aoe heal like scrapper can would probably mean they’d still be infinitely capped at max barrier, which would be super obnoxious. You’d need a small percent healing to barrier ratio on the heal trait, like 5-10% tops.
---
i edited that literally half a min later already because it was wrong in context.  
---
whats your point?
---
cHolo benchmarks are already up and it's exactly the same with PBM, just a slightly more complicated rotation. We tried Thermal Valve a ton and the obvious conclusion is dodging for the burns is a dps loss in a skill intensive rotation.
---
Then cWeaver arrived benchid 5k more than cHolo with a much simpler rotation and like 4 different variants.
---
Nope.
---
My honest opinion: roll renegade or firebrand instead. It appears that the meta will be moving in that direction for the foreseeable future. While I’m sad that chrono is getting dumbed down and nerfed constantly, maybe anet just wants us to play firebrigade.
---
Yeah leeches suck
---
Pre nerf Orr. That shit was hardcore.
---
When the developers are design or balancing a class, they’re generally looking at the game holistically, not just raids or WvW.  I suspect the developers are trying to target power creep with their recent balance patches.  It looks like the developers have been recently targeting specific killer combos as well as build in “trade-offs” to all off the the Elite Specialisations (e.g. 20% pet damage nerf for Druids).  
---
Since raid builds (and WvW builds) tend to min max specific class mechanics, they’re probably hurt the most by these patches.  Open World and Fractal builds should be mostly unaffected by these balance patches since they tend focus more on flexibility (e.g. condition removal, break bar damage).  
---
As a side note, when it comes to balance threads or class discussions, I’ve noticed people tend to focus specifically on raids and WvW.  You don’t really see much discussion that looks at the classes holistically on reddit.  I recently saw a few threads with new player asking for help with their first character builds.  Most of the build suggestions in these threads were generally raid builds that would be really bad for first time players doing open world content and story mode.  For example DPS builds with no condition removal or break bar damage.  I honestly don’t think it’s possible to beat the HoT story without condition removal.
---
I used to like engi ... then ANet messed up my grenades :/
---
Yup.

And mordy, and then we realized it was screwing the whole world up.

He is a very average player who holds other people to a much higher standard than he himself can ever perform. Plus his voice is super annoying and whiny.
---
"I've got VITV I have!".
---
Of the two I'd start with necro for ease of play. That said you are likely to change your main as you get to know the game.
---
Start with necro. If you get tired of it try different weapons. If it still doesn't do it for you try a class that you saw while leveling that looked fun.
---
Front loading boons is clearly something they were trying to address. Why else would they have made this change, knowing full well how much people clamored for illusionary persona to be baseline, if they didn't know the consequences of it? Obviously losing condi cleanse without clones up is a bit of a hit for boon chrono but it's also not the "huge boost" you claimed it to be. 
---
&gt; when you can barely tag shit to begin with and every other combat ends  with a 30 second condi or snare and you have to hunt down another mob  just to spawn a clone so you can shatter again. 
---
I mean tagging shit has been a problem for mesmer since launch. Did losing cloneless shatters impact that? Sure. Does that warrant all the doom and gloom over chrono? It really shouldn't. If you're that concerned about tagging things, consider taking mantra of pain. Also you could just shatter right before killing the enemy that snared you. If you have no other targets in sight and your enemy is already dead, what does it matter that you're snared for an extra 2 or 3s? It's an annoyance sure, but hardly a dealbreaker.
---
&gt;Without those things, you're better off spec'ing to a mirage for  everything except for coordinated content for groups that couldn't get a  firebrigade ready, or needs a tank. 
---
Except it's really not that bad. Chrono historically has been the strongest class at support while simultaneously providing utility. Providing both quickness and alacrity is a huge asset because it means you only have to dedicate 1 person to providing those boons and allows for flexibility for the spot of an additional support. Chronomancers are still completely necessary in raids and although they've fallen off in popularity in fractals, they're still a completely viable choice despite not being optimal. Contrary to what you might believe, they're not out to get you here with the changes they've made to chrono. They're trying to tone down the capabilities of a class that is and historically has been capable of a lot. I don't disagree that support chrono will feel less fun to play but less fun does not equal not fun at all. I still have fun playing power chrono and I still have fun playing support chrono here and there.
---
When [Hg] was a guild, their application stated that if you killed less than 20 bosses a week, it probably wasn't the guild for, at the time we had 9 different raid bosses.
---
Wow getting downvoted for not knowing. Jesus this community. 
---
And to continue our conversation. That is so dumb the whole premise of Guildwars 2 was to stop the dragons. Now they are deciding to just change the story midway. Anet needs to fire that shit head.

Any tips for heal FB for fractals? I play FB for PvP and WvW but for some reason have trouble transitioning the class for fractals :(
---
Hi :)  
---
There shouldn't be anything funny going on with the right pad in this config.    It is simply a mouse that changes to a DPAD when you click it.   The video explains whats going on with that starting around 6:00 min into it.   
---
Basically, underneath the mouse is a DPAD which has some extra bindings depending on which part of the pad you click.   Clicking the bottom or the left will hit the "F" key to interact.   Clicking on the top toggles action camera.   The right hits the ESC key.   Finally, if you click in the center it will send the "Z" button, which you will want to bind in game to "swim down".   
---
Let me know what you think later when you've tried it out :)   Cheers
---
&gt;And while one would think that the dragon would be more vulnerable while in a pre-awakened state, apparently it's much harder to find them, approach them and fight them while they are like that.
---
Probably the same thing that happened with Kralkatorrik in the Dragonfall meta, he cocooned himself with massive layers of ice.
---
Lord Faren, L+F=E :D
---
'The AFK boss'
---
I join the group and block the commander. Then I don't see their sell posts anymore.
---
He was standing by the free for all pit talking about how great he is while getting basic information wrong. Had a match against him months ago, 3v1ed then claimed his greatness. Guys a punk/troll, ignore him
---
"If it could hurt Jormag" Fixed that for you. Each Elder Dragon had ONE unique weakness. There's no one silver bullet for all of them (except the Commander's Plot Armor of course).
---
So, you are relearning how to press f4  instead of f5 and how to not do noncombat prestacking in these barely existent cases you would ever do it in raids?
---
Sometimes I feels like most of the memes on this subredit (including "relearning chrono" one) are perpetuated by bots that don't understand what they are saying.
---
That's fair. I just meant that the big boss format is one of the most overused story points imo. And I realize that basically the entire Kralk arc is exactly the same thing (aside from having Aurene on our side as an Elder dragon now, which itself is a rehash of kormir and abaddon).
---
and people bitching about people bitching about stuff
---
when all else fails, switch to personal attacks I guess. Do you have any more valuable insights to share?
---
Was already maining firebrand/aligade in fractals, will have to wait till more people ask for firebrand in raiding then thx ^^
---
MMOs right now are WoW -&gt; FF14 -&gt; ESO -&gt; GW2   
---
Anet has to go really far to push GW2 even over ESO because ESO is pay to play and still has more people than GW2 which has a f2p model.   
---
FF14 lately skyrocketed with WoW, GW2 and ESO people moving to it.   
---
Most of GW2 hardcore scene already move to it so there's no way to pass that, sorry.
---
late but i like your style
---
^btw ^warrior ^or ^guardian
---
pretty much this, it's actually true right now.
---
It's not a slog in that I can't handle the combat. I understand what you are saying about it being high level and end game. I have played through all my story and all of the Central Tyria maps are at 100%.
---
I guess what I am saying is at certain times on both of these maps if feels like aggro mobs are there just to fill a space. And for me and for my friend this can make both feel grindy at times. It's not about not being able to kill the mobs, rather that even though combat is THE core of GW2 (and obviously something I enjoy) it would be nice for the devs to stretch their imaginations a little past constant aggro mobs.
---
Should these maps be less challenging? No, I don't think so. I just get what OP is saying and I feel the same at times. Something other than constant aggro would be nice every once in a while is all.
---
There are very few fights where double chrono is actually better (largos being the main example) so pretty much everywhere you can't run boon thief you want FB/Ren/Chrono still. But yes, it can take a while for pugs to catch up and it's still going to be harder to find an FB *and* a Ren instead of just one chrono.

Okay buddy.
---
GW2 underwater raid boss..... yeh sry if that ever came true it would be madness
---
Well technically speaking it is possible to over power any of them &amp; their defenses.
---
The problem is the amount of power required to do so.
---
His bow after using the scroll for instance was capable of hurting it.
---
Though kind of the same way a butter knife could be used to hurt a grizzly bear.
---
You are technically "hurting" it and will make it bleed but f if its actually going to be useful for killing it.
---
Eh heal scrapper is already damn hard to kill so I don't think they need it.
---
It would be nice for condi however to be able to make use of it.
---
Nice.
---
So what youre saying is not putting any earnable mount skins in content and instead only selling them has successfully paid off for anet from a business standpoint?
---
The end is nigh quick run to another mmo.
---
Condi Chrono is actually benching higher than Condi Weaver from what I'm hearing. I haven't looked into it yet though.
---
They're not super distinct though. War/engi, rev/ele, and ranger/necro are pretty close.
---
Idk who told you that Revenant was weak, but they're severely wrong.
---
There was a patch just a few days ago, so some of this is bound to change, but prior to the very recent patch Herald was widely regarded as one of the most broken PvP specs, Renegade is both a super solid support and high DPS (both depend on your build), Herald is a super-strong zerg spec since the hammer offers tons of AoE ranged damage and CC.
---
Good explanation.
---
You don't need to be perfectly meta in raids, especially with something like a tank. Scrapper tank sounds like fun.
---
... that was 4 years ago... in 2015.
---
I see pugs as a way to get familiar with the bottom end of a class potential.  Some classes adapt better in less than ideal scenarios. Every run being smooth can get boring and repetitive after a while. Pugging can be fun.
---
You talk a lot about misinformation for someone who doesn't understand the difference between "can" and "should".
---
Nice
---
..Also assuming that everyone's an mmo-hopper. How thoughtful of you.
---
I love my open world Druid, too. It has such satisfying abilities, and it heals and CC's like a monster with the proper build.
---
Revenant is amazing in WvW, in fact it’s pretty meta. It can roam or zerg. And fun as hell. Not underpowered in the slightest.
---
Steam controller + steam link app on phone works so well when I can't be near my PC. Thanks for the config OP
---
Nightmare Tower was hella fun.  Marionette fight was well liked by the population. There were some truly bad episodes too, don't get me wrong, but there was some very  engaging gameplay in between, I particularly liked Escape from Lion's Arch.
---
I think a lot of Signets are named for their active skill more so than their passive.
---
A Reaper could use the active before entering the shroud I suppose, I think life siphons still work in shroud. But I don’t think you’ll heal back much anyway.
---
Good QoL tip, thanks
---
Oh no, a mindless dps drone dieing to mundane mechanics less. What a loss.
---
*NOT MY PET* in Norn female voice gets me everytime. He maybe a floaty round plant who can call down thunder, but he's my floaty round plant who can call down thunder spiritsdammnit.
---
It’s all about keeping your eyes on the tag. That’s what matters more than anything, a dead man does no damage, don’t go chase that weaver over there that you’re so sure you can kill real quick and then hop back on tag. Literally stay on tag at all times. From there tab targeting constantly and use your keybinds to be able
---
to fight without your eyes needing to leave the commander. Join discord or team speak, most commanders will literally tell you what to do in order to stay with them.
---
Imagine that. Mobs to kill in an mmo.
---
Gw2 is the only game/mmo that offers unique races, and not just the visual part but also the animations, movement, idling, jumping, running, everything is animated so in depth, I can live with the shitty armor fit as a downside, it's the outfits I can't stand but that's another discussion.
---
Talking about animation, feel, sound. Not damage.
---
If only there was pet interaction, even if aesthetic or like some NPC dialogues that trigger for rangers only and acknowledge the existence of the pet, I would die a happy guy, because it really bugs me that no one acknowledges the Alpine Wolf, the good boi who followed his master to a mindscape to literally bite chunks off an elder dragon or the tiger who selflessly went fought the God Of War and Fire just to keep his master and her dragon friend safe or perhaps that brave Polar Bear who followed her master to the darn underworld and back, literally, after the God of War killed them. And then there was the Smokescale who followed his master into the belly of a crystal dragon. Pets are friend, not minions.
---
It's fun sometimes, if you don't get retarded brainlets
---
i usually love cats, but when the cats start a fucking war and azctually destroy your country, not so much.
---
I agree, tried playing condi ele for years now but right now it's a blast.
---
One thing still bothers me:
---
Imagine a thief with fire traps that dont inflict burn, think of a ranger with flame arrows only doing phys dmg, firebrand without the brand and what about a sun spirit that has no burn on it? 
---
Sounds silly? Yes it does, still ele, the absolut master of fire got FIREBALL, patches of lava and even fire fields that only do phys dmg and no burning at all. Yes, the skill fireball does no burn. That fells so entirely wrong to me...
---
Fair enough, I guess for the most part I havent had too many issues. I'm going to have to start paying attention to how many times I fail lol
---
Wonder if I just get lucky with my hits because the initial long bow burst often forces people to use their heals to sustain.
---
I play PvE and my main is a holo condi dps. I've been playing for a whole but I'm just now starting to dig into the combat meta so i can be more useful in fractals. Condi dps got nuked and I'm still getting used to the changes. I was about to try scrapper healer because I like healing in FPSs. Is scrapper healer fucked now? Is it or Holo worth running for anything remotely serious?
---
best way to do map completion imo
---
I don't think removing the hunch wouldn't really fix the issues you have. SE tried solving their issue of having to make armor fit one race a specific way from XI to XIV by making Roe even more human looking, but a lot of armor still look like shit on them.
---
Granted, SE is definitely more lazy in this regard, cause Anet clearly makes a lot more work for themselves with Charr and Asurans, and I think they do a really good job with it. So I'm sure they would do it better than SE, but you would have to remove a lot more than just the hunch to get armor to fit the same as they do on human. Like with Norn, they are just different enough that things still just look goofy on them.
---
Personally, I like the Charr. I think heavy armor generally looks best on them, and for medium and light, while I think less works well on them, I think what does work well works better than other races. I like that they are different. I like that Anet put in this tremendous amount of effort to make them work. They didn't take shortcuts that other companies generally take so animations and armor don't have to be as modified to work on them. The race being so different means some things will look worse, but I think it's still better this way.
---
My only issue is the helmets. Most of them look like shit due to their necks, but again, I think the right ones still look best.
---
I can point to numerous posts on reddit in the last couple of months where theorycrafters and prominent players have argued against easy modes because it is a "waste of resources", with no sense of how ironic that statement is given CMs.
---
While Anet are the ones that would need to implement any changes, there are lots of people on this subreddit and in larger Discords that are vehemently against variable difficulties. It isn't a matter of pretending and suggesting I'm doing that makes it clear you aren't keeping up to speed with the wider discussion.
---
This is one of the best commissions I've seen, and really suits the style of GW, shame you cant remember the author.
---
Is condi weaver a thing right now?
---
What is it, anyhow? 10 kegs per person?
---
TBH, the scrapper build is really strong at cleansing conditions.  It's basically the anti-corruption meta.
---
Asuras are ugly as fuck. Have yet so see one that doesn‘t look like a missformed result of a shark and a rat breeding
---
Thanks, this is what I needed!
---
Go to Queensdale, there's plenty noobs and people waiting for them there.
---
This is so utly pls don‘t put that in my gane
---
Dunked it pretty hard in fractals but hybrid boon spam probably survives - arguably there's less annoying boon support classes in fractals than Chrono now though.
---
Gneiss
---
Looking For Group tab should be reserved for sellers.
---
&gt; I mean, they are not completely wrong :p. A lot of small details come down specific Fractal knowledge 
---
As a druid, I totally get what they mean :p Fortunately I'm very experienced with T4 both as dps and healer, my roadblock right now is not being familiar with FB enough to swap stuff around. 
---
Since I pug, I won't expect to have a Renegade most of the time. I have seen godlike support FB carry teams without breaking a sweat and I want in on that XD
---
Thanks for the link and really appreciate the explanation! I'm definitely gonna give it a go later. Low tier fractals and Recs beware, noob FB is coming xD
---
With payable monthly fee most ppl will stop.
---
Godsofpvp.net is the place to be for sPvP. Always updated and only the top meta builds. If you like to see some more/other builds, metabattle is my second choise.
---
It can be fix in 6 month yeah
---
Agreed, you can reliably camp GS for most openworld content and maybe T1 fractals, any harder PvE content will probably require you to learn your dps rotation or you'll get kicked for such low dps numbers.
---
Race doesn't matter. There are no special bonuses for races. Each one has same stats. Only difference is in initial story (1-30lvl) and racial skills whose are mostly useless.
---
Class — depends on how do you want to play. If you want easy and not overwhelming class to learn the game basics - choose necromancer, ranger, warrior or guardian. But if you want to play specific class (like mesmer, engineer, elementalist, revenant or thief) — choose what make you feel the best.
---
To be honest — you don't need crafting. It's good to have maxed crafting if you want to go into ascended gear (which is only 5% better than exotic, and ascended gear is used for fractals and raids). No need to worry about it now. After 4 years of playing I use crafting only to make mithril ingots from mithril ore when my storage is full.
---
I would go to the 80 lvl and then start making gold. Of course you can mine some iron or platinum, chop some trees, but the best sources of gold are in end game (fractals of the mists, farming in LS4 maps, meta events in HoT, PoF).
---
Lmao I can definitely see that.
---
Yeah its crazy!

Necro with minions spamming the GS AoE skill every X seconds or so and never moving or doing anything else for hours on end are characters controlled by a bot for easy farming.

Looks like your Skyscale got fever xD
---
I’m not crying, you’re crying!
---
Love this, game me the warm feels.
---
I don't know, you cherry pick on my comments so I won't bother.
---
I'll keep an eye out on this thread. I am also curious. I don't have my mount yet but I might be getting it soon, the hardest part has been done and it took me a whole day of running around doing events and participating in at least 3 Meta T\_T
---
I thought it utilized Diviner gear :o ? Might be wrong though, i only play the FB of the Firebrigade
---
wow I had no idea and Ive been playing since Beta. I really need to upgrade my potato.
---
Well, it's the other way around, looking only at what's "optimal" doesn't count.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
There are many viable ways of doing things. Yes, maybe "your main and favourite class" isn't featured on discrtize or snowcrows anymore. Too bad for you if it's the only thing that you care about.
---
See it as an opportunity to try new things out, if you only want to play the best, but that's just being a [meta-slave](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=metaslave). Many competitive games have balance teams that don't aim at achieving perfect equality between all options, but that purposefully shake the meta to give a fresh breath of air to the game.
---
I would have to agree with heavy armor on Charr it looks great for the most part my main gripe is that leaves medium and light looking not so great. An idea would be to add a cultural armor once or twice a season that aren't cash shop related, but that seems like very wishful thinking.
---
You also have Perfect Inscriptions despite having 0 signets

No I don't D:
---
When I'm doing mapcomp I regularly give out small gifts (couple of dyes or whatever) to super low ap accounts with a nice message. It breaks up the monotony + new player hype is some of the best. Trying to not 1 shot everything so they get participation is harder though
---
I was just about to say Kralk constructs a carapace that is difficult to penetrate
---
Just throw random messages in say chat, compliment their armor, or whatever. I got good talk and game recently with quite new person that just randomly sent me some food because I was running without any (what a silly thing to do right!), even though I was just messing around exploring (food is good only for kill exp)
---
For the record, I've often defended the position that ele builds need to have higher dps to offset their drawbacks. *However,* this applies to builds actually having noticeable drawbacks, like having to pre-place a conjure so you can pick it up \~25 seconds later. Or having your single biggest dps skill root you in place and get interrupted by random stuff because your party has 0 stab uptime.
---
Current condi builds are clearly overpowered. I only hope they address this properly instead of nerfing traitlines left and right. Internal class balance is better than it has been for quite some time right now. Water/Air, Air/Fire and Fire/Water are all valid power dps combinations for different weapons and builds. It would be really sad if we go back to "2 usable lines + elite spec".
---
Condi renegade is consistently benching above 35k for months now, though. Capping damage output regardless of build complexity is poor design. Not that I'm defending condi ele builds here, they're clearly overpowered.
---
Campfire staff is pre-HoT. Staff Tempest was fun to play, especially its Fresh Air variant. And so was Staff Weaver. I miss them all.
---
What the Skyscale did for me was tire me out from grinding this game and get me to play a more rewarding game.
---
Yup and raids are a hit or miss, you'll either find a nice and chill group that knows what they are doing or.... the exact opposite. It's very hard to find something in between.
---
I vote for the thief as well. I dislike weapon switching because it breaks immersion -&gt; thief camps weapon sets. Also like xDnatt said the thief is not about managing a rotation of cooldowns rather than managing your resource. This means less focus spent on the skill bar and more on the actual gameplay.
---
They have no clue what to do with scrapper. 
---
The weapon suggests tanking, the gyros (at least 4 of them) and their toolbelts suggests support, and the traits they try to make suggest damage (although it is weaker than before).
---
A small thing that bothers me as well is we have stuff like experts examination (the trait that no build ever uses) is considered fine and left unchanged while build vital stuff like rapid regeneration (the only synergy the scrapper has with a healing build) got straight up removed. 
---
Also there's a massive bloat of super speed traits (while super speed is worth less without rapid regen) as if that's the only thing they agreed scrapper should be truly excelling at. To bad super speed doesn't stack, but instead overwrites. I mean we got a adept trait (already providing all the super speed you would ever need), then a minor to overwrite that, then a grandmaster overwriting as well. 
---
And a lot of damage modifiers disappeared for those who actually like glass scrapper.  
---
As for the function gyro it feels like the turret nerf. No, not that one. Not that one either... The final one where they buffed turrets in raids by removing controlled overcharge to buff raid engi dps why a massive 200 or something, at the cost of massively nerfing turrets like rocket turret (only overcharge on placement as opposed to every 20 sec). They realized scrappers never got to use their primary mechanic in pve so now it is a button you can press for some rather minor effects given the cooldown. At the cost of elite toolbelts, and a longer cooldown. Some even suspect a hp reduce on the gyros which would not surprise me the slightest when it comes to this sledgehammer golf approach to balance.
---
u can afk anywhere in core tyria/hot areas with it
---
The inbetween is where people don't really talk.
---
The problem is when people start forming arguments or feedback based on how things feel instead of facts like numbers (though I disagree with the OP's reading of the stats which I broke down in another comment), the arguments and feedback risk becoming unconstructive and/or unfeasible.
---
There is no difference in products between NA and EU. It only matters when you choose a server(NA/EU) after buying one of them.
---
That's where all old Oaktrees Vets go and live their final moments before becoming a part of nature.
---
the silverwaste relics and gold relics is a good example i think. i did it with griffon but i imagine skyscale is reallly good for it. rock collector too as someone else suggiested but it’s just really good for collecting in general. i don’t have skyscale yet but i think its also good for gathering materials in general for example the tree top flax in tangled depths.
---
Now this is what all shitposts should aspire to be hehe.

Thats a new concept for me. Does it replace ore for other mats or is it ore for other ore? :S
---
Take my upvote for the one insightful comment I've found in this long slew of vitriol.
---
This aggravates me to no end. They keep promoting people like Tekkit's Workshop (no offense to Tekkit and its viewers) which has 12k subscribers but virtually never mentions Teapot who has 16k subscribers, Fornax from the Herald has 19k, Aurorapeachy who has 29k, and Wooden Potatoes who only gets the occasional shoutout on Guild Chat has 137 freaking thousand subscribers.
---
I.DON'[T.GET.IT](https://T.GET.IT).
---
I just recently started watching Teapot's videos and it's criminal how someone so rational and insightful doesn't get more exposure. Everytime he proffers a guess as to why something in GW2 is not being done or done well, I just nod my head furiously because I experience those same difficulties at work when we have to scale back development for an unpopular feature or dying game. 
---
This guy is remarkably in tune with game development difficulties despite not being in development himself and I really wish everyone in the community could be like him.
---
It makes map completing HoT super fun
---
Good God are you a jaded, cynical bastard. Thank God we got you here fighting the good fight against evil Anet exploiting their willing mindless drones for easy moneyz.

Nothing delusional about that.

Ok, reality check. If you claim to know games aren't charities, then please know an F2P title isn't relying on anything but the best way to earn money. If you disagree with how an F2P title monetizes, please spend your money on the method you agree with. And get your friends to do the same. Publishers don't read the forums, they read the balance sheets.
---
If tomorrow, nobody spends on the random mount license and everyone buys only the selector mount license, I guaran-damn-tee you ArenaNet will change the way it sells the next set of mount skins. Ditto for Black Lion Keys and chests.
---
Personally this, i just bother with the leatherworking glyph on platinum nodes and then swap characters and repeat, rest is not worth my time tbh.
---
Take it to Tangled Depths if you haven't finished it, or do it anyways cause skyscale in HoT zones is awesome.
---
I died last night and a lvl 80 character was near by. He came over and fought the mob that killed me then went on to res me to 90 per cent and walked off haha
---
And riding the skyscale!
---
Fresh people's opinion is more valid than that of burned out, jaded veterans that hang around a game they don't enjoy anymore, spewing cynical bullshit every chance they get.
---
Those people have a clear and untarnished few on what's important: having fun.
---
Everyone with 20k hours complaining that there is nothing to do and that he's already done everything needs his head checked out.
---
Gw2 comm is the same community as in other games, can we please finally stop this madness. The game just gives you less opportunities to be a jerk. Which is incredibly good game design. Credit is due to Anet, not to the community.
---
Preach it!
---
I basically ignore those who have no better arguments except predict doom when the game doesn't develop in the direction they like. I see " And once X happens, Y will leave and the game dies.", I just skip to the next comment.
---
Thank you so much for this!
---
SO I've looked up various builds and the most popular one I've found is the [spirit-Druid build for Raids](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Druid_-_Boon_Support_Healer) which actually looks a lot simpler than I'd first thought (I always assumed healing + boons was incredibly hard...) though it's a long guide.
---
I think the reason I haven't ran Druid before is I usually try things in open world and never really found a way to try it by myself. How do you effectively trial out a healing build without going straight into a raid?
---
Still here, though.
---
Haven't played in a while but I had a day of great fun with someone who had just started. They were asking for help in map chat, I offered to lend a hand with one heart quest and ended up following them through their story and helping them complete Queensdale. I even caught up with them a few weeks later to run them through their first dungeon, showing them how it's done, offering advice on builds and different classes.
---
Pardon me for this odd question but would the gear for the alacrene you posted here be the same if it's for raids?
---
I think "malcontents" is a very appropriate term to describe those in the community whose expectations don't align with reality.
---
I call bullshit. GW2 has no battleaxe.
---
\*End sarcasm\*
---
Really, give us that battleaxe.
---
This is precisely the reason why leveling has to be challenging. These kinds of moments are why I absolutely love mmos but they sadly happen way to infrequently because it's too easy.
---
You know, between this and the other post about whether GW2 is dying, and knowing ArenaNet has a strong social justice culture, I'm beginning to think besides metrics, another reason why they neglect Raids, PvP and WvW could be because they just don't wanna develop content for the most toxic parts of their community.
---
I am rather young so I wasn't even able to play this 9 years ago xD
---
How did you find the artist?
---
She's just recording down our deeds in the anals of history
---
Probably figured you revived and left. You can rally and come back up anyway once you're at 90÷ right?
---
We should just get Taidha's gate engineer on the pact forces. We could probably just run straight through any enemies that might pop up instead of getting our airships aggressively penetrated like we usually do.
---
I was full dead and wrote thank you in chat. It did give me a good laugh though.
---
Thank you! I chose the skinniest body type available. 
---
The armor is Heavy Houndskin Mantle, Spearmarshal chest, Foefire gloves, Heavy Corsair pants, and Heavy Corsair boots
---
The dyes are Darkness (black), blue whale (purple) and dry silver (gold)
---
This is the community in a nutshell, its great and the achievement points are a great way to spot new guys without them out right saying it.
---
Hah, remember when they told us legendary armor wouldn't clip?
---
You forget W4 @Deimos - HK
---
Basically what others have said, it's an extremely potent class with high burst in PvP/WvW, and extremely high DPS in Organized PvE when running the correct builds in each mode.
---
In fact, Revenant was so powerful in PvP last patch it just got its PvP build nerfed. Funny enough, the Condition-based DPS build in PvE actually got buffed even when it was already super strong.
---
The class offers a wide array of potent builds ranging from healing to buffing, to straight DPS and some hybrid in-between builds when it comes to PvE. As far as PvP is concerned, your builds are going to focus more on damage *avoidance*, rather than damage mitigation (evades and dodge-rolling), meaning that the better you get the class will become exponentially more powerful, all while dishing out really high damage.  
---
Good luck out there if you choose to continue playing the best class in the game.
---
I’ve never been tried fireworks because you get lots of movement speed without them but if they are way cheaper or something sure try them out. If you can afford scholar though I would get scholar. And I occasionally mix in marauader accessories/ring/amulet/backpack but I use zerker armor and weapons. Mostly I just want damage because my survivability comes from my Mesmer abilities, the extra vitality doesn’t do that much because once somebody is hitting you you’re probably gonna die anyways, whether it’s 17k or 19k HP. But marauders is still good.
---
it's so sad cause when we were starved for hot masterys I went head and completed all the story chapters master achivments all except that one for the fight and just gave up since it just bugged all the damn time
---
was about 2k hours before i got a precursor (leaf of kudzu), I've had to craft precursor for all the legendaries I actually have.
---
Over 4.5 hours here. My most expensive drop was about 100g and I've never had any really rare drop. 
---
Meanwhile my husband recently got a music box worth almost 1k gold - more than what his /age says. 
---
Neither of us have ever seen a precursor drop.
---
Also I recommend using the mirage skill  illusionary ambush, it breaks enemy targeting when they’re on you, is a teleport, and is a great “oh shit” button to help survive while you’re learning. To be honest I still use it! Especially because the power build I use doesn’t use stealth.
---
They call **mesmer clones** "profession-specific energy" on chrono now D:
---
Oh you mean the rotation, not the song
---
Or playing wvw and commander need to go offline, but no one is there to lead a defence of the map. We talked earlier about being interested at commanding in general. Dude gave me spontaneously alle the gold needed to get the book. And there i was, a noob with 35 people following my lead.
---
&gt; NSFW
---
Yeah, I've seen enough hentai to know where this is going. Does it still count as a foursome if two of them are mesmer clones?
---
If you're using the FB/Ren/Chrono comp it only needs ~20% BD because of the signet extension from the chrono which is why that comp is so much stronger than double FB/Ren. But in places where you don't have the Chrono (Matthias and MO with boon thief, anywhere with pChrono) you need almost full diviners.
---
Almost 5100 hours, no precursor and nothing else of substantial value.
---
was maybe 500-1000 hours in the game in 2013 when my roommate asked what I was doing while I was playing GW2. Showed him the game and said "here you can drop some weapons into the mystic forge to have a chance on getting a better weapon or even one you can craft into a legendary"
---
dropped 4 random yellow items in the toilet, pressed the button and got the legendary mace pre out of it. since then, 5000 hours now, not a single one.
---
I'm slowly getting into the swing of letting people see my art lol. Also I love their default skin in celestial. It's like they're seal point cats.
---
As a customer I want to be treated a certain way. I'm not going to accept shady shenanigans to get me addicted on a gambling mechanic.
---
There are fair and unfair ways to monetize a game. I just don't like what GW2 does so I move on, end of the story for me. This should be a reality check for you too I guess
---
4.1K hours - 2x precursors &amp; 1x diamond infusion... All dropped in WvW
---
Under 1k hours one kudzu pre from toilet and one dreamer pre from unidentified blues.
---
200 hours, got Dawn from Teq while farming for Sunrise. Luckiest I've ever been, though.
---
 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
4.5k hours and I have gotten 12 pre's. Strangely enough, it wasn't until middle of last year, up until a month ago, that they started dropping. Luck was MIA, then it just kinda shot up. Back to being MIA though. Various other smalls things of value outside of those. No egg sac though. That's one lottery that I will sadly never win.
---
You know it does! :-D
---
I like how they all have different expressions.
---
Giggity.
---
I wanted to test out my toon's PvE build and headed to solo HoT HPs. Found this new player who had just gotten both expansions and used the level 80 boost.
---
Poor fella had no idea about gear and how it worked. I partied up with him and helped him out through gearing and some tough HoT content for like 5 hours. It is SO much fun and it makes newer players love the game. Puts a smile on my face seeing them get better as time passes too.
---
Around 5k hours, been playing since headstart. Got my first precursor drop this spring (Leaf of Kudzu) from the AB chests.
---
No you need more Diviner Armor to get 100% Boonduration.
---
Also different food I guess...
---
Dear god, Nebezial is a gif to humanity.
---
I find it best for precision "jumps" that the springer flubs and/or bumps its head on. Also terrain with smaller hills/cliffs, as you can easily fly-dash to get over them.
---
They didn't change their mind half way. There are tons of hints in vanilla that the repercussions for killing a dragon are serious, many more in seasons 2, 3 and even Hot. Fundamentally it goes back to a mechanism set up in GW1 nughtfall: destroying a very powerful bering releases immense amounts of energy, that need to be contained or they will tear reality apart. It was abbadon back then, now it is the elder dragons. 
---
And the premise is still stopping the dragons but 1. Stopping does not have to be the same as killing. 2.if we kill them we need to have ways to contain the released energy, such as aureen.
---
Well I'm from EU, so the perspective is going to differ a bit, I suppose. I can also see why the hardcore guilds have moved on, given there's no real progression in this game's raiding that you can usually find in others, and that the difficulty of the last 2 wings was lower, meaning there's less things to challenge themselves with.
---
Other than that, I still would argue that the group inbetween hardcore raiding and training raids is by far the biggest, and atleast within that, I don't really see much difference in population from my point of view.
---
Thanks!
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ponder_the_Wytchmire
---
Go eat a tide pod kid.
---
I'm ok with that, whatever.
---
If you want to gimp yourself thats fine for me but you take ages clearing bosses and your failure margin is huge. So have fun.
---
Also I doubt you clear CMs with that, be it Fractals and Raids. Fractals pay loads of gold, 70g-80g daily within an hour that you need to clear them and I see so many people neglect that then proceeding to bitch about living story chapters are behind a paywall or the Griffon mount is too expensive. Because noone taught them properly.
---
Do yourself and your raid a favour and link them some guides.
---
You see trainingsraids does not mean what you think it means, I figured that out rather quickly in this community. You're here to train the boss, not to learn your own class. You're expected to show up with consumeables and proper equipment to train the bossmechanics. You're however *NOT* here to l2p your goddamn character. Its about playtesting this encounter and adapting / tweaking your build to have an easier time.
---
You're expected to know your own class ^lol in a trainings raid! Sadly this community is not working that way, we can't have personal effort.
---
The box that the hard copy came in is so cool looking. Mine is still at my parents' house somewhere.
---
Hours are not really a good measure for "drop rate of valuable stuff".
---
If you rarely/never use the MF, then naturally your drop rate will be lower. Similarly, if you do not do fractals, raids, or one of the bosses that drop special ascended items.
---
They made a sort of fix so that you don't have to glide at all but can stand in a bubble on the ground. It is not helping though if you are going for the achivement but outside of that i would say go for the bubble.
---
What if it's planned for the gw2 7th year birthday
---
To be fair the crafting licences allow a new slot for all characters on a an account
---
I have a 100% rate in the second category.   70+ raid attempts and the first 3 were so salty I developed a heart condition.   Only successful raids were ones I bought.... but I got a compliment from the sellers that I was surprisingly competent  which was nice.
---
r/woosh
---
better to get volatile when the tools are available.. much cheaper and you get 3 of them that way..
---
Reaping is awesome for two use cases. 
---
First - concentrated mode spots, such as elder wood spots next to Pagga and Waywarde waypoints, flax in VB and TD, Dry Top garden, etc.
---
Second - farming guild halls and home instances. I do three guild halls every day and with reaping sickle it's a breeze. Home instance farm requires a few swaps (sickle into pickaxe into axe in Rata for example) but becomes way less of a chore as well.
---
I suppose you aren't on the eu servers are you? otherwise I could help you a bit with getting going in raiding so you can at least get some of the rewards
---
Nope just game clients open while the person is doing something else while still monitoring the game
---
&gt; its a huge timesaver.
---
Maybe so, but you also lose out on something that could get you more.. like more VM.. or bounty for extra wood.. considering the nodes take an hour to respawn.. there's a huge gap with w/e to do..
---
150 dailies.  Or about 13 hours in DF farm.  Or 25% of profit from most legendary sales.  It isnt small but it's easy to build up.
---
Yes, but imagine this - raids and MF and such have guaranteed exotic in specific cases, thus you just have to roll towards *which* exotic it will be.
---
While when killing stuff normally, you first roll what quality you will loot, and then the roll what item from that category it will be. And getting exotic is still pretty rare, so you have way less rolls towards the possible loot table containing precursors.
---
The thing is you don't have to be extremely good, you just have to not suck and every raid is easy 9-man (Largos could be a problem). The bigger issue is only the organization.
---
Mounts ruined map completion. New players can't keep up with other players.
---
I can only imagine how much time it takes to craft a legendary
---
.... now you have me thinking of lines of new players pacing around like a dog pound waiting to be adopted and hordes of experienced players begging their GM to let them adopt 6 because damn it if it isnt fun being around then....  And the GM is going no, not 6.  You can get 1.
---
Then the person returns with 1... dozen. And the biggest shit eating grin.
---
I hate this meme. This scene in Heidi was so awesome.Quit ruining my childhood memories!
---
Maybe for some people. I got lucky to get enough gold from boss rush loot to finally get griffon.
---
I've gotten 2 pre's.. all underwater.. 
---
Now if you count black lion keys, I've had over 60 keys drop in the past 5 years.. since keys take up a precursor slot (I was told)..
---
For people who missed it, OP was referring to how the two characters kinda died out in the latest story installments. 
---
Probably for the best. Their character stories were botched, and the relationship between the two felt like a signal for "wokeness."
---
These comments are lame as fuck.
---
he said he wants to do fractals and raids, so I assume he wants to make ascended stuff.
---
You don't need High.
---
If Environment is set to Medium they will appear.
---
To see the details on the surface, like the eyelids, Shaders must be set to Medium or High.
---
Having Environment set to Low makes many other things disappear, like the glass viewports at the Imperator's core at the Ash and Blood Tribune offices.
---
Definitely not worth setting Environmental lower than Medium for 1-2 extra FPS.
---
Yeah, I mean do people even know what its like trying to get into a raid as a new player.
---
Errr... You can fully gear your guardian with the cost of the toosl AND you don't have to spend time gathering maybe?
---
I dropped a precursor once.  
---

It's value was more or less the same as now.
---
I've always debated saving up and getting the tag even tho I'm a noob. (Account is 2200 days old, I have like 200 hours of gameplay since I just tried the game again and am loving it) but I play alot of dead hours with no tags.
---
Scapper, full wander set (non ascended) with  vampirism runes, easy tank all PVE content, use it for farming to tag mobs and move on, was awesome on istan back in the day.
---
I dont even have trinkets on my engie scrapper, I have 21k life, never die.

kasjory &lt;3
---
Rev has always been the spec that I've felt was just incomplete without its Elite specializations. The class came out as Elite specs were coming around, so they possibly could have really built it around Herald at the time.
---
Anyway, I'd say yeah, stick it to 80. That's when the class really starts to feel complete, at least for me.
---
(also try condi sometime, it's pretty fun to bomb things with conditions on mace/axe and demon stance)
---
Those rock heads are a different thing.  They used to be all over the world here and there.   
---
Still you can see one of those rock heads in Hoelbrak, at Sigfast's Steading.  So they are still around.   
---
These are rotting trees forming the heads. Not rock heads covered by trees. 
---
I suspect they were assets for a Nightmare tree or some other boss for the swap, and they ended up using the ones we have now, but still reused the heads as decoration.
---
They should turn foefire into a GvG game mode like the first game. It’s basically one of those maps. Just have to slightly change the mechanics.
---
TBH they gutted them in the release of HoT, they're nothing more than LGBT Token characters at this point, and even then they fall into all of the clichés; two incredibly attractive women of different personalities, one tough, one sweet, fall in love.
---
WHOA!! SUCH A MASTER PIECE!
---
Over 9k hours here, i had a lot if ascened weapons and armor boxes, and if we count bl chests i got a endless bank ,and tp but never ones got a precursor drop
---
And people say dungeons are bugged. The same thing is STILL happening at Xera.
---
Map completion isn't a race.
---
I just realized why Marjory's Dagger has that seemingly pointless wiggly thing on the handle.
---
You learn every thing new every day.
---
4.x hours, got Zap (that i SALVAGED BY MISTAKE) and the 2nd most valuable thingie for fatebreaker (thats like only 200g or so? dunno if it counts).
---
But i did find the real treasure... Friendship!
---
As I said, carebear all you want, doesn't change a thing.
---
They get to see what they can work towards.
---
Some jumping puzzles (Coddler's Cove in particular) used to have issues with having critical-sight geometry disappearing, making them near impossible to finish without having the environment set to high. Not sure if it's still a problem these days though.
---
The first one is always the longest, moreso if you're making a Gen2 legendary. Also depends on how much standing capital you have lying around and how much time you spend playing "profitable" game play loops.
---
They basically buffed a large amount of traits and skills for condi that made condi builds absolutely broken. Expect this to be fixed in a few months with the next balance patch though.
---
as part of the Unofficial Mentor Program ^(tm)  I love helping people out, giving them 15 slot bags and etc. Love making people feel welcome and getting to introduce them into the game
---
I am not sad, there is still hope. 
---
What do you even need salvaged excelence for?
---
Just one minor gripe that is admittedly a tiny bit of gitgud: I wish Weave Self lasted 1-2 seconds longer.
---
GvG had many more NPCs, and the bases were more defensible.
---
But with some tweaks it should be possible.
---
Stronghold maps could also be used for GvGs, if they solve the 'turtle tactics' problem.
---
I remember watching sneak peek footage and being so excited for it.
---
Before LA was destroyed in S1, it had a second, unused, gate hub at Coriolis Plaza (where the five city gates are now). These gates were, as said, unused. They didn't go anywhere.
---
As explained on the wiki: 
---
&gt;Before the destruction of Lion's Arch by [Scarlet](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Escape_From_Lion%27s_Arch),  the original intention of the asura gates was a way of future proofing  part of the city's design. Part of the reason that the asura there  didn't have any concrete information about their destinations was  because [ArenaNet](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/ArenaNet)  didn't yet know where the story of Guild Wars 2 would go, so these  asura gates were marked as "under construction". With the start of the  development of [Living World](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_1),  there was the necessity of having them shifted as ArenaNet figured out  the content delivery strategy and asura gates didn't really play as big a  role as expected.[\[1\]](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Coriolis_Plaza#cite_note-1)

Tbh the Radiance is where most of your boons come from, that build looks ok. If you want maximum Dragon Hunter DPS I don't play DH but i'm into build craft, My friend uses this build I gave him and is a tough opponent.

---
There's two that were there, the second one - shown in the image - led to Southsun. The one leading to Fractals was hidden in a corner.
---
Anyone have a good use for the [chest of inscriptions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_Inscriptions) and [chest of insignias](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_Insignia) from CMs? Other than picking the highest value and selling it. I was hoping to be able to pick diviners and craft some dragonsblood weapons with them but for whatever reason the chests aren't updated with new stats.
---
“No title”
---
No title needed.
---
I will, in the meantime i support people in wvw as good as possible.
---
The fractal one is hidden behind a building in the OP's image; the one seen front and center led to Southsun.
---
Southsun was originally accessed via NPC on the docks, taking places to Pride Point or Lion's Point, but with Secret of Southsun update, they added a second asura gate which led to Pearl Inlet and removed the NPC.
---
&gt;no aurene chest.
---
dont mention this ever.
---
Refer to the snowcrows or metabattle builds to start. You should be running Harrier stats instead of Minstrel stats, but it's not a huge loss. You lose out on some boon duration and some damage, but hopefully you're near 100% boon duration after the fractal potion anyway.   
---
Here's a write-up I wrote a while back to supplement the SC or metabattle guides.  
---
-----------------------
---
They have a lot of utility that you need to switch around based on the encounter. Lots of decisions to make based on what you need.    
---
  
---
**Weapon Choice**  
---
In selecting weapons, you're basically always going to have Staff and off-hand Shield. The only real choice is main-hand Axe or Mace. Mace is for healing/protection/aegis while Axe is for cc/fury/pull/dmg.  
---
 **Your Tool Kit**  
---
Requirement | Skills | Traits | Weapons
---
---|---|---|----
---
Might | Mantra of Potence | Virtues - Inspired Virtue, Honor - Empowering Might | Staff 4
---
Stability | Stand Your Ground, Hallowed Ground, Tome of Courage 1/5 | Honor - Pure of Voice, Virtues - Master of Consecrations | N/A
---
Protection | Hold The Line| Honor - Pure of Voice | Mace 3, Shield 4
---
Cleanse | Mantra of Lore, Tome of Resolve 2/5, Tome of Courage 4 (actually resistance) | Firebrand - Archivist of Whispers, Firebrand - Loremaster | Staff 3/5+2 (blast finish your Light fields)
---
Aegis | Mantra of Solace | N/A | Mace 3, Shield 4
---
Fury | Feel My Wrath | Honor - Pure of Voice | Axe 2
---
Retaliation | Stand Your Ground, Hallowed Ground | Honor - Pure of Voice, Virtues - Master of Consecrations | N/A
---
CC | Bane Signet, Tome of Justice 3 | Radiance - Perfect Inscriptions, Firebrand - Unrelenting Criticism | Axe 2/3, Shield 5
---
Projectiles | Wall of Reflection, Sanctuary, Tome of Courage 3 | Firebrand - Archivist of Whispers, Virtues - Master of Consecrations | Shield 5
---
More Healing | Bow of Truth, Signet of Mercy, Tome of Resolve 5/4/3/1 | Honor - Honorable Staff, Honor - Writ of Persistence | Staff 1/2/3/4, Mace 1/2
---
Unique Buffs | Bane Signet, Tome of Resolve 5, Tome of Courage 5 | N/A | N/A
---
Quickness is not included because you should almost always run Mantra of Solace, Mantra of Potence, and Feel My Wrath.   
---
**Pre-stacking with Mistlock Singularity:**  
---
*0. Channel your mantras.*  
---
1. Feel My Wrath (Quick/Fury)  
---
2. Mantra of Solace+Potence (Quick/Might/Aegis)  
---
3. Greatsword 4 (Retal)  
---
4. (swap Greatsword with Staff) Hallowed Ground (Stab/Retal)  
---
5. Staff 2 to blast Fire field from Hallowed Ground (Might)  
---
6. Staff 3 (Swift)  
---
7. Staff 4 (Might)  
---
8. Axe 2 or Mace 2 (Fury or Regen) 
---
9. Shield 4 (Prot/Aegis)  
---
10. Bane Signet (+Power) 
---
11. Mistlock Singularity  
---
12. Run in with Tome of Justice up, casting 5/4, use 3 to break initial CC.   
---
This should start the fight with 25Might/Fury/Quickness/Protection/Retaliation/Stability/Regeneration/Swiftness/Aegis/BaneBuff. This is a very click intensive pre-stacking, it'll take practice to be able to swap skills and weapons fast enough. You can trim a lot of these steps if all you care about is Might/Fury/Quickness, or modify as necessary, such as adding in Stand Your Ground, anything from Tome of Courage or Tome of Resolve to get assortment of other useful buffs. If you add too many things to your pre-stacking then your earlier buffs are going to run out by the time you actually start the fight. 
---
**Rotation**  
---
There's no real rotation. Keep swapping back and forth between your weapon sets unless you anticipate need a particular skill.    
---
* When in staff, cast 3/4 off cool down, save 2/5 in case you need to burst heal with 2, or blast Light field with 5+2 for condi cleanse.  
---
* When in X/shield, cast 4 and 5 off cd unless you know you need to Aegis from 4 or you need CC/block projectiles with 5.
---
* If you're running axe, cast 2/3 off cd unless you know break phase is coming up. Don't cancel your auto chain.    
---
* If you're running mace, cast 2/3 off cd unless you know you need to Aegis a big hit with 3. Don't cancel your auto chain (free healing).   
---
You just have to remember where in your massive toolbox are your tools are so you can pop it in time.
---
That's it, you can't play guild wars anymore. Your time is over
---
1500 hours, and my best drop has been [Khadiri's Music Box](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Khadiri%27s_Music_Box), and that only came after they buffed the drop rate, recently. 
---
Only other noteworthy drop I've ever gotten is an Advanced Cloth Rack from a BL chest.
---
I'm pretty unlucky.
---
This is the quality shit post we deserve
---
Technically, most of the work is done. Open up the wardrobe panel and you'll find you can click on the trinkets. This function was added when they added gathering tools. But there's no skins to select.
---
Most likely reason is because of the legendary trinkets' stacking aura effect, if so then we won't see them added to the wardrobe as skins until we get that second ring.
---
Upgraded months ago but just realized that they were there! Time to go find some more haha.
---
Reminded me of this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpVhSx0fZwM&amp;ab_channel=twig) for some reason.
---
Anet could add a feature where you could add another player on the mount with you.
---
And singing “I can show you the world...”
---
&gt; considering the nodes take an hour to respawn.
---
Hijacking the comment chain but... really ?!? Those wood nodes are on a timer ? I always thought they were linked to the map and respawned only the next day/if another map was created !

Darn I love the flavour of it. I dont wanna spend and hour trying to find pugs that wont kick me though lol. So sick of heal scrapper.
---
I agree that a huge part of it is game design, but GW1 had much less of a deliberate 'discourage trolling' design and still had a way nicer community than comparable MMOs at the time, for my money. Compared to the height of WoW popularity (when I played both) it was pretty calm. GW1 was the only MMO i didn't see constant edgelord racist/homophobic slurs in, for one.
---
Yes, Arc can handle items with the same name when they have different stats.
---
They actually did explain the point of each spec in their individual twitch streams, giving them some lore.
---
Her last name is Einshorn and letters were coming from *E*, so...
---
Not sure where your downvotes are coming from. It was literally a design decision to futureproof expacs by having a portal hub in old LA that never got used.
---
He is definitively one of the best BDSM artists out there and I'm quite happy that he plays GW2.
---
She's cute!
---
What underperforming build did they need?
---
I asked for a commission drawing on the gw2 forum, arts section.
---
I really always applauded Anets trying to challenge existing conventions. However, when something works don’t try to challenge it too hard.
---
I’ve always applauded Anets challenge of status quo. I just feel sometimes they try and challenge too much.
---
We've all been there, no matter how many AP we have now lol
---
Core needed a blanket buff. Also, do you actually think about any other gamemodes than the DPS golem?
---
Unless it involves voice acting they should be able to sic an intern on this.
---
Core ele has needed buffs in every gamemode, hardly random if you think about it.
---
I've always wanted to try D/D ele in WvW! One of my more experienced guild mates runs around with it from time to time. It seems a lot of fun! Now I just wish I knew how to play it :P.
---
Along with this items can have the same name/stats and different runes/sigils or infusions and it can tell the difference.
---
Something something tentacles
---
Except for the fact that Condi Chrono is currently at a 42k benchmark.
---
And an intern can gather all of that by looking at the lore, wiki, old livestreams and meeting with the devs involved.  While these devs focus on their current projects.
---
You want to tell me that ANET doesn't have design documents that an intern can read over?
---
2.8k hours over the last 4 years, only a year ago bought about 100 exo axes, put first 4 into the mystic toilet, got Frostfang pre, two days later bought &lt;50 maces, got Energizer. Apart from that...nothing.
---
Reminder if you didn't know that he has a week long art giveaway going in conjunction with the GW2 team. It ends tomorrow.
---
Omnomnivore
---
Only now? Bah.
---
Haven't checked my time, but I have gotten a Teq weapon box and a winter's heart infusion from wintersday presents.
---
Interns are busy leading the balance teams.
---
T7 ascended materials like Lump of Mithrillium could use requiring a bit of T6 and a bit less T5.
---
Been on the internet long enough to know where that is going
---
Back when I played Rift a lot, I spent a few days using a Kinect to play entirely wirelessly. Got to where I could even PvP and raid with it (and did a decent amount of gameplay in GW2 as well but all solo PVE). It was awkward at first but the more you do it, the more natural it feels. I assume the same would go for that.
---
I'm genuinely convinced that S5 is going to be a make or break. The fact that they had no idea if there's going to be a S5 right up until they had to create the final cutscene really rings all kinds of alarms in my head.
---
Either they deliver 'an expansion's worth of features' (and content) with the next season, or they'll decline sharply.
---
Kinky.
---
When did they nerf afking in POF areas?
---
One of the perks of dating a mesmer.
---
Games like these take a year or two off my life every single time.
---
I wish I had taken time to appreciate the default skin. I literally went from "oh, it's mine now?" to dropping $20 on the five pack of skins while I was till hovering in the last rift.
---
Excuse me?
---
I did the first lab with a guy and he helped me a lot, gave me some tips and tricks and also gave me some boosters as well as 4x 18 slots 
---
And it was 1 am
---
So cool

Omg, he nailed it... once more!
---
Not enough words for telling how damn good is Stjepan Sejic, not only writting great stories (Death Vigil, Sunstone), but specially drawing.

Thanks for finding this little masterpiece, OP.

heal scrapper is still a thing in WvW iirc; condi cleanse for days.

There are still some unanswered questions about the Fractals, but people have made guesses.

4.1k hours and I precursor drop (Dawn) on the champ train in Frostgorge Sound. It was one of the champs on the NW of the map; I was too busy running to the next champ and had to link the drop much later that night so my husband to verify that it was indeed what I needed for Sunrise.  I have gotten 2 ascended chests drop. That's it.
---
raids are one of the few things that are actually worth doing in this game.
---
It's actual repeatable, engaging content that make use of the game's combat system.
---
TBH I don't see why anyone would bother playing this game without raiding.
---
I have to get my heal tempest updated still. I haven't changed it for like... 2 years.
---
Hi and thanks. One more is in my mind now is about inventory. Until I will figure out what is important, what I need to do with picked items while lvling? Sell/destroy, is there some tricks?
---
"Mist Juice"

---
Hell yes. Cuties. This is beautiful.
---
I want to come back to tyria. I left when lionstone(?) was destroyed. what BIG new things did I miss and is it possible to relive the living story again or did I missed it. Btw. Are you recommending coming back or is the gam dead? Is thief still hated so much in PvE?
---
this is so evil xD
---
You can buy asc gear for gems?
---
I've played for about 700 hours  less than you and my situation is around the same... if you don't count rare stuff from BL chests then an ascended weapon chest is the best drop for me as well
---
Thank you so much for the detailed response, that helps a lot! I won't lie, I was a tad confused with the energy when it first ran out in the middle of combat on me. Rangers and a few of the other classes were so intuitive to learn (They don't seem to have much to worry about at all in terms of extra mechanics), I kinda just presumed Revenant was the same. I'll definitely read up more about energy and probably switch to Hammer haha. Thanks again for the response!
---
Hey, thanks. Well I played eso pvp a lot, but dodge is more easy there xD
---
What do you think about action camera mode? I feel it's near to eso style, I'm planning to buy new mouse with side buttons (7)..
---
I admire you that you can play with those controls :o
---
I'm thinking about it or warrior, yes.
---
Either is fine
---
The game is pretty free in that you don't really have to force yourself to do any one thing in particular
---
I think it's a good idea to at least do the story once, maybe more if you're really interested, but after that it's pretty fair game
---
Map completion is largely a personal achievement, just if you want the label that says "this character completed the map". You also do get 2 gifts of exploration, which you need 1 to craft a legendary weapon, so that can also be a good incentive
---
Try joining a guild at r/guildrecruitment, they might be able to help you figure out what it is you want to do in game

---
&gt;Daily Achievements
---
Are those achievements work on free trial or only after I will get expansions?
---
I didn't say they were wrong about delays which the 4 months were. I said Anet you know the people who come up with the release schedule have not changed the 2-3 month schedule. Until Z comes out and says that they are changing the 2-3 month schedule this is the release schedule. Just because the community says episodes come out 3-4 months doesn't mean this is the schedule Anet are aiming for.
---
Ahh I usually get downvoted I'm used to it.
---
He wasn't farmed, though. I mean, I guess you could say "LOL JK MEME VID," but then it's a shitty meme. You should feel bad.
---
1) lion's arch
---
2) come on back, game is still definitely alive and getting new content
---
3) uhh...new stuff...that's been what, 5-6 years? So you're missing 4 seasons of living world content, 2 expansions, mounts, gliding, raids, elite specializations, a bunch of new zones, it might be easier for you to just read the returning player's guide on the sidebar
---
4) thief is fine, high dps, recently got a bit of an overhaul with some skills
---
Needs more Necro minions
---
This is why I hate lord
---
Dude, you should make a rap EP. Your flow is nearly on rythm.
---
I take it this means you couldn't think of a single reason why the buffs have any meaningful drawback in PvE. Thanks for agreeing with me, it was a good conversation.
---
And saying it's alive has the opposite effect? Because that sure worked for the Wildstar reddit...
---
Aye maybe I can finish my Amber weapons haha
---
Remember when they were in the story?
---
Tag is life.  Seriously.  Between damage mitigation and squad support dropping heals &amp; boons on the tag, that's the safest place to be.
---
Also, try steering with your mouse - keep the tag centered on your screen and drive towards it.
---
Jesus there is a new flying mount? I got the Griffon and then kind of put it down for a while.. i assume this one is insanely time consuming/expensive.. considering how hard the griffon was to get

more then 5k hours and around 20 pre, few infusions and what not.
---
Not to mention, dragons watch is literally the worst name made.  It barely makes sense anymore since hunting dragons is really no longer the goal, plus....almost every other person in DW besides you has had nothing to do with taking down any of the dragons or Balth.  I have no idea how the hell that won the player vote.
---
d/d can be fun to play but ever since the earth 3 range nerf I've been more ehhh about it
---
the problem I see with the OP's build is that you are essentially transforming into a bunkery support with some damage output for flavor. that is to say: this is not a solo roam build so much as it is a supporting build for small group roaming.
---
So out of curiosity I went to check out their channel and the first clip on the most recent video was them jumping on top of an afk reaper minionmancer :| A Daredevil shows up and tries to rub up the reaper but gets punished for doing so and the OP wins the 1v2... then immediately dies to a soulbeast that shows up.
---
don't get me wrong: I like d/d play. I just don't think this build is a particularly good one for roaming solo so much as it is for going with a group as a supplemental damage + utility source.
---
I got a precursor drop from the afk engi farm in lake doric before the nerf...good times
---
Ok bud
---
Got my first around 3.5k. Try pumping up your magic find, I didn't get shit until I maxed it then got 4 in a year
---
The build looks fine for what you need, so it could very likely be just how you play. Unfortunately, we can't critique your game sense/skill without actually seeing it
---
Imagine not taking firebrigade lol
---
They are available, however you'll only have access to enough of them to get the daily gold starting at level 11, and you'll only have access to the full selection at level 31.
---
I came here to say that. In fact, I have both the subreddits open and watching that bleed over here made me grin like an idiot lol
---
It wouldn't make sense. In PoF we did as we visited established, separated nation that cut it's ties with outside world some time ago and profession we knew evolved there in their own way.  
---
In HoT your fleet crashed into hostile jungle and are scraping to survive. There are no "jungle egineers" or "Itzel mesmers". Your Tyrians just learn new shit on the fly, cause jungle provides and eats your ass alive if you don't step up your game ;)
---
I had forgotten that healing builds existed! In open world you don't have much of a use for it I guess.
---
It's worth it. Tbh I had a lot of fun doing this one, but you do need 250 of each LWS4 map currency
---
Take
---
I'd probably suggest slotting in a ranged weapon in place of your Greatsword.  Sometimes you find a fight that just isn't comfortable to melee, and having the ability to kite while your cooldowns recover and still do damage is a good thing.  It's not the best situation for warriors, as Longbow is a condi weapon (and you're power) while Rifle just isn't very good, but since you're having trouble surviving as it is, putting a Rifle on can't hurt, even if it's just an exotic one.
---
Beyond that, it's just gaining experience.  You as the player, not your character.  Learn the tells of your opponents, learn what attacks you need to dodge (especially important when you're Berserk, as you'll take more incoming damage due to the -300 Toughness penalty), learn the optimal order to use your skills.  Everyone died a lot to Mordrem Snipers and Pocket Raptors and the like when Heart of Thorns was new, then they learned the methods to deal with them.  It's the same for you now, figuring out how to handle the White Mantle and the Jade Armour and the other new threats in the new zones, to say nothing of the new bosses.  Sometimes you might need more condi cleanse, sometimes you might need an extra stunbreak, and sometimes you might need to kite a bit.
---
Hello I want to sign up for 13 hours of DF farm please.
---
In HoT she's bae
---
I had a falling out with the game for a while, so I'm just getting back into the swing of the game. Getting my characters up to max and getting through the story/exploration is taking up most of my time before I try the harder stuff (fractals/raids). They're on my list eventually, but how far away eventually is idk
---
If your response to being called out for putting words into someones mouth is doubling down on it and doing it again, arguing is indeed pointless. Bye.
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be...
---
About 30, as I do a legendary farm Wednesday  through Sunday (so I have 2 weekend days).  And since I'll have an extra gift of exploration I can usually bang a 2nd one out on Monday to Tuesday if I get 9 hours of playtime total. (I'm always short on spirit shards....)
---
For VG, FB can't distort the green of course, but it's actually usually the next autoattack that kills tanks, if it hits before the tank has been healed after a green explosion. FB can just aegis itself after the green to survive the followup melee attack.
---
For Deimos, you do the exact same thing on FB as you do on Chrono to avoid the Pride explosion: you walk slightly away from Deimos when he does Mind Crush. Because Prides always detonate on Saul, and Saul always is meleeing Deimos, the Pride explosion is always very close to Deimos, so walking a small distance away during Mind Crush prevents the aegis removal.
---
For SH, she has two melee attacks she uses on the tank. One is an overhead smash where she raises her hammer and brings it down, this deals heavy power damage and is the one you must block. The other attack is a spinning horizontal arc, this one applies Torment and Poisoned and is not necessary to block, I usually allow these to land on me to conserve blocks for the harder-hitting overhead smash.
---
For Twins, it doesn't matter who tanks since the damage dealt to the tank is minimal. FB would make a fine tank because there are a lot of attacks that are nice to block, like the knockbacks, the boonsteal, and eggs. You'd have to bring a Renegade too of course for alacrity, and because Diviner Ren would probably be terrible here, you'd probably make the Ren heal, and either the Ren could tank with aegis from a condi Quickbrand, or the condi Quickbrand could tank with 1 toughness infusion or one piece of toughness gear.
---
Oh lord i'm just considering getting back into the game.. sounds like a long road
---
Ok, please report to your nearest DF instance and join a tag that is on the map.  Ask any questions you have in a respectful manner.  You keep your own loot but have to manage your own inventory.
---
If this is acceptable we will see you there.  Also there is a bonus on your 1,000th chest you open.  Consider it an incentive.
---
You are correct, manner doesn't matter.
---
I mean, he plays the game, why wouldn't he?
---
I did first day I got the game.. but I just can't see how anyone .. at least in this fight is willing to keep it on.. :(
---
7k+ hours and only got zap as a drop way back prior to HoT on Cursed Shore melandru temple.
---
Haha same here :)
---
condi ren is better now than it was prepatch omegalul
---
because Molten Core is level 60 lol.
---
like, people still need to learn the raids for any actual difficulty - even normal can be a pain in the ass sometimes for more casual groups, just like GW2.
---
granted, WoW raids are very gear dependent. mechanics and positioning are important, but I found it easier to raid in WoW than in GW2 just because of the different combat mechanics.
---
just wanted to set some stuff straight.
---
Me, too kid, me too...
---
Yes. VB feels like it was completely made for that mount.
---
Between the crash and the time the Pact Commander shows up isnt instant, you know. If there was enough time to set up camps theres enough time for a select few, strong individuals to become aquainted with their new powers and abilities, thus becoming mentors to people who have yet to take that path. They may not be experts with years of experience but theyre the ones that know the most. Much like Rytlock is the one to teach all future Revenents.
---
Wish you remembered the artist, this is amazing work and I've been looking to have some done of a couple of my toons.

And why can i still buy them although i have all tabs...

I couldn't see the shared inventory in the shop because i have them all, wiered.

I would jizz my fucking pants

This doesn't surprise me. They destroyed Mesmer phantasm builds a while back. They aren't above destroying build diversity.

Damnit, Anet. I want to keep giving you money. Up the cap!

There's a shop glitch that's been there for a couple of years now. Don't buy new bank tabs from the shop. Check the padlock *in your bank* to see if you can "actually" buy more.
---
There's a good reason they didn't post any golem stats. I'd be surprised if that build reached 10k with all boons, all profession buffs, a huge golem and all condis on golem.
---
Get a training guild. You will be helped. A lot.
---
Yeah i know, i am just happy everytime i see the banktap discount in the shop because i hope they made more tabs avaible but nope :(

[Sword](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwWhoCdFOhA)
---
[Dagger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dprp4S2uQ8c)
---
Both of them are very good, Dagger is a bit stronger but you have the annoying part of having to dash all around which can be a bit annoying on some bosses.
---
Nice, I think I will make use of those targeting modifiers for previous and closest.  Thanks for the reply!
---
MoM is a rather unique fight in that while you do greater damage while the break bar is damaged, the GREATEST damage comes from the bombs that people drop, so the reason why you hold off on CC is to allow the bombers time to get there, otherwise you break him too fast and he disappears before they get there and you do very little actual damage. The ramifications of letting him bite the island are actually very little. Losing an island is not that much of a consequence as the overall DPS can sometimes wipe him out in a single chomp, if timed correctly with the bombs and cc.
---
Basically the fight was created halfway un-intuitively that requires greater coordination to bring down quicker than just a zerg rush, which will actually hinder progress.
---
As others have said, dungeons are the go-to for low-level group content. But honestly, most of the sub-level-80 content is designed for solo play. You can all do dynamic events together throughout the open world. If I remember correctly, you can also do the personal story together as a party, if you want. But unless you all picked the same race and personal biography choices on character creation, you will progress through the story individually (whoever is currently on that exact story step—can be multiple people), but you'll still get XP. The story is relatively generous with how much XP it gives. If you want to play with your friends, then definitely focus on getting to level 80. No shortage of group content when you get to level 80, especially with the expansions.
---
IF Anet ever make a gw3, they really need to move away from whatever unit is that. It should say meters or something more clear than that.
---
Either sell it or keep it if you ever need something in Minstrel/Viper (still have 5 or each in my asceded mule because I didn't really get a use out of them).
---
Dungeons in general are less popular tbh.  The easiest way to get into a run tho is to post your own LFG on the lfg.  Just be sure to say what it is you exactly want to do.  I'd suggest having "First time, story, everyone welcome" as the LFG or something similar.
---
Keep in mind that these are initial benchmarks and some minor stuff could change but so far we have [sword at 38k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwWhoCdFOhA), [staff at 36-38k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKXe8S1GZm0) (though this is kind of a meme build with all the movement and aoes it needs to hit), and [dagger/focus at 39k](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dprp4S2uQ8c). Comments were saying that build + gear is the same as before too: https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/condition/
---
YES was waiting for this
---
Was around 138g when I looked a bit ago.
---
Wasn't a timer on it though.  But maybe through the weekend on length at least.
---
Mag has picked up guild wise. Looks like some YB transfered over.  We definitely have a pretty solid pug core. Also the old guard guilds never left Mag. 
---
Anyway, AR and Mag are practically made for each other. Still don’t have the coverage tier1 servers have, but this has been a great matchup. 
---
That being all said here’s a shoutout to BOZ and their excellent pugmanders.  Good work.
---
Headcanon that some warriors got real mad at cutting the vines and stuff so they set started setting everything on fire, including themselves.
---
Berserker heck yeah
---
If it was within the last week or so, contact support and just ask if you could get the difference reimbursed to you. I know they’ve been pretty good about doing that in the past.
---
You did it.  
---
You beat the game.
---
I always tell new players that Gw2 and Gw2 at 80 are two separate things. Game modes, builds, content, it's all so different. Mobs are different with the way they handle tells, dodging.. the stats available.. gear doesn't even matter until 80 as well, really. It makes me sad cause I've had some pals duck out before they even hit that mark, and that's when it actually gets interesting.
---
it gives me more time :P
---
you gotta pick something and make it interesting.  
---
for example woodenpotatoes had always much to do with lore. some people liked it so they stick to him in those matters.  
---
normal gw2 gameplay is simply not interesting. normal pve videos are boring as fuck because you can all those things yourself. the only videos every which get a bit more views are certain speedruns which are really crazy or bosskills in this matter.  
---
literally no one cares if you have not something going on for you if you just mine some stuff in the openworld. why would anyone watch that.  
---
as far as pvp goes, you kind of need to be good...why would anyone watch someone who doesn't know what he is doing and just being bad in the gameemode. same with wvw...2 zergs crashing or taking some keep in 2 mins is simply not interesting as a viewer...as a player, ofc, but viewing this? meh.  
---
in total: most gw2 stuff is simply not interesting and you need a topic you are going for if you want to make it interesting for the viewer.
---
&gt; Why do you think that the stream community is so low?
---
GW2 is a game people want to play by themselves, not just watch.
---
You wont grow your channel with this game. Use it as training ground to get comfortable with camera and mic, then play something else.
---
Fair enough! Hopefully I'll be interesting enough :D
---
Yes! This is why I'm attempting to avoid PvE content unless it's brand new (or something tough like raids).
---
I've thought a lot about this, and recognize it as one of the biggest challenges I'd have to overcome. Hoping to prod the community to help me solve this issue :)
---
I do understand your point - but the reality is that these "exploits" were abused for months / others for years... and because these "exploits" don´t get removed after reporting them this is the only way getting them fixed
---
I don't want to sound negative, and I only speak for myself here, but I really am not interested in streams. When it comes to GW2 (and other MMO's) if I watch anything it's YouTube. I find that vastly more useful because most things I want to see/find/understand are there in a single topic.
---
For example, the most efficient way to get x currency/material/whatever. How to do a particular puzzle/run. Obviously this is a fairly crowded field already, GW2 is not a new game. However I am fairly new to GW2 and when I look for certain things what I am finding is usually 3-4 years old or older. 
---
This may be something you aren't interested in doing, but a fresh look at the game from the ground up covering all aspects of gameplay from a tutorial point of view might be good. You could also include stuff like armour/weapons as well.
---
So it has a stamina bar like the griffon (it’s called “flight juice”) but they can fly further (and descend much slower than a griffon) and they have a dash ability for their actual stamina bar. They can also recharge their energy by hanging onto walls and bouncing off it. I’d recommend reading up on it since I’m winging my explanation here. But I hope that helps!
---
Err... What do these words mean in raid context?
---
&gt; What would you like to see?
---
Nothing. It's a very accessible game and better experienced first person.
---
lmfao OP being the one in chat
---
&gt; Dragon's Watch should have never been formed, those characters should have come and gone from the story when it needed them.
---
I agree completely, but those characters were set up as the "main hero team" long before Balthazar entered the story. *Under the condition of Kas&amp;Jory already existing* where LS3 left us they are the better choice for the faith stuff instead of shoehorning in an entirely new character. Let the Sunspears and OoS handle Joko.
---
This is a universal problem with GW2 though, instead of carefully molding existing assets to suit future needs (i.e. introduce Kasmeer's faith properly, give Marjory a reason to stay like maybe reviving her sister through Awakening) they add new things on a whim and leave the older ones to rot. PoF into LS4 was decent in that regard but I shudder to see that cast tagging along as generic Crystal Blossom heroes while we are forced to be friends with the next local representative.
---
Depends what you stream. No one wants to see open world.
---
Thinking of making a Norn because reasons, though I LOVE the T3 light and medium Human cultural armors. Anyone know of some similar armors I could use of those classes for a Norn? Because Fashion Wars is v real, and my next toon is likely either gonna be a Necro, Ele, or an Engi. Miiiiiight maybe a Guardian since Dragonhunters look fun to play whenever I see one in the wild, but I think I might be good on armor styles there.
---
This is fair and valid. Thank you.
---
nice
---
Excellent points. So far, my audio is clean and my cam is 720p. Can't currently afford a better one.
---
Can you share the details of the build you're using, please?  I've stayed away from Elementalist and Weaver because I dislike all the attunement switching. Your build sounds more manageable and fun, and I'd like to try it.
---
Lol what? No. Why do you think most Asian MMOs are F2P? This is the model that works the best for MMOs in terms of sustainable revenue. FFXIV is lucky it has the FF Franchise at its back and WoW had the Warcraft franchise.  These are literally the only 2 sub-based MMOs that are able to live on subs nowadays. Most MMOs, even ESO have had to go B2P just to become sustainable. Sub-based MMOs are the exception, not the norm.
---
Oh, I remember my guildies and I did that to our guild leader during WvW raids all the time, especially if he did something stupid like leaping off a tower and fell to his death. 
---
It’s an example of classic GW2 harmless trolling.
---
There are 3 major factors that determine whether or not someone is successful on twitch.
---
* The game being played is fun to watch and easy to understand.
---
* The person streaming is skilled.
---
* The person streaming is entertaining.
---
The first bullet point is far and away the most important, and the main reason why GW2 is an awful game to stream. By at large, GW2 is hard to understand and incredibly dull. If you've never played the game before, you'll be completely lost. Even as someone that's sunk thousands of hours into the game, trying to decipher what was going on in a PvP stream was impossible.
---
Teapot and Potatoes are both successful within the community because they are entertaining and skilled. But, because of how awful of a stream game GW2 is, they're relatively unsuccessful as streamers.
---
Anet effectively killed it's streaming scene by refusing to support it's partners and making the game more and more about solo content with no challenge.
---
The most popular streams besides community leaders like WoodenPotatoes and MightyTeapot, are either raid streams or high level pvp streams. In other words, people want to watch the most skilled players doing difficult content that many people never get to experience.
---
Short, sweet, and to the point. Thanks.
---
I’ve tried that all of last night, but usually people would just join and then leave without saying anything. Couldn’t get a group together unfortunately, but will try again tonight
---
Very true. It is definitely difficult to stream without Anet support.
---
Just isn't fun. I'll pick it up again once anet figures what they want it to be.
---
Thank you. Great observations.
---
Memory allocation is very tricky and is often the reason developers have artificial limits on items counts (256 often done as 0 to 255 is the most common example). In more modern languages this is less of a concern and developers have much greater room to over allocate but that doesn't remove it from being an issue.
---
Often times the issue can lie in other aspects, such as UI design or performance. As time moves forward UI's can be updated and performance improved but they can be bottlenecks that prevent developers from implementing things.
---
you could have just not watched, how did he waste your time
---
Excellent points. Visual clutter can be a big issue in a lot of games, but is especially bad here.
---
DD in wvw has been and still is comically op in wvw, not sure what your problem is, sounds like you're just bored with the game mode, not even caring to \_get\_ involved in a fight.
---
Imagine they actually announce that elite spec and they just re-use [that old launch warrior art.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/5/56/Warrior_04_concept_art.png)
---
Just gonna leave that upvote and back away
---
Yeah I know about that. I did that yesterday but people would just join and then leave shortly after without saying anything.
---
joy emoji ok hand
---
but we do have powercreep right now and the meta is extremely fixed because despite what you believe..it's the same shit as always
---
dhs and weavers as dps(now even stronger), mirage is the same broken bullshit..oh i guess chrono is a bit worse now but it's still being used
---
so pls explain how it shakes things up and not just buff what's already strong
---
also people get invested in their characters and not everyone likes jumping ship on patch day!
---
sure in lalaland you can just play your nerfed to the ground build no problem but good luck joining a lfg for raids or fractals with it
---
now mention how i should have a wide network of friends and acquantainces to never pug anything ever
---
Sometimes I really wished in game the stuff looked just as good as he art. In game the outfit looks so bulky.
---
Buy the recipe from the master crafyrr near the crafting station
---
Where is the hypocrisy? Is watching public streams stalking now?
---
You buy the reciepe from master armorsmith,  tailor or leatherworker.. to make it you need 5 gossamer patches,  5 ecto and 5 t6 blood
---
It's possible to get up there at the moment with the skyscale with very little effort. Renders the whole key thing a bit moot and increases the risk that someone will have killed it at the wrong time for it to sync up with the end of FE.
---
sigh.. i got like 10g atm, and i'm 50g away from howler.. next time.. but ty for the info!
---
I'm pretty sure I bought the game close to release so that sounds right, I just shot what age gave me lol, I probably should have done some rounding lol
---
Biggest regret was holding onto GW1 for so long instead of just moving over and realizing how great this game is.
---
For male or female? You could look through the armor galleries (in game or [on the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Armor)) to see if there is anything you like. Maybe the bladed set, whisper's secret, or warbeast but it really comes down to gender, which weight you really want to go with, and what parts of teh cultural armor you like (the blades, the amount of clothing, the general style?)
---
Hey,
---
I stream a decent chunk of GW2 as it is one of my favorite games. I found that regular PvE isnt that enjoyable to watch so I do mostly WvW (with the best WvW guild in the game HATE). If you want to stream for views then this isn't the game to play. Also doesn't hurt to have a schtick as well. Mine is...interesting to say the least but is pretty fun.
---
Great input, thanks :)
---
Thanks for this! Great to hear from another streamer. Obviously building a following would be awesome, but I love this game for the game and community. That's why I want to stream.
---
Streaming has long ago turned into a cult of personality- or of image, if you want to understand it. What game are you playing and what are you doing in there is, at best, secondary.
---
Why are you being downvoted...?
---
I upvoted you back; but if I were you I'd think if this is the community you want to stream to...
---
I usually stop to help players that seem new. It doesn't take that much extra time for me to kill a mob or help with a hero point, and occasionally I have the time to help someone looking for something particular. I remember at headstart and getting help from other players then, so why not extend the knowledge I have to the fresh player base now? :)
---
And personally, to put it simpler. The game is F2P. Why would I watch someone play? I can just go there, get it, and be playing myself
---
Much appreciated! The majority of the community I've met is fantastic and makes me keep coming back to the game.
---
it's the best contested dungeon opener mount
---
I ask years later. Why do we care?
---
Isn't the whole outfit fiasco caused by people crying because of some clipping.
---
&gt; but isn't it reasonable to assume that they probably have a spare terabyte of space hanging around?
---
Not really. For example, DE said the same thing about their (*idiotic*) Riven mods. Players are only allowed 90 total, because of memory limits. It may not be a simple issue of saving a database file, but managing it and being able to call it in reasonable time for players.
---
I think that most GW2 players will rather go play into the game than watch streams...usually :)
---
Very valid. I did have someone this morning who decided he would start playing the game after watching my stream and asking questions. That felt good :)
---
of what year?
---
Imo, the streaming views are so low because the game itself is extremely boring to watch. Lets think:
---
If you try to stream pug raids 90% of your stream will be people standing still to form lfg. And if you stream yoir static's only the small raiding community will watch.
---
If you try to stream pvp no one will understand anything that is happening, so they quickly move on.
---
If you try to stream WvW it'll be a huge mass of people where you can't even see the streamer's character. What is there to watch? The bigger zerg swallowing the smaller one? BOOOOOOOORIIIING.
---
What's left to stream? Daily fractals? Open world? Who will ever want to watch that?
---
And for the sake of arguments, I hardly think "being interesting" is part of the problem. There's plenty of uninteresting streamers on games like League of Legends and Fortnite that have thousands upon thousands of viewers.
---
Truth is, gw2 is simply boring to watch.
---
These are all viable points. I recognize that this is a challenge, and maybe gw2 isn't the game I should be streaming, but someone new joined the game today because they enjoyed my stream, so that feels nice.
---
Available as part of an outfit for only 1200 gems
---
I figured.  Probably required a tad more finesse though. Skyscale just sort of breezes up there with little to no work at all.
---
Because it's... fun? :schoked: I mean, certain games are delightful to watch, I remember the golden days of Starcraft II, I could watch that the whole day, super nice.
---
Well out of the [light](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Norn_female_light_armor), [medium](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Norn_female_medium_armor), and [heavy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Norn_female_heavy_armor) norm galleries. 
---
Light has a ton of options like [feathered](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Feathered_armor), [winged](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Winged_armor), [apprentice ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Apprentice_armor), [carapace](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Carapace_armor), etc.
---
Medium has [predatory](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Predatory_armor), [sneakthief](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sneakthief_armor), [envoy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experimental_Envoy_armor_\(medium\)), [viper](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Viper%27s_armor) (at least a little bit), and a couple others.
---
Heavy has [grasping dead](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grasping_Dead_armor), [Eagle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Eagle_armor), [stag](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stag_armor), [barbaric](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Barbaric_armor), [gladiator](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gladiator_armor), [pit fighter](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pit_Fighter_armor).

You can also see if there are any [outfits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Norn_female_outfits) you like such as [elonian elementalist](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elonian_Elementalist_Outfit) or [Kasmeer's regal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kasmeer%27s_Regal_Outfit).
---
Yes but power DPS means having to play a Power class; and doing the Power rotations. As much fun as contemplating why you're still playing GW2 during the Deadeye/Guardian rotation is, shit gets boring after a while. Only remotely fun Power Rotation still around is power Weaver and that still uses a Conjure.
---
Only time I've seen turbo metaslave chronotanks is in the 6-8 guild tag groups, and there've been less and less of those.
---
If you're serious; it's less whining and more apathy. This patch was the last stray for me. Might as well get a few good kicks in before it croaks.
---
You probably should be looking at IRL streams and what they offer, how they capture their audience - and then do the same, just with GW2 gameplay in background, and maybe the topics would be sometimes GW2 (or gaming in general)-related
---
[bdsm indeed](https://twitter.com/stjepansejic/status/894954564344041473?lang=en) (sfw)
---
This is fantastic advice, thank you!
---
I know they are the exception. They are also 2 of the best right now. Theirs a reason for that regardless of whether you accept it or not.
---
Asian MMOs have worked in Asia. As soon as they attempted the same plans in the west they failed miserably. BDO being one of the few exceptions. 
---
I'll always prefer a sub fee over F2P shit. F2P always ends up having some kind of pay 2 win. I'd rather not have to deal with pay 2 win bullshit (anything that is not cosmetic only is pay 2 win). 
---
I never said being a sub based MMO is easy, but those that are made well and updated often will always be better that f2p or even buy 2 play. They don't have to constantly try to get more revenue from their shop etc. They can focus on patches and content more because of the sub money.
---
That's kinda false:
---
* **Scrapper:** The guys at [SCAR Bivouac](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/SCAR_Bivouac)
---
* **Druid:** Just add some [original druid](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Druid_(group\)) NPC.
---
Most of the rest could be linked to Zephyrites, Itzel, Nuhoch, Quetzal, or Exalted. Even further, the elite specialization mentors could be part of the Pact itself, and don't need to be native to the jungle.
---
They just got mad during [the first adventure](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tendril_Torchers).
---
financially stable doesnt mean it's not dying. sure, you get casual players who buy gems for new shinies on the store. but they just run around in open world or LA. hardcore scene/community is basically non-existent, everyone is leaving. finding party for CMs+t4 in lfg can take hour or more, or you can forget about it depending on time of day. raids too, not to mention dungeons. idk about pvp but i constantly read ppl here that its infested with bots and afkers. 
---
when ppl are saying "dead game" they dont mean their financial success but the lack of community to do stuff. why is there no community? because the content is bad or too far in between. or not very repeatable like raids.
---
could get there without any mount https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Class_I_Rift_Stabilizer#Locations the 9th location
---
I don’t think there’s any greater fundamental misunderstanding of how shitposts function than somebody outright labeling it “shit post.” The entire point of a shitpost is that it’s ironically terrible. You can’t had irony when you put a big fucking disclaimer on the joke warning people.
---
ill await the theorycrafters report then thx ^^
---
5.5k h. No exciting drop yet.
---
That was something that was changed globally in the game where you can logout at one spot and end up at a slightly different spot after you log back in
---
They did fix it. Just this last Tuesday.
---
A lot of artists tend to get busy and not have the time or energy to pay tribute to stuff they did before they got "big gigs" like a regular published comic and DC contracts?
---
There are specialisations mentors in path of fire?? I've only played it once through on my revenant but I swear I haven't seen anything like that.
---
Don't know time played without logging in, but I ahve 8k pvp matches played. No rpecursors or infusions. I got 3 Tequatl chests when i still did pve, and have equpped 2 characters in weapons and armour from ascended chests from champ bags in pvp rewards.
---
Sort of fine with me as I don't care about cosmetics, or gold.
---
Find others to get on mic with you.  Try new things, fun off meta builds.  Host events too.  Find out what people want to do with a group that otherwise wouldnt be there and do that with your streamers.  From all the other comments here yeah people prefer to be in game than watch streams, so get people to watch and play with you.
---

---
No one's ever posted about a sale in this subreddit before! It's must've been paid for by anet!
---
please give us our beloved chrono back.
---
Scrapper is a nickname the....iron legion?  uses for itself.
---
RIP my beloved chrono.
---
The problem with Citadel of Flame is that it tends to not be open, since it requires completion of a meta event for people on that map to even get in there (...or have someone already in the instance).
---
It's *possible* to get in without completing the meta, but I'm not exactly sure how. Probably something to do with standing in a particular spot and hitting the enter instance button before you get teleported away from the locked portal.
---
CoF is a pretty good dungeon, though.
---
Personally I get people when I do a variety of content at a high level of gameplay, people like to see hard content made trivial
---
Hit up ranked PvP, do some big zerg commanding in WvW or speedrun some raids
---
Otherwise get lucky and make a streaming career around conversing about the games ins and outs, it's not just do this and that to get to the top here 
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
JESUS! Guy is selling FOUR Dusks! Meanwhile, I've been playing since headstart and never even once had a precursor drop for me! Fuck this RNG!
---
Love his art though, but seriously fuck RNG!
---
I'd like to see more pvp. Most play WvW. I just like to watch ranked/unranked games.
---
Pretty old art of mine but oh well  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
My favourite part was when the music dropped and you used wings of resolve. 360 noscope ezpz.
---
Good vid.
---
Said thank you as soon ad he came over
---
I missed them in S4 ; - ;
---
They are adapting @&gt;@
---
Apex is free to play, why do others watch people play that?
---
I catch myself doing that all the time. If I see someone with no points or down arrow, I tend to hang around and help them get hearts or stuff.
---
Maybe lack of a proper system to play it, or reliable internet connection? Or simply the ability to play for whatever reason. I wouldn't be able to tell exactly, but it's certainly not a case of "if you can play football, why do you watch it", though.
---
&gt; \-Mute asuras only 
---
\*angery gesticulating\*
---
While the whole I'd rather play it myself excuse is valid and not something you could argue against, personality also plays a big role, most streamers are not that fun to watch (imo) they often put on fake personalities and behave loud and obnoxious, or you get the complete opposite where they are quite and barely interact with the viewers and once in a while answer some questions in a low and barely recognizable tone.. Streaming isn't as easy as you think and it's most certainly not cut out for the most of us. And streaming 1 single game is pretty much a death sentence for any sort of success you were hoping to gain xD 
---
Tldr: go stream, have fun, don't expect too much.
---
If they'd up the cap with 100, they could abandon GW2, live of the money from the banktabs and make a GW3 engine lul.
---
Don't give them ideas you fucking moron.
---
Sadly Reddit is the wrong place to be asking these things. Many of the comments or viewers here aren't interested in Twitch in general. Try going into some of the more popular GW2 streamers and ask them some of these things and I think you'll see a more positive response. 
---
That doesn't mean the feedback here isn't valid or important, GW2 isn't an overly popular game to watch on Twitch and people here have already listed the reasons why.
---
Do it for fun, build your community, be regular (something I suck at). Get in twitch chat and be part of the general community.
---
My point is that a game being F2P doesn't mean people won't watch it. In fact most of those games do better because everyone can play it for free. Fornite or League of legends for example.
---
