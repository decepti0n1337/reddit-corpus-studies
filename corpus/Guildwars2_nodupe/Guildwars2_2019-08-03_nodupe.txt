Heart of Thorns also gives the Dragonhunter and Berzerker specializations for Guardian and Warrior respectively, and they get a lot of mileage out of Greatswords and Hammers.

---
GW2 support has never failed me. Whoever helped develop support for Arenanet should be running the company, imo.
---
Because no announcement would have been better than paying for a Blizzcon Ticket to get the one thing they would hate the most, since Diablo has been mostly a PC playarbase for decades now.
---

---
They were not expecting Diablo 4, but they were hoping for something like a DII remaster, or a new class for DIII, or something, anything but a Mobile game that can't be played on PC and that won't have any of its new assets and interesting mechanics added to DIII.
---
And you aren't one of the classes that was involved in one of the previous two passes of "elite spec tradeoffs", are you? Mirage is on the chopping block for that still.
---
If you're a talented programmer and game designer with experience balancing competitive game modes, and you're confident you can deploy these changes faster than they do, you should apply for a position with ArenaNet!  I'm sure they'd love to have your expertise on board!
---
I'm SICK and TIRED of WVWers thinking that what THEY do takes MORE skill than FARMING SILVERWASTES and WORLDBOSSES
---
Shifted towards open world and gem store, and I wish I was joking.
---
It doesn't even have a build anymore and you would nerf it some more? Seriously?
---
Problem with mesmer elite spec tradeoffs is that core mesmer is compeltely unplayable in every kind of content if you make elites on the same level as core mesmer, than they are all unplayable.
---
&gt; But you don't have any resources to look out for,
---
What class(es) have you played?
---
Oh, i seriously don't want to work for a company with as crappy management as ANet.
---
And the fact that i don't want to live in USA.
---
Mesmer will be fine. You can literally pick any weapons and any trait line and make a good build as long as you have Mirage equiped.
---
Man can't wait for peoples phones to explode.
---
Fun &gt; Balance
---
I'm still looking for a game where I can have the kind of buildcrafting fun that I had in GW1.
---
"It doesn't have a build anymore" is a colossal exaggeration.
---
And, sure, core mesmer isn't in a place to be used. But that's the same with every other profession, and Anet needs to fix that universally.
---
The salt is mostly due to people wanting more content. I think even a salty player would agree the game is good
---
This must be new
---
only a noob would write what you just wrote
---
Yes, "Quick and Quiet" as we Ash trash like to put it. Stealth is the name of the game here. :)
---
What in the hecc. Wow guild wars is lewd.. and strangely modern. 😂 Never saw that side of it before. Sounds much more interesting than the charr or sylvari personal stories.
---
&gt; Are you ready to catch the very first look at an all-new chapter in Guild Wars 2‘s Living World story?
---
It's obvious that they talk about LS5. There is no "hidden hint" only because they don't use the exact words "season 5".
---
Are either of those boats functional or just a decoration?  Can you sail on them?
---
Announcement will definitely about LS5 and not about mobile versions.
---
CI mesmer? Yeah, it actually is. Some classes could do absolutely nothing against it (like Necromancer).
---
Tijehnka Bonebiter, at your service. 
---
I'm slowly compiling a "canonical" Bone warband!
---
i have a good friend who's mained mes for years, and i've dueled him a bunch on that build. tough, but far from the hardest thing to fight
---
None now. Because of HoT and PoF power creep, they are all spammy and mindless.
---
The whole profession should get another look at by the devs
---
I’m not sure what tier you play in, but I’m pretty sure most people will agree necro is an easy class to do damage on, but not sustain, so easy comes with a caveat. Consider doing heavy damage, while sustaining heavy damage? Sounds like a warrior.
---
Other than that, the lack of formatting makes this really hard to read and digest :/
---
Or at least buff kits and we have to do more kit swapping, doing the rotation more enjoyable
---
LOOOOOL,so ppl cried and ANET DISABLE SKILL IN PVP FOR MONTHS :DDDD wow, 10/10 balance team right there XD
---
Now this is HOW YOU DONT BALANCE GAME AT ALL,oh my fucking god,this is just embarasing. so whats next? we gona disable everything what deals dmg and stuns? :DD this is just bad and terrible precedence. this is literaly inept balance team = we dont know how to balance it,so we just gona remove it,till we figure something out. just wow.
---
Difference between NA and EU raiding scene is just the LFG. On NA most raiders are organized in statics and/or guilds. On EU more players pug raids. But its changing towards more statics on EU as well, due to so many leaving / having left. You can btw transfer between EU and NA for a small gems-fee, so dont worry about it.
---
If you are interested in raids, joining a training guild is the way to start on that. From there you can then find a guild/static for your weekly raids.
---
The amount of wvw tokens you need for legendary weapons is about what... 5-10 hours spend in wvw? Its really not dramatic. I just do the wvw dailies when I need it.
---
The split in the community is mostly due to arenanet changing their target audiance after HoT expansion. Before they focused more on creating challenging content, now they focus on casual content. So if you are looking for the next mmo to raid in, or do hardmode stuff, gw2 offers you only limited content.
---
Still, the game itself is very enjoyable, the combat mechanics, older graphics (really not liking the fluffy stuff they've been adding lately). So imo its money and time wellspent. Its just not a game to solely focus on anymore.
---
Is your friend actually good at the game?
---
Honestly, in plat 1 I have been losing 1v1s against BOTS based on chaotic interruption. This had to happen and "degenerate" was the right word choice ;)
---
Charr mesmers unite! I went for a desert (kinda) look

---
The personal story has a lot of dialogue gems. It's become underrated over the years. I'd enjoy a solid personal story QoL update.
---
These are all true and I get the issue here. It's just a huge bummer there hasn't been a new genstore armor set in years and the closest we get is helm/shoulders/glove sets. I'm fine with them cranking out hella outfits but I wish they hadn't abandoned genstore armor sets.
---
No one is complaining about how the game looks, how action combat is, how the story is. We are complaining for a complete lack of communication, and the uncertainty that is raids, fractals, pvp, WvW. We just have to wait a month to hear anything.
---
Lets be honest. Any random outfit from gemstore looks way better than any armor set from the game.
---
I find that hard to believe considering the market Anet is in.  I do live in a more expensive market, but my pretax salary alone is over double that working in IT for a public entity, and if I went to a private company I could stand to get much more.
---
If you must leave the game to get informations about ingame events, that's bad Gamedesign. A filter function would be kinda cool.
---
For which the game was much newer
---
You should maybe add PvE to that because in PvP Holo is absolutely bonkers and should be nerfed.
---
They said that they are looking into expanding current maps as an alternative.
---
I heartily recommend the engineer. You can build it to be a healer, a tank, or to do DOT-based dps at a very competitive rate. You have more utility and versatility than almost anything else. Need a lot of crowd control? No problem, you can knock enemies back, launch them, stun them, daze them, and bitchslap them about every 4 seconds if that's what you want to do. Need to keep people alive? No problem, you can heal others almost as much as the best heal classes in the game, and provide blinds (next enemy attack misses) every 5 or 6 seconds, and even stealth (enemy cant see you). You can keep enemies poisoned, burning, bleeding, confused, and generally hating themselves for encountering your character. Oh, mobility? Yeah, no big deal, jet packs are cool but what about rocket boots? Just fly forward every 10 seconds. And you can keep yourself moving at almost the max moving speed for a non-mounted character, all of the time, with minimal effort.
---
As far as complexity goes, the difficulty of mastering the rotation for the condition (DOT) engineer is not rivalled by much else than elementalists, and like many condition based builds, even if you fuck it up your damage won't take a gigantic hit.
---
If that isnt enough, we havent even talked yet about the elite specs if you choose to get an expansion pack...
---
Well I am pretty happy with the model they run. It's one of the more customer friendly ones but I guess people rather pay sub model and have a ingame shop...and pay $30 to change realm to a not dead server.
---
Don't know about wow. Didn't play it since lichking. Then they certainly hadn't a conversion. Also why should they have one. I mean they run sub model so there shouldn't be a real currency shop right? Whaaat they have both...
---
The only thing I'd prefer from anet would be that they stick to their ls/addon cycle but lets see what the 30th brings.
---
I think most people are happy without a sub. That way you only play when you actually enjoy it and not feel forced since your sub is running. Probabbly op also got this message from the community and deleted the topic because of it.
---
Is stealth not a thing anymore?
---
The world is amazing. The gemshop characters however......
---
Good thing they didn't spend their time balancing Mesmer by needlessly murdering Chronomancer shatters in an incredibly recent balance patch.
---
Except for those awful looking minions right there
---
I played Holo rifle today in Golem and my dps was bad with the rifle rotation (between 27-28k) with the previous rotation, tomorrow I'm going to probe a new rotation then before work.
---
The trait itself isnt even an issue, the problem lies in daze mantra and mirage cloak
---
Amateur hour nonsense as is tradition.
---
Clarification on flavor: Dragon Hunter would have been "Witch Hunter" or "Witcher" if this was a different game. I.e. People who specialize in tracking, finding, and killing evil supernatural creatures.
---
I'm aware. Hambow variants were pvp builds.
---
I got the raptor skin with my first key and the outfit with my 4th.
---
To show some respect I used up all my 25 keys and got nothing good since then lol...
---
Ultra cheesy but works well :D
---
That's what she said? 😉
---
Yeah, you've made an excellent observation. I need to 'reality check' my game's FoV setting and see how it feels. TY! 😃
---
that's a long-ass way to say maybe
---
Review how they left GW1 and believe it.
---
Because POF was pretty much five living story releases bundle toghether and specs (as we have seen they are more than capable of releasing mounts with ls episodes). So if ppl ask for expansions they are asking for new e-specs, right? Because that would be the only thing ls seems not to be capable of.

---
I am not part of the narrative team or anything, but I am quite sure they can stretch the dragon arc way beyond the death of the three known remaining Elder Dragons (or buffer the inbetween bits), considering "mother", further "dragon replacements", the overall balance of magic... so yeah, you can't really treat a game-defining theme as a point on a checklist. 
---
But there /will/ be other stuff in between, as they have proclaimed themselves.
---
I’ve yet to do the 8 orbs achieve, do you think the power mirage build will be good for it?
---
Technically the only thing expansions achieve is to bring nearly every active player to pay at least once per cycle.   We don't know how many new players gw2 has. I would say quite a lot regardless it's release cycle because for new players it is irrelevant if an expansion is around or not. For mmos withz big marketings during releases it would be different, but than it comes down to the marketing, not the expansion. But that is something gw2 lacked during the pof days heavily. Returning players on the other hand are returning for both. Episodes and expansions alike. But most of them only pay for one of them. So yeah, expansions will bring more revenue, of cause, but not because they are the "better deal" but just cause of their demanding factor.
---
Imagine how terrible the reaction would be if they disabled it with no communication, and how wonderful it is now that they did communicate their reasons (and it helps that they're very VERY serious reasons). It makes all the difference.
---
So I liked the theming and mobility of Mirage, and leveling a Mesmer is being lots of fun, the shatter combos are really satisfying!  
---
But I only have PoF, so I won't be able to follow the meta viper condi build. What should I do gear-wise? Go power for now, switch when I get the first expansion? Or go with some other condi armor plus Nightmare runes?  
---
I still want to play Mirage/Mesmer .-.
---
I don't know that they will miss much on a mount; not getting dragged into combat means I can just freely look around and turn my camera and appreciate the view.
---
Came to check if the GW2 community was as bitchy as it was when I left. And it still is. XD lob y'all
---
Capitalism.

Them T1 pros man lmao
---
Hey all,
---
Some of you that may know me know how much I love map breakouts simply for the fun and challenge involved in climbing to as far and difficult heights as possible. I have many goals still that haven't been obtained, but tonight my friend Twindread and I managed to do one of them which we had been working on for a long time but gave up on many different occasions -- the top area of the Solid Ocean fractal!
---
Out of the many many different things we've tried, this is one of the worst ones in terms of sheer luck and patience involved in order to get up here. I made sure to record as much as I could because the honest truth is we'll probably never manage to get up here again!
---
Sadly in order to get up even further, it's even worse and during our attempts we fell and can't get back up. Hope you guys enjoy! Very neat views up here :)
---
I know right? :P
---
Engi will probably get a buff to the explosives line next major balance patch (they still need a proper dps choice in the GM slot), and holo stuff may continue to get tweaked here and there.
---
At least the current sword 150 heat build has respectable damage, both in raids and fractals.
---
I have faith that random people would be very kind, but in my experience, fractals and raids are where the people with the least patience and the worst tempers will be. and if they see this post, there really are people salty enough to think the game is better off without either of you, and they WILL justify to themselves why they should tell you that. im not one of those people but they browse this subreddit and i only hope they are too tired rn to work themselves up into the type of manic garbage spewing ive seen a few times now.
---
Blizzard's main faux pas was announcing that to their primarily PC-based audience without any news on D4 or something that the audience was actually interested in. If ANet announced a mobile version of GW2 as a sideshow to a new expansion reveal, for example, I imagine it would be received a lot better by their primary audience.
---
If only they could hear us about the bots...
---
Wow, that's really terrible implementation... you should not be able to take a trait that is disabled and therefore does nothing.
---
My bad, I'm fairly new to the game if it wasn't obvious.
---
Do the AoEs only inflict direct damage? They take 95% reduced direct damage, but 95% reduced condition duration, so all player summons melt in AoEs that apply conditions
---
&gt;fun
---
What is this word you speak of? Is it the feeling you get when you open lootboxes?
---
CONvenience
---
&gt;only **requires** me
---
I can press all my buttons into thin air if I want to, but if you have a cohesive build you can hold 1 and dodge the big attacks and complete everything in open world + story. Gw2 is baby mode, sometimes you things just sit there and don't attack you, don't even do any animations for attacking, for like 3 seconds straight. It's kind of ridiculous.
---
Necro has plenty of sustain. It has a heal skill for one health bar and a second health bar that regenerates just by using skills. Warrior in endgame pve is a glass cannon just like everyone else and in open world it's only the third tankiest class behind mesmer and necro.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sorry for formatting, I was rushing since I had to go do something x:
---
Or you could play mirage **without** CI like you used to, so it's still obnoxious but not as bad :)
---
Why was this trait op in pvp? I'm curious. Heard lot of hate even as a pure casual pve player so this must have been so broken.
---
Basically the only time UI updates get shipped are when a dev works on it in their free time, like the material storage overhaul. Otherwise they just get assigned to stuff that most likely either makes Arenanet $$$ or is tied to the next LS release. Arenanet never looks back to fix things that were released in the past unless its gamebreaking or to nerf its economic value.
---
If you look at the other comments the guy I responded to made in this thread, he's clearly a troll and has no interest in any sensible discussion. Plus it's an insanely old account with only a couple thousand karma so...do what you will with that info.
---
to use WoW-based terms, most of the classes here are cooldown-based, not resource based. that being said, thief (initiative and malice), Warrior (adrenaline), Mesmer (illusions), Holosmith (Heat), Necro (life force), Revenant (energy), have resources that u definitely need to manage. that's 6 classes out of nine
---
Livid Farm in Runescape says hi.
---
Nah, you’re the incorrect one here. If everyone who cares leaves, what will new players think when they queue for pvp and the queue time is 15 minutes? What about when they check the raid lfg for training raids and see only the two raid sellers forever afk in the lobby? After the erp the only force keeping the endgame pve community alive will be snowcrows, and as more and more veterans leave for lack of content, the guilds and communities that run open world will fall apart. We’ve already seen it with wvw to a large extent.
---
Absolutely stunning.
---
I was running on 10 year old hardware and just updgraded and the game is running much better than ever before.
---
You do not need a very expensive graphics card. I am playing on a mobile version of a 1060Ti and running almost everything on high on a 1080 monitor. The RTX series are probably overkill for this game. A 1050 could probably run it just fine on medium.
---
I'm not a computer guy so I cannot tell you about AMD series cards. I just know the bare minimum about the nvidia ones.
---
  
---
Also, as vagbond says below, you may need to get a newer motherboard, as old motherboards cannot really handle new graphics cards or cpus.
---
OOH! OOH! THE SECOND ONE!
---
Uhhhh. Holo lost damage from the patch. Like, a significant amount of damage...

Lol playing the karma card and calling me a troll.

This is a really, extremely, obtusely bad opinion.
---
a. People with great skill sets are busy. They often already have more senior positions, higher paying positions, more socially useful positions, etc. elsewhere.
---
b. If it is a management problem, a new skilled employee may not be able to fix it. Perhaps ANet is unreasonably slow about committing to live servers regardless of reason. So a coder gifted with a miracle skill from god will still be slowed down by bad priorities or policies.
---
c. It's highly reasonable for people without the expertise to fix a problem to accurately assess it and criticize it. If a heart surgeon has a 0.0% success rate, I couldn't tell him off my cuff what he is doing wrong, but I can certainly suggest that someone who has literally never succeeded is not

It is mate. I just love exploring the world they have given us. Specially the Labyrinthine cliffs and the Crystal Desert.

Thanks for reminding me of that. Good hunting.

Really cool screenshot!
---
The proof is in the pudding on this one. People are quitting, guilds are dying, the entire hardcore community has basically up and left and the raid scenes is barren. Many are quitting and the rest are extremely unhappy, vocally so. Clearly the player base isn't getting what they want, so you saying "but this is what the player base wants!" really has no foundation.
---
This should really be the effect of equipping double.
---
play PoE then.
---
Hell yeah! Same here my dude/dudette. It is the most fun thing to do in the game that takes a hell of a lot more patience and practice than anything else I've found.

He's not even in his final form yet, I'm going with the braided mohawk and Bearclaw scarred face.
---
Since I have Scandinavian heritage, most games with Norse-like races resonate with me. But unfortunately,  the Norn makes are far too wide for my tastes, why can't there be a thinner and muscular Norn Model? I'm not the Hulk Anet.
---
This trait allowed Mirage to bomb their opponents mercilessly with conditions with no  counterplay to it,  it didn't mattered if you had access to CC breaks, once locked crown in CI it was a frustrating path to condi death,  with your character rendered to a rag doll.
---
If this is your attempt at saying my reading comprehension level is low maybe you should look up the word "Inference". What ever comes next would be considered Living World Season 5 since it is not an expansion.
---
It seems that once they've bought into the lie, there's no turning around. Idk why. They just viciously defend microtransactions as if the only way to keep servers running for a game is to just focus 50% of your efforts on a cash shop and put half the shit you can obtain in the game into that shop lol. It's completely ridiculous that anyone buys into it. My favorite one is "well this is how they fund employees who make new content!" What new content? That's right, more shit to put on the gemstore, stuff so they can fund newer content, like even more shit to put on the gemstore. Brilliant. Keep buying in I guess, thanks for helping to ruin gaming.
---
And not even that looks that great due to their crooked spines

Maybe thought "with Iron Legion Soldier" meant sexy time? I mean, not my thing personally, but that could be Lewd.

I just think its indecent and scandalous to drink and drive ig?? Lewd has more than just the sexual meaning

You can check out the Open World [Axe Infinite Horizon build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage_-_Axe/x_Infinite_Horizon) and the Open World [Staff Infinite Horizon build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage_-_Staff/Staff_Infinite_Horizon). They both have a "Budget Equipment" section that you should be able to get: Rabid/Rampanger + Nightmare Runes.

in the character creation screen, light 4 is a selection to colour your skin. in normal sunlight peach ice dye will very closely match that. however it also depends on the material/armour, is it mat or shiny....

Which is something I dislike as well. They did not say expanding, they said revisiting too, which can mean another Kessex Hills/Lions Arch Situation where content is actively removed via reworks instead of added.
---
Mesmers: Reeeee just add an ICD! Stop bullying us!
---
If it were that simple (you know, employing simple solutions SPLIT into that one game mode vs haphazard changes across the board), a lot of classes would have been in a better state than they are now.

Well I see what you mean, but to be honest with you I'm hesitant to agree given how I have seen the latest fractals released. The maps are not nearly as fun to explore in as the legacy ones are, partly in the way they are designed and due to thehorrible invisible wall placements. I think if they were to update older maps they would just make them less fun, at least for me
---
Welcome to necro minions, enjoy your no green VG.
---
That is literally being undermonetised... Bunch of loot boxes, basic features, toys, minis, pretty skins. Hilariously tame.
---
Well maybe spend sub money of 15€/month on glider skins, how about that.
---
You realize that's not the decision of the people who make the game content, right?
---
As is the  case for arguably all other legendaries, infinite gathering tools, character inventory slots, bags beyond 20 slots...they are all convenience things that have way higher costs with functional cheap alternatives. These sigils and runes are nothing new in that regard, just the newest addition in the list.

By the way how many times did you have to nag Ben until he finally gave in and convinced the balance team to delete your OP spec's hardcounter?

Not that long ago they were forced by NCSoft to fire 143 people.

You really think they have freedom to allocate whatever they please?

That example was a monumental fuck up and bear in mind that with EVERY SINGLE BAN WAVE, people cry that they didn't deserve it or were false positives. And 99% of them fully deserve the ban.

Reminds me of those players on the LoL forums that would cry about being banned for toxicity and then a Riot moderator would come and post some of their chat logs into the thread.

there are probably not many people left at anet that are familiar with the code from GW1

It's harder to get out of bounds now due to the new invisible ceiling. This ceiling wasn't there last year and if you had the height you could get out without too much effort. Just wanted to walk on the ceiling and share, plus an area you can stand on higher up in the map. Also here's a view of the void \[Underneath the Crown Pavilion\]( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StsnH9Kvz50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StsnH9Kvz50) )

The Smiter's Boon (GW1) treatment, I suppose.
---
Ayyyyyyy
---
I especially like the haze that envelopes the world barely distant for your character, and also how the game runs at 20-30fps in crowded areas since the game only uses a single core of my cpu
---
&gt;As a game developer
---
Of what?
---
&gt;this isn’t true in the slightest. 
---
Specifics?
---
Wait are you talking about FOV or the camera vertical height?

Every now and then I play in first person mode, just to appreciate the art. You notice details about animations and mobs, the size and proportions of things, it's a completely different world.
---
I barely even play anymore so the topic never came up when I chatted to him.
---
You're just using NCSoft as the boogie man to conceal Anet's own indifference. The banwaves were before the layoffs, and it was a long running problem. They'd launch an automated banwave, Chris Cleary would post mocking tweets to the people he banned, a reddit post would pop up explaining how exactly Anet fucked up, and Chris Cleary would have to delete his tweets. My favorite example was when people were banned for failing the Metrica Province jumping puzzle. They were also told no appeals. That's a stance you can justify taking when you've proven your judgement accurate and reliable. Anet took it because they didn't want to spend money identifying the false positives. It happening once could be a mistake, but the fact that it happened so many times with no change in policy from Anet shows how they really feel. I'm not saying they aren't nice people, but as a company, Anet does only care about your money.
---
They probably did though. And this is the price they came up with for the convenience(eventually) of these, alongside the cost of removing someone completely from the rune/sigil economy going forward. 
---
I wish people would stop comparing just the functional bits with legendary variations, they always have not been worth it if you purely look at function, thats nothing new of these runes and sigils.
---
I gave my experience of meeting people from both companies. That's all.
---
This isn't an issue in raid squads, which *do* have a leader that can freely kick/etc people at a whim. Parties are one thing, but a squad *with a leader* should be invisible and unjoinable to anyone the Commander has blocked.
---
&gt;Anet made all their monetization decisions themselves after HoT - MO proudly announced it.
---
Can you link me to the source for that?
---
For salvaging upgrades, like the BLSK
---
nerf holo
---
First off, how cancerous it is depends on the matchup. I mentioned it being absolutely awful for Necromancer. They can kill you through support with no opportunity to retaliate.
---
Second, this isn't a unique opinion I have. I used to play the game competitively, and the "ex pros" all agree that it's an overpowered build that requires little skill to use. I think the consensus is that the issue is the mantra, not the trait, though, so this is more of a band-aid. That said, it's better than nothing.
---
To me, the clues point to an reworked release of Season 1.
---
I think we can all agree that the game is running
---
Not saying they are running rampant, just using the phrase to emphasize that banning cheaters isnt benevolence on their part. It's in their best interest as well.
---
It would be cool if this is how they always looked. Or maybe this is how it was intended to look?
---
Damn, I actually laughed out loud. That is *exactly* my experience! Hilarious.
---
RIP your QoL though. Come to the Mirage side. Joooiinnnn uuuuussssss.
---
Well.. the engine and the textures are getting a bit long in the teeth. During the coming years, they will have to upgrade the games engine and API (to something newer than DirectX 9 please O.o) if they want to keep this game running instead of going for a Guild Wars 3.
---
SWTOR map breaks are fun too. Check out 'Beyond the walls' series on youtube about it
---
No, it's not the devs. It's the Shareholders and higher-ups for the most part, which tell devs to do these things. Most of the devs expected the reaction that they got, maybe not to the same degree, but at least a good part of it. Regarding Diablo Immortal specifically, it's hard to pinpoint who exactly was at fault, there was certainly a fair share of internal miscommunication which lead the pr team to hype up a new Diablo game ahead of the con. What they should've done was, releasing a small teaser for Diablo 4 after the Diablo Immortal announcement to soften the blow. Why they didnt do that I can only assume, maybe the PR team messed up, maybe they didnt have the time to make a Teaser (those things do take time), maybe Diablo 4 was not ready to be announced, maybe something else entirely.
---
Just à decoration ☹
---
They should try and re-label gw2 as early access... ol' fortnite seems to be pumping out updates quicker that way. Just sayin'.
---
Since I mostly WvW/PvP I can relate. Forever highest FoV.
---
Is this an our of season April fools joke?
---
I don't play PvP, so please don't hesitate to point out flaws in my logic. Does warrior take the Discipline specialization in PvP? If so, they can just use movement skills, which they have plenty of in their arsenal of skill choices. I realize that this is just one profession, but surely Warrior's Sprint counts as counter-play. Even while in Rampage, they have two movement skills. Add in weapon movement skills from both weapon sets, and a movement skill or two in the utility slots, and you should be okay, right?
---
The game is only beautiful when there are no other players around, which is weird for a mmo. All those shiny mount skins, crazy infusions etc. make game look ugly af imo.
---
I mean, it sounds like you don't like the skill because it requires counterplay and some fight awareness?
---
Are u holo main ?
---
I sympathize that you can't control yourself from smashing buttons.
---
Not at all, but even if I were that wouldn't make anything that I said invalid. So I'm not quite sure what your point is
---
The black is scary ._.
---
Oh no , she's necro
---
Hey! New player need help on class selection and inventory management!
---
What are necessary/good classes to have in PvE/meta event/fractals/raid but hard to find one? and what should I do with excess materials? my material bank is full 250/250.
---
Until the inevitable "Why am I still in combat - Oh.  Fleshy's smacking that asura's face."
---
Or if it was another class getting something disabled.  CI is toxic, but c'mon.
---
The latest benchmarks show around 34k dps. What's your problem?
---
After the shitshow on everywhere about the recent balance, I doubt they will now actually give more frequent ones. 
---
Gosh... the System Team whatever tries to do, it causes people to write "I'm quiting" - they showed many times they care about the people's opinions, so prepare for some vague, mediocare balance - because of you, shitposters.
---
Did the same. Was farming for exordium. Sold all the  t6 Mats
---
Chrono, renegade and firebrand. All supports (search builds on snowcrows/discretize/metabattle).
---
You can upgrade material storage or make another character to save extra mats. Alternatively you can sell them on trading post.
---
Player with chest tonic :P
---
It's always hard to notice how big some things actually are with MMO cameras, especially because they do sometimes just make things bigger for visibility.
---
Up in the sky almost fully surrounded by invisible walls
---
Que?
---
Agreed. I just did the Zephyrite kite basket achievement and got to revisit some base game zones and I had honestly forgotten some of the hidden gems found in them as well. I felt truly immersed just flying around with my skyscale, listening to the sounds and enjoying the scenery. 
---
The newer zones, of course, are basically like masterpieces.
---
I did migraine a week ago, didn't get any bugs. Couple of things I've heard (can't confirm if they're true): walk into the drafts that push you up into the air, don't jump into them, and spam space bar during the cut scene. Alternatively, just wait in the shield if you don't need the achievement, and skip the cutscene.
---
Since i took the skyscale i bevete used the gripphon Anymore. I agree that Is boring to collect 250 currencies without alta but really this Is fare from being the worse collection ever.
---
U are trolling
---
Join some guilds!

r/guildrecruitment
---
Community doesnt know what the trait does
---
As much as i hate this holo iteration i have to say that it has more dps than the former version. you can grind it to 33k probably.
---
Gameplay isn't the best for sure. Extended periods of bomb aa.
---
The dungeon armours are really good, mostly. I really don't like the sparklepoo of many of the more recent sets.
---
But they buffed lasers edge and glass canon, how does that result in less dps? I haven't touched holo since the toolbelt patch.
---
In vr? How? Teach me your ways?
---
Hearing minion master just makes me think of GW1 and how much better minions were
---
you could try climbing the 2nd skorvald island with the tree, its pretty hard
---
The 12 blue and 9 green items + 1 level up from those tracks do?
---
Carrots are the worst vegatables.
---
She's just a female dervish which happens to follow the player around since the starter area.
---
As someone who actually played GW1 on the side and entered Kaineng: fuck this shit. That fugly abyss gave me depressions. You spend 80% of your time in that joyless slum. I hope it burned to the ground, actual ashes and charcoal will only improve its sight.
---
This trait has been like that for 6 years and noone gave a fuck. The problem begins when you start abusing the effect with instant AoE CC. You dont even need to pay attention what are you doing because it can randomly interrupt an autoattack and proc CI.
---
I feel old. I remember taking this trait for the interrupt mesmer build back in pre HoT times. That was a hard but rewarding build.
---
Conveniently ignoring mount skin lootboxes, which only were changed because of a massive community outrage, I see. 
---
There is no ignorance here. I've seen worse. Just because even more retardedly overpriced systems exist doesn't mean this one is in any way tame.
---
I reiterate: You're insane. Or just incredibly gambling-addicted.
---
Once you've unlocked all the Zephyrite skins and all the stuff with the Favors of the Festival coupons (in a few years), you'll have at least some chance of getting something good from the event. All the festivals have some sort of reward you can choose, that isn't a one time unlock only and I think it's good.
---
Pongmei valley is THE SHIT. You leave depression behind and the fun part just opens up with one of the most beatiful areas gw has ever made!
---
Try mirage with vita toughness and condi gear with axe torche / axe focus as for the food i took 10% less dmg taken for runs I took earth and sigils meta condi sigils for mirage. I did the hit her with 8 lights with this build. Use jaunt bling and healsigil as utilety and u should be gucci
---
I don't think you know what the word Scam means.
---
[I've played GW1.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/39svmo/gw1_is_hard_mild_spoilers/)
---
It's a different game.
---
It's easy once you get the moonjump buff tho
---
i remember people writing to be disappointed by last years sale in every daily topic, up until last 5 days
---
I love the choya place in the desert Highlands, the floating castle there and the 4th room using the runes to get into room in the dwarth place that also in desert Highlands (reccomend high setting Hehe) its like the bit in Castle in the sky where they was trapped undergroud and the Oldman showed them the sound and light of the stones around them.
---
The hidden groves section is wonderful.
---
The ladyrinthine cliffs where the boat and beach is. I think it's fun and meeting people doing rp stuff on the boat is fun and at some point on the boat ride you look up the sky is very pretty with kites in the air.
---
This might be a bit of a spoiler so heads up
---
The instant that you learn to fight with auren the crystals and land is so pretty. I have some screen shots some where haha
---
I have a female charr necromancer called Umbra Nightseeker :)
---
Dodge jumping into any kind of updraft gives you a pretty high chance to get bugged. So yeah, not jumping at all will probably help with the catapulted into space bug. But its also depended on your ping, I have a friend that still gets catapulted into nothingness on Xera due to her internet connection sometimes. Theres just some things that cant be fixed on arenanets end.
---
Yeah usually if you get anything out of the item you accidentally sold/deleted/salvaged they won't return it. Even if you salvaged a precursor for 3 mithril ore you are shit out of luck 95% of the time sadly.
---
I guess they just wanted to avoid making them large humans... which they kind of are, despite Hulk proportions :/ But yeah that's why I never had a male norn character past a few hours of playtime, they just look so over the top.
---
Thats overly harsh. Arenanet has been fixing old bugs and they've been over the last HoT storyinstance a couple of times, fixing 'break progress' bugs. 
---
Also, if you take a look at arenanet open jobs, they are short a couple of programmers, which is the kind of devs you need to really fix things fast. Not saying the currently employed devs dont do anything, but it takes them longer and its more patchwork instead of real fixes.
---
Yea that shit turns me on , makes pvp really worthwhile
---
Exactly. I like customization, but a pink haired charr with sixteen different auras and glowing eyes, mounted on a electric raptor is too much. Arah armor and ascalon catacombs weapons are an example of a fantasy like equipment that still fit the world very well and doesn't ruin the immersion. Outfits are the worst tho. On top of being completely out of place most of the times, they also completely destroy the fashion game which is the real gw2 endgame according to most players
---
It does, for two hours every four months
---
Yeah, even most sophisticated ones like arah or cof still fit the world perfectly
---
You might want to actually read the pages you listed first...
---
Those are two different containers with the first one being the one you get from the repeatable reward track and the second one being the one OP showed.
---
[1](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Zephyrite_Curio_Box): "This article is about the container given as a final reward for the Festival of the Four Winds Reward Track. For the container that can be selected from the Blessing of the Four Winds, see Zephyrite Curio Box (rare)."

---
Stepping out of the starter town on Shing Jea island and looking down across the lush valley to the temples off in the distance was just such an experience (Shing Jea in general was just gorgeous), along with some of the missions inside the big temples in Kaineng, made a big impression on me. I was homebound at the time and extremely UV sensitive, and being in that beautiful environment just made me feel so much *better*. The armor skins were solid, meeting the Kirin was awesome, etc. The expansion had a lot of mood. It was my personal favorite because they just set the atmosphere and the environments, especially at the time, so well.  
---
I really wish they'd bring it back. It's been one of my biggest disappointments with GW2, especially since they told us we'd be getting basically the same game but with better movement abilities and engine flexibility. But Kryta lost its very ancient greek/mediterranean feel (lots of palms and tropicals and water), and we lost Cantha completely.  
---
So in my case it's nostalgia, but I wouldn't be nostalgic for it if they hadn't designed it so beautifully.  
---
I don't see why it's a problem, considering that Elona is a mix of African cultures (including Egypt) and Asian cultures (India), and Kryta is a mix of western cultures. It was asian-influenced without imo being weaboo or anime.
---
Spirits have way more health. Flux bombs just strike summons for the full damage instead of 5%. They kill kalla spirits aswell.
---
Function gyro dies to one downed aa in pvp aswell. It's probably bugged because this can't be intended. Will probably get fixed with the 3rd scrapper rework.
---
Yeah, I was in FA all the time, it was really well-designed. Luxon side was a really nice challenge as a healer, since you needed to keep both your side AND the siege turtles alive while the Kurzicks could just stand above and pewpew.
---
I don't think that argument applies here. Obviously bots can perfectly interrupt everything because they aren't human. It's not an issue of too simple or not.
---
This trait has been around for a very long time with not much issue. Perhaps it's not the trait that's the problem?
---
Nope. This game looks exactly as dated, as it is. If you wanna see a beautiful game, look to the Witcher 3 for example or Black Dieser Online even if it is a horrible game.
---
Every time i read something like this it just serves to remind me of how bad this balance team is how dysfunctional management is for not tearing it down and rebuilding it with people who are actually trying to get shit right. This team is wholly unprofessional and their biased towards certain classes has been an issue for what seems like forever.
---
Hire some new staff for balance and get a lead that has a the best interest of the game and not his tiny circle of friends!
---
Dragonfall mini* but yeah
---
The dx12 patch somehow worsen my performance
---
Nah it's in French, maybe Micromania ?
---
I see a mix of everything, some really cool ones, some neat cosplays of characters from other games, and then of course all the people who do absurdly colorful fairy princess stuff.
---
I like my necro's autumn/orchid/gold theme. Just wish I had the dye unlocked for that gold color around her neck from the carapace armor.
---
Nostalgia goggles and nothing else. People also want to believe they will experience similar feelings they did during Factions. They won't.
---
&gt; [Mini Bone Soldier](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Bone_Soldier)
---
Neat. Explains why I couldn't find it.
---
Reminds me of that one person who bought all the Crab Meat on the trading post. Unfortunately I can't remember his name.
---
Harder to maintain though since they had their health constantly draining. GW2 MM is definitely easier but I like it a lot.
---
Thought I picked a great color scheme for my sylvari necro when I first made her. Wanted her to look basically undead
---
I looked at the skins and even stopped after unlocking 2 of them because they are mostly ugly in my view. The entire event is getting old.
---
During the recording of this, the prize of Endless Karka tonics on the TP actually went up :p
---
This ❤️🙌
---
Damn, so much fun.
---
Rampage is pretty broken but at least it's power damage so you can dodge/block it. Anything egregious that has to do with conditions is super bad for player enjoyment. I'm an ele main and have been since day 1 lol
---
It's whoever is the farthest person from Samarog after the breakbar is finished.

i think the disconnect during mordy's death is a connections thing. It happens when you don't have a very stable internet. As in there is a lag between when your pc's request of "send me the cut screen date" arrives and when the server thinks "Oh he disconnected because i'm not receiving the request for the next step. " At which point you get soft disconnected which sends you back to char select and thus out of the instance. This might also explain your flying bug.
---
Where the server response and your pc info of your location are not synced up and so the game responds to late with the gravity function. Yes that is a real thing that has to respond else you just keep going up. so a late response means you hit the top of the "you're allowed here" area first before the gravity function activates. and then the game says "Nope, not allowed here!" and you get kicked out. Might even explain Canach because his response messages get mixed up.
---
Every game has pvp salt lol I usually only do pvp cuz one win is all it takes to do all the daily challenges in one match. I tried WvW but solo it was confusing. PvE exploration, story, dungeons, and fractals are where this game really shines and since I started a couple months ago I don't anticipate a content drought anytime soon for me
---
Whenever a stun ends the new target/tank is the person furthest away at that point in time.
---
Good groups stack on him, thus letting specific people claim tank.
---
Basically, if you don't want tank, stay close.
---
When a Mirage dropped Chaos Storm on you with CI, and properly used the daze mantra, you were immobilized **and** dazed for \~5 seconds straight, with both being reapplied every 0.5s. The only thing Warrior had against it was to get stability via rampage and leap out, otherwise you're fucked even with 20k extra health. 
---
Classes with no mobility like Scourge got absolutely destroyed, they couldn't cast anything other than shade skills for a full 5 seconds and even shade skills would do nothing except cleanse (which would get reapplied in .5 seconds) or fear/desert shroud, which would do nothing as the mirage is evading for 90% of this combo. It was unfun, there was no counterplay, and it was compounding problems on a class that is *already* obnoxious.
---
Mirage **without** CI is still obnoxious and not a fun build to play against. Warrior without Rampage is healthy, has lots of counterplay, and takes skill to learn and play. Both CI and Rampage are bad, but CI is far worse for player enjoyment and balance as far as counterplay and feeling like you're doing something/can do something.
---
unfortunately this is a bug that A-net actually can't code away because its caused by your ISP, not the game. And sometimes its not even your ISP, but an internet node through which your data has to travel due to your country or location.
---
Yeah it was! It opened up so many more possibilities :)
---
Isn't that because it's close to your current level range?
---
Last i checked, chrono has access to normal shatters when executioner's axe is used.
---
**CONTENT**.  I mean this in the best way possible.
---
Exactly. From that moment on I just committed to being a super adventure box glam kid
---
use it for stab or superspeed with trait instead?
---
There is a skeleton mini that's green at night, I can't remember which one it is but it's been on my necro forever
---
Pretty sure they were being sarcastic.
---
I recall not liking factions pve at all. Y'all remember that early mission in the story that had half of the gw1 population stuck there because it was too hard? That shit was hilarious
---
Tell that to ANet.
---
I don't think I'll pre-order any GW expansion anymore until I know for sure what it's like. HoT was a huge disappointment and PoF has honestly not been too much better.
---
It also kinda came out when F2P games were 'the thing' back then. It sure didn't help its case.
---
Allllll about the fun you have. One thing I'll mention is check out too tier armor sets for light/medium/heavy. Given the endgame is Fashion here, you wanna love what your character does. 
---
Anything can be good if you're good with it, but as a warrior main I cant love any class as much as my war. Simple, badass, and always viable in all game modes.
---
By fix you mean they'll probably just remove that trait and make it something stupid.
---
GW1's original engine could not properly showcase Cantha.
---
But GW2's improved engine can.
---
In GW1 we could see endless green and blue shores, towering cliffs, giant skyscrapers, stacked slums far up pat the eye can see, forest full of giant trees and an endless ocean.  
---
But we could not really explore it. We would walk next to all these things, and look at them, but we didn't really get to experience it. Most of it was out of reach and on the edges of the walkable areas.
---
In GW2's engine, we could swim in those shores, fly down those cliffs, scale up those skyscrappers, fly up to those stacked slums, climb those trees, and dive down in the Jade Ocean now that it is no longer solid.
---
Because meta has been changing, lots of non-mesmer builds have been nerfed, so it stands to reason some builds will once again resurface.

It's only been years. I'm sure some day.

Mobile might be the most profitable market in existence, but it does not overlap with the core market for guild wars 2.

And I'm so glad they were because sylvari are my favorite fantasy race ever.

Idl what's it called but I like the small town in queensdale with a bank.
---
The evolving art style is one of the things that drove me from the game.
---
I don't want to play an anime game where people run around with glowing pauldrons the size of a small car.
---
I now play ESO and the armours are much more grounded in reality (as far as a fantasy armour goes).
---
Cursed Shore is level 80, and Malchor's Leap goes up to 80 so it wouldn't be green. It seems that Straits of Devastation is the only area that is level 75 so its the only one close enough to 80 to be green.
---
The journey has been so long... We forgot where we came from...

I don't get it either. Granted I live in vegas, but people having dyed hair (and working normal jobs) is extremely normal here and not really a sign of anything. Heck, even I wear pink wigs when I want to have hair (I have alopecia) and get nothing but compliments.

Minions get rekt in fractals aswell ??
---
\&gt; No? What the fuck are you on about? I'm just suggesting he avoid useless  weapons else he be dissapointed when he reaches endgame and no party  will take his greatsword mesmer in raids. 
---
To confirm, you think he's incredibly motivated to be good (which apparently I'm too hypercasual to understand) but is also crippled by his inability to learn how to use multiple weapon sets? Amazing.
---
\&gt;  Just because this game might have taken you 6 months to learn before you  stopped running around in shit gear and did something half-decent,  doesn't mean everyone else learns as slow as you 
---
This is great, you're forced to use personal attacks because your argument doesn't work unless I'm some hypercasual. 
---
\&gt;  He has a clear endgoal - It's raids, with a greatsword. Stop wasting his time.
---
No, his endgoal is just to use greatsword in "endgame". He looked at raid guides because they're easy to find. He also said that hammer looks cool on scrapper but read that the turrets suck, so he won't use them. Clearly, it would be better if he spent some time learning basics of games and classes rather than only using greatsword because he only wants to use it, which isn't really something he should be doing in endgame content (using only 1 weapon type).
---
\&gt;  I'm sorry that it offends you that he didn't join with a casual frame of mind but he didn't, so deal with it.
---
Wanting to use a single weapon type is a casual frame of mind :)
---
She is the ruler of the dominant human kingdom, she can wear whatever she wants.

Soloq FB - symbolbrand - uses Zeal. Mainly for the ridiculous damage multipliers for symbols.

But I agree Shattered Aegis is bad...

That was detailed and exactly what I wanted to know. TY. that sounds so cool and I regret not joining gw2 sooner. hopefully Ill find nice people to play with. Im taking a break from League of Legends and Ive had enough of people telling me to kms for the rest of the year.

How are you getting 95% damage reduction?
---
My favorite is Butcher's Block the little camp celebrating Meatoberfest.  It seems so alive with all the voice acting and that drunk charr running around challenging people lol.
---
It was an extraordinary experienced. A top notch campaign for GW1. We want it back for GW2.
---
Well, that was amazing.

Is it just the Minstrel focus that's an instrument?

Think of it as a Personal Investment, I'm guessing he doesn't want to Invest his time or his money unless he will have a return on that investment in New Content or an overall improvement to game systems.

Not all investments are in shares, you can switch out the term for something more suited, such Waste my Time or Money.

For the AP.

Verdarach too.

Not that many pug map queues in t1

Better UI/UX is a must for GW2. This rough draft is definitely a step in the right direction.

I didn't know what that word meant, now I do, thanks for that.

---
Why did you link the same page twice?
---
anyone know if the jump into the chak pit and kill them achievement is still bugged? I've done it over 5 times and it still remain the only achievement i don't have in TD story.
---
wait. have you really been playing for 7 years?! I dont think ill ever catch up :/
---
You should repost this btw. And get a better highlight in community without mods being a total dick and removing gw2bot community shitting and lying around.
---
Hi just wanted to let you know I also downvoted you for literally no reason.
---
Always had great customer support from ArenaNet - even when the issues were entirely user-generated.
---
I never did play CI, because I barely PvP. But I don't see other BS classes getting an entire GM trait disabled cause of bad whiney players.
---
I personally don't think this build is very good but, it does look fun to play.
---
Warrior's Sprint is a super good trait, but it only works for breaking immobs. The situation I'm talking about is necromancers corrupting the pulsing stability given by Rampage into Fear. During Rampage, the warrior has no access to utilities, so he has no way of dealing with conditions directly, which gives the necromancer the upper hand most of the time.
---
That is frustration, and I don't think they would spend so much time arguing if they weren't atleast invested in the game
---
It'd make more sense if they could avoid these type of tickets by allowing us to salvage these items back into their material form..
---
After she got fired, she immediately went to go shit talk the company on tons of article websites.
---
She's a horrible person, and I wouldn't take what she says with anything more than a grain of salt.
---
Be a shame if anybody outside of WvW knew what the fuck stability was.
---
Instead of asking so many foolish questions how about you guys try the bot first? Lmao.
---
Thank you :)
---
From my understanding, after PoF's latest powercreep elite specs, Mirages were broken for a long time, though Chronomancers were also still used. Chronomancers got their shatters gutted in the recent patches, and Mirages received a slew of nerfs (most of them were probably justified in that case though). So it would seem that people are now jumping to a build focused around Mantra of Distraction and Chaotic Interruption.
---
Well, 95% reduced duration is essentially the same as 95% reduced incoming condition damage as far as the damaging conditions are concerned. Having lower duration instead of lower damage takes the same damage reduction but allows it to apply to Cripple, Chill, and Immob as well, like you said. I think the only condition that would not truly be 95% less effective with shorter duration vs damage would be Confusion, as the big hit from activating an ability would still go through even with 5% normal duration.
---
What passive boss damage auras are you referring to?
---
Thats sword. Was talking about rifle.
---
O thought some people used it on gors for those spirits as well. I haven't raided in a while though but I still hope it gets fixed. Overpowered skills are one thing but skills that can instantly down you are another.
---
Holo was at 31.6k before which was below reaper. You can grind the rifle pbm version to like 33k now, maybe higher. Its a straight number buff but the gameplay suffered a lot.
---
Yeah for stuff that can be worth well over 10k not being able to preview them is just bad. They are comparable to legendaries which can be previewed
---
Thanks!
---
wtf happened to this comment?
---
Holding spacebar deploys glider the instant doing so is possible.

Btw:) Can you give advise about gold farming? Currently doing daily. Found guide that I can earn 2g by defeating  Tequatl the Sunless world boss, but got only 1 mb they changed it. or I need to find another boss?

I'm now lvl 32 and apart from one dungeon I never had to group up or talk to anyone. Is this gw2 in disguise?

&gt;	Also, if you take a look at arenanet open jobs, they are short a couple of programmers
---
Hmm. If only they hadn't laid off a fourth of their developers earlier this year.
---
Ranger pets would like to have a word with ya :P
---
Same applies to the color of the level on NPCs.
---
I don't think anyone is legitimately expecting that.
---
We've been congratulating them on the artwork since day 1, and complaining about the time/reward balance, and content since day 2.
---
They know, and choose to do nothing about it.
---
Anet seems to have a high opinion as to the re-playability of the content, and it's one that many of us don't share. The game has come down to Farm Wars and Fashion Wars.
---
The community also keeps telling people that if they don't like it, they should leave. And so people have left the game.
---
I'm pretty sure the HoT maps gave me Rabies.
---
The devs are useless PvP focused negligent amoebas. Virtually all they design for classes even before the release of an xpac is gimmicks with PvP in mind. It was very telling when the beta weekend for PoF was for PvP first and for the "PvE" one it was largely limited so no serious testing or feedback was done for modifications before release.

After years of playing Path of Exile I have given up on expecting people to know what the word "scam" actually means. :/
---
I haven’t played FFXIV, so I wasn’t aware. I guess that nuances my statement somewhat then. Still would like to see more dev love for WvW :)
---
 I think that's a bad idea because a lot of people go to WvW just because of the gift of battle. It would definitely lower the WvW population even further. I for one would like to keep that mode strong as possible so it gets some reform.
---
Every raid boss pulses damage to the entire arena every few seconds. One pulse is enough to kill your function gyro before it can actually start resurrecting someone.
---
You at least get a Mystic coin for the daily. ;)
---
I wasn’t idolizing pre-HoT era. I was talking about the time period between HoT release and LWS3. 
---
I’m well aware people were complaining both pre and post HoT, but the content released with and after HoT had way more replay value and longlivity compared to the content released recently.
---
Because it’s a solid argument. Yes the devs do come to reddit and take the constructive criticism. You’re playing a free game that lives off the gem shop. The devs of the game do their best. If it’s not good enough, mayhap you just find a new mmo. I’ve recently migrated to ffxiv, and although it’s not as visually appealing, if it’s story you want, I highly recommend it.
---
I live in an apartment building. I'm fairly sure our wiring was designed by a squirrel with slightly above-average intelligence. I only play GW2 when our neighbors are out, because when enough people use the internet it tends to randomly drop connection. Comcast thinks there's nothing wrong, of course, and since they have an agreement with the local government other ISPs are not allowed in the area.
---
A return of a bomb or grenade Engi in PvP would be too amazing to become reality
---
&gt;  don't even do any animations for attacking, for like 3 seconds straight.
---
That sounds like every single MMO Ive ever played. Ever. WoW. Gw1, Lineage 2, a bunch of Korean MMOs, Aion, ESO.... 
---
The player is always and will always be inherently powerful in any open world content. Always. In any game. Not just MMOs. Thats just how it is.
---
I could also list you a number of things, where I think Gw2 lacks in terms of accessability.
---
Navigation (to places you have been before)
---
Jumping puzzles (clear communication of where you can and can't stand. Compare GW2 communication of areas where you can jump to and stand on to games, which really get this right. Nintendo's Mario come to mind, but also Tomb Raider)
---
Information about recipes
---
Changing builds
---
Information about how deadly zones and stacked zones are. 
---
Information, clear display about who is in my squad subgroup. 
---
The recharge systematic of powers is not unified. Powers of different weapons in the same slot do not share CD, if it's the same weapon type they doch, recharge of utilities in the same slot share CD.
---
Which powers can reach onto a wall or through a gate. All these little details about how powers work, you end up having to memorize. 
---
The amount of time I have to spend outside the game to look into the wiki and /or guides clearly shows, that the game has a problem with accessability and could need great improvements. 
---
One thing that shows the problems really well is the current UI for legendary runes and sigils. Things like these are symptomatic for this game. 
---
I could go on for ages. Note: all these little things do not make GW2 a bad game, it's IMO the best MMO currently available. More thought into design patterns however could lead to an even better and more easily accessible experience.
---
Thats only in PvE.... they never impletmented that damage reduction in PvP or WvW.
---
What is your main? I feel like these may be a bit biased 😅
---
I honestly wish it was feasible for a super casual to have their own guild hall + bank.
---
Wow, that's quality content!
---
Subscribed.
---
So... news with heresay and no facts.
---
Switching mounts is pretty painless compared to most games. If there's anything they nailed about mounts, it's how convenient they are and how good they feel to use.
---
Haha, nice. Added to my collection.
---
Just disable whole chaos trait line, game would be better for it.
---
Is this an out of season April Fools joke? Even with the springer mount there is hardly any platforming that is mandatory. Most of the springer mount jumps are 100% VERTICAL not horizontal and long jumps with the raptor are so easy to pull off that if you miss then you have to be some sort of idiot that cant aim the camera straight.
---
If anything mounts make this game super easy, barely an inconvinience.
---
Turning on map rotation has really helped me get past that "I'm bored with this area" feeling - I found that I was looking at the minimap for where I was instead of my surroundings, and it was making me miss some of the coolest sights. Letting the map rotate let me actually use the terrain to navigate more.
---
I don't think you know what a platformer is. Hopping on the raptor to leap across a chasm has nothing to do with that.
---
And stuff being locked behind masteries is by design, it's Anet's take on 'metroidvania' gameplay where you see parts of the map that are not yet accessible to you, but will be, once you progress further into the game and gain additional skills. They've been doing that since five years. Since HoT.
---
Factions was peak GW1. Maybe there's a chance that 'Factions 2' could be peak GW2?
---
This subreddit is the worst, players are totally unfriendly, downvote for no reason like a hivemind and the mods censor.
---
Lol, agree, this guy is just an idiot.
---
It was more the double chaos storm than just the mantra.
---
&gt; where is all the sudden blue/pink hair hate coming from?  
---
The hate basically started once it became popular. Nothing new. People hate popular things.
---
No it's childish and show lack of actual arguments. I have zero knowledge on how to make a game, but I paid for it. I pre order the game back in 2011, bought both xpacs and threw a decent load on gem store as well. I'm not here to make the game, I'm here to enjoy. I work in a high class hotel, people spend thousands of euros to stay a few nights. If something is wrong, I don't tell them to build their own hotel or go spend their time at their home, we try to find a solution. And it works like that for every industry, including videogames. Yeah, switching games in a good argument,but the "go to anet and make a better game" is dumb as shit

Lol in order to release a mobile version of the game they would actually need to work on the game engine first, I can't see the mess that's GW2 on PC working on mobiles atm

"I made a bunch of crappy pepe the frog memes..."  
---
There are other kinds of pepe the frog memes?
---
I dunno, GW2 feels very video-gamey. I can't say I'm ever particularly immersed while playing it. As far as MMOs go, I only get that feeling from stuff like classic EQ1 and maybe vanilla WoW. And both of those look and sound like shit. In terms of immersion, to me it's more important to have a big, hostile, open world that tells you to figure things out for yourself. 
---
Meanwhile in GW2 I'm hitting a load screen to teleport to a new video game waypoint every 2 minutes so that I can do my video game dailies or hit up the next generic Ubisoft open world map point for 100% completion or whatever.

when you have reached max MF, it should unlock a reward track were you can indefenetly get things. maybe some hilarious titles etc.

Asuran Tech combined with Zephyrite magic refined by a human. But yeah, generally engineer is more Charr than Asura. Asura do have the elixir and other alchemy-related aspects, but most of the tech is charr engineering.

Kurzicks were literally Germanic Gothic, which doesn't actually have anything to do with modern "goth" culture or being edgy any more than any of the world's most famous cathedrals have anything to do with modern goth culture..  They were highly religious and structured while the Luxons were highly trade focused nomads.  They were definitely the more snooty of the two groups, though.
---
(cranky old man voice) in my day we couldn't land on that last bit, we had to go full Independence Day on that, full speed, butt clenched the entire way.  getting gold on that meant that you were a real pilot.
---
all honesty though, still the most satisfying gold i've gotten on a griffon course.  spent hours last year getting that last part right.
---
As a counter to this, I feel like in a world where all of this magic and Asura tech exists, plenty of people would figure out how to dye their hair pink and make their skin glow, since... That's pretty much what happened in real life.
---
One thing that's a bit jarring but actually kind of cool about GW2 is that there is a *lot* of messy cultural mixing between the races. In another game, every race would play straight to stereotype, but in GW2, *of course* some Norn are gonna decide that bashing holographic dragons is fun, and *of course* the Asura are going to market that. And you even have some Norn who are disgusted by the whole thing.
---
Don't tell me plenty of people wouldn't make their skin into stars if it was easy to do it with magic. Of course they would, and it would be mostly teenagers and it would be obnoxious. That's immersive.
---
Don't get me wrong, I actually prefer the more traditional fantasy aesthetics, but I do think what Anet has done isn't particularly unrealistic. Case in point: they offer both types of aesthetic in the game, but what does everyone buy? Now, why would Tyrians be so different from us?
---
I mean, China was the market they were pitching it to, but actually many of the Asian cultures hate that kind of cultural mixing... largely because at one point or another each one was a tyrannical invader over another some time in history.  There's a lot of bad blood in Asia.
---
[Level range coloring](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/players/Level-colour/page/1#post4647939)
---
I think it's colored based on the highest level of the zone, as the lowest and average levels would both make it gray. This also explains why Malchor's is white; its highest level is 80, and its lowest and average levels would make it greenish white.
---
You don't have to play that way though. When I'm craving some immersion, I deliberately avoid using waypoints, put my headphones on, zoom my camera in somewhat, and then I just run around exploring. It can be incredibly immersive. Who cares about dailies?
---
Where are the mods? This doesn't need to be a post. No one cares about your banned account unless you can prove it was because of some obscure reason that the community should be aware of.
---
Im brazilian, and there isnt a single guild on EU from what Ive searched, so I was gonna swap mostly to play with other brazilians (because they all seem to flock on NA), how is the open pve? Its what I mostly play, like world bosses and hot/pof metas, achievements, etc. And sometimes (rarely) fractals and wvw
---
Rytlock's hat was gay. So what?
---
The main reason I'm angry is that there is no credit given and the post implies that they're all original ideas, as well as the obviously inflammatory title, which sadly seems to have worked on me.
---
I assume you mean  Nahpui Quarter?  The quest to become Weh no Su?  A lot of people had no idea what they were doing on that one.
---
Asking the true questions!!!
---
ah, when you have friends from your country it shouldnt be a problem. especially not for open world stuff
---
Not sure "charr" and "green fields" fit together. It's likely Saruman's \*ahem\* whoops I mean charrs' boner for industry have turned it into Ascalon 2.0
---
I'm not disagreeing with you, but between the first person camera (that actually functions well, unlike GW2s), the relatively realistic artstyle, and particle effects that aren't super obnoxious, the game was undeniably *more immersive* than GW2. Even if its less fun and interesting.
---
And this topic is about the games immersion.
---
I dragged it out for as long as I could, but in 2019 I finally capped on luck. Now I suffer the same fate as the rest of you. So many stacks of exotic luck. A luck reward track would be fucking amazing. So far it's Poobadoo or whatever and his luck bukkake during the chinese festival.
---
so they are still using gw2 resources to look into mobile development? i thought we were passed this...
---
Wasn't the other recent thing item destruction not duplication?
---
NA and EU are still separate data centers and can't play together in any way.  They can chat and share TP because those are both separate systems I guess.
---
Gw2 has no challenging pve content outside of raids and fractals, and speedrunning dungeons. That is a fact, and there are far fewer raids in this game than other similar titles. It would be nice if the primary gameplay the game promoted required you to learn how to play.
---
But you can turn off the hud
---
There are tons of insanely broken things in PvP, some way worse than CI (Scourge and Firebrand existing is a sin imo) but CI wasn't just strong, it had very little counterplay and was **never fun** to play against. You got caught in chaos storm and you were locked out of moving or using skills for 5+ seconds. If the content creators that do nothing except PvP all day claim that it was bad for the gamemode, I'm inclined to believe them.
---
The only thing that frustrates me about this box is:   
---
Last year I got the sun gloves. I thought, "ok this year it will be easy to get another of the trio, right?"  
---
Nope. Do dailies for a few days, ignore any zephyrite weapon skins you might want, select the box, and HAVE A CHANCE to drop one of the gloves.  
---
What's so wrong with wanting to select my prize? I don't even care for the infusions.
---
Because he is not that guy that spoil things. He know a lot more then he tells but he tells when Arena Net are ready to ship. If you want more info you have to wait until 30 th august. that_shaman is not gonna tell you about it. Amd imo i think he is handling it very well and that is why he also is very respected by the comunity.
---
Why sell when you can hoard.
---
I keep my hopes high that Anet wont drop us some mobile bs, it would be dumb asf
---
that's fucking stupid m8
---
..and you get that from?
---
Dailies are good. Start leveling working on fractals so you can do fractal dailies. And if you want a farm there’s silverwastes farm and Dragonfall farm. You can google those and find good guides.
---
Your complaint totally is about the character, though. They're talking to *each other* as opposed to *you*. There's some crazy dude on this sub who has recorded video+audio of all the ambient conversations and stories in major zones/hubs that have slices of life from people inhabiting this world beyond your personal interaction with them.
---
When you're in the open world, most times you're just a random person who showed up there as opposed to being the commander. They have nothing to say to you unless it's something you're engaging in personally (like an event, adventure, race, etc). 
---
Did you just want a completely static world that only shifts in any way when you want it to?
---
Imo start a f2p account on NA and see if it works for you. Maybey ou want to have accounts on both EU and NA (many do have this) and always have activity. Sometimes there are sales and i guess one should come up soonish and then you can add expacs as well if you want to play more. 
---
Or play on the f2p account and see if it works for you and then move your main account if it does.
---
To back this up, Star Trek Online had a decent amount of data mining going on years ago. They didn't leak much story content but leaked new gear and ships that were coming, which as a byproduct pretty much leaked the story too. Cryptic cracked down hard and actually banned some of these data mining fleets and people from the game and even got the subreddit to ban data mining posts.
---
We are lucky we get what we do from Shaman and he only leaks stuff that's a week or two away usually. That's why ANet is okay with him. If he starts leaking stuff from months away or major story things I have no doubt they would crack down and ask us mods to remove his posts.
---
I played for over a year and got 9 level 80 characters of each class with both elite specs unlocked, and even got 6 of them set up in raid-ready builds with full ascended gear before finally settling on Guardian as my first choice for raids, fractals, PvP, and even open world. You can take your time, try out many classes, and get a sense of what you enjoy before settling on a main.
---
Isn't enough for most players because it's... Just not enough. You can expect an mmorpg to live off a 2h story quest every 4 months. The only way the community can help is with proper communication. And guess who's the absolute worst at communicating with the players?
---
But you have weapon swaps, class skill F1- 10 weapon skills (unless you are ele then 20 and engineer, well i lost count), Build traits that procs if you do this or that. Runes and sigils that procs if you do this and that. And then 5 more skills on your right bar and on top of that, boon play and on top of all that combofileds that you either place your self or use others who placed something. 
---
I mean you can go from being nearly dead and you see a waterfield a head that someone in wvw dropped you charge in to it and blast and bam you now are nearly full hp just because you used a combofield. 
---
There is just a endless way of bending combat if you really understand how to use your profession and how others are using it on you.
---
As for Cholormancer which i also played in RIFT i wish they would make the next ele elite spec as chloro. That would make me so happy. Healing through damage. But ele can still be played as both dps and support or all together depending on the situation.

Most of the festivals have some crazy item to craft. What if lunar new year gives us an item that comes with a gobbler.  When t consumes luck it grants you a temporary buff that's equivalent to the lunar new year buff. This means that fireworks etc that have bonus effects can have those buffs all year round but requires a luck sink
---
The worse part was the clicking..
---
But yeah, all that efford for such small money was painful, like when I used the karma\gold method pre hot [getting tons and tons of blue\green stuff from hearts vendors, tossing into the MF and salvaging the results]
---
Yeah thats a good idea to try it first on a f2p, ty
---
There's many "packages" but Anet couldn't bring themselves to make Brahams package
---
They usually do this stuff at the end. I think if you bought slots at the start you would be less likely to spend more later in the month.
---
&gt; This game was supposed to be THE WoW killer
---
No it wasn’t. It never aimed to be that.
---
That one guy who tried to deposit a home instance node in the guildbank by double clicking it
---
Dhuum normal mode is a fight with important, punishing mechanics that must be done or else everyone dies. Many of the mechanics cannot be offloaded onto the chronos or healers, so everyone has to pay attention. It's this "small individual mistakes cause everyone to die" that makes the fight hard. 
---
Dhuum CM adds yet another punishing mechanic that affects everyone, turning the difficulty up yet another notch.
---
Yah neat, doesnt change the fact that I hit the nail on the head.
---
Those issues particularly lower the replay value of older maps, especially with newer mechanics like gliding, the griffon, and the skyscale making them much more likely for players to encounter. Stops the immersion cold.
---
Some people never develop object permanence. As soon as the Ender's Echo leaves their sight they forget it exists. It's hard to have a run where at least a couple people don't get picked up on top of the additional challenges presented by the CM.
---
So the only reason you were having fun was because you were playing something broken and obnoxious?
---
Part of the reason I’ve moved on from gw2 :(
---
Should I be playing with autotargeting on or off?
---
And that might actually be vaguely worthwhile if you didn't have to click a bazillion times to get it.
---
Also, if you have a stackable item to deposit, you currently can't add it to a stack that's already present. Substantially annoying.
---
I love this game to death, its my main mmo. But I started playing FFXIV and FOR ME its waaaaaaay more immersive than gw2 for several reasons.
---
Guild Wars 2 has 4 major servers.
---
* Login Server    
---
* Web Server hosting Trading Post    
---
* North American Game Data    
---
* European Game Data
---
**Social Functions piggyback on the login server.**
---
The login server is shared for everyone, after which they are redirected to the appropriate game server. Anything social will work cross region. By social, I mean Mail, Chat, Guilds, Friends List, etc. 
---
The TP is also a separate thing and is actually a website (The TP window is an embedded web browser. Seriously.) You can even access it out of game, though you can't actually *do* anything with it. This is shared too.
---
Everything else is separate. You can't play together cross region at all. No PvP. No Dungeons. No ppen world. The maps and instances are running in a different physical location.
---
Nostalgia boner.
---
I would like to know more about targeting too. I am new to the game (about 2 months) and this still feels totally broken to me. I have tried all different settings and nothing feels right. For some reason the game insists on choosing things that are out of range instead of what is right on top of me hitting me....
---
And don't get me started on meta events or world bosses where you get interrupted/stunned/whatever and lost the target only to have to try and manually click through a bazillion players/pets/turrets etc.
---
It just all feels wrong to me. I am wondering if it's how my settings are or if it's just how the game is.
---
Every time they nerf mesmer it becomes worser. And I can´t, but sigh, for my first and favorite profession becoming unplayable in every goddamn mode. Should I play thief to have a non-castrated version of the portal in PvP? Should I play FB to have a slot in Fractals? Why do I need the whole mesmer thing in general?
---
Gonna be honest, I just made a macro to dump all my luck.

Speaking of function gyro's, been doing spvp for a few weeks now, and its absolute garbage.   Like the OP said, its rarely used on more than one target.  The cast time is ludicrous considering it also takes a while to actually pulse, and the fact of the matter it is unless you sit there and watch the animation and bar finish, which leaves you ubelievably vulnerable even if you are running around, its incredibly easy to cut short, and you just wasted all that time.
---
yw
---
Agreed.
---
The most immersive part is how everything and everyone wants money and getting rich mean you're more powerful.
---
Otherwise, immersive with glowing wings, shiny effects, eye melting lights ? Meh
---
don't trust what JP says, when she isn't flat out lying she's twisting the truth to make it seem far worse then it actually is.
---
i don't exactly know where i got this from but anet has the story prepared well in advance (the mayor story beats at least) and they've got "ending" in the story so they could deliver a "satisfying ending" in case the game got shut down because alot of things could happen in the future (or in other words: this has nothing to do with the canceled projects) but also can continue the story if everything stays as planned. and the ending of season 4 was such an "ending".
---
(note again i don't know where i got this from so take it with a grain of salt and if anybody can tell me the source that'd be great)
---
There is so much to speculate but in the end we will propably never know, especially how big of a role NCsoft is in Anet not going for expansion 3. I refuse to believe Anet wanted to go with a free to play season 5 instead of getting big cash and big publicity with another expansion.
---
It's a template for all cases, not just for when everything is legendary and none of your choices are final
---
That episode felt extremely disconnected from the rest, especially the ending. Oh, we're going to Elona.
---
    if(!legendary) {displayPrompt()}
---
Why don’t we just wait for August 30 instead of panicking every other day?
---
Especially since (correct me if I'm wrong there) you can change stats whenever you want anyway, so even if it was a mistake, you could just switch it back to what you actually wanted.
---
I mean, to say it flows is... not really accurate. Episode 5 ended with Balthazar escaping which could have led quite naturally into PoF, but then episode 6 basically has you dancing around doing completely random things until an NPC goes "Balthazar is in Elona lol bye".
---
It's almost worse than confirming gear repairing window when interacting with anvil.
---
Well you are working on the collection, you need it for Lover and Kudzu, but unless you complete both you can pick it up. It's a regular exotic item, there are a bunch of those that are only used for collections. Sell value is the good ol 2.64s. Best part is though, you can only pick it up once a day, so I'm really really curious why it got disabled almost 4 years after the legendary collections got released.
---
It's almost as if she wasn't lying.
---
the update is a dumpster fire. runes don't work properly, recipes are unbalanced, it's clunky AF, and it doesn't take much to realize that even the visual UI design is a complete clusterfuck.
---
Oh that's quite a bit more than I thought, thanks. But , yeah , I heard it's a shit-load of clicking ( as several people have lamented below).
---
0 "effective" in my newbish opinion. Animation is slow and then 30 sec cooldown. The gs swing often overextends too and rarely hits for anything. Rifle is so bad tho. Warriors have no strong ranged option..
---
&gt;I like how  monetization  has become the norm to people. This is the problem. Its why games are getting worse and not better, locking everything behind paywalls leaves a desolate game world. Nothing new or as little as they can possibly get by with, goes into games. Personally i prefer wow, its a far better game with a huge amount of story. But after 12 years i needed a break.
---
Speak for yourself...I never called them quests. lol  Actually hearts I'm really not a fan of hearts and never have been.  
---
In the end game zones from the early days, the three Orr zones and later Southsun, Dry Top, The Silverwastes, all four HoT zones and even Bloodstone Fen had no hearts, because hearts weren't supposed to exist in the game in the first place.
---
But a percentage of the playerbase asked for them. They wanted that solo content they could do. They even asked for repeatable hearts. So Anet added those into the game.
---
If you're doing a single world complete or zone complete on a character, it probably doesn't matter that much, but after 15 world completes, I can tell you I'm over hearts. lol
---
You'll catch up, because the game doesn't keep moving the bar further and further like most games. We've had two expansions that neither raised the level cap nor introduced a new tier of gear. And unlike a lot of games, we don't really have runaway inflation. You'l be fine.  There aren't many games that are as catchupable as this one.
---
Are you sure?
