Have to buy another bank tab? WAI.

---
---
I’ll be hopping on Phantasy Star On-Line 2 as soon as it drops. Hoping we get a native port for Switch as well (Japan only got a streaming version).
---
Standard models bruh. It’s better for your gameplay anyway
---
Coming soon: Rainbow Caterpillar infusion.
---
&gt; there are entire specs not being used  
---

---
there is not a single spec not used in pve.
---
Path of Exile is really good if you can tolerate getting into an aRPG.  It definitely helps to use build-guides until you've got your feet firmly planted on the ground, but I don't think it takes much away from the game because the builds in the game are so diverse.  Your skill system works sort of like materia in Final Fantasy VII; you equip it via sockets, and then link it to support gems.  Support gems add an extra layer of really deep, thoughtful and inventive play to the game.  I'd suggest just searching, "3.7 League Starters," on YouTube and taking a look at some of the builds you can put together.
---
Not an mmo but check out Monster Hunter: World.
---
FFXIV still works this way.
---
Heh I have one but never bother using it. I just open it on a medium armor character to maybe skew things slightly.
---
Having one is even less important now that mithril and elder wood prices have increased.
---
I unlocked the exotic WvW armor as the pre-req to buy the asc armor from the WvW vendor via grand master marks. It’s not the fastest way but it works. 
---
Or, buy/farm pearls to make minstrel insignias and stat swap ascended armor you already own.
---
&gt;The reason we're not hearing anything anymore on Alliances is very likely because
---
...the dev team is extremely small, slow, or busy with other projects
---
I also have one but it's mainly a bank character for storing clutter at the moment.
---
I've been linked to BG two linkings ago. I don't think they are stacked at all. I play NA and they usually have just have only 1-2 queued map on weekend, and 0-1 on weekdays. Queues are fairly short too, usually single digits and never seen it go over 20, unless cookie blob is trying to get into another map. 
---
They also don't have a lot big guilds. Most BG guilds just rallies 10-15 players. The rest are roamers and pugs. Here is where the difference lies. BG is run mostly by roamers and pugs, and these people plays like how Anet intended wvw to be. Actively trying to take stuff from other servers, and defending when it needs to be. Red BL is just the same 5-10 people PPT-ing like hell during NA. In other servers, more often than not, things just don't progress without a commander.
---
I'd definitely not complain if I could toggle unicorn vomit effects off.
---
The last time I heard about BDO is when people ridiculed cash system that was filled with ultra expensive cosmetics and "convenience" items that you must purchase if you plan to play the game and not feel depressed.
---
Maybe you should have stayed a bit longer since you are able to use the trading post all though it is limited to basic crafting materials and crafted items. It is a limitation for sure but saying you can not use it at all is incorrect.
---
How many of them are really playing the game and not being afk or afk play the game?
---
You're not wrong but its still a very popular game.
---
There are still quite a few people playing the game mode, albeit many of them are newbies instead of the vets who quit. The BG issue is due to too many people bandwagoning and good off-hours coverage.
---
Class design leads to lower population and less enjoyable fights, but it is less relevant to the BG situation as we're talking about peak T1 populations here.
---
In that case, your argument is invalid if that is all you can come up with.
---
Salvage-o-matic is a convenience item, and not a feature. It has alternatives since level 2: salvage kits.
---
Expansion features are just that...expansion features (like gliding and mounts). You buy an expansion and thus you get what comes with it, even if a feature is retroactive. Pretty simple concept really.
---
A critical feature would be something like wardrobe. Did you have to pay extra to get that? No!
---
...but do humour me and try prove me wrong. ANet has been extremely good about avoiding critical features through the gemstore, and alike.
---
Are you getting that number from Steam? Most people use the native client.
---
Even boon specs dont use defensive setups though, they're focused on heal/concentration builds. There are a few of them, even though the meta ones tend to blow the rest out of the water. It's just about diversity of play. If there's a whole set of gear and weapons and specs based around being a pile of health and armor, the should be a use for them as well. Otherwise, just remove them so that I can stop crying whenever I hover over the defense tree on my warrior.
---
But the question is where Tybalt ended up. 
---
If he ended up in the "Raid Realm", which is unlikely, because there were only humans, he was directly within Dhuums reach and probably got eaten. 
---
If he ended up in the same realm Snaff and Eir came (most likely the domain of the lost), he probably went to the same realm in the mists as them too, after he left the underworld. 
---
&gt; i guess it safe to say that Dhuum also got control over all of them and river of souls included every soul in it
---
I don't agree. I mean Mad King Thorns realm is also in the Underword and yet it's safe from Dhuum. Also we met souls and judge in the domain of the losts. We know that Eir and even Snaff went to another realm of the mists, so why should it be different for Tybalt (who died between Snaff and Eir, chronologically).
---
I guess is skimmed through that :P
---
Except about half the people refuse to set foot in there cause the Desert Map Meme.
---
Cookie needed more mass to make more people dc when he joins the map.
---
Are you sure? Because that's what our community commanders say -&gt; if you don't have the mastery, just spam AOEs. And most of the time people say it worked. 
---
I never looked at their classes, but I don't think they all were necros.
---
&gt; They also don't have a lot big guilds. Most BG guilds just rallies 10-15 players. The rest are roamers and pugs. Here is where the difference lies. BG is run mostly by roamers and pugs, 
---
Truth, linked to BG for the past few weeks now. I'm trying to get into wvw zerg play but there's little to no pug squads (except for the two comms running with &lt;10 people and don't use voice comm). 
---
I had a bunch of day offs last week and was on in different hours of the day trying to catch a proper organised squad, no luck. In the end I just switch to my roamer, do my dailies and leave. It's disheartening.
---
His point is you justify some unrealistic things but not others.
---
They should've removed all the timegates entirely, not just reduced them.
---
What do you even need 70 characters for?
---
I played LWS1 and I can't stand the way Kasmeer and the gang replace the Pact (and the Orders). The transition makes no sense, even for people who played it.
---
In GW2 Tyria begins as a place broken by the dragons - no single race was able to beat them and most races had lost great ground in combating them. Even the singular styles and strategies of the Orders were inadequate. Through the personal story we explore the strengths of the individual races, we explore the Orders and we build up the conclusion that one race can't defeat the dragons, nor can one style of fighting them - it takes the Pact.
---
Immediately after that we pretend the AMAZING accomplishment of the Pact (the death of the very first Elder Dragon in known history, something believed impossible) never happened and not only do we not recognize the vital role the Pact played (and all our own involvement with it) but we actively disregard it by working with four randos with no accomplishments to indicate why we chose them over the bloody Pact we helped found.
---
The insistence the story has on pretending the Pact doesn't exist and that Dragon's Watch is the vehicle for defeating dragons is killing the Elder Dragon story and the wider story of GW2 because it ignores continuity. I lost it when someone says after defeating Kralkatorik that all of Tyria were like members of Dragon's Watch - THAT'S THE BLOODY PACT!!! 
---
Dragon's Watch was a redundant excuse the writers came up with to justify the constant inclusion of Taimi and the others as experts on any conflict when the first chapter of the story distinctly sets up the rest of Tyria as capable. The uneasy excuse used during Season 1 was Scarlet wasn't (known to be) a minion of an Elder Dragon and even though she was causing more damage than the dragons (including destroying Lion's Arch) the Pact "only deals with dragon threats". This excuse was blown out of the water in Season 2 when Mordremoth is revealed (off screen, and it was explained the Pact were the ones who told us of it) yet somehow we don't work with the Pact at all.
---
The writers lost control of their story and continuity when they abandoned the Pact as the vehicle for the narrative and invested everything into Dragon's Watch, who require constant maintenance to justify why they featured so prominently in the story.
---
Because it's an mmo. Stats matter. If I wanted to do power dps but didn't have any precision or ferocity, no amount of "skill" is going to make my damage any higher.
---
As for the being carried, I dont. The whole post was supposed to be about how we could work a defensive setup into PvE without breaking the game. It's just to add some variety to a game currently drowning in it's own dps classes.
---
And this part is just my own preference, but I dont care at all about WvW/PvP. PvE only for me.
---
Fair enough
---
https://snowcrows.com/ optimized raidbuilds  
---
https://discretize.eu/ same just for fractals  
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki all kinds of builds you also have to take with a grain of salt.  
---
...in terms of xpacs: you miss out on the story, elite specs which are mostly a direct upgrade of the class you play and give the game a bit more diversity, gliding and other stuff like end to end portals, mounts which make the game better overall, achievements and the living story which you can't play if you do not own a certain xpac (season 2 is playable just with the base game, 3 with HoT and 4 with PoF)...each season is like a storyline of a xpac in a few episodes (likea tv show) and each of them also has their own map with shitton of stuff.  
---
also if you are interested in that stuff: raids.
---
You haven't lived until you've done WvW and solo a gate with melee attacks. Not sure what's worse: Actually doing it, or that no one from the enemy side came to stop me...
---
Why grab names and just leave them to rot? Bit of a dick move.
---
I really wish that the brandstone meteors appeared in every map of S4. Same with the volatile crystals that you can run over on beetle for some VM. They both feel like things that should have become a constant addition, and instead were - like many things introduced in one episode of a LW Season - ignored and never seen again.
---
&gt;start pinging your multitool special action after 15 minutes since last meteor landing
---
Since you're already at the astralarium, just listen for the NPC to shout a new brandstone meteor is falling. THEN ping.
---
Just jump back in at the speed you were playing before.  If you get to the point where you need a new adventure, get Heart of Thorns.  Done with that?  Path of Fire.  Most of the story stuff you missed is kinda picked behind being able to access some of those maps anyway...  But at least they're on the gem store if you really want to play them.
---
Welcome back, and good luck!
---
If you want discussion, maybe remove the assumptions.  I seriously doubt gems have an effect on their decisions for wvw, transfers probably isn't much ( this is also an assumption !!)
---
That said, I have nothing to contribute much except wvw usually is a coverage issue and not raw population. BG have a lot of people that just play too much. :P
---
Also BG is tier 2 in the past without a link. Don't know why devs thought a link is needed.
---
okay, lets break it down, you can avoid damage in this game with active denfenses pretty easy.  
---
point is: you want a) being able to tank damage through defensive stats and b) do enough damage do kill something in a reasonable time.  
---
how is that not being carried by stats if you do not have to dodge anymore.  
---
there is a reason why contagion scourge with trailblazer gear is looked upon and no one ever takes something done with this really serious since it is brainded easy.  
---
but there you go, play contagion scourge in trailblazer gear. you wont ever die.
---
Never intended to do that, really. Just all my focus was on my main account. But I've actually been going back and reviving this alt, so I'm remedying the neglect.
---
I liked him too. I was pretty sad by the end of HOT :(  
---
However I felt a bit compensated when they added the Caladbog collection. I loved repairing it, it was heart warming for me, because of him. Especially considering his final words in the instance there.   
---
In my eyes he  never stole the spotlight, he emphasized everywhere it was a team effort and NPCs also praised everyone contributing, not just him or us (I'm one of those players who listens to every idle chat, and talks to every NPC).   
---
I also think numerous players seem to have a failed interpretation of what a war general or an important faction leader does. Most of the time it's desk job. And these leaders are very rarely at the front lines, because they are the most valuable and many times irreplaceable. (I also don't like being the main potato in every game I step foot into)
---
People stealing my fish in Thunderhead... Annoys me waaaay more than it probably should
---
And when you're all stealthed up in Sandwept with a clear shot on some prairie dogs and BOOM someone with a raptor appears out the damn sky :@
---
40-50 each run for say 5 toons and boom. 250ish berries. Enough to snag a trinket.
---
Sometimes I think I get Blindness from the encounter, but it turns out that a medium-sized Sun just joined the battle.
---
That is crazy cool!
---
Still needs tuning. Nothing about it loving to cling to walls at every little opportunity it gets is fun.
---
If should have a separate hotkey for it, or a toggle function, where you can choose if you want to beounting to walls at that very moment or not.
---
As much as I rag on *certain* parts of Warframe, it is overall a really fun game. The mobility system is absolutely fantastic and redeems the game from a plethora of bugs and balance issues.
---
It's what I hop between as well in terms of longterm play, but I usually dive in deep on single player character action games now and again. It's been a really good couple of years for that genre and I'm loving it.
---
Requiring 250 of each map currency was a low blow. Thats like on the level of getting one of the gifts for the legendary trinket. I got 2500 branded masses in TH for the weapon set earlier, and having to go back and farm more just feels really depressing.
---
But it's no different from any event. Skritt burglar, if someone opens the chest before people are there, people will miss it. Bounties if someone starts them before people get there, people can miss it.
---
It's not a big huge deal, it's just common courtesy like holding the door for someone.   I don't slam the door in people's faces if I'm going through first, even though the design of the door is to close.
---
If people are coming and you're the first guy there, give them a chance to get there.
---
Sometimes in WVW I'm capping a ruin for the daily and I see someone coming. I know if I stay in the circle, they'll miss out. So I get out of the circle and wait for them. It's not a badly designed circle.
---
I know you've mentioned ESO already, but as someone who has just started playing it on the side, I find it engaging enough (and I'm a 5+ year GW2 player who needs a break from the game lol).
---
The Housing thing seems like scam, but it is optional, and I doubt it's something you *really* need in the game, especially as a new player.
---
I'll admit I'm a bit overwhelmed by the vast skill options and no limit on weapons/armors, but the combat is pretty decent (and as similar as it can get to GW2 imo).
---
My only real gripe is the material storage issue that others have mentioned (that being material storage is only available via a subscription fee thing), but I've learned to throw things away...
---
What's that matter in a free trial?
---
Tera combat feels really janky
---
Saw that Pooh guy in SW this weekend. Always brightens my day!
---
https://www.youtube.com/user/ksfrecords as well as https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGvgxDMpKyliTpy83S-VTLw are a couple channels you should check out for up to date surfing world records :) I've got more hours surfing in CS than I do in GW1+2
---
You know what, I'm mad at you because that actually sounds pretty awesome and I'm going to look in to it when I get on next. Thanks.
---
Also, I dont want an easy button. It's just a fun playstyle to laugh off all but the biggest attacks while hitting bosses with their own CC bar. Being that guy that will sprint into a boss AoE to pick up his downed buddy. Theres no need for it to take God blows or sit in death puddles. It adds an extra flavor to the game and I wanted to discuss how it could fit into the current system.
---
I think where I may have opened up a bad lane is by focusing on damage in my original post. As if it does good damage without having to obey any of the mechanics, then what's the point of playing a squishy. That was never my intention.
---
Happened to me too when I was baiting the fish in Thunderhead Peaks... was quite amusing running around with one arm stuck straight up in the air no matter what I was doing.
---
Idk.. just by looking at the item one could idk.. assume one was interested in it. Otherwise, why look at it?
---
Definitely. The other options are agonizingly slow but this one is okay.
---
Your statement can be true and they're still stacked compared to others in terms of total hours
---
Not to mention all the strange talking statues of some gnarly looking dude who seems to be full of himself and fumbling with the recording device.
---
Do you have the masteries trained yet. It improves 100% when you get the masteries trained and learn how to fly it. It's a skill based mount. Very satisfying.
---
Ok, well for comparison, I’m on SoS...  We’re in the same tier as BG every other week and the only time there is *EVER* a queue is on Friday Night Reset...  And after that calms down, we get outnumbered pip bonuses on 2/3 of the BL maps for basically the rest of the weekend.
---
&gt;Has anybody been suspended with no reason or time limit?
---
Yes, this happened to people for different reasons. That's why they tell you to contact support.
---
This could simply be a security measure as they might've thought your account got hacked.
---
Or you got banned for something
---
Or they made a mistake
---
I still love that hero point challenge in Vabbi:  "Hey can you ~~help us train~~ beat the hell out of our awakened family members?"
---
Mrs. Fantastic's husband obviously.
---
Congrats!! Spend some time maxing the masteries, and try out the griffon adventures!! It is tremendously satisfying to master them all!! and then discover how much better at flying you are than when you started!!
---
Not yet but I’ll start on them.
---
The amount of extra gold from doing this to open Champion boxes or bags is very small. I would rather trade the gems required for a character slot for raw gold and mak emore profit than I would from (sarcastic amount) 5000 boxes.
---
*Cute weird Norn Puppy Eyes*
---
You sure? 
---
*Sad face* :(
---
You look at the shop, see the item, but don't really have a use for it right now so you pass. If you knew it was a weekly limit you'd buy it expecting you'll need it in bulk for something in the future. But you're not going to attempt to buy something you're not immediately interested in, however if it were a weekly limit item you'd immediately be interested in it. The game leaves out critical information out that would help you make a decision on buying the item.
---
&gt; tangled depths is my favorite map in the entire game
---
I don't know if I'll take seriously the opinion of an insane person.
---
It's still my favorite mount even after skyscale, but skyscale is more useful so my pretty griffen is stuck in its coup 
---
Griffen feels more fluid/flowing and once you get the mastery imo it's the fastest mount (argument can be made for beetle but its marginal)
---
Not sure if this is a good idea or not. If they do make it to where you can buy keys they should limit it to a few per day. Only reason I say this is, sometimes you may not tag enough events to get enough keys to open all chests though the Champ train at the end. Or, a different idea, they could bump the rewarded keys by 1 which would be much better than selling them IMO.
---
It's not very optimized, and theres a game breaking bug where your character just resets back to tutorial. Happened to one of my friends while we were playing, and we never played it again.
---
Others have mentioned the trick to getting the water to hit them and the option of gathering boxes underwater. There’s also the bar where you can drink several beverages that grant heart progress.
---
I hate that map so much. Easier with flying mounts, yes, but I still hate it.
---
Fine those 50 players can play on their own without a link
---
I was 1 of the 3 assistant editors for AK Season 3. My buddy cut this episode and I worked on ep 2, 5, 8, and 13. I spotted that poster pretty early on and noticed it’s consistent throughout all episodes in Craig’s room. It was a fun show to work on and so glad GW2 got some subtle advertising!! Season 4 just premiered recently. 😆
---
I'm surprised nobody has mentioned the resurgence of City of Heroes.  Fans have put up a few "rogue" servers to play the game again.  It's a great nostalgia trip and pretty solid gameplay for a game (slightly) predating WoW.  Just, deal with the 2k4 graphics and it's both deep and challenging.
---
Maybe WoW for strictly another mmo* 
---
Most other mmos are dead or dying, if you end up liking WoW, Star Wars The Old Republic is very much a star wars skinned WoW clone, if you also like star wars (but that is a dead game) still a very fun solo player story game in an mmo though
---
Feels clunky
---
Boons may give participation, but you still have to deal damage, to make it count. Sharing boons alone doesn't give participation, to prevent afk farming etc. 
---
However, Kalla Skill 7 should be a good addition, since the bleeding count as your condition.
---
For stuff like zone complete and getting around HoT maps or really any of the multilevel maps, it's a godsend.  Griffon is much faster to cross a zone but not much  use when you're on the lowest level on TD.  Like every mount in the game, this one has its niche. Considering the map design of some maps, it's a pretty big niche.
---
I'm in FA and we haven't had a queue in I don't know how long and also outnumbered on most maps all through out the day and night. Outnumbered pips are nice though.
---
I don't understand the wow comment. I thought I would hate it and never gave it a chance. GW2 was my first mmo and I was anti-wow. I got so bored with GW2 that I tried it and I love it. There are mods you can add from Twitch to change the UI. Mine is pretty much set up like GW2. There's so much to do there too and when you turn on war mode even more fun. How long did you try playing it? Also, don't care on either if the gameplay is different or not because both are mmos. I went back and bought GW1 (yes people still play it) after I played GW2 for like 2 years and that game is absolutely amazing. Hated it at first thought because of the gameplay and no jumping but once I got used to it I didn't play GW2 for a really long time. I tried a few others but those are the 3 I will always play. I tried Tera, Warframe, Aion and a few other but didn't like them. I hear BDO is good and making a comeback but I haven't tried it yet.
---
Congratulations!! I know you will have fun with it! Max out your masteries for the maximum effort!  A lot of people are working on their skyscales atm, if you do decide to go that route later, I would highly suggest stocking up on charged quartz. If you don't decide to get it, you can always use the charged quartz for other goodies.
---
so what purpose will it serve in open world? do people that don't have an ascended just get lock out of a certain map if they do have enough ar?
---
2017 called, it wants its mount back 😂😂
---
JK jk. Grats!
---
What would be the difference between these maps and Fractals?
---
You can see Fractals as meta events from different maps that require AR to be done in harder difficulties.
---
&gt;it would be nice so people have something to work for and look forward to
---
What about Raids? CM Fractals? Tier 4 Fractals? Legendary Gear? Achievements? Making money? Creating other professions?
---
Binding the mount action keys gives the dash and descending without popping you off mount, I have decend to my 3 key and it works perfectly
---
tbh I would like to see fractals not require agony resistance
---
Same purpose as it does in fractals. And you wouldn't be locked out, but you would want to have AR. Just like if you're I'm a high level area you want better armor
---
With the amount of time I spend crashing the beetle, I’m much faster on the griffin. I agree that it feels more fluid than the skyscale too, though I adore my skyscale.
---
Economy is currently fucked a bit so the effect isn't that massive vs the effort. It even changed from lvl 49 opener to something like 20 for while.
---
API seems broken too, but the tool to see level, when api works again, is https://silverwastes.loltools.net/ (it's been lvl 49 for years). 
---
Basically you open champion bags with it. Those bandit coin bags, gilded coffers, adventurers bags. You get more platinum, rugged leather, linen and so on. Those sell for more than 40-50 copper mithril or 30 copper silk.
---
 What doesn't matter is HoT stuff with "magic find effects this" text, Unidentified gear, bags that only give materials like https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bag_of_Stolen_Goods (they usually have same-ish icon). *Those* give lvl 80 gear and materials are based on bag not level.
---
But as others said, unless you run SW, you probably do meta rush or dragonfall. You don't have to hassle with openers there.
---
Nope wouldn't like to see it. Fractals were added for people who liked to grind gear. Many players in this game don't. Gating open world maps would enrage people. Why make ascended gear a hard requirement for the open world, other than to just piss people off? What would it add to the game?
---
I usually put on a video and sells things till I get the msg, hop on reddit, scroll, check if video is interesting, brush my teeth, run some errands, then come back to sell 1 more stack and repeat the process 
---
Super annoying but I'll actually divert my attention from gw2 and then come back after 30 seconds to continue selling (I dont think anet has a fix for this though)
---
I get that. But in a way that's just like how you can't use your other characters (under 80) on all maps. I don't think it would lock out newer players, basic AR is fairly cheap and easy to obtain.
---
Well the whole game is kinda grindy, that's just how RPGs are. I honestly thought people would like the idea.
---
Maybe if the amount of damage agony did in the open world was capped at, say, 15% hp/tick, which would take about 60-75% of your health when being hit by an agony inflicting attack.
---
It'd make it pretty punishing to not have proper AR for the area you're in, but not outright fatal. (Though I could definitely see there being a limit to that kind of mercy. It'd be a little ridiculous if a bunch of 0 AR characters were in a 150 AR required zone. Maybe if the character's AR is more than 50 below the required AR, they get the full effects of agony?)
---
Different kinds of players want different kinds of things. This game was sold originally in the idea of no gear grind, or no required gear grind. When ascended gear first came out, a few months after launch, a whole lot of people left the game because of it. They don't want gear grind and neither do I. Many of us came here to get away from gear grind. 
---
I don't want to play a game where I need better gear to do something. If I wanted to do that, I'd be back playing WoW, or some other game. I want a game where I'm not a coatrack for greatness. Where my skill matters more than my gear.
---
This completely artificial gear check is one of the things that drive people away from MMOs. Skins are fine to grind for, because they don't lock me out of content. That's how many of us want it.
---
Don't Google about it. We have seen so many people who post here claiming wrongfully banned, end up getting their assets owned by Anet with definite proof. At the same time, there have been miscommunication between both parties and all have been sorted off as well.
---
As a third party, I won't know if you are trying to hack into another account and claiming reddit sympathy. So trust in Anet in this to sort out. If the support revert with statements like "no we will not review your case", you reply to the effect of "thank you for your efforts in looking at this. But I firmly believe this is an incorrect resolution. Would you kindly escalate this matter to a SENIOR GM, please"
---
The game has voluntary grind for the most part. To do most content, I can just get exotics and not even bother with ascended. In fact I'm an altoholic with over 40 characters and most of them don't have ascended armor or even weapons. And I don't need it to play. What do you think having an ascended requirement would do to my enjoyment of the game. I'll give you a hint. After spending that amount of money on character slots, I'd be furious to have to gear up that many characters. And no, I hate moving gear around, it's not an option for me.
---
Yeah beetle is almost too fast, or just needs better handling 
---
Just waiting for those skyscale skins now so that Skylar can compete with Sparky the griffen
---
Oof, that's bad.
---
100 healing total, over 5 seconds
---
This is such a 1% problem.
---
Every server says that about every other server.
---
Devs made at least one of Invisimans to cast laser walls in Frizz lab (fractal). Not sure why one of them "decide" to be.. less invisi than his name suggest.
---
As of recently, most stat selectable gear lets you pick any stat combo.

Bladed gear from verdant brink night time might be the cheapest way to get the armor, and any living story trinkets can have harrier stats now, so whichever currency you have/can farm.
---
The weapon is the toughest part, you might end up having to craft or buy that one. Plated staff from dragon's stand is the easiest one to farm.
---
2 precursors for shortbow (Lover). In same day. From same dungeon. Around same waypoint. WP called "Lovers"
---
Beat it.
---
Agreed. T4 already has some questionable people, especially during the weekends (hello Staff power Scourge from yesterday).
---
This would make T4 unbearable and LFG would be one toxic wasteland trying to find experienced people. You would get the same situation as with Raids, but worse, since there isnt really any KP apart from 99 or 100 CM titles/drops.
---
Is pso2 still alive? I remember playing on Japanese version and my translation patch didn't work well.
---
The beetle races are a great way to practice with it.
---
They're by far my favorite adventures too, but my system can't handle some of them. When you're diving down and flap, you start going so fast that the graphics haven't caught up. A couple courses make you take super tight maneuvers and the lag just makes it impossible :/
---
Yeah and Griffon Adventures help immensely in maneuvering training within tight spaces, thus making maintaining height feels like second nature. 
---
Pre nerf griffon was so fun. Never forget.
---
I run a lot of the multi map meteor farms and from my experience you get more loot when it fails. I know it sounds backwards. I have never seen the timer reset though. I have also never gotten any loot until the event has ended. Hit 5 to mark it and spam 3 until it fails.
---
I can give a couple opinions since I've been looking for other MMOs since exhausting Gw2's pvp and WvW. 
---
Maplestory 2 is alright. You can't really take this game too seriously and it's more a social platform than a game. The vertical progression model makes the game pretty hard to progress at endgame. They just had an expansion release so if you want to try it out, there are many events that accelerate progress right now but the population has dwindled down to a fraction of what it previously was. PvP is no fun. 
---
Tree of Savior is ... avoid it. The game itself is really good but there isn't enough population to sustain any of the end-game content like party quests, dungeons, guild wars, etc. Not that there aren't people playing because the people that play this game are really dedicated to it but it's rather empty. The grind can get pretty heavy later in the game and without party quests, you'll find things even more difficult. PvP has a small dedicated playerbase but the game doesn't incentivize pvp so its more of a side-game than anything. You can't competitively pvp on a character that is pve focused and with the grind in the game, it doesn't really make a lot of sense to partake in both PvP and PvE. 
---
Black Desert Online is the one I've been playing a lot of recently. The combat mechanics in BDO are far better than Gw2's but that's mostly because it doesn't suffer the problems of fast-paced tab targeting system. To participate in general PvP with a large amount of the other playerbase necessitates a lot of gear and, hence, a lot of grinding to get that gear. Honestly, it's daunting despite the game making it easier to reach that base level (called soft-cap) and it honestly seems insurmountable in the beginning because the vertical progression is ridiculously un-intituive and borderline unfair. But like I said, the combat is incredibly fun and just fighting in the open world against other people of similar gear levels is addicting. The community is a little toxic but its mostly because its a more difficult game so the nerd levels are high and people get more butthurt easily. In this, the community is also really tight-nit and the people that play this game are really hardcore into this game. Unlike popular belief, BDO is really populated, to the point that a lot of the areas are over-saturated. 
---
Because the game is much more mechanically intensive and each class exists almost in a vacuum of others (as in they don't have designated support or trinity-esque dynamics like Firebrand), it doesn't suffer the same overbearing issues of balance that GW2 suffers from. Ofcourse, some of the classes are obviously better than others in some areas of the game but its not as unmitigated as gw2s. 
---
 
---
The game itself functions on an open-world combat system so that can be really frustrating for new players since stronger players can come kill you and take your pve spot. Other than that, it has "Node wars" which is a similar style of gameplay to WvW where guilds can fight over areas in the world. Unlike WvW that is split into a separate instance, you actually get advantages and money (from tax mechanics from the economy of the world) if you win over an area so some areas are more popular than others. The highest level and largest guilds can participate in "Seige War" where they fight to take over a castle/major city (which obviously have more monetary and pve incentives). In order to facilitate this, the guild system in BDO is very robust where you can alliance with other guilds to attack a single stronger guild among other features (such as a salary or sea-monster hunting).
---
I turn my graphics way down for adventures. Only then was I able to get the Barnstormer title from Labyrinthine Cliffs.
---
My biggest gripe with skyscale is the maximum height mechanic (red bar) will force you to auto descend. I would prefer if it just acts as a maximum bar until you land or lose altitude.
---
Exactly my feelings, specially the constant "getting stuck" in the walls feeling all the time. Griffon is by FAR still my favorite mount though, because it is an all terrain, the perfect mix between versatility and speed.
---
Well maybe that's the real problem with BG. It is just boring for guilds to be chasing around a bunch of roamers doing PPT and where the only big fights is from a map queue that wont fight unless they outnumber you. We can see it in the activity numbers time and time again. I used to have an account on BG and I'd get bored too watching the 20 roamars afk in EBG keep waiting for a tag to show.
---
why should it stop bots from selling?
---
its mostly there as an band aid fix to make the tp more usable because their code/servers suck
---
I went to tangle depths today for the lolz. Found a random shaft upwards. Hopped on my Skyscale and flew up. Long story short I ended up accidentally breaking out of the map and got to explore the outside of tangled depths. So although I don’t think they were made to complement each other necessarily... it still was pretty cool to explore the outside of the map, a surprising lack of invisible walls and it’s a very large area
---
Red side of Eb is awful too. They used to have ogres and veloka as easily defendable towers, but ogres had to be moved because of gliding. Anz is easily a free tower daily and mendons doesnt get support from keep siege unlike the other side inner towers. 
---
Well to top it off, red keep can be easily trebbed from smc or cata by the hills near it, which makes outer easily down for the side with the least presence. Sure, they can treb smc too, but its overall a bad tradeoff for getting your keep papered easily during off hours.
---
What's the word on future legendaries? I vaguely recall hearing no more would be released but that was before my last hiatus from the game and also my memory is bad. I hope there'll be more, or at least more weapons with effects/animations.
---
After you get the masteries, check out [the wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Griffon_\(mount\)#Movement.2FControls) for control rebinds/tips and tricks. By default the "pull-up" key is bound to S, which is silly since that also makes you slow down. Rebind it and you're *soaring*.
---
It’s crazy how easy it becomes to break out of TD with mounts like springer and Skyscale. You just jump through one little hole no one thought to put an invisible wall on and BAM you’re out
---
multiple characters + the wood respawns multiple times in a day.
---
Do you plan on roaming or going with a group?
---
Population is calculated by unique logins in WvW that have played for a certain amount. I believe it might be linked to pips by now, but I do know that their population counting is supposed to actually be pretty sound.
---
Oops, my bad. I'll see myself out.
---
Talk about timegates
---
Banners is "the best'?
---
It is allowed as long as it is not a bot, so the gms do whisper checks.
---
&gt; maintain your height ~~infinitely~~
---
Until first obstacle
---
FTFY :D
---
I mean an armor set.
---
Maybe some new ascended weapons that take allot of different stuff from different fractals.
---
I was able to do many of those on gold after I upgraded my computer. Real difference! Worth it :)
---
where to get infusions? been playing for some years now and have no clue :3
---
Go for the griffon, it will vastly help anywhere in gw2. The skyscale is nearly endgame (all of living world season four).
---
Don't bother, OP just wants to brag about "not being punished". It's not the first post, but it's always the same: "This guy is doing afk farm and casts every skill on CD, how can I do this?"
---
And the answer is always: It's not possible without a bot - which is punishable... and then "it's not punishable, he's doing this afk for month. Money printer bla bla bla".
---
OP needs attention. And in a few days, there will be the same topic with a different username.
---
It's getting an English release spring 2020 unless they delay it.
---
I came back not long ago and I still see she didnt post anything for a month.. i really wonder what happened?
---
Final Fantasy 14
---
Could you elaborate on this? I just got the skyscale, but don't have the griffon yet as I haven't finished PoF. Is it still worth getting?
---
If you're going to pay cash for living world epsiodes anyway, my money is on the skyscale. The griffon goes faster, but I just find the skyscale more useful in difficult to get places. So if you're looking for fast travel across zones griffon is much better, but I find myself spending more time exploring on my skyscale...even when I'm just map completing core Tyrian zones.
---
If you weren't going to buy the living world seasons or you weren't going to pay cash for them, get the griffon first. 
---
But it really is a matter of preference as well.
---
So yeah, as others have already said, unidentified gear will always give level ~76-80 gear. Pretty much all other bags scale to the character level though. Bags like "Bag of Gear", "Noxious Seed Pod", "Deluxe Gear Box" and so on will be scaled to character level.
---
So how do you know which baga to open on a low level char? Well, either try it yourself or check the wiki. Most bags scale to level though. The only bags you should open on a high level char are "Bags of Rare Gear" as they can give you high level rares which you can salvage into ectos.
---
No seriously Anet, pls fix tp. Yesterday I was getting error 404 just by entering Tp. How is that even possible lol
---
I see that's good info thanks. I did want to do the story. I just finished HoT and was thinking of doing the previous seasons before completing PoF for more context of the lore etc.
---
Hmm I was under the impression that logging on during the current season meant having all of it unlocked. What you're saying is only the current seasons current episode will be then bummer
---
Griffon ofc.
---
Skyscale hands down.   
---
More versatile and fun imo. You'll even get more speed out of him than griff unless your riding your griff to a high standard, which most don't bother while getting from point A to B and it's main niche, extreme speeds to cover vast distances I don't personally find useful because I'm very rarely in a place where I'm high enough and the place I'm going to is far enough. He can go across a whole map in 30s flat if you have enough airspace, but in reality your just gonna use the closest WP to your destination and go across varying terrain.   
---
And there's bonuses like not needing to swap to rabbit basically ever again, clinging on to walls, hoovering and avoiding enemies. If you fuck up somewhere you can comfortably mount skyscale and just stay in palce until you figure out where you'll go next and get your bearings. (for example I don't know VB that well so I ended up flying way lower with griffon and had to regain verticality often).   
---
tl;dr If you want utility/versatility over speed then skyscale is your boi, if you want to be the king of mounted travel and get all those juicy gold races, then griffon.   
---
You will want both eventually, but for which one first my vote def goes to Skyscale.
---
Thanks for in depth reply. I will stick to this advices:D
---
I really hope they do. Templates is the only addon I use, simply for not making my party wait for me to adjust to a different build when we fail some higher tier fractal.
---
thank you
---
Not MMORPG but I combine GW2 with playing Factorio on public servers. Totally different fun, pretty good game in general (top 2 of all times on Steam). Definitely totally different to mix stuff if you feel bored at the minute in GW2. Probably too radical change though :D
---
Well generaly it means an error has occured that anet didnt expect or didnt know can happen (there are expected errors and unexpexted), so when this error is occuring anet also doesnt know whats wrong and what could pottentialy be displayed to the user, so easiest way is to hide the error and throw a new error which contains a generic message.
---
It doesn't because only wvw population is showed and even if it doesn't say it's populated there's still server links that balance population to certain degree. Pve and pvp use megaservers.
---
The engage skill (and generally dismounting it) is probably the worst part of the mount. Its like, "get that mofo, ahhhhh!! ...[super slow decent]."
---
I feel like this is pretty much anet’s position on fixing any of the numerous bugs in the game at this point. Unless it affects gem sales, it’s not worth fixing.
---
Never happens in AU..  Takes too long to respond for anything on the TP, it's not even possible to list enough sell orders to get capped :)
---
If you have the gold, they dont really takes long to craft as in waiting for events. However, the gen2+ take thousands of mithril/wood, which translates into literal hours of crafting if you use ore/logs instead of straight buying ingots/planks. And I dont mean it takes a while, again, I mean you press "craft all" and it will take you an hour or two of your character making the materials. Compare this to gen 1, where you only need to actually craft a total of a few minutes if you have all the mats ready.
---
Side note, gen1 are actually much cheaper. If you want a lege for the sake of having one, that incinerator is going to be around 500g cheaper--in addition to being quicker to craft.
---
Not just those, anything but casual content Anet just doesnt care.
---
The Griffon for sure. For a start you already have everything you need (as opposed to additional LS episodes), then it's relatively quick to obtain (compared to skyscale), and finally it'll make the Skyscale collections *incredibly* more convenient. I can't imagine doing the Skyscale collections and all that time on the LS4 maps without a Griffon. It's not the mount I use all the time as they all have their uses, but the Griffon is insanely convenient for map traversal. Use the Springer to reach a high point, switch to Griffon and fly to wherever you need to be, skipping all the convoluted land layout. It'll get you past walls, mountains, canyons...
---
As a tip though: for the LS4 maps you already own, start collecting those map currencies (kralkatite ore, inscribed shards, branded masses, etc...) as you'll need 250 of each for the Skyscale, so everything you slowly accumulated over time will come in handy when you get there. Just do a few heart every now and then and join a meta if it happens while you're around. It'll be a while before you get to the Skyscale, but that way it'll spare you finding yourself in need of 200+ of each currency at the last minute. :)
---
Honestly thats incredible. I want to know how this happened!
---
Went with Cleric and Superior Water Sigil. I'm running around 57% boon duration I believe.
---
In this context, those bots already exist.  This doesn't do anything but cause it to be slower.
---
Skrilla on Ember Bay,ls3 map,shout different lines about shinies!
---
With a very doable 4 gatherings per day, it's just 12-13 characters counting at 40 wood/char/gather. Myself i wouldn't want to maintain item booster on all of them.
---
Yeah you get latest episode by logging as "loyalty bonus". Rest needs to be bought :(
---
If you finished HoT, S3 continues on the story.
---
 But you can see some season 3 recaps on YouTube too (I think) - so you can to straight to PoF and work on that and get mounts and all that. Since those can be huge quality of life bonuses. I also heard you can get raptor by doing first heart on first PoF map and don't need the story intro. But I don't know since mounts are account-bound.
---
If you are very short on cash or gold right now, get season 4 *imo*. But mainly because it's current and has most players in right now, everyone doing either skyscale or legendary trinket or otherwise farming the maps like usual.
---
You managed to access websites through the TP if you disconnected the TP's internet connection but kept the games inrernet connection, it shows an errormessage with (i dont remember exactly) a clickable link and you can manage to get to google from there. I was able to get on facebook ingame
---
&gt; I just thought there was supposed to be a reason and time limit on there. 
---
There is. Reason is an account issue and time limit is until you contact support.
---
Unrelated but what is the item in the 4th last Shared Inventory slot? Don't recognise the icon...
---
It would be great of the dismount attack actually caused you to swoop with a little more speed and center the fire field on your target.
---
I'd settle for the dismount attack jsut having more speed than the ordinary descend (mount skill 2) speed.
---
Better rewards, lege, mount. Hard to recall what exactly changed in 3 years but at least we don't have perma stealth cheesy thieves.
---
"Muuum Timmy isn't sharing Rytlock's soft fur!!"
---
Uh no I mean an actual reason (inappropriate conduct, botting, assholisness, etc) and actual time limit ( 1 hour, 2 hours, 300 hours).  It did not and does not say until you contact support which I did immediately. I'm not slamming them I just asked a question because I have never been in trouble with them before.
---
If that the case they should just make it the slider go to whatever the limit is and maybe show a timer for how long people have to wait before they are able to sell again.
---
Pretty sure that's not how it works - it's a webview, but it's unlikely to be using web-based networking. It'll almost certainly be using remote procedure calls to the game engine via some binding in the webview library (which I'm pretty sure is Coherent UI), and then in turn sending/receiving packets via the engine's native netcode.
---
Of course that's not to say there isn't some intentional rate limiting in place, just that it's likely being done engine-side where they have a finer degree of control. Either way, it does seem overly aggressive.
---
I'd say a thing or two, but certain elements of this subreddit have decided it's bigotry to be tired of hearing both sides of this fight invariably resorting to hate and vitriol against each other. So I'll leave it at what I've just said.
---
They have a very different feel and a lot of different use. As someone else said, the Griffon is like a fighter jet, it's good at traversing large distance very quick, or for speedy movement, but you need some space below you to gain the most of it.
---
The Skyscale is like a big hellicopter, it's pretty slow but very good at precisely going somewhere, and it can gain height.
---
Thank you and I love you &lt;3 :D
---
The fact that it's a hell maze densely populated by stuff I *really* don't want to fight right now because I'm actually trying to get somewhere and already busy fighting the map is most of what keeps me from liking TD. I really prefer AB.
---
That would kind of defeat the purpose.
---
I swear I have never got over 100 gold.
---
Just looking at your gold makes me envious.
---
Well, now that you've made this post I'm sure you know what happens next.
---
Why do i hear eurobeat?
---
&gt; You just gotta take some time off to thoroughly explore the place. 
---
How in the seven hells do you "thoroughly explore" a place that doesn't even give you enough respite to open the map?
---
The Griffon is a general-purpose mount that occupies a role other mounts do not. The Skyscale is a specialist mount that shines when you need a griffon/springer hybrid mount, such as precise flying in a smallish area, or climbing in an environment that the springer cannot access.
---
Eso is far superior than this game, It has come a long way since launch and is the top MMO right now for a reason.
---
If you only had that to say, then why bother commenting at all?
---
Queer people deserve to be treated and respected as people, that's that. It shouldn't even be a controversial thing
---
&gt;Eir
---
Wasted for grief porn and as a disposable plot device for one of the worst characters I have ever seen in video games.
---
:D
---
In my defense, I'm old.
---
so this post wasnt about you, but you had to jump in to make it about you
---
While I personally hate infusions and don't use any of em, this is still nice of you. Thanks! :)
---
Are there pages missing here? The only thing this comic has in connection with Guild Wars 2 is that there's a charr drawn in the comic.
---
And would you believe it used to be worse?
---
LMAO
---
Sorry, he didn't make one for April so this was my only opportunity to comment at all. Maybe he'll do one for April next year. Maybe he won't.
---
&gt; or farm some gold

Well that makes them all easy to obtain.

Said this, Alliances won't fix anything. It'll become another way to bandwagoning, maybe slightly less easy to fit in... but still.
---
Arenanet really needs to address seriously WvW and PvP state, and provide both a quality life that fits a competitive mode.
---
last month, and few times before that.
---
&gt;Queer people deserve to be treated and respected as people, that's that.
---
&gt; ALL people deserve to be treated and respected as people
---
In case you worded that part genuinely I'm gonna go ahead and clarify than when people say
---
&gt;X deserve to be treated with respect
---
or similar with X being a usually discriminated minority, they are not saying that "only X deverve this" but "X deserver this TOO because right now they are not getting it compared to other people outside of group X". the implicit "too" is the part can be missed when considering both statement.
---
If you want more detailed and better explained version of this I would recommend [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3du1qm/eli5_why_is_it_so_controversial_when_someone_says/ct8pei1/) on a post about Black Lives Matter vs All Lives Matter. At the very least read the tl;dr at the end.
---
All I want is the map queue system that already exists for WvW
---
They are not the same they both have uses, get them both.
---
Ehm... correction: some protested, but MANY clapped with their ears 'cos this "helped to transfer in search of good matches where fighting" (quoted from a bandwagoner, time ago... I never will forget this lame excuse), and others also clapped 'cos they could bandwagon easily.
---
Yeah, all people deserve to be treated and respected as people. But not all people are, so what's your point? It's not straight people who risk getting beat up in the streets for holding hands. Nor is it straight people who risk getting disowned by their parents for bringing an SO back home. All LGBTQ people ask is that culture changes enough that they can do the things straight people take for granted, because they already have those rights. So they have a time of year where they call out to these issues and take pride in who they are. Isn't that good for them?
---
One group asking for respect and representation doesn't diminish your rights, so what's your point? You don't feel represented? Well, maybe not, this isn't about you, it's about them.
---
I don't doubt you or people you know have some issues where you're feeling left out. I also have issues where I don't at all feel represented. But I know if I were to call attention to the issues *I'm* facing, I'd feel pretty hurt by someone else making statements like you're doing here, because it proves you have no regard for the things I experience. If I tell you I'm feeling down, I don't want to hear "we all feel down from time to time", I want you to ask me "what's wrong?" or "what can I do?" And if you're like "I'm feeling down too, but you don't see me talking about it", all you're saying is that I don't matter to you or my issues don't matter to you.
---
If you don't feel represented, it's probably because when you *do* reach out, you get similar responses to the ones you're making here.
---
Now reso it with the "pilot arms" gizmo! :)
---
The "both sides" issue here is that one side want to be able to exist and live their life normally and the other usually wants them to not exist at all. So I'm not really sure both stances are really equal on that matter. It's not a "do you you prefer tea or coffee?" kind of topic at all.
---
I'm surprised people dont use the mount ability keybinds to check.
---
Don't be afraid to use exotic gear as ranger, all you're there for is boon uptime and healing, the extra little stats that come from ascended won't matter much for pugs (as a druid, atleast. For DPS classes it can definitely make the difference between being able to carry or not)
---
I wish this would go.... THIS. IS. SPARTAAAA.
---
&gt;It's not a "do you you prefer tea or coffee?" kind of topic at all.
---
What are you even talking about? Where in my post did I insinuate any such thing?
---
Your post seem to umply that "both" sides have valid stances and points that are worth hearing. And what I am saying is that it's simply not the case. Again, one "side" just wants the same respect that every person should get and not be discriminated against. The other "side" want the 1st one to just not exist and make their life harder. Hardly see how than can qualify as a "both sides" case.
---
But...We hust had a feels week comic!
---
Kidding, you're one of those persons who makes me proud to be part of the community and make me want to come back to the sub.
---
[removed]
---
And yet you wrote it while fully knowing that going for the ALL you were actually dismissing the very core issue because???
---
Runs smoothly for me, enjoying it very much atm, worth a try :)
---
You wouldn't happen to know what info they needed?
---
&gt; But looking at other replies you seem to be mostly here to fight/for drama so I'm gonna leave it at this.
---
You're welcome to your opinion.
---
It won't really affect you in fractals, no. There might be some random mobs who target the player with the highest toughness but for the most part it's irrelevant. However, in low tier fractals you don't really need a healer as everything dies so quickly, you're better off just playing power dps classes.
---
Higher tier fractals are played with healers if you play in more casual/standard groups. Experienced groups will most likely play without them. Anyway, the downside of clerics gear is that it doesn't have boon duration and a big part of playing druid is to provide might and fury. You can still provide sufficient might without much boon duration though, especially in fractals where you have access to fractal potions which give you boon duration as well as mistlock singularities to prestack.
---
Yes, I did. You stay so centrist you managed to say "On both sides" in their own sentences *twice*.
---
You're doing exactly what I referred to in my post, scattering the spotlight from the group that's asking to be seen, then trying to make that out as "caring". You're doing the political version of "*everyone* feels down from time to time" as I wrote above.
---
I'm not sure, but iirc at one occasion support provided a list for him too choose what to restore (just don't quote me on that), ill try asking this evening, if i see him online.
---
We have clearly spent the last year (or more) seeing different tweets and different reddit posts, then.
---
Skyscale is timegate (not sure if they have change it) so you should work on it asap, been too long since i unlock griffon so i don't remember griffon have timegate or not
---
Also none of them can replace raptor for ground travel, the only one that might replace it is jackal.
---
And personally, i use skyscale alot more than griffon, and springer is pretty much useless now except for the CC.
---
And /mjoin commander please
---
You'll get the booster, yep. Just make sure you buy it from an authorised retailer: https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers
---
That's very nice of you, thanks.
---
Welcome to EU T5 where 2 German servers without links and bad coverage (even at prime time) have to fight against linked server who have 2-3 more players at any time of the day.
---
works perfectly fine say at tequatl just afk at laser and get all the rewards without even hitting teq
---
I also put in a similar ticket, and it took close to a week. Not the best response time, but I’m guessing their CS department is pretty small
---
If you are going to purchase anything please only do so from the verified shops! You can find them on the website, they often have better discounts than the official Site, and are 100% trustable. (Hence being supported by anet)
---
That’s pretty high. The maps I’m on usually only give me 30 logs per toon, tops, even with banners and the guild boost.
---
With wood, banner and guild boost actually contribute to getting hidden stash and foxfire cluster. What gives more wood are item booster and glyph of bounty / forrester
---
o yeah, that will be a welcome change, i will be able to autoclick millions upon millions buy orders and after a day list millions upon millions materials with 1 click. yes, that wil fix economy big time
---
If you scroll down you can see full material list, for each gift as well as precursor.
---
I know that. But they managed to do so with collection storage, so I don't think it's crazy to think it may be possible with tp orders.
---
That link doesn't help me , it takes me to a page that links me a local game store that doesn't stock any of the expansions at all
---
It would be even better if you won't have to join a group to use such command
---
You can easily make ~60g per day to say the least by doing dailies and farming metas
---
Thank you for this Monstrum, I love you buddy \o/
---
Your girl sends you DMs?  You two aren't playing in the same room or on Discord?  If I were her I'd leave you and never look back.
---
found this a little later than most but thanks for sharing!
---
once again "deactivate conditional mount movement" not being activated by default is causing a good amount of confusion. you are talking about the engage skill, which for both skyscale and griffon work as an imprecise hackjob of way to descend. if you want accurate and dedicated keybinds, you'd want to look into the functions actually labelled as "mount ability 1/2".
---
The Collection Storage was likely written with the expectation that it would be increased beyond 250. It was a serious caveat in Guild Wars 1 when they introduced the Collection Storage that had the same exact limitation.
---
I can't remember if GW2 release had the ability to increase the Collection Storage cap, but if it didn't it wasn't long before they added it in.
---
Plus the Collection Storage is a little easier to handle, because each slot has a specific item assigned to it while in the regular inventory each slot can be anything. It changes up the storage dynamic a little bit, as you're no longer storing both what the item is and how many there is, just how many there is of a set in stone item.
---
Wait that works? TIL. I usually use S to pull up
---
right after we get "/rc" for ready check without having to click on the squad UI and risk misclicking on leave squad
---
by stopping the process right before the inventory fills up
---
Well, thank you sir!
---
I believe you need all of the episodes for S4 to unlock the skyscale.
---
If it makes you feel any better I found out S pulls up after the Skyscale released.
---
Silverwates for a day, watch your gold go up. Ill never have over 500g, but thats because i spend it. Leggies cost a lot :(
---
sounds like an issue easily solvable by a little bit of inventory rearrangement
---
I got myself Wisp for that reason.
---
And some others. ^^
---
I recently came back, and realized that Bags of gear (and really a lot of bags now) are giving unidentified gear. Am i better off opening those bags on a lower level toon still, or is it similar enough to opening on my 80?
---
I'll give it a shot.
---
Well, vabbi meta builds still has cele scourge listed on their website so it's still relevant I guess. But power scourge is definitely more common these days, I prefer it as well.
---
I think it has to do with Arena working with open sourcing their api or something like that with affiliated websites that do with everything auction house data. Takes a few seconds to sync is my guess on why it does so.
---
In my opinion linking was never a good thing. Some servers gain advantage from relink while others don't, its not balancing anything if some servers go up and down after every relink, while there are servers that don't need to be linked because of their massive player base, but they still get linked and gain even more players.
---
I never understood why this was the way to go.
---
Propably group.
---
Wait. What? You can stop an in-progress "open all"?
---
I’d like to see a blue border around the commanders icon when you’re in a different map/instance.
---
[Perhaps you could use the search function and view the thread asking the same question 2 hours ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/byw41q/will_there_be_a_sale_soon/)
---
So far all of the TV shows we've seen with GW2 merch are Warner Brothers productions, e.g. Silicon Valley on HBO (owned by Warner), Animal Kingdom on TNT (owned by Warner), Big Bang Theory on CBS, and all have access to the same prop shop on the Warner Brothers lot. 
---
You can see the prop shop if you ever tour Warner Brothers studio and my thought is that they have a collection of GW2 merch that's "gamer-y" and gets reserved by set designers for productions like these.
---
I'd say it's the other way around.
---
Griffon is a specialist in fast travel. If you are on a high place and want to get to a faraway place, you use griffon.
---
Skyscale in the other hand is a very good general purpose mount.  If you see a spot you want to get to that would take a combination of mounts to reach, chances are the skyscale can get there directly without extra steps.
---
I enjoy exploring, my problem with TD is I can’t *remember* anything and, for some reason, nothing ever feels familiar. In that situation, the minimap being useless becomes frustrating.
---
The quartz dust is a part of making the kralkatite ingots, you need about as much of that as you do kralkatite but at least that can be bought off the TP, even if the price is still kinda painful lol
---
Yes, but that likely can't happen. Inventory and other panels always appear over dialogs.
---
The only way this could change is if teleporting items got their own exclusive panel in which you can unlock all teleporting items to use them from one place.  
---
and of course select a few favorites to stay at the top of the list.
---
Monk runes are dungeon rewards, though.
---
i am aware. arranging the inventory so it never covers the top center of your screen where every dialogue window ever has appeared in the last 7 years is still the only advise we can possibly give the fella. some more sensible UI design from ANet would surely be welcome, alas their list of things to improve and work on is quite long and filled with far more irritating things. lul at the downvotes btw.
---
Always thankful for people who sacrifice their free time and farm wood brain afk for pushing the prices down for me... &lt;.&lt;
---
Honestly: Dont do that... 
---
(If I dont get downvoted for that I am disappointed. :P)
---
No need for a prompt. Just use playdo for the missing limbs.
---
Griffon is much more worth the effort and gold. In my eyes, griffon is one tier above the rest, including skyscale. Sure, skyscale has its niche, but the effort needed is totally not in line with it's function. I find it incredibly slow in ascending and it's only fun if you find somewhere with loads of volatile magic to eat so you can fly infinitely. Otherwise, it's just a really slow helicopter.
---
Would you rather have a jet plane or a helicopter?
---
I dunno. I play the game. I don't hang out in LA. My gold income is just a trickle. In fact, since I started buying saddle components (and therefore grinding map currencies), my income is net negative. 
---
&gt; Dunno if someone who's threshold for grinding is playing this game's core casual content should be playing this game or at least getting worked up for not getting gold for a convenience mount.
---
Why gatekeep? I've spent almost 1900 hours in the game. Shouldn't my opinion matter too?
---
A homophobe or transphobe (or racist, for that matter) can choose to stop wanting me to not exist. They can renounce their hateful views, and then we can be friends. I know a lot of people who used to be in that camp, or at least closer to that camp. 
---
I can't choose to not be trans. A person of color can't choose to not be their race. There's a difference between those two things.
---
Gotta grind and play 8hrs per days
---
Swear to god if i wouldn't get bored after completing all the new stuff with the new leagues, i would play that game for eternity all day all night.
---
probably a LOT
---
The primary 3 healers are Druid, firebrand, and renegade, with scrapper and scourge as others.
---
The best for raids and probably fractals is harriers gear since it provides a lot of healing power and concentration.
---
I love renegade since it pushes 100% alacrity, and tablet is so mobile, but it’s not great for a group taking much damage.  Druid can pump a lot of might, and firebrand pumps quickness.  Check out snowcrows for raid builds, but be warned they’re optimized with zero margin, and traits may be taken to increase damage very slightly since they’re speed runners.
---
It gives same stuff regardless of your char level. Bags that depend on your char level are better when opened around level 50 or around 30 and that's mostly bag of gear.
---
&gt; I can't choose to not be trans. A person of color can't choose to not be their race. There's a difference between those two things.
---
Who said there isn't?
---
Wait, really? It used to be the only way to get the newer sets was basically getting Ascended/Legendary or else crafting, and crafting the exotics could often be only mildly cheaper than crafting the Ascended.
---
What a good change if I understood this correctly, I can't wait to dive back in.
---
That's even worse then. Congrats?
---
Click and hold on the 1, move your mouse up. Still not as nice as a bundle or all/max button but beats 4 clicks per mat.
---
Not sure if by "leveling" you mean actually going from 1-80, or if you meant gearing/building once you have hit 80.
---
* If you meant the actual leveling process from 1-80, I'd say don't worry too much. At level 80 you have enough points to unlock every trait and every skill, even if you never get any extra hero points from the ones scattered around the maps. Just unlock the skills you think sound interesting, since by the time it matters you'll have them all. It's not really worth trying to set up a proper build before 80, so don't agonise over gear or anything. You can just replace your gear as newer stuff drops, pretty much regardless of stats, but generally greatsword, one-handed sword in mainhand or offhand, or pistol/focus in offhand. Any combination of those will be fine. You can start worrying about getting proper gear when you hit 80 and can get some exotics.
---
* If you're talking about building a mesmer once you hit 80, you'd be best served getting a full set of berserker armor, which you can get by running some dungeons. Citadel of flame, crucible of eternity, and arah all have the option of buying zerk gear. You will probably die a lot at first in that gear, but it's a learning process. Defensive stats don't help as much as they might in other games. For traits you'd probably want to run illusions, domination, and dueling, which is probably what metabattle suggests anyway. This setup just substitutes a few things to be a solid dps chrono as well if you decide to buy HoT.
---
Right!?
---
All the ocx!
---
...He literally says you should be allowed to turn them off, not that they should be deleted.
---
Is there a way to *descend* faster on the Skyscale? I've been finding it VERY annoying when I see an event below me where I want to join in, it seems very hard to *land* unless I use Bond of Faith. I'm used to the Griffin where I can just dive...
---
I only support the Delete Account option if it deletes *their* account and not yours. Otherwise accidentally clicking it would be devastating!
---
This command should only work if you are already on their map, right?
---
The problem with PvE vs WvW is that in WvW you will always have access to at least one way point in the map, while in PvE you don't necessarily have access.
---
Like I said in my post, unless you actively fly that way griffon isn't the best mount in the game and the skyscale is more useful to you. 
---
As for acquisition that depends, some people find a big gold sink shitty, others a big collection. He should be getting both, but for which one first, like I said I think skyscale is the better one. 
---
Since I got it, it replaced griffon very quickly for me and that's why I'm throwing my lot in with the dragon.
---
If you cant be bothered to use the wiki/google/reddit why do we have to guess which rewards you as player may be interested in?
---
Either Buy them all, or take 5 mins and do a little work for yourself and figure out what YOU want!
---
Meta events, raids... Happens often.
---
Edited, thanks!
---
It's to hinder TP bots.
---
Springer jumps significantly faster, so if you're in a hurry it's better.
---
and 80% of springer owners have no clue what a breaker bar is, :(
---
Than you for using your influence for good. It means a lot. &lt;3
---
In the high tier pve endgame the only 3 meta healers are druid, renegade and with a very big asterisk core thief. Forget about core thief, it's only viable on 2 bosses and even then you can play a more offensively oriented version instead of a healer.
---
Druid has been the meta healer for a while now with renegade being an option on certain power bosses if you run a power soulbeast as it can provide frost spirit, a very powerful offensive buff for power classes. 
---
Now, with all this in mind, this only applies to the high end pve spectrum like speedrunning groups and elite guilds. Pretty much any random group should run with a dedicated healer and druid is the preferred option for that simply because it provides key offensive buffs in spotter, frost spirit and storm spirit. Also, you don't have to worry about might as a single druid can very easily maintain 25 might permanently.
---
Is druid the best healer? No, not even close. Firebrand, full heal tempest and revenant pump out insane heals with rev being a bit tricky to play as you don't want to camp ventari. Most people still want one druid though for its offensive buffs. However, if your group decides to play 2 healers then running a second druid is sub-optimal as one druid is usually enough. With a second druid all you really get is 1 more spirit which is not needed most of the time (e.g. frost spirit on full condi encounters), spotter and easier access to fury.
---
Firebrand is amazing for its permaheals and strong defensive buffs like stability and aegis.
---
Herald can provide more fury while renegade can do perma alacrity and has access to soulcleave's summit which loses some of its effectiveness on a fulm heal build as it does less damage. However, it allows you to ignore certain mechanics like retaliation on gorseval.
---
Tempest has multiple variants. Staff has incredible sustained healing and warhorn can also provide decent offensive buffs, especially might.
---
Scourge is what most people would consider to be the pug/noob carry class. You can provide 10man barrier which makes bosses with unavoidable damage (like vg greens) incredibly smooth. You are also the king of resurrects with well of blood, transfusion and to a lesser degree harbinger shroud. You do not provide many offensive buffs though. I would recommend support scourge to any groups that just want to clear as you can recover from mistakes quite easily.
---
I have heard about scrapper heal but i personally haven't seen it much so i won't comment on its viability.
---
As far as gear is concerned, harrier is pretty much best in slot for all healers (except scourge). You can run magi on staff tempest as you don't really provide boons anyway. Generally speaking, you can substitute some harrier pieces for magi if you feel like you need more healing and are topped off on boons or switch in berserkers (or diviners if you need boon duration) if you feel like healing and boons are already more than enough and want to push personal dps.
---
I don't know what's normal but I can only stand about 2 RIBA runs of SW with chest runs after and I make about 25g. I open on a lvl 48 bag opener. Only reason I there right now is because of the meta rush thing because I hate that place from being in there so much because I was making legendaries. I prefer to do Istan meta and meteor farms and consume the kralk for volatile magic and buy the mat crates and sell those. I also do Dragonfall.
---
I actually got two of my old GW2 guildies who quit a few years ago into Warframe recently! They love it. There's even an equivalent to jumping puzzles!
---
&gt; That way aura stackers can keep their looks
---
What looks? Can you actually see them through all the ASD&gt;&lt;DNFNGDM{}GSJHOGBHDFV:"ADVA?
---
Would be nice to have a queue system idd, just to see how many other people trying to get inside the map :D 
---
But on the other side, i think it will be harder to get inside for me... im a good 'join in' spammer ;)
---
Oh and i should remove all the random people i invited to the guild again...
---
as you say.
---
That’s what I do already.  Still want a button.
---
A straight down descend shares the same keybind for drifting on a roller beetle. Check your mount keybinds in the settings if you've forgotten what that is :D
---
&gt; "That a particular specified event or coincidence will occur is very unlikely. That some astonishing unspecified events will occur is certain. That is why remarkable coincidences are noted in hindsight, not predicted with foresight. "                  David G. Myers
---
In other words, extremely rare events happen all the time.
---
Thanks....so much. I've actually been struggling with this a lot. Through role-playing (no erp, just normal rp) on gw2 I've actually started to realize I'm transgender. It been a long few years after that, and I've got a long few years ahead of me. But you're right. I'll fear not this night! Happy pride month!
---
Power Daredevil, power dragonhunter, power reaper, condition soulbeast
---
At a guess either at the start of season 5 or GW2 anniversary
---
Yes. Open all bags of gear with a level 50 character except rares.
---
I actually see a good number of people get on the springer if I mention CC before starting something. It's pretty cool.
---
&gt; Gain health every second; stacks duration.
---
Makes it sound like my example would be 100 health per second, which is why I'm confused. \/u/derek614 says it's 100 healing *over* 5 seconds. In practice I don't feel like ranger's Healing Spring does 2340 health *per second* in healing, but I'm usually melting hard when I use it so it's effects aren't noticeable.
---
gz
---
Holy cow, I'm struggling to reach 35.5k
---
Congratulations, the backpiece looks awesome.
---
And it's not good.
---
Well, you actually don't have to do dmg on Tequatl, participating def events work too (obviously). 
---
And for def event participation, even if you are an afk boon generator, you just need to get retaliation from any random player, which isn't unusual, and get hit by a mob while having, which isn't unusual either, to deal dmg.
---
However, what I said is what Anet said in the update notes back when they changed it, but I can imagine that it actually could work even without dmg.
---
Well that’s largely irrelevant. If people do it for the look, that’s up to them. If you know all the infusions in general, it’s almost like a mini game to sit there and try to figure out all the auras they have.
---
My experiences with Black Desert Online lead me to agree with you in the strongest possible terms.
---
Holding down the Ability 1 key seems to help me descend more quickly.
---
Most things you can do only give 3-5% heart progress. 
---
Bombs are also supposed to fall regularly in the area, and you are supposed to grab them with a water bucket so they get wet and do not explode. 
---
But those hardly ever appear, since it seems they only appear while the bomb-crazed pirates are active, and their events are the first that gets done. 
---
Only the last event counts for the heart too. The one with the champion. The other 5 do not count at all.
---
So the fastest way to get the heart done is actually using the grogs, removing the effects with the water, then going underwater and grabbing 8 shipwrecked supplies.
---
I looked at the rotation for dragonhunter and it seemed like a lot to keep track of (I need the simplest possible rotation for while I learn the mechanics, after that I can branch out), maybe power reaper would be good since I've been playing a lot of reaper recently. Thanks for the reply!
---
Skyscale is definitely the general purpose mount.
---
Just fyi, with the recent world meta event rush thing (I think this is the reason), the lvl you should open gear on is lower like mid 20's currently.
---
Grats :)
---
if you go into solo play, assassins gear mostly outperforms berserker gear, specially if you can stack might ony ourself like a mesmer can.
---
Thanks!
---
Of course when the servers relink every 2 months you will either need to pay gems to keep her moving to your linked server and the next relink is June 28th.
---
Ugh, so jealous. I only just got my final Zenith weapon at 28k.
---
a lot of people say they enjoy or use the griffon more but i've found it's only really useful when you jump off something really high, in every other situation i grab my skyscale, even in some situations where the griffon might be more useful (although those are few). it's kinda fun but if you aren't just flying around the map for no reason then it's pretty useless as if you are doing events in dragonfall or something else then you will have to land frequently and most of the events are not high enough to gain any decent speed. i'd go for skyscale, its more time consuming than the griffon so when you eventually go for the griffon it will be way easier.
---
This is all paradox of tolerance-ey. I'm not saying that being different suddenly give you a pass for being an asshole to anyone you like. OTOH, if someone *is* being an ass, then telling them to shut up or fuck off can't be taken out of context...
---
no, renegade.
---
I main a warrior and do not use banners. Which is why I was trying to jokingly act offended to your "the best" comment. Guess I failed. *sad face*
---
same, and i do. haven't moved my inventory intentionally since the wallet was introduced.
---
Finally reached 39'000 achievement points today and got the "Radiant Backguard" skin.
---
everything in this subreddit gets downvoted, most discussion threads sit at or around 0, fan art and other fluff gets upvoted.
---
The problem is probably one level deeper than the blobs; it's the lack of fight guilds and pugmanders. Many nights there is only one commander on BG, and all of the WvW players flock to the tag. So you end up with one map that's got a queue of 25, and the rest of the maps are deserted.  
---
I have two other accounts on (formerly T1) servers, and the situation there seems pretty similar.
---
i also try and try again to get into eso, but i just can't, not properly... i can't put my finger on what it is, but bethesda have design principles problems it seems to me, either that is because of the console version or something i am not certain, but the design problems that exist in that game are so deep and limiting that its not much of a fun mmo.... itemization issues also, so few interesting items to loot or find.... all the item/armour icons are so similar or exactly the same, the game suffer alot from lack of imagination or something, but its also a really good game with some nice terrain and things that sometimes does feel worth the time and rewarding, but its cetaintly problematic, ive played EQ in 1999, gw1 and aion in 2009, gw2 since 2012 and recently properly got into gw1 (becaause ive not completed it all :P )  
---
so honestly my best reccomendation is guildwars1....  
---
also, other problematic, but quite good mmo's are everquest1&amp;2, both still good, just the subscription service is weird, but its better to join a free trade server and play for free in your own lesuire and depending on how much of an rpg fanatic you are \*Or turn out to be\* then definately you can eek out some pretty cool mmorpg enjoyment out of everquest games, otherwise i tried FFXIV and it was pretty good too, good population too, nice to play a japanese game again... dx12 in a mmorpg is pretty nice, its such a shame eso or gw2 doesn't support dx12
---
easier? yes. cheaper? no. the griffon is still 250 gold, i probably spent about 100 or less on the skyscale, i do not craft i just bought everything necessary on the TP and i did not have any of the stuff you need beforehand, however i did not buy the food that allows you to skip the lost skyscales collection, i just did that normally because it's easy and a waste of gold for the treats.
---
I dunno, maybe? I'm tired of having Enlightened Centrists telling me that taking a side makes me dumb because I'm taking a side, and that the truth is always, always, in the middle. I'm all for compromise and shit, but at some point, I can't equate an argument against a group of discriminated people and an argument for a group of discriminated people. Especially not when the excuse is "hey, but I was able to find shitty people in both groups!"
---
Like, no fucking shit, Sherlock? Wow, now this is news, every group has its assholes? But the thing is, some groups, some arguments, are assholish *by default*. Being bigoted against others because of who they are makes you assholish by default. Even if you never swear, you're being an asshole to others. Just because in that group you're bigoted against you could find a *subgroup* being assholes doesn't make you more justified.
---
The griffon taught me that sometimes we all make mistakes, despite our best efforts, and that all we can really do is learn from them and continue to try our best.
---
Griffen is still worth getting, skyscale is a helicopter able to reach high distances and precise landings
---
Griffen is a jetliner, really fast if you can get the height and the animation feels slightly more polished making it nicer to watch/ride
---
I'd say get it but enjoy the journey, if you have skyscale you're in no rush to get it
---
While I disagree with your point, I understand where you're coming from. To make a comparison to other front page posts, I think this comic is as, _if not more_ on topic than the screenshots from random TV shows, since the GW2 imagery in those screenshots is just background noise as well, at least Commander Gutslurper is something referenced in game.(theres Easter eggs with fanfiction in Season 4) and this comic has precedent of being set in the GW2 world.
---
rebinding mount ability 2 is a massive help with climbing on griffon and drifting with beetle and descending with skyscale.  mount 1 on shift and mount 2 on middle mouse click.  so shift for speed/evade, middle mouse to do something else (dive, drift, descend, etc.)
---
Here's mine.
---
Been playing since betas. Have 8 accounts. Have a character from minute 1 of head start.
---
Own 56 legendaries, about to be 57 once wing 7 is fully released. One of the richest veterans in the game, without having to scam new or inexperienced players (like some do).
---
Over 36k AP, over 400 sPvP rank, consistent plat 3+ rank, over 2000 WvW rank, full masteries.
---
Can be classified to have effectively completed every aspect of the game.
---
All of this while being a full time student and working part-time, and then working full time+ after graduation. Time management and effiency makes magic happen.
---
Are new raid wings usually available right away after the patch time? Or do they delay the start time? Trying to schedule our static
---
kralk meta in dragonfall, griffon is more efficient than skyscale to soul shackle the branded pylons with it's better speed capability around the area and the shrines to teleport to.
---
So, 6/9 classes are able to heal. Only thief, warrior and mesmer are missing out on a healing spec...? 
---
That's pretty neat.
---
Second this 
---
I perform so much better in general as full minstrel firebrand than harrier FB or renegade.
---
Nah, totally married.  When my wife and I were dating we played MMOs (back in 2002-2005) we went to each others house or dorms to game with each other.
---
Amd we used Ventrillo if we had to play apart.
---
Out of all the things you can do in this game, I genuinely think that I'm most proud of getting Barnstormer. Such a fantastic adventure.
---
No, the complaint is not about them winning, if it was them winning people would not be LOSING ON PURPOSE to avoid being against BG. 
---
&gt; This week I logged on for the new week of WvW, KN linked to FA, only to find that we're fighting with SoS and their link for last place to try and get away from BG and their link. 
---
And that is because it's no fun fighting them. No matter what you do when they want something they come take it with 20::1 numbers. Their idea of Havoc is a 10 man squad, and roaming is 5 people.
---
I actually Sang this (typed it) when the map first came out. There was a ton of people on it, it was nice.
---
I would scream
---
Congrats! You character looks great, too. Wish i had that patience, this back is way better than any of the legendaries.
---
Viable healers:
---
Druid, Firebrand, Revenant (both elite specs), Scrapper, Scourge (more barrier than heal), Tempest
---
Our guild had had one every week for many years :) no problems so far
---
That message is why I say fuck it and just vendor a lot of shit.
---
Or you could go Magi's or Apothecary for more DPS. 
---
Crit chance via Magi's is really nice for related sigils and traits.
---
Griffon still best birb. Not-Dragon is close second, but slower. Better when you don't have lots of open space though. 
---
But in general, when in doubt I still go griffon (it also gets the evade when using ability from shared jackal mastery, the not-dragon does not).
---
It's not just nieche, it's a meme-build for min-maxing damage and boon uptime on certain bosses. I would not count it as a proper support spec.
---
Nobody mentioned this yet, but Bladed Armor from Verdant Brink has every stat combo in it now, so it’s an easy way to get starter harrier gear.
---
Obviously, this is not ideal for fractals, cuz you can’t put agony resistance in it, but it’s great for raids!
---
Is it retroactive if I have such gear and haven’t selected the stats yet??
---
Oh, is skill 2 descend? That works, then. Forgot about mount skill 2.
---
It is more niche.  Snowcrows is pretty great for explanations on all that.
---
Yeah been getting that one a lot lately myself didn't used to happen
---
OP would need to purchase the first four LWS4 episodes for 800 gems to get the skyscale. Currently 800 gems costs 264 gold, which is more than the 250 gold needed for the griffon.
---
The difference between this post and those low-quality memes is you only commented on this post to explain why it shouldn't be on the subreddit. Why didn't you have the same energy for those memes? Just admit you're a homophobe with your chest and move on.
---
I just finished my minstrel harrier
---
1. Trinkets: 3 from bitter frost +3 from dragon fall
---
(Very easy, all 6 take no more than 3 days)
---
2. Amors: crafting / stat changing
---
(Quite expensive, almost double in cost)
---
3. Weapon: crafting/elite spec rewards
---
(Axe from FB, shield from Chrono, staff videos)
---
4. Monk, farm AC
---
Keep it up, dude.

---
woah, talk about fashionwars your character looks amazing!
---
&gt; Nobody said it's hard.
---
That's why I used these boys -&gt; "".
---
&gt; you had to have charged quartz, otherwise you are locked for a month.
---
You can buy everything you need in TP for ~70g. You can farm that easily in a day (depending on how and how much you play ofc), however, you are noch locked for a month at all.
---
I went by this data, and while it's neglibile the Jackal indeed runs faster before you consider abilities.
---

---
Last Festival of the Four Winds was also before the introduction of Bond of Vigor, which helped the Jackal's speed quite a bit (you can continously teleport while the endurance regenerates).
---
I managed the lotto for a big guild a few years ago (our average monthly pot was several hundred gold), including an anniversary celebration which gave away a ton of really high value items in addition to a huge gold pot. The only issue I had mailing rewards was the damn mail suppression system.
---
Have fun with your war, then. When you treat everyone outside your group as the enemy. I hope people more level-headed and diplomatic than you prevail, or else the next fifty years won't see a lot more progress than the last fifty.
---
High end PvE tier didnt mean speed run tactic. You could done really fast clear run with any healer + support + dps and experience players in there classes/roles. You might need to ajust some build/class to cover the boons/support needed for the fight but in the end it will fast clear. Just check the challenge done each month by Snowcrow with random classes on random bosses. Those clear are really fast.
---
I started playing around release, played through Scarlet's living story and the fall of LA. Had crafted one character a set of Ascended gear.
---
Decided to quit. Gave all my mats and gold to a good friend. Left the game for like five years.
---
Just started again. Wishing I had all those mats for sure but oh well. Loving the expansions and WvW feels just about where it left off five years ago.
---
I did that event twice. I haven't heard the scream once.
---
Thank you!
---
The game is dead. Don't waste your time. 
---
Anet had mass layoffs and there isn't a new expac coming after the last season, and all  "new" content isn't engaging and has zero replay value.
---
Seriously just play something else
---
fractals, quartz gathering etc there are many ways
---
dragonfall right now is too profitable too iirc
---
When exactly should we expected tommorows patch to be out (central European time)
---
I'd love to see a "Pilots" guild and a big community around Griffon racing. Does this exist?
---
I'm not interested in "the other side" of the debate about whether or not I should be allowed to exist tbh
---
actual fps numbers prove that they do. no matter how many times you deny reality, that won't change.
---
stop whining about people wanting another choice in between seeing your ugly glowstick of a character at 30 fps or seeing ugly generic character models at 60+fps.
---
I think you meant to say GW2 feels awful in comparison to GW1, which is a vastly superior game in every way
---
GW1 is better
---
do they bring any heals besides shouts?
---
Oh I don’t care about infusion stackers. But if enough people complain about it, it’ll be an issue for Anet. I feel like this is the best way to go about it if you were to change something.
---
Griffon is a must-have imo, skyscale, you can do later.
---
I have the skyscale with maxed out mastery for it but i hardly use it. Most of what skyscale can do, a griffon/springer combo can do as well - except of course the hovering part.
---
Maybe we can get the menu option to pop out and grow slightly larger on a hover event.
---
If your support is conditional upon our willingness to sit back and let others trample on our rights then you weren't supportive in the first place and you were never going to be
---
That is still healing.
---
I will shout the hurt away!!!!
---
Anet should not cater to whiners who get triggered by auras that's ridiculous
---
I just hold spacebar down and it autoflaps for me.
---
post proof then. You are flat out wrong and a liar. 
---
AURAS DO NOT AFFECT FPS GET OVER IT
---
Perhaps those posts don’t exist?  I haven’t seen anything like that personally
---
I’m not disagreeing. Anet has no incentive to do so. By making a change like that, infusions lose a lot of value. Thus, less people willing to farm for them, thus less play time.
---
full dps renegade will bring more healing with kalla's elite alone :v
---
What drugs are you on?
---
For fractal Cms *noone* wants a meta comp, you being a healer every time (i should know i main healbrand).
---
A more survivable build uses marauder instead of berserker (replace with valk pieces if you are overcritted). The damage loss is so small noone is able to tell.
---
Also the game is like... Super easy? People go full glass cannon because... Nothing one hits you. Like, really, without anomalies there isnt a single thing that will 100-0 even a low life class like thief or guard.
---
People don't wear defense because it's useless. The baseline defense of the classes is more than enough, why would you drop damage? What's there to gain?
---
Do you want to facetank? Because you will STILL have to move from ground circles, and you will STILL have to CC on party wipe mechanics.
---
how do the fanboys still not realize this is a classic "gotcha" cash grab mobile phone style game? 
---
bUt ItS CoSmEtIc
---
I feel like I am on crazy pills when people defend this crap
---
Yes, but is this done by shouting a lot??? I dont think so there for Warrior is the best healer.
---
One thing i can tell you, since i got my skyscale i don't use either raptor or springer, and almost never use griffon. It's that good. It's alsmost as fast as raptor but on air, and it has built in springer abilities. Of course it's not as fast as a griffon but to take advantadge of griffon's speed you need certain altitude to begin with, which rarely happens on normal gameplay.
---
The problem is that to be able to get your skycale you are probably going to need griffon. Not that it's impossible without it. Either that or a mesmer friend.
---
That is awesome! Are you EU or US?
---
The idea of this really intrigues me, similar to the idea of minstrel guilds. These kinds of things make the game even more amazing. I'd love to watch VODs of Griffon races and see record times of established courses, haha
---
Fewer than that, because just like the armor pieces you again have the choice between the Radiant and the Hellfire version. The second choice is at 42k, which nobody has reached. ([Number 1 is in EU and just short of 40k.](https://leaderboards.guildwars2.com/en/eu))
---
Yeah. Definitely up there with the Spirit Smith backpiece.
---
I'd like to recommend people to pick up GW but whenever I play it seems really empty except the people still spamming in Kamadan, is there a particular time or set of activities that are still more active?  I used to like the Zmissions but I hardly see people doing those either.
---
It boils down to: the map is fucking useless. You have to *actually* explore it to figure out where everything is and how to get there. But on your first run through, trying to do map completion or whatever, it's frustrating as shit because the PoI is RIGHT THERE WHY CAN'T I GET THERE?
---
I still love it now, having run multiple characters through it for map completion.
---
I played ESO in beta, and pretty much had the same sentiment as you mention, but I gave it another go about a year ago, and they've fixed just about every gripe I had with it, and I've found it a nice reprieve from GW2 when I'm feeling like a change. 
---
Then, when I get sick of ESO, GW2 feels kinda like a nice change.
---
... Though, you're right, their vanity prices are ridiculous.
---
This is the right-click menu for *another* player. When you choose "delete account" is't not referring to yours.
---
Then maybe the people who trigger this are exactly those who it was designed against, and not usual players.
---
tbh the hellfire is the rarest cause no fashion sane person would take that first
---
so?
---
Thieves [can heal](https://www.snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/thief/boon/) on Mursaat Overseer and Matthias.
---
Nah don't really like the hellfire backpack. My next goal will probably be the Ultimate Dominator title (currently at 188k/250k).
---
Thank you Monstrum27.
---
It actually works on any mount.
---
So there's nothing to "fix", and this post is meaningless.
---
i never said there was anything to fix, so why are you telling me that?
---
It's not a meme build. It just straight up replaces both Chronos on Matthias and MO, provided that the group can bring a Renegade for alacrity.
---
Boon/Heal Thief isn't a meme build. A Boon/Heal Thief lineup is so much smoother on Matthias.
---
wow, you really are a whiny one, aren't you? you need me to do everything for you? just check your fps with one aura on the screen and then check it with no auras on the screen. that'll give you your proof.
---
to give you an idea of what kind of numbers you should see, here's what I get with only my character on the screen:
---
* no aura: 70-90 fps, occasionally dropping to 60 if I move the camera around
---
* 1 aura: 35-40 fps, occasionally dropping to 30 if I move the camera around
---
Everyone who came back forgot their passwords, and customer support has to verify each and every player with the account.
---
How so?
---
Mesmer might be able to as well. There are some interesting interactions to play with.
---
Thief they can start with making Leeching Venoms scale off the thief's healing power instead.
---
Warrior still has Vigorous Shouts but no longer has banners giving regen :/
---
We are on EU \^\^  
---
And yes! I like such things too! Like the music guilds out there or the beetle guild. Its awesome!
---
It'll be cool if we could get legendary armor from fractals .
---
Wouldn't making queueing easier discourage people from making their own instances successful resulting in fewer people overall successfully completing the meta?
---
Probably :D
---
I had no idea there was a loot bias that way, thanks for the tip!
---
Ty!
---
Scrolls opening *over* inventory has been asked for for ages, since the first scrolls saw the light of day.
---
Sadly, by now most people have sort of accepted that it's not happening, and generally only the True Protectors of Developers bother replying (and voting) on this.
---
Really all they need to do is get rid of tiers.  You don't get more rewards in T1 than T4.  Just set up a round robin rotation where servers are matched based on pop/coverage, but staggered so the same 2 servers don't fight each other more than 2 times every 6 weeks or so.  Simple fix.
---
Support mechanics for PvE - accessible taunts, active damage mitigation skills, something like the old "guard" function from DAoC that allowed tanks to take hits or blocks for the guarded member of the group (% chance)
---
Sanctum of Rall player. We were linked to FA for a time this winter. My bf and I hated Blackgate, him possibly more so than I. Every other week when we'd ascend to the dreaded Tier 1, we hung upour war banners and stuck to PvE. It's just as you've stated, they only fight when they have definitive numbers advantage and often they aren't actually that skilled, they just have a ton of backup. They play whatever seems to be the strongest class for that week, and stack it (just before relinking, it was Daredevils upon Daredevils upon Daredevils). And if they can't take your allied zerg on head-on, they'll start backcapping instead until your numbers dwindle from loss of participation or boredom, and avoid engagement.
---
Given how many people I have accidentally kicked from guild.... I am not sure it is a joke.
---
They just wasted their time making the desert maps. Even though it would be nice to get 2 more variants so all 4 could be different week to week, new maps would be met with similar negativity.
---
Yea I know but I don't really find that as fun as doing the missions and stuff with people, I guess that's mostly what keeps me from playing it now :/
---
Basically warrior tbh. Since boon/heal thief has niche. Minstrel chrono technically can output a fair amount of heals with the added stuff via mantra's.
---
Thank you! :)
---
omg this is amazing xD
---
GW2 has some optimization issues, as in some places with a lot of players there is no system in the world that will be able to run at \~50 FPS.
---
That said, you'll want the CPU with the best single-core performance you can buy, and any GPU above GTX 1060 will offer all the GW2 can offer.
---
I feel I want to ask a thousand questions but I don't even know where to begin. I am *really* enjoying this game so far, just hit level 40 on my ranger last night. So far I am using longbow and sword/warhorn. My ultimate goal is to be a healer druid. I don't entirely know how any of the masteries work. I just keep plugging in my hero points and hoping it's right. :P I am considering buying the two expansions in the bundle with blue gems. Do I have an actual question in here somewhere?!
---
I get so much loot and I don't know what to do with 80% of it. Can I share it with alts via the bank?
---
Can I sell gear I have worn on the trading post once I buy the game?
---
How hard is it to "break into" end game as a new player? 
---
When should I run dungeons?! What will people expect of me in dungeons?
---
Basically I just run around doing events. I try to complete the objectives of each zone before moving on. I am starting to feel not very powerful in the world - maybe a gear issue?
---
if you're just going to keep crying about that, enjoy the block.
---
Ok, thanks mate
---
The desert map is quite old. They did do some fix up prior to re-implementing it (and some post-fix ups), namely removing the pve aspect of the map.
---
It's still super easy to get into Air keep without having to use siege to break in. They fixed some spots but others remain unfixed.
---
No, I'm the old one, I assure you ;)  12 minutes can fly by when we're having fun, but it feels like an eternity when I'm standing around waiting for pirates to pass out just so I can throw water on them and maybe wake them up, if they don't wake up on their own.  guh.  It's just a dysfunctional heart.  No comment on priority though.
---
Maybe. But making it spammy and impossible to tell if the map is totally full leaves people just trying over and over.
---
I think having some way in lfg to visualize which maps are full, as well as whether your own map is full would help. Too often I find that people waste time switching to all the "not full yet" lfgs which are already full..
---
Race to the bottom didn't work last week -- thanks to that Tier 2 tie lol.
---
Ok so inventory space is easy to deal with nowadays.
---
- top right of inventory hit that gear button and press deposit materials
---
- buy salvage kits from merchants, basic for greens and blues, master or mystic for yellows, if you have black lion salvage for exotics or master/mystic if not.
---
- items you've worn (that become soulbound or account bound ) can't be sold on TP. But salvaging of you can any items to sell their materials 
---
- once you have TP (trading Post) most people sell all materials they don't need or exotics that sell for a 1g or more
---
          - I bought copper fed salvage o matic from gem store, I use it on my greens and blues and deposit/sell on TP the materials
---
          - I use mystic on yellows and deposit/TP materials
---
          - I use BLSK (black lion salv kit) on exotics
---
          - all exotic (orange) bags I open on a lvl 51 character and then salv/ TP / deposit materials
---
Edit: when I get to a laptop I'll reformat
---
I hated that too D:
---
(Then I got a salvage-o matic and just grind down everything. And nowadays with the unid gear patch I'm not even sure what could there be so many of to sell.)
---
If I sell 10 items too quickly this happens.  10.
---
Congrats, that is by far my favorite back piece. I am nowhere close, only at 26,000 something, but it is also a goal.
---
If you are alt-tabbing, you might miss the shout.
---
Literally anything.  It only takes selling 10~15 items in quick succession.
---
He is not wrong. Can't be unseen once you see the backpack from [behind](https://imgur.com/a/MU0BzLf).
---
You missed compact inventory.
---
*Shivers*
---
They had to increase account recovery security from that time Gaile Grey had her employee account stolen.  The customer service rep gave her login and pass to someone who managed to provide answers to simple account recovery questions (from back then).
---
Awesome thank you for all the information. I don't know if you can join guilds across servers? My 2 partners are playing as well but I have advanced the most. :3 I am gonna try a dungeon today!
---
i admit it can require compromises with 200+ slots, but i never ran into any issues with the pre-PoF limit of 160 + shared inventory on a 1080p screen.
---
Well, if you're on NA, then you could join. It doesn't matter which world you're on except for WvW. Which means, if you're on NA, you can play with anyone else on NA regardless of which world they're on, unless you're playing World vs. World. Then you can only play with people on the same world as you. They would be welcome to join as well. Well good luck! If you're having a hard time finding people, feel free to hit me up in game (if you're in North American servers), and I'll jump in if I'm on.
---
Thank you so much! That makes sense about the level 51 opening thing. I cant wait to be able to explore the TP. I am not gonna respond to all your points but I have read them and am taking them in. I actually have no idea how to add people with a tag? Mine is bunny.1345 I think.
---
true!
---
Rikkiti is a girl Skritt?
---
Thank you, good to know. :D
---
SO many of us would pay for that...
---
If you want it to run well you just have to pray your CPU likes the game and then use the DX11 mod to improve your FPS further. My old desktop with a GTX 650 and an FX-4300 processor performed the exact same as my R9 390X GPU with an FX-6350. The gap in specs there is so massive that some games would have twice the FPS on the new desktop but GW2 ran about the same.  
---
I've seen some people with even older rigs that outperformed mine and newer rigs that outperformed mine, as well as older and newer rigs that ran worse than mine. It's almost like the game just assigns your PC an FPS target at random when you first install the game.   
---
What's more of a joke is most of the settings hardly even impact your FPS so you can run every single setting (except render scale, player count, post-processing and shaders) at lowest and highest with at most a 5% FPS change between them.   
---
Long story short you'll probably hit that FPS pretty easily but don't expect to play the game with an FPS average higher than 60 and don't expect to stay around 40-60 in large WvW battles or with other heavy player count. Just install the DX11 mod, make sure your CPU is cooled well and clear out your cache about twice a year after big patches and you should be fine.
---
&gt;edit: what's with the downvotes on this thread? Practically every top-level sat at 0. Some people, jeez.
---
Toxic casuals who hate their opinions being challenged. They want to believe that Skyscale is the greatest thing ever made.
---
I am learning PvP as well.  I have almost 500 games as ranger now, and I still learn something new every game I play.  And when I jump onto a new profession, I am just as lost as when I started.  It's a complex game, but learning it can be a lot of fun.
---
Some claims here are incorrect. You should open them on low lvl characters. It however varies, so this site will help you [https://silverwastes.loltools.net/](https://silverwastes.loltools.net/). So  medium class 49-53 is ideal. Even if you do Dragonfall, you still end up with champ bags that you should open on the low lvl char.
---
Would be helpful if the map tells you how many ppl is with you in the same map. Most of the meta can be done with a squad less than 10, but with the map size too big to catch everybody in sight, I feel a lot of chance of completion is lost in hope.
---
Always 40-60fps impossible.
---
20-30fps mínimum (three server  Zerg battle) with no effect LoD active (so it doesn’t remove  objects from the game  very important in wvw) I get it with an 9700k OC to 5.3ghz and an rtx 2070 OCed. 
---
Graphic card is not that important but it helps to lift up the minimum. 
---
If you wait for the new amd Zen2 you should be able to expend much less to get the same performance. Go for the micro which gets at least 5Ghz.  
---
I don’t think it can’t get much better because at this point the bottleneck is also the GW2 server.
---
I see, thank you
---
&gt; They'd be better of just taking Alpine, moving dirt, grass, and some trees around then call it new.
---
Agreed. They should just put the Alpine map back for Red.
---
Right. I've got 57% boon duration at the moment I believe. I think that should be good for the moment.
---
digital river is dodgy and has been known to do stupid things in the past, just contact support, they should be able to help you out.
---
Anet doesn't care in 1st place 
---
And people want easy win on BG 
---
Its been always like that .
---
Imagine giving Kain empty server like DR and giving black gate ex host server Maguma with huge pug population 
---
Because Anet think from their Ass and they don't even play the game 
---
We are all beta tester for everything they release, keep crying and complaining they respond eventually maybe in 2027
---
Link system is always random and they keep refusing to show server population charts because they don't have one in 1st place
---
Later cub!
---
Part of the context you're missing is that this is related to the Tyria Pride event being put on by Gamers Giving Back. 
---
This is part of that community effort, for a community event, in the game we all enjoy.
---
So this is definitely GW2 related.
---
I do get your point on how GW2 subreddit should be guild wars 2 stuff, but you said it yourself - Commander Snargle is in fact cannon in the GW2 universe (those books in PoF - use /wiki in game if you wanna search it), so by that very definition, this comic is nothing BUT GW2.
---
So, yeah. Snargle = GW2, and that message and the fact that this gaming community feels so strongly about these topics and defend them so readily is what makes Guild Wars 2's community so special. 
---
This community raised $6k for cancer research last year. This community provides a brilliant place to make friends, enjoy a game together, and make lasting relationships. Couples of all sexualities meet through this game.
---
So, really, LGBTQ is a GW2 thing. Because the game includes trans characters, lesbian characters, and other LGBTQ representation. 
---
This message is definitely Guild Wars 2.
---
"Not giving a shit" =/= "not homophobic". 
---
At the same time, "not giving a shit" =/= "being an ally".
---
There's a real fine line in there to walk, that's for sure, and it's tiring to figure it out. But it is worth it to the people in your life who are LGBTQ. And you have some, that's for sure. You just might not know it.
---
He bought it off the GW2 website. Forgot to mention when I attempted to buy it with my details it got rejected twice. It worked with his details.
---
Official GW2 website.
---
First of all, those aren’t masteries, those are skills and traits you are unlocking with hero points. Masteries mostly have nothing to do with combat, and come with an expansion and once you hit lvl 80.
---
Second, druid is a elite specialization for rangers that come with HoT, so you’ll need that expansion to play it. 
---
Third, I highly recommend starting the game with a dps character. This is because it’s the first time you’re doing story, map completing, etc. most of the time, you’re going to be solo. As a heal druid solo, you’re basically an unbreakable rock, but you won’t be killing anything. I made this exact mistake myself, and it made open world and story a horrible experience for me. You say you’re starting to feel weak, and druid won’t help that. From personal experience, a good dps class will destroy enemies WAY quicker than druid. For me, it was from 3000-5000dps to 20k dps (numbers aren’t exact). With recent druid nerfs, it’s probably even lower. This means way easier time in open world and less of the “dammit another mob to waste 10 seconds on” type of feeling.
---
Another reason you might not want to go for heal druid is because how supports work in this game. You may have heard gw2 doesn’t have the trifecta of dps, tank and support. Instead, much of endgame stuff requires strict support comps to achieve crucial boons and unique buffs. Druid, although a solid choice half a year ago, is kinda in an iffy place right now. It’s still meta in a lot of places, but has seen repeated nerfs that is slowly pushing it out of favor. In my opinion, you should wait until you understand what you want to do (casual open world, wvw, fractals and raids, etc.) and gear the support class needed for each content, as each content requires a different support composition. If you’re set on the content you want to do and want to play support really badly, I can help you choose a build, but I doubt that’s the case. 
---
The best dps you can get with ranger is as [power soulbeast](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/power/). Soulbeast is the pof elite specialization for ranger. Even without soulbeast, try to match the build to the build linked. Get that longbow out if you can. Longbow has garbage dps. Put in a greatsword and replace warhorn with an axe. Match the traits best you can, and go for any traits that boost your damage where you can’t match the guide. Make sure all gear has +power, +precision or +ferocity as their stats. These will boost your dps the most. The best damaging skills you have are greatsword (gs) 2 and axe 5. Gs5 resets the cooldown of gs2. Never use the signet; it’s passive effect is what gives you damage. If you want more help with rotations and builds and such, ask any questions :D
---
100%
---
If you cannot sell materials or crafted gear for end game, then crafting is nothing more than fluff.  Way too much stuff in this game is account bound - there are tons of ways to get ascended gear in this game, and making things easy is part of the appeal of GW2. I do not understand why buying on the TP is not one of those options.
---
I have a faint memory that this was actually a removed event that was basically a city tour (which would have a similar function). I think it was mentioned in some pre-release stuff and you occasionally used to be able to see the event text even though you couldn't participate.
---
There is definitely nothing against this in the ToS. ArenaNet has some fairly sensitive anti-fraud measures in place when it comes to payment. They automatically shut down accounts to protect them if these automated systems are triggered.
---
Just open a support ticket and explain the situation.
---
yeah that really helps your argument I totally believe you now
---
This is not the support. Ask them.
---
Any post claiming their "friend" got banned for nothing is suspicious. Why is it always someone else getting banned? And why is it always for nothing? And why are you asking the most uninformed ones of the situation why this friend got banned?
---
I'm not saying what you claim isn't true but there are a huge amount of examples where people hacked on an alt and somehow think that getting people's sympathies on reddit is somehow gonna change that.
---
To stop people from wasting their time on a dead game
---
I’ll take that argument. Actually anything, so I won’t be sad that I will never own this thing
---
Oh! You can do it we believe! :p
---
I've responded to a few of your other comments, but your thought process is actually really similar to mine - just a different result.
---
Would you be open to having a discussion about it? 
---
For more context, I'm really interested in exploring the "if you're not actively helping, you're the enemy" part. I totally get that and I think that it is certainly a true statement to say that it is all-or-nothing and certainly is not appropriate in all cases.
---
But in my mind, general human rights is not one of those cases. (exceptions being when say the human in question is a mass murderer or terrorist - I do think restricting certain rights of that individual may be necessary for the safety of the common good)
---
If you're good with chatting it out, I'd love to. I'm not looking to change your mind or anything with this - just hoping for a good discussion where I can try to understand a little more. 
---
Thanks. :3
---
multiple attempts prolly caused an automated fraud countermeasure. should be an easy thing to solve with support
---
Power dragonhunter is great because you don't have a hard and fast rotation, but more a priority list for what skills to hit. As long as you're keeping aegis / retaliation uptime and standing on a symbol, you're probably fine, and those conditions are pretty simple to hit.
---
Sincerely, a mechanically inept DH main
---
Oh yeah, I was talking only about the Dragonfall currency. The most time consuming had to be sandswept isles, because map completion and hearts give very little, so you have to rely on farming the nodes. I have to say, I like the map and it has very pleasant scenery, so it wasn't THE most annoying for me. I think Jahai Bluffs was the worst, but I finished it quickly because I started with it first.
---
Damn... You need to learn let go, dude..

I highly recommend Dragonhunter as it's the simplest rotation out of the meta tier for Fractals and Raids. Once you understand the concept behind DGH's rotation (stack all your damage boosting skills/traits/boons then unload your biggest hitters), you'll realize there's not much to it and it's very easy to recover if you make a mistake.   
---
Daredevil's rotation **is** easier, but while DD is meta for Raids, it isn't as meta for Fractals.   
---
Reaper is fine to **start with** but keep in mind it's not meta for Fractals and Raids. If you're going to learn Fractals and Raids, might as well give yourself the best advantage you can get by learning a meta class. It kinda sucks to already start at a disadvantage by playing a sub-optimal class.

On Griffon I invested 250g like everyone else, on Skyscale I invested less than 70g IIRC, like most of us who got all the episodes when they were available. Due to the fact that OP needs 4 more episodes which is 800gems, in gold value he will require more golds to spend for the de-facto total price to unlock Skyscale. That's what I meant by "It will be cheaper to unlock Griffon at this point in OP's case" as he just has to cruise through PoF only. For Skyscale you actually need also to unlock Sun's Refuge which adds to the time invested as well.

luckily i already had the charged quartz. at one point i was crafting 2 sets of celestial gear but only crafted 1 set and had a lot of leftovers. i didnt have enough to make smelly treats to skip the jumping puzzles, but none of them were hard and i ended up solo'ing them all.
---
the 6x stacks of map currency took me 4 days. the worst offender was the 4x feeds per day, it was the easiest part to do, but having to wait 24 hours with absolutely nothing to do (except map currencies in advance) and seemed like the biggest waste of time with just 30 seconds of work and nothing until the next day.
---
I never claimed anywhere in my post that he was banned for nothing. He has obviously been banned over a misunderstanding. There has been no hacking whatsoever going on. Please pull the stick outta your butt.
---
If you're in EU you can check some of the other countries in EU on that list.

I’d prefer just not having links be more than 1 week, maybe 2.  It would get rid of all the bandwagoning

OP here to explain the point. Basically, I shared my story around GW2 in hopes to get others to share their own.
---
I tried to make it as obvious as possible as to what it was in the title, and I did leave a note that it was long. If anything, you probably shouldn't have read this at all if all you were going to ask for is for your 5 minutes back (which I can't do, because I'm not some magical time wizard).
---
i've used renegade condi/healing can be useful on 100%-&gt;75% sunless world boss. blocks projectiles that drop deadly aoe and dispel fear if people dont dodge it. the aoe when he raises his hand isint deadly just debuffs you
---
Amber’s laugh omg

Straight up Halloween witch laugh.
---
Meta for ranged Deimos? Other than that...
---
Where did he buy the the key from?
---
If it’s from Arena Net he payment could’ve been stopped and in that case they can ban the account.
---
Actually guardian(firebrand), revenant(herald or renegade), engineer (scrapper), boon thief, elementalist (tempest), necromancer (scourge), can all heal as well (for raids), not just druid, so pick which you want. As far as fractals go usually heal firebrand is currently the meta for average pug groups.
---
what's the difference between Silver and Copper Salvage O-matic? I mean, I understand one uses silver and one uses copper on each use but does the copper one salvage rares and exotics? do you get better broken down mats from the silver??
---
Shortbow slaughters defiance bars with the #4 poison field daze, you don't need sword/pistol for that. For some open world stuff, deadeye is probably not bad, but it's not a spec I'd really like to see in fractals. Horrible cleave, poor CC when using reasonable weapons and very little utility for the group. Not to mention that I expect most pug deadeyes either to spend most time on the floor or somewhere at range where they'll be totally useless.
---
I also get an error by just opening the TP. It also annoyinly pops the error a few times, while the TP takes forever to load.
---
This tends to be worse in the evening.
---
Wait, does it literally slow you down while you're pulling up? Or are you saying that it's silly because you'd think S (backwards) to slow you down?
---
Oh please you realize your in the minority when you try to say anything you don't like is called crackpot now right? Grow up those terms don't work anymore this shit is proven right in your face stop being ignorant no one wants your ignorance around get that shit out of Reddit your not helping the world because you choose to ignore something just because it's negative.
---
Yep, her event is called "Escort Rikkiti as she brings a message to the Lionguard assault force"
---
OH lmao.
---
You can evade with the Skyscale using mount ability 1 with the shared jackal mastery iirc. It also gives you a burst of speed, making it go faster when you're just flying in a straight line, and is on demand rather than tied to your flapping mechanics like the Griffon.
---
Dumb question but how do I access the chests [here](https://i.imgur.com/lcuirca.png) in thunderhead peaks? I have no idea. I've already done the story and remember I had to assemble some sort of plate to get access. The NPC (Frodak) doesn't help me either. Wiki says I just simply have to stand in front of the green gate but that doesn't work either. Any help?
---
how is gathering 250 currency in 6 maps taking only 1-3 days?.. you'd have to have quite a few characters to do it that fast, and alot of time. 
---
A newbie is not gonna that many lv80 characters....
---
It's taken me almost 3 weeks, to go from 0 map currency to 250.
---
There are 2 kinds of impacta. One dissapeaes after you kill it.
---
we all do, buddy
---
This can be interpreted as cute or......... something very wrong. a different type of "mount" training.......  Let's just hope that skyscale is female
---
How do you keep your cool during very messy raids?
---
You give Anet far, far too much credit. These match ups are a blip in some program, Anet human involvement in WvW is nil. I find it funny to imagine Anet EVER looks at match ups and thinks ANYTHING. They look if something malfunctions and only THEN if an uproar is made in the main forums. 
---
Though your reasoning for the ridiculous length of time they are taking for alliances makes a bit of sense. They will definitely want to monetize it somehow. But then, its a business, that is to be expected, to a degree.
---
The reality is as unchanged today as it was years ago. WvW is not on their radar unless its something gimmicky. Hoping maybe that they have a full staff working on the game in general again instead of the skeleton staff they've had for years...maybe, if we are really optimistic, we can maybe wonder if something significant comes to WvW...but really, who am I kidding....
---
Save yourself from frustration. If you have too much heart in wvw you are bound only for disappointment.
---
It doesn't prevent any bot, it only negatively effects the "real" players. Time isn't that important for a bot, they can wait and sell in order not to get capped. But selling quickly improves QoL for a human user.
---
They won't address it.
---
I have about 70 ppl in my friend list... almost every is a missclick
---
You should do the Master challenge, since you're already basically there! (maybe you've already completed it?)
---
Give them a chance. Give feedback. Ask X to do Y when Z happens. If that fails...
---
"Thanks for the try, but I'm going now". 
---
If you don't think you'll succeed and you're not enjoying the process, then why are you still there? You lose nothing if you step down from an unwinnable battle, especially if you're not enjoying it. 
---
Be polite, wish them well and go and do something else.
---
So the reason for all those really incredibly incompetent druids out there is people like you, telling players that druid is easy.
---
Got it. You know the reason I hear the most when asking why commanders want 2 druids? Its "because most druids are dogshit, so you need 2 for semi okay boons".
---
Sorry, but I simply can not agree with you. Every healer is incredibly easy if you take the time to look at the build and raid mechanics. And every healer is incredibly bad if you dont take the time to learn both.
---
Thats just how healer builds work in every game.
---
What's wrong with someone asking the question? You are free to just move on rather than being a jackass about it.
---
I love that I have this little Ryty. One of the best plushes I've ever gotten. 😋
---
Thank you for posting, this was incredible to watch and very inspiring!
---
That's very wholesome, SNARGLE GUTSLURPER
---
If you don't have enough gold, just choose skyscale.
---
Left audio channel only = instant cringe for headphone users
---
Get your API key and check GW2efficiency.com. You can use the Crafting page there to generate a shipping list.
---
I don't see why we get limited like this. I could understand limits for the f2p folks but not for people who are clearly invested in the game ie: owns all expansions, above a certain ap count.
---
Every class can be a healer, but not every class can be a good healer. Warriors have healing shouts and used to have banners grant regeneration, Thieves have leeching venom and can give all boons with certain stolen skills, and Mesmers can heal with mantras and wells (both the healing well and all wells with the healing well trait). Out of them all, I'd say chronos are the closest of the three to being able to be called a good healer.
---
So does everyone here still clinging on to this rotting corpse of a once good game
---
Thanks for the info! How much do u make an hour from dragonfall, Istan, and Mat crates?
---
Alliances badly done will not be good.
---
On paper anything is simple.
---
Just FYI the official API is borked right now so any fansite like efficiency will have issues displaying correct prices and counts.
---
i purchased all of mine with mag shards and winterberries.  One thing I'll point out is that you can be very effective in WvW / Raids as a support firebrand in non minstrel exotic gear.  I ran this build in WvW / Raids while I was gathering the minstrel pieces...pretty cheap, very effective.
---

---
As for the weapons I did the firebrand / chrono collection for axe / shield and I got the staff as a drop from raids.  Armor was entirely mag shards.
---
Looks like dragonfall is becoming really popular now, thanks a lot
---
I'm still hoping for a unicorn skin that vomits rainbows
---
I don't doubt you, honestly I don't have any more advice than "contact support" since we can't do anything for you.
---
But what he meant was people claim "I got banned for doing nothing" or "my "friend" got banned for doing nothing" all the time. In a lot of the cases they actually did goldselling, botting etc. It's just an excuse as old as time really.
---
Standing in front of the gate on the upper floor gives you the Point of Interest at [The Hammer's Hoard](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Hammer%27s_Hoard).
---
To actually open the treasure rooms, you need to do both meta events (north meta = [Light of Deldrimor Plate—Top Half](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Light_of_Deldrimor_Plate%E2%80%94Top_Half), south meta = [Light of Deldrimor Plate—Bottom Half](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Light_of_Deldrimor_Plate%E2%80%94Bottom_Half)) + combine the two items received (once daily per account) to create a [Light of Deldrimor Plate](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Light_of_Deldrimor_Plate). Or you can buy either part or the whole thing on the TP.
---
Speak to the dwarf once you have an assembled plate; he swaps it for a special action skill, and also drops a coloured access key plate on the ground for you. Take whichever key to the matching room, do the puzzle in the room to get to the other side + repeat until you end up with the Green key. There's hidden chests (2 in each room) rewarding a random rare unid too.
---
*All of this is on the wiki at: [Dwarven Room Raider](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dwarven_Room_Raider)*
---
And yet I can buy to my heart's content at rapid speed and not get errors....
---
&gt; No maps prior to PoF maps were made with mounts in mind.
---
FTFY
---
They also don't have a reason to.
---
Thanks for your response, man. I was just wondering one more thing if you wouldn't mind me asking, does the personal story end once I hit level 80? (And if it does I assume thats when I should watch season 1 and buy season 2?)
---
In theory, they could prohibit queueing if you don’t have any of the WPs unlocked... people could WP to a friend on a non-queued map to unlock still.
---
Thanks ! Finally. 2 years later I've got an answer. XD I don't know why I didn't think to ask here. This "event" drove me crazy a couple of times. I've asked in /map but only had jokes in return.
---
You mean DX12 not 11
---
He is referring to d912pxy
---
It actually has boosted my frames rather considerably as well. Of course I imagine it requires a dx12 compatible card. There are still some bugs but it’s gotten a lot better since it’s launch. The creator also worked with the maintainers of arcdps and gw2 radial to allow all three mods to be used together via chain loading. In my experience it’s also compatible with reshade/gw2hook and TacO
---
Link if you are interested: https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy
---
How many hours do u think you’ve played so far?
---
If you want the full list I'd actually recommend using gw2efficiency for the recipe list.
---
&gt;didnt expect or didnt know can happen (there are expected errors and unexpexted), so when this error is occuring anet also doesnt know whats wrong and what could pottentialy be displayed to the user
---
That's not how it works, since programming isn't black magic. Even rudamentary error-catching requires the knowledge of what you are catching for and when you are catching for it. So when there's any error message of any sort, then the program is actually aware as to why it happened and could tell you why. At the very least you would get the type of error and knowing which particular function it originated from. The reason why it is not disclosed with the user is either because of safety reasons (web services in particular) or because most users wouldn't know what it meant anyway.
---
The kind of errors you didn't know could happen or expected are the ones that would crash the program or degrade it without throwing an error.
---
I mean being locked out of content that was released after LS1 because you didn't play LS1 is more than enough reason.
---
Raising 2 IRL and now going through the same in the game where we are supposed to get some rest and distract ourselves from the real life...
---
Oh I see, it’s like a hp train but with events
---
People whisper that heal mirage is the new meta and high end guilds try to hide the insane build.
---
Caution: Clonespam
---
A movie called Superhero Movie, I think.
---
You're new so its natural to not do that well at the start.
---
but couple tips since power dagger is my main in pvp.
---
1-use the mobility from gs3 and gs5 and bull's charge to hit to keep chipping on people.
---
2-the best trait arguably for SB warrior is Magebane Tether ( here is the wiki link https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magebane_Tether_(trait_skill) )
---
3- so the goal is to chip on people , knock them down and keep moving around to get the adrenaline then using arcing slice to hit as many enemies , use the spell shield whenever you have it aswell as it also reset the cooldown on burst skills. one of the basic combos that are really good is bulls charge into 100blades arcing slice maybe after that you can use shield bash too but you got to time it really well ( you cant finish the hunderblade if you wanna do the whole thing)
---
4- dagger and shield also have really good mobility, boon strip and of course the block , so you gotta figure when you need to switch to that.
---
5- most important thing is you need to realize even though you can deal an absurd amount of damage and have really good sustain with the build, you also have great mobility and should be roaming to capture points when needed.
---
6- Finally Don't fight a Mesmer 1v1 you're just going to die, try and make it out and regroup with teammates.
---
4 hours longer than the last guys who posted this same question today
---
You don’t need friends, just join a squad and use it to get to a random that is in a map you haven’t unlocked :). Just confirm they are in the map you need before using it!
---
Sounds like your bank to be honest. Think that's the error you get when they don't authorise the payment.
---
&gt;please try again later
---
this
---
I had this problem, open a ticket and they will fix it.
---
The mastery with the dive and you become an F-35 jet. Also, there's griffon courses, they're pretty fun.
---
Suggestion: Get Captain Airship Pass. You basically start in the sky in Gendarran fields and you can just zoom down and max speed across the whole map. Really fun!
---
Am I in the wrong sub or are you in the wrong sub?
---
They recharge for 800 gem
---
That gets boring after a while (trust me, I have it) 😄
---
And when I try to identify on official forum I got this one : 
---
Whoops!
---
HTTP Error communicating Code: 400
---
WTF Anet lol
---
You're not locked out, it'll just take you a little longer.
---
Griffon is 250, skyscale is 35 plus some mats, depending on what you already have.
---
If you lost a fight in Stronghold because of Overtime, it was not Overtime's fault, it was yours.
---
It should be stated that they can restore a snapshot of an account/character from a specific date. They'll also monitor the transaction of items leaving your account. Don't worry too much about what's on your account. It would be restored. Hope you get your account back soon.
---
What did you expect from a game run by blue haired SJWs with a case of fishmouth?
---
Finally i could open a ticket xD
---
...
---
I mean unless the cooldown is random, it'd be pretty easy to write a bot that does that anyway
---
You might have a browser issues outside of gw2, the gem store is actually an external browser integrated with the gw2 client.
---
But we know they can queue actions in the backpack/ui. Why would it be so hard to queue the sales so they automatically get sold technically one stack at a time but only require one click of a sell all menu item.
---
Options -&gt; Sounds -&gt; uncheck "Mute when GW2 is in background"
---
Problem solved?
---
Probably accidentally triggered a anti-fraud bot.  Support should be able to get you fixed up.  They are usually pretty good about it.
---
Sorry, mustve missed it. Thanks though, now I know it'll be over four hours lol
---
Congrats :) enjoy the radiant back, one of what 100ppl able to choose/have one.
---
No, I get that. I'm just confused why you said mercy runes were a good replacement for monk runes if on a budget.
---
These are all great suggestions. They really could have made the skyscale a bat and saved the dragon design for an actual legendary mount.
---
Can you link me to that WvW alliance update?
---
I've found that with most pug T4's, harriers are actually overkill in healing and Magi's are better at running T4's faster
---
that sounds ridiculous; do whisper more sweet sweet lullabies.
---
Harrier's is actually overkill for raiding, too. 
---
You just want to get your Grace of the Land might duration to about 16-18 seconds, then the rest can be invested into other stats (such as Magi's for more healing and crit).
---
The only thing you'll be lacking a little is fury and other boons, but thankfully spirits also have very high base boon duration now, too. As do pets.
---
