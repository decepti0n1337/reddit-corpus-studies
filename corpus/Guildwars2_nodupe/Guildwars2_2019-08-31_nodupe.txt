Imagine actually being there in person for that annoucement, holy shit
---
---
---
&gt; That is only needed for expansion level or equivilent content
---

---
This is why I'm frustrated. They went above and beyond a "normal LS announcement". Once you raise the stakes you have to know your audience will expect something huge. If it was a normal stream in their office then we would've known what to expect.
---
What are you talking about. Personally I haven't spend a dime since PoF, just didn't feel worth it.
---
They did clarify on the forums that "mini-seasons" would likely be variants like 2v2 and 3v3, etc.
---
I found the end weird, i think they should have put it between the recap from Mike Z and the final Saga announcement, that way would make more sense I think.
---
Phantasy Star Online 2 is releasing in the west in spring of 2020...
---
Amazon is working on a LotR mmo (no release date).
---
Camelot Unchained is coming out soon (I think a spiritual successor to Dark Age of Camelot? Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong on this).
---
More upcoming projects that seem cool are Blue Protocol and Project BBQ. I think Ashes of Creation is supposed to get a Battle Royale game and a full mmo.
---
Those are all I've got on my radar currently, but there are WAY more that are being worked on that might appeal to you more than they have to me! :)
---
Nintendo comes to mind too. 
---
Nintendo: Metroid Prime 4 was looking like it might suck, so we delayed it so in won't. 
---
Everyone: Oh... yeah, that's probably for the best.
---
This wouldn't be the case if the reveal was good, but it wasn't, don't blame the community, arenannet knew damn well what to expect.
---
I feel that's misrepresenting it a fair bit.
---
I've not seen many people who said that what was shown was **bad**. *Disappointment* creeps in from the fact that this was done via a build-up and an actual meet-up. Suggesting something bigger than it turned out to be.
---
Now, even more so than without the previous lay-offs, wouldn't a company already struggling to get back on its feet **not** want to spend extra money **and** time (therefor stressing the remaining workers) organizing something they **know** will just disappoint the players?  
---
All they've shown/said a blog post + a video could have presented exactly as well, and they could have saved themselves a lot of money in the process and a few people could have gone home earlier.
---
None... yet :P  
---
Note: I do not expect any gems or hope to get any.
---
For me it's been wanting more Charr focus. So visiting the homelands will be great
---
builds are made by ners who like to theorycraft, hardcore players play too much to be able to calculate.
---
Nice spot. I took her for a Commander as well.
---
Female Commander x Jormag confirmed
---
"Free" stuff is just selling stuff at a 100% discount, which would still be flagged if the item in question is illegal to sell or highly regulated. I'm not in the same line of work as ANet, but we do sell products for "free" to customers along with an unofficial agreement with them to buy other products. The "free" items are still treated as normal sales and are subject to all applicable regulations. Free isn't really free.
---
From what I heard some of the more senior devs decided to be let go to let newer talent stay there. You can argue if it was based on money but I heard multiple sources say this.
---
Thanks
---
lmao
---
Those mini seasons is all I ever wanted. Several funny game modes where you just jump in with some friend and have a good time for some rounds. Sure you could already do that in hotjoin but the mode is so flawed and the rewards so non exsistend that you find almost none actually playing it.
---
Conquest is fine. That balance is directed at conquest is fine. Having to play conquest for 7 years only is not fine. So I really hope this comes and is not canceled.
---
Reverse psychology works.
---
It makes utter sense to make a mobile game. Don't you guys have phones?
---
It was a sarcastic post which brings out some good points, I don't mind spending money, doesn't bother me a bit if content is "good" or reasonable. In some content it's worth spending and some isn't.
---
Fun fact: this commander was made as one of Joko's lovers.  
---
This commander has no concept of dignity. Just like me.
---
This is the perfect description.
---
Tbh, when you account for the fact that we were constantly being let down for several months, a complete lack of communication from gw2 devs and a huge hype creation around 'hey, we have a trailer, one good one meh and one shit funkos, and a guy in a black poncho,' I'm suprised the backlash is this timid.
---
People who have put thought into their argument won't ever say that Living World isn't content. It's just that we feel two things: 1) LW content isn't appealing when you factor in the time spent, the variety, the difficult, and the release cadence. 2) LW has a enormously disproportionate amount of invested resources when compared to the other parts of content. 
---
While it was never going to happen, this is what the gaming community wanted to hear. "Hello everyone, we've recognized that PoF and LS4 were mainly focused on living world story content and open world gameplay features. Therefore, for the next saga, we will attempt to even the distribution when compared to our other game modes. This will result in 2 out of our 4 content teams being repurposed to work on raids, fractals, pvp, wvw, legendaries, elite specs, balance, new features entirely, etc. This means roughly a 1000% increase in the resource budget of those teams." And then go into the details of each area...This is what people were looking for, but it was never going to happen.
---
I think they're layering a more feminine voice (though definitely in the androgynous range) on top of a dark, whispery classic-dragon voice underneath. During certain moments, you can hear the voices kind of merge and sound more corrupted together. It's honestly a really unique approach.
---
&gt; but as long as support and development continue for a game 
---
That's the whole point. This game made the (good or bad) decision to split their playerbase. PvP and WvW players have received 0 content for more than 2 years now. Those game modes are bleeding player because there is nothing to keep them engaged. In turn more people leave because they have no one to play with. Those game modes aren't supported by Anet right now.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt;the devs have still given us plenty of fresh material and innovation, like the mount system
---
I understand if people in this game like to run around and tag events. For them this announcement was all they wanted. But you can't say "us". There is not one demographic that plays this game. 
---
As someone who raids, fractals, plays pvp and WvW it's hard for me to optimistic. My raid static just quit because they see no reason to play. The delay between raid wings has only increased. 
---
Fractals haven't gotten challenge motes since Nightmare in 2016.
---
The PvP queues are getting longer and longer. You always see the same people in your games since the player base is now so small.
---
WvW has been ignored for more than 2 years now. The new alliance system was being talked about 3 years ago now. They can't keep saying "we'll talk more about it in a few months" forever.
---
So you may be grateful that you get a new story episode every 4 months. But for those of us who do endgame, this announcement was nothing short of a huge disappointment.
---
Exactly, it's literally the only thing they needed to do to calm the waters for a few months. Show some elite specializations, or show concept art or give some hints if they weren't ready yet.
---
Instead we got some vistas. This is a game, not a fucking art gallery. Get your priorities right, god damn it.
---
*Buys up all Frostfang from the TP the day before*
---
STONKS
---
(Just kidding, I'm fucking broke atm)
---
The announcement itself was fine but a lot of people want more content rather than LS. I for one would be okay if they skipped LS every other patch if it meant we got a lot of good/fun repeatable content.
---
They are. Doesn't stop the community from turning on them at times as well.
---
There's a lot of overlap between gw2 and warframe players. Kinda used to a nice community turning on itself when dissatisfied tbh. Just wish there were less people who want to kick a good game like gw2 when it's down.
---
Honestly I doubt anyone came out to PAX *just* for GW2.
---
Future plans for competitive game modes sound very promising. This should have really went into the announcemet. Can't get wait to have these additons.
---
nice
---
I see this argument a lot and I just dont' get the logic of it. If you are ANet and you are NEVER going to do raids again... why would you develop a system for easier raid-style encounters to get new players more comfortable with the idea of ten-man content? Like, why make a tutorial for something you plan on never making again? Strike missions, to me, are the strongest signal that they're even more dedicated to raids in the future! In fact I'd think that, with strikes in place, they would feel more free to make REALLY brutal raids in the future! Because they know their playerbase has a baseline understanding from strike missions.
---
In addition to this, the new content format means that they could add these strikes to core Tyria maps so new players get a feel for this content as well. Imagine fighting Lupi in Orr again as a Strike mission. With all his shit brought up to 2019 standards!
---
I’m BG since beta, and you’re right. We were open for almost two days and everyone and their brother transferred over. But we didn’t get any new Guilds. 
---
So we have tons of pugs but not many guilds, and a dearth of Commanders.  We’re all hoping that we don’t get a link this time. Honestly, fighting for second is more fun than a sure win every week.
---
they actually announced pretty big palette of big stuff...
---
yet people expect to get big package once in 2 years instead of them releasing it whenever it is ready in small packages 10x more often than expansions are...
---
Yeah, that would make sense. Seems a stupid way to run a business though. Expansion 3 looks even more unlikely due to the lay-offs, which ironically, we're most likely caused by anets bad business model.
---
Plus they mentioned bringing HoT masteries to IBS. This neatly solves the issue there, letting everyone be able to learn the masteries and use then even if they previously skipped HoT
---
Warframe just got another tiny content update, with a big game changing expansion just around the corner, FF14 has one of the best expansions ever made. (yes it's a drag to get there) but it has so much content that you'll drown in it, wow classic is actual hype, even if people will only play it for a few months, thats slill hundreds of hours, monster hunter expansion soon, borderlands 3 soon, A LOT of indie games that are actually good are getting released, also torchlight mmo!
---
Internal problems of a company are not the customers' problem. A team only deserves kudos for meeting the customers' expectations... not for surviving the company's internal bullshit.
---
They needed an event to hide the ads of the stuff they were trying to sell everyone like the dark horse comics and the merch. "Buy this stuff, I'm pretty sure this stuff was YOUR idea, IT WAS, WASN'T IT. GIVE US MONEY." I mean, wow how did anyone not notice.
---
This is exactly how I feel. I would enjoy collections/quests if they actually had good gameplay/systems/story attached to them like an actual RPG.
---
I feel like I'd be the fitest and most handsome tosser in that hall. And I'm usually not an egoistic prick.
---
Current bag level is 24-30, fyi.
---
&gt;insanely high sub fee
---
Where the fuck do you live that 15$ is "insanely high"?
---
I mean, I dont like sub fees either, but your statement here is a bit silly.
---
&gt;lists all of the awesome content they announced
---
&gt;i CaN't BeLiEvE i LeT mYsElF gEt ExCiTeD fOr ThIs
---
It doesn't take 'everything'.  It takes noticing that most mobs overlap and you'll approach them the same way.  Once you realize that the enemies use copy-paste moves, the game becomes *incredibly* repetitive.  PoF was a breath of fresh air because hydras completely shifted the way you engage open-world content, and made everything feel fresher and more engaging.  I wish there was more of that!  I wish centaurs trampled you and enemy charr used formations.  That once you get far enough north, Norn would attack you out of nowhere and that Asura could teleport in reinforcements.  I wish the undead inflicted disease and an attack from one increased your detection range to other undead near you, so they'd home in on you en masse instead of stacking slow effects.  I wish some Mordrem could terraform the world under their feet as a semi-persistent effect (like 2 minutes) to give them advantages in combat.  Hell, I wish enemies could use fortifications correctly, that the game had a height advantage system for ranged combat, and that Largos and Norn could take hits out on you as a bounty system.  
---
It would be *really cool* if there was some mechanical diversity to the game but generally speaking, outside of raids it just isn't there.  We fight the class reskins, the wurms, the generic smashy "beasts", and fliers.  Ocassionally Anet steps out of the box and we get pocket raptors, mordrem snipers, and hydras.  And yeah, they're annoying but at least it's *different*.     
---
It's just a shame because the combat's fantastic and I really wish they'd expand on that instead of building up another elder dragon.
---
Exactly, it's not like what they showed was bad. No not at all, what they showed was cool and interesting, but... that was it. Nothing else. They a few interesting things, then we got a sith lord trying to sell IRL minis
---
Yes
---
&gt;Go to their subreddit's and I'm sure you'd find the exact same attitude towards those games.
---
I didn't know that FFXIV had become a cesspit of toxicity and vitriol to match GW2s. Guess I should go dig deeper past the cute cat girl art.
---
Fair point. I haven't been around long enough to know of the other living world announcements, but a studio announcement seems overkill for that. Especially since, as you mention there was little given.
---
WvW, PvP, raids, fractals? Where was stuff taht we didn't already know was coming?
---
The Core game wasn't designed around mounts. You need to utilize your skills and the Swiftness Boon.
---
Warrior would use the Warnhorn 4, Greatsword 3, Bulls' Charge, and Balanced Stance.
---
Elementalist would use Lightning Flash and various Air skills.
---
"potential" means we might see one thing from either list by 2020 if we buy enough gemstore content to please management / advertising. The post-HoT behavior of management in this game in EVERY SINGLE situation other than the firing of JP and the handling of the layoffs has been absolutely disgusting and sickening to my core. Its time to give the amazing devs some people who can actually fucking manage the incredible potential of this game, because this aint it
---
&gt; Why are game companies allowed to get away with shit that no other industry is given slack with?
---
Because we let them, that's why. Fanboys and shills make sure to apply group pressure as well, so the others fall in line. This stupid trend has led gaming to the garbage can during the last decade.
---
I don't have some of these, as I was away for almost a year because of chemo and thus missed a bunch of HoT skin releases, which these are. So for me, the laurels will be nice.
---
But we do know what they are going to do, and that's the problem. Here's what's coming: Living Story, Alliances (some day), SWISS (some day), mini seasons, special seasons, Build Templates. That's it. Nothing crazy, no big xpac in development, none of those features on the bingo card you're referring to. The reason they didn't bring any of that stuff up, is because it's not even on the table. 
---
The only thing I would expect to hear more about later on are raids, fractals, and more info on the release structure for living story.
---
I bought PoF in Dezember for money from a christmas present.
---
I bought HoT in February for money from a birthday present.
---
I bought LS4 because I wanted the Rollerbeetle 5 days before Arenanet announced that all episodes of LS4 will be available for free again during the "Welcome Back" event in late March and PoF went 50% off at that time.
---
So... I didn't have much luck concerning money.
---
Considering, that, would I have bought PoF in late March I would have paid about 15€ instead of 70€ and would have gotten everything by now anyway.
---
But during that time, I defeated Balthazar, Mordremoth and Kralkatorik together with my girlfriend, got a glider, learned to ride raptors and roller beetles, became a Holosmith and a Scrapper, conquered the Windswept Haven with my real-live friends and flew my very own skyscale just yesterday.
---
All of that was worth the 70€ to me.
---
If I hadn't bought it, I would have lost interest halve a year ago.
---
But anyway, I won't buy LS3 right now, although I would love to see it, because if I will, it will be 80% off and bundled with LS2 a week after...
---
I'm just surprised we have anything after they shed so many people due to lack of support.
---
If you let down your core community, nobody is going to start playing. I said it before in another thread, people who saw or heard about the announcement and came to reddit have probably decided not to try guild wars 2. You don’t make an announcement, say its FOR  THE COMMUNITY,  then ignore 100% of the community during the announcement, and then finally, remind us that they couldn’t do it WITHOUT US.
---
Well I guess Thief is already perfectly balanced then
---
15$ a month for a broke student who can barely afford food, who, as I said in my previous comment that was clearly ignored, cannot (and often just doesn't want to) play a game consistently enough in any given month to justify a 15$ commitment, but still wants to play that game, and who has viable alternatives that don't break the bank.
---
15$ a month is 180$ a year. I'm Canadian, so it's really 240$ a year. That may be disposable income to someone who plays the game every day out of that year and who isn't a broke student with thousands of student loans and wants to not be stuck paying them back for a decade, but for me, it's far too expensive.
---
If everyone spent $40-$50 on expansions, we'd have so much in game stuff
---
This is one of the reasons I stopped playing GW2 as much and spend most of my time in Warframe.
---
too bad that game got such a bad wrap. Yes, it wasn't the well written marvel that was ME2, but it was still a fun ME game. I actually enjoyed the gameplay more in that one than the others. Still, ME2 is my favorite, but too bad for andromeda.
---
Tera and ESO? You gotta be kidding me.
---
BDO is the only one that is comparable one and the one that a lot of GW2 jumped ship to as soon as it was released. The only problem is it's a very shallow "mmo." You're just straight up lying by saying the combat is no different than "a lot" of mmos out there. 
---
&gt;has a higher skill ceiling due to animation cancelling
---
You know GW2 has this too, right? ESO is decent, but it still has that strong, ugly "bathesda game" feel to it. It just doesn't compare, at all to how smooth and action-based GW2 is.
---
Only buy from official retailers [listed on this site](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#UnitedStates-physical) or the copy you buy might be fraudulent, leading to your account being banned.
---
Don't worry about what country you pick, the code will work anywhere (except China, which is its own bubble).
---
Basically just we want more than one raid a year and Alliance system has taken way too long to a game mode that was struggling even worse than raids. So unless all you care about is open world over and a story format that has recently prevented you from dying in any of the instances then you are out of luck. Not only were raids overlooked but now they have added a new system strike missions that are way easier and will cut development time from raids to even longer if at all. Any part of this game that requires a slight bit of skill is being removed. That’s why people are mad. There is zero prestige and no repeatable content that makes you want to log in daily.
---
The feels.
---
I know, I already left quite long ago because lack of content outside story packs. With this announcement I hoped that there was going to be more, especially since ANet only focus on GW2 after the layoffs. Future does not look bright, and this seems to be a nail in the coffin.
---
What core community? The core raiding community? The core WvW community. The core PvP community? The core casual community?
---
The community wasn't let down. Different elements within a larger community were let down.  This has nothing to do with no one starting playing, because not everyone will come to reddit or the forums. They'll be at the show, buy the game and not even know that any of this is going on. 
---
I've talked to people in my guild, and so far none of them are let down. But it's a casual guild t hat doesn't raid and barely does PvP.
---
I like the fact that 'to snow' means to deceive someone, and that this definitely sums up Jormag.
---
I'm really curious to see what's going on behind the scenes.  This gives a strong impression of mishandling, but we might get a better perspective on the business side of things when the quarterly reports roll out.
---
Broham face is priceless. Well done.
---
Hence why you're reading this in the GW2 subreddit and not a complaint thread about WoW
---
I did too. As a WvW player I would have liked more, but I didn't expect that from THIS announcement.
---
nah,i just dont understand what these gaming companies doing with their time/ppl. its getting embarasing how LITTLE  250 ppl can do in a year. or in case of BIOWARE how little can  500 ppl do in 5 years.
---
I think they will. Keep in mind they had to deal with massive cuts earlier this year and are probably still working on reorganization. Maybe after today they’ll realize the value of transparency and realism in communication with the fan base.
---
That's generalising. Anet has thousands upon thousands upon thousands of customers, and it just takes a handful of them to start a drama. 
---
I, for one, am rather satisfied with the announcement, because the biggest question for me was the actual future of the game, whether we keep rolling or if we should all start to say goodbye to each other and the game.
---
It got answered, we got ourselves a tangible release date for the next patch, confirmation of build templates coming soon with footage of it in action (albeit with hidden UI), they set the tone for this upcoming 'saga', *and* declared HoT bundled together with PoF, making the entry price (excluding old LW seasons) about 30 bucks.
---
This is quite a good time to have done that, because Classic WoW has launched, and many people will likely find themselves unable to cope with the rythm of that game. Be it the queues, be it the grinding, be it the lack of teaming up because everyone has a busy agenda, some will start to look around for alternative mmos and guess what: This one just got a permanent discount!
---
But hey, they didn't mention elite specs so despite all that, their marketing still sucks. /s
---
The thing is simple, you don't like MMOs. Cuz they're practically all the same.
---
1st, I think that idea doesn't properly characterize the other. They could still get fulfillment out of the massive amount of stuff in the game right now while looking at a bleak future for the game.
---
2nd, a lot of these people *don't* play the game currently. They are following it and hoping that it will reach the potential they hope for it, to get the motivation to play it again.
---
I kinda feel that about this, too.
---
&gt;New LS
---
We knew that was coming. The trailer was well done and it does look interesting at least
---
&gt;Build Templates
---
We had this with Arc for so long now, that I dont even consider this much of  a feature worth making a fuss about. I guess it'll be a thing for people who are adamant about not using 3rd party tools???
---
&gt;Strike-Missions
---
How exactly does it tie into raiding? This could just be 10 man instanced bounties (but slightly harder), but more instanced content =/= Raid accessibility. People might do this for the rewards/achievements and then leave it be unless they're bored/helping a buddy.
---
&gt;Swiss/World restructure 
---
Announced months ago. Not a new thing to bring up and its still in a "Soon(tm)" phsae
---
&gt;New World Boss
---
Another loot pinata probably.
---
&gt;Merchandising
---
Not really interesting.
---
It feels really weird to have a somewhat big event for all of this when there's barely any meat to what was provided.
---
LUL
---
I operate on simple algorithm. 
---
- Is it new?
---
- Does it bring changes to core WvW gameplay?
---
- Do I want to play it?
---
Warclaw changed literally nothing aside big advantage mobility for 1 bigger squad over several squads in several borders and sudden death for ganking. Ultimately making even my zerg experience worse since it not even mixed with occasional solo kill of ganker.
---
Sry but weapons are really really lacking, and since I hit 2k+ this year I have no real goals to achieve in WvW aside core gameplay. Witch is was at bad spot in May even on Gandara.
---
And healer scrapper... sry but if you can play this more braindead than Scourge build more than 6 hours you are my champion. I have full minstrel Scrapper, played it on two resets, never more.
---
&gt;If you have nothing to hype about the game don't do a massive announcement. It is plain and simple.
---
This coming from the same community that bitches and whines just as hard when Anet releases episodes without any hype.
---
I suggested having a conversation about finding a solution and the first word in your response was "No" which told me you didn't want to have a conversation and that you would rather whine more. Also from what you're saying it seems more like you are mad because they aren't adding elite specs ( which we need more balancing of the elites we have now before adding more) or an xpac ( which they said six months ago isn't happening but I guess you missed that). Then you went on to use a Venn diagram to show me how there is a tiny area that they need to hit to get it right. It sounded like to me that you just want to whine instead of having a discussion.
---
Can't remember myself how they revealed the other's off the top of my head but the last time I remember them renting a live venue for an announcement was when they revealed Heart of Thorns which was a major thing at the time.  
---
Revealing details of a LW chapter in the same context did lead a lot of us to assume it was going to be paired with more than merch and news about the expansions being bundled together.
---
"... next to nothing ..."
---
Seriously? WTF. Maybe that wasn't the content you wanted. Maybe PvE isn't your thing. But they promised a LS5 release announcement and that's what we got. Furthermore, we're getting build templates and I forget what all else. I'm sorry it wasn't the game being converted to all raid content or whatever you wanted, dude, but that was NOT "next to nothing."
---
They didn't just say they delayed it. They said they outright started from scratch again because they were so unhappy with the way their product was going.
---
Thing is, Nintendo has the budget to just say "okay screw all of this, let's start over"
---
Let's not pretend that games that intend to retain a playerbase could possibly launch a big package every two years and survive.
---
&gt;Oh yes and the general philosophy that you shouldn't have to grind for incremental stats and that you should play the content that lets you reach your goals, not just the best gold farm ,etc.
---
Ok, for starts, the whole "not having grind" works heavily against it. Before Ascended, if you played the game at launch and had an Exotic set, you didn't need absolutely anything at all, any piece of gear you gained afterwards was literal garbage. Same now with Ascended, once you have it, you don't need anything, you don't have gear to grind towards, which makes all the grind......worthless.
---
And no, it did not revolutionized MMOs because of it, since no other MMO does the heart system and events you can find and do have been done before GW2 and done better \[I.E the Rifts, which even become stronger and take more space if you do not stop them in time\]
---
What do u mean free? We paid 50€ for each versions of the game (3). Some of us even bought the Heroic editions.
---
They abandoned expansion content because they cant create it and people would not buy it anymore.
---
Once they step up, people will reconsider.
---
I totally understand where he's coming from here, and i sympathize, truly. But Hyping up the community for the better part of a MONTH, for what we received today? nah.
---
I can't help you avoid trolls, but if you click on the chest, it'll prioritize opening the chest over using boxes/portals
---
12,000 hours in gw1, and it still feels like new stuff to do every time I play. 
---
3,500 hours in gw2, and I have 4 legendaries, a maxed of every class with both specs, and all masteries. Everything feels like a grind and I dont play anymore.
---
Those words brought down a Prime Minster once... (and yes, I know who she is)
---
I hope no one booked tickets to fly out there.
---
And yet, they've made 7 warclaw skins...
---
Shh..You're going to ruin the circlejerk that is this community.
---
I wonder when Anet will be ready to talk about this game mode dying.
---
I've done plenty of hard things in the game, what would doing one more prove that the other's haven't?
---
The community, myself included, had unrealistic expectations about today.   And now that those great expectations were not meant, everyone is losing their mind without realizing the issue today has more to do with UE than with what ANET did.  
---
Everyone has been asking for more communication from ANET for years.  And now that they have done so, here is a post calling for someone to get fired.
---
Yeah, I had kinda hoped we were done with dragons at this point.
---
Im not even playing (currently on a 5th month of break and will be for another year) and i still disappointed when i open my email about the Saga. I mean, its a huge announcement and i at least expect something good. But its just another new Season that can be announced as the previous new episodes on the website instead of... these. Not to mention its just a trailer and doesnt look good either.
---
Because you bitching all the time about isn't "negative bullshit". I looked at your comment history and you bring your negative bullshit everywhere.
---
It's what Anet told people to expect with season 5, what do you expect?
---
I feel like somebody should tell Anet that communication is the key to a healthy relationship.
---
I agree. I don’t think anyone had any delusions about how badly today shook the confidence of the community. But it’s not the end of the world and having people engaging in hyperbole rather than reasoned discussion hurts us all, individually and as a community. We need to be firm in our response to ANet, not frantic.
---
My guild disbanded last night at the announcement.
---
I don't know about the majority, but I think that losing all the hardcore minorities is as much a problem as anything. Man the raid scene is deadly quiet, pvp is basically only bots and wvw is already a goner. 
---
People won't even stick around for the story, its linear, bland and shallow. IDK man, I'm just going where my friends are to ffxiv.
---
Anet never had to release any content to keep us, nobody actually wants to leave, but its like a sinking ship. If they literally just got up and said: 
---
"Hey guys we want to apologise to all of the veterans in our game. We havent been kind to you, while we do appreciate new customers, we also recognise the value of our key customer advocates. We don't have anything concrete we can announce to you today, we're working really hard on it, because we don't want to lose you. Expect something soon, we wont ignore you anymore."
---
It would have been enough to prevent at least a few thousand people from leaving the game.
---
The whole season 5 announcement is on their twitch, including the Rytlock clip
---
I like you.
---
I'm looking forward to a Jason mini in game now
---
I log in after I complete the story. I also play in the zones. I keep seeing the phrase 2 hours of content every four months. I see it over and over again. It's a hard core mantra. It's also very misleading. It's like people didn't farm the metas in 3 of the 6 Living World zones for weeks after they came out. It's like doing the same raid over and over again is content, but doing the zones and metas aren't.  It's a double standard.
---
I'll go out on a limb here and suggest more people run metas  that raid.
---
  
---
I get there is a hard core community and I know what they want. But they're called the top 5% for a reason. You guys, you're in the top 5%. You're better at the game. You want harder content. I get it. You want stuff that is made for you. I get it.
---
But I think most players are still trying to figure out what a break bar is. lol
---
PvE is all I play. we already knew LS5 was coming. Anything on top of that should’ve just been a lore blog post. Build templates? LOL. that was already announced and we got no new info on it.
---
Honestly it was a harmless joke, and made because one person in the room cheered. If anything that's not on him, that's on the lack of players' support
---
I once had a public discussion on Reddit with the then newly appointed head of global marketing for the game. 
---
I made the point - as many people have done - that lack of communication really hurts the player-dev relationship, and ultimately turns that relationship into an "us and them." I pointed to an example of a game that, at the time, I fucking loved and played the shit out of: Stellaris. The Stellaris devs have weekly "Dev Diaries" where they get to explain in broad brush strokes what is going on behind the scenes. Sometimes those diaries are brief and along the lines of "we know shit's broken post-patch, we're fixing it, and doing balance passes on things." 
---
Sometimes they are longer and much more detailed about upcoming content releases. 
---
Sometimes they are more vague with a wish list of things they would like to put in the game over some longer period of time. (I hesitate to call those a road map, but they do come close to it sometimes.) 
---
Overall, the Dev Diaries are not enormous,  but they keep the community engaged and up to speed on the thought processes of the devs. It allows the community to ask questions and get succinct but thorough answers in reply.  It always makes it abundantly clear that the game is receiving constant development time and hasn't been abandoned. 
---
This type of Dev Diary is used for other Paradox titles, such as Hearts of Iron. 
---
When I pointed this out to the new head of global marketing, he thanked me for the suggestion, and said that something similar was already in the works. 
---
Great! I thought. Until he mentioned the similar thing was the Forum Chats. 
---
Remember those? The last one was in January. And they are not even close to the Paradox Dev Diaries. Overall they are a flop and not what the community needed. 
---
I realise that Paradox games are not MMOs, and that GW2 is not similar to any Paradox game. But the basic Dev Disry idea is transferable. Two of the things the Dev Diaries accomplish are: managing player expectations; and providing a sort of road map for their games. Both if which ANet are spectacularly bad at doing.
---
I genuinely don't know why Mike Z can't knock up a brief weekly or fortnightly Dev Diary and answer a few questions from the community.
---
Its one of the reasons I got sick of the gw2 community being so up its own ass about being such a friendly and positive community
---
What that really means is that any opinion that is not perceived as friendly or positive it has to pass a higher level of judgement than anything that's gushing about how amazing the game is.
---
'Tough love' was *HIGHLY* criticized for the first few years of the game, and it seems that the playerbase is only becoming more open to critical viewpoints as the flaws of the game have continued to persist.
---
After switching from gw2 to old school runescape I noticed an astounding difference in community attitude. Nearly every update in the osrs community is looked at under a much more critical view, and it is **NOT** seen as a bad thing.
---
Constructive criticism being stifled by positivity is not healthy for a community, and I think the more we have players doing damage control for Anet who refuse to comment on most controversies, the more those who have complaints will feel like they don't have a voice and start looking for another game.
---
Here's the thing, I'm not mad. I bought the game and have fun playing it the friends I have made in the game. I posted this to give people a place to have a discussion and come up with something organized to show ANet instead of just whinging about they are silent and then when they aren't whinging about how they didn't communicate correctly. I have only seen a bunch of noise over 7 years and nothing organized.
---
I feel as if they just wanted to make sure people knew prolouge was free.
---
&gt; This baby raid concept seems to be 
---
We don't know enough about the Strike Missions now to draw definitive conclusions.   
---
Also calling them baby raids is asking for negative feedback from Raiders, like the Republicans did with Universal Healthcare with their Obamacare label, despite the fact Romney (R) passed very similar healthcare legislation in Massachusetts.  What the community should be demanding is ACTUAL RAID CONTENT and let Strike Missions be their own thing without the responsibility of having to replace raids in the minds of raiders.
---
You missed an L there
---
40 is "increasingly unemployable and retirement is not too far away either"?  You're funny. Stay in school!
---
That is exactly what they meant by best combat system that's not being utilized properly.
---
You have any idea how many people have told me, "You have to suffer through the incredibly terrible early game to get to the good stuff at the end." ?
---
No, I don't. Because I don't play shit games. Especially not ones that require me to buy them AND pay again every month regardless of whether they add anything meaningful or not.
---
But, are you telling me that they remove the GCD at high levels?
---
&gt;Because ANet didn't post that and it sounds impossible you just quit? 
---
Likely because people have tried for literal years and ANet has refused to listen.
---
Maybe the reaction of the community to communication (and every other thing it seems) is the reason why there isn't more. More frequent, better quality etc. 
---
Maybe ANet are smart enough to know that it doesn't matter *what* they announce Reddit will go up like a tinderbox because there will always be a certain section of the community not happy with whatever it is.
---
Maybe they don't talk about future *plans* because when MMO communities hear the words "we are looking at" they *hear* "we promise, this is set in stone" and forever after have a shit fit because it isn't here. NOW.
---
If I was ANet, or any other developer for that matter I would be terrified of saying anything....
---
the problem in all this is just Anet clearly caters towards players that are satisfied with collections. So suggesting the game is not for those is kind of ridicilous since its clearly amde for them.
---
Sure, but what's the purpose of the page, I'm a graphic designer, rule 1 is that everything has a purpose, every line, every color.
---
This page is just a secondary advertising page for their 2 for 1 deal. If they wanted people to get excited for "The Icebrood Saga" list new features or systems, show what you'll gain for playing.
---
It's Advertising 101; right now all their hyping is something that's nice for people on the fence between HoT or PoF. For the rest of us already in, it's completely useless.
---
Well, at least there's precedent.
---
Yeah I'm already over this pity party. The world's not ending
---
You’re literally defending anet for feeding rabbit meat to a starving child. 
---
Sure its food, but its not sustenance. 
---
Think about that for a second.
---
Even a trashy, unfinished expac? I don't understand you, my dude
---
How is rushed garbage that costs you money better than a regular trickle of free content that the devs actually have proper time to work on? You like throwing your money right out the window?
---
Its just a video game dude.
---
frankly they should be ashamed that a 15 year old game without the benefit of 15 years of improvements is more fun, better supported and has more players than their 7 year old game with all of the QoL additions from those 7 years.
---
If there were only let's say an overhyped event where you can show people that change is coming?
---
Not at all. If you saw someone who was very unhappy in a relationship who insisted they still loved the person but it was clearly making them miserable, wouldn’t you advise them to leave for their own well being? Of course it’s still their choice, but they in turn can’t change their partner. It’s not an easy choice by any means, but one that nevertheless must be made. 
---
If the person leaves, do they necessarily stop caring for their well being? No. But they distance themselves for their own emotional health. It’s not a black and white dichotomy, or at least it doesn’t have to be.
---
I think you are mistaken about WvW - in contrast to PvE you need some dynamics for it to be fun: attacks, counter-attacks, diversions, scouting, last-minute rescues.... this is only fun if you can participate and it's an up and down for everyone. This healthy balance has not been in place for four years and the WvW updates have only put band-aid on the problems but not solved them. This is not about the gamemode being extended, this is waiting for the mode to become playable again - tbh I'm actually past that point, it's more fun to run around the guild hall while talking to people for me than WvW (roaming).
---
45 mins, lovely. The announcement itself was actually 35mins, not the full 45.
---
I don't have a lot of these, but I'm also a Fashion Wars scrub and I mostly use outfits. Which can't be used with custom helms, right?
---
DIdn't realize you were sarcastic at first, I feel stupid now.
---
I'm guessing there's gonna be one more raid in LWS5. 4 raids in HoT and 4 raids in PoF. Then who knows. Probably nothing as it's clear they don't have any long term plans.
---
You clearly didn't read the GW2 novels.
---
If you're not a raider, a hard core PvPer or a hard core WvWer, you made a mistake uninstalling. I don't believe that the hard core population represents the bulk of the population, though they most assuredly represent the bulk of the posts.
---
Maybe he is referring to this.  [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/85879/future-plans-competitive/](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/85879/future-plans-competitive/)  and  [https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/85188/potential-future-balance-changes](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/85188/potential-future-balance-changes) .
---
Might as well spread the word the same way people spread their discomtempt because atleast they are trying and this counts as communication.
---
I don’t disagree, but failure now doesn’t mean that redemption can’t happen later.
---
Just like WoW? Oh wait...
---
A new class with a main hand shield (and a off hand shield) would be awesome!
---
Not sure if Engineer would be the best class for it (other then the holo idea)
---
"Everything changed on February 25th.." yeah no, GW2 was already run by a skeleton crew well before that, and we players could feel the neglect. It just took a while for the majority to catch up and open their eyes.
---
I'm terribly sorry for the laid off people, while I have no sympathy whatsoever for Anet as a faceless, impersonal, distant company that it's become lately. The layoffs are a direct consequence of GW2 being neglected in favor of the now-cancelled projects. The management literally chose this miserable fate when they pulled people off from GW2, their main and still, potentially, strongly supported title. How do we keep supporting something that was planned to be abandoned and now forcibly picked back up? I couldn't help but still feel betrayed, so I may react more harsh than I'd normally do. I want my faith back, I waited for today with hope and Anet delivered an empty plate - what did we need so much hype for, again? I want to feel confident in the game's future, literally the only thing I needed to hear today is "an expansion is planned", no matter if it's 2021 or later. So far we only know that we can come back every 3-4 months for a few hours of content. Will this keep players? Will this bring money? What about the word of mouth, content creators, competitive scene that feels unwelcome in this game anymore? I had a post with these exact same concerns early this year and it got downvoted to hell. Sucks to realize that we're now in this shitty future. Let's try to not have any expectations or wishes for the game to prosper and enjoy more of the same LW and gemstore updates I guess.
---
We need a tutorial, not a 'tutorial-tier' content.   
---
People don't know the basics. They don't know their traits. They don't know how to build their gear and what their rotations are. It won't be fixed by baby raids or whatever, because in this community, when you encounter something challenging you don't learn from it, you cry it's too hard and anet needs to nerf it because you're working 3 jobs and have only one hour a week to play.
---
Almost level 500 cooking woot!
---
A roadmap can be as vague as 'sooner', 'later', 'far future' with things being shifted as needed. 
---
This isn't a 'game industry' thing it's a business model for expansion. Investors and stakeholders like to know where priorities lie even if it's not pinned down to an exact day of an exact year, it's a good faith to show where their money is going when. Try getting a loan from a bank or private investor for a small business without some form of roadmap and see how far you get. 
---
The problem is either they can't stick to a game plan long enough to have a roadmap or they don't consider the players stakeholders. If they don't consider the players stakeholders then players won't consider them when it comes time to buy or renew. But, based on ArenaNet's history it's more likely they just don't have a game plan they can stick to (see: dropping support for game modes left and right and constantly changing the living world/xpac formula). Neither of those options instills a ton of faith in the players which is why the community is getting fed up.
---
The roadmap is a show of good faith in a time when faith is needed. It doesn't need to be specific or even accurate, just a fair assessment of their priorities so players don't feel like they'll waste their time on a game-as-a-service that won't have a service left to offer in a year.
---
Experiences differ greatly between NA and EU servers.  NA servers have lost so much population in 2019.
---
I left before the first expansion came out. Came back when it HoT came out and played a little then quit. Then came back for PoF, played with mounts a bit then quit. I've been logging in to get the episodes of LS but other than that I don't really play. There just isn't anything drawing me in like GW1 had.
---
are you gaslighting? They, corporate arenanet, repeatedly advertised a 45 minute long, living world centric presentation. instead, living world was squished in between two sets of advertisements. Corporate put a strangle on today's presentation. I feel bad for the devs, but something needs to change after what i just witnessed on that stream. The devs need better leadership than this, but I have a feeling that this late into the game, corporate will just gaslight us too, accuse us of exclusively hating on the devs who pour their hearts and souls into this game in ways that i can FEEL, and then continue bringing the game down with their corporate blind greed. if this is a business, it is a poorly run one that needs a serious management shake up. it doesnt matter if you have the best car parts in the entire world (the devs) if the driver is blind (corporate)
---
I, too, enjoy going to the grocery store and buying everything on my list.
---
they aren't really devs if they just write bad stories. that just makes them poor writers
---
I wish I had that kind of power.
---
Roadmaps are double edge swords, and is quite pointless if Devs run into quagmire and are not able to meet their objective in time. And roadmaps change all the time, rendering the concept moot. 
---
Just go take a look at the Star citizen roadmap threads, what do you see? Ppl lambasting CiG for slow development (though CiG fully deserves that).
---
Trailer would not get players on WvW tag with resist on call.
---
It is nice cinematic piece tho. Would watch lets play with glass of wine. No need to install to press F+1 in PvE.
---
And yeah I uninstalled in May after completing Aurora 2.0 and Gateskale. Around the time when Aeric "quit".
---
I'm pretty sure the guy is trolling. At this point. Look down at his talk with me.
---
That's what Jagex does with Oldschool Runescape and it works pretty well. Towards they end of every year they have RuneFest and announce a bunch of big stuff they hope to bring into the game within the next year. No hard dates, no promises, it's just what they want to do and what people can look forward to. The updates might come out in January or August or even December. They post updates on what they had shown off throughout the year and the closer it gets to being finished the more information they reveal on it and eventually give release dates. It just feels like that level of communication should be standard.
---
Well OP’S has wvw in it so.....
---
its literally an inverted progression curve. That is text book horrible game design dude.
---
Dude, I used to work moding for old Ultima Online emulator servers and you just perfectly summed up why I never wanted to talk to players. They act like you owe them the world. If you can't deliver exactly when and what they want they act like you broke some sacred vow. I can understand why ANet was silent.
---
he can just go in exotics nbd
---
They're going to be glorified bounties.
---
I took that to mean that the season 5 prologue will be free even if you don't log in while season 5 is active.
---
You, and everyone else, did this to yourself.
---
Don’t blame ANet. They put a clock on a screen and everyone lost thier minds.
---
Now you are angry at them because your fantasies didn’t happen.
---
Its just a video game dudes and dudettes. Its not the end of the world. You shouldn’t tie so much of your emotions in a game.
---
i uninstalled for classic wow and then i realised that i didnt need to because it was only 4 gbs but i honestly just cbf reinstalling, hadn't played in a month anyway
---
Matthew should remember that Arenanet is a business and their primary responsibility is to convince us to give them money. Our relationship is that of corporation and customer, we do not owe anyone our bespoke loyalty and we have every right to be disappointed if we feel that way.
---
I sympathize with developers both current and former for the layoffs they faced, but it's not really on the customer to understand how that affects development. In fact, this whole industry does all it can to hide that kind of information from us.
---
That all said, I'm not even that disappointed. I'm confused why they chose to do this the way they did, but the content itself sounds OK to me. I've been waiting for Norn/Far Shiverpeaks content for 7 years.
---
Then don't make an overhyped special announcement. Just do a normal stream and blog post
---
For now. Once we finally trick Congress into banning lootboxes to save our children I think they're going to become a lot less profitable.
---
100% they knew, were expecting it and won't do much about it.
---
If you're going to call out another announcement, at least use Blizzcon's Diablo Immortal reveal.
---
I feel the same except I've been waiting for Cantha which I doubt will ever happen due to some stupid reason.
---
People want this game to be something else than what it is.
---
It isn’t. 
---
And now they are angry about it. WTF??
---
Oh yeah. I didn't see that. I'm a dork. lol
---
I've been sick to death of dragons as a fantasy trope for a decade or more. They're just painfully over-used.
---
I don’t expect anything. I just wait for actual results. Things will happen when they happen, and in the mean time I just stay patient and enjoy what we already have. I think people focus too much on the future and not enough on the wealth of content we’ve already accumulated. Core Tyria alone has tons, and that’s 100% free.
---
?
---
at least today there are 5 dudes trough 3  guilds im in who noped the fuck out gw2 after this joke announcement. ill probably gonna stop playing till sep 17, see what they have to offer and if its the same like LW shit we get now ill just quit for good. cant imagine (not saying its dead or anything) where this game will be in 2 years, shit, even a year sounds painful with how they communicate ( they dont). i guess the hope now is that this title change is sth better for the game and not just that, a title change with the same stuff just instead of purple pewpew we get blue pewpew...
---
“If all you enjoy in GW2 is roleplaying as a quaggan in LA then you made a mistake uninstalling”
---
theres some sinister about him... maybe cause he works for ncsoft.. cant put my finger on it.
---
Well, PAX is also this weekend.
---
Content that isn't mindlessly pressing f and auto attacking with compelling RPG, social and game systems.
---
Actually, meaningful content varies greatly from player to player. I'm almost guaranteeing meaningful content to you would be wasted content on me. That's sort of my point.
---
Nope... Mobile apps still pay better because programming apps pays better than games, period.
---
Ooh, fancy. I actually didn't know that.
---
Also, thanks much for everything you've done for the community! I almost certainly would've stopped raiding long ago without your tools.
---
[removed]
---
Their are plenty of people on here that ARE actively rooting against the game.
---
Just read the posts.
---
Not salty, just a realist.
---
I'm more amused than anything at how horrifically bad ANet handled this.
---
I haven't touched the game since PoF released either.
---
Game has been dying since 2019 started.
---
I understand the frustration, I remember that giant gap of nothing for WvW so long ago (before the Desert maps were originally added) while we waited endlessly for new stuff. But acting like the game is dead because you're not being catered to is completely asinine and makes the community look bad. I had a friend look at all these topics after he watched the stream with me (he's never played the game but came in as the stream was starting), and his basic statement was "These guys are about as toxic as the WoW community." 
---
We don't need that stigma, we don't need the constant downvoting because people don't agree with you, we don't need people doomsaying every time they don't get what they want. It's stressful, it's toxic, and it can make people actually not want anything to do with the game. It only hurts the game when we're like this.
---
Constructive criticism is one thing, and the complaint of all that event space just for this reveal is a bit warranted (because really, it did overhype things more than it needed to). But again, acting like just because the mode you play has gotten nothing mentioned means the game is dead or Anet doesn't care doesn't help things.
---
I can understand why he would create one. You would understand too if you'd ever have to deal with crippling depression.
---
Yea, not only do they need to draw in more players, the active community, whether they play or not, shit on the game quite a lot.
---
RIP Bex and her memes, she will be missed.
---
But there was zero information that would speak to people unknown with Gw2..
---
It’s intriguing that they refer to it as a *saga* and not a season. Perhaps Anet are just trying to delay LS5 so they never have to make an expansion
---
I'm just here to piss off the rabid defenders of the game...like you.
---
I'm at work and getting paid for this time.
---
Nice.
---
Its not good marketing to over hype a very bland and information-less event. 
---
At all.
---
The build system, which is the key point when talking about build templates, is completely different in gw2 than gw1. Gw1 had to track 8 skills and 9 attributes ranging from 1 to 12. Gw2 templates need to incorporate your inventory and equipment. The systems are not comparable.
---
Oh yeah... that was today. 
---
Oh well
---
Typical dismissive, hard core answer. It's okay if you don't like story that much and you're not an altoholic and you dont' run metas, and you're not a farmer. That's fine. 
---
If you think I'm approaching 37k AP becasue I'm roleplaying a quaggan in LA, I don't know what to tell you. I'm 11 points away from my 37 k chest at the moment.   I didn't get it from sitting in LA, that much I promise you.
---
Oof
---
The event wasnt even advertised ingame like previous such announcements, i guess they fired the person that was in charge of that last time and forgot.
---
"wait i can actually give you money AND not get new content at the same time ? ?" I'm physically in pain at how true that is :(
---
Wehn they said about Armor skins I thought about armor sets like Zodiac and a bit hyped to get one of them... not lame hats...
---
Gw1 guild halls are nothing compared to gw2. They're clearly making upgraded versions of anything that was in gw1.
---
I can't tell what the point is that you're trying to make
---
Its not about hype, its about overhyping beyond what they are developing. It raises people expectations unreasonably and there is inevitably disappointment when those expectations aren't met.
---
And the disappointment is being expressed in all social media about the game not just reddit.
---
If they have a dog version of those leggings i may be on board.
---
thats harassment :)
---
Some of the cross promotional stuff is really weird, but the Funko Pop and Razer mouse pads seem like they will have quite a few fans amongst us players, so no real need to hate on those two.  
---
And since ANET is a business I am not going to begrudge them trying to create more revenue streams to pay the devs to continue to produce content that I don't have to pay anything more for.   I am not going to buy a single Funko, but I am glad others are to support my gaming habit. 
---
Instead of rallying against ANET's free to play model,   why don't you share with us what new content you would like to see.
---
Unless you're playing literally only story and open world afk there is basically no reason to not uninstall on the spot.
---
New story looks pretty cool tho. Nice trailer and the storyline seems to be more intersting.
---
Whats amazing is that they deliver this disappointment right when they are facing so much competition.
---
Oh, you're actually talking about apps. Sorry, I misunderstood you.
---
me_irl
---
Goddamnit no other game (FOR ME) has come close to the combat, movement, and mount system thats GW2 has. Ive tried ffxiv, wow classic, bit of ESO(horrible experience) and i just cant get over how i miss the gw2 combat and movement. It keeps bringing me back but once i get back im like....what now? This game broke me.
---
This is my problem. I wouldn't really have an issue if they advertised it as, "Living World Season 5 Announcement." In fact, I'd probably be pretty happy with it. But they overhyped the living shit out of this event. Sorry, but build templates isn't an "Expansion Quality Feature." It's more of a, "Feature we should have added more than half a decade ago." 
---
And you hit the nail on the head in that last part. I was optimistic about the future of the game before today, but now I can't help but feel like it's just going downhill from here.
---
Please no. I got so sick of seeing it. I wanted them to allow you to pick from all of them but as far as I know they never did.
---
&gt;3rd party marketing partnerships.
---
Cause that never backfired for them in the past.
---
There are now close to 50 hours of player communications via their own twitch stream, between all the spam cancer, to find out exactly what players are thinking. The countdown stream was surprisingly tame and collected before the spammers came in when it got closer to announcement time.
---
Thanks! I can confirm this is true as i just did it myself!
---
\*distant laughing\*
---
This would be pretty cool mixed with some sort of profession based quest
---
NCSoft Sith Overlord Guy made me cringe so hard, why he was even there.
---
Yeah. I understand.
---
Anet made an amazing franchise. Hoping for the best. This is the only game I play...
---
I'm mostly a raider. It's been bad for a while. Content is too slow.
---
so you're saying starting a stream in twitch, where afaik games are streamed, is great marketing now?
---
What, don't you guys have phon.... oops, wrong disaster.
---
What happened today is 100% on Anet, not the players.
---
Toxic players would complain no matter what Anet would do, that's true. But they are minuscule part of community (just that they yap the loudest so it may seem there's more of them). Most players are quite nice and would definitely understand and appreciate this announcement if it would've been presented the right way.
---
I personally don't care much about WvW and raids, so lack of that content shouldn't bother me much (and it didn't). And all the presented info seemed great (minus merchandise part that took too long IMO). Yet here I am, very disappointed. Why? Because of all the hype that Anet themselves created. They annouced the announcement a month(!) earlier, then more than day before they started stream with countdown ...only to talk about content of the size of *mere* Living World. We had quite few of those and Anet never hyped them like that. Everyone was expecting something grander than this (rightfully so).
---
Those scenes represented the fears of the races pf Tyria. Jormag uses those fears to manipulate and ensnare icebrood. They're not to be taken as scenes of things that will happen in this saga, they're what humans fear most (subjugation by centaur).
---
Is this sarcasm? What "big update every 3 months" are you referring to? Every 3 months, we get an update that is half bug fixes and pointless/ petty nerfing or buffing of specs that hardly makes a difference. The rest of the update is just skins in the gem store and some other Lion Chest crap. I hope you're just kidding...
---
Who is the voice
---
So why the fuck did they hype this thing for a month and even were cocky enough to add a countdown timer on their official stream?
---
I've not played GW1 so I cannot comment on it but I'll say that GW2 has a buttload of content. HOWEVER, the content in GW2 are highly non-repeatable. The philosophy behind GW2 is "play once and never again" which is killing the game tbh. We need more content that have replay value!!!
---
Id actually argue that meaningful content is content that is replayable. Id also go so far as to say meaningful content is novel, and between the 4 main modes in gw2(story,pve, pvp and wvw) story is going to provide you with the least meaningful and novel experiences over the long term. 
---
So just to be succinct: meaningful content is objectively novel, novel experiences are few and far between when dealing with scripted content. 
---
Just to further clarify- the MOST popular games right now are games like pubg and fortnite, dota and LoL. Why are they so popular ? Well, competitive game modes are a gold mine of novel experiences. Just look at all the videos on youtube- those aforementioned game compilations/highlights with millions of views. These players KNOW the game has the opportunity to give them experiences they have never had before, so they come back, they spend money, they tell their friends.
---
There isn't anything that needs defending. So why would I defend myself?
---
The sad truth is it's probably not out of touch for the majority of players...
---
You mean you aren't excited about getting your gw2 leggings and poncho??
---
Not if it's budgetary, honestly. As shitty as it is, this is becoming more commonplace in a lot of industries -- fire your most expensive employees and replace them with somewhat-less-good but massively-less-expensive people.
---
You have a point there.  While I am looking forward to Strike Missions, when coupled with a story they don't seem like that will be expansion level quantity.  Maybe they meant expansion level quality?
---
Never in a million years did I think when I beat the end of EotN we would have a sequel that ended up like this. They should have gotten the dragons out of the way by expack 1 at least.
---
This is probably the reason, I agree. I've watched this community over the years, and it seems to have become a toxic mess, and I'm not sure when. Seeing all this toxicity really makes people not want to deal with the community. Hell, it's making me reconsider coming back to the game after sitting out the entire last season of LS.
---
Literally not every developer does this
---
Didn't expect strike mission, expected some kind of mount. [Got everything else tho.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/csjfn7/dont_miss_our_special_announcement_event/exfzgbc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
And yes I'm still disappoined, because that was the lowest of lowball predictions. At least it's not a mobile i guess?
---
Why do people treat ANet like it is a charity? The game made ~13 million last quarter ...
---
It is a business which means it should be offering stuff people will want to pay for.
---
So raids would be novel, because you have to work hard to get through them. Some of the LS achievements are hard for a lot of people, and they have to work hard to get through them. It takes many tries like a raid. Some of the content like metas are meaningful to some of the population. I simply don't agree with your definition of meaningful.
---
Joko's speech and the surprise thereafter was meaningful to me. One of my favorite moments in the game. In fact, I really liked that entire instance and have played it many times. Is it meaningful to you? Nope. But raids are not meaningful to me, that's sort of my point.
---
I think if you ask 10,000 people what meaningful content is, you'll get a surprising variety of answers.
---
Guild Wars was never supposed to be nothing but a game about fighting dragons and it makes me sad.
---
Anthem was really made in 1 year tho.
---
I think that future of real gaming (not visual novels and annual reskins) is in hands of smallest studios under 10 people.
---
Oh i want that aurene tee shirt
---
Hi! Just wondering, how often do seasons go on sale? I'm planning to purchase all the seasons but wanted to see if there was going to be a sale anytime soon (I expected it to go on sale during the anniversary but it didn't)
---
I would kill for another char slot, but Anet won't even let me BUY more...
---
The trailer was fantastic as far as I'm concerned.
---
I used to play Wrath Of The Lich King back in the day, was and still is my favorite WoW expansion, and this appears to be Arthas except he *is* the dragon rather than riding one. I am crazy excited.
---
Burner account gonna take it as a poke attempt till otherwise
---
Maybe, but why wouldn't they have canceled after the layoffs in February? If they really had been planning some project that was canceled, wouldn't they have known right then that it wasn't going to happen? Surely PAX could have used the theater for something else with 6 months' notice.
---
Lol fuck off
---
I played WvW for many years before quitting. Stop attrmpting to strawman the atgument. Have your every played any other mmo made in the past twenty years? Most of them start off with skills locked. Yes gw2s combat is great and more interactive. But it's also one of the reasons why it's so successful cause it's unique.
---
Just because you don't like a pve focused games and call it "suffering" doesn't mean the combat is slow. You might want to look up what off global cool down skills are.
---
Roadmap: yes, absolutely
---
Using Star Citizen as a comparison: probably not the best option
---
I didn’t think WP would be with us on this he’s usually very middle of the road on things like this but I felt his disappointment and I’m happy to see it bc it was a let down and WP tries to be very optimistic most of the time and he was like “yeah what was that”
---
I think the story will be good but they were so vague on everything it’s sad I was so excited to see new stuff but alas We got pop figures haha
---
Yeah. It was emphasis in the content being free.
---
Ditto.
---
I wish they'd given us an outfit voucher or gems.
---
I agree, the merchandise also serves to keep Anet's staff payed so that they can focus on the in game stuff as well. NCsoft doesn't take all the profit from the merch.
---
Build templates!!!!!
---
I’m also pleased with Jormag’s voice actor and hope he ends up being insidious.
---
I’m excited for build templates
---
Pretty good year fort the other major mmos with Shadowbringers and WoW classic. You guys have this.
---
Male commanders too.
---
It's tragic.  They lost my absolute favorite people.   Including the designer of my favorite jump puzzles!  If you're gonna keep one person damnit, keep him and let him torture me with his cruelty!
---
Guild Wars 2 is a 5 star game being maintained by a 1 star staff.
---
I'm honestly amazed how these same people even made a game this good and had this much potential to begin with.
---
Same, havnt bough anything in the gemstore for 9 months, just give me a product to buy ffs.
---
Expansion level features doesn't necessarily equal elite specs.  I don't know why everyone expected those  to be honest this is why anet is afraid to talk to us: we take a tiny nugget of information, blow it out of proportion, and then get disappointed when our wildest dreams aren't fulfilled. How would they release them?  One at a time? That'd be great for the profession that goes 9th.   All at once?  We get 690 from hot and pof, which leaves us with 190, needing 60.  There are 200 points in core, so you'd have to do around 60 of those to get the 250 you'd need.  And then people would complain about have to do core content to get their expansion elite   ls maps don't have hero points, so that's a no go too.
---
Idk, it's just a plausible scenario
---
True fax, me too my friend me too.
---
Its honestly too bad the combat system is so good. The content is clearly made for people who would be better off with tab targeting, click to move, global cool down combat system.
---
You just posted an [hour ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxon0g/the_devs_are_doing_great_work_am_i_wrong_for/).  You going to post the same content again in another hour?
---
Iam buying it from G2A thats why Iam asking
---
Not only didn't they say anything about raids, they also put it into a bad light by saying it's a huge time commitment.
---
So this 'Saga' thing, is it like a Campaign? No that cant be right, ive been told campaigns were expansions, so its like a mini campaign, right? but isnt that a season? Or maybe a Saga is a bigger release like a 3/4 expansion spread out over a number of months.
---
Or maybe those pesky PR people just changed the name...
---
Dead armor for dead mode. Well, at least they pretty fair with that.
---
Oof. Are you ready to fight... **ice griffons**? It’s just as annoying as a normal griffon, except somehow he can stay in the air for fifteen seconds while you spam attacks helplessly *and* do it all while being completely covered in ice. Wild.
---
I am a noob that started playing a couple days ago.
---
Should I buy the expacs now or just keep levelling whilst it's free? Im really enjoying following all the lore but there's not much direction as you mentioned
---
Yes, but what does completing a living world collection actually mean if the rest of the game is empty and dilapidated. 
---
People play mmos because their characters are extensions of themselves. If your characters achievements mean nothing because the world outside of those instances is empty, then the amount of people eager to complete such things drops significantly. 
---
Just to clarify, your example of jokos speech is great, I actually enjoyed it too, played through the instance 3 times on different characters, but then I went to wvw, joined a bunch of friends, and had a night of completely novel experiences, without needing anet to release more PvE. My point isn’t that your novel experience is invalid, its that retaining players with such a limited scope Isnt a great long term strategy.
---
I mean this effects wp’s bottom line just like anets. He wants it be good so usually he tries to ride that line but he couldn’t hide that disappointment.
---
You're spot on with this.
---
WvW is dead only thing that would save it at this point is that Arenanet give it away for players or another company to develop the mode as a standalone game. Nothing else will change anything, Arenante Dones not understand the game mode or the comunity or the meta, so it is impossible for them to develop WvW specially when they do nto comunicate wiht the players at all, if you are still playing GW2 for WvW u are doing it wrong my dude
---
They're NOT empty.  I don't know how you can argue they are, unless you're just not playing.
---
Delusional
---
Most of those people left in 2012
---
[Something like this?](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/85879/future-plans-competitive/)
---
[Or like this?](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/85188/potential-future-balance-changes)
---
I mean they're pretty much doing what you're asking. And what's the result? Well you can see for yourself, but I wouldn't call the overall mood of those threads "happy".
---
I definitely agree about needing a standard of communication, and I'm not gonna claim whether or not anet fulfills it as I don't follow them that closely, but it definitely seems like they do have some level of communication, the kind that you described.
---
The wreath is great. Too bad I already own it.
---
They should have given us an outfit voucher, a voucher for a complete armour set, appearance pack, or say, 800 gems to spend as we wish.
---
It's def possible, I'm sure the marketing part was NCSoft at any rate.
---
In this industry you "have to be brave" and retreat to your safe space immediately.
---
If the intent was to show us that they still care about the game, I can't help but think they managed to show us just how little they actually do care about the game. They put all this glitz and glitter together, but they don't actually have anything to show us. Not even basic, basic stuff like a UI for the build templates or whatever.
---
You went out of your way to mock someone for their opinion. Whether or not they feel hurt, doesn't change the fact that you were belittling them, and just plain being rude. You're simply trying to justify your behavior, and to be honest the only person you're fooling is yourself.
---
I’m....hyped about the pops.
---
Jormag ships and Rule 34 incoming.
---
The reason is because everybody is leaving the game. There is no TP lag when only 20 people are accessing it
---
You’re thinking short term. You’re forgetting that the players that inhabit wvw and pvp also are pve players. I never said they ARE empty, I’m suggesting that this path leads to players logging in, completing all the new pve content, and then logging out BECAUSE the rest of the game hasn’t been touched.
---
Well...  did you see the head of their marketing...  he thought that dress thing and those moon boots were a good fashion choice...  
---
I suddenly understand why the marketing has been so shit.
---
I think they said it could take up to 72 hours?
---
They don't even tell us what's happening and leaving us in the dark for things.
---
What makes you sure they kept their word on it?
---
Plus we might hit a 2 month release-schedule instead of the 3 to 3+ sometimes one we have now. Idk.
---
&gt; I have no idea what the content creators do or are
---
You and me both.  Throw theorycrafting in there for good measure, too.  Unless you mean prebuilding on GW2Skills, something I do for basically every game with stats (Grim Dawn, Ultima Online, etc).  I, too, have been playing pretty much since release.
---
I don't do that shit because it bores me.  Obsessively optimizing a build just means I spend less time doing the thing I like: going out and friggin' stabbing something.  Same with content creators.  Why watch a YouTuber/streamer when I could just play the damn game myself and, again, fecking shank something?
---
Switched to Aurora Peachy stream for a minute or so after big announcement. Yeah typical PMA shilling... but you know, for a second when she was talking about "Well we are finally getting that and that and this"... I saw a glimpse in her eyes of almost breaking in tears. 
---
Its fucking sad. GW2 community stuck with a game that no longer deserves that community.
---
Yeah he shouldn't feel so entitled, after all he makes free money off of anets work.
---
They mentioned pvp mini seasons but didn't explain what it actually means.
---
I think they did it that way to stress it was free for newer players. Or perhaps the Prologue may always be free with PoF while the other episodes follow the usual model.
---
Anet is a company that was before twitch and streaming, or even youtube was that much of a thing yet.
---
They're really really REALLY out of touch with internet culture, viral marketing or even basic marketing in general.
---
Basically Anet is your 60 year old aunt that thinks facebook is still the cutting edge of social media and sends you memes that are at least 10 months old, except in Anet's case, its not even memes, Anet hates memes.
---
They weren't announced. They were quickly mentioned and then on to the next thing. We didn't get any new information, all they said was that they are still working on it.
---
GW3 confirmed
---
&gt; I was really, really, hoping they wouldn't do what they did. But I was expecting it.
---
THIS IS ON YOU.
---
There is no one else to blame.
---
The outfit is free in the promotions tab.
---
I didn't get it in the mail, it was in the gemstore.
---
I’m on sorrows furnace but I see a queue for EB somewhat regularly.
---
in a way they kinda succeed? A friend of mine who doesnt play guild war 2 told me about it. 
---
But that just lead us to visiting this subreddit and going oh, oh dear, this aint gonna be good if u guys already have bingo card ready for this.
---
Well, it has a cartoon on it
---
&gt; [&amp;C1oAAAA=]
---
How do you get this?
---
Well, whenever you decide to define it for us will probably be the same time Arena.net produces any.
---
They did dig their own grave
---
Maybe put in some more time to find the right tempo with a much smaller team, but to do a countdown and hype nothing or something that is already known...well...
---
Offer them enough and you bet they'll at least consider (unless you're asking for something wildly out of line for the brand.)
---
 If the content **CAN** be rushed, it **WILL** be rushed. Thats a fact Anet needs to embrace. Achievement are not enough for casual players, that is also a fact. At this point, Anet should be planning around keeping the player base engaged in PVE by different means - NOT repeating the same things
---
They should just make the content harder, every single living world map has around the same level of difficulty, this has bred a player base who is just flat our disinterested because it all feels the same, minus the story. Which is also the reason why the story is played and the map is largely there just to be there
---
There is no replability when it comes to PVE maps for these reasons. In any MMO, the content should be getting harder, even more true for a game that has many different stats but less of an ability to powercreep via levels. This can also sell lower level maps. But Anet is scared as shit when it comes to the casual player base 
---
Its fucking asinine
---
Glad you are finding it useful. I just keep moving around the maps and I am finding that Peppercorns and Mint seem to be the harder to drop. But I have accumulated a decent number of all of them by going to various maps and also using my alts to get coverage. Doric, Sandswept and Kourna have a really decent number of drops for what they give.
---
i was thinking about grabbing a ticket yesterday and just red eye it to seattle for the event
---
I'm glad I decided against it
---
What's your internet speed?
---
Played both games for a long time as well. Was in love with the series since the start. I'm happy with the announcement. I like new content, I don't care if they delay it. I'm happy it's coming. Nothing more to say for me. I enjoy every part of the game. (Been playing solo since release as the small group of friends I have don't like mmorpg's)
---
nah, WP usually has fair and well-reasoned opinions. For blind fanboyism we already have aurorapeachy and her community.
---
DO NOT BUY FROM G2A.  Lots of players have had their accounts banned after buying from them.
---
The keys they sale are often bought with stolen credit cards.  The charges reversed once the rightful owner finds out, ArenaNet gets a chargeback, then your account gets banned.
---
I agree with some of you post.  
---
&gt; They oversaturated the gem store without adding attainable items via game. 
---
This is just not true.  Dragonfall 3 armor sets, each with a base version and a shiny version.   Thunderhead had weapons, base version and shiny.  Then there are the legendary trinkets that give varying levels of infusion like appearance.   Jahai Bluffs had two versions of armor too.
---
I'm not thinking short term. Your'e assuming that most of the population isn't dead set casual, and I think most of the population is, That's all. You might be right. I might be right too.
---
I wouldn't call this an update when they are just repeating stuff we already know. The entire post boils down to "we're working on it, it'll be ready *soon*". 
---
Also I like to keep in mind that this statement "Many of these plans could be changed dramatically or outright cancelled depending on changing priorities" Anet likes to lean towards the latter half, and if they don't tell us they cancel it outright they either pretend it was never a thing or keep stringing us on with more *soon* talk. 
---
Also as I was reading the thread this user Happy Yes's comment really hits hard on how Anet works "If you lend a friend some money and he says he'll pay you back "soon". At which point in time does this become a lie? That is debatable. PC gaming is a rapidly evolving business, not a charity, and they said "soon" over a year ago."
---
Anet is a meme honestly, and not a funny one either.
---
A good spot to farm Quality Red Meat includes the the mountains around [Derelict Delve WP](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fortune%27s_Vale). Lots of mobs that drop red meat in small packs, such as wolves, deer, moose, and wargs all around the mountain side.
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one!!!
---
There seems to be a specific type of person who likes funkos, in my experience. Greasy nerdy neckbeards (it's up there with grossly disproportionate anime figurines) or women who actually think the "pops" are cute.
---
Here is a [price tracking website](https://isthereanydeal.com/game/guildwarsiipathoffire/info/), that shows [DLGamer](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807) as the currently cheapest, legit retailer.
---
This
---
Been playing Warframe since totalbiscuit introduced it to the world and got as popular as it is today
---
They're incredibly transparent because they have the mindset and foresight to tell the player base bits of information that details their plans while also maintaining that the content is very likely to change. 
---
Anet is scared as shit of its casual player base. This excuse that they don't share information simply because it would lead to disappointment is absolute shit, why?Because it leads to disappointment.
---
Anet starts a hype train when they announce that "cOnTeNt Is CoMiNg SoOn" and allows unchecked imaginations and checklists of impossible goals and Anet enjoys doing the pikachu face when they blows up in their face. 
---
Fucking learn from your mistakes for christ sake. Your players WANT you to thrive and grow, we have as much stake in this as you guys do. We don't sit around complaining for our own health even if some criticism or hype is asinine.
---
"Not the gemstore outfit" title
---
Serves you right for having aspirations
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
There's 100 levels of 5 man content in the game already
---
That's my point! They gave us a huge hype announcement with a live session and countdown timer, which isn't really something they've done before, so it made everyone expect something *big* that they were keeping under wraps. I'm not saying the content of the announcement itself was the problem.
---
My title CLEARLY said , NOT the gem store store outfit
---
That's irony squared right here.
---
Okay , thanks. That's helpful , I appreciate it.
---
story bs? them be fighting words that's the only good thing to do in this game!
---
How do you guys stay invested? I’ve spent 2500+ hours in this game and spent atleast 200$ after my initial purchase but after this annoucement, my progress feel like they’re not worth it. Doing daily T4 fractals or grinding my chef to 500 doesn’t feel as rewarding anymore after the stream confirmed that we’re going in the exact same direction as before but without an expac that reinvented gw2, like gliders and mounts had done before. It feels like I’m investing a game that is barley afloat while games like WoW are skyrocketing everywhere. But I love gw2 with all my heart, but I just can’t seem to love it like I did before.
---
We dont get any info about the game because Mike doesnt want us to know, he clearly enjoys the radio silence, no one talks to us, and when they do, its we cant comment on that right now, or we will discuss it at a later date, people need to realize the ONLY way to make them change the way they are doing things is with cold hard $$
---
Do not buy any Gems or Gem Store related items, dont even convert gold to gems, just ignore the Gem Store completely, if this community actually got together and did this, Anet would change their tune really fast, almost any company will change their tune when the $$ dries up,
---
As it stands they are laughing at us, they keep radio silent, ignore 3 or 4 game modes, put stuff in the gem store and laugh, its like, we ignored them and they still give us the $$ this must be working, FYI the gem store is updated every Tuesday since Launch, it never fails, its always updated........
---
Anet rented a theater near PAX gaming convention to host an announcement about season5. They had a professional hype person and went through basically a limited blog post and some trailers. The event was hyped for a month, and people made it out to be huge deal. The community got incredibly over hyped and is now upset and disappointed that it wasn't more.
---
Well that makes sense but considering a end-game hard work required infusion can simply be out-shinnied by a BLC drop with just some real life dollar easily, and much better quality, I really think in a sense it’s becoming p2w. 
---
Not even one mount skin can be got from in game contents, except legendary backpack no glider skin accessible either... armors sets and weapons could be nice and obtained through game play but some gem store skins are just looking too nice still, and comparing to the effort of collection way too easy to get...
---
Even in some shitty Chinese pay to win mmo you still get good looking armors through collections, as you mentioned, but equally good/arguably better looking style items are always easily obtainable as long as you pay real life money... I hate to say it but this is buy to win... 
---
The new aspect greatsword made the sunrise I crafted in months look stupid, the new shinning blade backpack made me abandoned my ad infinitum ... all legendaries require hard work and a huge gold sink... sorry buddy this really feels p2w to me
---
And again, with the gear being irrelevant for 6 years and ppl playing this game mainly for fashion... sorry to say that man but gw2 is a pay2win game for now
---
&gt;dynamic lighting
---
*laughs in visual diarrhea without so much as a transparency slider*
---
You're right. I should have been more clear. My apologies. I meant things like mounts and items of that caliber. Legendaries were core and HoT. Both promised for those. So I would include them as a purchased feature (I bought core when it released). But things like there not being a single mount skin obtainable via game or that the new outfit over shadows an existing in game reward... I agree that you don't need the gems for fashion wars but it frustrating to see. Constantly investing in fluff to pull money from players rather that keep improving their products overall quality and health (All modes).
---
I've always been a bit bewildered listening to FFXIV content creators going, "Now, patch X.014335 is probably going to give us tweaks to specific role actions, mount movement speed and remove the currency cap on the latest trial. We should not expect a new extreme trial until patch X.0144."
---
And, I'm like, "where are they pulling this information from?!" As it turns out, XIV has an almost clockwork-like release cadence, so that patch 3.3 informs you on what to expect from 4.3, 5.3, etc. It gives a sense of long-term stability that is entirely alien to me as someone coming from GW2.
---
I love how people keep saying they don't think ArenaNet would do this when it was ArenaNet that thought diverting time and resources AWAY from the game was perfectly fine.
---
Exactly why do you think ANet wouldn't do this? I truly want to know.
---
Its not like they wouldn't have the tech for it. Remember the beta character slots that gave access to a different version of the game.
---
Nah they were just discussing some lore that i didn't have time to take down lol
---
Will never happen. But its a nice dream to have. Thankfully a large portion of the people that were in game in LA this afternoon were happy with the announcement, until the people from Reddit and the Forums logged back in.
---
Here's another one that stopped licking ANet's balls to suck up to them here.
---
&gt; The first mmo with dynamic lighting and real time battles. And full pvp with pve raids. Eve online doesn't stand a chance. 
---
Stop the drugs please.
---
There are 20 Fractals (not challenge modes), not 100.
---
please buy our hot topic tshirt
---
I somehow expected alliances, build templates and swiss tournaments are all in a near finished state that would be previewed today. They tell us since years they are working on them.
---
the game is sort of dead - people are massively uninstalling
---
this was the last straw.
---
it's irrelevant if stating this helps anyone, it's not meant to help. 
---
this reaction isn't destructive, it's an effect of anet's destructive actions.
---
anet should worry about new players not us, it's not our job to keep them coming. in fact they should know about anet's incompetence - i would appreciate being warned as a new player getting into collapsing game.
---
I've never watched one of WoodenPotatoes vids. Is he a Brit ? Just curious
---
When even God damn WoodenPotatoes takes our side, you know ANet has done a gigantic fuck up.
---
What is this referencing?
---
Also, let's not lie, people LIKE merch. Sure its not their #1 priority when they're raging about something else ... but people love figurines and t-shirts and whatnot.
---
I think you did better than everyone else at controlling your expectations.
---
Didn’t know it was intern
---
People are "outraged" because anet wasted money (after taking this "hit") on a theater booking, proceeded to hype the event and then showed close to nothing new. His reaction is just stupid/ignorant.
---
This sort of news could have been conveyed in a nicely made/cut video. If they have the kind of money to book a theater to show nothing then why did they "lay off" people lul.
---
Sadly one of my commanders would be inclined to agree with you (now that they’re not severely depressed lol).
---
Yep. They needed someone up there to speak precisely about PvP, WvW, and fractals/raids. Just saying something like "The next fractal and raid are in development. They'll be released when they're ready separate from Icebood Saga releases. We are expecting to produce one every X months."
---
If they literally are not developing the next raid or fractal, it may be smarter to not say anything. That makes them not acknowledging development pretty scary.
---
They also had great PvP news in the mini seasons that can include the ranked 2v2 queue that people have been asking for. They botched the announcement of it and it came off like a footnote.
---
If there was even one. ONE. Single mount skin available for unlock in-game, the community would feel so much better about the copious amount of monetization on mounts. But there isn't, they literally couldn't give us ANY mount skins as in-game rewards in 2 years.
---
Everything you are saying is ignoring the fact that we got less than what was repeatedly promised, casually or not, it was promised by Arenanet. If you don't include the transitions of people walking on and off stage, we got only 15 minutes of actual news about living world, you know, the thing they spent a month spreading the word about a 45 minute presentation for. No matter how you slice it, today was not utilized in any way that they made it seem like they would, casual or not, player epxectations or not. We objectively did not get the presentation that was advertised repeatedly, we got what felt like, to the vast majority of the community, silent majority and vocal minority, a slice of what was advertised to happen today. Opinionated as you may try to argue that is.
---
I agree, but I think that it came across as "disingenuous," if that's the right word for it. I wrote this earlier:
---
"So much of the announcement seemed focused, not on giving current players an idea of what to expect going forward, but on convincing non-players to start playing or buy the expansion. Several times when I was watching this I was struck with the strong feeling that the real reason they held this event was to get media to report on it so that non-players might read and try the game out.
---
It's okay to want to attract new players - they ought to be doing that - but the problem is that it felt like they were trying to game the media to re-announce the game they already have instead of creating something worthy of an announcement which would attract people on its merits."
---
Attracting new players is good, but if their approach to doing so was to sortof "trick" people into paying attention rather than actually creating something worth paying attention to, it's not going to go well in the end. 
---
Another big problem is that if you're trying to attract new people to something (a game, a business, a school, a church, anything) you can't go about doing that *at the expense of* the people you already have, or in a way which puts so much focus on the new people that you wind up neglecting the current. If you do that, you run a high chance of losing enough of the people that you already have that you're unlikely to make it up in new people, and even if you don't do that, you're making pretty sure that when any new people show up they're going to see a lot of discontent people already there and it's not going to sell them on the experience very well.
---
I didn't read or see any spoilers going in to today's announcement, and watched everything unfold on Mighty Teapot's twitch stream. Now, as a massively multiplayer content player, as in open world and WvW, I was pretty hyped by the PvE that's on the way. Strike Missions sound like bite-sized raids - awesome. World lore, awesome.
---
Personal Story? Nah, I lost interest in "The Commander" years ago - it's just not my character. But despite not being engaged by the Personal Story, I treat the game as an Elder Scrolls type sandbox. Making my own adventures is something Guild Wars 2 provides plenty of opportunity for. I know many other players have their own head canon for what is going on, separate to the official story. Honestly, following Braham is going to be a real chore - and I say that as a norn, who was looking forward to breaking that damn tooth myself. Oh well.
---
Overall then, there IS new content coming that's got me excited. I WOULD like fresh WvW maps, a DX11 engine, and a Personal Story that respected MMO structure rather than followed book structure, but well, that's life.
---
Something that did make me very sad was the Might Teapot stream. Teapot is a cool guy, but like, the crowd he's in is a super hardcore raiding niche and those people were gutted. Thing is, I don't play the content they play. Perhaps 80%+ of the players don't care to raid, because we don't want our lives to revolve around a video game. No, I did that in Dark Age of Camelot 15+ years ago and resolved not to do it anymore.
---
Everyone should experience static group raiding in one game or other, stop when the burnout hits, and then don't look back. Eventually, every hardcore player slows down and joins the casual trash. I am proud to be casual trash. Skilled, but not committed. When you're no longer a "content locust", finishing a month's worth of content in two days, but rather actually taking a month to finish a month's worth of content, then you're the kind of player who can see that actually... there is a lot to do in Guild Wars 2.
---
If there is one type of hard open world content I'd like to see more of, it's Triple Trouble and Chak Gerent type stuff. I miss meta events failing 90% of the time. Content that is actually massively multiplayer rather than this 10 man stuff. I know there are raiders that like it, but really, how is 10 man "massively multiplayer"? Let's get some more multi-squad 150 man behemoths to kill again. Those are fun times!
---
What surprises?
---
When Dragonfall was gonna be released they explained literally every part of the Skyscale mount except the grind behind it. They hyped us ***a month*** before their annoucement was made. They created a freaking timer 2 days before their ”big” annoucement. What do we get? An episo-***cough cough*** saga that offers even less than the previous one.
---
My issue is that the raid dev's are taking time away from making challenging experiences for the people that want them. If they made raids WITH an east mode for casual players with easy tweaks that don't take a lot of dev times like lowering boss damage, removing enrage timer, and lowering boss health I think that would be amazing. The issue is that they are spending time making new fights that arent challenging when we get basically 1 raid a year. They have proven it takes them LONG time to make new content. This is wht it frustrates me that they are putting so much dev time into a new raid like experience that will he easier, when they could modify existing content and get us more raid content with a much smaller delay.
---
People have no obligation to empathize with the problems their studio is facing, especially when the cause of all of those problems is their detachment from the interests and problems of their players. Do they empathize with how much disappointment I feel with their game? I think not.  
---
Unfortunately, this response is part of the problem. Way too many Anet devs pull up the victim card when their studio is criticized for the low quality of the only product it's delivering. I don't really care about who Matthew Medina is and what his opinion on this or that matter is. The developers from Anet are supposed to be professionals. My own clients don't try to pull up the "we are all humans" card and expect me to do the same. That's the essence of professionalism, which implies a certain degree of detachment too.   
---
Speaking about which, a critical lack of *professionalism* in how this fiasco of a reveal stream was marketed and conducted is staggering.
---
since when was HoT purchasable on the trading post???
---
"Players who bought *Guild Wars 2: Heart of Thorns* through the **Black Lion Trading Post** or our official website between July 31 and August 30, 2019,"
---
I was really looking forward to elite specs.  I made a new elementalist and everything.
---
It really is. In game. This sub is no bearing on the game's actual community.
---
I am also exited for those but keep in mind that ArenaNets understanding of hard content may not be the same as most of the reddit thinks about it. If anything the freezie analogie works best. I would not expect multiple difficulties or general hard challenges. Wing seven is a thing and if those missions are an entry level to raids, well, than they have to be easier than that. For now I assume they are refined bounties or worldbosses where the challenges comes from a limited number of players involved in the fight. As much as I would like to see more it is - at the moment - all that we should expect from that feature. Would not be suprised if it ends up as a holo arena 2.0 event type. And those bosses were not hard ... they simple took a while.
---
Good point. Definitely something I have to put more thought into.
---
I've tried the "I'm moving to FFXIV"-technique at least ten times. After GW2, it's like switching from heroin to powdered sugar. I even grew to love the world and the story, enjoy trials and everything, but the gameplay foundations, those damned tab-target-GCD-WoW-relics from almost two decades ago, are just rotten. Or at least I've grown allergic to them after maining GW2 for so long. Hope you have more more success.
---
It's not "the feature I wanted was not announced" it's "nothing we didn't already knew got announced". I mean we got strike missions. Yay, i'm whelmed.
---
They could've just made a blogpost "LWS5 starts at september 17." and it would be the same thing. They could even do more blogposts with "Look at out newest world boss drakkar" and "Strike Missions - they're raids but not" or "7 years late - Build templates join the party" to build some hype. It would be fine. The game would stil be in a state of limbo, but they would've saved some money for that pointless announcement.
---
Graphics overhaul, revived community, maybe new expansions.
---
Guild wars 2 is a completely different game I miss the old mechanics
---
&gt; even less than the previous one
---
Wth are you talking about?
---
This will probably get me downvoted, but are we really supposed to be giving Anet kudos for somehow staying afloat after these layoffs when their piss poor decision-making was what put themselves underwater in the first place? Yes, congratulations. You managed to not *totally* drive your game into the ground. Let me shower you with money as you keep releasing mount skins every other month while maintaining radio silence on the direction of this game for almost a year. Think of all the time and labor that could have gone into this game rather than projects that were doomed to be scrapped anyway. All that wasted time and labor. For nothing. 
---
Like... we are only NOW getting build templates when people have been asking for them since 2012?! You can’t really call that “Anet listening to us.” Seven years and now they finally give us build templates? We should have gotten build templates when the first elite specs came out with HoT. Fuck, Anet is so out of touch with the GW2 player base it’s not even funny. 
---
What we really want is regular communication and a fucking road map to show us this dying game isn’t actually going to die. That’s it. And it would take so little effort on their part in comparison to what they’re doing now.
---
/rant
---
Same sadly.
---
The announcement is great for players who are relatively new to the game or have a lot of things on their to-do list.
---
There are a lot of players who played this game over the last 7 years and to be honest wit you, we don’t have anything we can do in this game anymore. 
---
More and more old school players will leave. And with Little to no things to look forward to we will leave sooner rather than later.
---
So damn tru. But gauss is fast boye
---
Yea i bet every player did at leasr one build, so we have less then 10 metabuilds so this guild has less then 10 ppl?
---
It's sooo preeeettyyyyyyy
---
ANet you need to stop fucking up lol
---
Explain?
---
How would anyone be not fine with that?
---
please buy their merchandise and gems to support another year of nothing :)  
---
guild stuff? mmo stuff? not single player stuff? content?  not its just story from now on made by skeleton crew. Game was abandoned after HoT and is in maintance mode with story only. Nothing amazing to look for, nothing to be hyped about. Even new mastery is lore based..
---
agreed! (and I couldn't for the life of mine get that achi of not getting hit by the krait)
---
GW2 having the best community was just a circle jerk people liked to perpetuate. Under the surface it was toxic as fuck due to the massive divide between what casual players want and what hardcore players want.
---
Warframe devs actually interact with the players, both on the clock and in their off time, they stream multiple times a week, have dedicated dev streams where they actually explain why they do certain things and why other things take time or don't work. Pretty much everything gets laid out so you know what to expect, they have a partially community driven gem store where talented players can design and create skins for the game, a few even landed a job at DE because of it. Overall the community is amazing and in game very helpful. The game has very unusual content that's both fun but also samey, vets are frustrated with the lack of challenging content and DE acknowledged it and is slowly releasing pretty good results. With more on the way!
---
Arenannet is just a group of talented devs restricted by old corporate money hungry sluts :/
---
The difference comes from the difference in scope of the two games and how they grew over time.  Warframe was advertised as a PvE game from day one, being small in scope mostly being mission-based.  They added PvP eventually with Conclave, but it was always a PvE game.  With things like Plains of Eidolon or Railjack coming as the expansion of scope as the team at DE could take it on.  DE sees massive delays the way Anet does, often their delays for features are as long or longer than some of Anet's delays, but despite having their own Warframe themed convention they have done all they can to avoid overhyping things.
---
GW2 was advertised from the start as practically being three separate games smashed together:  a PvE MMO, a PvP game with esports aspirations and WvW being this massive seige warfare game.  They were massive in scope from the start and had to reduce their scope over time as things failed to come together.  We saw this with how different season one was from season two, then how different season two was from three or four.  With each time they had something fall short or fail to come together there were content draughts with zero communication.  Look at the year between HoT and season 3, then the short turn around between season 3, season 4 and PoF.  It is possible that season 5 could have started already had the layoffs not happened and focus not wind up shifted.
---
Really DE and Anet have had the opposite problems of each other, DE has been expanding scope and growing as they succeed.  While, Anet have had to refocus, shift focus and think smaller as things never quite worked out.
---
Damage control.
---
They’ve been saying future updates, ideas, can’t reveal at this time for almost 2 years.
---
I think it would be mixed for sure. It's a discussion we should all put thought into cause I can see how it would be a slippery slope now.
---
Well, if we're going north, there's a chance we could visit the Woodland Cascades, which is the centaur Homeland.
---
Weekly livestreams and putting on the table what the team is working on with demonstrations of what they're working on, bugs and all.
---
Community managers actually playing the game's content, experiencing the bugs first hand and helping with the process of getting it fixed.
---
Asking the the founder community about things that could be implemented into the game in regards to mods or suggestions.
---
A large sense of community by encouraging users to design skins for items in game and implementing said skins in game as well as compensating each skin to their designers when they implement them on consoles. 
---
Support of streamers for streaming their game, allowing each streamer to have their logos available to wear as a profile image in game at a specific milestone as well as providing said streamers with things to giveaway on their streams to entice audience of the game.
---
theyre going for FF14 trials. wherein you q up port to boss and spank him , titan flashbacks landslides everywhere!
---
Warframe's problem is that people basically break the content by exploiting overpowered frames and weapons and then cry when people ask for balance.  
---
Can't even tell you how many times I've been told to go fuck myself because I wanted Ember's aoe to stop making low level areas pointless and boring.  
---
Anet's problem is that content is simply left to rot.
---
Glad you finally woke up, and please throw those rose tinted glasses away.
---
Dragon fall offered us a new map, an ending to two big plots (death of kralk, ascendens of Aurene), two armor sets for each weight class, ***a brand new mount***, new masteries and revisting the old one from heart of thorns, a viable farming route, new use of volatile magic(trophy cases) and I can probably go on for longer.
---
All of these in one way or another was content. You can’t play lore so that’s a whopping 7 minutes gone. There’s been no update to PvP or WvW so we know that efforts haven’t been pulled from PvE into either of those two gamemodes. They hyped this new sto-I mean ”saga” and presented nothing big other than a 10 man boss. There’s literally nothing significant to this event.
---
I think there's a difference between the communities in different areas of the game. The reddit community has been pretty loud and discontented lately.
---
The purpose of revenant's hammer is ranged poke, obviously. It has one mediocre CC skill barely worth its cast time if it lands. That's like saying mesmer greatsword is for CC just because its skill 5 is a hard CC.
---
Also, it's balanced in PvP, and weak in PvE, so it needs to stay the same in PvP and get buffed in PvE, instead of getting nerfed in both of those modes just because of WvW. They can do this while still making the damage be the same each pulse, just make the damage higher in PvP and even higher than that in PvE.
---
it is irresponsible to put the helpful, non toxic people in game that make the experience for most players so good in the same boat as all the disappointed redditors. if you like this game, you owe to the good part of the community that is too busy helping new players and being a kind a welcoming presence to not explain the difference should someone ask you in the future if this game has a good community.
---
If they didn't alter the lore (much) I would agree.
---
The community needs to stop treating people like shit when they ask for help.  Sorry to say, but you're part of the problem.  We know very little about this system right now, and if they structure it correctly people *should* want to improve.  Perhaps they won't learn "perfect" rotations or gameplay, but those have never been necessary to excel at the game, and condescending elitism isn't helpful.  
---
Several months ago I did a 99cm run where an inexperienced Warrior tripled their DPS after I talked to them for about 10-15m while we were waiting for another player to join.  GW2 often ends up being many people's first RPG it isn't unreasonable for them not to understand build and gameplay synergy.  I get that you're frustrated and want more content, but expressing the opinions that you do -- implying casuals are trash and crybabies -- before they've even taken a swing at the system?  In a word.  Problematic.
---
he shouldve pushed more, they can only dodge so much before running out of endurance
---
Is this crucible glyph removed from the game now?
---
I would rather pay for them ,even real money If we would get elite specializations with them. It will be a hard year for me playing only some story every 3 months and on same old skills. I dont like achievements so this saga look like just story for next year or 2..
---
&gt;Are you trying to gaslight me, while agreeing with others?
---
The guy I agreed with had a reasonable tone and message.  
---
&gt; You seem to have no problem fluctuating between sides for the karma though
---
It's ok to acknowledge when someone else, who holds a different view point than me, makes a valid point.  That is how my parents use to have conversations, but it seems that is not alwayss possible on social media today.   I have a question for you, how many times in a day do you use "gaslight"?
---
&gt;Outside of this subreddit and the occasional late night LA rant
---
LMAO where the fuck are you even seeing people talk about GW2 outside of those two places exactly?
---
They barely seem to have the teams to deliver the content they try to deliver now, there are still bugs in core, HoT and LW that have yet to be fixed.  Their content teams for PvP and WvW are borderline non-existent.  Even if they wanted to port this game they don't have the staff or the resources to do so.
---
He used to be Arenanet's marketing guy, but I'm guessing during the layoffs the marketing team got moved to NCSoft, so now he does marketing for all their games.
---
His outfit was awful indeed.
---
The announcement was ANet's make or break moment and it sucked.  It should have been a blog post instead of a marketing stunt. 
---
It's officially the beginning of the end for GW2.
---
&gt; but they always get the final word.
---
So you do assume they have a huge influence then.
---
&gt;Anet made a great game, but they can't keep it great because NCsoft made them understaffed.
---
It's amazing the lengths some of you go to to defend Arenanet.
---
Delusional.
---
Like I said, If NCSoft was that in charge - We would be seeing P2W shit for sure.
---
*looks back at the "45 minute living world presentation" advertisements,* 
---
*looks at the 15 minutes of actual living world discussion that will probably be it now until the 17th*
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Probably when press ppl get home and put them on ebay for 3 digits.
---
the 15 minutes of what people came to see was very good,
---
it was supposed to be 45 minutes, and its probably all we are going to get now until the 17th
---
they introduced strike missions but failed to elaborate more on it. it is basically a copy of FF14 trials. wherein you q up , bop a boss loot rinse and repeat
---
Is this a cult or something? wtf
---
some of the merch was great, and im gonna buy some, but i can guarantee you anyone that was willing to pay for the travel and lodging just to be there was expecting more than just 15 minutes of the substance they were repeatedly promised 45 minutes of
---
If ANet didn't suffer from *hilariously incompetant* management, then there wouldn't have been any layoffs. They shuffled their best devs off to side projects and left the game that was *actually* making them money to flounder.
---
You can't pretend ArenaNet isn't at fault here.
---
I can't believe white knights on this subreddit have driven me to defending NCsoft of all companies. Jesus.
---
Couldn't have said it better myself.
---
&gt;I may be wrong of course, but IMO it looks like GW2 PvE is going back to it's roots atm.
---
It's roots were dungeons, We are not going back to dungeons so yes - You are indeed wrong.
---
Dude, honestly fuck off with the entitled bullshit.  It's their game, no one gives a shit about what you want.
---
This whole fucking community cries and cries because Anet doesn't hand out legendaries at level one.
---
Absolutely agreed. DE is amazing at keeping players constantly in the loop of things they're working on and keeps their update concepts tangible. Rebecca (and her team) in particular did/does a great job of engaging with the community to make sure concerns are heard and keeps a dialogue going between players and devs. From their early days of struggling to stay afloat they realized just how important that communication is and kept investing into improving it.
---
... but the devs also constantly do stuff that just pushes me further away from the game. Deleting Trials was a big thing, adding Riven mods and dragging out Focus grinding was another. Things like being stubborn about univac is another. Lots and LOTS of bugs and too many cases of seemingly not respecting player time. The game is also imbalanced as hell and laughably easy. Plus, as you hinted at, there's a ton of stuff DE works on for extended periods of time and their profit line lives/dies on how many new players they bring back in each time.
---
I still really appreciate DE and Warframe but I've gotten further and further away from it.
---
While I wish Anet was more communicative with us, I feel like I have a lot more to do and a lot more challenging content to do regularly in GW2. Everyone has a different threshold / goal in mind with GW2 for what they want out of it and I feel like I'm not even halfway through mine so far. In Warframe I feel like I'm just collecting stuff for the sake of collecting it now.
---
A very well put, reasonable statement.  You need to figure out how to bottle your calm and sell it.  The world needs you.
---
Unfortunately I agree...I played Scholar and Samurai into EX Innocence and Titania and did the first new Savage Eden Resurrection...you can't deny that combat is slow....press x then y to get z then press shift x to get shift y to get shift z and then press Mega X followed by Mega Y and then start over. 
---
The mechanics are pretty amazing in FF14 buy player combat is slow, especially compared to GW2 and ESao..  I'd even say WoW is faster without the GCD
---
Actually, that’s what divorcees answer most would have saved the relationship. The true key to a healthy relationship is respect. Communication comes with respect, but there’s so much more to it.
---
"Buy more lootboxes and cool skins that you'll never be able to earn in-game we love you so much!"
---
It's a bait thread. Don't expect OP to reply to anything.
---
Bet you anything this venue was reserved a year ago, well before the layoffs. It's PAX weekend in Seattle; you're not going to be able to reserve a theater on late notice.
---
That said, they could have found other uses for the rental than hyping living story like this. They could have done Guild Chat with a live audience or simply thrown another party like they did for the 5th anniversary at PAX a couple of years ago (that was super fun.)
---
Of course it's content and i'm pretty sure everyone is well aware of that. It's just that people tend to over exaggerate on disappointments to emphasize on how upset they really are. I dont think it matters whether they say "no content" or "not enough" or "not the right content" the point they're trying to make comes across either way, and it's just a little more memorable and provocative if they over exaggerate it like this, in hopes of having Anet finally listen to them..
---
THAT'S considered being made fun of? **lmfao**
---
Pretty psyched about getting more Norn stuff and more shiverpeaks.  They're BY FAR the best looking areas in the game.
---
Where exactly did you get that during the saga there will be no new mounts, no new armor sets, no plot twists, no new masteries (they already talked about one and finally making use of old ones again)?
---
Charrception
---
I had to open a ticket to get mine, I got the mail but it had nothing attached to it.
---
Ran out of time? It was barely over half an hour. Wasn't it supposed to be 1h?
---
But you press F and sometimes dodge an aoe or two! That's thrilling gameplay and deep content right?
---
So tru
---
HA! i love to tease these elite babies ingame. i went to aerodome  to ask stuff since they are quitting anyway lol i probably got reported for voicing my opinion.  these emotional babies got their feelings hurt, they felt betrayed, they're angry, pissed because anet didn't bend to their demand, they will quit for sure but they'll be back in no time. hahah babies
---
Im not jason but im bald. Does that count?
---
Yeah, everyone deflecting to it entirely being NCsoft's fault is just the biggest tinfoil hat conspiracy theory ever.
---
It’s people like this deluded cunt why this company is failing.
---
Vet since beta with 6k hours here. I'm really happy with the announcement except for the tacky merch sale that was for some reason presented to be the climax of the whole event.
---
Funko pops are asura.
---
You should eventualy also get a unique glider skin, and some other goodies. But ye, I getcha.
---
Anyone who payed any attention would have known 6 months ago that there was no plans for another expansion until after season 5.
---
A star to guide us?
---
Isn't that what happened with Guild Wars when they started working on Guild Wars 2?
---
The free HoT one looks better idk .
---
Lol, you are funny. You think the bitching is for an enhanced easy mode? There have been community requests on the board for YEARS (6 years+) that Anet agreed they would look into. There are still Bugs in the game (Some since Day one) that are game breaking that have yet to be fixed. There are legit concerns that a lot of players have about the game that do need to be addressed officially. Instead we get shitty merch (sad, i was hoping for Minis and such) and nerf WvW/PVP pre-patch ideas. It's not entitlement when you do not expect anything, then you get less then what you expected.
---
HoT wasn't received well by the casual/unskilled/unwilling to adapt part of the playerbase. Anet got scared to repeat the "mistake" and released PoF which was the literal opposite, and which wasn't received well by the hardcore part of the playerbase (that was nurtured/attracted by HoT btw). I get the feeling that Anet is lost and scared. They're dashing from one polar opposite to another, trying to appeal to everyone, but ultimately leaving everyone disappointed.
---
P.S. I'm all up for more expansions like HoT.
---
Prologue is a new map. Ep1 &amp; Ep2 share a new map.
---
It's still new maps. Just not necessarily an entirely new one with every episode.
---
This^
---
If anything the layoff was a good thing, it got rid of the fat and moved more people to actively working on GW2 so that they now have 4 teams actively working on the game instead of 2.
---
Something like Marvel does to map out the next phase of movies at comic-con would have been easy to emulate.   
---
I am fearful that raids are going to be the next dungeons in terms of abandoned content.   I have not raided in over a year, but I feel a healthy raiding community is good for the overall health of the game.   Not mentioning them at all today worries me.
---
Hold on, I have to clean this vomit off my desk.
---
&gt; They called the next release a prologue, but know that it will have a new zone (in Grothmar) and may be comparable to a season 4 episode. And that launches in two weeks.
---
I feel like they are going to release some of the new zones in waves like with Drytop, so the maps look and feel fully developed. In that light, calling this a saga makes sense because will have more time to fully build solid maps. I'll just point the [Gandara](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cquofk/please_anet_i_beg_of_you_make_use_of_gandara_the/) as a prime example of building too big for a short amount of time.  If the go that way then the maps will be dense and rich. Maybe even 2 chapters per map with strike missions? Either way the new story arch looks amazing! 
---
&gt;On the note of the plot itself, the fact that the trailer seemed to hint at the other two remaining dragons just as much as Jormag may suggest that Jormag knows something we don't about the others, or that we might actually need to seek his help to deal with them.
---
Kralkatorrik did call out to his mother in the end so... whether that is the DSD or a non-elder dragon (something worst) is the question. Not knowing how dark this saga is going to get is really worth it.

---
One is a Charr the other one doesn't fit GW2 , because it's a god damn furry .
---
Excuse me, PSO?!?!?! I haven’t heard that name in FOREVER!!! I’ll have to look it up!!!! That makes me pretty hype!!!
---
You sound like you're trying to convince yourself more than anyone else, honestly.
---
The thing for me about the Saga change, is that I can't imagine Anet in its current state investing MORE resources than when they were working on both LS3 and PoF at the same time. So either they are basically lying when they say Sagas are bigger than Seasons, or else they are in fact taking LS bigger with Sagas because they aren't working on an expansion. And I find WP's idea of their business heads thinking they can get xpack style returns by just giving xpack style marketing to LS way too on the nose.
---
Yup! Looks pretty interesting. I am entirely unfamiliar with PSO series though. Pretty excited for it!
---
Torchlight MMO?? I know 2 is on the consoles now, and 3 is in alpha (and honestly it’s fun! Got myself a pass, and it’s amazing!) but haven’t heard of an mmo
---
Why even do the dailies? Free yourself. You'll enjoy the game more when or if you return.
---
Maybe it's better to not expect anything and just let it happen, much healthier!
---
I thought it was the casuals who want story at a much faster pace than what ANET provides.  And the hardcore gamers raid, and/or do daily tier 4 fractals, or live in WvW.
---
Mobile games seem to do perfectly fine without expansions...
---
For a more recent example, take the Animal Crossing reaction from E3. 
---
AC: "Hey, the game was looking alright, but we want to deliver something *awesome* so we are delaying it 5 months."
---
Community: "Well that's dissapointing, but if it's going to make the game that much better, I can wait."
---
When you explain what's going on and why, the community has no issues with it. Anet has used layoffs to explain why things are going the way they are right now, but we have no idea what that really meant for the company. I just wish Anet would tell us *something* about what's going on. Can we expect new fractals? A new raid? What about the maps? How many new maps can we expect and how much will they be changing them throughout the season? And what about elite specs? Will there be another expansion? How about the amount of content we can expect in this new style of living world? There are just so many unknowns, and their silence on the topic is making the community *very* nervous about the future. 
---
Of course the devs are human, but the community is human, too (shoutout to any dogs on the subreddit). If the devs said, "Hey, the layoffs hit the company hard and we will need to switch to a slower content stream and fewer new features this time around. We would like to make another expansion, but it is going to come a little slower than PoF and we are going to focus on Living World for now," I'm sure the community would not have had an issue with it. Yeah, we'd be dissapointed, but we wouldn't be upset with Anet like we are right now.
---
They just left us in the dark, and the community is quickly losing confidence in Anet.
---
Mmmmm, idk if anet is around the middle....
---
was thinking that yeh
---
Well hopefully PAX was worth the trip
---
They did completely swallow Anets marketing department, and such an event is something marketing would organize,... plus the odd guy with the sales pitch was from said department.
---
You have no understanding of other people. See your MD , and get your meds adjusted.
---
radeon rx 580
---
It's almost like they knew they were going to get this reaction and set this up ahead of time lol.
---
"The mods should ban every discussion I don't like" is what you are actually trying to say here, but framing it as being against "toxicity" is a weak attempt at making you not look like a shill.
---
tl;dw-
---
"Like a lot of hardcore players I hyped myself up expecting the devs to discuss things the devs made no indication they would discuss. Here's my usual half hour of wild speculation to pad it out."
---
It's a more mild version of the notice me sempai meltdown the other hardcore players have been going through in the sub.
---
Good to know.
---
My bet is, new PC stand in to replace Duncan
---
Hmm , interesting.
---
Yeah, I remember a few years back when Anet announced that they'd be cancelling the rest of the second gen legendary weapons (obviously they did a 180 on this later) and WP went absolutely apeshit on them.  This was at the peak of the content drought after HoT launched, and boy oh boy was this the final straw for a lot of people.  He even said that he was thinking of quitting.  Obviously he didn't, but it shows that when Anet screws up, WP will 100% call them out on it.
---
TBH I'll probably stick to GW2 until it dies but I definitely can't wait for TES6 to scratch my fantasy game itch. It's less about GW2s performance and the lack of any alternative that I'd prefer.
---
How are we supposed to get this context? As a developer I totally understand the want or NEED to distance yourself from your customers.. plenty of people are negative for no reason or have no clue what they are talking about and it can totally put you in a bad state of mind. But I would also NEVER spend a month hyping people up just to tell them that im still working on things I annouced several YEARS ago without giving them ANY new information on my progress. Thats why everyone is upet.
---
Yup. It was a bug. They fixed it.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that prevented the Customer Appreciation Package from being available to players in certain regions.
---
Just check their history. Certified shill. All you need to know.
---
Hmm , I think I played for about 2 years from launch ? Maybe only 18 months. There's a good amount of actual content added ? Not just F2P store junk?
---
I feel for Matt and Anet, but this just sounds like he's going knee-jerk and trying to angrily guilt-trip everyone in the PvP community who was hoping for Anet to actually change things around for their most neglected game mode, instead of just tossing breadcrumbs at them.  And I don't even care about this game's pvp LOL
---
Oh, I have them RES tagged. I have made it my mission to call them out on it every time I see them shill in this subreddit. He is by far the biggest shill this subreddit has.
---
&gt;"No. They must release this specific feature or I will not be happy."
---
That's pretty much the fullness of it.
---
I've said it before, but put GW2's combat into literally any other MMO and I'd be playing it for months on end.
---
The only thing GW2 is really lacking is a compelling world and content to use that system *in*.
---
or 
---
top - baby elites who play 8-14 hours a day
---
bottom - people with life, who enjoy quality, free updates and content release
---
Take a break, play something else. No game can make you invest in them forever.
---
blatant lies = discussion
---
- /u/ThisIsAllSoStupid
---
If you're wondering why I posted this - I think it's important to get some sort of quantifiable measurement of where the community stands on this, since I noticed there actually seems to be a disconnect between different types of players.
---
Yep name calling definitely makes your point valid. Nice try though.
---
Well lets seeee
---
The examples you used of "blatant lies" are fucking strawman arguments, for one.
---
I really want to know more about this daddy dragon now.
---
I hate to say this because I was hoping I would be proven wrong but Anet stated it was a big announcement just to get the community riled up and get people talking. This sadly is not doing them any favors.
---
There's few others too.
---
I would wager a guess that ANet's developers are also frustrated by management, so they try and put their all into it to make it better, and when it's still not enough to fix management's fuck-ups, they start taking it personally. It's definitely irrational, but it's hard to be rational when something you worked your ass off for still isn't meeting expectations. Everything would likely be better if higher-ups actually knew what they were doing and gave a shit.
---
yeah, hinawerdan is just the absolute worst of them.
---
He consistently comes into almost every thread that is critical of the game or of ANet and shills.
---
But they don't stick around...
---
Most people in my personal circle just play the new story content and then drop it like a used napkin. A few will stick around to do the new collection, or whatever, because they're so desperate for something to *do*. But that's it.
---
GW2's just utterly lacking in content to keep even a casual player coming back to play and have fun with.
---
How do you plan to compensate for the brigrading?
---
Disappointed, but at least Archeage unchained is looking really good.
---
I bought my copy of HoT through the gem store but you can't buy it with gems. Only real money.
---
So who wants to place bets on how long that thread takes to get deleted?
---
I am guessing ten minutes.
---
hey this is you SO, its our endearment, right? baby
---
I disagree. theres always going to be negaive people who have no idea what they are talking about who will bitch and moan no matter what. but the reason roadmaps are a thing and work so well is that it gives the community an idea of what to expect. sure SOME people are going to freak out if a project does not work out or takes longer than originally expected... but over all the 2 methods that seem to have the most success are either to do a roadmap and regularly update it, letting people know what you have been working on. what is being scrapped and why so and so forth.. OR just dont make annoucements until things are actually done.   
---
For anet to annouce things with zero time frame.. and then never update the community or update us once a year with no more information but "were gonna be working on this soon... again"  is not going to go over well.. for anyone.
---
Have a whinge mate. It's not our job as consumers to sympathise with the plight of a company. What was announced could have been done on their website. There was no reason to announce an event a month in advance and provide a countdown simply so we could hear the same thing we hear every LS season. Arenanet did this to themselves - they built themselves up for failure.
---
&gt; and I haven’t seen anyone defending Anet at all
---
Check hidden posts (due to downvotes) at the bottom of the threads. You will see plenty of them. Downvote button is disagree button no matter what mods/admins claims otherwise.
---
Personally I agree. I find dragons are a neat side thing in stories that can come in for a major punch, but I'm not a fan of the entire story revolving around them. Notably, I don't find them to be sympathetic or compelling villains.
---
How do we know that?
---
lmao, ok whatever you say man.
---
On one hand, twitch chat is not an accurate representation of the community, but on the other hand, yeah it kinda left a bit to be desired
---
Here, take your pick:
---
WoW Cassic good gw2 bad  
---
FF14 good gw2 bad  
---
Digital Extremes good Arenanet bad  
---
GGG good NCSoft bad
---
Well for one, you have to be not banned in order to vote xD
---

---
A lot of people seem confused that they're calling this a saga instead of a season. I'm interpreting it to mean that the Icebrood saga is going to cover the entirety of the Jormag story whereas in the past it could take multiple seasons to handle a singular threat.
---
I love capture point modes and the like, conversely, but I've always found the objectives in GW2 fairly lacking. They're too small, to the point where some AoEs can actually ecompass them completely, there's not much cover when you're actually in them, so you're something of a sitting duck in your tiny circle, and as a result, a lot of the admittedly interesting map geometry is simply never used.
---
The GW2 combat system, however, is fucking great, and even now when I only log in once in a blue moon, I love hopping on and messing with builds and things. The announcement of more interesting mini-seasons has me at least a little bit excited to enjoy the PvP in this game again.
---
I mean, FFXIV works perfectly fine on console. In fact it was designed for it to be.
---
However, the issue with GW2 is that it *wasn't* designed to be playable and consoles and the game runs like complete ass even on PCs stronger than a console.
---
Rest in peace Engineers.
---
It has always been a mix bag, I have seen extremely nice and also extremely nasty people. I wouldn't go as far as saying as we have the best community though.
---
Indeed but for most of your cast you still have to stay stationary
---
I liked the voice of Jormag ;D
---
It really sucks that most of you can't see the difference between Anet the company and the people who are actively creating the game and care about it.
---
Bye Say Hi to Bill and Ted for me!
---
I got a dye worth 130g from it. But its a color I would probably never use, so I am conflicted on whether to be happy or sad.
---
Anet had issues from start with GW2, refusing to hotfix gamebreaking pvp bugs (and still aiming to become e-sport) making a lot of people leave game early. The performance in wvwvw has never been good, with lag in big zerg fights. Neglection of pvp overall started way before layoffs.  These issues among others belong to ANet, not NCSoft
---
What game would you say have the best community then?
---
Meanwhile Gaile Gray just seems content on shutting people down.
---
Sssh! Mods are sleeping!
---
Or
---
Top- Utter idiots that accept mediocrity
---
bottom- people with an IQ that at least passes the number of fingers a human has.
---
Yes I can?
---
I love it when the roadmap is a blank piece of paper.
---
Graphics like someone said, and get rid of some loading screens if possible, and invisible walls in world :P
---
I think I read once that the reason there's no new dungeons is there was literally one guy on the team who knew how they worked, and he's gone.
---
They're definitely working on an 'interesting' base...
---
&gt;This game will outlast any other MMO without having to release a classic version
---
Mind if i ask what drugs are you using to have said this? Because it seems your drug-addled brain suggested GW2 is the only game without a classic version.
---
The funny thing is that if THAT was the narrative : after the layoffs the team was in disarray, they wouldn't know if lws 4 ending was the last episode they'd ship etc. if they would have embraced it and made it part of the announcement it would have been miles better. Hell everybody loves a "hero reborn" story.
---
If they would have presented the perspective that they were in a shit place, everything was bad and through the effort of everyone they managed to ship something at the high standard of quality the player based is expecting it would have been a different thing. They could have spun this off as not necessarily an event for the players to hype a new set of great features, but also as an event where players come together as well to see ANet experience tough times and getting over them, an event to celebrate the hard work everybody put in to get here. Have a "human" moment. 
---
But instead of leaning Into the problem Matthew mentions, they just overhyped and underdelivered without presenting things from a different perspective. Their marketing really needs an overhaul.
---
I am very damn happy. Norn needed a decent storyline since forever, the mastery involving spirits also sounds interesting. Just extremely happy that Norn finally get some love
---
I was gonna celebrate and buy some gems if the announcement went well. Been itching to get more skritt bonds, but I'll hold off for now. It's been exactly a year since the last time I gave Anet money, and now there's potentially no next time for me.
---
Sadly the silent majority doesn't even know about reddit. But they do chase after new shiny toys added to gemstore.
---
You also said your friend is getting it, who i mentioned.
---
Hard to read i see.
---
yeah, today i mostly felt like guild wars 2 was in anets control, but the more i think about the situation and contextualize it i realize i was foolish to not consider ncsoft's presence in all of the decision making. i kinda walked away from the stream feeling like my disappointment rested mainly with anet, but like, none of the devs have anything bad to say, even ex devs, about working at the company. i cant help but think ncsoft was more responsible for the bad parts of todays event more than i considered. i just hope they are letting anet do their thing with season 5, but i really want to see more information come out this week too
---
??? Carebear. 
---
Hey everyone I’m seriously disappointed in your performance but I’m still going to give you props for the most minuscule thing
---
Great spanking work, good hustle!!
---
I don’t think jobs work that way... 
---
Hey you didn’t do anything I expected you to do but you wore a GREAT shirt to the meeting today that you weren’t prepared for, I’m not going to fire you and am still interested in your services 
---
ArenaNet: Thanks!
---
&gt; But we had a system. RIP 2016-2019
---
This isn't anything new though, about the only thing that they were very clear on around the start of this year and especially as a consequence of the layoffs was that there is no expansion in development (at the time). We could have had an expansion by now? Not really, the only thing we could have had was an announcement that one was now in development and would be releasing (late) next year or something like that. But when they scoped this announcement to be about living world it was a virtual guarantee that wasn't going to happen.
---
It was advertised as a 45 min event.
---
You're stupidly putting the pieces backwards and then saying you did the puzzle.
---
ANet had near full control of the game and THEY decided to funnel resources away from GW2 more and more to focus on other random projects. They did this to the point NCSoft was forced to step in and do layoffs because of ANet's fuck-up.
---
If enough people report something on this sub, the automod will delete it and one of the mods has to manually permit it.
---
You could have googled it yourself faster than making this reddit post
---
Imagine renting a theater but announcing the most interesting and important updates through a blog post.
---
Why ?
---
Having lots of thoughts doesn't mean you suddenly can't press the enter key
---
ive been back and forth between the forums, the subreddit, and twitch as peoples takeaways from today continued to develop. your problem is... seeing my name more than once? you can just not respond and it will be as effective in your case
---
I REALLY HOPE he's just an anti-hero and they don't decide to turn him into a Garrosh.  
---
Bangar has LOTS of potential for interesting interactions with the cast, and it would be such a waste if we end up just killing him because he cares more about the treaty.  Like, i'm sorry, THERE'S A FUCKING DRAGON ON THE HORIZON, could we at least TRY to get some tense diplomacy up in here for once?  Killing every antagonistic leader who disagrees with us is not only a bit narratively juvenile, but also wholly unrealistic: If we're trying to muster allies to fight back the dragons, then why kill disagreeing factions and rely on contrived plot to save the day in the end, when we could make a tenuous alliance through our own force of personality?
---
When they said armor I was expecting things like the Tricksters and Phoenix sets, I wanted the wreathe of cooperation for a while so thanks I guess but it's still really light. Even with the glider :\\
---
I'm happy they're making merch, I'm just kinda sad I don't actually like most of it - like, have y'all seen the shirt designs? GW2 has such beautiful art, and I just don't feel like the shirt designs are strong enough to showcase that, at all...They're mostly just concept art in boxes, for the most part. Why not designs that showcase our gorgeous art and are subtle/eye-catching enough to even attract non-players? Some examples of what I mean: [Witcher Shirt] (https://www.jinx.com/p/the_witcher_3_visit_velen_premium_tee.html) | [Wow Shirt](https://www.jinx.com/p/world_of_warcraft_expansion_series_mist_of_pandaria_womens_tee.html) | [Rocket League Shirt](https://www.jinx.com/p/rocket_league_neon_cover_womens_raglan.html)
---
I've never even heard of Rocket League, but I really liked the aesthetic of their merch and looked it up...isn't that part of the goal of merch? I just want shirts that looked like they were actually *designed*.
---
As far as the Wild Bangarang collection, it just didn't scream "Guild Wars 2" to me, and wasn't very exciting overall. Maybe it just didn't translate well, idk. I have a few dresses in the style of the Eir one, but not the "cosplay" kind - mine have prints inspired by the license (LoZ and Sailor Moon, in my case) so they're quite wearable. That one hopefully looks better in person, but I could also see the cloudy/highlight area on the chest looking horrible when stretched across boobs.
---
So you expect your group to babysit and carry you?
---
Only the prologue is free lol
---
I really love the way they did Jormag's voice. The first bit sounds so butter smooth compared to the other elder dragons, but then at the end as his face comes on screen we get the processed growl most EDs seem to share more or less.
---
He gets minions by convincing them to join him. Mordy forces himself into your mind and Kralk and Zhaitan don't bother. But Jormag needs to be persuasive to get the Norn (and now the Charr!) to accept his offer of power. Perhaps the smooth voice is what he uses when he's trying to turn on the charm.
---
but it's prologue not episode 1
---
Nani?!
---
And the rest of the season is just Jormag trying to get a restraining order.
---
You specifically wrote "you're excited because you're new" that implies that I am a new player, not just my friend. So that's why I clarified :o I don't have any difficulty reading ;)
---
I actually like them.
---
The game needs more middle ground armors between the bland beginning sets and the millions-of-particle-effects-stupid-shiny-endgame gear.
---
yeah and i think ncsoft overcompensated with this announcement. i just dont believe that anet would repeatedly advertise a live event only for it to turn out the way it did by their own doing. they have made a lot of bad decisions but i dont think making the presentation not even the full 45 minutes, and then shoehorning a cringy merch section was entirely their idea, and my original takeaway from the event was that it totally was their decision.
---
&gt;your problem is... seeing my name more than once?
---
You understood THAT from me saying that having lots of thoughts won't stop you from pressing Enter in order to space your sentences?
---
Wow, you have issues.
---
Most people making these complaints know a sinking ship when they see one and are justified in their complaints
---
Well things shifted around when they replaced an expected expansion with a fifth season and also justified it by saying they could deliver expansion-worthy features with the living world.
---
I don’t call an instanced boss, a raven spirit mastery and a growing maps expansion-worthy, especially after things like the Beetle, the Skyscale or Sun’s Refuge. Perhaps the story will be more polished, but gameplay-wise nothing that was said gave that impression.
---
Yes but if they are coming later in the saga they aren't ready to be shown.
---
fuck yes for HoT. I loved PoF but HoT was phenomenal. Truly, the balance between the two would be the ultimate place for GW2. I do like the idea of strikes and the new saga sounds compelling enough for living story... I guess.
---
Sure, so long as you don't also keep those rewards *away* from other players that want them, and have no interest in that game mode. Nobody is saying "give raiders less," just "give other players alternate methods of acquiring those things." There's nothing so special about raiding that it entitles them to be the *only* ones to have Envoy armor, for example.
---
Not in the trailer, they showed a little clip of what happens in the prologue at one point.
---
I came here to say this but you phrased it much better than I ever could. OP doesn't understand that WvW is bleeding players all the time and we just want something to stop the bleeding.
---
They can barely deliver actual content and you expect them to bring back a character screen?
---
Looking at comments: Why do hardcore and casual players have to argue about what's better for the game. It's totally possible to have replayability for consistent rewards as well as decent story content (which gw2 generally does well on the latter imo). 
---
Fyi Hardcore players are NOT the people speed running the content and then calling it quits. They grind out the currencies, achievements, and new events for months until they're drained or finished. 
---
Your focuses should be on making it clear to each other that you're not actually against each other. I'm actually SO sick of this casual vs. hardcore community,  despite all the good that can come from it. Whining and blaming on both sides.  The real issue is when speed runners blast through the story and then cry and call it quits on the forums. Somehow they're being confused as the hardcore players. I feel like that's where the drama storm started from. There is NO WAY there are people that exist that actually don't want replayability of content for decent rewards. I think even casuals want that. Why does it matter if person A only wants to do a dungeon once but person B wants to get all the weapon and armor pieces from the dungeon vendor, or wants to repeat raids/ fractals for rewards. This game already has horizontal progression so just give grinders the proper rewards for their time spent instead of time gating. Also don't know why playing the game like this is generally bad and grinders are witch hunted wtf. Everyone has different life situations. Respect that. What an obvious thing. Don't insult someone that has the time or makes sacrifices to play the game more. They clearly are more dedicated to the game so it is understandable if the hardcore community is upset because anet doesn't listen to them. 
---
There should be difficulty settings for raids, with rewards set in accordance to difficulty. Everyone should be able to access the lore. I actually think that is a key issue and something anet can fix. Kind of like infant mode in Super Adventure Box. The new strike missions will be nice but not actual practice for raids. 
---
If you love this game work to understand each other. If you're new to the mmorpg genre, play some other games while you're at it and you may realize the things gw2 is good at and bad at. I've been playing mmorpgs since i was 12, starting with Runescape,  and then playing a shit ton of other ones until now. I could probably name more than 10. I can confidently say gw2 is a great game, but the hardcore community is certainly frustrated and dying. Why play a game if there's nothing else to do? Just login for daily fractals/ weekly raids and call it? That's not a game. It's a chore at that point.
---
So tacky. Im weary in genera of all the third party stuff they have been doing lately. Like the leggings thing like why?
---
It looks plain and dull.
---
People are playing mesmers in zergs as mirages commanders now. cant have that
---
Weren't half of these in the gem store the last time I looked? These aren't things which are unavailable or that have been out of rotation for a long time.
---
Greg Miller is not NCSoft and all the devs were Arenanet. But yes it was likely NCSoft.
---
Ah that makes sense. Thanks
---
I also liked the big green choya!
---
&gt;yeah and i think ncsoft overcompensated with this announcement
---
You're ignoring EVERYTHING just to continue your mentality that NCSoft is to blame, you're hopeless.
---
Quality of your work does not reflect on how much work you put in. Sure the devs worked really hard but that doesn’t mean whatever comes out of it is good enough.
---
:penisboat:
---
Not ready to be shown perhaps. Confirmed though? Surely. It would have helped the conference big time.
---
?? That's so trivial. What about boon sharing, combo fields, synergy between multiple classes and their traitlines and weapon skills... the list goes on.
---
Go and make more awkward videos. I will keep insisting. 😂
---
It wasn't overhyped though. The announcement was entirely lacking of anything of substance whatsoever. It really is baffling why they even did the announcement at all if they really had NOTHING important to show off.
---
Anet could send me a massive turd in an envelope and I'd probably enjoy it more
---
Because it the first time he's done this since becoming game director.
---
FFXIV
---
THANK ME LATER
---
You discourage your own participation, and you don't seem to get that.  Organize your posts if you don't want instant downvotes.
---
I normally hate to say this, but you could have used the gw2 wiki instead of taking a picture and making a post on reddit. Someone in game could have answered as well... unless they tell you to use wiki lol.
---
Layoffs is irrelevant. It's up to the company to put in action to ensure content is made &amp; delivered in a timely manner and ultimately is what the players are wanting/expecting since the game lives or dies on making sure the player base stays. They can layoff however many they want to save money or w/e their goal is but they need to ensure it doesn't get reflected so heavily on the game which it obviously has.
---
Yes they could have done that but they know this community if they confirm elite specs are coming and they say they were cancelled what do you think the community will do.
---
Potential future plans for competitive by anet: copy paste potential  future plans for competitive from 2 years ago. GG anet.
---
Oh I moved on long ago lol
---
We were complaining tho. It was nice to actually find out what happened to joko.
---
in regards to what im specifically talking about, which is the living world live stream that happened today, and not everything in the past few years that came before it, i dont really have proof that one side had more control over the other. do you have proof of either having more control over how this announcement would go than the other? other than using contextualization of stuff that only arenanet had been doing for their game? a live event gets more input and coordination from ncsoft, because they as a publisher have joint responsibility of overseeing live events where their ips are shown. thats part of their agreement with anet. Anet works on their game with direction from ncsoft, anet shows off their game with direction from ncsoft. i am inclined to agree that anet had full control before the layoffs, but where was that actually stated? it may feel that way, but ive never actually seen hard proof that that was the case
---
What they announced today clearly isn’t everything that is going to be coming out over the next year. They are not going to say what they have planned for episodes further down the line. I reserve judgement for when the thing actually comes out. 
---
And the overanalyzing is directed at the people picking apart every little word they said going frame by frame and analyzing it word for word instead of taking it at face value and moving on. 
---
At the end of the day this is free content that hasn’t even been released yet. Everyone will calm down and be over it by the time it releases like always, or some other drama will happen and they will forget about this.
---
Psst. Let them cry.
---
The whole saga is free
---
LOL jsksks
---
Did they hype it up as a huge announcement?
---
Or did the community just have unrealistic expectations based off of what we already know about A-Net's release plans.
---
So basically we can agree that HoT had better system of keeping the map populatee
---
Honestly. I would have loved it if they  said: "yes, people, new elite specifications are coming, but they are not ready yet". Instead, they simply left the stage.
---
I don't think they would add full set directly to the prologue though.
---
Didn't even mention fractals. Kinda sad as it's the only challenging 5 man instance content
---
I wanted Noxxi to do make one but this'll do, I guess.
---
Okay, no, for real. All I want is longbow for Necromancer.
---
There were WvW players watching this?
---
no i do get that. like entirely. there are just people with better temperaments who come to posts you deem shitty without the immediate scrutinizing eyes, and sometimes they are willing to participate. just because they dont come as frequently to disorganized posts doesnt mean it doesnt happen. you are being delusional in the idea that downvotes in a sub like this, in a time like this, make such accurate representations of the community opinion. your are making perfectly valid points, but you seem to care way more about a problem that should be taken up with the mods if it bothers you so much. i dont know what else to say. i dont have an obligation to organize my thoughts for people with low temperaments. i can do so and garner more respect that way, but like i said, im not here for anything other than opinion gathering, and your opinions are so meta relative to the content that its like, do you really not feel like youre wasting your own time yet?
---
I never had a hype balloon, so I guess I got lucky there. 
---
I expected this to be about the story only. The information we got both was more story stuff than I expected, and more non story stuff (strikes, swiss pvp nearing beta, build templates coming, hot becoming bundled with PoF, a release date)
---
I expected another 2 month wait, those 3 week wait for the prologue is perfect.
---
I'm disappointed that the leaked/datamined weapon proficiency icons didn't make an appearance, but rational thought suggests those icons are all the missing proficiency weapons, which will probably be used for the build templates UI.
---
Mainly PvP now but thats just out of a lack of PvE options. Hence my excitement at the idea of strikes and a new entry point into the lore of GW2 . 
---
What everyone claims they want can and could still be coming in future episodes. All we know about is the prolog which probably wont take us anywhere drastically new. Seasons or can last over a year, and they are unfortunately not going to give a roadmap out to explain what is coming a year from now let alone months or weeks.
---
My wife and I liked the announcement as well, and we're both playing for 7 years. We have others in our guild who liked the announcement. This fantasy that no one that plays this game plays it for the living story because you don't, really should end. There are veterans who are massively dissatisfied with this game. And there are veterans who are mad altoholics or farmers or just meta runners, who like stuff the way it's going now. It's not just new people.
---
Im very interested with your extra, its kinda impossible for me since im from ocx which also always exclude from any ANet giveaway.
---
Seriously screw the whole CoMmUniTy WiLl bE aNgRy narrative, it’s not an excuse.
---
If they reach a point of *actually* ever cancelling potential elite specs entirely, it’s because they have **really bad** production pipeline and management issues. You don’t invest resources in one of the game’s main mechanic and gameplay loop (you know, classes) to cancel it midway. Unless another layoff is inbound (doubtful), it’s a safe feature to work on. They’ve succeeded twice in a row with them after all. Elite specs are safe production bet, more than Sun’s Refuge (which was an one-time thing never-to-be-used again).
---
To put it simply: they could delay them, yes, but cancel them completely? It wouldn’t happen. Cancel mean resources were wasted. Delaying means it’s being saved.
---
Secondly, which one is worse:
---
- Confirming elite specs after the game director *actually said* we would get expansion-worthy features for the next season in the second official live showcase event of the game *but* being forced to delay them later
---
- What we got
---
I’d choose the former anytime.
---
To be fair, he was just representing the fashion sense of most GW2 players.
---
Yes, they do. For instance Kralktorrik is called Aurene's Grandfather, so he has to be male. We also now for a fact, that Aurene is a female.
---
As a story telling concept, the hero can’t keep on relying on Aurene to fight our battles whenever we want. We are the heroes and we need to be the ones making difficult choices and actions. Otherwise we could constantly be like “Hey Aurene use your new god like powers to take out this new baddie. K thnx”. I hope we do see her on rare occasions again, but I don’t want her fighting for us like she is a deus ex machina.
---
Lol. You're setting a bad example. Everything depreciates over time... expect maybe people... and gold. They didn't have to give us anything. Instead, they kinda wasted our time and their money by renting out a theater...
---
Gw2 has no sub fee. They need new players to spend gems. I have no idea where their money is going though XD.
---
You've completely missed the point. Arguing would fall on deaf ears im sure, so I won't try. /Sigh
---
WHY WONT YOU BRING FACTION INTO GUILD WARS 2 AS A NEW EXPANSION WHYYYY. 
---
I WANT TO EXPLORE LUXONS AND KURZICKS. THEY WERE MY CHILDHOOD. FUCK MAN.
---

---
You don't need expansions while leveling.  You do have the option of boosting a character to 80 and starting the early PoF missions to get the raptor mount.  You get it very early in PoF.  You can then level up your original character with the convenience of the raptor.
---
&gt; I fail to see why we can't agree that having a well detailed and updated roadmap is a good thing for any project.
---
Who disagreed with that?
---
WeirdChamp
---
watch Jim Sterlings videos and youll learn a lot about how we are basically just walking dollar signs.
---
&gt;watching this was like being the poor kid who was taken to McDonald's for their birthday. You're as happy as you realistically can be, but as you munch on your soggy fries 
---
Cheezit what McDonald's did you go to? Soggy fries???
---
Can i ask, if you went to wow rn and realised that all old expacs are included in your sub for free would you be mad for that too?
---
Do Pof users get this too? I don't see it on mine in gemstore
---
Since the mount part was covered, for the "off topic" part it is possible your topics were "auto-modded" out of existance because there were enough reports and let's just say that today.yesterday there is a bit of turmoil in this sub :p
---
You can probably ask/appeal to the mods if that happens again and you feel your thread is valid by [messagin them](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FGuildwars2).
---
Dragon stand maps are almost never dead. You need to check the LFG for a meta map. Also, make a legendary skin you actually like and will use. Don’t make one because it is easier.
---
How is this an insult? They’re referring to a guy who was cheering in the back of the audience.
---
People exaggerate the requirements for a reason. Let's say with a completely optimal split-second-timing perfect play you output 100% of what a character can do.
---
Raids actually only need about 60% of that, as long as you follow mechanics, and you'll be fine. BUT....
---
Quite a few players maybe do 10% of that, so the people who should be fine at 60% now have to try to give out 100%. The guy doing 10% while spamming 1 and dying to mechanics then calls everyone else "toxic hardcore" and that gets spread.
---
The reality is you'll probably be fine as long as you know what mechanics of the fight are, more-or-less how to pull your weight at whatever job you're doing, and have ascended gear with the proper upgrades. You don't have to be a flawless DPS-bot, but you do have to TRY and do some research first.
---
Toxicity coming from assholes from both casual and hardcore communities; in-game and forums. Tryhards vs. Snowflakes and normies actually stuck in the middle.
---
&gt;Anyone who payed any attention would have known 6 months ago that there was no plans for another expansion
---
Thats enough sir(or ma'am), you need say no more.
---
idk i'd take an expack for free over a title/glider.
---
that was probably the one announcement i liked most, means my pof-only alt accounts all have hot as of whenever...i guess? unless there's some strings i missed or w/e.
---
Oh I see your “point”. You all hyped the announcement in your minds and choose to read more into the announcement then what would be there even though the communication was clear. Complaining about how it was done. I’m seriously tired of this community and ready to quit the game because of you turds.
---
That’s my theory. Darth Vader guy at the end advertising the merch just makes me believe it even more.
---

---
It’s a long post, but I’m going to pick out something in there specifically. Something along the lines of, “People get done with content very quickly and patience is a lost virtue.”
---
I agree that people are less patient. However, I also think this is due to there being so many options. People who are complaining about lack of content, aren’t complaining because they hate the game. They’re complaining because they love it. They’re afraid that everyone will move onto the newer thing that’s cropping up every month and the game will die. And a game that’s so reliant on concurrent players to be sustainable/enjoyable. (Fairly hard to find groups for certain areas outside of peak hours or even during peak)
---
I think what they’re trying to do, is create new players over keeping old ones. Which I think is working. I started another alt yesterday. There were so many new players asking me how I got my mount and in awe in the starting zone. That’s something magical to me. They asked me loads of questions and seemed incredibly hyped to start their journey. 
---
Honestly, I think we should be patient. Especially if you’re one of the people who are scared that the game will die. Let’s help the new players get invested. However, I do agree they totally went about announcing the new season all wrong. Which I think most of the discouragement is coming from.
---
fck gw2, but atleast get her name right, Avril fkn sk8ter boi Lavigne.
---
Bro, they obviously know that an expansion would be the ultimate thing for the game and what everyone wants. That's not the issue. The issue is whether or not they actually have the resources to make one.
---
Been waiting for this
---
I look forward to Snargle's reaction to [Bangar's epic burn on Rytlock about fatherhood](https://youtu.be/U7nEC7vgY2g?t=5717), especially given Snargle's own relationship with his dad that he can reflect on. Or how Flame Legion will be attending the summit alongside other legions and how Snargle might be wondering why Bangar hasn't placed the Flame traitors' heads on spikes by then. :)
---
Given how often metas and maps directly relate and influence the story, it's highly probable that the mystery *will* be a specific part/beat in the story.
---
Showing concept art isnt new in mmos what cucked this announcement wasnt was shown, it was all the other stuff thst werent shown (like especs, and an expansion confirmation)
---
Where in this post did it say it's the fans fault for not spending enough money lol
---
If that was their goal then not a single damn one of them has even seen a screen shot of monster hunter.
---
also, xpacs have the added benefit of being a ton of content all at once, which is a big deal, especially for interesting a new part of the world. In addition, with POF at least, they are in addition to seasons, not instead of them.
---
Game forward? It depends on who uses real money. That's it
---
And I think this is just a build-up to an expansion. They need to lead the story and direction with another living story. I love this game, and hope it continues from the same amount of time it has already been going. I understand you are all upset at the livestream, but just wait and see what they give us. I'm filled with optimism that this is just the new expansion build up. I'm disappointed too, it was hyped up and was only 40 minutes long, I was expecting 2-3 hours at least. The layoffs are disconcerning too, but I'm just trying to hope man.
---
well, the more concerning interpretation from this is that they *did* say everything they have about the coming future of the game, and that's it. Season 5.
---
I cannot seem to make a new account for GW2. I try, but for some reason, all of the required boxes remain red and when I push the button, the only error is "undefined". Help?
---
Trust me gw2 is a single player game . Just bots are humans. The tp let you all p social interaction even more
---
... i dunno man, sean murry seems to be doing alright with no mans sky. Probably because h e does what the community asks. Who would have thought giving the people what they want would be so beneficial for your own company.
---
Exactly
---
I actually see that this level of annoucement was a risk taken....a calculated risky by someone REEEEEEEEEALLY BAD at math.  
---
Someone is pushing all the money to advetisement when the team has almost NOTHING to advertise. This is so, so bad. People say they never advertised as much when PoF or HoT was coming out. That was the moment tho. Now? The team should be making more humble annoucements, and invest again on that when they got a lot of stuff going on.
---
That pretty much sums up how I feel OP. Although I've only been with the franchise since launch of 2012. I think the marketing and PR department needs to seriously re-evaluate all these unfortunate missteps in recent history because like you said, it's hurting the game's potential and I'd rather not see it fade off into the sunset. 
---
I just want to know why so many things were glossed over today. 
---
Did it seriously not cross anyone's mind at ANET that it might be a good idea to explain what the difference between a Saga and Season is? 
---
Why did they choose to devote so much time showing us 3rd party merchandise and not go into more detail about these 10-man strike missions or the new world boss? 
---
They mentioned at the start of the stream they have all these new teams dedicated and re-focused on the game but remain tight-lipped on whether or not new raids and fractals are in the pipeline. I know for a fact that developers watch Mighty Teapot's stream on a weekly basis, and a major theme for a long time now has been how the raid community has no idea if there will ever be another wing. Why is that? Why keep them in the dark and risk further bleeding out the playerbase? 
---
At the end of the day, I was really looking for simple reassurance that the game won't go back into maintenance mode after the Living Story Season 5...sorry, Saga, comes to end. And after seeing how hush-hush certain things were today, I'm inclined to believe that's still a very real option and the devs oddly came across like they know that's exactly what will happen in a years time.
---
They literally said they were baby raids on the announcement.
---
He guys feel sorry for me because i made a shitty product, but also feel sorry for me because i continue to make a shitty product.
---
No matter what the context, this shit will always be tearjerkingly hilarious!
---
Assnet will always be trash.
---
They literally said this is raid like content that wont require you to optimize gear and composition. Aka stand and press 1. Infantile mode it called that because SAB is campy and satire. This is the equivalent of infantile mode.
---
Sad part is I'd like everyone to try this game because it's really fun but all the negativity is turning potential new players away.
---
I never was toxic, I just invested time trying to understand how a person with your mental limitations is actually able to survive. (Still open for suggestions btw)
---
i know for a fact that choya t shirt is gonna be in my shirt drawer asap. i will show my sis the leggings if she wants some with cool designs, dunno about the funkopop but the mini pet will really help sell it and i wouldnt mind seeing those around since mini pets are mini pets. everyone say you hate the choya shirt so i dont have to deal with it selling out too fast lol
---
As a consumer, maybe not. As a human... maybe?
---
I'm very disappointed in the announcement, and I am even more confused today than yesterday. With this said, I think it comes down to the prelude to see what differs between a normal release and the new releases.
---
This is such a stupid idea tho. The new CoD isnt out yet but I know I dont like it cause the concept is stupid.
---
FFXIV isn’t without it’s own flaws and weird practices. I’ve been playing on and off since ARR’s launch and returned for each expansion. Each time I made a brand new character to level up from scratch (total of 4), making a point to max out at least one of each role, max out my gathering jobs, and max out at least one craft. Each character was leveled organically, no boosts, each character had to do the story (no paying for skips), each character did **all** of the optional content before moving onto the next patch and then onto the next expansion, leading to the current endgame. Each character got a full set of the highest item level gear available at the time period in which they were being played and was maintained up until my next hiatus.
---
All in all it’s a solid game, some things about it are kinda shitty, like how if you want more bank space you have to pay for it monthly, on top of your subscription fee, or the fact that a lot of the story is delivered through a fucking novel that if you didn’t skip by clicking through, would literally take an hour or more to read at times. As far as gameplay goes, combat is kind of mindless at times, once you hit a certain item level, the only thing that’s challenging is the latest content.
---
If you’re really into repeating dungeons and raids every single day and always playing “keep up” or “catch-up” with your gear, and having gear you worked really hard for become useless for the latest high end content every few months and having to grind for more. (Nothing wrong with that if you do.) then FFXIV is definitely for you. 
---
Unfortunately what eventually drove me to quit was an overwhelming lack of purpose and an overwhelming sense of boredom. I eventually hit a point where I was only logging in to do my weeklies and dailies, and then logging out because that’s all there really is to do and nobody’s really social the same way they were in ARR so if I wasn’t queuing for something, chances were I was standing around in silence.
---
... 
---
I returned to GW2 a couple months ago, I used my same account from 4 years ago (played pre-expansion and then went on a 4 year hiatus while I was playing games like FFXIV.) but decided to start a brand new character and level up from scratch (no 80 boost.) so the only real added benefit I had was a higher magicfind stat and a stockpile of old mats. I never really got any crazy skins or anything before because I only bought and played the game a while to appease somebody who said I **had to** try it back in the day. My map completion on the old character was even pitiful, I basically cleared the story and then quit back then.
---
It wasn’t long before I hit lv 80 but through leveling up normally, I discovered why exactly GW2 is still one of the top MMOs on the market, the social aspects of the game are strong, people are still doing events in old zones, people are using map chat, people are hanging out at hub towns just talking or showing off their stuff, or playing their instruments for crowds. The world feels so alive compared to other games, especially FFXIV, which feels very dead in comparison. 
---
I got really into the PVP scene for a season and that was a pretty wild ride, unlocked a few armor skins in the process, got my first ascended accessories, made myself an ascended backpack, bought an ascended weapon. 
---
Dabbled in fractals, made hella gold. 
---
Fast forward to now and I’ve done all of the base story, I did all of season 2, I dipped my toes into heart of thorns just to get my glider and a bunch of hero points, maxed out my elite specs. I’ve completed PoF all the way up to dragon fall, I’ve done a few raids, I’ve got a complete set of ascended gear, no more exotics, saved up enough gold to just buy a year one legendary for my main weapon. I’ve unlocked every mount except for the skyscale, which I’m currently working on (and enjoying by the way, I’m glad I didn’t do it on release so the timegate isn’t way too awful and has given me time to farm map currency in between waiting.)
---
I’m also just beginning to dabble in WvW.
---
You know what hasn’t happened yet? I haven’t been so bored with nothing to really do that I quit. That’s also in part because it’s a very social game, I’ve been interacting with people and so when things do get slow, I’ve been shooting the shit with strangers, hanging out and goofing off in town, getting on my Mesmer alt to help people with jump puzzles because I enjoy them and understand that not everybody does and they want a portal. You know what I’ll be doing after I have my skyscale? I’ll go back and actually do heart of thorns. And when I’m done with that I’ll work on getting all my mastery points. And when I’m done with that guess what! **There are new maps (and map expansions) coming out with content I haven’t done yet** for free. 
---
...
---
There may come a day when I’m bored with GW2 and start looking for another MMO to play, but right now, it’s the only MMO that hasn’t bored me to death with a tedious endgame gear race of sorts. Looking at you FFXIV and WoW Specifically.
---
Pretty much this, honestly all gw2 needed to be was gw1 but better, take the things that made it great polish them up and make a better game. You can then add your lw story, your world bosses and w/e else. 
---
The gw2 foundation is just inferior.
---
Exactly XD
---
&gt; They got themselves hyped over content that was never on the table
---
Or you know, we got hyped by all the noise and marketing Anet made for this **out of ordinary** conference (last one they did was HoT in 2015).
---
The announcement was disappointing....no matter how you look at it...
---
There will always be bugs in every game, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t add more stuff.
---
He's right. Players wanted more endgame content and easier way to get into raids. Strike missions are the next step
---
oh so it works from any source, thanks!
---
Its basically what eso did with C H A P T E R S instead of expansion.
---
I hope to god Anet see the disappointment of the announcement. Which can I say people are annoyed about the announcement and not the content involved and next week they hold an AMA or a special guild chat with Z and each team lead telling us about whats planned for the saga because I do believe that there are bigger things post episode 2.
---
Diversifying is totally the way to not fully burning out of a game. Doing a bit fo GW2 and a bit of something else will make the GW2 time not look like a chore. And yes it sucks that it is coming to this for some people but honestly just come when you know you're gonna come to do stuff you enjoy.
---
As in many multiplayer games who you play with is also plays a big part on staying motivated. I recently started some raid group with a mix of beginner and semi-exp friends so that some could discover raid alltogether and the rest get better and see the harder bosses. We raid 3 times a week. I also log-in whenever people wanan do fractals (because I have the vague objective of maybe getting to Fractal God at some point). Apart from that I do other things. Finding that other thing may be a non-simple task depending on what you like though :p
---
I bet someone at ArenaNet is kicking themselves they didn't think of that.
---
I really like the wreath... which is why I already own it.
---
ITT: "These are such crappy skins. Also I bought them all already"
---
I can understand asking in game. It's quick and easy, and helpful people might be inclined to answer. I typically don't like when people in game only respond with "just Google it." In this scenario, however, it literally would have been quicker and less work to use the wiki or Google.
---
I'm sorry but, did anyone seriously expect them to talk about an expansion when they outright told us we were going right into season 5?
---
&gt; If each player who can afford paying at least $10 a month or more to get gems and buying whatever they want from GEM Store, please do so
---
How about instead of gambling our money on the gemstore in hopes for uncommon content updates we actually keep our money and ask them to sell us content worth paying for?
---
Why would you buy those ugly bandit skins? Or the masks... The mordrem ones at least were part of the HoT pre-event, but actually spending gems to collect all of these surprises me.
---
&gt; Most Veterans have already unlocked them all 
---
Bullshit
---
OP is talking about the prologue, will premier September 17. Not season 5 in general.
---
FFXIV and ESO for starers. FFXIV supports mouse and keyboard which is easy enough to implement on today's consoles.
---
I just noticed i also didn't get one. And i signed up for the thing the day they announced it.
---
That's what happens when you get on a hype train.
---
I used to have a guild mate who would come in at *every* new content drop, and immediately ask how to complete it. I took a lot of flak from my guild for telling him to "look up dulfy's guide." Apparently he couldn't be assed to do any research and it was my job to retype entire guides worth of information at his leisure.
---
I don't even play Warframe, and I still know about Warframe's development progression, and I know exactly who Rebecca Ford is.
---
Be Polite.. Im just saying haha
---
You’re such a joke lol.
---
The joke is all you whiny ungrateful losers.
---
Yeah, my bad. I wiki'ed it, and this actually means "story" and comes exclusively from Nordic lore. I see why they picked this for Norn related LS, yet I am wondering if change of name will stay as we move on form Norns to something else later.
---
Yet you can barely utilize gw2 superior combat system.. Take the fight against kralkatorik as an example.
---
Yeah I'm not going to assume anything until it actually makes landfall. Are you based in the Miami area?
---
Also, there's an inside "joke" on the warframe community back when I used to play.
---
"They don't play their games". And at times they prove it.
---
Problem is the community being in an uproar is damaging the game’s reputation far worse than what the presentation will bring in. If they just gave us some gameplay details and cut down on the story talk then the free HoT would’ve been enough to draw people in and the community would welcome them with open arms.
---
Pvp got screwed (though not as hard as wvw) but this post is stupid af
---
So now im really confused... Are you telling me Anet rented a Pax theater just to announce something they already announced **6 months ago**? yikes, im worried...
---
&gt;Nani
---
Jormag: "IT'S NOT LIKE WANT TO CORRUPT YOU BECAUSE I LIKE YOU! BAKA!!!
---
In my country we have a phrase that goes "yeah nah", good luck figuring that one out.
---
I’ve played both since launch. It’s fine if you don’t feel the same. But many people do. I’m done, and I’ve earned the right to express that.
---
The problem here is not "I don't play pvp", it's "Of all the things to be upset about, this harmless joke from someone who doesn't even work at anet and clearly wasn't what OP was characterizing it as is not one of them".
---
Wallet voting doesn't work, the game is basically a giant new player grinder, get them in, get them to spend some amount of money, move to next new player, repeat. There's this false notion that GW2 has a community of some kind, but scratch its surface and you see that the vast majority of the masses are not the same people over time, they're constantly shifting
---
By the time you spend real money just once, they're done with you, they don't need you to stick around anymore. They'd like you to stick around and spend more money, but it's easier to just grab a new player instead because they have nothing and are thus more likely to want something as well as have the money for it, but you already bought that thing you want and are less likely to want something else, and/or less able to buy it now because you spent some of your money
---
The only way to actually get the financial attention of ArenaNet would be to somehow cut off the flow of new players, but you can't
---
I get that things depreciate with time, but they are Rewarding new players and forgetting about those that have been around
---
It was decent. I was taking the day for PAX anyway and got to meet up with some semi-local guildies so I don't regret going at all.
---
LOL, was that the weird dude in the druid cape?
---
Absolutely agreed. I've been very critical about the announcement (attended in-person with guildies), but it is appropriate to say that the trailer and extra story scene both looked fantastic.
---
I do very much want this game to succeed, and it's nice to have one distinctly positive thing to say.
---
But they announced similar feature coming as regular out of festival thing, and established players are not content...?
---
Buy some on tp, it's a lot cheaper. For rare I found some "tropical" food which was about 1 silver I think and for exotic it's basically any lv 80 food (trays and feasts give 10x the extract).
---
Yep, just gotta wait a while to get it. Some ppl have it for many hours now, some dont, including me :s mi sad, gimme fwee stuffz
---

---
It's all I'm saying.
---
Yesterday on their expansion(s) shop page there was a tooltip that appeared when you moused on the box saying it gives access to core game, both expansions, currently existing living stories AND ALL UPCOMING LIVING STORIES when they hit. 
---
It sounds like they moved to seasons entirely, without expansions.
---
Well as someone who is mostly busy with life and can only play 2 hrs max per day, this announcement was pretty much what I expected. I am neither disappointed nor hyped.
---
I do feel sympathetic to the hardcore players who have maxed all 9 classes and completed all their goals. I can see how this countdown and announcement can be a huge letdown to them.

However, most people in this subreddit seem to have forgotten that this game at its core is meant for the casuals. It is extremely easy to get to max level and to get the highest tier weapons and armors relative to other mmos. This game was advertised to be casual-friendly with a lack of a subscription fee. 
---
If I was them, I would not invest so much time and energy into only this single game because I know I would be disappointed. I'm not suggesting completely jumping ship for another mmo, but maybe it is better to treat GW2 as a side game if you are a hardcore gamer.
---
[This image](https://i.imgur.com/deg8Tdl.png) gives a good visual representation of the earlier content droughts around HoT
---
Giving ANet as much credit as possible, we have not had a drought at all since LWS3 began. I am not factoring in delays, shit hits the fan sometimes and I get that. As for the productivity, because of our lack of information right now I have to make a number of assumptions as stated.
---
There are 1 person in each team. 2 of them are just drinking coffee all day, 1 is sick, and then there's Steve the potted plant.
---
Steve is in charge of WvW, PvP, and raids.
---
Steve must be the Choya inspirtion
---
The announcement was more living world but better story and content in these episodes, also a bit of "hey new players join us". I don't mind, obviously they will put elite specs and other things players are willing to pay for behind a pay wall (expansion) later. Living world is however not veteran content, but people expected it to be.
---
&gt; development will never keep up with dedicated players. It's impossible. 
---
That's true but it's also not what is happening here (or at least not exclusively).
---
depending on how things go, I'm considering it. At least I know the series will have long term stability.
---
gemstore stuff.
---
Interesting
---
Thing is, presentation was planned almost year ago, way back before layoffs. Now I think that they wanted to show some unannounced projects that were cancelled.
---
RIP dual pistol mesmer, it will never happen :(
---
this announcement was supposed to be the redemption, they announced it a month in advance, rented out a theater and put on a 48 hour long cooldown like something massive was going to happen, it's too late for redemption now
---
It suffers from some of the same problems as GW2, mainly PvE leveling is easy and mindless. 
---
But Cyrodill is everything WvW should have been in GW2, I'm having tons of fun. 
---
Funny thing is, I got ESO after getting back into GW2 for the second time, and exactly like the first time, I leveled a char to 80 and lost all desire to play it.
---
Community already did build templates long ago... They are called build templates and are tied to arc dps. They will not be supported further, since anet wants to do their own, but they've been around for a long time..
---
Content creators are the lifeblood of modern games. If you really don’t understand why then I hope you enjoy the empty lobby that will be lion’s arch in a few years.
---
I love the screenshot he used for the video. Its like he is saying The Future is...dead!
---
im a hardcore player who plays 6 hours a week. its not gameplay time, it's skill and challenge based.
---
Yes. Finally you understood. Its not. It will never be. 
---
You are asking for "If I paid you x-dollar 5 years ago, I want to keep getting free stuff for next 10 years". When you bought HoT, the promise was only for HoT features. That's all.
---
What Anet is saying "if you support us now by buying latest xpac, or supported us recently, we will give u our old stuff free. If you already have old stuff, here is a tee shirt. Thanks."
---
If you type /wiki in your chat box and then shift click on item or skin the game opens up the wiki page for it.
---
it's ascended cooking, not legendary. but yes, they definitely should've kept that and announced it yesterday. would've still been a blow but might have softened the mood slightly. one part of the job of the marketing team is managing expectations of their customers. they clearly have no idea how to do that part and it seriously backfired.
---
Yeah, the GTX1050 deffo isn't the bottleneck, it's the i7-8650u. As this is a postprocessing filter (or well, realtime I guess), the upside is that if you lower the resolution it frees up some CPU-time in the pipeline, which in both theory and practice result in better frame rates. The sharpening the adds tidies things up.
---
I took a bunch of screenshots now to show how it looked, but realised that the in game capture tool doesn't capture the filter &gt;&lt;
---
There was never going to be an expansion announcement. It was always LS5 
---
They said no expansion pack. Why hype yourself up?
---
1. Homes offer 0 gameplay.
---
2. Bestiary offers a chore for three days and then people would be done with it just for the sake of doing it.
---
3. No real content.
---
This is the problem why GW2 has come to the point where it is now. Shitty content and more gemstore stuff. People need quality content and will pay for it. IF you can upkeep the deliverance of it, then you can add QoL and lore stuff to it but cant base your game around it.
---
&gt; I didn't see the announcement
---
so go and watch it instead of complaining
---
It depends if they moved on to GW3 or completely new game or back to GW1 or what.
---
I don't even know that timelines matter right now.  We have burning questions like:
---
\- Will there ever be another raid?
---
\- Will there ever be new elite specs?
---
\- Will there ever be another expansion?
---
You know, stuff like are they planning to do anything major with the game ever again, or is the future a living story chapter every 4 months until enough players quit that it isn't even worth supporting that anymore?
---
Hoping for an expansion is probably the worst thing to do right now. This announcement was supposed to be a way for anet to display their strengths, and it was an absolute failure. There is nothing consistent for veteran/hardcore players to expect for the upcoming year, year and a half, at the very least
---
Didn't see until now...
---
Well, as you said, the whole point is to kill all the elder dragons.
---
Don't really need to rent out a theater to announce we're killing another elder dragon in that case.
---
Someone who was told to wear a Goth Dress to a Launch Announcement.
---
I get where he comes from and huge kudos to the team for not breaking down after what happened.
---
They work a job though and the goal of the company is to earn money, what we consumers seek is to consume a product and when there is no product to consume, consumers will leave.
---
I get that he didn't like us being dissapointed, but he is not seeing this from our perspective either. They did hype this announcement for a while and with hype comes expectations (often unreachable ones to be fair) anyway the team wanted this to be big and to get the community "rallied". The problem that came with this is that they had nothing, well they had the living story, but i think we all can agree that the living story could just be announced during a blogpost? I can only speak for myself when it comes to living story and i really don't play it because i never catched me.
---
Tl;Dr i get what hes trying to say, but he seems biased towards the devs side and seems to forget that they are running a game to earn money and not praise for keeping a consistent living story schedule
---
There was a period of time where I was having so much fun with sPvP, despite its flaws, that I'd hop on for that exclusively.
---
All they'd have to do to keep a player like me hooked, again, is make it less broken. Wouldn't even need to make new content, necessarily...
---
We already had the trailer????
---
It's on life support, and that OFF switch is starting to look enticing.
---
Once again, look at TESO and how they milk homes. Players are actively asking for new ones and hyped whenever something comes out.
---
I think children’s work is for bitten by law. :)))
---
Lets not forget the: I wanted to wear leggings, but they didn't have my size. Which, well, was probably the best part of the segment. Imagine if he had worn some of the clothes....
---
ESO is an absolute model of how MMO developers should handle content creation.
---
Yeah it's got lootboxes - and they're a bit obnoxious, but the way and the regularity that they push out content that can be engaged with for quite a while past its release is great.
---
If it weren't for the clunky-feeling combat, I'd absolutely sink some time into it.
---
So.. AN is now a small indie company?
---
You're on the [register page](https://account.arena.net/register?alt=gw2)? How far do you get in entering info?
---
yeah, as if the living world episodes were so stellar and ground breaking before the layoffs right, they are just as bad now if not worse
---
when I first saw him I immediately thought: CAPES! 
---
at that point I was seriously ready for any kind of hype, even about something I don't even really care about like capes, I was just desperate for anything tangible. his attire was so nonsensical, I thought I had to be a teaser in itself. then he started shilling shitty merch for 10 minutes.
---
I wish I'd never heard about the announcement and hadn't seen it until the blogpost. would've felt much better than now.
---
In the past AMAs they only answered fluff questions...
---
Imagine being so negative about anything without even seeing what it will actually be. 
---
But well, Reddit is a Hivemind that loves to complain.
---
Well, you can still spend money on the game in gem store if you like to support AN.
---
Its easy content, so they are going the absolutely right way. What they are doing WRONG is that there are no NEW raids coming xd
---
Combat system means jack shit without content that forces you to use it.
---
Real discussion that will be deleted when mods wake up?
---
I don't know how it works where arenanet is, but generally I do not think employment law let's you terminate long-term employees because they are the most inconvenient to you.
---
The forums are a bunch of Yes-Men not silenced by some fanboy hobby moderators
---
As a studio you deserved it. You underperformed, didnt deliver what you were paid to do, driven the game into ruin. Now we should have some sympathy?
---
When I do a major fuck up and I dont perform I hear it from my boss and I know I wont get called for another job if it persist. So welcome to the real world where you actually have to do something to get praised.
---
I completely agree with what he is saying but why would they prepare and event like that with relentless posts and tweets of how exciting it will and discover all the new things they're preparing for season 5 ? If I hype someone up for something they love and barely talk about anything that is to come, it's on me, not on them
---
so GGG(path of exile developers) and Digital Extremes(warframe developers) are known as 2 of the best developers for just being open with their community and talk quite often on podcasts or on their own streams.
---
heck quite often if something messes up or didnt quite go as planned you have Chris Wilson the CEO of GGG actually on reddit answering questions and explaining what happened. He has a whole company to run but is willing to spend some time saying "look guys it didnt go as planned this is what fucked up" and usually goes into some detail over it.
---
Is it the bargaining phase?
---
From the original game release? Because Jeremy Soule insisted on an exclusive distribution deal, and his execution on that was complete crap. Pretty much everything that wasn't his is available (for free) on SoundCloud and other vendors.
---
While I get Matt's point about the announcement.  WvW players have been waiting long before the layoffs for some love from the devs, but they continue to keep pushing heavy on the PvE focused content.  I appreciate the recent WvW events we've had, but come on.  I would rather this game be more focused around WvW and getting to the point of having it mean something to play the game mode, than them spend the time working on an episode that casual players are only going to play for 2 hours and go back to their other game they were playing.
---
What is your favourite Quaggan?
---
You can't sub to Anet's twitch channel.
---
Do you have a gw1 account by any chance? I had the same problem and had to contact support.
---
Holy shit! What a fucking decent gamer. +1
---
Didn't see the announced stuff, but I can't stand the game engine anymore anyway.
---
The main difference between DE and ArenaNet is one has embraced twitch and the other is afraid of it.
---
DE has engaging content on twitch, with impact on in game play. If I watch Prime Time stream I can get the most recent "dlc" free just for watching. Yes the likelihood is low, but it's still there. There are also decent events just after Prime Time, that give a lot of currency and some important items for maxing your power. There are also twitch drops which encourage people to play the game and watch others play it, which makes it more visible on twitch and so more likely to get new players.
---
ArenaNet on the other hand bans you from chat for posting frogs and saying senpai. A lot of ArenaNet's streams look into the past, not the future. It's always looking at previous episodes, not the future ones. When there are Devs playing the game, they seem really out of touch and it's painful to watch at times
---
You missed: "We now focus mainly on the idea of strikes as instanced 10 man content and abbandon the idea of raids completly."
---
At the end of the day YOUR opinion matters since you are the one buying the product. Simple as that. Its self explanatory that command had to have come from NCSoft  to slap Anet on the cheeks to refocus and start doing their shit again.
---
Its the acceptance phase, we skipped bargaining and stage 4.
---
I quit this game in like late 2016 due to... complicated personal reasons.   Saw it trending and I guess for nostalgia reasons...
---
 Did they ever make world bosses like the three Headed Wurm challenging again?  When I briefly did a few of them they seemed to go super easy due to the mounts and what not.  I led a time zone in TTS before quitting the numbers started dwindling and the way to keep people was to be entertaining and try to have a relaxed environment.  I was hoping after Teq that we would see more improvements to world bosses to make them more difficult and require coordination.  Then after Shatterer that hope kind of died when it was made only slightly more difficult.
---
 I always loved this game.   Hope it’s doing well.  I guess some announcements weren’t good though.
---
Compare this to the HoT announcement event, from 2015, which was actually exciting, with elite specs, etc.  Nothing in today's announcement makes me want to prioritize returning to the game.
---
\&gt; Change my mind  
---
Meh. Think for yourself, champ. Good luck on forums, have fun seeing "kitten" used a lot.
---
They are literally saying/repeating what we already know and you feel now satisfied? Are you kidding me?
---
FF XIV is lore rich and hardcore gamers friendly. A good MMORPG game can and should have both
---
I do care about the game. But that doesn't mean I think that stuff other people want is stuff I believe is best for the game personally. I thought introducing raids was a mistake before raids were introduced, and said so. I was critical of raids being introduced.
---
Let's not pretend the critical community is critical with one voice. I remember people not wanting mounts in the game. They complained when mounts were first announced and fought against mounts every time they were mentioned...but mounts ended up being very well received, more so than anyone expected.
---
A critical community doesn't necessarily guarantee a quality game.  Obviously we should criticize what we don't like. But then,. if you like something you shouldn't bash it, just because some people will take you more seriously if you're critical.
---
People who like this game and the direction it's going are called shills, mindless, blind fan bois. Apparently only negative people should be taken seriously. This is a double standard that hampers any honest, valuable discourse here.
---
I played back in beta, played pre-launch day because preorders could start earlier (however, only possible to play every other hour). Had longer breaks over the years though, but bought all expansions + items in cash shop.  I have posted here today but not on official forum. Are you yourself a f2p troll player autosurfing or why do you choose reddit yourself?
---
We need dev diaries.  Show us what's going well.  Show us what's not going well and might be scrapped.  Talk to us like we're your clients, not your children.
---
actually i doubt it is fully staffed. i honestly think that overall the dev team for GW2 is tiny and 99% of the dev team is actually doing other stuff for NCSOFT but they dont want to admit the game is dead and running on barebones just to keep some income on it.
---
i think its been this way since PoF was finished and would explain why since then development has slowed down massively.
---
Think they didnt struggle but were rather fucking about and loosing time on some useless shit, just like they usually do. Luckily for us NCSoft noticed and pressed the soft reset button, but sometimes I feel they should go for the hard reset and change 95% of Anet.
---
That was and still is sort of my thought of it, but the 2 devs spoke as if it's not just called a saga but that ls seasons have evolved/changed into a new interation that are they are calling sagas. If I'm wrong and it's still just like a ls season with 6 episodes and they are just giving the season a name then fair enough, I've interpreted wrongly and that's on me.
---
Attention GW2 players! I got my free HoT just 5 minutes ago. It seems they don't wait for next week to gift HoT to PoF clients.
---
He was probably so nervous about saying it the wrong way, that he said it the wrong way. Unlucky to do it on an announcement like this, tho
---
Honestly, I'm surprised you didn't get voted into oblivion. This game used to have the friendliest community ever, but now now I feel if you happen to mention you enjoy the game you get shit on.
---
&gt; Did they ever make world bosses like the three Headed Wurm challenging again?
---
Sadly not. All the big "Open World Raid - Communitys" split up and are non existent anymore. All worldbosses (including TT) can now be done by an auto-atacking mob of soldier's equiped players.
---
And again you focus on only one thing completly out of context instead of my whole argument.
---
Talking to you seems to be useless so i will let this rest.
---
the proposed balance changes for wvw is something we didnt know before, did you even read the posts before commenting/complaining?
---
All they had to do was release a trailer and a blog spot for the new season. They decided to hype the whole thing by live streaming it in a whole theater (which costed a lot of money I bet) and now they're simply paying the consequences of their decisions.
---
Nobody is saying that the content is shit, we just expected something more considering all the hype ANet themselves did.
---
You shouldn't have a 44 hour countdown just so you can talk pve &amp; sell merch and then put the pvp/wvw stuff on a forum post. Too little too late, im outta here :D
---
They never said the content teams were ls, they just said they have 4 content teams, but we don't know if all 4 teams are working on ls or if fracs/raid team is considered its own team or one of the content teams, they were extremely vague and getting answers to these sorts of questions might help put some people at ease.
---
I mean..I only played WvW for the first few years, and back then WvW was definitely bleak in terms of content (and it still is). Combat adds quite a lot to a game for those that seek that.
---
This subreddit has gone downhill.
---
You mean "press 1"  "press 1"  "press 1"  "press 1" "press 1"....until he dies?
---
you serious? if you do even a little bit of WvW or PvP you would know that these "Changes" are something we wait for.
---
Coulda said its coming in  a year or something. Like we knew PoF was coming 2 years before.
---
Another option was to tease expansion related content like elites specs. 
---
Also there wasn't really unknown upcoming content. This wasn't "announcement", this was "info" stream.
---
Well you had like 5/33000 chance or so if you watched the official stream when typing!&lt;some text here&gt; when they call it
---
Incompetent developers kill games, not people who play the game. Mcdonalds selling burgers, not actually making burgers would quickly loose bussines.
---
We owe Anet nothing and they owe us everything, we are the ones paying for their salaries. We went out of our skins to give them feedback and they ignored us. Fine, we'll take our money elsewhere.
---
When you say fine do it. Its starting to happen, guess why NCSoft had to get involved, because there isnt enough of you casual plebs to even keep this game on life support.
---
&gt; People say they never advertised as much when PoF or HoT was coming out.
---
Which didnt change the fact that people complained about the lack of content being shipped with the expac launches, be it missing legendary armor from the start of PoF or a new raid with PoF.
---
My brother has been extolling the virtues of FFXIV to me for at least a year.   I think I need to try, when I have a bit more time!
---
That's what happens when you don't give the MC a love interest for 7 years. One gets Pent up.
---
Except final fantasy completely skipped the pvp part :(
---
an awesome idea, have an upvote. does your program self update?
---
alas as you cant support hook yet i will skip this as i am not willing to give it up. the chainload is a mess and it took me a while to get mine working, along with a multibox program to flax farm with alts
---
if you can get every addon running, i will love your program.
---
Completely guessing here but saga to me means an open ended story that will last as long as it needs to. At least that’s what I am hoping cuz if it’s just 6 episodes again then they are trying to con us.
---
&gt; if even a dedicated fan such as myself can't convince close friends to stay/join, that future will this game have?
---
ive played mmos since the days when muds were around. this game is moving towards maintenance mode.

I just bought a key from DLgamer. It does unlock both POF and HOT. However it only give me one level 80 boost and one share slot.  :(
---
All I want is a timeline that more locked in than "this generality will be be here eventually  (tm)"
---
No it's not been six months it's been 2 years. They promise after the HoT draught that they will keep to 1 living world season and then 1 expansion. They do it once and next thing we know they already fliped this plan over and go for an additional season back to back. Yeah that's what people want...Not only that season 4 was delayed over and over again making it take forever to finally finish. 
---
Legendary weapons needed 2 extra years to all come out. They were promised with HoT. They promised WvW restucturing long before they promised alliances and nothing ever happend. They promised quicker raid releases and what we got is even longer ones. It's just that Anet let us down so many times before the layoffs and then starts a big countdown on an announcement in a theater. 
---
I didn't expect much to be done but atleast exciting info. Their froum post yesterday had more exciting info about competivie modes than they announcement yesterday. Even worse they tell us yeah here is this boss for season 2 he is in early concept art. You guys supposely told us you had 1 team working for 2 years not on living story 4 and this is what you got? No you lied again and had nothing in the back working atleast not on gw2. It just sucks.
---
I've been playing since launch, but I too am a filthy casual. Mostly nowadays I just hop on and play solo content, myself.
---
Wow..,..  😏
---
&gt;business model
---
Thats the problem. The business model isnt Anet selling expacs anymore. They proved that today by saying the are pushing this living world/Saga model forward and not doing another expac. With the current business model of selling items in the gem store (esp mounts), wouldnt you think they would make MORE money if MORE people had access to what was being sold?
---
if todays announcement from Anet was  "thanks to EVERYONE who purchased ANY expac, you now have BOTH unlocked for free"  Doesnt that seem more logical and fair? Way more inclusive and community building. Instead, im getting a tshirt and a new player is getting a whole expac...
---
this is future, anet needs every $2.5 they can get
---
Honestly, if we can get a follow up blog post or announcement from the game director at least addressing the concerns that have been popping up, I would be happy.
---
lol
---
I obviously watched full screen and didn't notice the chat, while playing gw2.
---
I mean, for absolutely everything in life, it is baseline that there will always be someone complaining about something. The problem is when it is harder to find someone NOT complaining.
---
I don't know, we had more queues this reset than we've had in a while. Sure, people were a little disappointed, but it wasn't all "I'm GonNa qUiT thE GaMe nOw beCaUsE tHe AnNouNcEmeNT tHat wE've kNoWn iS AbOUt LiViNG sToRy diDn'T CaTeR tO My NeEDs".
---
Seriously, people hyped themselves up too much, imagining they will announce things that will never really be announceded or talked about much in a new LS announcement. 
---
I won't say no to more communication and roadmaps, though.
---
Yea, E-sport was always the focus before and when game launched. And the pvp community was quite big at first. I remember people crying that GW2 was suppose to be a pvp game and me and my friends thought: finally!
---
However, the pvp neglection started early. My first memory was the guardian block bug that lasted for months and ANet refused to hotfix. When finally the patch with a fix came they introduced another gamebreaking guardian bug. This together with other inbalances (for example heartseeker thieves, and then backstab thieves) made me and my friends leave spvp. And we were not the only ones, the competitive scene lost players one by one after that. I think that the spvp and e-sport was dead even before HoT launched. It was a shame, and wasted potential.
---
I've been scrolling through a sea of disappointment in this thread and I feel dissatisfied in the communities comments. 
---
It's not that what they're working on isn't good, isn't quality. It's that you didn't expect it. You had higher expectations for a content based team and when they have delivered content in a form you didn't expect, you treat it like it's worthless.
---
The effort these people have made is real, please I just hope some people can acknowledge that.
---
The management, the directors and producers, the overall game vision and direction is the problem. I definitely am not saying you have to like the lack of quality of life, or actual meaningful game mechanics improvements. Critique as much as you need but...
---
Please don't attack the writers, artists, engineers and quality teams who have been working on what they're directed to.
---
They didn't give out any level tomes for 7th birthday presents. You think they'd give out 800 gems to everyone who already owned HoT for free?
---
Honestly, I would love to see some new dungeons and raids. I don't get to do them often (I have a crippling fear of PUGs, and my guild only does that stuff on a day I'm unavailable), but really love the content. Normally in an MMO that's my bread and butter, but I've had some really bad experiences in LFG in GW2...
---
Anyways, I do agree that we could see some more content for the less casual players, and my hope is that they'll mix it into the new areas somehow.
---
5 (very satisfied)
---
there are a bunch of twitter people who are partners with gw2 who are giving away a small amount of aurene shirts if you follow/retweet them. draws close 7/9
---
Correct. If you wear the outfit it's all or nothing. You can hide the outfit's helm but you cannot change it for anything else.
---
Donno who reaper was but a quick Google search shows iflynn still making several videos as of this past month.
---
Warframe is at a point where content bloat is nuts for any new player showing up. I think they're trying to slowly evolve the game into something a bit more episodic with major story/content features to appeal to a wider audience, but the path to get there is long. More story-driven stuff to take those toys to.
---
The thing is that back in the day most of the updates were just copy-paste stat weapons where you just picked the strongest and ignored the rest. Getting new weapons all the time meant more new carrots to chase, but a lot of them felt redundant. They've been experimenting more and more with unique mechanics which is neat (though often the gimmicks are useless). I think stuff like Nightwave are an overall positive improvement for the game, though yeah it sucks to see how slow they are to move on certain things.
---
I like that they're putting more of an emphasis on quality over quantity and learning from past mistakes (newer boss designs are much better than rng invuln phases). It's just frustrating that things always seem to be a buggy mess and if I'm honest the story is usually laughable and inconsistent / isolated islands of content.
---
I haven't even played to start up the new stuff from this week and I haven't checked baro either. I probably will do the latter but who knows when I'll bother with the former. I burned out and need a break from it again. Just like GW2 though it's pretty easy to take a break and come back later though!
---
Everyone lusting after Bangar when the trailer gave us a perfectly serviceable husband in the first few seconds
---
Lol fuck off. I'm sorry for the devs, but why hype it up this much then? There's no way they didn't know this would raise expectations to a level they cannot meet with what they have to announce.
---
Was it actually Jormag? I thought it was Drakkar
---
I do agree, a little bit of a "Hey, we're planning on releasing a new raid in X months, as long as there's not complications" would be really nice. Some transparency about their plans, especially since they're such a small team nowadays, would go a LONG way towards improving PR and helping players feel just generally less frustrated.
---
I'm part of only two MMO communities, this and Path of Exile's community, and the PoE devs are fairly open about what's being worked on, and what's incoming, and the community loves virtually anything the Devs say because of it. I really think the GW2 Devs could pick up a few pointers from taking a look over there.
---
A post from a long time ago said that multiple teams were vying for the wizards tower, I think the raid team got dibs but that's up in the air at the moment
---
This has to be /s. Right? No way he meant that
---
This is so important. To work on something and really care about it, you put a piece of yourself into it. When it is rejected en masse because it wasn't what the public expected... 
---
I can just imagine the amount of alcohol being consumed to help ease the hurt.
---
Yes, I have tried GW2 on basic, cheap controller, and it works just fine, but I had a keyboard nearby because the controller does not have enough buttons. Even did one T4 Fractal and many dungeon paths successfully with it!
---
Loved this. It's like an EotN cutscene but made for GW2. Bangar's smirk after he gets punched is spot on.
---
&gt;It's an economical/business decision, not an emotional decision
---
Anet is moving AWAY from the expac business model and going full living world/Saga and gem store purchases. Since this is the case, wouldnt you WANT the player base to have access to the items (mounts) on the gem store that cost/make the most money. Thats the logical conclusion
---
I am "thinking like Anet", thats why the giant middle finger they just gave me doesnt make sense
---
Far less than half of any games population uses forums, reddit is even more niche. Far less than a quarter of those post anything and instead just lurk searching for good content. At best, the people motivated enough to make an account and complain on the forums could be 1/8 of the total game pop. That is definitely the vocal minority, and that applies to more than just video games.
---
You seem to have the idea that just because someone owns a product automatically means they have are tech savvy enough to use the forums for that product.
---
Let me ask you this, do you drive a car? And if you do, do you frequent forums for your model of car?
---
Do you use public transit? If so, do you frequent town hall meetings?
---
Transportation is far more important and impactful to your life than a video game, why don't you? Are you not invested in what Honda includes next years model? Do you research and vote accordingly based on what your city needs to fulfill its transportation needs?
---
I posit that video games are a far less important part of the silent majority's lifestyle than most of the vocal complainers are willing to recognize.
---
100% with you. 
---
Most people are enjoying the game, and I guess the announcement was aimed to get new players: 30 USD for the whole game, no extra DLCs is huge for new players. 
---
I expected a lot more, but I was not disappointed.
---
This should have been part of an expansion.
---
I feel you, man.
---
Also in keg brawl
---
PvP is the endgame though.
---
If I wanted to spend money monthly, I'd play WoW. I don't, so I'm here.
---
I’m happy for you and a bit jealous. As a WvW player it is unfortunately disappointing to see more and more people leaving because nothing happens which will eventually hit casuals that will join only from time to time because no veterans are there anymore to lead them.
---
The future all the people flooding reddit (and even casual hero Wooden Potatoes) are interested in. I mean, you'll get what you want and i'll quit eventually over the next few weeks. Not sure why you'd be happy about that, but gratulations.
---
this is me pretty much, i saw the live event on facebook. i came here straight after to see how everyone was taking it, not surprised.
---
For me, the most fun content over the years is probably trading. 
---
I know, for most players this is probably boring content they like to avoidas much as possible, but for me its a nice way to connect with the game and its player base.
---
I mostly like it because it involves predicting how the player base will react to current or future changes to the game from Anet, which requires plenty of experience.
---
It also keeps me logging in when I dont play other regular content, like wvw or the pve LW updates because even though there is definately less going on on the TP when there are content draughts, its still a different scenario every day. 
---
I like it mostly because its competitive by nature (against all other players), its rewards scale higher than regular content, if you are good at it and, even though Anet sets the pherimeters with programming the game, the economy is basically balanced by the players (on a daily basis) and not Anet.
---
Another good think I like about trading is that it also sparks my interest for content updates that I am not too much interested in playing much myself, be it instanced pve content or reoccuring festivals for example because because new markets emerge for trading around the updates.
---
I want one please
---
I'm just very glad they fixed this in such a short amount of time! c: My friend told me this had been a bug for a while now. 
---
Tbh, I think the "lootbox" ban it total bullsh\*t as it only affects gamers, not online gamblers. Actual online gambling sites, to bet on sports for example, it still totally legal...
---
TBH I'm considering myself as a hardcore player, I don't hate on casual because I also enjoy the content that's made for them, and I feel like the hate is mostly from casuals towards hardcore than hardcore towards casuals (but toxic hardcore are usually really hateful).
---
Rail jack also evolved from just a new game mode to empyrian, it’s much bigger than originally intended and that’s why it was delayed
---
Doesn't sound familiar at all.
---
&gt;  that they promised a special outfit for everyone who watched the event
---
Who attended in person, irl, in the theater, yes.
---
&gt; we’ll give away some codes
---
You even quoted it
---
We already knew that build templates, alliances, and swis pvp was coming. They just reannounced what they've already announced, and they still haven't given us a date on any of these things besides soon™. They are as transparent as a brick wall.
---
Don't forget that he's been streaming a lot more in the last couple months, and subs can be a source of revenue.
---
Man WF and PoE has spoiled me for Dev contact. As players we generally have a feel for what is happening and going to happen with the game. If it's something we don't agree with we can "generally" get a round of positive feed back to each games CM/Dev team.
---
people report this..gosh this game has too much white knights...
---
BDO does the same: best combat system, makes you use a crappy matchlock/trina axe.
---
You are trolling him and then going "wow why do you do this" when he gets upset. This is what you wanted, this is what you were stimulating. If you hate that, look in the mirror.
---
Could you check for an update to arcdps\_bhud.dll &lt;[https://github.com/blish-hud/arcdps-bhud/releases](https://github.com/blish-hud/arcdps-bhud/releases)\&gt; located here? It's the bridge for ArcDPS and BlishHUD ([https://github.com/blish-hud](https://github.com/blish-hud))
---
They eid say "Expansion-like content"
---
Either get more info or stop lying. Devs tried to support ERP but with one condition: don't use cam hack. ThatPot refused and here we are.
---
Wait, you were that one person in the back of the crowd? I'm impressed you got singled out.
---
But seriously, that was kindof heartless of him. Though, he is a comedian, so it's kindof his job.
---
I mean this sure looks like great story content. But it will be done within a matter of hours and we'll wait another 3 months to see the next cutscene.
---
GW2 is an MMORPG. Nobody plays this game only for the story content, not even the ultra hard casual playerbase. If Anet wants to solely focus on this kind of content they can go ahead and create a completely seperate team that does all of this and release it as a seperate game. And people would love it.
---
But as of right now the focus on the story mode is killing GW2 and its community.
---
I'm happy that you're happy.
---
I'm also sympathetic to the people with different interests who got screwed by Anet.
---
I've never found the game to be very well geared toward sustaining the daily players with content. I may play casually now, but it has more to do with other factors than Anet's announcements.
---
Unfortunately players, veterans like you and I, tend to be more geared towards burning ourselves out of content. So what may be a little too small announcement stings much worse, especially if it isn't an announcement you wanted. Of course it's sad that you're disappointed, I hope you come back eventually because I still enjoy the game.
---
Ah yes, the moment everything went from "ok...." To "wtf am I even watching right now"
---
Wow. They just really want to remove the last tiny bit of aegis application that guardians were able to do on tome. It will be useless to use tome 3 now.
---
You're kidding, right? Anet's communication is some of the worst in the entire industry. It's utterly embarrassing.
---
You are the only guy my girlfriend is allowed to cheat me with!
---
Impressive!
---
It's cool! Why are people so mad?
---
That's just living story with extra steps.
---
Anet, after the lay-offs, is still bigger than what they were when they created GW2.
---
It's likely that half of their company is working on secret projects, as GW2's team is clearly understaffed.
---
You have to imagine my disappointment, after coming off Path of Fire, to know we're finally seeing Charr teritory and not getting Charr (or Norn) themed elite specs to go with it. We may even get some new face/horn options which would have been the perfect opportunity to make more characters. I got to make a whole plethora of Sunspears that I love to death who got a whole expansion to themselves and fitting new specializations for each of them. Charr just can't catch a break. I feel bad for Norn, too, but I'm not a Norn player so I can only really speak to the Murdercats.
---
Do you will get a permanent ban with no way to lift it. Good luck!
---
I dont think their focus with this announcement was to inform already existing customers about what they have planned (they already informed us about most of it via other channels/road maps/posts before) but to attract new players to the game and inform them about it what they currently get and can expect in the future, if they purchase PoF now. 
---
The stage of the announcement might be looking a bit overkill, compared to its revealed content for veteran players, but doing so durign AX West and with a live stream on twitch probably attracts alot more new players to the game than just giving out that info through their own sovcial media channels, like they have done in the past.
---
I am also sympathetic to those disappointed. I've been there before and know how it feels.
---
Because they barely announced any features, and provided absolutely zero detail about anything people cared for
---
There is a rather major difference though: The Varietal Seeds are only single use, as opposed to the other which grow back after a day.
---
I dont usually play these "shift the blame, let him defend himself" games but ok here we go.
---
Dont even have to go out to pick another studio, stay with Anet.
---
Guild Wars Prophecies, Factions, Nightfall, Eye of the North a buy to play game that still has a big player base as we speak, is on maintenance mode but has more content than gw2.
---
*PvE:*
---
-quests in normal mode (NM) and hard mode (HM),
---
-areas in NM and after beating the campaign in HM called vanquishing,
---
-missions in NM just for the story and HM, both versions offer 3 challenges be it time limitations or special objectives (4 main stories) ,
---
-elite areas both in NM and HM (Sorrows, The Deep, Urgoz, Fissure of Woe, Underworld, Domain of Anguish) rare rewards, repeatable + each consists of at least 4 subareas that differs from one another, doa for example has 4 with diferent challenges, skills, enemies etc, 
---
-dungeons (18 of them) each on NM or HM, offer variety of challenges, multi level dungeons with rare drops, guaranteed drops, skins, gold, extra chests,
---
-challenges for you and your hero achieving to beat as many mobs as possible, getting as far as possible to get rare drops, items to customize your heroes,
---
-skill hunter-thousands of bosses on all maps that offer a bounty like experience, once you kill them you can capture and learn their elite skills for the account,
---
-exploring 100% of the world that goes well with majority of HM open world pve.
---
This all goes hand in hand with plethora of different titles that actually matter, they work as a exp bar and each new rank you unlock gives you a new title and a power increase (Norn title r1 gives 10hp r7 300 - just an example). So it matters a lot what and where you equip it + certain pve only skills and their powers are connected to it.
---
*PvP:*
---
Never been much of a pvp player so I might forget something.
---
-Low level pvp arenas in certain cities 4 of them, 
---
-Random Arenas of 4v4 battles, 9 maps, different area objectives, effects,
---
-Team arenas similar to RA but you create your own team comp,
---
-Codex Arena 4v4 but with limited skills that reset on a timer (daily),
---
-Heroes Arena where you battle vs other player but you can control 3 of your heroes, basically 3 cap points and you operate on a tactical level and play 4 characters at the same time,
---
-Heroes Ascend where teams of 8 people battle it out in tournament style pvp, last instance consists of 1v1v1 teams and during these levels you have different objectives, 
---
-Faction based pvp missions where you siege or defend Fort Aspenwood or you gather jade in Jade Quary,
---
-Alliance battles 12v12 with points to cap and a middle castle objective with maps on the periphery. Its a fight for teritory and you can advance inland and capture your opposite factions fort, 
---
-GvG 8v8 in guild halls.
---
All these modes have plethora of map options, different objectives on different maps, usually tied to more than one title that works in a similar way than pve titles. Then there's other titles that we've seen in gw2 that derive from the 1st game. 
---
As the end game there are prestige titles, weapons, armors that cost a fortune + a Hall of Monuments with about 50 sub goals that benefit you in GW2 as well.
---
Before anyone starts throwing idiot shit "go play that". No. The game itself is outdated, runs on an 17th century engine, only knows x and y character move axis, somewhat poor character control with click to move or hold to move and no dodges. Majority of playerbase LOVED gw so much they blindly followed Anet to GW2 since we belived it will be a game just like gw1 in regards to content but better gameplay, visuals. Thats why the outcries, Anet did deliver heavily in the past, they know how to do it but they refuse to.
---
"i dont care that much about the game lol why everyone care so much"
---
yeah
---
&gt; I'm glad the game still releases new content on a regular basis.
---
Of course you're happy when you're getting what you want. The people who are complaining are the ones that aren't getting that amount of content in their favorite game mode, or literally any content in the past few years.
---
How would you feel if Anet decided to introduce open world pvp in new living story maps as a stepping stone for pvp and wvw?
---
How would you feel if they stopped making new LS maps and we just had a new raid wing every 3-4 months that's focused on Jormag lore?
---
&gt; It was the first MMO I'd played
---
There's part of the problem at least. I'm sensing quite a bit of first impression bias
---
One person with full garden and 8 friends can cook 96 feasts without need for replanting. 
---
It might come to the point I will be paying randoms to gather my garden, as i don't have friends. 
---
So guilds won't have problem, single people that wanted to gather stuff will. Oh and you need only 24 people + one guy with a garden to keep feast turned on for 24h non stop.
---
??? where did I said I want you to leave and being happy about it?
---
I haven't played any game for 6 months. Pretty fed up with current games/companies. Remember the times when they tried to make their games to be better than the competition? Nah, just make it as profitable as possible. Mediocrity sells to damn good
---
I'll see if I can add that tomorrow, sure
---
Honestly I feel the same. I know that I am happy because of being fairly disconnected from the expectations for any favourite game modes.
---
WvW used to be one of my favourite game modes too. It still is in a way, but I play too little to do what I used to and my incentives to do it are fairly small. Even if they're much better than they used to be.
---
no, its just not currently obtainable through any other means than buying one of the skyscale hatchling gathering tools that has it on the gem store. after a while, they will probably make a tradeable version which drops in black lion chests so they can go on tp
---
It's only 5 months this time Kappa
---
&gt; I came in with low expectations, but even then, I left disappointed.
---
You had expectations higher than you pretend. And that's what you complain about. 
---
Again, they announce cool stuff, but the way they hype it is what twists people's pants. PoF did it right. Big content out of nowhere, everyone happy. Here for this announcement, they didn't need a whole countdown and stuff. People were expecting more. You expected more.
---
Did they just throw in the worst? Like other than the wreath that I already own, I don't even want any of these for free.
---
On my server my guild is one of a few large WvW guilds. We always spend our WvW time searching for enemy guilds to fight and usually steamroll them or they run away to PvE the map. Then as soon as we go to take a keep then entire map queue shows up and it's a 50/50 chance whether our squad can deal with them or they win, by sheer numbers or by siege humping on inner with all the supply they brought from EB.
---
This is what I would really like to see Anet deal with in the WvW updates. Our guild wants to fight good opponents and we don't want to deal with map queues that don't know what they're doing.
---
It's been so long since I used v to dodge...
---
This would for sure have been a much better way to order it. I would be turned off at first by the “hey buy our merch” stuff but if they absolutely *had* to do that the beginning would have been probably the best possible part.
---
I think he took a break because he didn't like where the game was heading. He can always come back though.
---
&gt; They just reannounced what they've already announced
---
I guess their focus with this announcement was to reach new players (at PAX West and twitch) to communicate the state of the game and the future plans to them and not adress veteran players. They dont need to hire out a theatre to do that, they can just use existing social media channels to communicate with the veteran or regular player base because they usually cover those channels anyways.
---
People wanted anything that is above the bare minimum (story) and that they didn't already know about. Like [expansion level features](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/793355#Comment_793355) maybe? Instead we got confirmation that they are still working on the things that we knew they are working on (templates, swiss tournament system, wvw alliances) with no release dates aka more waiting and... strike missions I guess. A norn spirit mastery line that does what exactly? I have no idea. No exciting new features like gliding, mounts or elite specs before. Nothing.
---
I'm happy for you if you're fine with the bare minimum. Most people are not though.
---
I mean, they said that clearly in the stream
---
I wouldn't have minded bussing to Seattle for a big announcement of there was actually something to announce
---
We don’t just get only story instances with each release though.
---
So people are mad at the way it's been announced? Or does this new content go in the wrong direction?
---
i had much more fun buying the expansions than the free LW episodes they released.
---
sucks :/
---
Oh I don't think there will be a mount in September with the prologue, but this was not an event to announce just the prologue. Obviously I don't know for sure that there will be mounts coming somewhere in the saga, but there very well might.
---
Using old masteries was not *introduced* in dragonfall. They have used new masteries before sometimes more and sometimes less, but always in a very careful, never necessary and rarely even prominent way, since they could not be sure that all players have the possibility of access to those without additional purchases. We'll at least with the expansion masteries this is no longer true. You cannot play the icebrood saga and not have access to bouncing mushrooms! And this *IS* new. The problem does somewhat persist with older LS masteries and I'm curious to see how they will handle this(especially things like kodas flame), but their whole approach very much changed in a great and long requested way. For this dragonfall might actually have been the turning point in some srnse, but that does not mean that this development going forward is not a great and announcable feature(I at leas have been waiting for this approach since ls3e2 but all the more since pof).
---
They did not showcase the extend or impact of the masteries in any relevant form at all (which is one of the more reasonable points of criticism: things like this was very vague). They said it will be about spirits and start with owl. What impact this will have and whether the saga will bring along one or multiple lines we simply do not know.
---
I'm not saying that the prologue will have bigger plot twists/conclusions than episode 6, that would actually be weired, but this was not an event to introduce the prologue. This was an event to I troduce the new format and the prologue is the introduction to that and coming rather soon. I think we can expect the saga as a whole to go beyond what a season has historically been, although: when you are praising dragonfall you are actually already praising one result of the process that lead us here: trying to show that LW can be more than elaborate filler and have epic huge scale and feature ritch releases. The fact that dragonfall dwarfs bloodstone fen shows how far we have come already and they want to present what is to come as the next step.
---
Mathew Medina is that you. The expectations are a direct of of and logical consequence of anets actions. They should have foreseen it.
---
That is actually not true. He mentioned he got moved as well at some point in one of his Deconstructed videos.
---
Perhaps. But it's pretty crappy to ask for something to happen, and when it does, throw a fit about it.
---
"Hey, can your store get in X flavor of coke?" "We can try!"
---
\*X flavor of coke arrives\* "ABOUT DAMN TIME YOU GOT IT, THE OTHER STORE HAD IT FOR A WHILE."
---
People want anet to snap their fingers and instantly release stuff. Sorry, but RL doesn't happen that way. Does it suck that it's taken a while for such a feature to arrive? Hell fucking yes. But guess what? It's coming, and that's the part that matters.
---
Being an arse to the devs because they didn't do it on your timeframe isn't going to help a single thing.
---
I agree with what you said and feel the same way concerning combat. Combat can feel repetitive. Did you try the non-combat stuff? Just exploring the maps themselves (not just uncovering the map, really explording the details), the dialogs of NPCs, jumping puzzles, the hidden treasures? Maybe trying to do stuff the not-intended-but-cool way (skipping mechanics, mobs in dungeons, whatever)?
---
yeah, how I wish bdo wasn't so... well, how it is, in everything besides combat lol and even then combat is mostly grinding, there's so much you could do with it though
---
I was like you, until yesterday. 
---
Not anymore. I don't feel motivated to defend Anet at all.
---
As for people defending Aner, or being happy with the announcement - they are here. They are on forums. There aren't in large number, but still they exist.
---
Sadly, they sound like fanboys, or are payed to say what they have to say.
---
Mike O is the studio director and runs Arenanet overall.
---
Mike Z is the director and runs the operation of gw2
---
He‘s the President of Arenanet, of course is he still there. 
---
He only took over the work as game director for a short while after Colin left and gave that job later on to Mike Z. 
---
Being in Live shows and such is typical game director work so that‘s why Z was on the stage and nor O‘Brien.
---
Positivity in this sub?
---
Blasphemy.
---
lol. nice talk, you maybe should consider it and go to wow to play full recycle content ^^.
---
The combat. I love it. Sadly it shines only in high end content like raids/fractals/PvP/WvW and those are not Anet's priority.
---
physically cringe
---
Until 2017, Mike O was President **and** Game Director of Anet/GW2, then Mike Z took over the GD position, which is why he was the main man on stage.
---
How much were you payed to say that?
---
Funny how the ones who make the firing decisions be never seem to be fired, I wouldn't be surprised if there was a lack of reverse accountability
---
I assume math is not your favorite subject
---
One thing seems to be certain: ArenaNet didn't invite NCSoft to present merchandise at their event. So at least the end was NCSoft's idea.
---
But how could they be part of this really? Elite specs are so woven into the expansion content that I still have a hard time seeing them as part of these episodic releases. Think of the weapons collections for each spec, and the achievements that take you around all the different maps, meta events, currencies, etc. how would that even work for maps which are released one by one?  Then there are the hero points intended crossing all maps of the expansion, designed to pull you through the content, slowly allowing you to unlock your elite. What should we do instead, collect those points in core Tyria? What about the lore for each of those elites, where should that be delivered?  
---
Because of all this, I never expected elites to be part of a LW announcement, and felt like expectations for this were unrealistic. I agree it sucks, but reality in we are probably not going to get new elites for a very long time.
---
Uh, yeah. The fact that they said *nothing* (except for like three barely mildly interesting pieces of bullshit) leds me to believe that they're keeping it under wraps. Unlikely that S5 is literally nothing else but Spirits of the Wilds masteries, that one new map and strikes.
---
Doesn't matter though, you can interpret it as you want. But that's just it. Interpretion, we don't know it. 
---
Thought for a second there that I missed something.
---
LAWL you don't even play guild wars 2 anymore, I am interested to come to your "guild discord", and let's see if you can open your little bitch mouth lmfao. Go uninstall Gw2, your guild is shit in Raid ggwp./
---
Should have seen the E3 Blizzard presentation. There was a paid attendee in the crowd screaming at the dumbest shit. Pretty sure Todd Howard was heard off mic saying he wouldn't come back to E3 if they brought that guy back.
---
Guess what? Maybe Anet shouldn't have fucking done that then. We aren't blaming the team. Anet is the problem, and its their fault this happened.
---
It's a nice post spend more money to get good content pog.
---
In other words "I barely play the game and that's my formula to be satisfied"
---
I don't think NCsoft will allow them to admit it, tbh. Sadly, it looks like they've had a pretty tight grip since the layoffs.
---
Mature content below
---
If Anet played it fair:
---
- We are cuckholdong our competitive and veteran communities with enough tease of content so they would log in and get that cash into gemstore
---
- We do not care about class balance since our content designed around baboons pressing 1 and jerking off with other hand
---
No, I don't understand why you're mad.
---
Tbh I kinda like it, I'm from Seattle so it wasn't too hard to get it
---
As someone who works for a Fortune 500 company, yup. The big wigs don’t give a fuuuck
---
Don't you guys have shelves?
---
I am proud of you too, your account worth is less than mine now :).
---
Transparency ?? We know nothing more really than we knew before expect for maybe strike raids. We barely know anything about strike raids as it is anyway! 
---
It’s transparent I guess in the little they have on offer to show and that they don’t know where they are going.
---
Dude the gameplay in ff14 is fun why else do you think people are moving from gw2 to ff14? For the story? For the cosmetics? But w/e hope you have fun with gw2.
---
Well that's a nice interesting respond, I could agree with.
---
The 30th of August was the start of PAX west, so everybody was already there and ready for this type of thing
---
I 100% agree that people hyped themselves too much.
---
Wow... This looks incredible!
---
Really excited that they use more and longer cut scenes. The animations are really spot on. If this is the level all cut scenes will be in the next season/saga I'm all down for it
---
It's bugged, I have PoF &amp; it's not in the gem store for me either.
---
Patch notes say it's for available for players with Hot or PoF accounts.
---
People don't hate the trailer. Seriously, it looks amazing. They hate the lack of challenging content.
---
This is what is so frustrating about yesterday's debacle - the content they did reveal looks really exciting and I'm genuinely looking forward to playing it - but the manner of the presentation was so badly misjudged it overshadows the positives. 
---
Whether the fault for yesterday's misjudged mess lies with management, marketing, or Ncsoft, I have nothing but kudos for the devs themselves. You folks do good work, so let's try really hard not to loose sight of that.
---
This game wasn't supposed to be casual. Otherwise, there wouldn't be so many upset hardcore players. Game changed and became casual since casuals started gathering on gw2 for multiple reasons and they were the ones bringing more money
---
The people in the 2nd point aren't worth running after. If you're at a point with a game were you are waiting for content month in advance or you quit, or you keep playing but while moaning to yourself and complaining constantly... you're just hurting yourself. Stop doing that to yourself.
---
You are not obliged to play the same game everyday in your life. GW2 is particularly good at letting you come back at any point without making you feel guilty or feel that you've missed the train and it's too late. 
---
You won't be judge if you take a break. But if you start a thread saying the game is dead boring, you've done it all etc, three days after they added a new episode, a new raid wing or whatever you're used to do... I'll judge you.
---
Bexiled once you are spoiled.
---
Fun thing that with both DE and GGG I never felt to be left out during their events and presentations (aside real trip to space from DE). I live in other HEMISPHERE. I do not care about pre-event promotion of USA charity helping first world kids locally, when 14 percent of my country live below poverty line.
---
But no other HI node gives out resources that arent acquireable outside the HI.

And no other HI node requires you to make a considerable investment before you can actually harvest it.
---
Even retail WoW is doing far better and has a lot more interesting content currently, and ESO is going strong too...really not looking good
---
"I have to be a dramatic person or else I self destruct!" :D
---
The fact that they only release it now just underlines the fact that it was always a possibility and it was their choice not to make it. That makes it even worse if you ask me. I've used arcdps for build templates since the day it released, it's just a feature you need if you dont want to waste your time.
---
Yes you are correct. They want no money for an expansion-tier update to the game since they have nothing to show for it. Instead you get a promise that in September 17 you'll get the first episode and then in the indefinite future you will get the second episode. Also along side that you will get some lousy "Strike Missions" that were not explained thoroughly if this content is Open World or Instance based. I seriously doubt the future of GW2.
---
Lol who the fuck loves a company anyways everyone is there for their own gains and nothing else.
---
How does that help? Does it make the game better?
---
I am talking about the [future class balance changes](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/85188/potential-future-balance-changes) in wvw, where did you see them before?
---
Would you want more difficult combat encounters released regularly or more focus on the classes and balance of combat?
---
Example of mechanic showcase by game Director of PoE. It is rather simple. Not a rocket since.

This is why i asked this question. Never figured I'd get an answer like this one. That's actually really cool.
---
If an elder dragon wants to win me over, all they have to do is make Logan Cunningham (the narrator of Bastion, among others) respectively Salome Gunnarsdottir (Lysa in FF14) their speaker. Sold! /purr
---
Same. I'm all over the place in this game and there's just so much to do I'm not in any danger of running out unless i laser focus for months on end.
---
Well time to stop giving your money to liars.
---
- 1st chapter of the new season will drop 17 Sepetember
---
- 25 September will be the launch of the new raid wing
---
- 3 October Build templates and 2 new PvP game modes will launch
---
-15 October WvW balance pass will drop 
---
-12 November WvW Allaince system will drop. 
---
Etc etc etc. That is a roadmap.
---
Pretty balanced summation - highlighted the positives (or at the least where there's scope for some real positivity) but didn't shy away from the (sadly far too numerous) negatives.
---
Welcome to the Weird Gloomy Future, I guess.
---
Let me say it another way:
---
Anet, management, directors; Bad job.
---
Artists, Narrative, Engineers, Quality Control; Good job.
---
Know where to place the blame, and stop treating the creators like shit when it's literally on paper and dictated to them to create by the directors\management.
---
I don't know, a new expac is pretty important to me...
---
How dare they not show asura when they explicitly mention the story will be about norn &amp; charr?!
---
Okay, I understand. But [refer to this I commented in another topic here on reddit](https://i.imgur.com/aj4sz19.png).  
---
I am all in for new players, but will they stay if they see how veteran players are feeling?
---
Here's my honest take on your points. I can see that you do want to acknowledge that the game isn't dead, and it has a good amount of content especially for newcomers, and that we're getting new things at little to no cost upfront. 
---
But here's what you might be missing in all this. GW2 is not a simple story driven game, it's a MMO which caters to a wide variety of people with various interests. If partway through the game's life, people of a particular interest start to feel like their content is being ignored or released at a terribly slow pace, the game is essentially dead to them. It won't matter if they're getting free story updates, because they may play that once, and go back to raids, pvp, wvw, etc. and still feel bad about it.
---
What is there for those people to feel grateful for exactly? That the modes exist with very little innovation in the past couple months or years? They just have to keep pushing on in the hopes that something new will come to appeal to them, or they eventually run out of steam and outright quit the game. 
---
What you're seeing right now, is almost a final desperate plea from players of those game modes saying, "We want something to be excited for again, story mode isn't going to cut it".
---
While I appreciate the direction of the post, it's not really fair to expect the complainers to be grateful for little to no updates or additions to their favorite game modes.
---
 /Wiki requiem breeches
---
Yes , it's fine if that's the case. Just didn't know.
---
I've never used arcdps at all. And don't feel like my time has been wasted :P.
---
We never heard Zhaitan speak, but I'm willing to bet he sounded like Mike Tyson on helium.
---
Well it's a pretty fair assumption that we won't get elite specs, because it's a major selling point. And if they don't talk about a major selling point, then it's not coming.
---
Didn't they mention something like that, actually?
---
You can't acquire sab baubles (at all) outside of sab or candy corn (without opening trick or treat bags or buying on tp) outside of the festival or watchwork sprockets (without a special glyph)so how is this any different?
---
I've been actually thinking on the raid/fractals front about a possible solution to the long content droughts for them. 
---
I'm not sure if it's even possible in GW2's architecture to do, but i was thinking that they could implement a series of tiles that play groups could then influence what tiles they got for a fractal/raid. Layout, mutators, and difficulty level all set by the players before they go into it.  Tie it to some items you feed to a mist portal generator or something. 
---
That way the devs don't have to take the time to make a fully fleshed out story just a bunch of neat and challenging mechanics players can somewhat customize to their preferred challenge. Kind of a dungeon generator of sorts. That way they can semi regularly release smaller chunks of content quicker in between the major raids and fractals.
---
Call it "catacombs of the mists" or something like that.
---
I stand corrected.
---
Whooow. :o These are definitely peachy weapons!
---
Dude obviously living world content is coming, what you are making are stupid arguments. Amet doesnt wait 9+ momths to release living world comtent and festival get pumped out according to the time of year. Thid post is about the small amount of content left in the game that requires more than 3 brain cells. Here you come in with" WeLl tHeY diDnT sAy ThEY WeReNT XD". Its almost as if people were expecting "expansion lvl features" to be presented after waiting a month for this reveal. Instead what people got were living story updates, EZ mode raids, pvp skins, Alliances and Swiss are coming #soon, leggings and funko pops all of which could been summed up in a dev post.
---
Yep, this is how we're thinking too. I simply wont harvest that part of my garden and let my guildys do that.
---
That was true of both the AMAs and the forum chats. The forum chats were mostly a waste of time for everybody concerned, so I'm not surprised they've quietly abandoned them.
---
I know that is hard to grasp for such people like you...
---
But you can play multiple games Parallel and swich between them whenever the desire strikes you. You don´t need to leave one game for good when playing another one. This gaming extremism is something that allways baffles me when people act as if you are only allowed to play one game, and if you want to play something else you need to leave the other game to die. Diversity is gold if you don´t want to burn yourself out on a single game, especially when it comes to such long term comitments like MMOs. 
---
And while i regulary swich out my "side games" i would really like to keep GW2 as my main game because of the community, the gameplay and the time i allready invested in it.
---
Fun fact: Right now MHW is one of the Games i play beside GW2, so i´m allready dooing what you told me...
---
Or they retire / jump ship with a golden parachute and go on to fuck up another company. I really hate this system sometimes (most of the time).
---
Reminds me of [this Kurosawa short] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysAGW6n5Zgc)

Awesome little program, would it be possible to add auto updates for the  other ArcDPS addons? Specifically the ArcDPS Mechanics Plugin and the  Boon Table plugin as mentioned on [here](http://martionlabs.com/arcdps-mechanics-log-plugin/)
---
Hot beta was really fun.

"Anet told us months ago that we're getting a living world season next and we're angry the living world isn't giving us expansion level content for free so we're mad uwu"
---
I can respect that honesty
---
Players are your customers, not your friends and family. Your failures in management and staff mental health is a company concern; players should not settle with an inferior product just because your management and development directions have put you in the situation you are in.
---
I'd call the communication policy of ANet and a handful of other gaming companies "stone age," but honestly that's both incorrect and insulting. Living and working in a small tribe eking out a meager existence actually demands communication.
---
The silence of a lot of corporations on pressing issues involving their product is just *bizarre* and it seems unprecedented in history, at least to me. Especially products like games where the relationship is often perceived as much more of a personal one than a business one.
---

I really like the opportunities you give me to prove all your points wrong with one single picture.
---
Dear ANet... TALK WITH US QQ
---
I don't know how but somehow fractals have consistently gotten worse with every update to them. Maybe it's best they don't touch them at this point.
---
They arent in a financial struggle, their profits were too low so Ncsoft cut their supporting funds which was the cause for the layouts.
---
They have their budget for advertisements for the year and since they aren't gonna do anything else major I guess this was one way to try to make something fancier
---
That's not the problem. Problem is it seem like Anet don't want our money. We want expansions, new elite specs, housing, new weapons, new pvp, etc. Those things are money makers yet Anet seem to not want to do it. They must hate money.
---
I think we'd be fine with expansion level content for money. The problem is lack of content, period.
---
You know I love how everybody is acting as if the only reaction a person could have, period, is disappointment and sadness. Maybe he was excited for a specific thing? Maybe he left feeling just alright.
---
You finally got more value than 458% of all gw2 accounts registered on effiency? Please, just stop. It's impossible you're that stupid.
---
I love how middle aged men trying to defend people who work for salary for not delivering their work at the level they were previously able to. "Poor snowflakes, they need to recover since their friend was fired, maybe in year or two they start to do their work"
---
And someone say that millennials are complaining about their fate.
---
Still taking ages for me to load and still getting log-in server error
---
Yeah, that's a big part of it for me. It feels like Anet just yelled out a bunch of cool sounding names and didn't really tell us what any of them meant. Even as someone who liked Living Story as well as what little I could glean from the announcement, I'm still a bit let down, but now I'm also just confused. I feel like I know less about the future of GW2 than I did before the announcement.
---
What's the difference between a saga and living story seasons, and does that mean anything for how things are structured If not, why change the name,  because it sounds cooler? (Honestly,  I'd be fine if that were the case, but at least tell us that's the case, or at least that the structure will stay the same) Are we going to get smaller content drops more often, bigger content drops less often, exactly what we have right now, or are the three announced episodes all we're going to get? Without any confirmation of anything, all of those possibilities and more (including some worse possibilities) are equally likely, and it doesn't end well for anyone that the worst cases, such as having much smaller content drops even less often, is as possible as anything else.
---
Great post.  
---
Appreciation is so very important.
---
My main issue with all of this is hype.  Both players and Anet.  I tried a couple of posts before all this warning people not to hype themselves.  That's it's just the next season of story.  
---
What was as sad or perhaps actually worse is Anet starting hype.  Even before this, I thought it was a very bad decision.  Players already hype themselves (even when you warn them and try to tell them to reread that it's just story, not all the hype players are creating themselves) and that's very bad.  But when Anet starts on hype as well...wow, very bad decision.
---
I think it was Colin who did that a lot and I love MO's version of no hype and just show us the content.   It really helped cut down on some of the self-destructive hype most players make themselves.  
---
Any case, I was not at all surprised or disappointment by the announcement (even though I disagree with some details like changes to WvW proposed online).  Actually, it was more than I expected and that was nice.  
---
Anyway, thank you for your post.  It's wonderful.
---
"It's not content that I like so we don't have content UwU"
---
There's plenty of content through story, map events, bosses, metas, PvP, WvW, Achievements, collections, and whatever else you want to do.
---
&gt;what happened to simple enjoyment and acceptance?
---
Games got better and bigger and more regular over 15 years. Games are huge these days and rake in billions of dollars as an industry. They're also heavily monetized which allows for more content in some cases.
---
I as a player want new playable content or really awesome QoL like multi-classing.
---
That's not how this meme works.
---
EvE-Online. Not a typical RvRvR. Something bigger, with complex systems that would take you years/decades to gasp. Full loot on death. Engagement with enemy would pump your adrenaline quite hard. Game is 16 years old, had 3 engine reworks, and have major expansions each year (may be a bit out of touch, do not follow game in recent year or three)
---
Exactly. The stuff they actually showed on the video could have been artificially created and it'd always be correct, since it shows nothing of the **system**, just its net effect (which was clearly defined, after all we want build templating).
---
In other words, where's the UI teaser? Where's the WIP? Where's the various designs they're currently iterating between and we can give feedback? Where's the previous versions to show how it has internally grown? Where's the suprise beta test announced on stage?
---
There will be for sure. Didn't pve people got raids dedicated to some LS stuff every time?
---
I play it for the story content and lore. :(
---
First of all if Anet wasn’t lacking communication skills the community could understand ongoing internal issues hindering content releases.
---
But if that’s the case and Anet can only release this little amount of content then it’s simply not enough and your competitors will come for your players (and blood).
---
What has been (not) announced is simply not enough.
---
Thing is, there's over 200 employees at ArenaNet. Perhaps closer to 250. They're all doing SOMETHING. It made sense when we found out that a large number of them were working on other projects.
---
So what are they doing now? It's possible that they're less effective as they train new people, build new teams and adapt to the restructuring. But it's still a lot of highly skilled people.
---
I just want to know more.
---
same :)
---
I think that is a general statement and waiting times over weekends or holidays probably are a bit longer than during weekdays but that doesnt mean that support doesnt work at all at weekends.
---
And considering they just made their pax announcement to attract new players/returning players, I would assume that they anticipate a higher ticket volume this weekend and staff accordingly.
---
Exactly. It feels like a singe player game where some of the NPCs are played by other players.

Depends, actually if they would have release good free contents (I mean fun and repetable contents) then I would love to buy 10€ gems montly without np just to support them since in this way I knew my money would have actually invested into the game.
---
And I would also buy the expacs.
---
But yes in the state is the game right by now doesn’t deserve support in any way honestly
---
That's a fair point, I completely forgot about that.
---
In all seriousness, I wonder what does Anet think of all this negativity and how will they handle it...
---
Fastest downvote in the west.
---
Dropping of Elite specs would've been fine by me. Just the specs..

But, first half was already known stuff.

\[Rocking with some Charr\]([https://imgur.com/rnaxVmx](https://imgur.com/rnaxVmx))
---
I hope for the sake of GW2's story that Bangar gets proven right in the course of events over Rytlock and that he isn't just another Phlunt waiting to become a discarded mustache twirling antagonist. I will be so disappointed if he gets disposed of as some kind of Flame Legion sympathizer and Rytlock wins over the charr with a convenient unification plot.
---
Yeah...I’m strictly PvE, I don’t really care about WvW at all and even I think the presentation was concerning for you guys.  I’m glad something is coming, it feels like you’ve waited a long time for that something already.  And all you got was an announcement that it’s still coming someday.  If WvW was my thing, I’d also be upset.
---
Whats sad is that I already own all the gaze, the first thing and I dislike all the other stuff
---
Huh? I don't hate the game. Telling everybody to leave just because they are concerned about the direction of the game is kinda insane tho.
---
Marketing and development budgets are typically entirely separate. But it's good news, really. It means that NCSoft take the game seriously and want to build a greater brand out of the game. Look at all the fucking WoW merchandise that exists.
---
You can play gw1 right now.
---
Yea "more girding that what wow offers" xddd. but it's your perspective recycled content = new content. not mine xd
---
What if Bangar kills Rytlock and we not only have to deal with Jorgman and the grief of our friend dying, but also fighting against Bangar. One or more of Rytlock's cubs (not aged) will come and help us defeat him and one will take Rytlock's and Bangar's place and become the highest ranked of the Charr.
---
Since you are new to the game I understand that from the outside looking in the game is thriving. But from a player that has been playing this game for 6+ years, I have never seen so many players leave the game all at once let alone see WvW so empty so quickly. 
---
No one asked them to provide the content for free I am all for paying for content in game, I would even pay for WvW content and it has been offered before. But ArenaNet decided on this business model. 
---
My main focus is WvW but I have done all game modes and still play all game modes. But ignoring and entire section of the game is very detrimental to a game. This exodus has been a long time coming
---
0% chance they can continue developing new raid wings alongside Strike Missions. A lot of people from the raid team has left the company in the last 6-9 months.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; The problem is that all of this combines to form an enormous emotional investment on the part of the customer. They feel attached to the product, they want it to be the best it can be, and have strong opinions about it. It's become a part of their identity because it's what they spend so much time on, and they spend time in a community full of people who are also spending loads of time on it. So it reinforces the problem.
---
If you really love something, you'll want it to be better. Pretending everything is fine when it isn't like a brainless fanboy isn't love, it's stupidity.
---
They also said that the season would contain expansion like features... But apparently they forgot about those..
---
yeah, I'm definitly the one not playing the game thinking DS is needed for skyscale OMEGALUL. Btw I've added another screen for you to the album, I really hope you're happy with the pic of you :)
---
I'm happy too. I continue normally and enjoy doing dailies, achis, open-world, stories, WvW, dungeons, and occasional fractals and raids. Been playing from 30 min to 3 hours per day since GW2 was originally released.
---
What did they lie about?
---
i did it yesterday.   
---
google answers was scary because ppls are talking about days...  
---
thanks for hopeful answer.
---
LAWL I mixed dragonstand with dragonfall omg. how stupid i am. anywho.

https://prnt.sc/ozyzus
---
First of all, we don't know what the Season 2 will contain, beyond 2 episodes. I don't think that the first two episodes of Season 4 contained anything particularly remarkable but the third one contained a new mount and so did the last episode.
---
More to the point, what exactly is expansion like content. Most people only liken it to elite specs. Because stories and achievements and metas have all appeared in Living World before.  And if the sum total of your expansion like content is elite specs, then you don't really have an argument. This expansion like content argument is really an argument about people being annoyed because there are no elite specs.
---
Except that Anet actually announced new ten man boss content that is a lead up to raids, which I would certainly take as a new type of content that might be in an expansion. And they announced, even though we knew they were coming, build templates which are certainly something that might come in an expansion.
---
So tell me, besides build templates, what specific expansion like content did you expect and how do you know what's coming out after the second episode?
---
Renown Hearts can't replace quests though. The story instances don't either, since being instances ruined them in the first place.
---
Imagine if they had developed quests through a player-driven dynamic event system, and they were repeatable, and they branched into different paths depending on your performance or your player decisions, so every day you can replay the same quest and see the story unfold in a different way.
---
The issue is with this “Alliance” update only works if there are enough people to actually play. 
---
WvW is completely player based if you have very few players playing the game then what’s the point you know what I mean. 
---
At least Raids you can keep doing them even though they may be bland and the same at least your content will still be playable. (Not saying you raid or anything) 
---
I’m glad there is new living story and stuff to do other wise I would wonder what the guys in the office are doing. :P
---
&gt; how stupid i am 
---
after several months we finally have a breakthrough. I'm close to tears.
---
Yes, you truly are conveying yourself as someone who should be listened to!
---
Info they gave about story was actually things that I hope we would get. More charr and norn story, going north and all that stuff is really the direction I would like to see. I was also not expecting an expansion as they literally told how this will be a living world announcement and there wont be any expansion many times anyway.
---
The problem was the hype-building for this entire event. They actually managed to pull some nice marketing for this event with all that countdown, event and all but when it came to provide the high-note, they fell short. They could talk about how they will implement "expansion like content with living story" or further info about other content but instead we had that post-apocalyptic-lite-styled NC Soft dude talking about irrelevant stuff. If this was a blog-post with the trailer, it would suffice but here we are, after a 45 minute event which provided only enough info to fill a single A4 page
---
Dang, too real
---
It's possible they offered redundancy... some companies do that and let workers decide for themselves, if they want to take it. X number takes it, and if not enough,  they let others go
---
OK, I doubt that you will have this issue solved until tonight because especially with account access issues they are quite thorough in collection and verifying your provided info. Which basically is for your own protection, so no one else can access your account.
---
But I would submit a ticket anyways and try to get your issue solved, so next time you might want to check gw2 out again, like when the new season starts on sep 17th, you dont have to.
---
I would also suggest that even though you might not play gw2 regularly atm or the near future, to log in once, when new Living World episodes are life to unlock them for free instead of having to pay for them when you come back later.
---
brb leaving the game ive been playing for 7 years because of the engine lfmao
---
&gt;So you expect your group to babysit and carry you?
---
Isn't that how you're supposed to play this game?
---
Again, we are not forced to pay for anything other than the base game and its expansions. All of what we're getting outside of those is free content so we are in no position to complain and much less so to make demands.
---
There are some way more important things in there. 2v2 and 3v3 queue planned for example.
---
This is just a name change. Saga, Season - no difference.
---
It’s a move to provide new players with HOT mastery for future content since most new players only buy the current/newest content.  HOT is an old Expac that is depreciated to top it off. You having the inverse of this situation does not entitle you to a free expac that is still at market value. Most “vets” would of bought POF by now. I’m not sure why you thing getting it for free now makes sense when your are expected to buy new content as guild wars has always been buy to play.
---
I couldn't agree more, and it's quite aggravating to see how tribalistic it can be for some people.
---
Tribe can't be wrong. Never wrong. You disagree? Bunga you with club.
---
Some people handle that emotional investment in a productive fashion. They control it. Other people are controlled by their emotional investment.
---
what does the outfit look like?
---
It's the other way around. Those who presumably are having fun, come to those who have their complaints and belittle the issues rised by them.
---
You join a game with 7 years worth of new content and tell people who have been here since the announcement of the game, people who were here during the ups and downs, who see every game mode besides story going downhill  to leave. 
---
Fuck off.
---
It absolutely makes sense. At the time of GW2's launch the charr and the humans are still at war, there is a truce being worked on between Kryta and the Iron Legion (and it apparently is finalized between the Zhaitan campaign and HoT) BUT the diplomatic talks and any agreements are exclusively between the Iron Legion (the legion responsible for the charr territory explorable in GW2 so far) and does not include the Blood or Ash Legions (certainly not the Flame Legion). The Iron Legion have had far more exposure to the other races of Tyria through their proximity as well as acting as the main point of contact between the charr and the other races. The Ash and Blood legions are much more isolated and will be less friendly towards the other races as a result. Any Blood or Ash legion charr in central Tyria defer to the authority of the Iron Legion - the Black Citadel and Ascalon are seen as Iron Legion territory, charr from the other legions act under Iron Legion authority when in that terrain, obviously Flame Legion are outliers.
---
Rytlock's relationship to the other races (the Commander in many cases, Logan, Dragon's Watch) can easily be seen as a rejection of charr culture. He might have the title of Tribune but he is essentially rogue most of the time, following around and deferring to the commander, not leading himself. Rytlock's accomplishments and status are largely outside of charr culture and societal structures, not withing them - especially since he joined DE.
---
A charr legion which believes more in the strength of charr and what makes the charr great would easily look down on how much Rytlock relies on the other races more than he relies on his own people. To many charr they would think he should have accomplished what he did by working with his own people, not others.
---
It's been a while since I read it but I believe Rytlock is also known to have poor relationships within his own legion. I don't think it was every explicitly explained why. In my mind it actually wouldn't make sense for Rytlock to be welcomed back on the warmest of terms. He certainly will have some fans, but to many Blood legion charr, Rytlock should be seen as an outsider who turned his back on his own legion to work with the enemy.
---
Think of it as a US soldier leaving the US military to fight with the Russians against ISIS (not a perfect example but broadly similar to what I'm trying to explain).
---
If you threw all the episodes of an ls season together would it still wouldn't feel as meaty as HoT
---
&gt; Both huge companies and huge governments is there even a difference? still consist of old people who do everything the old way.
---
Yes we need more millennials to show us the light..... I mean it's not as if every single thing that your life relies on hasn't been invented and developed by "old people". 
---
Honestly, what a stupid and ignorant statement to make
---
I'm so tired from being asked to be understanding and understand the devs who obviously want the best but are just unfortunately forced to sell me products that aren't worth their money.
---
From battlefield to a few MMOs I play. I just want it to be business. How I need to be understanding, supporting, fan-art drawing and free-advertising customer, but the extent of involvement any dev will ever have with me is wether I give them 60$ or not?
---
Can they be understanding I feel like only paying 40$? Or that I'm not satisfied with my 60$ purchase while they are pretending I only paid for what was at release and any hype for future content is only a thing they drop immidiatelly after enough people purchased the released game?
---
Why is every studio suddenly a heartbreaking story about indie developer with 200 people and a world-wide trademark?
---
I'm not going to berate any dev, probably, even though sometimes I want to, but I refuse to care about anything he so vividly wrote out there in the tweets.
---
I just want it to be business again. I give you money, you give me what is promised and expected, end of story.
---
&gt; The game is still getting an influx of new players on a daily basis.
---
source please
---
btw. 5 new players you met today in queensdale is neither source, nor an influx
---
Tell me, how big is that part of the community. I hear stuff like that a lot. A big part of the community is quitting. A big part of the reddit/forum community? Maybe. How much is that as an actual percentage of the playerbase. I ask because that's an important question.  
---
There have been mass exoduses several times in the game's past. When ascended gear was first introduced, was a vast exodus. When HoT launched a lot of casuals felt the game was no longer for them and stopped playing and that continued on during the 9 month draught when all we had were raids and PvP tournaments. I think we lost more people than.
---
But I don't think the vast amounts of people leaving will be as massively damaging to the game as you think it will. I agree with your comments about uncertainty. And I do think Anet could handle things a lot better, but they're not going to change their stripes at this point. 
---
Build templates will not only be bound to legendary gear, of that I'm certain.
---
This sub is going through the five stages of grief, it’s rather interesting to watch
---
&gt; Funko since those sorts of things appeal to a lot of gamers
---
Yeah, but like a lot of people hate Pop figures in general.
---
You also seem to forget that the PoF announcement was 20 minutes, packed full of features and details and had practically no nonsense. This event was 40 minutes, which already makes it sound massive compared to the last expansion. They then proceeded to dance around most useful information and instead focused on fluff and these merchandising deals.
---
This announcement *did not warrant* an event this big.
---
&gt; ANet is a business
---
ANet is a business that has screwed up massively by focusing too much on new things and completely shattered the hopes of the fans when the studio lost a ton of its members. It's the studio that loves to act like a relatable indie studio when criticized, but walls up and acts like a massive corporate entity the rest of the time.
---
This was their opportunity to set the record straight, reassure their disheartened fans, and *secure the ongoing investment of these players.* They needed to do the business strategy of *appearing goddamn human* and instead proceeded with their facade of overconfident professionalism, completely ignoring all the problems that we're most concerned about.
---
In short, they fucked up.
---
Yeah and if the guy who should repair my sink is doing shit I don't applause him either.
---
A character slot, a bank slot, 2 free character bag slots, 1 shared inventory slot, a total makeover kit, 5-10 black lion keys. this is a customer **appreciation** package.
---
Jormag is non-binary! The voice actor is actually female and Jormag being non-binary was confirmed here:

---
Ah right, when you don't like something you're not an 'actual fan' anymore. I guess the overwhelming majority here is not a 'true fan' of the game then.
---
I was thinking of posting something similar today with all the negativity going around. I’m very happy. I’m happy with what we have, and what we get. And, I play a little Every Day. Been playing since gw1. 
---
I’m satisfied as long as the story and world will move forward, and that it does slowly with time.
---
I think the biggest issue here is that anet overhyped it. They made it sound like there was going to be this huge announcement, but there was very little in the end. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the last couple times they rented a theater/stage it was to announce PoF and HoT
---
They confirmed this isn't the case. It'll be like previous seasons.
---
Exactly. It's really disheartening.
---
As they should. At least expansion title would suffice. Ppl want to know there is a solid plan from Anet. The future is not clear, and that is why ppl are upset. 
---
And I would say NCsoft is bigger than Bethesda, and it is tied with Square Enix. Which means they are pretty much comparable. In terms of revenue at least. Maybe not popularity.
---
Give it a rest. Plenty of veterans still playing every day for many many years. I get it, you're not one of them. I'm just not sure why that should matter to me. Not with that attitude anyway.
---
Make sure you buy from an authorized dealer. I think the cheapest price around right now is dlgamer.com
---
Eyup.
---
Ah come one people start threads with titles like "I forgive you Anet, but I wount forget" thats not legitimate criticism thats cringy AF and arguably way worse than the level of cringe the "merch sales pitch" of the announcement was (and that's saying something).
---
Ah yes, Build Templates the 'new' announcement.
---
She's back
---
Which examples?
---
These problems don't come from the layoffs. The problems in the pace of content release and the type of content they focused on have been issues for years, and they're trying to blame it on lay offs. Alliances were announced 1.5 years ago. PvP barely got any support (and then they released 2v2 maps without a queue system, what a fucking joke). Raids get 2-3 bosses every 9 months. No new fractal CMs.
---
Literally anything that isn't living story and new, boring maps, are not getting enough content. I wouldn't even mind if they dropped most focus on pvp to focus on repeatable pve, or vice versa. But at least you'd have a direction to focus the game on. Single player content should not be the focus of a mmo. But they did this anyway, and then people are surprised why the game has to have so many gem store items and why it is not succesful for what it could have been.
---
Tbh the queues are a LOT less than in the past, server capacity has been reduced, amount of realms has been reduced and a LOT of the players are monkeys half-afking their rewards. But hey as long as you see players and can get queues its alive!
---
Bit of both honestly. Calling the people who were unenthused by the announcement event "fans" with quotation marks is certainly belittling, but I've also been told "live in your bubble while everyone around you leaves the game" after arguing that I enjoyed the annoucement and I'm excited for what they have in store for us.
---
People should just stop fighting or acting like this is some massive debate.
---
It would have been fine, but Anet overhyped this imo 
---
Announcing it long time in advance, sending twice memo about it on email, some of the devs comments and the actual event prep with a non Anet host and prolly more that I missed.
---
&gt;tiny nugget of information
---
Don't let your nuggets be so tiny then. Problem solved. 
---
Path of Exile, Warframe, FFXIV, Apex Legends all have their communication better by a country mile. I'm lost as to why Anet failed to learn in 7 years.
---
That announcement didn't have anything that we didn't knew already except story details and strike missions. How exciting.
---
If you don't like the fact that this subreddit is giving constructive criticism to ANet, then leave.
---
&gt;People have been saying this game "will not survive" for so long now.(...). ***It is alive and well***
---
Does anyone here need to remind you of the massive layoffs earlier this year? Go tell those people that the company is doing well.
---
Same.
---
You're right, that's why this exists. But It's stupid that people would complain that something they bought 5 years ago is now free, it's whiny and entitled. 
---
But everyone did it when the base game went F2P. And now we're complaining about a selection of free things that you received for buying something you'd have bought anyway 5 years ago.
---
With all due respect OP I've had enough of people telling me what I need to do. 
---
If I want to be pissed I'll be pissed, people will cool off five 'em time. Threads like this telling people to forget about things and move forward don't really help.
---
I think it's okay for the normal mode of a wing to be relatively easy. W4 is a good example.
---
But they really need to up their game for the CMs.
---
I think normal Wing 5 was too hard for most raiders. You can see a huge drop off in participation at that point. But Dhuum and Dhuum CM is amazing.
---
If all normal encounters were like W4 and all CMs were like Dhuum CM, I'd be happy.
---
There are only 2 genders
---
Very old look of mine, I knew it'd be useful someday [https://imgur.com/5x2uuuQ](https://imgur.com/5x2uuuQ)
---
I lol’ed too hard. Damn we got so many casuals in this game
---
Fractals aren't quite dead yet!
---
with the instability changes, the addition fSiren's reef, and the recent changes to Molten Furnace and Aquatic Ruins, ANet are working hard to kill them completely.
---
Bad choice of words. While technically this is true anyway, it really brings the discussion into a wrong direction. Now I hope it won't be adressed at all.
---
I mean, Elder Dragon gender doesn't really matter in the first place. I think the voice in the trailer fits well, and that's the most important thing.
---
Lion king remaster that we need lol
---
At the beginning, I thought it was Kodan, until the voice changed in to "monstrous" versions. It was really cool effect. I hope we won't be focusing on genders in game at all, dragons or not, and just enjoy fantasy world.
---

Thanks by the way for giving away codes with such a cool idea. I like it that it's also even possible to get some more codes like this!
---
&gt; Make a post on reddit

&gt; Don't event look that there is another post about the same thing

&gt; Ignore the fact that reddit TELLS YOU before making the post that there is a post about the same thing

&gt; Profit.
---
Unistalling it
---
A lot has been said already. All I'm going to add is last time I sat in front of my TV watching an announcement from Anet they told us Path of Fire was coming out within a month. This time, sitting there with no expectations, I was entirely unimpressed.
---
we can accept this fate or defy it, but we cannot deny it .
---
Hmm, possibly! Although Kralk was referred to as "Grandfather" - can't remember how Zhaitan and Mordy were referenced, if they were just "he" by default or if there were other references indicating a gender.
---
just leave 4Head
---
If it comes with new elite specs and a new feature like gliding or mounts, then yes.
---
He probably comes back from school/work, and queues during peak hours.
---
tbh, i think new armor sounds like a pretty sweet idea. gets a bunch of PvE only people into the queues, and maybe they decide they like pvp and just maybe they stick around
---
I woul absolutely rock that Title.
---
Yeaah..that was a bit disappointing lol.
---
At least it’s just a T-shirt I guess.
---
Anet designs to show off at GDC's to other developers, not for the players. They're the equivalent of insufferable arthouse films.
---
FF14:ARR was quite contrary. Sucked so hard that they had  to take it down and completly ramake it into ARR and they have been on roll ever since then. I don't think we will see this happen to FF anytime soon, especially since they have a lot of sub money.
---
thats where youre wrong - those are xpac features that were incorporated into the LW. just because we got new maps and masteries in the living world before doesnt mean its not longer an xpac feature. the only thing that are expansion specific are elite specs - and i think it should stay that way.
---
Genders have never been a focal point anyway, they're just there, unless they're important to the plot (Charr society and Sons of Svanir for example). It's refreshing to hear a different sort of voice though.
---
My thoughts when I saw this was that this is clearly a result of the new refocus on gw2. For the first time in a long time we seem to actually have a team to make new models and animations for actual cutscenes. 
---
Say what you want about the lackluster announcement, but what they did show us showed a living season of the next level. Let's just hope that it doesn't come at a large cost to the other parts of the game.
---
I mean, there’s some funny jokes in there, but this is just overwrought and forced for the most part
---
Destiny 2, Warframe, Star Citizen, Fallout 76...
---
subjugate me daddy
---
The first two are good enough. Star citizen is nowhere to be seen and they’re happy to sell 675$ dollar ships, and fallout 76 is a dumpster fire.
---
Same. But given the trend, I'm ready to be disappointed on this front again.
---
5. OMEGALUL
---
It would be very cathartic if GW2 ended with dealing with Jormag, and possibly solving other dragons at the same time, and going North, to ~~Vabbi~~ Far Shiverpeaks and Charr Homelands similarly to how we ended GW1 with Eye of the North. Maybe that's why it's so similar?
---
rytlock won't let me pet him, but jormag is giving me attention. what am i supposed to do?
---
And all the bad people are male, lead by a female dragon. If this doesn’t encapsulate 2019, then I don’t know what does.
---
Okay, so you have played since last expansion, can you honestly say that no talk about new elite specs or large features is not a huge miss on there part? I mean I don't know how frequently you play, maybe you still have new skills and other things to do. The vast majority of the community were looking for talk about new features, elite specs, etc. Anet made the hype way worse by renting a venue and counting it down. They don't communicate with the community so we are stuck trying to figure out what state the game is in. If they came out and said hey this is what we have to announce and we will talk about x, x, x in the future the community would be willing to say okay. They over 30,000 people watching on twitch and spend 10 minutes promoting merch.
---
Is this real or some fan made content? Because it's not on their official channel and honestly it's hard to imagine that any company would think this is good idea.
---
Didnt you post this already?
---
I think you and me both know you're not quitting. You love complaining just like all the others who continue to stick around a game they hate.
---
That's not true! Remember that patch where they removed Birds and Slippery Slope?
---
Where is the customer appreciation package? Like I got three things for free in the gem store, was it one of those things? I was high af so I don’t remember what they were and I opened everything, none of it made me feel appreciated.
---
Probably yes since they have a md5 checksum, makes checking for updates easy
---
If you think they'll respond to it, you're delusional.
---
&gt; fixation on expansions
---
It's something you can look forward too. You know what you get and you know it will keep you busy for a certain amount of time. You know there will be big stuff all at once and after that, you get the normal update stuff. They put effort into creating new assets and everything has a fresh and new look that excites people (unlike the things we've seen so far). It's also about the hype and the media coverage surrounding expansions that make the game feel alive.
---
You had to own HoT prior to the 30th of August 2019 to get it for free.

---
lol what that isn't me but w.e u say is true xD lmfao
---
I don't believe so but don't quote me
---
"what happened to simple enjoyment and acceptance? "
---
I've been thinking on this and I think quite a bit of the frustration is that we don't know what to accept or not.
---
If ANet would come out and say this is what GW2 is about and stick with it then people that dont want that can leave.
---
- But what ANet does is perpetually realign and announce they have new teams focused on X so expect some changes coming.
---
- And they introduce a new features or game mechanic but then it gets abandoned.
---
- Or the infamous "soon". Yeah I get that game companies always suffer from this but some of the "soon" things in GW2 is stretching on years for the WvW and PvP communities.
---
-e.g. We are going to get unique never repeating events, now we are going to do mini updates every 2 weeks, no how about expansion packs, updates every quarter now, ok new plan no more expansion packs but seasons will provide expansion pack quality in the seasons, no just kidding here is more of the same but we have realigned our teams so expect some new changes coming!
---
Plans change and new ideas are tried. I get that. But the players don't know what to expect so we don't know if we should move on or not because we keep getting teased with new plans coming soon just keep waiting.
---
It's their only source of revenue because ANET chose it that way. Most players would be happy to buy another big, feature and content packed expansion instead of the new "saga".
---
Expectations could have been managed better if Anet didnt overhype this event so much. They had a countdown for God's sake, implying that they had a huge bombshell to drop. So I think they are somewhat responsible for the reaction. Sure we ate dissapointed with the fact that they spent so much time on marketing and merch, but when you compare that reveal to TennoLive for warframe earlier this year, the reveal fell short imo
---
Haha I am not retarded, he wanted to flax his *gold. so did i do too more than his pathetic account lmfao\
---
They always talked about it in third person though or referred to it as "the dragon"
---
This moment!!! It ruined everything!! My hopes and respect for anet are gone!! 
---
This is not the right person.  How can they do marketing like this?! /cry
---
You act as if a company is some amorphous, nebulous being and not just the cumulative decisions of many developers.
---
Yes, I will tell developers when I think they are being negligent assholes and cease giving them my money.
---
They don't even have the decency of public test realms and for PoF didn't even do 2 week beta weekend class feedback threads before releasing their shit changes, so if they clearly don't respect my opinion or experience of the game, why should I reciprocate respect?
---
Good to see someone else has posted these two tweets here! I'm actually super duper happy about this new!  
---
And the voice actress, oh gods, I really home the marketing department will give Tom green light to share the name with us!
---
well ... I don't care. I didn't expect to get anything.
---
you're mad cause I beat your account value go farm more and "sell raids" oh wait you can't. Ur guildie did quit gw2 lel
---
A dumpster fire that delivered what they promised. Star Citizen is far more than just a game. With all games i listed i knew what i was waiting for and when it'd arrive. What do we know about GW2? That a living story is coming in a month or two. What's after that?
---
Dude same, the constant lags in wvw when three blobs are fighting just ruins the whole experience.
---
In another tween Abernathy specified that Jormag will be Non-binary, but your point still stands to a degree =)
---
IIRC they will send those "big" rewards within a week.
---
Great note, thanks!
---
Because it's Exceedingly more dangerous to talk to the community and have it come off the wrong way then to talk, but you fail to see the history of how you as a community have reacted to open dialog.
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
That's moving the goal posts.  Everyone was talking about viewership.
---
Actually retarded, lets support a company there ignores us.
---
So, jormag is a lady dragon. And?
---
Seriously i'm offended as how PC gw2 is... 
---
Just give us patriarcal raping torturer slavers and let us murder them?
---
PLEASE don't make gendered elder Dragons. THEY SHOULD NOT BE QUEER, FLUID, NOT CIS, arent they friggin asexual?
---
Imagine having a plastic surgeon give you crooked titties and tell you after you complain that he's just having troubles at home and his kids are being a pain, and that he might fix your titties in another procedure, which you'll pay for as well in maybe 6 months or a year down the line.
---
And then imagine lemmings telling you you have to feel sorry and continue to offer patronage to a person who's not doing a good job and providing the quality of product you expect.
---
I hope the fuck not indeed.
---
This!!!
---
Delivered what, a normal fallout experience which is what people expect from a fallout game AT LAUNCH? 
---
And yeah I guess star citizen is more than a game, it’s the biggest scam in the video games industry. 
---
Let’s look at roadmaps that backfired too shall we? Let’s ask Epic how theirs is going, and how people are reacting to it? 
---
And let’s ask fatshark who made vermintide how their roadmap at launch went down for them. 
---
Sure, a roadmap done well can be useful. No, a roadmap doesn’t guarantee what you’re asking for on the slightest. If the company is bad at communicating in the first place then a roadmap will do nothing but make promises it won’t uphold.
---
Have you ever had an imaginary argument in your head with someone then actually getting mad? That's the community right now. The announcement has always been about season 5 and the seasons have always been primarily about the story. I think having a 4th dedicated team is actually a good sign. They did say they won't neccesseraly work on the story and everything related to it. Does probably mean it's a dedicated team that pumps out fractals, raids, strike missions and endgame content in general. Does it mean more frequent raids? Probably not. Are strike missions a good alternitive for raids? Imo yes.
---
True, but as the OP suggests housing could be a good solution for PVE end game content.
---
Think we found "Mother".
---
Love your optimism and ethos around helping others and making the most of what we have rather than being a bottomless pit of greed...
---
I get that, and admire your enthusiasm. The thing is, no one would have minded of this had been a simple blog post. That's the crux of the matter here. The reason this has exploded as it has, is simply because ANet's marketing department screwed up, and is constantly screwing up. 
---
Had there been no "announcement", and a trailer dropped out of the blue on Aug 30th, with that level of quality, followed by a brief blog post announcing that "The new saga begins September 17th!" And "Build templates are coming!" And "HoT now free with PoF!", everyone would have been overjoyed and continued to wait for what's to come.
---
ArenaNet themselves made this out to be some huge event, people started to make bingo boards and "list of things we'd like to see announced at the event" videos etc. The mystery of the event, the hype and the scale they drummed it up to be, was not for our benefit, as current players. It was for new players to see GW2 make a huge announcement, offer HoT free. When all that we got was a new season announcement, not clarified as to why it's a saga, a passing mention about PvP and build templates with no elaboration at all, and time filled at the end with merch that has no place in a show like that, it hurts.
---
TL;DR: No one is complaining about the upcoming content. They're complaining about creating such a huge fuss, only to announce living world season 5 and build templates.
---
Nice try Anet PR employee!!!
---
Yeah, clearly devs aren't to blame for the abysmal state of class balance like power herald pve or reaper or the deletion of power mesmer all these years.
---
Devs aren't responsible for how unrewarding PoF content is, or how boring. Or the fact we just keep getting more maps that make the previous ones ghost towns instead of expanding upon the many dead maps we already have, core tyria in particular.
---
Clearly it's managers at fault for the awful design decisions developers make /s
---
Finally a "female" elder dragon! Gah so excited!
---
Mouse child!
---
[omg the future is female](https://forum.darksoftware.net/data/avatars/l/14/14164.jpg?1529611825)
---
(honestly though I don't see why it matters)
---
I got popcorn! Do you want some?
---
Yeah, the right picture is from GTA vice city, and you will got that T-shirt from doing everything in the game which is very enjoyable and memorable 50+ hours of gameplay. And I think of the T-shirt of guild wars 2 the same way of GTA’s.
---
Yet the developers don't care about you in any way meaning that not only your opinion but also your presence is wholly unncessary. I don't see why that is so hard to understand.
---
&gt; Is it unreasonable to believe new players coming into the game on a daily basis?
---
I'm asking for a source for influx. Influx means there is significant amount of them. I'm not claiming anything yet, show me what you based your statement on.
---
Bangar looks like a disgruntled disney uncle.
---
&gt;Thing is, there's over 200 employees at ArenaNet. Perhaps closer to 250. They're all doing SOMETHING
---
Valve has over 300 employees, I was saying the same thing about them waiting for episode 3.
---
Not at all. Irenio, Karl, Rober Gee, peters before he left for Amazon, Chapman before he left for Amazon.
---
Virtually all these class devs have been singlehandedly responsible for the terrible state of class balance in PvE for years and they don't get fired by the managers or replaced by people who can actually do the job.
---
how is that exploit? you could always inv 4 other ppl and let them gather stuff. if its your 4 accounts you get all rewards x5. weird that only now you say smth
---
If story was actually released in 8-9 months (like raids) you would be one of those complaining.
---
strike missions is like FF14 trials, and if its anything like it, im still all the more for it! titan landslides all over again and hopefully they put out extreme, savage , ultimates
---
You talking about gw2 as it is not grindfest is the biggest prove of you having no clue what you are talking about.
---
I knew HoT would become "free" sooner or later and i never expected to receive anything for being a veteran that had already purchased it when it was released. It's not an outfit that i'm probably going to ever use but definately it will always make remember that "i was there", "i was part of it". I don't mind if anet allows other people to purchase it at a low price later, i'll always remember that i received it for free.
---
&gt;Just give us patriarcal raping torturer slavers and let us murder them?
---
Only if while doing this you are going to be lead by a strong, independent Jora and at least one pair of lesbians.  (This is dangerously close to be true tbh).
---
&gt;arent they friggin asexual?
---
I think, I HOPE this is what he meant. And just used wrong words.
---
Even, it’s end up disappointing me. I will still play and support this game to the end. Like I play GTA vice city to 100% completion to get that t-shirt.
---
"mUh vIdEoGaMeS nEeD tO bE sErIoUs"
---
Go fuck off to a different game if you're gonna bitch then while people who actually enjoy a video game for being a video GAME (crazy thought, I know) actually enjoy themselves.
---
Maybe playing a number grinding game like Runescape or WoW will make you feel special
---
This is like with every other season - you unlock episodes while logging in during free aquisition period. To play IBS episodes, you need to have PoF (like with S4)
---
Yep you got it right.
---
My guess is the second to last lines are about Bangar raising Rytlock's child while Rytlock was lost in the mists?  Thats my guess but I havent been following the story much.
---
The general playerbase on reddit had pretty much the same mood back then as they have now.
---
Just leave the subreddit if you don't enjoy it here
---
and how does that have anything to do with the fact that you lied? even ignoring how you know how much i complain and what i prefer doing in the game.
---
They're pretty well known in the audiophile community because they have a plan that lets you stream lossless audio.
---
(Not that that gives any benefit for audio reproduction but people also buy 2000€ HDMI cables...)
---
Right? I’ve been playing since launch, have never watched a youtube/twitch account related to GW2 in that time - I watch streamers playing games I can’t afford/run/play, not games I like playing and play pretty consistently.
---
I always take these rant threads with a grain of salt because I know more players are like me - I just want to shoot shit in the face - and the vast majority are like my wife - who just wants to engage with whatever comes next. Lion’s Arch won’t become a lobby and there will always be someone in line to start streaming content. I for one am delighted at the apparent shift back to Anet’s original vision of no expansions/a constantly evolving Living World and I am enjoying the heck out of my new glider and ascended cheffing.
---
Yep, you've got it.
---
Achievements are NOT content.
---
This guy didn't understand it, just like anet. I spent time and money in this game, I don't care about your stress level or your employees. I want to play a fun game. (still don't get what anet wants with mobile games) If you can't provide it, people will leave like you see it now with ff14. I played gw since prophecies and was always a huge fan of it. I was super hyped when gw2 was announced and I had 3000 hours shit load of fun in this game. First I had fun with pve but that faded out very quickly because it is always the same and loot doesn't motivate you at all. Hours off collections.. For.. A skin? This is pure bullshit. That was the time I started pvp. Gw2 has in my oppinion the most fun pvp in all mmorpg. But the fact that they don't add anything.. Just left me baffled. Same maps and meta since release. It's a fckng joke. No new modes nothing, not even 1 underwater map. (don't mention that they let down the whole underwaterthing.. No changes at all) .. How hard can it be to bring templates, 2v2,3v3, tournaments, and new weapons and elite specs.. It seems like they just care about their fashion and well that is sure no motivation for me and I am sure for the most part of the players.. I would love to see the active player numbers now that classic is out and ff15 is making such a big success.

Anet is dead and not just since yesterday.
---
10/10 would upvote again.
---
I do not even know for whom this game anymore. It is definitely not an MMO aside trading post and fractals + raids. You can literally disable chat and never interact with people and still experience 90% of the game. Story rather mediocre to be anything competitive with any half decent SP title. Competitive modes are effectively dead. Visual style is filled with obnoxious shiny things.
---
I would say atm GW2 more of tech demo for RPG mount simulator. The only thing that I can say that game do great in the current state.
---
How is Non-Binary 'really shitty connotation'?
---
This tragedy, greater even than the derailing of Colin's hypetrain, must be undone.
---
You want us to watch a 30 min video to find out exactly where he said it or what?
---
They are a corporate entity who are not obliged to provide you, a non employee, any information whatsoever.
---
How is Non-Binary 'really shitty connotation'? It's literally correct usage of the term.
---
&gt; you could always inv 4 other ppl and let them gather stuff. if its your 4 accounts you get all rewards x5. weird that only now you say smth
---
Because with the other nodes, it wasnt a problem (and still isnt) because they dont have significant material investment requirements to make them harvestable or put out highly restricted materials that cant be farmed anywhere else.
---
If they wanted every player to be able to harvest ascended herbs without having to produce seeds before or leveling their chef to 500, they would just have added a couple of nodes into the open world that are on a daily account reset.
---
on top of all that Bangar hates Rytlock so is it rly a stretch to assume he'd call him a disappointment even if he didn't think of him as one.
---
that cute cat girl has a name! and she is not won’t to run from her troubles.
---
I don't think that's exactly it, but the answer is somewhere on those lines, yes.
---
Way too much focus on "appearances" rather than functional results. Make it look good, but not make it be good.
---
Aurene: Am i a joke to you?
---
For a game with a number of deeper female voices used already, I'm surprised more people didn't catch onto this already. It reminded me of characters like Eir or a female Kodan.
---
I wonder if his comment means she's a new voice actress to the game or not. I like what I've heard from her so far.
---
Aurene: am i a joke to you?
---
Everyone in this sub is way too uppity. I doubt they're so incompetent that they don't realize the weight of the PAX announcement. But I do think LS5 will now more or less be what either defines GW2 as a narrative driven saga with a complete, comprehensive goal - or will totally flop and be the undoing of ANet because they don't have the financial resources to actually improve the game in ANY meaningful capacity. LS5 is probably the biggest litmus test GW2 will ever go through for defining the future.
---
Very much doubt jormag is kralks mother... that wouldn’t make any sense. It’s possible all the else dragons share the same mother and are all siblings. Who knows maybe it’s aurene through some time travel shenanigans.
---
The problem is, we're still customers, and not just friends. I absolutely feel for arenanet, I really do, and I totally understand if they are not able to bring quite as much to the table due to changed directions. However, everytime there is a presentation except by expansions, the information given is so vague. Just look at the build templates segment in here.
---
For me it was not the content in this, but the way it was structured, yet again.
---
I'd kill to have some people to grind fractals with on weekend mornings. Just came back and I feel like I'll be stuck in tier 1/2 for quite awhile.
---
[deleted]
---
Who needs content updates when u can make ur own content \o/
---
I get it. Doesn’t change the fact that they were up front with what this announcement would be and have the right to announce anything any way they want.
---
Valve maintains 4 games, steam, and vr development. That's already more than anet with their 1 game.
---
Edit: Holy crap reddit servers no need to repost my reply 10x over
---
You know, I dont think we were told that either from the announcement LOL
---
But yeah its just a guess - seems like they will work the same like seasons, so if you log in on that day-months you should unlock it for free.
---
Honestly, I think most folks are like us, they just don't bother posting here or on the forums much if at all; a silent majority, if you will.  Just tend to dick around and have fun doing whatever.
---
And still, your posited theory can neither be proved or disproved without requiring the 'silent majority,' if it exists, to abandon its silence.
---
"Even though the vocal people disagree with me, the silent majority surely agrees with me" may feel good to believe, but the opinions of a truly silent majority are unknowable until they cease to be silent.
---
There’s no more EVOS or TTS?
---
Fair enough. I don't disagree that a character slot is more usefull. I jsut think that expecting anything at all is kind of mislead and then complaining about what we got even more so. To use your analogy: If your aunt gives you socks that are too big would you turn around and say: "This is awefull and some years ago you got me a sweater I liked very much, why didn't you get me one of these again?"  When rally there was no reason to expect a gift at all.
---
Charr don't really have "relationships" like humans would. They might find one another attractive and mate, but that's where it usually ends. If afterwards a female charr gives birth, she'll usually hand it off to a fahrar after a time where it'll continue to raised and educated. 
---
My guess is that Scar found out about Rytlock having a cub in a fahrar somewhere, and decided to take them under his wing without Rytlock knowing.
---
&gt;"Hey, we had rought times. We're still recovering, took longer than expected, but know this - we will bounce right back to the top. Just give us more time." and the community would be probably like "It's okay, we love you".
---
Sorry, what? People want information and explanations and not some PR garbage like you just gave as an example.
---
Why do you think people always mention the Warframe and PoE devs? Could it be the reason for that is them NOT giving answers like that?
---
Wow I can't believe I'm actually upvoting lishtenbird for once lmao
---
Thats right, stop delivering anything at all and lets see who pays the bills, after all they dont owe us anything. I guess when that happens they'll start 3d printing gold, ectos and new ascended food to take home to their families.
---
If you cant comperhend the connection let me try to understand it to you. Anet is selling GW2 and its "content", players buy that content to enjoy it, the money spent spreads out and eventually Anet devs get paid (obviously not every dollar spent on the game). Hence why the owe us. As soon as lack of content and players show it with money guess what happens. NCSoft bumps in and tells them whats up, last case letting xxxx people go. So do you still think they are completely free, no strings attached, owe players shit ?? Dont forget, its us who pay their bills not NCSoft or Arenanet. They'll cut funding as soon as they see something thats not profitable.
---
Just check the rewards systems for new weapon and armor skins. Vendor or crafting stuff, the most unexciting way there is to unlock something.
---
Loot in the game sucks, and you'll never get a drop you'll be proud of, never. These things aren't accidental, and I kid not when I say the gem store and its implications in the game's reward structure are one of the biggest hindrances to the overall game experience.
---
Compare that to GW1, where every mob had unique drops, and whatever a player was wearing was a mark of prestige. GW2 is the total opposite, flaunting wealth instead of actual hard work.
---
So much for horizontal progression systems.
---
They gave us information that was requested the most via social medias. They talked how they changed the script according to most popular questions.
---
What we want: meaning, engaging content
---
What we get: cringy furry cj material that probably took ages to create for essentially no payoff
---
Up to 45 minutes*, which usually means 35-40 if the show is not prerecorded and doesn't have strict script (and it didin't as you were able to see from MikeZ being absolutely stressed out and seemingly forgetting his lines due to said stress).
---
"The Kid wanted to kill an Elder Dragon. Never asked why."
---
I've been upvoting people I wouldn't expect to as well. Weird how all this... turned out a uniting experience for the community =/
---
I enjoy the scenery and moving through each location with the mounts. Combat is fun and I like doing the world events from time to time. I also like collecting different skins and dyes. The story is what I mainly play for though. 
---
I'm slowly getting into fractals and hopefully raids soon but I'm not rushing since my guilds ok only take new groups every once in awhile.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Epn6ZZResk it took me 2 seconds to find it on their channel.
---
And if you think Anet's marketing has improved since then, here, have a real GW2 ad that appeared on sites https://i.imgur.com/nd1kEwj.jpg
---
That part was mentioned as "preseason improvements".
---
i mean they could have given absolutely nothing, as all other mmos do.
---
*kudos
---
There is no single "kudo".
---
That's how scar got his scar, he got punched by rythlock! :O
---
You didnt mention content anywhere.... I bet u'd enjoy Batman the tell tale thingy. Or just a GW2 book.
---
Some of us want replayable content as well yet dont want to shit over what other people want. I'd never want to take your stories, open worlds etc to have my idk raids/dungeons/fotm. But somehow for the other side its acceptable to tell the hardcore pve group to fuck off if they dont like gw2. We too like gw2, thats why we want more depth.
---
Yes, I think he's quite experienced in finishing himself.
---
I haven't ever understood the need for this. Now before I can downvoted for not being 'PC', who benefits from this? Honest question. For my friends out there who are non-binary, LGBT, or any other minority, does stuff like this make you feel included? I personally don't see how having the big bad evil monster as non-binary is a compliment. I don't mind characters like Kas and Jory, but I don't feel like it's really that impactful to the story. Like if Kas was a dude then the story could be exactly the same. Thoughts?
---
That's not the only alternative from what I can tell. I think that's what the person above you was trying to point out as well.
---
nOt aN aCccTuuAaaAlL fAAaaanN.
---
This issue is that this is a lot of dev time whenever they could just restructure old content
---
Looks like an old 90’s Spawn character — looks amazing!
---
&gt; trying to add gender politics
---
&gt; usually genderless
---
So close to getting it, so very close...
---
Lmfao 10/10
---
Yeah, extremely abstract and not concrete. Not what people want to hear.
---
You pay for expansions. After that you're not owed anything. You aren't paying a monthly subscription for the game.
---
“Why are we having a meeting for something that could’ve been an email”
---
We knew LS was coming, that didn’t need the stage.
---
We knew build templates/wvw rework/pvp tournies, were all coming, that didn’t need the stage.
---
Irl merch, didn’t need the stage.
---
None of what I’ve seen needed the stage, and none of it needed the “expansion level hype” they made it out to be.
---
Nothing new was really added except that they told us the premise of the next LS season... which could’ve been done the same way other episodes were, with a YouTube video and a blog post.
---
cant beat a bit of jazz as the dun goes down ;)
---
They were tied to expansions but you still unlocked them regardless of what expansions you had. But unlocked in a "no need to buy", not "ready to play" sense.
---
They made him too cartoony. He looks like a character from Lion King. Just compare his design to Rytlock's.
---
And Yes it kinda a exploited because all other notes dont Vanish if Harvest with the Instance Creator. But the new Plants do, so if you do this Method you dont have to farm the seed again which to 100% was not intented by Arenanet.
---
Balanced PvP (I mean it doesn't have to be perfect, but an effort would be nice) and challenging group content. I don't play an MMO for a bite-sized, watered-down singleplayer story once every four months.
---
If you got your mail with no contents, message the support and they will help you. There was a forum post about it.
---
Bug is caused by receiving mail on pre-patch build.
---
Wasnt the original t-shirt joke from Monkey Island
---
Its the typical diverting of attention
---
A: "Hey there is a god"
---
B: "Ugh what, proove it"
---
A: "You proove there isnt one!"
---
So just leave it there.
---
It's true that realistically any expansion content can be a free release.
---
The issue here is, Anet has said this before. They have yet to deliver. They are either unwilling or for whatever reason unable to deliver level expansion content.
---
&gt;	releases content
---
I see what you did there
---
definitely burning up the place ;)
---
and dw reddit was down for me too  completely missed any spam =\]
---
This is just how blood legion greet each other.
---
There are things like character slots that you can buy, not just outfits and weapons.
---
Are you implying that the original team for The Lion King designed any of their characters to be furries then?
---
See you are missing the point. They promised plethora of things with first expax that only got delivered after the 2nd expansion. Also by that logic they dont have to deliver anything aka they can close the servers because people wont pay a dime for a stagnant game.
---
You clearly have no idea how things work in life.
---
Jormag gained his powers from making ASMR videos on sideline
---
its ok i seemed to have missed it all was down for me also =\]
---
To be fair, The Lion King's art did subtly become a basis for much of the furry community's style.
---
Look, we can't *all* have him, so you can kindly *step off, thanks.*
---
Rox
---
Woopsie, thanks for the warning!
---
I posted a similar post earlier today and took it off because of all the negativity I got on it. So I happily announce here that I'm quite happy as well.
---
Keep the game awesome Anet!!
---
*Stare into the deep, black eyes of Nightmare Aurene. For she hungers for souls..................and wallets*
---
Nonuple posting. Impressive!  ;)
---
After GWs  PvE letdown and lore shallowness I went to FFIXV to find the equally  cheesy story but endured it, instanced content is in better shape over there. But the combat system is insufferable after you have tasted GW2.
---
So I came back! 
---
To WvW which is slowly dying. The game mode was amazing before HoT, now is still good but quickly declining due to neglect.
---
Idk where I'll go if it doesn't get revitalized soon and by soon I mean a month or two max (not ANet's soon). My server disbanded, my guild already went on hiatus, the last two friends I have left that still somewhat play, rarely logged in during the past 2 months, one of them is happy on FFXIV btw.
---
I of course continue meeting nice people in WvW, but is saddening to see the same story repeating, people keep leaving.
---
So what you're saying is they delivered what they promised, just not in a timetable you liked. According to you they kept their promise in that situation.
---
&gt; it's been a while since GW2 wandered outside of fantasy RPG norms.
---
The whole game is playing the LGBTQ card, cmon you got everything in an Netflix way.
---
It worked.  I haven't played GW2 since it was released, we had 2 kids, and I had completely forgotten about it till now.  My wife and I used to play GW1 together as a team - before real life came along.  So now I need to check it out I suppose...
---
So in that case, "mission accomplished"??.
---
i wasn't expected soo much... but at least i had the feeling that they would tried to convince us that they will do with ls what they usually do with an expansion , and that ls will replace expansion in the future ... instead they probably will do that but without tell us nothing about all the important stuff....
---
I reaaaaally hope we get some more varied Charr faces in an update to go with this season!
---
If you only own PoF, it does currently not show up in the store. While my PoF only accounts unlocked HoT content just now, the gemstore still says I do not own HoT. Guess we'll have to wait a few days and hope everything is sorted out
---
Oof...
---
"We will talk about ____ in the coming months" followed by forum posts stating "we can't give a timeline yet" isn't transparency. Transparency would be "within 3 months we are aiming for x, within 6 we are aiming for y, within 9 we are looking at z". As of right now we have no idea what their priorities are, lots of items have already been discussed in the past. Are build templates targeted before 500 jeweling? Before PvP? Is WvW targeted for this year?
---
They have been barely able to get a new raid out every 10 months, and now people are expecting not only Strikes but raids as well ? When they didn't even mention a new raid coming ? With the only remarks about raids being how time consuming they are and how hard it is to find enough friends to do them ?
---
If I remember correctly we knew quite a few months before its release that W7 was coming. Anet could have just said that a new wing was in the works.
---
Raids are cancelled imo, until they announce differently.
---
Except they are delivering things. People are just disappointed with what they are delivering. Even though its exactly the things they wanted.
---
But that basically means the death of MMOs :(
---
Exactly. You hit the nail on the head
---
That's what I said.
---
Those instabilities were absolute nightmares! Lol
---
Bold to assume i never did.
---
So the most effextive way to farm gold in gw2 is grindind one of 3 maps to the death, till you can basically recite every dialouge from every npc.
---
Fractals are the same every day, raids are the same every week. 
---
Now i dont say othee mmos are not guilty of this. But in most others you at least have a variety of different stuff to grind. In GW2 every endgame PvE players grinds the same shit. For hour after hour.
---
No, I don't have a GW1 account with that mailing address, and I've tried multiple mailing addresses and the same problem persists.
---
In old datamines from the early living stories they were supposed to be related, but it seems they didn't go through with it.
---
Is work being done?
---
Is the game actually dying or are features still being worked on?
---
Is something I actually care about even on the radar?
---
Is content I'm looking forward to actually coming any time soon?
---
Is it actually coming at all?
---
Should I continue playing until that content comes along? 
---
If I like to, say, raid and wvw, and that's the content I enjoy, my current option is to more or less pointlessly grudge along hoping for some kind of scrap of information about either of these game modes, never knowing when or even if something will be said it released, especially when every passing week adds to the evidence that my wait is just going to get longer, and longer, and longer.... And longer.... For less and less content in a release. So... Why play? 
---
The answer is... Don't. I had no reasonable idea when more content I cared about would be coming since the story has been entirely uninteresting to me since the end of PoF, so I left. What's more, my entire guild did too, because look at that, we wanted to raid and we wanted to wvw. With no roadmap saying "it's coming in [month]" we had no reason to believe that the devs weren't planning on just ignoring us for another year or more, so we're gone. We were only about twenty or so people, but we're all adults, all have jobs, all have entertainment budgets, and between the twenty of us that's about $1,000 a month that just left the game and has no real intention or incentive to come back. Some months more, some months less, it's whatever but it's gone now, and while me and my small group and out 1k isn't much in the grand scheme of things, this is happening ALL OVER THE PLACE. A guild here, a raid squad there, and alliance there, people who played every day deciding enough is enough and that they're leaving, and they're taking their money with them. 
---
The toxic as shit casual community this game has encouraged might be saying good riddance to the vets and the hardcore, but at the end of the day those are the crowds that actually spend money on the game, advertise it by word of mouth, get their folks playing en masse. When they all decide to leave because all they can see on the horizon is 4 month gaps between 3 hour story chapters... Well. 
---
A roadmap is good for the game.
---
Jormeg.
---
When I started fractals 2 years ago, I loved the fact that some fractals where shorter than others. I loved that some were easier than others.
---
Then they changed the shorter ones. And all the new ones are longer and a damn chore to go through.
---
All the previous expacs were tied to the sub when i bought wod, i had to buy the battle chest then buy the new expac and then sub afterwards.
---
Glint and Aurene say hello.
---
Around 8:40 he starts to talk about it
---
Yes, and whenever I enter in any info into any box, the box remains red and when I press Sign Up, there's an error that just says "Undefined".
---
This! Thank you! 
---
I mean, if you are not ok with the game you have the right to be so and, if you want, to leave the game. But I personally really enjoy gw2, I enjoy the story, I enjoy the community I can find on my server and everything just paying some money one time and then some little more for the expansion! I know that I'm a true pve player and casual (a couple hours per day) but the game is not only for hard core players so pls. Let me say that I'm happy with the game and the current content!
---
The game is closer to the death needle than it is on the other levels of the spectrum.
---
When games go into maintainance mode like diablo 3 , destiny ,etc the writing is on the wall.
---
You are going to get the bare minimum effort by this company. There is no good future. There's more people leaving the game than joining. 
---
It's absolutely regressing and it's not even debatable. Pvp/WVW have never been in a worse state. The story is laughable maintainance mode drivel that is easy on resources so that's the direction they pick. 
---
Anet is taking no risks at all and trying to Innovate. They are just happy with doing the bare minimum since that's enough for some of the low standards people have for this game
---
'member when outspoken and loud parts of the community said "just get good"? I bet they are the same who say "just leave" now.
---
EVOS and TTS still run triple trouble, as well as RnT. 
---
the world bosses are easier due to mounts and power creep, but TT still requires coordination. no autoattacking mob will beat it, as evidenced by pug groups routinely failing it when they attempt non-guild-run TTs during world boss events. the guilds just make it appear super easy by erasing half the mechanics with blockers.
---
I don’t feel like I deserve anything the simple answer is and the same for most people lack of worthwhile content means they will go and take their money elsewhere. Arena net is not a charity I don’t feel obligated to spend time there they need to convince me not the other way round,  so I don’t think greed comes into this at all. If they want to make money they need to make the decisions that keep people playing their game, they are responsible for that no one else. They may have my money for buying the games in the first place and I fully agree I got my money worth ten fold, so why would I invest money into something further if it’s not offering me anything worthwhile to sink my time into ?
---
4 years after promised and all kinds of comms back and forth wont cut it. Certain modes have died out, full of bots just like GW thats on maintenance mode. What they deliver is not quality and half the time rushed (Kourna, weapons, leggy armor, leggy sigils,...).
---
Anet needed the slap in the face and with half the team size they seemed to come up with decent stuff in a short time, imagine what they could have done with heads completely in gw2. Plus the PR team lives back in the 1995 hurting Anet more than anything else.
---
Sylvari, Jennah, the LA trans NPC, some others gay NPC.
---
A bit further than just LGBTQ you got Taimi, Braham ( 1968 ) and probably others things I don't have in head. That's a lot and feel very political in a bad way.
---
Every new chapter usually add a new mastery or mechanic related to a new map, so idk why ppl complain about new expansion because some of the latest mounts are unlocked on the ls4 episodes, so pof still has stuff to be added and polished.
---
damn I miss Malcolm in the middle.
---
GW1 had a lot of content that was meant to be replayed many times WITHOUT PUNISHING YOU. GW2 on the other hand expects you to do many things once a day, once a week or once 3-4months forcing you to play in certain way instead of giving players free hand. On top of that other modes are basically abandoned.  
---
This game doesn't deserve us, fans of this franchise since 2005.
---
If you could get gw2hook working with this, I would download it in a second. The only reason I don't use the dx12 patch is because it doesn't work with gw2hook apparently
---
Just the first point is totally wrong so I wasted no time on the rest.
---
Casual do not move to another game. There are no other mmo for casuals . 
---
Casual does not mean kids. Casual means ppl with life who have not time fore three hours raid or cannot fight in wvw committed to get a castle. They enter, get a monument or a camp fight a zerge then leave. Same for pvp which is just a minigame to get weapons and armour .
---
There are no other game which are casual centered so they do not move so fast. You clearly have no idea of what the Devs are trying to do and they are doing it well
---
It actually was the very last point.
---
Cause you paid for these content updates, they are with you for the rest of time, and literally scar and change you for life. Yup, thats totally a realistic and apt comparison.
---
Get a fucking grip my dude.
---
You exclude every other group that isnt the included group. So let me explain it to you again, i cant understand it to you. When you create a group X and talk about it how ahhh and ohhh it is, you automatically exclude groups ABCD,..... Coming from people that want more equality that's really hypocritical. If you want to delete all the borders, limitations and differences then dont operate by creating those same things and excluding certain ammount of population. 
---
Why isnt it enough to discuss that Jormag is a primeval ice/snow/whatever dragon but it's genetic or orientational specifics have to be discussed? But if you do want to discuss said things, then accept other peoples' opinions that might not like Jormag as it has been presented.
---
Because it's bad.
---
Cool, I feel like you guys really are disproving OP's point hardcore :)
---
They/we are all uppity because we're BORED of waiting, FRUSTRATED from not having a roadmap, and TIRED of being disappointed.
---
It stings more than other games because most of us do see there's so much potential for this game's concepts and content to go from good to glorious.
---
I try NOT to get the incredible obsession with throwing genders to everything that doesn't need it.
---
&gt; Now before I can downvoted for not being 'PC', who benefits from this? 
---
It's just character trivia. The developer was responding to speculation if Jormag is nonbinary, and he said yes. There is nothing political or "PC" about it.
---
Speculated story purpose: Dragon of temptation, who tempts both men and women with seductive whispers of power ~~and asmr~~.
---
Indeed, watch again.
---
Holy shit, that was good. The laugh and the fight.
---
I think we can add Joko in with that. Voices that really shouldn't be that good, but totally are.
---
Post reveal, Jormag's look drastically changed. Incidentally, it changed to look like Drakkar.
---
Meanwhile, Drakkar's look is changing to look like the [ice column statue](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ice_column_statue).
---
So I'm wondering if they're retconning Jormag and Drakkar to match pre-GW2 player misconceptions that the creature under Drakkar Lake was Jormag. If so, then they also retcon later lore that Jormag woke far north of norn lands (near Kodan shores).
---
Or it's just looks they're retconning.
---
That's NCSoft's fault how exactly?
---
Wow is this so wrong. But classic causal thinking.
---
How long does the 2 for 1 deal on PoF and HoT last? Will it be forever? A few months?
---
You can tell the drones and fake accounts are out en-masse when suddenly these "lets blame NCSoft!!!" threads out of nowhere got a ton of upvotes.
---
I can't believe anyone who claims knowing about an upcoming reveal or event, and having zero expectations of it.
---
What corporation is your friend?
---
I disagree on most points, except for the casual direction.
---
So I guess we can‘t have any Cis-Men and -Women. We also can’t have Heterosexuals either since those are also groups.
---
Mate that doesn‘t make sense. You will always have „groups“ (identities) in your game so why not show the same spectrum that exists in the real world?
---
Also there are so many animals on this world who don‘t fit the binary system on this world so why would dragons not be potentially NB? (We‘re not even talking about Humans.) It would be an interesting fact that could lead to the explanation how Aurene is the Daughter of Glint (who then again is the Daughter of Kralk.). Maybe they were created kind of like Godzilla had their offspring in the 90‘s version.
---
When I clean out my material storage, is there a keyword I can use to filter out account bound mats? Also, the TP seems to be very slow for me atm. Any way to improve its responsiveness?
---
Wdym we choose to overhype they rented a theater, they made a 48h countdown on their twitch channel. If that doesnt give you hype then idk what gives.
---
If you don’t like complaining. Leave reddit. Take your own advise.
---
You realize being Non-Binary basically can mean the dragon is genderless...
---
Every one commenting says you are wrong but still Im objectively wrong. Spool lol
---
You are either confused or in denial.
---
Your english must not be good, because every single other comment has disagreed specifically with the point you're making.
---
Perfect, thanks!
---
Plus it doesn't matter, we should like a character based on its character not its gender and just to trigger people im calling jormag a she.
---
So... I can't say is sucked, even though it did, because I am ruining fun for others?
---
Not a single piece of that armor exists ingame.
---
I honestly am very excited for the new story!
---
srsly i would've accepted a GW2 mobile at this point......
---
I hope he grows into the first real mortal villain that isn't written off as a joke.

" Episodes of *The Icebrood Saga* can be unlocked for free by logging in to *Guild Wars 2* while they’re currently live (between an episode’s release date and the date of the next episode release). If you own *Guild Wars 2: Path of Fire*, you can play the episodes right away. I**f you don’t own the expansion, your unlocked episodes will be available to play as soon as you upgrade your account by purchasing it**. "
---
[Source](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/the-icebrood-saga-begins-september-17/)
---
Yeah, that have worked out really well with Wildstar
---
Edit: https://youtu.be/YbItL4qcugk?t=28
---
they tried it yesterday LOL
---
Not a single mention about raids either. Anet just hasnt learnt their lesson yet
---
It is not a corner. It's a market niche. Is it that hard to understand ? They cannot fight ff14 or wow on the same field other had been trying and failed .
---
Casuals just needed a mmo for those who want easy open world games . One of the main selling points was no raids . This is why I left wow and came here so making the core of the game  raids is exactly what would make ppl leave
---
But they have called kralkatorik male.
---
Yup... I hate the long fractals so much. It was nice that there were shorter ones if I was in a hurry. Now I just don't bother with fractals.
---
Well. I mean the game is named after the Guild Wars, it’s about not about the Guild Wars.
---
&gt; I might get a lot of flak for this, but I feel like I should say it: what happened to simple enjoyment and acceptance? 
---
I 100% agree with you. I like the game. I am reaching the point now where I'm wearing out and don't mind taking a few weeks off here and there, but I've definitely more than got my money's worth with the game and enjoyed it immensely. Guild Wars 2 is one of the games I've enjoyed playing most, ever.
---
I think they mismanaged the hype this time round, but Arenanet have been letting content out slowly and steadily. My only real wish is that they stopped pretending to act like an auteur and took more of a player-friendly approach. Considering one of the earliest parts of the game *involved players literally voting on changes to the game*, a little loosening on of the artistic vision for some easy, pandering wins would do them some good.
---
You seriously need to calm down dude. We’ll have to wait till the saga is out to see if any of it is good. Just because the reveal wasn’t good doesn’t mean that the game is ruined.
---
Thanks for this give away and GL everyone ! :)
---
Trying my luck with my [metalhead charr warrior](https://imgur.com/7orEfeS) \m/
---
Who cares what he thinks.
---
Excited? Hopeful? How dare you express hope and excitement on /r/Guildwars2, where all posts and comments must carry the message that the game is dead?
---
Let's hope. Let's just hope . U Say like it is a bad thing
---
And another drone in denial.
---
But thats where youre wrong. The silent majority doesnt have to speak out for you to know that. If the majority was throughly not content they simply just stop play the game, and thats something you would see by simply be ingame and not seeing others around. If youre so deadset on something being 'proven', go do that.
---
Considering account unlocks like character slots, bank slots, and bags are probably out of the question because they have some weight in server capacity, and probably have to stay paid to pay for their own costs, I'd go with something like this:
---
* Between 10 to 50 BL statuettes. At least 10 so people  can buy at least a total makeover kit.
---
* An unique customization visual that can be used anywhere like the victory rock novelty.
---
* An unique customization visual for HoT content since it's the HoT veteran package, like the Mordrem Glider we already got.
---
* A choice of a BL voucher (2 if it's the solo glider voucher, since they cost way less)
---
* And a choice between:
---
 * 4 guaranteed wardrobe unlocks
---
 * 2 guaranteed armor unlocks
---
 * 2 guaranteed weapon unlocks
---
 * 6 Mini Claim Tickets
---
 * 10 heroic boosters
---
That's probably asking for too much considering we already had a ton of time to play HoT before it god attached to PoF. But it's not a bad policy to ask for more, because you usually get less than what you asked for.
---
At the very least, I would have preferred if the choice box with the armors had a guaranteed wardrobe unlock available if you already owned all other items in the pack.
---
Same for all other choice containers with unlocks, like looted recipe boxes, those from chests, nodes, enemy drops and PvP/WvW tracks, not those from vendors. 
---
For example, if you got an exotic weapon or armor minstrel recipe box, and you already owned all recipes in the box, then an additional option to get a Freshwater pearl would be unlocked as a choice. If you did not have all recipes, then that last option would be grayed.  
---
Since trinket recipe boxes only have 3 items, then the alternate item would be much cheaper, a piece of mother-of-pearl.  
---
This way recipe boxes would not become worthless once you have all items, and more people would want to unlock all item in the recipe box since that'll mean recipe box drops would have valuables inside, thus increasing the value of worthless recipes until everyone gets them all.  
---
Past that point, then recipes should become salvageable, dropping plant fiber junk most of the time to refund the cost to salvage and give a few copper extra if a basic kit was used, but with a reasonable chance to also drop scribing materials.
---
Yeah thanks for the advise but apparently these -assetsrv commands break my launcher completely. As soon as I start to use them my launcher won't even start properly...
---
I hope they don't recon, if it was Jormag hiding under Drakkar Lake, whispering into Svanir's mind and not Drakkar... I'll be real sad
---
Hey guys, just got myself a refund for buying the hot/pof bundle, so now Im sitting on 1600 gems. I am lvl 72, so not at endgame yet. With 1600 gems I could afford a salvage copper thing and extra material storage(make it 500 instead of 250) but I coul also buy some living story since I dont have access to any episode. Are the living world episodes worth it if I dont care about story(Im just a loot oriented guy)? I also dont care about fashion, it's just a thing on the side for me.
---
Hateful? Has anyone so far been actually hateful towards anyone other than the merch guy? Everything I've seen is just disappointment and sadness and anger at how obvious it is they dont give a single fuck about their community. If they did, theyd have an actual show instead of the blog post we got. You know, talking about stuff other than merch. Like the game. And what's coming.
---
In my view, the "hardcore" players seem to be the ones that like the game the least. I sometimes think that if hardcore players left, they would leave behind them a better atmosphere for those of us who play to enjoy ourselves.
---
But here's the thing. Starting an "unpopular opinion" thread where you wish that an entire segment of the playerbase just fuck off and leave, because they enjoy a game differently to how you do, is a mean-spirited, unproductive, arrogant and immature way to approach the situation. You would be better off leaving yourself to find a game better tailored to your hardcore desires.
---
If you dont like it, leave.
---
&gt; Haha I am not retarded
---
Haha, you've already proven the opposite several times.
---
&gt; he wanted to flax his \*gold. 
---
What is "to flax" even supposed to mean?
---
&gt; so did i do too more than his pathetic account lmfao\\ 
---
You still didn't provide anything. 8 months ago you didn't even reach 100k account value and now you magically got more than 300k? :D Maybe if you actually invested all this time trying to come up with imaginary facts instead into treating your disorder you would get more return.
---
Yea, honestly when he said the prologue is free, I really felt like : ok they will announce saga as a spread out expansion or a "season pass" type of thing...
---
They never said new raids, strikes will be a steppings stone into raids but that doesn't mean new raids. Additionaly nothing about WvW and Fractals and even tho im curios about Swiss Tournements, its way to less for pvp too. Everything other than casual PvE is neglected as hell.
---
You are setting the bar pretty high for casual play.  For the first 3 years of GW2 there was no raids in the first place and many people simply do not care enough to even join the training runs
---
Who knew, they broke the dragon tonic exclusive with that tea event. And they might do the same with this one.
---
too much has changed since you last played to sum up. you have raids and fractals (basically smaller dungeons) to play if it interests you. there is still not a traditional gear treadmill, but you have a lot of things to grind for and discover.
---
people are discontent because anet failed to properly explain what will happen next for the game other than a premise and some vague references. in 2-3 weeks we'll hopefully have a better picture of that. these arent things that are relevant to a new player for the time being.
---
I hated HoT with a passion at the beginning. I guess I adapted now, but those weeks right after launch were one big headache for me because of dying every five steps as everything seemed to be tuned to groups. PoF I like for exploring, but yeah, something in between that lets you explore but have some solo challenge would be nice.  
---
I'm really interested in Strike Missions, I'm curious about raids but I have no idea how to get into them, gear aside. Having something to ease in players into that kind of content seems great to have
---
Looks really good, would be cool if it was available. At least the hood, the rest might be switchable.
---
Capes are another thing...
---
Yeah sure thats why they do that now, thats why Anet has to put in EZ mode Raids when the content itself is already easy enough. You have people that cry about being kicked for doing under 15k on immobile bosses. Yeah im sure by doing more world bosses will fix that problem when the fewish people that do the content on repeat just leave the community. Your best case scenario is people picking upclasses convinced that the new benchmarks are 1/4 of what they currently are because the EZ mode playerbase has no clue what they are doing.
---
"Expansion level content"
---
So do they have other Mikes running other projects?
---
Buy POF now and you will get hot too. Best moment to come back.
---
Ignore haters
---
So the Sons of Svanir are basically the nuns of GuildWars2, because they are only in love with Jormag?
---
if you dont like it, leave
---
Cause obviously none do raids . They are trying to show this kind of content and see if this will lead them to raids.
---
Yes, there's fractals now (5-man small dungeons, 25 varieties organized into 100 different difficulty levels, separated into 4 tiers) for all players, and raids (10-man, 7 current raid instances) for players with expansions
---
And as for all the vitriol on the sub right now, it's just a lot of mudslinging between hardcore and casual fans who feel like the game should be going in one direction. It's been aggravated right now because there was a recent announcement for the next living world season that's seemingly pushing the game towards the casual side even more, with the announcement itself being less than satisfying for a lot of players.
---
So people really want more communication with Anet so we know what direction the game is going. I wouldn't worry about it too much right now, the game is still going
---
I wish he could be a Promotion for Blood Legion Charracters... but I've felt the same about Rytlock for a while as well.
---
Game is 7 years old champ if people need ez mode to understand range deimos then thet probably need to stick with to their interactive cutscenes....i mean living world
---
Bye can I have your stuff?
---
Because if they said "we are going to change bounties a bit, but release a lot less of them" people would care even less.
---
As a new player, im scared of game shutting down? I been playing for few months now and i really like it. What do you think is this game still active and how far away is it from shutting down?
---
We're customers and we don't have to be considered with inside company drama. Yes, most of us are empathetic towards ArenaNet, since it's company we care about. But from customer point of view we can demand some level of quality and consistency in exchange for our money/time. Imagine your Smartphone broke, wouldnt you as a customer be upset? Or would you say "poor people work hard on this in factroy, I can't be mad it broke"
---
Nah, MMO needs a good balance of casuals and hardcore players to thrive. Just look at what happened to wildstar and look at what's happening to GW2.
---
They used concept art from 7 years ago...
---
The anger and panic over a dragon being nonbinary is so tangible that the Inquest could experiment on it. And it's all coming from people calling others "PC snowflakes".
---
Calm. The. Fuck. Down.
---
The problem is that what we saw was pretty cool if you actually like the living story.
---
The problem is that this did not warrant the same kind of presentation that was used for full legit expansion packs in the past
---
This is a particular market niche which let thsi game survive. Causal as the core. 
---
None has time for hardcore mmo we have a life we are no more 16 years old. They play Fortnite.
---
Gw2 is the perfect casual game and this is the best thing ever .
---
If after 7 years people still do not care enough about raids to learn them, game would not be dead with hardcore players leaving "champ".
---
Edit: In those 7 years people couldnt even learn about how to properly CC actually
---
&gt; than take your approach seriously and dont tell him that content he likes isnt content. 
---
Philosophically there is an objective sense of what is and isn't content. We all agree that Funko Pop figures are not content. We all agree that, for example, a new pvp gamemode is content. There is a spectrum. Pressing W to walk around the open world and then Pressing F to complete a collection is far, far to the left of content spectrum. He is more than capable of declaring it content, and I am more than justified in calling it "barely content." We can both be right. Now bug off you myopic toad.
---
Mike Rophon is recording the voices
---
But PoF sucked...
---
I think it’s fair because those are its competitors. 
---
I played Gw2 for 6 years and moved to FFXIV a few months ago and already see a world of difference from storytelling, proper roadmaps transparency from devs, content updates. 
---
Good mounts and fashion aren’t locked behind pay walls.  Plenty of content for hardcore and casuals alike. 
---
Gw2 revolves itself around the gem store because that’s the way the game makes money. Sub based models can focus on content updates instead of the next round of mount skins to squeeze money out their whales.
---
For returning players would it be possible to have a function that deletes everything &amp; reinstall everything? Or do the current functions already do that somehow?
---
i dont give a shit if i need to pay to play or not. if the content is what i enjoy i will support them financially
---
yikes/10
---
Yea, was just a bad joke, just as nuns say they are married to Jesus.
---
Rule 34 has entered the chat
---
Same
---
The way they kept talking about Eldritch/Cthulu/Lovecraftian inspirations as they showed new enemies... That didn't feel like a coincidence or accidental use of the term.
---
We goin deep sea horror bois
---
I say yes, €15 is a great deal for both of them
---
The expansions really open up the game, for both the hardcore and the casual communities, although the difficulty is noticeably higher, especially in Heart of Thorns
---
The negativity that people are expressing shouldn't be ignored, because many of the complaints are valid to a degree, but it also shouldn't be thought of as really representative of every player in the community
---
Have you tried crying about it on reddit
---
I still miss the real dungeons they murdered. Raiding is too gear/role intensive for me but dungeons where you could adapt (ie: exploit bugs) and then come out and buy a full armor set for every weight class, god damn do I miss that system.
---
 No just get PoF when it's on sale. You get a thank you package for already owning HoT
---
ArenaNet has a stable income over the cash shop. Look at the past numbers. 
---
It's very easy for them to calculate their budget. It's a few millions every month.
---
&gt;You exclude every Group that isn‘t included in the Group.
---
That‘s what you wrote so I pointed out that by your logic having Cis-Women and -Men in the game excludes every other group and thus we can‘t have them in the game. By your logic we can‘t have any identities in the game because by having any we exclude every other identity.
---
And you don‘t even know if it‘s „forced“. It was only said in one tweet so far.
---
Also how shocking that the Queer Representation is being talked about a lot because on one side we have People who are used to not being represented, who thus are happy that they can see themselves for once and on the other side we have people who can‘t stand having anything else than what they accept in the game and thus vent about it often. Do you know how we can change that? By representing it often enough that everyone gets used to it. There was a time where people lost their mind about mixed race on TV couples and one big reason why this isn‘t the case anymore is because it has been shown often enough.
---
I wouldn't mind paying a sub fee that's optional, as long as I get something out of it (nothing game breaking though of course). $10/month to get gems, and maybe an increased drop chance of cosmetics from BL chests or something (just throwing out an example, I don't really know what I'd want)
---
I don't think you can justify paying $10/month for a game that's historically been sub-free without getting anything in return, just on the hopes that the money gets used appropriately
---
I'm hoping we see Malice in the Prologue, and if so, this is going to be a very interesting meeting between the 3 Imperators (still expecting it to turn out Gaheron had a daughter who technically qualifies).
---
Going from what we know and have seen of them, Smodur feels like he's a smooth politician, able to read the flow of politics and make decisions that will go in the Charr's (and their allies) favor. Malice seems like she's able to keep aware of all goings on thanks to her spies and can, in a way, read the flow of history and know what actions can be disastrous for the Charr and which ones are beneficial. Bangar...is the wild card here, and comes across as somebody who is power hungry, sticks to the tradition of charr looking after only charr, and is akin to that powerful military general everybody fears and respects.
---
Between the three of them, I lean more towards Smodur being Khan-Ur (if they decide to finally crown one here) due to his political expertise and how he has worked with the other racial leaders in the past. It gives the Charr an outward appearance the other races can trust...all while Malice does her thing and sticks to the shadows, keeping her spies ears open for anything that can give the Charr an edge politically. As for Bangar, assuming he doesn't go all villain on us, he'll be in charge of one of the greatest military forces in Tyria, and would basically be given permission to storm other regions to destroy dragon minions, showing off the Charr military might and pride to the world.
---
But again, they're probably going to make Bangar a villain here, so watch him get replaced by one of his kids as Imperator as he succumbs to thirst for power and becomes an Icebrood minion later.
---
The announcement was the cheaper to get into no paying for HoT.
---
The "for the veterans" was a lie.
---
When that_shaman trolls the players is usually something more obvious.
---
This would be too cruel for his standards. 
---
So those were probably actually datamined.
---
There is no guild vs. guild, no. But neither is the game dead.
---
So 6 years later and the most vital part of GW1 hasnt made it into GUILD WARS 2? What a shame.
---
Don't call Fractals "deader" as they are. Calling everything in GW2 dead, will eventually really kill it one day.
---
At least on the EU servers you see 5 - 10 teams forming at the same time.True for Fractals and Raids.
---
My current Fractals LFG: [https://imgur.com/crL5XJ](https://imgur.com/crL5XJI)
---
My current Raids LFG: [https://imgur.com/vqcAcPj](https://imgur.com/vqcAcPj)
---
Don't forgot, we got an fractal update last month, where they completely reworked 2 old fractals.
---
Also: Yes if you try to find a team in midnight, this might be problematic or if you added 80% of the active community to your block list.
---
Because: If YOU block a player, then YOU are unable to see their lfgs, not vica versa (so the blocked player still can see and join your lfg).
---
But i must agree, they said nothing about fractals / raids (in yesterdays big announcement).
---
Which is kinda sad. :-(
---
A large part of the community feeling disappointing is not negated by YOUR feelings of the game being "outstanding" 
---
Most of us feel the game COULD be outstanding, if they stop making bone head decisions.
---
Well it’s true. The only worthwhile fashion to most players is usually just grinding gold to convert to gems. 
---
Sorry you don’t like my opinion.
---
Might as well be after yesterday’s stream. Even WP sounds pessimistic. The only content creators that are left are casual open world players.
---
Tell that to them next time you see a failed open world meta lol
---
If we're going to go with what's implied, then [these datamined texts](https://pastebin.com/kdi3FWRd) from the alternative finale to season 1 that never came to be, according to which Rox is Rytlock's half-sister, should be as good as anything else.
---
No raid in this game takes 3 hours if youre remotely competent fyi.
---
And people were failing open world events and bosses, and they still do.
---
They could pretty easily just do 1 elite per chapter and seed enough hero points around in the map to make it work. There's nothing stopping them from doing more than 6 entries in a saga, especially if there aren't plans for another expansion.
---
That's a good thought and something I considered, but I think the game does it better than I could.
---
All that needs to be done is delete your bin or bin64 folder, and the game should make a new one next time you launch it, clean of any third-party files. At that point you can close the game and then use this manager to pick what you like.
---
No hes right, cant be everyone now can it? Retail WoW is fucking casual, theres fucking lfr for gods sakes, why do you think so many people waited so long just so play an 18 year old version of the same game.
---
Oh god I hated this one. OG Ascalon background bestground.
---
Somebody put together a content map the other day which should help outline what's been added to the game - there really is too much to cover in comment.  The GW2 wiki is also a great resource for finding out what's in the game these days.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cx0fa2/i\_left\_guild\_wars\_2\_during\_what\_changed\_a/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cx0fa2/i_left_guild_wars_2_during_what_changed_a/)
---
you know exactly that I didnt mean play hours per day. 
---
that was not even a "nice try".
---
If you dislike/hate the subreddit as much as you make it out to be then simply leave.
---
Medina can shove off. He just saw it as a disappointment and did not look at it from the consumers perspective.
---
We were hyped up for the big reveal. We hoping for a good deal of concerns to be addressed. Those who paid to go to the event probably feel frustrated.
---
What we got was basically a small fraction of the show dedicated to the game and most of that concept work. A brief repeat of what were told about WvW and PvP. "News coming in the upcoming months" which is infuriating as we were expecting news now. And a massive chunk of the show dedicated to selling shit on black lion and merch.
---
Of course people are going to be pissed.
---
No one is accusing Anet of anything but being deaf to their community.
---
Retail wow the game with lfr raids isnt casual? I like how your main complaint is that you need to play the game, no wonder you like gw2 so much
---
You're overestimating the average gw2 player. The first few threads about this mess had some reasonable reactions because they popped up for people who stopped playing the game but didn't unsubscribe on reddit. 
---
Many people were saying that in comments. Now that crowd is moving on and you'll be back to the crazy circlejerk you see on this sub normally.
---
This.
---
It is easy to forget, but for $60 we got 3 years of enjoyment, and I have always bought all expansions on release.
---
$180 over 7 years. I spend more than that in a year on coffees and movie tickets, and get less enjoyment for my buck.
---
Anet is literally giving away free stuff that is a veteran status item, and they have no obligation whatsoever to do so. I can't help but feel that perhaps that "I deserve everything for free, and all that I want when I want it, or I will throw a tantrum" is quite the spoiled attitude.
---
Who the fuck says that a NB Character is any different than a Cis-Character? The Gender Identity (or sexuality) of a person tells you nothing about how that person acts, it only tells you the gender identity (and in the case of other species maybe how they have children, to throw it back to my Godzilla comment.). It tells you nothing about how the person acts.
---
Also you don‘t have to label a Cis-Person because unless it‘s stated any other way it is assumed that the person is Cis (and sometimes it is made clear by that Character having a Child, thus we know that Eir is a Cis-Women or that Rytlock is a Cis-Man.) And by the way you‘re wrong about „nobody is labeling entities in this game by gender“ there has been a Trans Character in Game for a couple years now (weird how people haven‘t immediatly called out the devs and demanded to have more representation of other gender identities because of it, seems your claim is wrong...)
---
Anything that People aren‘t used to will be discussed but that doesn‘t mean that it shouldn‘t be portrayed, otherwise we still wouldn‘t have mixed race characters (for instance) on tv.
---
And at the moment the person making a fuss about jormags gender is you btw...
---
*slow clap*
---
I don't believe money will fix anet/ncsoft duet
---
"Actually, this is good for bitcoin."
---
Shes not wrong. If an elder dragon dpoke to me like that... Id probably find myself a bloody smear after being seduced into bed
---
I kinda wish Anet would make a in game joke of this
---
LOL YOU"RE FUCKING JEALOUS THAT MY ACCOUNT IS MORE VALUED THEN YOUR SHITTY ONE! AND THAT"S A FACT!
---
casual has nothing to do with difficulty, it has to do with the amount of time you put into it. there are people who play 10 hours per day and only do open world shit, are they casuals? and maybe tone down the insults and putting words in my mouth.
---
I'm making a point just because something wasn't announced doesn't mean Anet aren't working on it. There are over 200 employees at Anet working on GW2 we don't know what every single dev is working on.
---
Didnt you watch the live stream, this is intended.
---
You're jealous i know it, I have plenty of value in-game then your dam account, of course It took me "7-8 months" not paying attention to your shitty low account, in few months i am going hit 400k Bruh git gud. plox
---
I quit like 5 years ago so joke's on you.
---
Also, it's not only the engine, game feels clumky af
---
Or maybe the narrator from animal planet
---
You completely missed a very important detail...i never said i consider them such due to their VAs. I said i consider them such due to their VOICES.
---
If you don't get it,you fucked up.
---
The entire blatant marketing bit at the end. When it came to PoFs announcement, they didn't even mention gemstone mount skins. We all knew it was coming, but they let us enjoy the patch for what it was. Then a few weeks later after the expansions release, they added the spooky mounts pack. 
---
However, it seems like ANet wasn't pulling as good of a profit as NCSoft liked, which is why they stepped in and forced the refocus and layoffs. They then spent a straight third of their time shilling merch, something that's very uncharacteristic for ANets previous announcement style.
---
LAWL Omegalul you're actually insane to think I have an account or accounts with "800 aps" LEL this is too funny :D.  bahahaha
---
Dungeon recipes have been bugged since 3rd September 2013. Detha, Hodgins, Tzark, Illyra, Rasolov still bug out and force you to restart the dungeon. Dungeons are indubitably unsupported
---
I've rarely seen such a huge strawman fallacy.
---
LOL didn't even need "3 druids" u are retarded asf.
---
Honestly, I heard people say they heard a male and female voice, and rewatched it and still sounded masculine to me
---
It might have been your favourite part, but it wasn’t the most vital. When GW1 was released, they intended for it to be a PvP focused game with a story mode as extra content. The reaction of players post-release changed things, as the story and PvE proved sizeably more popular, and so that’s where their attention shifted for subsequent releases, in GW1 and on into GW2. 
---
They intend to revamp WvW to be an Alliance battle, so that’s going to happen eventually. But more attention will always be on PvE, because there’s simply more PvE players.
---
So far you got nothing except some random screenshot from the internet :) And even if you were higher I couldn't care less.
---
no. i play this cause it's free. set a monthly fee and it will die. this is a market niche : casual + gemstore income.
---
Okay, so define a non-binary voice for me.
---
Id pay 20 Euros Dir a raid Wing and a cm fractal but I wouldn’t pay a sub fee tbh
---
No, I wouldn't. Buy to play is the promise since GW1.
---
So how about you link your API to actually prove it? Ah wait you can't ...
---
Well the thing was, we haven't had an expansion in a long time.
---
At the same time at the opposite end another problem was people were over-expecting things on what they wanted to see in the stream. "I can't wait to see "this" "this" and "this" when Anet clearly said the livestream was going to be for the next Living World update despite how long the stream was.
---
The reasons for being on edge don't necessarily mean the community's got any right to be bitchy. GW2 was scheduled to have pitfalls from the start imo because it was a massive endeavor to set out for without subs (which they still stand behind because it's what made them great). Now they've had daddy NCSoft coming to kick shit up, made plans on restructuring, and have promised to deliver expansion-worthy content in LS5 - all while bundling the announcement with a cash infusion at PAX. ANet's clearly defined their roadmap: LS5 should be good enough to keep the doors open. If it's not, well, GW2 probably won't have a third expansion.
---
CASUAL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DIFFICULTY. Yes people who play nothing but open world are fucking casuals. Answer me this chum, if they are unrelated why does Anet need to make ez mode raids for players like you who cant understand how to do content thats already 3+ years old and is already relatively easy as is. Training runs already exist and ee typically run with support scourges and use other strats that are essentially fool proof just to force a clear. Im sure thats why Anet has to nerf the difficulty of their roller beetle tracks, was probably just a coincidence.
---
Many People have been laying out what they want for literal years I’m not sure what more you want from people. Also not everyone is a monolith and of course some people are going to bitch without being constructive, but at the same time a lot of the people that might be salty now have also (as mentioned) been giving their constructive feedback for (as mentioned) literal years. You should remember that and factor that into your argument
---
Lore is for casuals! /s
---
Dungeons are absolutely not supported anymore. They still have bugs as old as *2013*, and dungeon breaking bugs *still* are common enough occurrences within runs. I recall one Anet dev straight up said the code is so ugly he'd rather not even begin touching it. Dungeons are dead and unsupported, end of story.
---
Have they ever re-structured raid content? It's exceedingly rare which lends to the belief that it isn't easy or cost-effective to do so.  I'd rather they work with systems they have confidence in their ability to modify.  I genuinely understand the frustration, but if you want more than one fractal every 6 months or raid every 9 months then you should want this system to succeed.  End of story.
---
I mean the gw2 model is pretty much war better then other p2p games, everyone knows that cou can drop 20$+ each month for something nice from the gemstore. 
---
I would rather pay for living season or big addons then a subscription. 
---
Paying like 10-15$ each month would push me away from the game because i would feel like i need to play to get my money worth and i dont have the time to play 4-x hours each day.
---
I am happy like it is!
---
Someone doesn't understand satire.
---
🦀 Anet is powerless against god Ash 🦀
---
Cloaks with hood on/hood off option would be cool, for thieves especially!
---
Strike missions were one of the few things I actually liked about the announcement. Now, I don't think they're a good replacement for raids, but taken on their own merits, I really like the idea of being able to quickly queue into a single engaging, challenging boss fight.  Obviously implementation is everything (is the fight interesting, are there little to no bugs, are the rewards good?), but personally I think the mode is promising.
---
Yeah, I played Legion to 24/40.  It was fun.  I'm not looking forward to Blight quite as much, but it'll give me some incentive to try some minion builds.  I almost posted Natalia's 2 posts / day for the past 1.5 weeks here.
---
No gvg now. Guild wars is called like this because of the guild wars. Events that happened before guild wars 1.
---
Why say "cut to the actual part" and not have a timestamp in the link?
---
Yeah  I think a lot of people are in shock and haven't accepted they put all they have out on their big stream. There will be no road map because this is all they have if it wasn't mentioned in the big announcement it's not going to be happening.
---
G2A is not an approved seller by the Lionguard and can lead to trouble if bought from. Just stick with the approved merchants so I don't have to come bail you out, recruit.

Don't even try it. It's extremely bannable.

I wouldn’t be surprised if it was in part forced by NCSoft since the end of the presentation had Robes McGee from NCSoft Marketing come out and try to push a bunch of merchandise
---
It’s hard because we don’t want to be shoehorned into a particular rotation. I want to smash pistol 3, go invis, shoot some more, 3 some more and have fun, not do this then do that.
---
Are you kidding? The game’s a treasure trove of content, only problem being we’ve done it already. I think it’s really the release cadence is awful so we go through the motions again when we’re tired of waiting.
---
It doesn’t keep the player base if it doesn’t put something on our plates often enough. Or if it serves the same stuff we’ve had a million times before. And doesn’t tell us what’s on the menu.

&gt;The request was aborted: Could not create SSL/TLS secure channel.

Womp womp womp woomp. Doesn't even install on win7. I googled a bit and I know that solution is possible, but honestly...

I ask you something on discord later ;)
---
Bad idea.
---
Have you tried with paypal?
---
Speak for yourself dude. Fractals have gotten way better every time they've updated them. Molten Facility is now much more engaging and you actually have to play the game, same withe aquatic fractal. People only bitch about it is because they don't know how to do the mechanics in the fight properly.
---
Probably new faces, hairstyles, horns and beards for charr and norn within LS5. Along with generally trying to make each episode contain significantly more meat, I'd bet my bottom dollar that's what ANet is considering "expansion worthy content." i.e. just like the Elonian styles. Maybe they'll retroactively do some sylvari for HoT.
---
Basically try to make the story itself as long as PoF, while providing new looks (some that can be used from character select no less). Kind of a depressing view, because long ago that was never even close to expansion worthy content - it was gemstore content and mostly everyone was fine.
---
Maybe try mentioning it to the support, maybe they’ll give you a chance to try to buy the sale later or reimburse you or something.
---
How does this son of a bitch already have a wiki page with spoilers for a story arc we can't play yet?
---
They have been fairly forward with information since LWS3, which is how I was able to construct the OP. If you look at everything that's been going on, a high amount of it is caused by uncertainty and the lack of confidence that the community has had in ANet since the firings. The lack of information across the entire announcement that the community has pointed out is worthy of a follow up by ANet to fill in the details.
---
I mean I totally get *wanting* an expansion (I'd like one myself), but I was really just commenting on those people who knew exactly what the announcement would be about, went in expecting more, and are acting like it's Anet's fault for making the announcement seem more than it was. We already knew what it was and wasn't going to be about, so I just don't get people's "they overhyped this" comments when we all knew they weren't going to blow us away with substantial front-end revamps to the game.
---
Go read again. Im making a fuss about people fussing genders. You are also too dense and want a fight but I cba. If treating people by their qualities is bad have it your own way.
---
Anything but G2A, also i would just skip the sale, your account is probably more important than some items.
---
so they legit wasted one year, on doing side projects but delivered some parts of the Season 5 mentioned in the video. So now we are getting the Living Story part of the Season 5. I want the episodes to come per week, worst case scenario per month. If it's per 2-3 months I'm done.
---
Amazon.com has it up, I preordered it for $47 inc shipping. There's a listing for it on the UK amazon as well but it's not avialble to preorder yet.
---
The problem is people just hype themself into orbit everytime there is an announcement and then are let down and angry afterwards, surprise surprise.
---
Anet allready said it will not be a big addon like hot or pof, but people are wierd.
---
But for op:
---
Game is great, much stuff changed and got better over time. I have a blast with every new story and living season (i am mainly pve player, dont do pvp or wvw)
---
Also the elite specs. are fun to play around with.
---
Currently enjoying my condi firebrand with loads of quickbess support (guardian).

Give it a try!

Let me guess, you're another player who spends 2 hours a week in game on open world and dressing up?

**Non-binary gender**
---
Non-binary is a spectrum of gender identities that are not exclusively masculine or exclusively feminine‍—‌identities that are outside the gender binary. Genderqueer is an earlier term with the same meaning, originating from queer zines of the 1980s.Non-binary people may identify as having two or more genders (being bigender or trigender); having no gender (agender, nongendered, genderless, genderfree or neutrois); moving between genders or having a fluctuating gender identity (genderfluid); being third gender or other-gendered (a category that includes those who do not place a name to their gender).Gender identity is separate from sexual or romantic orientation, and non-binary people have a variety of sexual orientations, just as transgender and cisgender people do.A non-binary gender is not associated with a specific gender expression, such as androgyny. Non-binary people as a group have a wide variety of gender expressions, and some may reject gender "identities" altogether.

The hacker known as 4chan must one day be stopped.
---
Dude we run out of good things to praise so duh. GW2 updates are so slow and infrequent I forget they even put new content into the game.
---
Not at all what I said.
---
Speaking of Flame Legion, I have a feeling they've taken a back seat and haven't shown up for a while for a reason. Due to the fact that Gaheron is gone and no Flame Imperator has risen up, I have a strong feeling Gaheron didn't have any male children, but females. It would explain why Flame hasn't shown up until now, and would make for a good twist. Especially if said child shows up at the meeting, since that could make for some interesting revelations and possible changes in the Charr hierarchy. 
---
It would also increase the need for a Khan-Ur immediately, because a law from a Khan-Ur stating that only female descendants of Flame could be a Flame Imperator would shut down the current iteration of Flame Legion for good.
---
Another drone-like shill...
---
With the exception of Kralk, the other elder dragons have always been referred to with gender neutral pronouns in game. I think Kralk was the same up until recently with the whole grandfather bit.
---
'well they're doing something, so we will see' has been something people have been telling me since 1 year in the launch. I can't really accept that anymore. =p
---
I think OP is talking about the guy from NCSoft that came on at the very end to present the merch stuff, and not Greg Miller.
---
&gt;I stand firm on the idea that Anet does things right,
---
Yep, not a shill or white knight at all.
---
&gt; Stop thinking about what will be better for Guild Wars 2 
---
Yeah, stop giving feedback and just enjoy the game!
---
I think EA and Activision Blizzard would like you to shill for them too.
---
After NCSoft's slap in the wrist, they don't have resources for such a niche feature that hardly anyone will use.  
---
The most they could do was setting two areas in two WvW maps for guilds to make their own.
---
There are some pretty good points you're making with this well presented post \^\^, however i have to disagree with a part of your 3rd point.
---
I think you're exaggerating when you say that "**every** single community" (with the added emphasis on every, too) is tired of Living World. Maybe you've just heard/read from a lot of people who don't enjoy Living World ? But I personnally really like LW updates, I think it's pretty cool to have extra bits of story, with one new map, new mastery and new achievements (often with other new features) that are added on a regular basis for free ! I mean I'd love to get a new expansion of course (and i agree that we shouldn't wait 5 years to get it xD), but i really don't mind waiting a bit more to get one if we have more Living World episodes to fill in ! And from what I've seen on the forums, on some reddit posts and by chatting with guildies, I know that I'm not the only one to have this opinion.  
---
Edit: Idk which "community" i'd fit in, i tend to be pretty casual but i've also been raiding regularly for 2 years (not a super hardcore raider tho), and i play PvP and WvW occasionally
---
You're not "better in everything" you can't Kstyle and to being with. Now sit your dumb ass down.
---
Praise!
---
Sure, ok
---
Issue with the game is that people just want something to bash on. Nothing more, game just announced that through autumn many great things will arrive, new story, build templates, pvp /wvw big stuff, and much more...
---
I'm amazed they didnt ban those replies... Maybe the bot that autobans you from Anet forums when you post was down?
---
Maybe they don't even care to be called Grandfather or Grandmother, since... well they are elder dragons and are well beyond such things as gender ?
---
The difference between all casuals leaving and all "hardcores" (mind the quotation marks) is that casuals usually just enjoy themselves and are able to move on with their lifes, while "hardcores" poison the mood and make for "outrage amidst players over X!" headlines on shitty MMO websites. One is stagnation at its worst, the other is destructive.
---
More like a disgruntled ~~grandfather~~ generalissimus, but I can hardly blame him. He's been at the head of Blood Legion for a time now, had his fair share of overly ambitious tribunes, but the one cub he wants to be ambitious keeps letting him down. Instead of taking over Blood Legion, Rytlock wants to go on adventures!
---
So we can't say how GW2 could improve and instead be just happy anet basically doesn't bother communicating properly and refusing to reply to proper feedback from people and only reply to praise and random fanart?
---
I'm sorry I bought HoT+PoF on 2 accounts, so I have all the right to complain as a customer that I do not like their service. But anyway GW2 is dead for me and a lot of others, I joined FF14 and enjoying the story much more than gw2 story and heard the ShB raids are 10 times better than gw2 raids so only good things to come.
---
Guild Wars being about players in guilds fighting has always been a misconception.
---
The name comes from guilds in the lore having wars, it has nothing to do with the players.
---
Newsflash: If player base thinks Dev doesnt do anything right it literally means dev doesnt do anything right.
---
Raids usually have 3 bosses
---
Take forever min 10 months to release
---
3-4 Months per episode
---
1 Strike per episode
---
3 Strikes 9-12 months 
---
3 Strikes = 3 Bosses
---
Strikes = Raids from now on
---
Do you always respond this way when people disagree with you?  Everyone agrees with this kind of speech until they hear something they don't like and berate anyone who doesn't agree with their line of thinking.  I'm troubled to think when you have actual conversations that matter IRL.
---
Yeah no, I don't know about every state but in many there's like no workers rights like that, most states they can fire you without cause and generally when layoffs happen they terminate the people who make the most money.
---
When even WoodenPotatos, someone who has defended ArenaNet through every bit of controversy they've been involved in, is also upset at how they handled this, you know they severely fucked up.
---
Vocal community is rather strange and complaining about everything, indeed, but they represent quite small % of playerbase. Rest of us enjoy playing the game instead of posting or reading about it.
---
Minor correction: we didn't get good structure until after the start of LWS3, the post HoT days saw a second content drought
---
Another slap to the face of any loyal veteran that has played consistently for the last 7 years.
---
Goodbye, slams the anet door super hard.
---
You post on literally every gw2 reddit post and 90% of what you say is just stupid shit like this
---
&gt;After NCSoft's slap in the wrist, they don't have resources
---
NCSoft's "slap in the wrist" forced ANet to focus MORE on the game, so they do have the resources since they're no longer moving resources away from the game for other crappy projects.
---
now ruby is reacting as well in a similar manner:  [https://twitter.com/Rubi\_/status/1167834722354941952?s=20](https://twitter.com/Rubi_/status/1167834722354941952?s=20) 
---
the gaslighting is kinda extreme and seems to be the first goto response to any criticism. yes, there are toxic assholes hiding behind the anonymity of the internet, and we shouldn't accept that kind of behaviour, but most comments (except the highly downvoted ones) were maybe brutal with criticism but not personal attacks at all. I didn't see much toxicity unless I sorted by new, and even then it was the minority. 
---
the most toxicity I see is towards ANet as a company not specific people (hogm probably getting the worst of it), but even then at some point how about not constantly focusing on that and using it as an excuse not to address the serious issues all the other people are bringing up? does 1% of bad apples immediately destroy any validity the 99% others have? in rubys eyes it clear does.
---
after those dirty tactics she expects us to feel empathy? I did feel some compassion towards her until I saw this tweet, but now I couldn't care less about her anymore, she's just another JP to forget. and no, obviously I'm not gonna attack her, but I won't ever take her seriously again either.
---
My computer does this to me all the time, it's an issue with your firewall. Run GW as an administrator and it'll fix the problem (at least, it did for me). If it still has issues with your debit then it's on the end of your bank. Hope this helps!
---
I think there are ways her legacy could be worked in!
---
Imagine the crew is heading to the far north, but they don’t have any maps of the area. It’s unknown territory. But who might have maps? Eir might’ve kept some at her homestead!
---
She was a strategist and leader, and she had five years to herself ~~assuming she wasn’t wrecked with crippling depression~~. She might have notes and ideas written down about the Icebrood.
---
The Commander may not be a norn, and have a loose connection to the Spirits of the Wild; but, Eir channeled the Spirits to make her sculptures. They could become a point of focus.
---
And of course, there’s Braham. Eir told him he has to let her go, but he could learn more about her legacy. He could do research about his mom’s ideas and implement them. He could better understand the legend that his mom was, and - assuming Anet doesn’t mess that up - allow him to become a bit of the legend she was.
---
What about Borje? He was a gladiatorial champion, but he might have history in the far north too; who’s to say he doesn’t have a piece in this? And we know he and Eir had a kid together at the very least, so what led up to that? Do we get to hear that story?
---
These are just the ideas off the top of my head. Granted, some of them have more potential than others, but just because Eir is gone doesn’t mean that she doesn’t still have a legacy. I’d love to hear more about who she was apart from her child - and I’d love to hear more of who she was as we learned in the book. I mean- she wasn’t just an archer. And it was her determination against Jormag that brought DE together in the first place. The Shiverpeaks is where they began as a team...
---
All that, and then there’s the importance of one’s legend in norn culture. The idea seems to be that one’s not truly dead unless their legend fails to live on. So: will hers? Will Anet even be thinking of it?
---
If they choose not to mention her, I don’t think the majority of the playerbase will notice. But that’s be a real shame - she had (has?) so much potential. That’s why her death was so disappointing and crushing for so many of us: she had so much more to offer and Anet just didn’t follow through.
---
I mean, admittedly I’m a big fan and her character probably falls into my special interests, but there are lots of ways she could be at least somewhat important or notable again. And I think that’s be a great touch.
---
warframe also makes waaaaay more money than guild wars 2 idk why they are so secretive
---
1. Sure hope for stuff. I didn't criticize OP for hoping or being disappointed. This is actually the first thing I wrote in my post. It's just air of superiority in the way he "forgave them" (so gracious) that does trigger a gag reflex.
---
2. Yes they did not say anything besides sharing a still pretty vague vision for how the next season will go beyond what previous seasons accomplished, a rather fancy trailer and a very few more specific details (such as the locations we will visit in the next 3 releases, the existance of strike missions etc). And I get why people wanted more, but at the same time they never said there would be more, we just inferred this due to the rented theater and a hunger for information and an expac in parts of the community.
---
3. So a host that is not even part of the studio made a pretty lame joke. I get it it is there event, so they are responsible, but seriously? The community has been pretty harsh with the devs for ages now, but once some journalist/host/whatever makes a lame joke the devs are supposed to fall to their knees and beg for forgiveness to the entier playerbase? Why?
---
I made myself laugh when I reread that one. 4chan's antics have been ignored for far too long.
---
NO.
---
Why the hell do people think adding a random subscription fee to a F2P/B2P game will fix it?
---
tibal ofc
---
Prime example of someone who understands nothing of business practices... Keep calling people spoiled and entitled, it's k.
---
Soon it will only be a circlejerk fiesta in here with people like you, enjoying the random art post and praising anet for its new gemstore outfit and how beautiful the last living story was. All the while, they still complains how inaccessible raids, how toxic the last 7 pvpers are and why the commander of the squad kicked their special snowflake ranger.
---
I don’t think it will shut down any time soon, if anything Gw2 is top priority for Anet right now. Thing is everything talked about here is nothing new. I’ll be honest it is nice to see what’s to come in the story, the overall arc and maps for the next few episodes........but all that is either confirmed on release trailers or speculated by the players, nothing really new or groundbreaking that required the hype and studio for this event. And things that were new got a 2 min spotlight like the new 10 man content or build templates. Not to mention that pvp and wvw got the short end of the stick.  Not really that bad, just disappointed that nothing expansion like was hinted at like Mike Z said.
---
That package is awful, what a miserable selection of skins, 99% of  which nobody wants.
---
Can somebody explain what happened? I'm totally out of the loop
---
There are a couple of guilds that run HoT metas in sequence. Dragon stand included. For me that was the least difficult part though. The ore was done in like 3 runs and I have leftovers for another if I decide to do another gen 2. I had to finish the masteries which took a while, but once they were done it meant I don't have to do them again. 
---
Map completion is easy with the constant running HoT Hero Point trains. The currency is fast with the previously mentioned guilds running metas. Honestly it was worth it. I much prefer my Shining Blade than if I had done Bolt.
---
You will miss playing GW2 after a week or a month.
---
The original name of Whetstone was due to her attempting to join the Stone warband, which Rytlock leads - she was Rox Pickheart before that. The Requiem: Rytlock story also fairly soundly trashes the idea of her being his daughter, as he mentions rarely seeing them and never being able to see them again while Rox is basically in the same room as him. I strongly suspect we'll see some of Rytlocks cubs in S5, but I'd be extremely surprised if Rox turned out to be one of them.
---
Mind trying to get some translator so I can actually understand what  you're trying to say? I tried on your discord but all of your friends  seem to be so ashamed of knowing you, noone actually wanted to speak up.
---
Instability rework, Twilight, Siren's Reef... The instability rework alone completely trashed every fractal.
---
Recently a highly anticipated announcement about the future of the game took place.
---
For context, this announcement was the lifeboat of the game's future, since players have already been nervous about the lack of content since the end of Living World Season 4. Among the launch of Vanilla WoW and the announcement of Archeage Unchained, people were looking for a reason to stay here, instead of well, play something else.
---
That said, the announcement was a big flop. The hype that was built around it from the company itself AND the fanbase wasn't on par with what was announced which, in my honest opinion, is really underwhelming.
---
So now many people are upset their favorite MMO is going down this path and many have simply decided to play other MMOs that listen to their community and have a constant stream of updates or just because their companies are simply more transparent than ArenaNet.
---
What would a roadmap change in that case? 
---
I take an example: they've announced working on changes on the structure of WvW a long time ago. A few months ago, they precised it and said they were aiming at a redistribution of players depending on their time of activities. It's been so long, I was starting to get skeptical about coming ever. They just announced they were still working on it (the Alliance system) and confirmed their vision of not wanting to push players to burn out trying to get a 24/7 cover. 
---
That's nice and all, but it's still not there, neither we or they know when it'll be live. It might still be cancelled. I don't see how this is different from a roadmap and how I should take it into account when I need to decide whether I play the game today or not.
---
I quit this game since PoF was out and checked out the stream yesterday. 
---
It was as unimpressive as I imagined. I thought reddit would still circlejerk on Anet. Surprised to see all these people finally waked up.
---
And if it does come to exist in game, it will be found in the gem store.
---
Nah didnt miss it. It was pretty obvious and fits the Far Shiverpeaks and Drakkar theme. Also makes me feel like we gonna just EOTN again now with cold mobs instead of fire mobs....
---
Blatantly false.  Standing still and autoattacking works in Queensdale, you'd be dead in ten seconds in CS.
---
Oh it's Nike_Phoros lol...
---
Non-existent.
---
Where are my concept art land-spears?
---
This is the cleanest and the best cutscene this game has had - using in-game models - in seven years. It looks *fucking good* even if you don't like Charr. Also really important to recognise I think is that although people are joking about Bangar looking like Scar from TLK, there's a ***very real advantage*** to this design of face:
---
Emotion.
---
Bangar is the most expressionate Charr we've seen, and the simplicity of his face allows that. The small movements of his eyes and, very noticeably compared to most other Charr faces, the smaller movements of his eyebrows. Bangar is also much better at doing the "sly" smile, his lips are easier to see on the face and the curl of them upwards at the corner is more noticeable.
---
Yeah, maybe he does look like Scar from TLK, but this has allowed the dev team to really inject visible and *subtle* emotion into his expressions and I think that deserves a lot of praise. It adds a lot to this cutscene, makes it feel like some of the best quality cutscene we've had in the entire existence of this game. I hope they can achieve this quality in all their cutscenes, across all their races. It's a step in the good direction... and it's really sad that it took seven years to get here.
---
if normal respawning nodes aren't a problem then single use nodes that actually take **effort and money** to replant shouldn't be problematic either, it also makes the game more social when people invite each other + keeps the price of ascended food acceptable
---
It's an old concept, but if you make enough waves in here they will find a way to bring it in the game as an outfit, then you can create another post where you thanks anet for the amazing outfit they made.
---
I do get the feeling that "hardcorers" don't play any other games. Hell, I like GW2 a lot, but like with anything, playing the same game for months on end will tire you. I don't get why so many people act like that's not the case. These people are getting tired of a game, and instead of reflecting on the fact that they've been playing the same game for long enough that it's time to play something else for a while, they decide that something is wrong with the game.
---
Ah I see, I'm. Very grateful for the explanation been asking for days tbh, I currently play eso a lot since my pc can't run gw2 as of late, it's good content but the mmo has its flaws
---
Well I think your understanding of "Horizontal Progression" is fundamentally wrong.
---
The term has little to do with the amount of game modes/end game GW2 has. It simply means that you can improve your character not through arbitrary number gains but rather through new skills and choices.
---
So in reality the opposite of what you've said is true. If GW2 didn't have horizontal progression it would be in bigger trouble since every old content would instantly become useless.
---
You can buy them all you want, lol. I craft my own =D
---
With the prospect of official build templates, access to leggy gear is more important than ever. Gating a HUGE QOL feature behind content that 90% of the playerbase won't touch just seems a little weird. 
---
Side note, FFXIV is LESS strict about rotations. I can play a bow (bard) dps and stick to spamming one skill for most of the raids and still end up with a clear (not that I would actually do that though). Also, there isn't a toxic community that would kick me for playing that way or shame me for my low dps (both bannable offenses in that game for que-ed content).
---
Imagine living a life where you truly think having an opinion is "too much".
---
In exchange for what?
---
Yeah, wtf were they thinking lol
---
WOW u came to my discord, that's quite sad I wanted to come to your guild discord and let's see if we could hang out for some talk :D.
---
Pointing you guys over to this other [tweet](https://twitter.com/tomabernathy/status/1167531094805110784) regarding Jormag's true gender.
---
We must have watched two different streams then, because in the stream they literally say he's from NCSoft, and on his linkedin it says he VP of marketing at NCSoft.
---
wow VA can be female, shocking
---
Which goes against Charr lore. He won't care about his cub who,  spoiler, is going to be Rox
---
Its just a living story. That's the disappointment. No expansion announce. No real future for the game announces, no elite spec announce, no new weapons announce. Just more living story. That what keeps us coming back for 4-6 hours ever 3-4 months. Its literally nothing at this point. 
---
WvW generally holds most of us over between those 3-4 months. Less and less incentive to log in. 
---
Yeah the story looks good. 
---
Just for those who say veteran players rush through the content. We don't rush through the content. The content is just so easy for serious. I explore the place, I watch the cutscenes and talking parts and all. 
---
If this "SAGA" comes out the same as LW its game over.
---
#HomelanderDidNothingWrong
---
Seriously, best super EVERRRRR
---
Yup. Let’s wait for the 17th and then we can complain once we get a taste. Not from an announce we were clearly told was about living world.
---
&gt;I have my opinions too.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Having opinions and expectations is never bad, but I think that at times like these, they are too much.  
---
&gt;Stop thinking about what will be better for Guild Wars 2 
---
Apply this to yourself before saying it to others.
---
You pretty much say people shouldn't have opinions and should shut up and play the game, yet your opinion can be freely said. Well done hypocrite.
---
That's the thing that makes me upset, the lack of clarity. In terms of the actual stuff announced I think it's pretty cool, not great but at least on par with what we've had before. But what are Sagas? Are they substantially different or are they just re-branding the Living World with a new name? Is expansion 3 in the works or are "Sagas" replacing them? The community shouldn't have this many doubts and questions after a big reveal like that.
---
People are barely interested in bounties as it is, I have very little hope strikes will even make it off the ground let alone be popular for an entire year. Remember ambushes? 🙄
---
bought few 2k gemmcards on ebay, no issues
---
Just look at some parts of the world where that is still a reality.
---
Erm...Reaper,Scourge,Spellbreaker?
---
-after HoT released
---
You must mean EotN?
---
The lack of self awareness you display is actually astounding.
---
Yeah man but now you gotta sit your arse and wait for more each month.
---
Also what the actual fuck @ /u/Krakzuldur look at yourself http://prntscr.com/p03apg holy shit. I think you need more help than myself thank you.
---
Those scripted interviews are so weak though. Its not an interview its just pretending.
---
My heart as well, we want more.
---
Ikr. Still no build templates or vanquishing maps.
---
Avoid G2A like the plague; they use stolen keys and chargebacks, so you'll just end up getting your account permanently banned with no hope of recovery.
---
Only the content he specifically wants to make him happy because developers should cater to him and people who agree with him on the stuff he likes.
---
Yeah because everyone who is left are gemstore fashion wars 2 players and once they start getting into raids people would stop complaining by ANet's logic.
---
It is certainly baffling why they haven't permanently added 1-3 bonus boxes of goods to various underplayed content and called it a day. The various events have already shown that it is good enough motivation.
---
GvG was fun and all but calling it the most vital part of Gw1 is laughable. If it was for you: great. If it some day comes for Gw2: even better, many people have asked for it over the years. But GW2 wount live or die on having GvGs or not - the community for that would be pretty dedicated (as it has been in regards to self organized GvG formats in the past) but also rather small.
---
Not to mention most if not all of the charr, player characters included.
---
This is backwards to me.  We have 5 “casual” players in my household and we only come back for story updates.  We don’t care about the in between fluff as it’s not rewarding and in the end has no purpose other than to prep for the next place to explore.  There are different types of casual and I suspect they have the numbers to justify the path they are choosing.
---
And 20 new outfits released in the gemstore in the same time. We can hope though.
---
Others have said using a VPN has fixed download issues for them.
---
They've literally confirmed the episodes use the same business model as every other LS season so I don't know why people keep saying this.
---
I don’t get this, what were you doing for 7 years? Nothing? If that is the answer then yeah, it was a waste, but surely it was worth it for the amount of time you have put in.
---
people at anet are rather woke, i doubt they will pay attention to gender that much. in healthy society nobody would pay attention to "omg he's black" "omg is that female or male" "omg i have to buy blue shampoo"
---
It's such a fucking retarded mindset.
---
If Toyota makes a shitty car I'm not gonna buy it just because some people got laid off while they were making it.
---
Dude you're retarded? you don't even know what is KStyle is. to being with shows how young you're. You're concerned of an adult beating your ugly head. That been said, you can't EVEN DO THE SIMPLE THING LITTLE BRO.
---
no no no no
---
you see, its not a season, its a SAGA
---
# FUCK YOU BUY OUR HOT TOPIC TSHIRT
---
This is too funny maybe it reflect about you. It did "Seems familiar" here comparison on picture based https://prnt.sc/p03apg :)
---
Anet decided to do the mobile game themselves. NCsoft wouldn't have came in and cancelled it if they told anet to do it in the first place.
---
You do know they had to finish season 4 before launching 5, don't you? it isn't like nothing has happened.
---
&gt;So, well just prove you're not a 15 year old kid so hardcore triggered   you had to made up some random account value just to feel superior 
---
You failed again.
---
&gt; firing on all cylinders

heh

Not everything has to be about representation.

The character is non-binary and... that's it. Nothing else to it.

You called? :&gt;

700 gems outfit Soon ^TM
---
They have a Marketing team?
---
Is that Sam Riegel voicing Bangar? He really does get around in this game, huh.
---
I've been playing since the very beginning and I quit around the time of PoF.
---
ANet are absolutely inept when it comes to PR and advertising, so they might have forgotten about mentioning it, or decided it wasn't worth mentioning over funko pops. It's their usual level of fuckup, get used to it.
---
cheers ! :)
---
You can't be that dense, can you?
---
While this is true, ArenaNet's employees; devs, etc., have made notable efforts over the years to be a part of the community, to be *friendly.* They have tried to be involved with us. I know it's not just Anet who does that with their respective communities, but I dunno, I've always felt that the people who work at ArenaNet seemed just a smidge more genuine than others out there? No, the company is not our friend, and no, the employees aren't our friends. But, it's still something.
---
Sure, it might just be PR or an internal policy, *"be nice to players,"* but that doesn't mean it's malicious. Can we at least give credit where credit is due?
---
strikes are just gonna be 10 player bounties
---
Not from ANet. They've completely lost my trust, and it would take nothing short of a miracle to regain it.
---
While I would personally like this, simply doing so across the board would disenfranchise a huge part of the community, particularly parts of the communtiy that don't write essays on reddit every day. So this would be a bad idea. 
---
They actually did try this with HoT (and I thought it was awesome), but there was a huge backlash and they were ultimately forced to nerf things. The ideal would be finding a way to make large parts of the content interesting for as many demographics as possible and while things arn't perfect newer content is usually at least more interesting than vanilla.
---
Read the next line from what I said.
---
For all *we* know, NCSoft could've planned this whole fiasco just because they wanted to promote more merchandising rather than gameplay content.
---
The info we got from the presentation by part of ANet was related to Lore and Gameplay, plus the appearance of the new "saga" (whatever that means, essentially LWS5).
---
The merchandising part is *extremely* out of context to everything else. It felt like it was trying to be a BlizzCon or E3 presentation focused on merchandising (which took almost the same period of time as the rest of the presentation), rather than what we were going to get.
---
I'm not sure how long it takes to set up a paypal account to directly withdraw from your debit card/bank. But you can pay with paypal from that way I believe.
---
I agree.
---
Splitting the fractal lfg in 4 tiers, doesn't help new player at all.
---
Veterans probably like those splits, as the chance to get a total noob is less.
---
However, this system is still bad for the long term of GW2.
---
Imo, they should allow ppl. from lower tiers join higher tiers, as soon as they meet the AR requirement and did around 25 fractals  from their current tier (no  matter in what order).
---
The current system asks the players to play  a fractal level higher of their personal level (or the same)  to increase the personal fractal level, so you are forced to somehow find a team (via lfg?) to complete lvl 25,50 and 70. 
---
And of course, when ppl. from T4 do their recs, they never list their lfg in the t1-t3 section...
---
My tip for new players: Try ton find a guild. This will instantly allow you to play all T4 fractals, even tho your personal fractal level is less. That way you quickly increase your personal fractal level. And maybe you learn some stuff.
---
I was also stuck in t1 - t2 one year ago when i started with gw2. I was lucky that i found a friendly guild who helped me with AR and carried me within the T4s and explained me everything.
---
Now 1 year later, i have 500KP from 100CM and do my cms + T4 in less then 1 hour.
---
My favorite is when people use the excuse "Well if Anet doesn't deliver people will be upset!".
---
Well no shit people will be upset, but ya know what? If Anet had any good will left *people would be way more forgiving*, it's squarely Anet's fault that they're scared to death of roadmaps. That's the issue, Anet has been relying purely on good will for the past 7 years. At some point you need to stop at a damn gas station.
---
&gt; 15k hours 
---
Since GW2 release?
---
Some of the devs are proven to be incompetent. Games are an artform, the people who make the games are artists. Which means criticism usually has to extend to artistic ability in order for it to be effective.
---
Nobody says that the developers are divine. 
---
Management however is probably often fucking things up, by saying "will this increase our revenue?" "no, bu-" "Then fuck off" to many side projects. At least i could imagine, cuz the same developers that brought us Dragonfall also delivered us Long live the lich - and you cannot tell me that without pressure from upper levels they would have released that map in that state. 
---
Also i'm sure many of the skins could have been used for PoF map rewards or something like it, but management said: "you wanna make the players do **what** for that armor skin? doesn't that take you time to develop? just put it in the gemstore."
---
This of course is not an excuse for all bad design decisions, but i think with more freedom the devs would make a much better game.
---
Yes. Throwing money at things will solve all problems.
---
You toss in 10 bucks and a problem goes poof
---
I totally agree, paid lootboxes shouldn't even exist. I like the randomness of them but selling a random chance at getting a good item is just outright dumb.
---
This works when your customer base isn't pissed off.
---
So do you got back to Walmart to cry that the grill you bought six months ago for $200 is now on sale for $150?  These kinds of promotions happen all the time, it is insanely childish to get upset about it.
---
I had all but 2, I didn't buy those in the past 7 years cause they were too ugly to spend cash on... So now I got one for free, and it's still ugly as can be. I like the glider though.
---
I don't need special t-shirts or whatever. I just want MMORPG content: Raids, Dungeons(fracs), Proper open world and PvP in both arena and WvW form.
---
How well does it run in WINE?
---
What I understand (wrong maybe) is that "strikes" are meant to teach us raid bosses mechanics, so i guess they will be like this:
---
Instanced content using the raid bosses with their pre-events, already ingame, with same mechanics, tune down a little, like less HP, less dmg for bosses, no timer but with same rewards, even the legendary ones, some of the AP, not all and no titles. Every raid wing will generate 3 "strikes" so you can pick any raid boss want without any requirements.
---
*sigh*
---
just....**sigh**
---
Bangers and Mash looks kind of cartoonish for Anet's current style but the camera work was pretty on point.  
---
Hopefully they put in a similar caliber of work on the actual Season 5 gameplay
---
* Frisk uses FLIRT
---
Even more unpopular opinion: All the new content should be geared towards people understanding the game and knowing what their skills do and not just the ones who want to play ranger with a long bow on world bosses or minionmancer.
---
I've bought Hot recently but not recently enough :c
---
I added the spoiler tag because I included events from this thread's Bangar cinematic in his bio, and that counts as a spoiler for the Icebrood Saga as it seems to be a cinematic in the upcoming prologue Bound by Blood. :)
---
It's been a while since I've done the charr personal story, so correct me if I'm wrong anywhere. But the way I remember understanding it is like this:
---
Charr tend to maintain distant, vaguely professional relationships with their blood relatives, though some choose to be more or less personal about it. Like in the animal kingdom, one's offspring is still a sign of one's own legacy, and one's ancestry/parents are still a part of one's inherited baggage.
---
For instance, despite all three of the personal story charr fathers being distant, they each have different relationships to the player. The honorless gladium, while never being present in the PC's life, is still associated with the PC's reputation through blood. On the other hand, the loyal soldier, *also not present in the PC's life,* still chooses to leave behind an heirloom for them and wish them the best with their life.
---
So, overall, there's still that loose connection with one's blood, but it varies greatly from one charr to the other.
---
In this instance, I think Bangar points it out to Rytlock purely to spite him. Because really, Bangar might already be in Crecia's pants and fathering Rytlock's son is just another way to twist the knife. Bangar basically took Rytlock's place as Crecia's lover and the father of his son, and acts like he's doing a better job than Rytlock ever could. Fucking *ouch.*
---
So sure, part of it stings because of Rytlock's emotional arc in Requiem, but part of it is just about pride and Rytlock's legacy being taken over by Bangar.
---

Thousands and thousands of customers, silent customers, imagine coming to complaint forum Central or the Reddit and seeing only these posts there's no way that will help them sell the game to new customers so despite the announcement being fine for new clientele angering the current vocal groups with no relevant info that would be expected will hurt sales yet again.
---
Can't remember saying I only play one game. I just said that if you wouldn't play minecraft that much you maybe wouldn't have to lie about your account value now :D

And don't worry I'm not judging minecraft. Hitting a block with leftclick till it disappears seems like a proper task for someone like you.

you can literally modify it by using your muscles

let's watch an instructional video to learn more:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21ZfGPp-Ves
---
The community of said game is very much also topic of this subreddit. It's an MMO, so the communtiy is literally part of the game.
---
And it's great that the more over the top threads of this kind do not get many upvotes, but it is more than a few.
---
Where did you even find it so cheap? Are you sure it's a safe deal? There's some shady websites that can get you banned.
---
I stopped doing them. Now theyre daed xd
---
&gt; LEL which is true not going deny that.
---
For your information I never paid any "raidclear sellers " anything. Matter of facts I am fighting against them in terms of their LFG, joining their squad and troll bit :). Go to your "carefree friends on raidclear sellers to provide you a video or screenshot that I bought one. I dare you :)". so your peaceful mind going be happy LEL.
---
As for Kstyle easy (Korean Style) you can't see it through the letter "K" Style, how outdated you are. :D

Wouldn't be the first to be horny for Joko. There are quite a few fanworks out there of pretty decent quality.

I main firebrand guardian. I don't just heal, but fistribute shields and dmg boosts as well. Also you wear heavy armor, so you won't get rekt like Elementalist do.

I made Rytlock sliders once, the trick is to butter the rolls and get a good charr on them.
---
&gt;So you are of the opinion that OP and anyone who does not share your sentiment to a T
---
Thank you for not even trying to understand.
---
is that 15 fps my eyes
---
What made you think it's not for you? It's not much different compared to a couple of years ago except some additional content.
---
This certainly was a cringy addition to a presentation that had a 44 hour countdown.
---
I do actually. But you seem to be unwilling to accept that some people might not share your outrage.
---
Removing instabilities would be a good start towards people actually playing them again. Not to mention with so many good players leaving for other games, pugging cms has become increasingly frustrating. I just stopped doing them since even 200 ess groups are failing mechanics now.
---
Healing in GW2 is a terrible experience outside of endgame scenarios and to some extent PvP/WvW.  This idea that you're going to heal or that people will work with you to get healed is frustration waiting to happen.  It'll also significantly impede your ability to independently get through the game.
---
for a person who doesn't give a fuck, you give a lot of fucks
---
I'm talking about the majority of people here: if you ask members of each community (casual PvE, hardcore PvE, PvP, WvW), most of them will agree that Living World isn't a great way to deliver content if you could have an expansion instead
---
LOL Call it whatever you want LIE BRO when i asked you for your API KEY you got on the defense side, Why in da fuck I would share my API Key with a peasant like you? *(yikes) sorry didn't mean to insult you. Big yikes.
---
Which version of him are you using / trying to emulate? iirc Some of the characters have gone through transformations beyond just armor (Canach comes to mind)
---
Well damn son
---
There is also the bounty train option ... almost guaranteed that there will be people in need of healing because they don't pay attention to the mechanics
---
Oh I'm sure, I don't actually blame the devs. I blame the management, Anet has learned absolutely nothing since the layoffs and the developer talent is frankly wasted.
---
There is still roadmap from march that still has 2-3 items that need to be delivered.
---
no u
---
already done, also after deleting local.dat. nothing changed
---
Yep i have finished hot a long time ago.
---
The thing is i just am interested in the collection for the skin and not much about the probable lore/story tied to it.
---
I still won't look the optimal route online, it's something i'm gonna do when i just wanna chill (so i will take it slowly)
---
Yeah, I'm personally inclined to continue using the neutral "it" in wiki for the time being, like we've done for many dragons without clearly defined genders so far, until we get an official canon answer about a proper pronoun if such has been decided on by the devs. :)
---
Don't say such things b... BAKA!
---
While your idea is intriguing and totally something I'd be interested to see, I think it would be a bit dishonest for the ANet dev in OP's link to play along with "oh yeah, the voice from the trailer? You mean Jormag's VA?" if it was actually intended to be the DSD and we'd never actually heard Jormag.
---
And how is this relevant to what I've said?
---
Yea your interests some "games", let me guess your basic league of legends since your "PC" can't handle some games. I ain't insulting you bro, it's okay I'll help you out ok?
---
and back to the topic:
---
You didn't PROVIDE YOUR API Key, why should I do it? answer this simple question.
---
Also who said 
---
&gt;Funny hearing that coming from someone too greedy to actually pay sellers to get his raidclears and instead commands in pugs so they can't kick him for his buyer performance :) 
---
I command in pugs cause I am performing good or worse depends on mood, if it's bad I'll just call it a day, and relax, Give credits where credits due. I ain't you and you're not "ME". You never commanded a pug group at all, I was looking into the lfg and you're just farming, not even weekly clear ya. go with your dogshit static that can't win a fricking ERP. omegalul.
---
Paypal is no good either, i get the same error. But i dont actually get to the "log in to your paypal" part, it crashes with that error before that.
---
After Googleing a bit more, previous lore seems to have jormag as genderless, almost always referring to it using either the proper name Jormag or the title the Ice Dragon, so I guess it could work. The same convention holds for all of the spirits of the wild. Kralk's line was the only ones with explicit genders iirc. Given the understanding of the minions though, that type of irony seems thematically out of place. 
---
Although to be fair if we brought back Nolan North again it would be a bit repetitive
---
Yes it was about LS, but idk if you know but LS is not only about story also Mike Z clearly stated that we should expect "xpac content" and we didn't get any info about that, that's why we are angered. Oh so it us that will kill GW2? It's not a company that is literally murdering  PvP and WvW and only giving life support to PvE? That's a good joke buddy.
---
Anet is in USA, and in terms of employee rights it is just a small step up from Africa.
---
thank you for the suggestion
---
Dear diary.
---
Tempest healing is probably the most "fun" healing experience you can have. Plus your elite skill can literally save everyone from death.
---
jackpot.

Maybe the thing, that I started with Elementalist and got overwhelmed and it was my first MMO.

What takes the longest is completing the collections for the first time.
---
Other than the collections, the story instances take little time, as they are 3 single easy fights.
---
To get extra skins, you can either play HoT again and repeat the story and get another one with another character (you'll need to craft another vision crystal, spiritwood scion and orb of natural essence), or get unbound magic in any Season 3 maps and use them to exchange the current Caladbolg for another with a different skin.
---
ive always found these sort of small time creators pretty irresponsible. if he got enough money to live out the rest of his life like some of the more popular streamers/video makers id understand, but from what ive seen he barely gets by, especially since hes from uk. what happens if gw2 does actually die? or youtube goes to shit?
---
&gt; and back to the topic: You didn't PROVIDE YOUR API Key, why should I do it? answer this simple question. 
---
Told you in the other comment already, don't really expect you to actually understand it though.
---
&gt;I command in pugs cause I am performing good or worse depends on mood,  if it's bad I'll just call it a day, and relax,
---
Following that logic you would never raid. But at least there's nine other people not able to kick you so they have to carry you.
---
&gt;You never commanded a pug  group at all, I was looking into the lfg and you're just farming, not  even weekly clear ya.
---
I commanded alot of pugs, but people like you never made it past the first 20% of a boss. Before gifting a kill without payment to a useless scrub like you I make the whole squad gg, kick, block, search for a new guy and go for the wing with competent people. Also I get it sounds strange to you, but if you're not shit at the game, you are able to get your fullclear on monday and don't need a full week.
---
&gt;go with your dogshit static that can't win a  fricking ERP. omegalul.
---
Again such a big mouth for someone who cant even get a power warrior rotation done.
---
&gt; me and my friends are gonna have to record the raw gameplay ourselves
---
That would be terrible! People not delivering your specific request to your doorstep? Doing things yourself? Inconceivable!
---
Technically? Aurene was female. Glint was female. Kralk was male. I think if the established lore was already that all the dragons were basically genderless/sexless beings then I think no one would care. Saying 'non-binary' instead of genderless seems to be a political move. Nothing wrong with the dragon being genderless mind you but the phrasing itself is bound to get people upset due to the socio-political real world implications.
---
I play a full Harrier Renegade with Kalla/Ventari. The synergy, buffing ability, and outright burst heal are what have made me fall in love with the class; it really trivializes most 5 man group content with the exception of very high level and CM fractals where I can’t outheal enemy damage as well. 
---
I run Invocation for the fury (which improves the speed you gain kalla’s fervor and stacks with Brutal Momentum), personal swiftness or unique boon on swap, and extra energy on swap if you manage energy intelligently (not hard on this build.) 
---
I run Salvation because the traitline alone personally gives me a 77% increase in outgoing healing effectiveness (selfless amplification scales off healing power and comes out to 22% for me). Alacrity on your Ventari burst heal skill is indispensable for uptime if you don’t run Righteous Rebel. Also the bonus from life attunement (a minor that gives +120 healing power AND 7% of healing power as concentration) works perfectly for harrier stat gear. 
---
Finally in Renegade, Wrought-Iron Will gives quick regeneration and retaliation. This trait is one of those little but great things about the class. If you’re diligent about dodging the fireballs on the flux anomaly phase of the Skorvald fight, you’re rewarded with the perfect amount of regeneration that drops your party fully capped off at the next island. Endless Enmity is great for personal fury uptime but isn’t as amazing as some of revenant’s other minor traits. All for one could be better if it had a longer base protection uptime, but with my build I’m seeing a &gt;60% uptime; it’s not as consistent as herald but it’s nice to have the damage reduction on my party while I have Kalla summons out. The grandmaster is a difficult choice between effortlessly replacing a Druid’s might output for 5 man content or being the best single source of alacrity in the entire game.  I played chrono for long enough that I’m happy to take the easy way out and get alacrity with one key press, but I do switch to the might machine when my party needs it.
---
I concur with the popular sentiment that unique buffs like spirits and banners are indispensable in organized, optimal runs. However, for T3 Fractal pug runs and below having a super competent source of healing, might, alacrity, and sometimes protection/regeneration changes the entire dynamic of the run if everyone else is already pulling their weight damage-wise.
---
Couple things I’ve learned from mainly playing this class in t2 and t3 pugs:
---
-Staff 5 slaughters breakbars and brings Kalla stacks to 5 for heroic command. If all hits connect (120*9) it does 1,080 instant breakbar damage.
---
-staff aa3, staff 2, and staff 4 are all good gap heals
---
-staff aa3 is a whirl finisher and staff 4 is a blast finisher. Whirling or blasting your tablet’s field cleanses conditions. Try to blast fire fields with staff 4 and tablet elite at low energy for long duration stacks of might.
---
-Sword 2&amp;4 are good soft CC skills if you have nothing else. Chill is mostly unique to revenant so it’ll add to breakbar damage rather that imob which everyone has (if it’s already on the target it will just stack in duration).
---
-get used to auto-attacking because your energy is a valuable resource that is already being allocated to buffing, healing, and cleansing.
---
-if stunned in Kalla and the enemy has a breakbar up Darkrazor is a stunbreak and good CC. Otherwise orders from above and heroic command are instant cast so try to drain your energy with those and then swap legends to stunbreak and refill energy. If stunned in Ventari you can still freely use your tablet and all your heals so it isn’t as big of a deal; however if your team is about to wipe: you can use protective solace (mobile projectile hate/light field) into energy expulsion to cleanse several conditions in an area, leave behind healing fragments, and reduce your energy to 0 to legend swap and stunbreak.
---
-Soucleave summit scales off the renegade’s power (harrier is a power major 3-stat yay)
---
-your skill to move your tablet is a really good heal on a 5a cooldown. With your perma-alacrity that becomes a 3s cooldown.
---
-natural harmony can completely refill a health bar at 1% in two pulses
---
-protective solace is the ultimate projectile hate skill. It used to be the ultimate cheese on the Molten Furnace fractal testing chamber section, but still helps now and can be indispensable in the open world.
---
-Kalla’s Fervor stacks on critical hit so diviner builds win out in that respect. However rev is luckier than most harrier builds because his passive, brutal momentum, gives a base 33% additive crit chance when he has a full endurance bar. Base(5%) + fury(20%) + brutal momentum(33%) + 5 stack mist offensive potion with 150ar(15%) = 73% crit chance. Not too bad for a character with zero points geared into precision.
---
-With Heroic Command traited you give 18s of alacrity to 10 people on a 15s (with alacrity) cooldown. The drawback is you’ll only consistently give out 10 stacks of might in conjuncture. 
---
-with lasting legacy traited all you have to do is use profession skill 2 off cooldown to give your party 25 might permanently. The drawback is you’ll probably drop perfect party alacrity if you don’t spam natural harmony in Ventari (which limits you to a more rigid rotation).
---
-you get 77% healing effectiveness from salvation, 10% from sigils, 20% from runes, and 10% from food. Your heals are 117% stronger for allies. I’m getting 8k-12k single natural harmony healing bursts.
---
-in order to get the full bonus from charged mists you wanna be &lt;10 energy when you legend swap. Letting soulcleave run out your energy in Kalla and using energy expulsion in Ventari should both land you below 10 extremely quickly. More often than not revenant’s energy problem will land you below 10 energy before you need to worry about it, but I find myself being be able lock energy gain with upkeep skills and swap with 75 energy at my disposal.
---
-food and utility items are used to increase healing while also capping concentration to the necessary amount (~96% boon duration) for natural harmony to give the full 4s of alacrity.
---
WARNING: This build doesn’t really do damage. Power builds NEED ferocity just like condition builds NEED expertise to really be effective. Renegade, unfortunately, suffers from the affliction that all of its boons are low base duration and all of its healing power comes from outgoing healing modifiers. You need your party to kill stuff more than your party needs you to keep them alive most of the time. Still damn I’ve never had so much fun nor played as effective of a support class. Also yeah it’s kinda overkill, but overkill is fun.

I understood that strikes were their own things, i.e. the first strike is some ice guy and it seems not related to raids ( i didnt do the more recent wings so maybe im wrong). But both way it could be nice!

The game is on life-support. So I suppose it will be dead even if it isn't quite yet.

I hope this is sarcasm.
---
I swear I’ve seen icons before. I thought they were old and unused?
---
Not from Anet because I have no faith in them being able to justify the subfee.
---
I do it for FFXIV because their team justifies it, Anet wouldn't even be able to justify 1 dollar a month.
---
GW2 lives and dies by it's market niche, it's always competing with the big sub MMOs and the low cost of entry is it's only huge advantage. You take that away, and GW2 has nothing to pull new and old players away from the likes of FFXIV's newest expansion ( or one of the thousands of f2p games).
---
Also, if you don't think Anet makes enough money from the Gem Store to put out more content, you're delusional. There's a reason even sub MMOs have cash shops now. The problem isn't money, and the problem isn't the dev team, the problem is Anet's management has learned absolutely nothing and wasting talent and money.

You take the useless mob, you put it in an instance and done.

Male and female vocal ranges have a fair bit of overlap and voices working in that range can wind up being heard either way depending on which other cues a listener has to go on (like voice bearing and knowledge/expectations about the character being voiced).

Now they do a big reveal event and our questions "affect the script" and then we get silence.

They know we got questions for them they won't be comfortable to answer so they're avoiding us.
---
Yeah, if I don't play PvP because it's a dead unsupported mode I'll surely be playing WvW. Same story as PvP, I got the backpack and never touched this shitmode again.
---
Scarlet was a walking joke, as was Joko. Caudecus was turned into a babbling imbecile, and Faolain was wasted in the worst possible way. Both Gaheron and Kudu were underdeveloped and died too soon.

Bangar is smart, and could be the first real villain that represents an actual mortal threat.
---
ShB raids are fantastic! The story of ShB caused me to weep gloriously many times. Better than GW2 raids? I GUESS, but it’s different. Current raids actually feel difficult due to them being punishing. They’re approachable enough that anyone could get in (same as GW2), you can get in with less than optimal gear (same as GW2), earn better gear (same as GW2), but, unlike GW2, they stay challenging until newer things come out, and the challenge remains with the new things. That’s mostly vertical progression, but the fact is it doesn’t step backwards, it goes forwards. It doesn’t go: nice, okay, alright, super easy, hard, okay, super easy.
---
New monster discussed in the stream with the upcoming maps. Supposedly going to be following in the trend of Lovecraftian horror. They said it'll set traps, be able to throw its voice so you don't actually know where it is. The kind of thing, as they put it, that will keep you looking over your shoulder as you explore.
---
I noticed the image they used during the livestream announcement (on the right) was different than the one they used in the blog post announcement (on the left), despite using the same base.
---
Just interesting to me. Wanted to hear people's ideas on the design, I guess.
---
Did you reinstall the audio driver?  Does game audio work if you redirect to another output (try plugging HDMI into a TV and playing audio through it)?
---
Also, try turning off "Fast Startup" in the Windows&gt;Control Panel&gt;Power Options&gt;System Settings menu.  It can prevent your system from fully resetting when powering down.
---
I don't record with any audio as by default OBS records my discord window and won't split the audio (it's a tad annoying to fix and the ingame audio doesn't add much). So i'd rather just upload my benchmarks/boss kills without random discord banter and just put some random instrumental music instead. Also personally I always enjoy watching boss kills and seeing what music the player likes.
---
Okay question for you do you have "full infusion on your gear?"
---
You can tell it's really bad when even the most ardent defenders of the company are starting to speak against it, lmao.
---
which server you're at? :)?
---
k, seems like going for the decaying wendigo aesthetic, the only noticeable difference is the shape of the animal skull (one being a deer and the other being wolf) which i don't think makes much of a difference, like if those 2 were different skins you could buy for something i'd call it a low effort money grab
---
ahahaha you wanna blame the 15k difference on infusions?
---
[Sorry mate, you are wrong there. ](https://youtu.be/hA6vRTFU6JI) They did mention it actually before gw1 prophecies even was fully out. The first game’s base game’s trailer even mentioned “the guild wars” when the trailer character was a child.
---
All of this crying (about hot becoming free if you buy pof) reminds me of players complaining about me joining game after it went into f2p mode and telling me that i did not deserved to be there cuz i havent payed for that ;D

Joko is the same as Mordremoth and male human pc. :)

Can we not trivialize abusive relationships because you want to be funny online? I hated the announcement, anet is disappointing but this ain't it chief.

The Problem with rytlock is that he does not have unique body sliders, he has a unique face and hair so you can´t really recreate him

Molten Furnace is better than before except for the endboss though. Would be much better if he wouldn't become invulnerable every 3sec.

Didn’t they say the appearance (and mechanics) will evolve with additional episodes ? Maybe it’s that

why is this so accurate?

Drakkar is going to be a world boss in episode 2 in the new seas...saga.
---
Imagine basing your view of the game on the drama of its subreddit, while knowing nothing about the context outside that people are disappointed.
---
We all knew LW5 was coming. While there was a chance, it was never confirmed or even hinted that LW5 would be the slices of an expansion-size pie. Yet here we are, disappointed people being disappointed, and here you are, blaming marketing instead.
---
Admittedly, that countdown background *did* look a bit like a row of 9 characters, but honestly, people simply gave themselves too much speculation-based hype.
---
A full set of gear costs less than 30g. How is this gold intensive? You can farm this in half a day when you start from 0.
---
&gt;My favorite is when people use the excuse "Well if Anet doesn't deliver people will be upset!". 
---
I think that ArenaNet is way past that now, they stuck with this excuse for so long that basically everything except for the story has been scrapped. This game is so mismanaged that the "no talk until is done" turned into scrapping everything and delivering only comfort-zone bs that they used statistics to believe everyone likes, such as the story chapters. I believe the reason they don't release a roadmap is because they have no idea what they are supposed to be doing. They just ignore everything that had some kind of backlash and try to stick with what "worked" or new ideas, which leads us to the content we have today and the introduction of stuff like novelties.
---
I like the Idea of your 10 man strike team having to hunt it down and trying to listen carefully to where its location is
---
This was supposed to be the case for all Elder Dragons. Forces of nature, not a thing with gender. Obviously it became more important when they gave Mordremoth and Kralkatorrik VAs, suddenly gender mattered. I think the first character to gender an Elder Dragon was Taimi when she called Mordremoth a he. Up until that point most of the community was refering to Elder Dragons as they.
---
It's going to be so cringe if S5 is going to make a big deal out of gender. We literally have ice zombies and a world ending dragon, it will be really silly to have a bunch of sexism plot to trudge through. Both the Sons of Svanir and the female norn have _much_ bigger things to worry about than whether the Sons of Svanir will let girls into their club.
---
people try to shift the blame onto ncsoft all the time because of past grievances but the reality is anet is just incompetent and greedy, they are responsible for the layoffs, not ncsoft. ncsoft were just doing what anet should have been doing for the last 3 years; their job.

Looks like a Chinese Scar rip off honestly.

pretty much every game uses that statistic though, not just gw2.

There are actually some nice things in there.

I like the Wreath of Cooperation and the last 3 masks.
---
Instead of just nerfing Coalescence of Ruin 3rd Impact damage in WvW they're going to nerf the entire skill for every other gamemode.  Awesome.
---
Idk, man. Maybe you should, like, totally Google it or something, man.
---
For me personally Fractals are in the same category as Dungeons. They are too old. No amount of instabilities or minor reworks are going to bring be back permanently. I just did them too much. I often try the new one on release but one every few months is not going to change my opinion. But I'm sure new players and some veterans might still love doing them.
---
probably melted after people realised that the big new announcement was just another LS season lmao
---
I vaguely recall seeing something like back when ascended gear first came out, I don't have a link though unfortunately.
---
That would be cool! Probably would be easier to program it as an encounter like that rather than some free-roaming mob. Though a free-roaming mob would, if programmed well, add a better layer of suspense to the open world. And I think that kind of atmosphere is sorely needed.

I was disappointed by the announcement as well. I wanted something more than just more story. I just don't get this though.

Why do you guys treat a gaming company more seriously than you would a politician? They are making a game, not laws that govern your lives. The burden of accessibility just isn't there for a video game developer, it's a completely unrealistic expectation.

I get people want answers (many just want to jab ArenaNet with pitchforks) but you guys are acting like you want to put ArenaNet on trial or something.

Love this, but I have no idea what's up with Drakkar. I guess it makes sense; they said "Drakkar" like it was supposed to be a crowd-pleaser but only a couple people cheered, which shows how many Guild Wars veterans are left. So it's not a big deal if they just...totally revamp his design, I guess, because it's not like many people are going to notice.
---
[But they should hardly need concepting considering they had a fully-realized model in the original game](http://mikeabundo.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/drakkar.jpg)
---
Now suddenly he looks like...[this?](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/d/db/Drakkar_concept_art.jpg)
---
It's really baffling to me. They did this with Primordus too, which a lot of people tried to justify by saying Elder dragons change evolve or whatever. Which, okay, if that's how you want to play it off sure. But this dude looks nothing like the original Drakkar. They did a really great job in the initial stages of GW2's release translating GW1 enemies to an updated game (Oakhearts, Ettins, etc). But in the last few years they've just kind of thrown out a lot of what they established. Maybe part of it is that he originally looked like an underwater boss, but Anet hasn't done anything about underwater combat in years so they just have to go back to the drawing board. Really sad.
---
How is that any different from vertical progression? How can all that same stuff not apply to any game with iLvLs?
---
XIV used to be my main MMO and people would bitch about how casual it was too. Just having vertical progression isn't the solution, because it inherently doesn't solve anything. Once you hit the iLvL requirement, the balance becomes exactly like games that don't have vertical progression. Sure, eventually you'll be able to out level the content to such an extent that it all becomes something you can solo, but that content becomes way past irrelevant by the time that happens, giving you no reason to do it even well before you become strong enough to solo it.
---
Our content is true repeatable content. Each and every thing implemented in this game gives relevant rewards. You don't need to have wing 7 on farm to get ascended gear, money, legendaries, or whatever. Content in this game doesn't become irrelevant. That's not to say that you personally will enjoy it, but it is true repeatable content.
---
Metrics are cool, but the forums and reddit generate the public image, it's where the conerstones of community spend their time and they can be doing free advertising if you play your cards right
---
Like dota 2, it's basically only marketed on steam because it costs valve nothing, I have not seen any ads for the game in years, save for the international, but the community itself is a huge marketing tool
---
Ill be honest...I'm also super excited for strikes.  I've been raiding every wing, every week, 1-2 times a week, since Spirit vale came out, and I am so burned out of recruiting new people when others leave the game, and running the content over and over for no reason (once you get the AP/skins there really is no point IN MY OPINION anymore). I've got 3 sets of leg armor, I'm sitting at 21,000 gold so raiding has become a thing to do just so I still have a static for the next wing that comes out in 10 months.
---
If strike missions came out on a consistent basis and had some skins and AP attached to each one I would totally take that over the current model of raids.
---
So where is the abuse in what you described? Did he hurt you physically? Shout mean things at you? Belittle you so you lose your self-esteem and cling to him? Doing not enough does not make a relationship abusive, especially when promises, as underwhelming as they are, are fulfilled.
---
Maybe you should just learn to appreciate that he is still around for you. Or maybe you should let him find another partner that he will be able to make happy.
---
Also, ArenaNet is not you friend. Nor your boyfriend. Playing another game is not cheating on him. Go do that and come back when you can use the game, it'll stay around so you can use it and it won't mind it because it has no mind.

&gt;The same convention holds for all of the spirits of the wild.

---
I think their biggest issue is they have too much on their plate with only the resources to manage one thing. If they cut the bull and discarded WvW and PvP completely, they might have a fighting chance since they put so many eggs in the PvE basket. Either that or they need to charge a sub which won't go over well until the game's worthy of having a sub, but it'll never get that worthy unless they can lock subs. Catch 22 shit. 
---
Their narrative and art teams are without a doubt their biggest asset. I really hope LS5 proves that the game's story and open world is enough to keep it going. The pessimist in me doesn't think so but the optimist is at least hopeful because I'm definitely their target audience.
---
If I learned anything about raiders visiting this sub, your request will backfire at you in proper fashion :D
---
Gaile Gray, beloved by all (who are not banned).
---
What they could have done would be the following.  
---
* We planed x episodes for this ~~season~~saga. After that an expansion is planed.
---
* We work hard on the WvW update currently looking into this and that. Same for WvW.
---
* Build templates coming soon, here a short view on it but still work in progress.
---
* The new season will have new armors/weapons/home instance upgrades/what ever.
---
Nothing specific but still information.
---
I have more the feeling they have maybe ep2, max ep3 planed and nothing beyond. Not even the rough story.
---
I don't disagree with you, but I'm thinking of this as a new consumer. It's not uncommon the look up recent reviews of games and the top two places to see those is the gw2 forums and here. I do think the hype was a bit high and given the panel was for living world we shouldn't have expected much else but this has been a building problem through lack of communication on what's coming up otherwise or what direction the games taking. This eventually led to the speartip that is the current "drama" but when the full vocal community screams abandon ship due to that while your reviewing the game would you really feel the incentive to buy that game?
---
i think it's less laziness and more "why waste time on something that doesn't matter?"
---
also elder dragons and dragons aren't the same thing
---
&gt; non binary identity
---
&gt; ideological
---
???
---
Current story gets done in hours anyway and 3-4 weeks is more than what we currently have. Players cant complain that there's nothing to do if there's constant updates about lore as well as constant raid difficulty bosses. I just dont see the point of wasting months and months on making maps that are only relevant for lore and almost nothing else.
---
SW and DT had a lot bigger value before HoT than most of ls3/4 maps have now.
---
People who play those modes are paying just as much as anyone else so idk how that's relevant.
---
The only thing I got from that was by rebranding it away from "Living Story" where players expect a new patch every 3-4 months, they can change when, how and what they release. I didn't pay much attention to be honest, but I did catch parts where they were saying content releases *may* happen more regularly, but wouldn't be full LS-like patches, just whatever they were working on and was ready. So it's unlikely that there will be any more big patches at fairly regular intervals, and just bits here and there.
---
I really enjoyed the ascended cooking update.  It was a pretty cool side quest (and I love the third garden plot) and just reminds me how sad I am this game doesn't have side quests and instead wasted all that dev time on heart quests instead.
---
Seems like Extreme trials from FFXIV, which is well-liked content
---
...That was very blatantly Jormag in the narration.
---
Three question marks does not a dispute make. Apologies for the generalization, but your crowd would be a lot less  repellent if your language or style of posting wasn't so caked with a nature of sarcasm or percieved superiority.
---
We don't treat them more seriously. We just complain louder because we can't vote for a cheeto to run ANet for a while.
---
to be honest I have no idea how to use one xD
---
Why are they punching each other with closed fists when their fingers end in 3 inch claws?
---
&gt; They did a really great job in the initial stages of GW2's release translating GW1 enemies to an updated game (Oakhearts, Ettins, etc).
---
Most, if not all, of the devs that did that are gone. Newer devs reinventing the wheel isn't surprising.
---
It is a big deal, just doing a quick search you will find out that 90% of the free playerbase drops the game halfway after realizing this.  Either way it is irrelevant for me to keep arguing about this game, I’ve moved to echo of souls, while the story may not be superior, the gameplay is fun and there’s a free account mount from the start, just as any other free to play MMO. Truly a shame.
---
Get a new job... No different than switching any other career.
---
&gt; I really love the idea of healing and be the GOD of saving people from death.
---
GW2 isn't the game for you. The entire game is designed specifically to make your desired specialty irrelevant.
---
The ones that yell snowflakes the loudest are always the true snowflakes, really.
---
Oh I see. Thanks for the correction, thought they were traitlines.
---
Then you only have worked in specific jobs.
---
And in your world I wouldn't want to do a road map ever
---
They are a gateway into raids.
---
I never, ever, want to experience GW2 with it's current engine in VR.
---
That's just....
---
No, god, I like not having a migraine and feeling sick.
---
I think they're legitimately scared of the community. Rather than trying to be a *part* of the community of the game they created and are working on, they isolate themselves and cut off all contact. They tried to do those Q&amp;As after release on Reddit, and they went really well, until we learned what they really think of the fans lol. They aren't going to change after all this time, and it will be their undoing as this whole debacle is proving.
---
Was more excited waiting for this than watching the stream
---
At this point in time?
---
Black Desert \[even more now with the console releases\], Tera, ESO especially. Even on Twitch, GW2 doesn't break 1k viewers.
---
Why should you achieve the same rewards as someone who completes harder content than you? There are 1000s of rewards in the game, you can live without a few skins if you don't think they're worth the effort
---
Well you havent seen a single strike yet, who is to say that this must be a bad decision?
---
Raids have a lot of flaws and the raid community doesnt make it easy for people to get into raids either.
---
Its a good idea to reduce the group size needed for high end content. And take away all unnecessary barriers for lategame content that arent directly related to the skill of playing the game.
---
The whole Boneskinner giving away Wendigo vibes and the fact that trailer showcased centaurs leading human slaves through a dense forest makes me believe we'll delve into Woodland Cascades finally.
---
Whatever Drama Queen!!!
---
The raids are already easy, especially the Hot ones due to the power creep that came with PoF. 99%of the content is already easy mode.
---
At least HoT definitely kept me busy for a long time. There are only a handful things left I still want to do in HoT besides just doing the metals, but HoT gave me plenty of content and enjoyment way past its release date. Just every now and then going back to it, doing a few more achievements and collections. Getting gold on another adventure.  
---
Though maybe I am in the minority on this one.
---
if she didn't use it as an excuse to disqualify all criticism, sure. look, it's actually incredibly easy:
---
I understand people are upset about the current situation but please refrain from attacking anyone personally, it doesn't help your arguments and only escalates the situation.
---
and done. would've probably even fit in a single tweet.
---
what she did was focus all attention on the relatively few toxic people, by dredging up the worst she could find, as if that's all there is. I agree with the message, but the delivery is intended to elicit sympathy for the devs and undermining the valid criticism (edit: or at least that's the effect, whether intended or not. just look at the replies)
---
Yes and what about people that start after that you muppet?
---
What higher chance? In the history of the freaking game they've yet to add new weapons to class that can't use them that aren't bound to an elite spec.
---
Nah I keep sub'd to find out when events are happening, which is what I show up for.  But good weak ass attempt at ironic echo.
---
&gt;Three question marks does not a dispute make.
---
i don't understand how being non-binary is dispute or smth
---
&gt;Apologies for the generalization, but your crowd
---
no idea what crowd you mean, im 1 person on the internet
---
They aren't the ones bitching on here lmao
---
Easy. Less useless merchandise, more actual game, mechanics, etc
---
GW2 forums mods are perhaps the most power drunk mods I have ever seen on any online game I have ever played, and im VERY active in all forums of games I play.....
---
That and the fact that you can't downvote, or disagree with anyone without it being a "personal attack" (even if it was just an objective observation and rebuke) speaks volumes to how *kitten* their forum is.
---
**edit:**
---
What hurts me the most about all this, is that they drove people away from their forums by being THAT restrictive, and instead all they did is guide those people to a forum they can't moderate (reddit, unless mods are somehow complaint with the devs, but Im hoping they have more integrity than that). 
---
Now, new players come here and see all this negativity after we got that much publicity on twitch, and it back-shooting on Anet. People usually dont visit game forums due to having to create accounts and/or having to buy the game to use the forums, which is why Bliz and LoL forums are absolute cestpools but their subreddits are "acceptable" by comparison.
---
That's not what an incel is though.
---
Sure enough, im not the knight of ethic in shining armor, but you understand i am not looking to buy gems "cheaper". I am locked out of the conventional options and i ended up look at these websites as a last resort. Price was never a factor. Also, not sure how lootboxes came into this conversation.
---
8 months is regular to you? God that's horrible.
---
Well then, you're a hypocrite. Thanks for playing.
---
Wow, that's insane. I wonder if knowing the context would make this sound any better.
---
The difference is, vertical progression doesn’t hide behind the idea of “get better at your class”, it’s clearly “get better level/armor”. Horizontal progression says “once you get best in slot, only thing better is better playing”. Which, is true. For someone like me, I have legend in (almost) everything (missing runes/sigil/vision/coalescence). I never have to gear again.  All that’s left for me, is to get better. However, on the classes I play, I’ve hit the ceiling on those classes now. What’s left after that? There’s nothing challenging now, and with the current difficulty level, and things getting easier, there is no “progression” only “stagnation”, as my player skill isn’t put into check with new content. If my skills don’t get challenged, it’s not progression.
---
With a vertical progression game, I just have to wait for next armor set. With horizontal, I have to hope the next area/expac is harder. Since the style of “current” end game difficult content is basically: “nice, good, okay, easy as pie, good challenge, okay, easy as pie.” and things going easier, it’s backwards movement for me and others like me. 
---
This is where it’s different. Horizontal isn’t challenging enough with each release, to continue testing my skills. Where vertical has the added benefit of replacing things and always working towards higher and higher (even though rotation imo is pretty easy in those games).
---
That_Shaman thinks they are 100% new. We only have Yellow Hero Points icons by the moment. Original Hero Points icons had blue color too, but different shape.
---
Careful, he's a hero
---
Yes, the vendor is still in Lion's Arch
---
You should see the Path of Exile forums.
---
Dark horse are a comic company, you can get their products in any country through your local comic book shop. They get a catalogue every month that has the releases 3 months ahead in that they can order off, it'll be in that closer to the time. Find your nearest shop and go ask them for a pre-order. Or websites of comic shop companies will have preorders nearer to the time. UK people, forbidden planet is a good place to try. I imagine many places exist in the EU as well.
---
Anything dark horse that's a new release you shouldn't have any trouble getting in UK/EU, no need to import it :)
---
How are you making 60g a day?? :0 I'm a returning player and I feel like I'm struggling to make gold
---
They think they can save their dying game by sweeping shit under the rug instead of just being honest, its why faith in them declines in massive chunks every fuck up they make.
---
Well free HoT with PoF made me come back, since I only had PoF. But honestly don't really know how long will that last. Gonna try some new specs, check out the new living story, do the whole HoT stuff and back to the same old I guess.
---
Sorry, for bothering you with my post. If I'll ever feel the urge to create a napkin doodle you're the first person to know.
---
orbiters lmao
---
It's TRUE though. It feels very uninteresting. I love casual content but I need difficult content aswell. I don't want to play vale gaurdian for the rest of the games life :c.
---
I prefer the one on the right. The one of the left looks less coherent.
---
They have nothing else.
---
I don't know if you've worked in software, but generally the people doing most of the coding don't make those decisions. They get designs and specs from other people and implement it, whether they agree with it or not.
---
Even the design team doesn't have full freedom, they still have to fit the vision of someone higher up.
---
Am I? I'm playing the game exactly as much as I want.  If the devs literally never patched thr game again, I'd be fine.  Ya'll are like "this 6 year old game f2p isn't getting enough content, riot"
---
&gt; In the PR and Marketing world
---
You don't rent out a theater for a massive announcement and deliver essentially nothing. Sure companies play it safe but usually they don't try to oversell their product and hype up expectations and leave you with 0. Additionally you wouldnt waste someone's time with your Vod on youtube with 30 minutes+ of fucking dead air.
---
When has Anet *ever* added entirely new weapons? All they do is grab from the pool of existing ones for Elite specs. It's kind of hard to have a higher chance of something that has never happened.
---
I do think the one on the right gives off some real GW1 vibes, which is cool. I think the less coherent style of the left one gives it a real creep factor that the right one is missing, though. Idk, both have their strengths.
---
Thank you :) I'll try to push the orange colors a bit more to make it feel a bit more like autumn weather.
---
i had very low bar (any news about fractals or raids)
---
new cm fractal, any new rewards
---
Yes you are. You say to someone dissatisfied with the game to leave, while when you are expressing your dissatisfaction with comment section, you refuse leaving the sub.
---
Btw the game is b2p, with f2p core part.
---
&gt;One boss every 3 months is better than 3 a year.
---
Minus everythng that makes raids - raids. Enviroment, lore, non-boss encounters, arching story, side npc and details.
---
So even if strikes were as good as individual raid bossfights (and they won't be), it would be still a downgrade. Honestly, if a-net wanted to space out their raid releases more evenly, they could have released raids in parts one boss of the time, that wouldn't be a problem, since often those are in isolated parts of the instance, we never got a "real" huge sprawling non-linear raid ever.
---
Maybe this even was the idea with w1-3, when "6 wings per year" was a thing, before they drastically downscaled raid developement in favor of... something?
---
the whole non-binary thing comes from left wing identity politics and most ppl outside of those that subscribe to said ideology either don't care about it or think it's pretentious BS.
---
Voice does define gender when applied to something not human,or of unknown gender. If you are trying to tell me Jormag modifies her voice to catfish horny Svanir into following her,then we have a problem.
---
Very constructive. Much criticism.
---
They usually have the season trailer and then the week before the episode we'll have an episode trailer. Since this technically isn't an episode, they may forgo the trailer. I guess we'll see on the 10th? I'd personally like a trailer since its supposed to be a party and a new map and everything.
---
If it's an outfit it will be in the gemstore. Period. But we were talking about armor.
---
It's sad that for AT LEAST a year I will probably get no jew challenging content in gw2.
---
they just wanted to avoid a situation like "You guys Do not Have Phones??" because they knew people were comming after them
---
Trenchcoat not trench code
---
but that's like saying the earth is flat.
---
non-binary people exist everywhere in the world regardless of their political beliefs. thinking it's some left-wing agenda is a weird conspiracy theory
---
what left wing does is trying to be inclusive towards these ppl, so they aren't called "pretentious BS" by other people like you
---
Okay well I don't agree with your logic, and your opinion doesn't matter to anyone. So go cry on the internet into your echo chamber.
---
You're kind of right. Horizontal progression in PvE is boring. And not engaging at all. That's why they're doing new game modes over and over again. To try to interest people with something new. Dungeons -&gt; Guild Missions -&gt; Fractals -&gt; Raids. And now Special Missions. Who knows what will be next.
---
You're still knowingly benefiting from fraud, saying you tried to do the right thing but chose to do the wrong thing when the right thing was hard doesn't excuse you. You do you, but it still makes you an asshole knowingly going into that transaction.
---
Elite specializations, that would have been enough.
---
Likewise, hypocrite.
---
This is what I use. Love it
---
Until sometime in September.
---
The 10th, I believe.
---
/r/gamingcirclejerk
---
Definitely would have been better...  I especially like how some of the free-skin-choices are actually sneaky ploys to get you to buy/spend more gems.  
---
Like, you’re not going to take the lawless gloves and not want the rest of the set.

 **5.Low-effort/-value post**

Low effort/value posts that don't bring any value as a topic to the subreddit. These also include posts that reply to a topic on another thread that could just have been a comment on that topic.

I wish this would actually be applied to stop shit like this thread. If a half-baked drawing isn't low effort, then what the fuck is.
---
VR is still in its kiddie shoes, GW2 wont be released for VR, GW3 has a higher chance to be released in VR.
---
Not sure how other MMO's will deal with VR if gets popular and advanced enough, like wow and other popular MMO's

If you log off there will be one idiot less in ranked. Baby steps!
---
&gt; You can live with a fantasy world where anything can happen
---
And yet somehow despite "anything being able to happen" every fantasy world to come out in the past decade has been a neoliberal multicultural multiracial society of love, tolerance and equality. 
---
I thought the whole point of fantasy was to explore different unique worlds and different cultures with their own viewpoints, but most writers just project their ideal vision of a perfect society based on contemporary politics instead of trying to create intresting worlds with nuanced conflicts.
---
The only two factions in the game to come close to even breaking that mold, icebrood and flame legion, were writen out of the story for the past 7 years and had their respective ideologies be flatter than oil on a pan because nobody wants to make an actually moraly grey villain with verboden nono viewpoint.
---
Writing in gw2 has never been that good or impressive, but lately it has been going on what is generally a downwards spiral, so I wouldn't put it out their reach to make jormag female or something along those lines just to spite le ebul seksists because yas kween slay or an equally asinine reason.
---
Nah instances are "scary" and "not-casual-friendly."
---
They had to show something, that would be my guess. He's not finished but they couldn't just talk about it on the presentation without giving us any visual proof, so they showed us whatever they had at that moment. His pic isn't even up on the new blog post xD
---
The map icon for the NPC got changed to the regular stack of coins merchant icon.
---
Even if they are no longer around you should keep the marks for when the event comes back around anyway.
---
Considering the writting quality lately has been that of 14 year old girls writing fanfics on tumblr, you shouldn't be surprised.
---
Imagine thinking that having a cogent position regarding gender politics constitutes an ideology and not just unbiased observation of real human beings
---
i'm more in the "don't care" camp, it's more that i don't like identity politics and that ppl who subscribe to it (or at least the loudest part of said community) think themselves so important that downright toxic behavior is justified for "the cause" and everybody that disagrees is evil dumb dumb nazi.
---
I'd have to actually log in, might be a a good while.
---
The elder dragon should have said nani?
---
&gt; if not play your shit alone
---
Okay. Bye.
---
&gt; What do you think Anet could have done to have lived up with the hype they created?
---
- Not build as much hype. When you bring out the expansion announcement format, you can't be surprised people expect an expansion announcement. 
---
- Stop giving announcements of future announcements for things you announced previously. "Guild alliances are coming sometime in the near future" is where we were going into the announcement and where we were coming out of the talk, so it doesn't count as something worth announcing.
---
- Demo the actual features. I don't mean have someone switch weapons while the level-up animation plays. Show a rough mock-up of the UI so we can see that it's actually happening and maybe even offer feedback before something broken and unusable debuts.
---
- If you don't have actual dates, give rough estimates. "Q4 2019" or "Q1 2020" gives you plenty of time to play around with the actual release. If you're so far off from finishing that you can't even guess what quarter it'll drop in, don't announce it.
---
- Talk about how new things fit in with the old things. Are strike missions raid replacements or are they stepping stones to the actual raids?
---
expansion level features.

&gt; Is it?
---
&gt;Regarding moving from Season 4 to Season 5, we announced this in the 6th Anniversary Celebration Video. We talked about wanting to release expansion level stories and features over the next couple years. Our goal is to create powerful moments like the final instance of this episode that are a culmination of multiple departments and raise the bar for what it means to be a Guild Wars 2 experience.
---
there is no context. I said a few patches ago i was disappointed with the amount of content being released and that there was too much of a focus on living world and i got banned. the forum moderation is just absolutely asinine.
---
I don't have any links, but the vitriol around Ascended Gear was very real.
---
he's probably gay and would like to refer as a female
---
let me explain since my original comment may be a bit confusing:
---
voice doesn't define gender identity, but the resonance of a voice can be attributed to sex (thin/thick vocal cords cuz of testosterone or lack of) 
---
but then you get the overlap spectrum in which cis women can sound like guys, cis guys can sound like girls, both can sound androgynous. you can also meet intersex people who are even more unambiguous.
---
&gt; If you are trying to tell me Jormag modifies her voice to catfish horny Svanir into following her,then we have a problem.
---
i have a problem with this sentence, you wrote it in response to a voice lesson for trans women, implying it's purpose is to catfish horny men. it's inherently transphobic
---
They do not want to play SB because it sucks major dong.
---
Reaper is only good if your team sucks arse. The more competent a team is,the less useful a Reaper is.
---
Scourge only has epidemic and barriers. The rest of his kit is about as useful as Logan during Story Mode.
---
Wildstar was garbage at launch. It went in to death spiral before most of the hardcore players even got to raids.
---
That content is only good if you dont care at all about progressing through difficult content. The two most dominant MMOs are at their position because they retain that casually hardcore playerbase (2-3 nights a week of raiding). GW2 doesn't have that at all, because all you get rewarded with are horizontal upgrades to your appearance.
---
Twitch viewers don't determine the success of a given game.... Revenue does and GW2's revenue is still in the top 5 MMOs last I checked
---
Yeah, i know that, but whole point of GW1 was pvp with GvG at it's center...
---
Kralk calls Aurene "child of my child". He is her grandfather. Kralk calls for his mother. If they have a concept of father and mother... how can they be genderless if they have different gender name for the same concept (a parent)?
---
Kralkatorrik and Vlast are clearly males, referred to as "he". Glint and Aurene females, referred to as "she".
---
You say Elder Dragons and dragons are not the same thing, yet a dragon is an offspring of an Elder Dragon and  a dragon can become an Elder Dragon - so the difference is really just in how much magic they contain within. And if they started as dragons and had gender... do they somehow lose it? And even if, the concept surely remains with them so they can identify and show aspects of either gender (according to which they was before ascending to elderhood) - so in the end their genderlesness would be just semantics.
---
Also, if what makes dragon and Elder Dragon different is the magic they contain, in a sence the same applies with humans and gods. And when the human contains enough magic and becomes god, they "keep" their gender quite clearly (see Kormir).
---
*insert Kasmeer derp face at the Breachmaker*
---
I fixed it deleting thread
---
&gt; I don't think any of the hardcore playerbases are really affected by the difficulty of the open world.
---
The problem wasn't difficulty for most hardcores  It was things like having to grind dragonstand for 80 hours to get a set of commanders armor to use in wvw. They spent 6 months after HOT release fixing all it's problems and not producing new content for a reason and it wasn't because it was "too hard" although they did tone it down a bit when they fixed everything else.
---
Two primary things for me.
---
Discussion and possible showcasing of expansion level content that they said would be coming (i.e. elite specs)
---
A timeline, preferably detailed. We know we get the prologue on the 17th, but is that just a short/small thing or is it like a full fledged chapter. When will episode 1 come out? Is it like a short prologue then 1 month later the chapter? Is it 4 months later? Etc.
---
I also would have been happy to hear what the other content teams are working on. (she said there are 4, so what are the other 3 non-story living world teams doing?)
---
Alright, point taken.
---
This may be to do with the kind of card you are using. For example, if your debit card is one designed for simply getting money from an ATM or paying for things in a shop it will not work on *any* online site. This is not what a straight debit card is designed to do.
---
Instead you can use a credit card (Visa, Mastercard) *or a* ***debit*** *Visa or Mastercard.* This is an important distinction because these are actually Visa and Mastercard's that are *designed to work as a debit card* (that is, they take the money directly from your bank account), but they are *styled the same as their credit card variants so are accepted online in the same way.*
---
In any case, you shouldn't be doing something you know is dodgy. No one wants to see you back here in 5 minutes posting about your banned account.....
---
&gt; and pvp gimmicks with pvp centric class design and balancing
---
Anet stopped giving a fuck about PvP balance ~5 years ago, find a new scapegoat please
---
What would have been enough is literally just briefly saying that elite specs will happen with season 5
---
I'll put it this way - if you have nothing to show, don't build up hype.
---
yup. I want more long term content, not just some maps that I prolly not gonna bother after a week
---
BuT thErES No sUbSCriptIOn FEe!
---
to me the one on the left looks like a necro's botched summon. While the right one looks like it wants to tear my face off.
---
It's real, Back when the game launched I was very active on the forms, about 2 years in I finally moved over to Reddit because of shit like that. While many people drink the cool-aid and 'love' Gail, she is one of the most power hungry community customer service reps I have ever seen (No, shes not a fucking MOD, she just had MOD powers and pretended to be a MOD).  Good riddance I say, and it's why i never visit the forums anymore.
---
As VP of Marketing, calling him a living commercial break is more of a compliment than anything.
---
If that's what you were going for then... good job!
---
Ok thx alot guys
---
*I'm the player character. I'm always annoyed*
---
The gw2 Reddit discord is a bit shit too.
---
GW2s PvP blows other MMOs out of the water, including big dogs like WoW and FFXIV. Whenever I login to GW2 it's almost always to play PvP, because the combat works so well for that content.
---
I don't fucking get the doubling down on single player instanced story crap. Is that really what most players are playing? It cannot have good retention rates, because it's a story, and not very repeatable.
---
Was fun to kill Them in bfa
---
Running a small business on your own, being a self starter, being well versed in new media production, having a built in audience who will at least check out any new projects. Yup, what a terrible CV.
---
&gt;make instability more fun in some way
---
theyve tried this over and over, and what point do we start telling them to give it up and stop wasting dev time on it?
---
we don't know what ascending from dragon to ED fully means so it's just speculation that the only difference is power and kralk's lore revelations were so vague that anything drawn from it is also just speculation.
---
the gender of EDs currently is just conjecture, we'll see next season (or saga) if anet has cocked up their genderless EDs or not but as of right now they haven't
---
&gt;You already lost me at the part where you think a society of love and tolerance is a bad thing 
---
You already lost me when you demonstrated your inability to read.
---
Oh how do I get the shirt?
---
It's true new players get both the expansions now but they still need to buy the LS, which people who have been here for a long time don't have to.
---
I agree the t-shirt is not the best though...
---
What I dreamed of was another game changing experience (to a certain extent), like mounts and gliding. Elite specs. Repeatable content.  
---
&amp;nbsp;  
---
If they had those on top of stories I'd be set for another 2 years.
---
Male version the shorts go down to the news, the female version goes up to the ass crack.  Of course.
---
Nice ty :) Just one thing. Maybe call it *ArcDPS for BlishHUD* instead of *Arcdps bhud* on the UI so it's in line with ArcDPS. 
---
Also, do you intend to make hovering tooltips with short descriptions ? Think that would be amazing. Could be the togo addon for everyone when installing stuff.
---
I agree with you, however, the comment you replied to was referring to the Q&amp;A method and not the overhyping of a "nothing" announcement. 
---
the Overhyping was a blunder that's for sure
---
I totally get what you're saying. The right one looks more sinister.
---
I dunno. I feel like I've found things that look intelligent to be less intimidating than things that look vacant. When there's intelligence and sinister intent behind the eyes, it's clearly something with motives. When it's just emptiness behind the eyes, it's something else entirely. It's not operating on malice, it just exists that way.
---
And to me, that's scarier than something with motives. It feels more like it belongs in the deep mysterious reaches of the world, and we're the ones invading its home, walking into its traps.
---
That is just their way of saying no...you get that right? GW2 is officially in Long term support where they ONLY try and drive new revenue, with minimal investments. The death of expansion packs (Which were NEVER supposed to be a thing in the first place) was the start of the long term support. That is the side effect of Buy 2 Play games that are MMO's. At this point, I would like ANet to have a sub option similar to what ESO has done. I think if they collected 10-13/m gave out a monthly allotment of Gems, unlocked all content (put LS content behind DLC paywalls) and such, I think the game would have a much better financial future then it currently does.  But, I have been saying this for the last 2-3 years and it hasn't happened yet and it probably never will. At this rate, its just a matter of time before GW2 drops off similar to how City of Heroes went (another NCSoft game that they killed off)

"It's the people's fault for hyping this up more than it should have been, Anet is a good company." - Rumored to be paid
---
Honestly this satirical post just brought out all of the brainlets. I personally found this post to be hilarious - Good job OP.
---
I wish they wouldn't for creatures that already have established models. Sure by all means give Drakkar an updated texture. but don't suddenly lose his wings/fins. That would suck.
---
Nice announcement btw. KEK
---
You can order from the German website. They even have the option to load the site in English on top where it says DE. (Small note: I think you still have to pay shipping fees and you can only pay with CC.)
---
Does anyone remember City of Heroes? I have a feeling that GW2 is going to go way of CoH eventually. Both being owned by the same parent company, both having similar management behavior near the end. Seems like it's only a matter of time.
---
I really want this as a ranger pet, it's actually kinda cute
---
I really love these cutscenes! Opens my eyes to the potential for the future and where this can go. I would love there to be a some sort of Guild Wars movie! :o
---
Vastly prefer the left one (deer skull), significantly creepier/unnerving
---
You’ve got the timeline backwards. Pvp and WvW were all part of the vanilla game. People are asking them to update/announce more than just PvE. The game is becoming a shell of what it once was. Jesus...how can you be so purposefully dense.
---
It’s like feeding rabbit meat to a starving child.
---
I've heard good things about Windscribe as a free VPN, but they have a data limit.  Fortunately, players reported switching to a VPN for part of the download, then switching back could unfreeze it.  Youtube has good VPN tutorials if you get stuck.
---
&gt; But as I stated earlier, as long as the character is interesting and does well.
---
Judging from the quality of gw2 writing thus far, are your hopes high or low for the character being done well?
---
She's talking about someone attacking devs? Is she completely out of touch or did something actually happen??
---
I looked away for a sec during that part of the stream I kind of thought the slide just got stuck or something.
---
&gt; customers wondering why its taking so long to deliver what you said you would.
---
Which is why you shouldn't promise them anything, ever.
---
For me, I’ve just got to the point where I don’t really like the gear treadmills much anymore so I play ESO on PS4 with some friends and the GF and GW2 on pc with a buddy of mine. I want to play wow and FFXIV still but I always felt like I couldn’t keep up with my guild-mates and always had something I had to go back and do. As a medic nowadays I simply don’t have a lot of time to funnel into “staying relevant” I like that with ESO and GW2 I can come and go whenever and it’s still relevant.
---
How is being nonbinary divisive? I'm intersex and identify as nonbinary, my existence is divisive to you? This is INCLUSIVE.
---
Well atleast she's doing a great role as anet dev, only replying the the comments that praise her, anet and the amazing event and ignoring the few that pointed out that say there was a vast majority of warranted critisisme. Can't say their inconsitent when it comes to that.

Yeah it does work, but I'm so confused about the sudden design changes, the other charr has a thin long snout too, the design is so sudden, tho If this means possible new faces, hair, horns then sign me up!
---
Eventually enough people are going to take you up on that, that the game actually will die. Do you not see that? That's literally how this works. It isn't entitlement, it is literally that if people are unhappy with a product then they will leave, and where will you and Anet be then? You NEED them to satisfy at least most of us, so the game can survive.
---
Ah yes, always quick to address the minority of dipshits insulting the devs !
---
But when it comes to the majority giving good criticism that is definitely warranted, we shall burry our heads in the sand and let the storm go by. "lalala we did a great job I can't hear you"
---
I utterly and absolutely agree with her!
---
There are ways for the playerbase to communicate that don't involve being a raging fuckshit. :)
---
WTF is this? YouTube? Why are we getting reactions to reactions?
---
and here kids we can see a textbox example of false equivalency
---
oh, and btw, fractals upscale you to 80. So a very poor example of whatever it is you think youre arguing.
---
anet seems more and more like a company full of special snowflakes, developing a beautiful game but often listens to positive feedback only 'cause they take most criticism personally.
---
Starter zones or /r/guildrecruitment
---
As an intersex and nonbinary person, I think this is pretty awesome. (And all that means is that I was born in-between and thus feel in-between, I don't get why that should make people angry.)
---
I’d like one of these devs to address the non-toxic constructive criticism instead of focusing on extreme cases for once.
---
Maybe things have been worse than what I’ve seen, but it seems like anet is taking a steaming dump on its devs with layoffs and such, and then when the players make legitimate complaints about the state of the game as a result the devs (and former devs) come out of the woodwork to attack the players for being “entitled” and “unrightfully complaining” about the state of the game that they play and support. Regardless of whether they are polite or not in their criticisms - with the dev’s response it’s always sort of a “how dare they express negative opinions at all, we work really hard”. But those opinions aren’t as much about devs as they are anet for cutting costs and strategy. 
---
It’s amazing that the devs have such devotion to anet that they abuse the players back whenever the players complain about anet or the game. Like somehow their devs are an army to take on the playerbase that anet has made a corporate decision to neglect.
---
I haven’t posted attacking any devs or any individual people, but I think I’ve decided to be done with GW2 based on anet’s policy decisions. The fact that I feel targeted by the devs for existing doesn’t help matters.
---
Maybe they felt attacked. I don't know nowdays what is harrased attacked etc. Our world end up shit. It's either praise or you are attacking us. Is that all we are allowed to do?cheer?
---
You still haven't learned to read.
---
&gt; It's: "WHY U NO TWEET THIS LIVESTREAM?! ANET LITERALLY HITLER??!?" 
---
No it's not and you know it's not.
---
Okay ruby you used the big words.
---
Where is the abuse? What do you consider abuse? Criticizing is not abuse. Even saying certain teams do a bad job is not a abuse, certainly not if warranted (like it not ANets communication and marketing is poor). Show us the abuse instead of just claiming there is because you (as a company not you personally) cannot take criticism when doing a bad job.
---
Is she serious?
---
Are they really so out of touch. We are attacking them?
---
Damn, there's nothing happening with this game and she thinks it's a good idea to say that??
---
 I can't understand this anymore. The fck are 250 or whatever number of people they have left working on? There's nothing, NOTHING and they expect people to just be chill and play the game no problem...
---
The vast majority of people giving criticism aren't attacking developers, but Anet's management of this game and their own developers.  Anet has amazing devs who do a fantastic job but the management at Anet is absolutely shit.  Multiple times I've heard from WvW and raid devs that they want, desperately, to actually do what people in the community want like repeatable CMs in raids or more difficult bosses but are handicapped by the decisions of the higher ups.
---
If people are actually attacking developers they are the minority of the minority and I barely see any of that.  So, instead of addressing valid criticisms from the community she, instead, focuses on the worst of it and applies to to the entire community.  That is pathetic.
---
People are generally concerned if there's going to be any new raids or fractals.  Why can't Anet just tell us?  Why can't we know more details about things like Strike Missions or the new masteries?  WHY THE FUCK must everything this company does be shrouded in 18 layers of secrecy.  It's mind boggling and ridiculous.
---
The key element is whether they go back to old content and make strike missions out of it.
---
If we are going to get something like 5 strike missions and then not anymore, it won't be as fun as if they go to previous event and make strike missions out of them, like the Hidden City and Sparkles 2.0, Retribution and the risen dragon in Claw Island, the Zhaitan fight we never actually got at the nest of the Dragon in Arah, Migraine, The Shadow of the Dragon, the flying mordrem teragriff, Joko, etc...
---
All great looking bosses or neat locations with lots of potential that never was fulfilled and that are fought by most people just once or twice, never to be seen again.
---
It's called deflection, turn the problem around so everyone else is at fault for being pissed at getting strung along into this over hyped Blog post. People are generally more aggressive when they feel betrayed and for many that debacle was a total and complete betrayal of trust, but yep she's right we're in the wrong.
---
Frankly I'd like to see an apology from Anet for treating their fan base like a bunch of complete idiots....shame on them for this mess!
---
We give constructive criticism, they ignore it.  We act like flaming asshats, they listen.  Why wouldn't we act like flaming asshates in the future if that's what it takes to get their attention?
---
If youre not having fun, then leave.
---
She didn't. Keep reading the responses in the thread. Such as:
---
[**Rubi**@Rubi\_](https://twitter.com/Rubi_)·[4h](https://twitter.com/Rubi_/status/1167862926536892417)Agreed. That's why I talked about abuse, not constructive criticism.
---
She's talking about the "you have to understand that the devs deserve abuse" stuff. As she said.
---
There is a pretty good mixture of emotions on this sub between players. Valid points have been made, name calling has happened...it’s been quite the ordeal, but the big questions remain unanswered. 
---
Instead of addressing ANYTHING pertinent, ruby just validated everyones complaints and vulgarity with a response. Not professional. 
---
We got more direct communication to the community through those 5 tweets than we do in 6 months.
---
Every community has toxic assholes that don't know how to control themselves. 
---
If you want to show them who's boss, ignore them and **address the legitimate criticism that's many many times more prevalent than the toxicity.**
---
It should show you the ping you get in game if you open the settings menu. If the ping is above 200, it'll start lagging. Arenanet has a whole page for networking issues  [https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201862998-Troubleshooting-Connectivity-Issues](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201862998-Troubleshooting-Connectivity-Issues)
---
This exactly. If people are complaining it means they're still invested to some degree, which is way better than complete silence. When that happens, when all the people invested enough to voice criticism have left, you know the game is dead.
---
I'm not saying that unintelligent creatures are scarier. Read my comment again.
---
Eyes give away what something is thinking. Intelligent eyes can convey malice, or anything. It makes motives fairly obvious.
---
But something unnatural, like having a bare skull for a face, could be equally intelligent but there would be no way of knowing what it's thinking because the intelligence doesn't show in its eyes.
---
It's not about the intelligence level. It's about how the eyes communicate intent at a glance. The one on the right has intelligent eyes. They communicate a desire to kill. The one on the left doesn't give us this information. We have no idea, and the not knowing is intimidating.
---
Like you said, the one on the left doesn't look alive. But something that's alive has vulnerability, and that will shape it's motivations. Something that's dead (read: might not be traditionally vulnerable) will have different motives, making it less predictable. It's an unknown, and much of Lovecraft is based around the unknown and the things too massive or horrible to comprehend. Giving something eyes that communicate malice makes it that much easier to comprehend, and that's less scary to me, because I can understand it.
---
Our opinions seem to diverge at this point.
---
You see an obvious sign of intelligence as scarier because *you don't know* what's behind that intelligence. That intelligence could want you to suffer in the most horrible way imaginable, but you know it's capable of that, and that's what you find scary.
---
I see the mask of indifference, unreadable, as scarier because it makes the creature seem more immovable, unshaken by anything I do. It is in control, because I can't know what it's thinking. *I don't know* what's behind that unflinching mask.
---
It's the same fear, just manifested in different ways.

---
What a way to show how Anet communication works. A lot of legit negative feedback about how they handled things and they decide to focus on the 0.00001% that talk abusively on the internet.
---
It is the internet, people take death threats over sneezing if you want to focus on that it clearly shows your agenda to hide and excuse yourself from the discussion at hand.
---
Very unprofessional, isn't she supposed to be comm manager now? Don't follow Gaile's footsteps, they don't lead anywhere pretty. Ugh.
---
Imagine if a football player gave an interview after losing a match, and just going on about how he got a few online messages with abusive intent (they get death threats like after every game as tweets let's be honest lol) and didn't talk about his performance what he thought of the match etc. just that and stopped the interview. People would laugh at that at best, and call them out on their bullshit heavily.
---
Nobody is this fragile, stop the bullshit.
---
He's better at it than any of the Anet people were...
---
I agree with her that the devs should not be abused on social media and stuff, but anet never and I mean never ever listens to what the community has to say about the game(even constructive criticism from anet partners). They live in their own bubble and cant hear anything from the outside. Its clear that the devs dont even play their own game( You can see them streaming and skill clicking and stuff). They only hear us when there is an outrage (like mount lootboxes). They just pretty much announced that the game is going on maintenance mode and they try to cash grab as much money they can until the game is completely dead.  In my opinion we should spam every guild wars 2 forum/reddit/discord or whatever with our dissatisfaction of the announcement(not being toxic just express our opinion) and then quit the game until they fix it. I personally left the game after wing 5 because of the content drought that still continues to this day, and it seems that will still be the case in the near future. I suggest to the community to do the same and go play other MMOS that are more worth our time and money.
---
The irony that you come off like way more of a jackass.
---
Shes not a dev.
---
Only if we get a video from Asmongold reacting to Rubi's reaction.
---
Just that they aren't addressing anything.
---
&gt; I've been working in this industry for 10 years and playing in it since I was a little girl. 
---
Yet, still no back bone.  Typical DEV response in 2019. They all feel under attack and becomes quickly unprofessional about it. If the DEV's were doing their jobs correctly then they would not be as nearly as under attack. Personally, I work with hundreds of DEVs and they all exhibit the same 'quick to push code' mentality and do not give 2 shits what that says about them at the end of the day. I for one to not believe that DEVs deserve any lenience when it comes down to it.  The noisy ones are generally the ones that do the quick and shoddy releases and have to defend themselves the most about it. That is how this twitter post reads to me, She is such a DEV.
---
Or you can just YouTube it yourself. The game does have flaws pvp being bad is one of them but the combat system is not one of them for most people who play MMOs cause it actually does it very well. Just admit the combat isn't like gw2 so you don't like it instead of calling it slow because your never got past level 10
---
Hey Rubi Bayer, I understand how hard it must be lately, and I commend you for your bravery being front and center as the face of GW2. 
---
Most people do not talk about uncomfortable topics like this in the game industry, and I think it is important that you did bring it up.
---
Personally, any time I have ever criticized the game, it was NEVER directed towards the devs themselves. I acknowledge how hard you people work to create content for us. Though some of us might sometimes meme the game, most of us draw the line on reddit/twitch. We NEVER, EVER intend to make anything personal! 
---
I fully condemn anyone who goes to a developer's personal twitter account to harass them. And I am so sorry you had to deal with it.
---
Please take my e-hugs, and take a breather if you can. Remember you have thousands of fans who only wish you the best.
---
I see them as a new type of activity like bounties, adventures, and mount races were.  
---
I certainly hope they don't end up replacing fractals or raids.
---
A lot of people here will start doing that if ANet keeps going down this path.
---
&gt;But when it comes to the majority giving good criticism that is definitely warranted
---
Yeah, in those cases your average ANet dev calls you a rando asshat.
---
I don’t mind the vertical progression, but GW2 is a horizontal, and imo, it’s not “progressing”
---
Huh? The upcoming Living World Season will be exactly the same, with or without that presentation. The ongoing disappointment was or is not about the Living World.
---
A single pea was originally a pease, but since the singular version sounded like a plural word, people began referring to a single pease as a pea.
---
No, it would still be a painful stagnation for the game.
---
This will be another system that ANET is going to abandon after .. lets say 3 episodes. Take a look at bounties .. still somewhat of a clusterfuck .. but hey who cares .. right? Love4ANET
---
Let's ask the people. Everyone! If you decided to quit the game after this announcement comment below with “me“. I include logging in once for a new episode as quitting because this is not how you play a fucking mmo. That's how you play Life is Strange.
---
Dunno about you, but when severals threads that are essentially just abusive get upvoted to the frontpage, I wouldn't call that just a minority. If you want them to ignore that vocal minority, then ensure that they're downvoted to hell and don't have a voice, so that the actual polite and constructive criticism can be unobstructed.
---
Me.
---
&gt; great role as anet dev, only replying the the comments that praise her 
---
But...that is exactly why she even took time to post to twitter. To feel better about herself.
---
&gt;I genuinely think that the community's opinion regarding this new LW Saga would have been celebrated if it was simply a blog post, rather than an extremely hyped-up announcement event.
---
That's exactly what some, if not most of us, think. 
---
Why bother making setting up a countdown? Why bother making multiple posts about it? Why bother renting out *a fucking theater* for it?
---
Smh.
---
No way to be 100% sure, some say it was 5, others said it was 10, but there isn't really proof on how many were actually given out during the streams. I know some Anet partners were given codes to hand out how they see fit as well.
---
Go to the forums. There are hundreds, even thousands of well written, properly constructed, eloquent questions, comments, polls, discussions and criticisms, even BUGS. All unanswered, going back years. Even the threads that get 100’s of comments and spark proper discussion just fade away, never to be acknowledged by anet. 
---
So, I guess you’re just not really doing your research.
---
Well said. ANet need to understand that if they consistently and constantly ignore the community's constructive criticism and only starts responding when the community starts acting like flaming asshats, then the community starts acting only like flaming asshats because ANet has straight up admitted that they only ever listen to flaming asshats. From everyone else's perspective, ANet straight-up consider flaming asshats more important than constructive criticism.
---
Yea, no. You are delusional if you think that was "most of the stuff". 
---
You should apply for community management at Anet if they get the spot empty again. Enough qualifications right there.
---
This is why I've mostly turned to indie game devs and smaller dev companies who are very transparent about what they're doing, take direct feedback with the playerbase and communicate with them and clearly show that the passion and ideas the studio wants to go with is what's prioritized, not milking people's money.
---
If you think this is a delusional dream, then you clearly haven't tried to find these kind of games and devs. That said, if you want an MMO in that area you're in tough luck, as those games are simply just giant behemoths that need someform of income and easily get way over their head of minimizing effort for profit.  
---
Either way, there was a time Anet and Blizzard was in that stage of smaller devs where their passion and ideas leaked out into their games over profit, sadly time and success corrupt even the best of devs and you gotta realize that you shouldn't put the brand on a pedestal, but the people who at that time make them that way. Sooner or later those gets replaced, whether quit, change job or retire, and then the ones who get promoted ends up being the wrong people.  
---
So the lesson to learn is that smaller and newer devs with great projects who are transparent are kinda fine, as long as you don't grow too attached. The thing to watch out for is being stuck in nostalgia and to realize that it's not the brand that makes the games you loved, it's the people. Once those get replaced and the company grows in its success, the way it works gets shifted and it loses its old identity.
---
Reminds me of the Leshen from The Witcher.
---
What? This is happening because you downvoted us for years, YEARS! 
---
You know, oppression, kinda works for a while than it all bursts out in 1 go.
---
Also upvoted threads aren't toxic at all...
---
It's easy to miss the abuse when it isn't directed at you. I can guarantee you that arenanet devs were on the receiving end of quite a storm of hate among other things.
---
Um..yes? You speak as if we all approve of leveling and level-based game design.
---
As usual, them focusing on the bad and completely ignoring the real feedback.
---
I think something will need beta testing emm the swiss tournament testing, WvW restructuring will need beta testing. I still think elite specs are likely further in the future when we get into the what I'm calling the post layoff work i.e. episode 1 and 2 would have been or started development between September 19th for episode 1 and January 9th for episode 2. Episode 3 would have begun development rather recently actually in May most likely and the 4th content team could have been the prologue or are working on episode 4 of the saga.
---
&gt;ideology
---
I'm eager to be convinced otherwise at least as it pertains to biological reasons outside of classified deformities.
---
It would've been better if they just dropped the trailer with none of the other hoopla, and said the next season is starting in two weeks.
---
Then when it does start, the disappointment of no new elite specs, raids or fractals could at least be galvanized by having some new content.
---
Virtual Reality for GW ? You are 100% dreaming. Plus , VR sucks , and most people don't like and don't want it.
---
No, budgets are an issue. Vision and direction are the 2nd tier issues. To hire true visionaries with direction you need budgets. GW2 is an unpolished turd right now, they need someone(s) to come in and polish it back out.
---
Well thats honestly nothing new about Anet.
---
the opposite can have worse consequences. 
---
"but Anet promised us xxx! what a bunch of lying cunts!" 
---
"Anet doesn't follow through what they say, they can't be trusted"
---
in development like many other companies gaming or not. projects and ideas get started and canned all the time. 
---
PR is there to make sure they get the least amount of "mad people" as possible. and in this case not saying anything is the way to get the least amount of people pissed at Anet
---
I suspect people were stalking her personal social media and flooding her with comments about game criticism. 
---
It's the underbelly of the video game industry not many developers are willing to bring up. This industry is savage. 
---
There's a reason why many developers go quiet on social media.
---
They literally just updated several fractals a couple weeks ago. There are bigger more genuine issues in this game. The community needs to not over exaggerate non-issues and start demanding from the devs an actual long term roadmap for the different game modes.
---
&gt; Never anything in between (not since that lame initiative years ago)
---
What lame initiative?
---
Yours and the teams cut scenes keep getting better, thank you for your work. Super excited for the full thing and other scenes to come
---
&gt; No wonder I have you on -5.
---
What does that mean?
---
That is totally fine. If you are done with the game then i respect that. We will all end up there at some point because that is the life cycle of any game. I shortly scrolled through your history of posts and i belive your posts are not those i describe. You seem to be able to see things from all sides and that makes your posts valuble. 
---
The get the fluff out and shut the fluff up because ded game and arena net hates you so uninstall the game and hate on the company for years to come-posts are those that i feel are just mindblowing entitled kids who seem to have or lack of parents or other adults not doing their job properly because they did not give their kids enough knowledge on when to let go and when it becomes creepy because you don't let go.
---
&gt; I’d like one of these devs to address the non-toxic constructive criticism instead of focusing on extreme cases for once.  
---
They won't. And given how active Anet employees are on Reddit, my $5 says they're aware of the more level-headed criticisms we've been laying out here. And I'm personally hard-pressed to find any examples of such abuse she refers to. In the time I've spent hanging out here and on Twitter, I have yet to see any weird comparisons between Anet and Hitler. I'm sure there's a vocal minority out there that's taking it far, bit guess what? That's all they are!  
---
I think Anet's management is keeping their developers on a short leash and not allowing them to be upfront and honest about how bad things *really* are on the GW2 development front. It doesn't help that games like FF14 and WoW (Classic mainly?) are chugging along and still pushing out regular content. If there was ever a time to really come clean and be honest, now is it. But they're just burning bridges.
---
I don't think she would post this unless attacks are actually happening, I get it a lot of people are unhappy but fuck man. Attacking devs will literally not do anything, In fact it's making things worse.
---
Lol, will do in next update, I wasn't sure of how to call it but your description is short and to the point, gets the job done perfectly :)
---
And yes I can stick some tooltips on more things as well.
---
Oh look, the Anet white knight has crawled out from Anet's asshole to defend them once again
---
0.
---
😍
---
No , and I'm tired of the endless posts suggesting it. It's stupid.
---
One of the things that drove me absolutely crazy with Warframe and Digital Extremes is that they (at the time) *never* responded to anything with rational or constructive criticism, but they would spend ridiculous amounts of time talking about rageposts on social media, official streams, and even on their own forums.
---
It sends the message that if you want the devs to see what you're saying you have to get toxic. At least when it comes to criticism.
---
Frankly, I've gotten the impression that ANet is more of a clubhouse than a business. It feels like they take great pains to insulate themselves from the community and have an even worse case of the "you think you want it, but you don't" blizzard mentality.
---
Whenever I see interaction between devs and community, it's either condescending on the part of the devs, or very carefully managed (I.E. picking the nicest questions). Besides the management issues ANet seems to face, the relationship with the community almost feels adversarial.
---
Honestly, I'm curious what it looks like inside ANet right now. I'm friends with devs from other games. They're human too. And the perception players have of what's actually going on behind the scenes is usually pretty wrong.
---
I mean, even if they do decide to remove it, all OP would have to do is ask for opinions on how he should finish it and then that clearly makes it no longer violate the rule. I think being that pedantic would be a bit of a waste of time. 
---
&gt; then what the fuck is.
---
Just flicked through the sub, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxjyze/todays_reveal/) for example seems far lower effort. It would have taken a fraction of the time to make, and adds nothing that isn't already in the far more popular posts on the topic. In fact, it seems exactly like something that should have been a reply in one of those other threads.
---
\^This.
---
One of the best thing they could do with strike missions is to also go through old bosses and rework them to 10 people encounters as strikes. wouldn´t peobably be that much workt, just tweak some numbers and adjust the excisting mechanics to 10 people, maybe add some small new things to spice things up. (but then again.. a-net is known for weid spagethi code so i have no clue if it would really be that easy. knowing them adjusting some numbers on a boss will suddenly turn the physics in the related story mission upside down)
---
because some of them were awesome but sadly they were a thing of done and forget since there was no reason to repeat them beside one or two achivements.
---
I highly doubt it... but an idealistic optimist in me hopes that they will do it. This optimist also still hopes that they just fucked up the presentation and that over the LS5 (or how they call it now Icebrood saga) they will give us x-pack like content and just pulled of the usual A-net communication...
---
&gt;Gender is a construct, people who choose to conform to the societally held standard of masculine/feminine genders are no more valid or "scientifically supported" or whatever than people who choose to express their understanding of themselves in a different way, NB or otherwise. Denying anyone's gender is basically just an exercise in rudeness and malice.
---
I see this touted often enough. It comes off as redefining for the sake of creating an argument; you can ask most people on this planet and I assure you that they use sex and gender interchangeably - this is a modern phenomena like the redefining of racism and the term "reverse racism". Yikes nothing.
---
&gt; You can make the (extremely insensitive and callous) argument that expressing what they consider their authentic gender hamstrings them socially, that the lens they're choosing to represent themselves through is bad because it'll be met with misunderstanding, hostility, and standoffishness or whatever, but to say that it's invalid is insanely smoothbrained. You cannot make a good argument that anyone's personal form of expression is any more valid than the next. 
---
You're free to be insensitive all you want towards my position, insensitivity shouldn't hamstring discussion. As dated and dull as the attack helicopter meme is, it still uses your position against you rather well in that such a meme identity could still be percieved as "valid" as anything else in the non-binary category. The other is always hamstrung against the majority in some form or fashion and that can't be changed without some serious social engineering which I think is impossible.
---
&gt; This isn't an ideological position. It isn't up for debate, unless you want to debate that gender as a concept should be abolished entirely. Most people in """your crowd""" aren't willing to concede that, though. It's a statement of reality--namely that there are people, who really exist, who diverge from the status quo when it comes to ideas about gender. Denying that is denying the truth. 
---
Yes it is, and yes it is.
---
Thats what you call abusive? The majority are voicing their disappointment or cracking jokes about the situation.
---
It's sad to see that ANet is more interested in killing off what little goodwill they have left than actually trying to communicate for once.
---
&gt; no idea what crowd you mean 
---
the
---
&gt; i don't understand how being non-binary is dispute or smth 
---
Crowd.
---
I haven't seen many direct attacks on devs and vastly more attacks on ANet the company, it's management, and NCSoft. It goes without saying that harassment should be punished.
---
The reason this anger has fomented is because management never prioritized polishing their content. A million and one upvoted and constructive posts have been made about the state of WvW and nothing has been done about it.
---
The point being that the notion that it's just a few threads isn't accurate. It's ignoring the context of all this. The reason there is public outcry is precisely because of how well articulated, endlessly discussed player concerns have been wordlessly ignored for *years*. So, if ANet won't react to constructive criticism then or now, when will that reaction come? When will it take action to resolve problems it acknowledges exist?
---
If you decontextualize this from the years of bad blood that have led up to this moment, then yeah, it does seem like an overreaction. Set in context, and suddenly it makes sense why people are furious. It wasn't about an underwhelming announcement. The announcement just happened to be the straw that broke the camel's back.
---
As a PvE player, I wish there were a better WvW map for solo and smallscale play.
---
I'm not into the whole zergging by following a commander tag.
---
I'd rather disrupt camps and dolyaks, but that's not very lucrative for smaller groups.
---
I just want... another game mode. Something that still contributes to the mist war, but with a different goal than large-scale conquest.

---
Why would we make constructive criticism posts when they appear to not be acknowledged but when we create a wall of flame you either eventually bend the knee when it becomes too much or atleast tell us you will ignore us. Whenever reddit goes up in flames many times the top comments on the negative posts are actual constructive criticism yet that doesn't seem to be acknowledged and now you just end up with these scenarios. Don't blame us when you appear to only communicate earnestly when everything is up in flames.
---
So, basically you consider everything sort of sucking anet dry abuse I take it?
---
Did some people say content draught before layoffs? Sure, some said it during season 1 when we were getting releases every 2 weeks but you know that's not what I am talking about. Ironically after the end of S4 when anet started dropping small community based content rather then praising them for giving us little things to do in between episodes people pointed at that and at the layoffs and started shouting from the rooftops that we were in for another HoT style draught. 
---
400 employees is a lot, no Mmo has a team that size. Even WoW with its endless bag of money has close to 300 employees working on it and that includes the team managing classic. When gw2 launched it had a team of 300 it is usual for teams to shrink post release luckily anet didn't fire them like other companies generally do, but I guess probably moved them to work on the other projects + hired new stuff to gradually boost those teams. Now it's undeniable that recently gw2 devs were moved over to help with those projects, id speculate it's why we have no new expansion but hey is it wrong for a company to try to safe guard it's future? Clearly drastic actions were needed to save those projects and clearly failing to do that would have had drastic negative consiquences. Should they have rolled over and died without a fight? It's not like had they let those projects die with trying to save them would have resulted in a bigger budget from ncsoft so we'd still have lost talent on gw2. But personally I'd rather loose out on an expansion if it meant saving 150 jobs not just because it's the right thing but also because they are amazing talent that do things no other Mmo does.
---
The expansion type comment is simply an excuse to legitimate baseless attacks. Never mind I don't believe they even mentioned that this time around but let's say they did, where is it written that an expansion has to have raids ? And let's not forget here we're talking about expansion like features not includes every single feature an expansion does, so even if somehow  an expansion has to have raids, the expectation of raids being part of ls discussion is unreasonable and that's without factoring in we all know gw2 keeps raids and living story separate.
---
Now non of this is to say anet are perfect and do no wrong. Arguing 9 month cadence for raids is too slow is perfectly legitimate and most certainly would join that sentiment. Would I love better communication? Most certainly but here is the thing this community has a tendency of getting everything anet says and hit them in the head with it. You did it yourself with the whole expansion like statement. Here is some food for thought, sharing your plans in advance reduces your control and room for manuverability. Why would any company give that up if all they get in return is bad publicity from their fans no less that will ultimately drive away their customers? Do you remember Martin kerstien ? (Probably got his name wrong) he used to be community team lead that quite when on one of the first controversies MO didn't follow his advice to just say nothing. He said something along the lines of I have 10 years of experience that tell me open communication is unwise here. I am ashamed to say part of me was happy he moved on as I truly believed better communication was healthy for the game. Well naturally 10 experience wins because it turns out Martin was completely right.
---
I got my 60bux worth of value from the game I’d say it’s worth it
---
It’s not an MMO with much longevity though. Quit after like 3 months ish? Very fun to play through though
---
I know all too well that projects can get delayed or canned.
---
I also know all too well that honesty and clear communication buys you a lot of credit if its needed and something doesn't work out so long as that's not a constant. PR is there to make the least amount of angry people, well they fail at that. Being honest, open and fair with your community is most likely the better way. But they are not open, cherry picking is not honest.
---
Yep, same here. I definitely have more hours in PvE than in PvP/WvW combined. But you can definitely bet on me playing those other modes more if Anet wasn't so dismissive of them in the first place.
---
Man, and I had so many high hopes for GW2, too. It and FF14 are the only MMOs I've ever made it to endgame in. It's really sad to see it slowly die like this, but NCSoft gonna NCSoft. I liked City of Heroes a lot too before it died, though I never made it to endgame there (still loved it though). Been thinking about playing that again after its 'revival'.
---
WTF please stop these attempts to divert from the issues that we raise with the "toxic gamers" bullshit.
---
* Where is this mass harassing and threatening of developers happening? Because I didn't see it here. Link please.
---
* We are disappointed with the COMPANY ArenaNet not with the developers. I know you think you are all a big family there but guess what, you are not. I will re-evaluate this when you are a collective that shares all profit between you and does every decision in the company together.
---
* ArenaNet is a subsidiary of a publicly traded billion dollar company. It's a highly efficient machine with the sole purpose to generate as much profit as possibe for its shareholders. Companies have no feelings that we can hurt.
---
* I have zero empathy for a company that showers us in microtransactions and lootboxes and uses every trick in the "Make Players Payers"-handbook to convince players that spending 200-300 bucks every month on gems is normal.
---
Now is this not just a kick in the teeth to all the people actually giving feedback, and not in a toxic manner. This is a great way to generalise and entire community based on a few individuals actions.
---
Not sure what you're getting at here...?  Most people are surprised because the voice-over sounded somewhat masculine or androgynous.  It's not mocking or contemptuous... it's intriguing to people that the VA, whoever she is, could create that kind of interesting affect to her voice; leading people to speculate about the interesting implications about Jormag's gender (i.e. the Svanir/Flame Legion being misogynistic and what not).
---
It's not an exploit. In fact I've been shoveling in as many people as I can to drive the price down on the ascended mats. Soon they'll be around 10s each and I can just buy them from the TP rather than farm seeds every day. 
---
I do farm them on 8 accounts every day so far, but I'm not selling any, just using them for WvW feasts.
---
Gotta share the wealth!
---
Not to mention she chose literally the single worst way to deal with it by going to Twitter. Nothing good *ever* comes from taking your issues to social media.
---
Sad to see the community is so toxic.
---
ArenaNet works hard for us. They're a small indie studio. Nothing like Blizzard or Square Enix.
---
Blizz and SE make their games because they want money. ArenaNet makes games because they love gaming and are true gamers themselves.
---
That's the different.
---
Going to buy more gems from the store tonight. I won't betray them.
---
It's a common glitch! Here's how you fix it.
---
Step 1: Click on the item you want to sell
---
Step 2: click on the button that says 'list item'
---
step 3: this is an important one. Set the price of the item. Don't undercut by one copper like an asshole
---
Problem solved! This glitch is a tricky one. But it's a great solution because it also enables you to not be swindled by bulk quickbuy goblins who steal your shekels.
---
Three points here:
---
1. She's right about the harsh abuse - it is completely unwarranted and disgusting
---
2. There is valid criticism here, and none of it is being addressed
---
3. If they would at least communicate with us what they're planning for the future of the game, a lot of future disasters like this situation could be averted
---
Well said. To negate the consequence of delivering poor work because of this is just unprofessional. In the midst of the chaos,  there are a lot of good criticism.
---
As a new player, of course, that has never been the problem.
---
&gt;cherry picking is not honest.
---
it is as long as they state which questions were asked (unlike the presentation)
---
the questions they chose not to answer may not have been ready for an answer.
---
you know what happens when you don't cherry-pick answers? 
---
"don't you guys have phones?" - remember that? that's what you get with no PR. They learned that lesson. 
---
However, they did the same mistake that Blizzard made (the same day actually)
---
the biggest announcement, main stage, hyped to no end!.... diablo immortal... a mobile game... 
---
Anet's big announcement, Rented theatre, twitch live countdown, months worth of announcement about the announcement... next living story.... (nothing really)
---
This whole announcement could have been done with a couple of tweets maybe a dev blog and no one would be pissed.
---
A simple statement about their current plans (and yes they're not final and change, this is fine) beyond season 5.
---
Specifically, could we see an expansion after season 5 or are dedicated expansions off the table entirely?
---
As a tie-in to the previous question: what constitutes "expansion level features" we can expect if they stick to a Living World format of content delivery? The features they announced for the Icebrood Saga are your bog standard Living World features we've come to expect since Season 3.
---
Nothing definitive, no hard dates and certainly nothing ready to be showcased, just a simple statement where development plans of the game are headed for the foreseeable future.
---
That would've been enough for me even if I didn't like the direction, it's better than letting us sit in a void where speculation runs rampant.
---
It is cult like behaviour
---
How is budget an issue if they keep making stuff free? They could milk us dry with an xpack every year, but they don't.
---
The gemstore is somehow enough for ANet.
---
I will say it at least once because, I'll have to admit, I've only been complaining since yesterday; I'm still excited to see how the next chapter of living world turns out to be, and I acknowledge the efforts Anet have put in despite this roller coaster of a year. But, I will also say how I feel one last time: I feel betrayed, once again. Because I am seemingly out of touch with the current situation, as Arenanet doesn't communicate, they refuse to admit any form of weakness beforehand, so they decide to reveal their disease-weakened body to us without warning, and that's what has led to violent reactions. From now on, the best way to prevent this would be to clearly state the things that are under development. No more surprises, no more letdowns. What I got from this announcement was that they didn't seem to know where they were going; well you need to figure it out!
---
You could roam, and then mounts arrived.
---
I actually think porting to console is a great idea to invite new players. Like a "new" launch to the game.
---
Pathetic really, as noted elsewhere this is pretty much a form of gaslighting.
---
And it will end up being an outfit
---
This just shows they refuse to understand why the event got the reaction it did.
---
I used to use Launchbuddy but when Anet changed how logins are stored, I never was able to get it to work. Now I use Gw2Launcher. It took some trial and error to set up since I found the documentation a bit lacking, but now I'm happy with it and it has a smaller (visual) profile than Launchbuddy has.
---
Anet knows how to butcher concept art unfortunately.
---
I mean, they also thing the presentation was a success soooo we're screwed...
---
Very cool of you!
---
If you want try something less common and interesting, may want to give renegade a try with harrier stats, if you have legendary gear you can also switch to diviner or add some offensive stats to help with team damage.
---
As far as everything goes I'd say that I'm a disenfranchised moderate; I'm playing maybe 1-2 times per week.  
---
I'm not "mad" about the state of GW2 anymore, Rubi, I'm exhausted and resigned.  I see what people like [Bex@GGG](https://old.reddit.com/user/Bex_GGG/submitted/?sort=top) or her replacement, [Natalia@GGG](https://old.reddit.com/user/Natalia_GGG/submitted/) do to provide a steady stream of foreshadowing, excitement and inspiration for future content.   
---
These last 2-3 months I've started to feel like any form of excitement or teaser has to be vetted by NCSoft or Mike'OBrien.  It's an unrealistic and archaic strategy that isn't earning you any good-will with the community.  There's a reason why I'm turning to other sources of entertainment like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Kindle (Books) and other games like FF XIV or Path of Exile.  They do a better job of putting out trailers, teasers and "excerpts" that keep people excited and interested to learn more about characters, world-building, features &amp; content.  
---
My largest problem isn't with the developers, Rubi.  It's with ArenaNet management, NCSoft and marketing.  You have a lot of competitors that are breaking into the genre with earnest products like Path of Exile or Warframe and engage in sufficient communication to maintain a healthy level of engagement with the game.  The AMA's were "stress-relief" valves and the decision was made to seal them shut.  The ArenaNet team didn't always answer hard questions, but *something* was far better than **nothing.**
---
I understand that reality has changed since the layoffs and the PR dynamics of the JP incident.  The truth is that a lot of people are scared, frustrated and worried by the uncertainty that their play-styles represent in light of the 8/30 presentation.  It's one thing to say that WvW Restructuring, "Alliances" are on the table, and another thing to back that up with tangible evidence.  The community can either be your greatest ally or your greatest enemy, but when you don't level with us or allow expectations and imagination to run wild?  
---
The #1 problem is that we really can't "judge you for what you say" because the company has to be provoked out of silence.  I think it's well-known that devs that participate on Reddit do so voluntarily and in an unofficial capacity.  You all were doing really good for a long time with the various feature-rich Guild Chats, the "Behind the voice," series and then everything got ... busy?  I don't necessarily need these huge expansion announcements.  **What I need from ArenaNet is a commitment to a consistent, forthright communication policy.**
---
As someone who's been trading stocks for some time now, this is something I try to instill in people around me. Companies aren't your friends. They're just there to provide a product or enrich shareholders. That's it. Stop attaching human attributes to them, people. If they fail to deliver, that is that. There's no need to come out in their defense.
---
Are you feeling okay? Or replying to wrong person ?
---
Well Fractals are not living story content or cosmetics, so yes assume they are dead or will be dead.
---
Yeah I'm good without following/subscribing someone I don't care for.  
---
Good luck everyone who bothers.
---
Ever since the whole Price incident I've also felt that with this game in particular the devs see themselves as being completely separate from the community. I actually wonder if any of them even activily play their own game or just games in general. I don't know it just all kinda feels off to me.
---
No, you have to use costume brawl skills only, and they do no damage
---
Another day, another random complaint nobody cares of.. keep it up.
---
only problem is that she's been at it since at least last sunday, which is rather convenient, as feedback and reactions regarding ANets own announcement can just be swept under the same umbrella.
---
&gt;400 employees is a lot, no Mmo has a team that size.
---
I agree. The problem is their ability to produce content, features and systems for GW2 with however many people they have had on it, has been woeful.
---
&gt; The expansion type comment is simply an excuse to legitimate baseless attacks.
---
Not really, it is simply one of things that created increased expectations.
---
&gt; where is it written that an expansion has to have raids ?
---
It isn't, but then I didn't specifically mention raids and no the lack of a raid by itself wouldn't be a source of criticism in this regard. The fact that in addition to no raids, PvP/WvW basically got nothing, that the living meme that is the 7 year wait for build templates is still not even there yet, no new elites, etc, basically a complete lack of stuff that is "expansion type content".
---
Which is then made worse for PvP/WvW because they have already been waiting a laughable length of time for things like Aliiances, Swiss, even the removal of monthly AT, etc.
---
The time it takes Anet to put out content, new features, new systems is absolutely laughable, which is why their game has fallen behind the likes of ESO which pumps out 3 DLCs, and a mini-expansion a year and partly why their revenue is at the laughable levels it is (20-25%) higher than Aion...
---
It is just another example of Anet marketing ineptitude.
---
we can accept this fate or defy it, but we cannot deny it
---
 "*Shante*, *you stay*"
---
That's gold. I will save it.
---
'Liked' is an understatement.
---
That was friggin awesome.
---
Interesting difference. The left one has that vibe you expect from most ghost-ish creatures...but the one on the right? THAT is something I'd be terrified of running into, it looks far more dangerous and threatening.
---
Content Marketing Manager, you dumbwit
---
Yet another drone that did zero research trying to pin the blame on the players and not on ANet.
---
Ok, hold the fuck up, do you people have family working at ArenaNet or something? So many defend them through their bullshit as if you had a personal stake in the company. Only people that need a necessary reality check is people like yourself.
---
&gt;i gotta say that i find i quite convenient for her to start ranting about toxicity directed at people in the gaming industry shortly before the company
---
What are you on about? She made these comments AFTER the event, in RESPONSE to the reactions.
---
Why does WvW have to be only conquest and only towers you can only enter by breaking the gate/wall?
---
When the game initially launched, there were competitive events in WvW where players compete to win factor over a tribe of NPCs by doing the event objective while sabotaging the opposing team. 
---
I'm not saying whether it was good or not, but it is an example and proof of concept for: Competitive Events.
---
What would an open world map be like if three teams were competing for dominance around the area? It's a neat thought experiment, and something that might bridge the gap between PvE and WvW.
---
Of course, they could also do other game modes than competitive events. Maybe we could have a map based around King of the Hill?  Or maybe they could bring back Fortune's Vale?  What if they revisit the Obsidian Sanctum concept where a server contests the end of a long dungeon, and have to fend off players progressing through it using siege and traps? (I'm actually nostalgic for 2013 when Obsidian Sanctum was that kind of map...)
---
The point is that they can do a LOT with WvW. When you have three servers going at each other, you can do all sorts of objectives! MUCH more than tower conquest!
---
The people who like tower conquest already have borderlands and EBG. I want something NEW!
---
&gt; Undercutting by 1 copper is done to preserve the overall value of the item, not to be a jerk. ""Undercutting."" """"""Preserves the price."""""""
---
T. One-Copper Undercutter. You know matching the price has the same affect all without slowly driving down the price of an item, don't you? Nah, you didn't think of then when you were neurotically undercutting to place yourself in the front of the line like a selfish idiot.
---
Yes. Nearly everything gives you XP and the progression is linear not quadratic. Kills mobs, doing Hearts, Events (orange stuff), discovering new places, seeing Vistas, gatherings, resing players/npcs, and crafting give XP.
---
Though the idea is it's kinda lost due the expansion GW2 was designed to "play right now, how you want, when you want" not "grind till cap then the game starts". Take your time and enjoy Tyria, there are lots of nooks and crannies out to explore.
---
I'm with you on the right one. It feels...more terrifying, more threatening. more dangerous. Left is...I dunno, generic deer skulled creature we've fought in multiple other games?
---
I don't really see it as a problem. AFAIK, she doesn't make content for the game, and the game content she does speak about comes on a script. I dont think she has as much to say about direct game content as we think she does.
---
All the people in denial about classic WoW saying it's nostalgia when it's just good game design.
---
Legit the most excited I have been for a GW villain in a long time.
---
You can't talk this way to customers. When you disappoint people who pay your salary you better expect a reaction. This is the most common problem in business and they can't even handle it.
---
I've spent thousands on the game after 7 years. Apparently my money was spent on side projects while they killed the content I liked. What reaction did they expect?
---
I've seen people just as mad over messed up dinners at restaurants I've worked in. And when I disappoint a customer at work you better believe I'm contrite. BECAUSE THEY PAID US MONEY.
---
Me from headstart with none of these skins: oh man i hope one of these skins is worth it. got a lawless glove skin :D
---
Yes if you already owned HoT you will get 2 letters. 1 will have the "Heart of Thorns Emblem Clothing Outfit". The other letter will have a "Mordrem Glider" and "Heart of Thorns Veteran's Armor Voucher". Mine took about 24 hours to show up.
---
It's funny to see people at a floundering company pretend to play the victim. You set expectations, you didn't  provide anything of substance and now you're being called on it. For adults your company sure is comprised of a lot of cry babies with no semblance of thick skin. 
---
Your streams are below industry standards, your release schedule is below standards, your communication is below standards, how on gods green earth could you honestly think anything good would come of that, your company should be embarrassed over what you did with that theater not defensive of it. 
---
Do better.
---
Combat and massive multiplayer experiences make the game enjoyable. On the other hand story content is not why I play MMOs.
---
its not a giveaway, if you ask for subscriptions or retweets in return
---
Im dissapointed with this reaction. They defend theirselves from the extreme haters but still nothing about what is going on.
---
Stop acting like victims and tell us where is the problem. We love this game and we want to help.
---
The fact that they did it says they thought it was a good idea.
---
I mean... We had 9 month cadence release for raids from W4? maybe, W5 for sure. So we'll se in may.
---
RemindMe! 7 months
---
He said he is going to play GW2 how it was intended, 3 hours every 4 months.
---
Go to the Matthew Medina thread plenty of examples there. 
---
Ruby also mentioned people are rampantly engaging in hyperbole and guess what you can look at your own post for an example of that. Every trick in the book to make you spend 200 bucks a month? How on what ? That's not true even if you had to buy everything they release on the cash shop always. I guess the most expensive months would be when they release a new weaponset in blc but because anet most certainly do not use every trick in the book to get you to pay they made that tradable and generally sell for around 30g a piece when they release meaning you can buy them all for less then 600g which if you had to buy exclusively using real money it would cost less then 40 bucks.
---
Very slow and they have always been like that. Expect 2 or more weeks for almost anything.
---
The fact that you have to ask these questions speaks for itself.
---
&gt; Nobody plays this game only for the story content
---
That's a bold and untrue statement. I agree that the fact that they are neglecting the other gamemodes is killing the game, but I also believe that story and lore are very important for a fantasy world. I wish they balanced it better.
---
The problem is that dungeons were flawed from ground up. The only way to fix them was a full rework, and Fractals happened to be that rework. They were very linear, but with a choice of paths. The problem was, that choice meant the dungeons were completely non-canon. Nothing that happens in them actually happens. None of the characters, unless mentioned outside dungeons, exist. Even the locations don't.
---
The only way to fix dungeons was remove what made them dungeons. So instead, they made that fix into fractals. Dungeons remained popular while they were the best gold farm by far and you were basically forced to run them. Once the gold way nerfed, the only people who would run dungeons are those who truly enjoyed them. As it turns out, by that point the number of those people was very small, and dungeons died.
---
I also thought the voice is hot.
---
Maybe I should commission an artist into drawing Jormag anthropomorphized into a cute anime girl.
---
Don't have to, I learned about my country's past in school and also visited the concentration camp in Buchenwald. Sadly the right political party Alternative für Deutschland (Alternative for Germany) is gaining popularity right now, especially in the eastern parts of the country.
---
Well I had hot for about 10 months now so, guess it just didn't arrive yet, thanks for the answer
---
