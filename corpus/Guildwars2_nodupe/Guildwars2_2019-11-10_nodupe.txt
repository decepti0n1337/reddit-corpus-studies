Yeah, posting balance patch notes early is not communication, and that's essentially what they're doing. Communication is a two-sided process. Screaming the changes with their hands over their ears isn't communication, it's an announcement. And I couldn't care less about early patch notes announcements, they might as well not waste their time with it. Just do it and ignore us later. Don't pretend to value our input and then ignore us, that's so much worse.

Dying. My first time. Terrible commander, not enough people to battle opponents. Chaos. I didn't like it.
---
Killing Blackgate scum. That shit never gets old.
---
Who hurt you?

I'm sure they'll get right on it. Right after they fix charr cultural armor to respect the tail.
---
To be honest, if you can remember and provide a bunch of the account confirming info to them in the initial recovery request (product key associated with the account, date purchased, billing address, etc.) then it can take as little as 12 hours to recover.  If you don't remember any of that or can't look any of it up then it may take a few back and forth emails.
---
Noxxi and that_shaman, follow their twitters too.
---
I don't think it's several hundred miles long, it might be several tunnels interconnected with valleys...we'll never know unless they actually do put those zones in the game and include it on the map(s).
---
To be honest this could be a good main menu aka character's list menu if they decide to change it. It has similar vibe as core/HoT song, starts quietly and then gets more hype with every second.

How hard is it to have multiple characters?
---
This looks great! Do you have the other Polyl infusions/refractors? If yes, how does it look like with the black one?
---
[removed]
---
It's not hard to have multiple characters.  Levelling is pretty painless in this game, and just playing one character will earn you Tomes of Knowledge via login rewards/PvP/WvW/etc. that are free levels that you can give to other characters on your account.  The highest tier of gear, Ascended, is also account-bound, so it can be passed from one character to another through the bank.
---
As for each individual class, you can freely change traits/weapons/etc. within that class anytime you're out of combat, so there is still customization allowed on each character you have.  But while you can turn from a Daredevil Thief wielding a staff into a Deadeye Thief wielding a rifle at the click of a button, that Thief can't turn into a Necromancer, that's where you need another character.
---
Yeah, someone linked it but it was flamethrower mainly. But I'm trying the one with perms might that someone mentioned here. Now I'm farming the gold for that diviner set hahahah
---
Don't stop at 2
---
So first of GW2 is very alt friendly so you're kind of expected to not have a single character but multiple. Each of the professions has a selection of weapons to use that have unique skills for them (1-5 skills). Most professions (what GW2 call the base "classes") can swap between 2 weapons (and the two that can't have other swaps instead) for their main skills, what weapon you use can be swapped out at any time (out of combat). For each of the 9 professions there is one elite specialization per expansion (2 right now). These elite specializations modify the base professions and can be freely swapped once unlocked (at level 80 with hero points). An example of this would be turning allowing the pet based ranger to wield a staff and gain a healing form with the Druid spec. Another example would be letting elementalists use swords, stances, and attune to two elements at once (3rd weapon skill becomes a new mixed skill with different elements) with weaver. 
---
If you created a "mage", lets say elementalist since that's the one that most fits that style of elemental spell caster, you would be stuck as an elementalist. You could change gear, specs, weapons, and skills freely but you would always be an elementalist (or one of it's elite specs). Now if you went weaver you could be an up close sword wielding elemental caster but your profession mechanic just gets changed (dual attunement) not removed. The other elementalist elite spec for example is tempest which gives access to warhorn, shouts, and overloads (staying attuned to an element lets you use a special skill based on that element). Tempest's new traits and skills also allow them to play have healer or support type style.
---
Response to my ticket came about 11 hours later and all they did was send me a password reset email. You fucking fool.
---
There was lay-offs and we're sad so we can't listen to feedback right now.
---
They just sent me a reset email after about 11 hours. No extra security, dumb fuck
---
email answered 11 hours later. All they did was send me a password reset link in my email. fuck you idiots.
---
What do you mean by paying for slots? Do you only get one character slot or something?
---
11 hours later, reset email just sent in response. Fuck you, you moron.
---
Yes, they also have a branch in WoW as well apparently.
---
So people are retarded and I have to deal with it? No, fuck that and fuck you. They reset it after 11 hours with NONE OF THE INFO THEY REQUIRE. Fuck off you stupid subreddit tit sucking losers.
---
So what is the game mostly comprised of if leveling is such a minor component?
---
Reaper I don't know a ton about but it has very high damage in shroud and is absolute ass without, so it's kind of awkward in that sense but can be very strong in short fights. A solid choice tbh. I'm not sure how you fared with mesmer but yeah it used to be worthless outside of utility once upon a time, funny how that changed so much over the years. 
---
As for what you said about solid ocean yeah that's an example we've all experienced but have you solod Lupicus? If so I'm sure you're familiar with how it's basically impossible to reactively dodge the kicks in phase 1 on 200+ ping, you absolutely have to guess them else you'll just get slammed each time lmao. I quit fotm for good about a year and a half ago so I'm hard pressed thinking of good examples from there... especially since they removed mossman as a boss (worst change tbh, he was one of the best bosses).
---
Was your friend working at anet back then? That's interesting if so, I would definitely love to hear stories from him expecially if he had the opportunity to talk with Hrouda and the behind-the-scenes stuff with the original team that worked on dungeons. But yeah tbh I actually really miss those OHKO mobs and bosses because it felt like you actually had to put effort into completing the instances, the only huge problem I felt fotm suffered from was lack of rewards.
---
Also I used to be a warrior only player back then, good times... still find it hilarious how axe 5 is the primary skill of damage when for years it was worse than autoattacking lmao
---
Glad you switched over and are enjoying the game. GW2 has by far been my favorite MMO and I've played many of them since the original EQ days. Sadly however I feel I've lost a lot of interest in it and haven't really played since last Winter's Day events.

---
Hi skirtsan! Thanks for the offer. Do you want me to send a screen shot of my norn warrior to you? How do you want me to send it? Via reddit?
---
I think two or three with the base game and 1 per expansion. I don’t remember the exact numbers, but definitely more than two.
---
My first WvW memory is the vague glob of time where I was trying to get all the stuff for my first world completion as a PvE oriented newbie. I was down to needing like three more vistas, waiting for my server color to rotate for less stress out there, when the update to no longer need WvW map nodes for the GoE hit. Anticlimactic for sure.
---
My fondest memory isn't anything super specific either. Probably running with my fav commander before he transferred servers; he was fun.  
---
I don't really think of (or remember) a lot of WvW content *fondly* so much as I think of it as being satisfying, but a sneaky "take a keep with 3 people" is one of my favorite re-occurring things.
---
culling and getting ran over by a WM blob as they finally rendered after running us over.
---
I've only roamed with it, but sword/sword is really satisfying. It doesn't feel like it would work as well in a zerg, though, so if you prefer zerging staff/hammer may be the way to go. They're both pretty good kits.
---
I can't remember the last time I heard anyone sincerely say something positive about rev shield, but I haven't actually played around with it so I can't criticize it either.
---
I can confirm the above post. Made a 2nd account a few months ago. LS3 and Beetle (and I'm pretty sure Crystal Champion, too) were visible but locked. Got the episodes, unlocked then maxed beetle. I was getting shards up until I completed the Skyscale collection, and started getting them again after maxing that mastery. Still have not unlocked griffon.
---
As a sidenote about LS3 and Crystal Champion: you only need 1 episode to unlock the whole mastery line via entering a map from that season, though getting the other episodes will help with the MPs.
---
Hey, never forget how she complained one time on stream about the menu order in her inventory and an option was added like a week or two later to change it!
---
Power Reaper is actually decent now after years of poor dps. It's also the strongest open world build. Everything melts like butter when playing open world Reaper. 
---
Oh I sucked as mesmer haha. Didn't help that I used the wrong weapons too. After fractals, I got better at mesmer and when I leveled a new mesmer, fared much better. I didn't use mesmer in fractals because the gear cost was insane then, like over 1k gold to gear it. Thank my poorness, spared me from the agony of balance patches. Mesmers get screwed so hard. 
---
I'm not really fond of dungeons. I'm actually in a dungeon guild in order to be more familiar with them. I've done all paths but so far the feeling is... meh. I have soloed fractals before though purely out of curiosity. Doable (provided no mechanics needing more players), but takes forever as I play very defensively. Low man pugs are common too esp when the wait gets too long. 
---
You know, maybe I should give soloing dungeons a try again heh. I remember soloing Caudecus Manor on my Reaper when I was a fresh level 80, it was how I learnt Poison Cloud destroys projectiles xD
---
Where was Mossman as a boss and what made his fight awesome? Do tell! 
---
Nah my friend was a player since the very beginning. He and a few others worked closely with Anet. I don't really remember how that's done but I do remember him saying Anet would implement player suggestions like telegraphs for big attacks. In fact, it was him keep praising the game and Anet that piqued my interest in trying it out. 
---
Years later, I'm still here. My playstyle have changed though, from casual to semi hardcore, then very hardcore (was making a legendary every 2 months), semi hardcore and now I'm a casual again. The game is fine, I just needed to go through my Steam backlog after playing nothing but GW2 for 4 years heh.
---
What did you want? Cake? What part of "need to be checked by a human" don't you understand?
---
I'll reply to the rest of your comment later because I'm about to pass out, but I need to link you to one of my friend's old video from when he used to play. He was pretty much the king of mossman, and the video showcases expertise with dealing with his attacks: https://youtu.be/JVNsE-V7TL8
---
The build is extremely bad tbh. For starters, condition damage is far inferior to power damage in open world. Rifle and dagger dagger are power weapons, not condi. Shortbow is the only weapon thief can use to reliably stack poison. Daredevil is better than Deadeye with condi damage because of the grandmaster trait that makes your dodge roll inflict damaging conditions on nearby enemies while increasing your condi damage. 
---
Sorry but the build is a mess with 0 synergy and 0 damage
---
Tasca's Demise and Witman's folly are the two best tracks from GW1. Fight me.
---
It is Dragon! What do you convinced so many to embrace the ways of Svanir?
---
Speaking of which perhaps you have time to discuss our icy lord and savior Jormag?
---
I legit want to cry happy tears. Hearing this music takes me back to some of the most innocent and fun times of my life. So many fond memories with friends and family playing GW1.
---
Rifle 2 while kneeling immobilizes, which applies 2 stacks of poison per cast due to Panic Strike.  Condi damage in open world isn't the best choice, but saying it has "0 synergy and 0 damage" is pretty dramatic.
---
Oh that's good,
---
I was afraid the pvp is dead...
---
To this day if you log into GW1 you'll hear a piece which I believe is called "overture". Best main menu music ever, if they change the character select screen music they have to change it to some variant of that.
---
I think what they mean by challenging cuz there is never a squad up for it..
---
This ought to be the top post here.
---
*man this reminds me of total annihilation*
---
\*looks it up\*
---
it's the same guy!
---
What's this 1 sec boost for levelling you mentioned? I want it for new characters!
---
I got into GW1 a year or two late, so the only main menu theme I've ever known for that game is the EoTN theme. I have heard the other ones though and in general I like the Eye of the North theme best. Factions is beautiful too, though much more peaceful and situational. The original theme is great in that it really does invoke the feel that it's the start of this epic story.
---
You get a level 80 boost by buying an expansion.  You can also buy them separately in the gem store, but given how easy it is to get Tomes of Knowledge and Experience Scrolls, it's not an efficient use of gems.
---
PvP is alright. You do get queued if that's what you want to know.
---
Ty very much.
---
You say that like actual fashion designers don't wear a lot of blank. Hint: they do.
---
Done it myself by accident. There's lots of boundary issues on TD.
---
Sort of, not sortive, a shame, not ashame. Watermarks are great for preventing people from stealing your shit and posting it other places or using it without permission. I didn't even notice they were there until you mentioned it. Also, misplaced, not missed placed -\_- Sorry, it was just driving me nuts.
---
People constantly talk about how dead it is, but I see plenty of fresh faces in there, and never wait long for a match. I play between 1-5 a day, without issue.
---
Ashford Abbey for me

I did this with permafrost in WvW, I've never been so targeted. \^\_\_\^

---
She's a white rabbit.
---
Factions ost is amazing. I’ll play it through occasionally while playing other games or work. And when I play gw1 I crank the music and hum along.
---
Jeremy soule has a pretty massive collection of work.
---
Gw1 is calling. Come back.
---
There isn't one right answer. it pretty much comes down to 'how much is your time worth'. 
---
If your time is worth a lot, then the quickest way is obviously to just grab it off the TP. But if you don't want to spend gold at all you could be doing leather farm in Lake Doric or something, though it may be more time efficient to just do something like Tier 4 fractals and use the gold earned there (raw gold and from selling all the materials you gain) to then buy mats.
---
Gw2 was dead 2 weeks after launch.
---
Believe it’s the exalted guildhall. Build to ceiling then head east. You’ll run into dry top
---
i cant wait for the "waaaaah i got banned! why???" post
---
Definitely in EoTM when it first came out, running the warrior fall trait that caused a knock back aoe and camping at the koran keep gates and just launching zergs over the edge. My friend and I would rotate positions to have constant aoe knockbacks.
---
To be fair, Regen and Vigor would likely be better suited under Defensive as well.  Pretty sure passive healing isn't utility, neither is having the ability to dodge more frequently.
---
that sounds like its incrementally profitable, and that's not very interesting to me.  If those soil plots are basic stuff, then...meh
---
just like the fix of legendary greatswords on sylvari? xD

Shh! Shh! Just repeat after me...
---
ANET BAD! ANET BAD!
---
GW2 was dead 3 years before launch. GW1 was dead in 1857.
---
I got into Guild Wars well after the sequel and as a result, I never played Eye of the North so this was the first time I have heard the track.  You can't convince me that any other game franchise has better music than Guild Wars, the whole soundtrack it so incredible.

im afraid most gw2 content creators have already left the game — and who could blame them
---
&gt; At wich exact point did I ever say that you or anyone else playing non meta classes isn't a good raider in particular?
---
Literally your first sentence lol
---
&gt; You cannot be a good raider, if you are going to "main" a class, especially on a dps role. Don't even think about it
---
They're magic fish, just like the magic sausages.
---
Take my upvote.
---
Some guilds, most notably [SAND], will run Dry Top Mets runs. In brief, they will lead multiple squads from map reset to farm events and to push the map to T6. [SAND] in particular advertises their schedule on twitter and they are fantastically organized. If you need geodes I recommend running with them, not just for geodes but for how fun their map metas are run.
---
I want the GW eye of the north character selection screen and music back into GW2, but with all the updated models ofc.
---
That'd be beyond amazing for me
---
gw1 soundtrack is spectacular. top 10 video game soundtracks and by far the best work jeremy soule has ever done or will ever do.
---
Thank you much! I will definitely look for something with SSD!
---
It's the best place to learn imo
---
That laptop DOES NOT run this game well at all.  My brother has that exact laptop and it runs GW2 very very poorly.  Why?  Because GW2 is not optimized and only runs on a single core and that laptop has a base clock speed of 2.0 GHZ which is very low for a game like GW2.  When I play on his laptop on lowest settings the fans scream like jet engines and the CPU is railed while the GPU is sitting at around 10-15%
---
Most other, better optimized, games will run just fine on that laptop but 100% not Guild Wars 2
---
Would likely be good for either mercy or courage now that I think about it.
---
A full heal is pretty broken if you can get it off.
---
Either way both of their actives need changing as does a number of traits/skills (weapon and utility) since so many seem repetitive or under tuned.
---
Its far from alone on that front though.
---
As for specific nerfs, I'd say purity of body should probably go.
---
Guard does enough to prevent damage and heal, it shouldn't be boosting endurance regen as well.
---
No you're wrong, Gw1 was never alive at all
---
Well you feed them magic infused food while you're raising them. Also, Aurene ate physical food, too. Joko being one example. You also feed her normal fish during her time as a baby. During one of the story steps where you are training her, she looks at the fish hungrily and you even get one to give to her later for an achievement.
---
Also, skyscales aren't full dragons. Aurene is the only known living dragon, since Vlast is dead, prior to her ascension. Skyscales are lesser dragons with the skyscale being the only known one to actually eat magic. Drakes, wyverns, and hydras also fall under the lesser dragon category.
---
We also don't know canonically if Elder Dragons eat anything at all, besides their consumption of ley energy. Judging by their size, it's probable that they don't.
---
Yea, I guess as much as doping is A-Okay... until you get caught. Please show me where Anet is okay with selling spots and I’ll promptly uninstall because that’s behind asinine if that’s true.
---
The fact that you think there is no foul play when a middle school basketball player suddenly becomes better than every pro NBA player overnight is beyond ludicrous.
---
But no you keep arguing that a guy that was SILVER for at least 15 seasons suddenly becomes so good that he can sit in legendary with a flawless win ratio when at most you can do is duo.
---
Enjoy defending your friends, best of luck to you in the future. Done wasting my time here when you are clearly just trolling me.
---
&gt; They consume and absorb each others magic.
---
No they don't. That only happened as an unintended side effect of having killed an Elder Dragon. In fact, Elder Dragons do not even care about each other let alone bother each other. They just consume what is around them and then go to sleep as the slowly fart out magic.
---
Dunno where you're getting your info but it's not just Elder Dragons that eat magic. Normal dragons do, too. Aurene would eat magic and she wasn't an Elder Dragon until recently. By proxy, Glint and Vlast have the same capacity. Lesser dragons, of which is comprised of skyscales, hydras, wyverns and drakes, for the most part are unable to consume magic. Skyscales being an exception.
---

I'd need to check on the wiki when we first documented the skins as separate pages. I think it was before heart of thorns at least. Anything created after that is probably easy to generate

I (NSP server green) remember walking around and capping various small things like camps, vets, and sentries. Suddenly a wild support firebrand (blue) appeared. He was support because he used healing foods. I let him have the land claimer because I already got my dailies. Showed him I wasn't aggressive by jumping up and down on the spot, he got the message because he turned into a baby dolyak.
---
Right after he capped it I got attacked by a rifle thief (red), and the firebrand (blue) dropped reflects on me and saved my life. We proceeded to slap the thief around before waving and going separate ways. 
---
Too bad we couldn't talk to each other in wvw, could've made a lifelong friend there.
---
I would lure unsuspecting players underwater (in the big lake that used to exist in BL) while i was on my ranger and use the OP underwater ranger skills to beat whole groups...underwater combat was broken back them. 
---
That and being able to rofl stomp anyone that was not a lv 80 with my lv 80. Fun times
---
Where are you getting this from? Life force is a product of magic and it's not consumed as food or actually representative of a beings soul. It's just a magical resource used by Necromancers to fuel specific magic spells. And the only creatures that have ley organs are chakk. The stomach isn't one of them.
---
&gt; In the future, our Skyscales may require more sophisticated magical food sources, especially when they reach adolescence.
---
They already are adults. As babies they ate magic infused meat. As adults they eat fish presumably magically infused as well. And magic. Nothing has changed for them and it won't change either since they can't ascend.
---
We've been asking for fricking legendary armor dye fix for years now, at one point they sorta did something, but went radio silent after. Doubt they'll do anything about Hellfire/Radiant, but one can dream....

Hey all! So I'm loving the game, only a week in and enjoying it, and I'm about halfway there to level 80. Fashion, like I'm sure it is to many of you, is a big deal. I managed to scramble together the norn cultural armor and it's looking great, but the issue is, while I want to look good while doing outdoor content, I simply don't have enough charges to get me by considering the amount of times I'll be replacing my gear, which to be fair isn't TOO much, but it's enough to take up 17 charges if I'm only level 40.
---
So, cool, no problem, I'll wait until level 80. But then my question is, how does gear progression work? Because I've heard most people will go to the trading post and buy a set that has stats pertinent to their build, then... I guess stick with that armor? If so, great, I can transmute it at level 80 and not replace it too much! But if not... should I just rely on outfits instead? If it helps to know, I don't plan on doing any particularly competitive content. I'd like to play it casually, collect stuff, do outdoor content. Maybe a simple trading post set will help me get by in that regard.
---
Thanks!
---
Keeping to the theme of ranged poison, I guess I'd change the equipment set up to be like [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PawAQhjlVwgYHMKmJO2OrvMA-zRRYfhCYG1k/lSOFQkhQxRQHJgBzCMTbA-e), since you're massively overcapped on poison duration by something like 45% more than what you need. Afflicted runes get you a poison-pulsing death nova when you kill stuff, which for open world PvE will be often. Corruption sigil will stack more condi damage stat for you and if you're really serious about poisoning you want a bursting sigil for more condi rather than a force sigil. Also, I added cheap food that costs a combined ~3.5s per half hour to use.
---
As others have said, full zerk power Deadeye with a rifle is going to be more effective than a poisoner build, but I'm guessing you know that already :p
---
Tekkit has great and to the point guides!
---
Also HoD roamer and love it :)
---
they have the bloodline of a dragon but aren't 100% dragons?
---
Yeah the build is not great (that's why we were asking for some opinions to improve it) but so far we had fun with it which is the main goal. We wanted something Condi but to be as far from enemies but also using rifle because it fits the character roleplay and look. Thanks for your opinion I might try shortbow as the second weapon!
---
They eat magic. But I don't think it's been said that they can't eat other things. Saved!
---
Soo you left before they started duo Q eh?
---
Yeah it’s a bit more randomway then before but it’s still around
---
First time, 6 years ago.... when lowies auto-leveled in WvW, culling was a pain in the arse -we mumble against lag now, but culling was the hell!-, queues non stop...
---
Playing with my Bearbow Ranger with DPS build -condi damage wasn't a thing by then-, standing over Klovan's walls, I killed a legit 80 level Warrior. Still not sure if 'cos boredom or what, but I didn't stop hitting him with every LB skill until he died. The rant in PM I got when he cried me, after I told him I wasn't even 80 yet, was epic.
---
It looks super fun but yeah it doesn't have rifle but I'll keep that video for another toon, maybe someone who leads a gang and want to be the top gangster in divinity reach. The reason behind the rifle is because it looks cool, it fits the character and his background that's why it has to be rifle hahahahaha. My husband made some backgrounds for each of his characters so we play according to that since I do the same. He has a princess peach (full pink human wearing a noble gown) who is trying to recover her kingdom that was invaded by a princess from another kingdom.
---
This is interesting, do you have something to share like some slides? or a paper?
---
My favourite GW1 music is Overture from Eye of the North
---
It looks super fun! But I might try it on a different character with a proper background cause this is more for a gang leader or a revolutionary because of thieves guild.
---
Being fair, majority of the balance feedback they receive is a pile of shit from people who tunnelvision balance or repeat buzzwords (*clunky*) and complain without rhyme or reason and any understanding.
---
I will give ArenaNet shit for not going with the profession curators system they wanted to implement years ago (capable players who could represent and summarize voices of class communities for devs).
---
They missed huge opportunities in here, as most of the people I could see as good candidates are gone by now. This could result in projects similar to Xelnath's Council of the Black Harvest during MOP development.
---
I'm a old player returning after ~6 years. I'm looking to get up to date with the expansions. If I buy path of fire expansion (not off gw2 site) will I also get heart of thorns? 
---
I know buying through gw2 site gives me both but it's a lot more expensive.
---
Yes you'll get HoT when you buy PoF through non-ANet sites. But please make sure you get it from a [legit retailer:](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/l) -- [DLgamer](https://www.dlgamer.com/en/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43768) is what most people use for cheaper GW2 :)
---
You could farm Dragonfall and use the gold you gain to buy it. If you're using runecrafter for green gear and silver fed for yellows you'll also get a little leather, but most importantly optimal gold value. Mystic salvage kits can be used instead of the silver fed. Copper fed can be used for greens and blues. Save exotics to be used with black lion salvage kits or sell them on the tp.
---
Awesome, will buy through that link now. 
---
Thanks.

**PvP/WvW**

If you play PvP or WvW, reward tracks are the best way to obtain exotic armor and weapons with Core/Extended, Heart of Thorns, or Path of Fire stats.

These provide *stat-selectable* armor pieces:

**Living World Achievements**
---
Since Heart of Thorns, most Living World episodes have had at least one achievement that provides stat-selectable exotic armor:
---
Living World Season 3 (Core/Release, Core/Extended, and Heart of Thorns stats)
---
- Out of the Shadows: head
---
- Rising Flames: shoulders + a head from Maintain Aurene's Shield
---
- A Crack in the Ice: hands
---
- The Head of the Snake: head
---
- Flashpoint: shoulders
---
- One Path Ends: feet
---
Living World Season 4 (Core/Release, Core/Extended, and Path of Fire stats)
---
- Daybreak: head
---
- A Bug in the System: shoulders + 2 backpieces from Repairing/Rebooting IG-6417
---
- Long Live the Lich: chest
---
- All or Nothing: legs
---
I strongly recommend not getting acer
---
The only widespread public dpsmeter is arcdps  and technically yes, using it is against user agreement (it gathers information for the game in the improper way), but a specific exception for it was made. Which, as we can see now, can be recalled at any time.
---
off. i hate those outlines around chars when selecting them
---
&gt; They just, frankly, aren't just as important
---
This is the most absurd statement I've heard in a while. You can neglect high tier - because with enjoyable low tier gameplay players will continue playing the game, get better, become high tier and will evolve meta that fits low-tier balance, but requires high-tier skill. It doesn't work the other way. If you balance only/mainly for high tier, then new players are not staying in gamemode, you bleed players on the base. High tier players will bleed out slower, regardless of balance - due to burnout and other issues. That's straight way to quick death of gamemode, at some point you just don't have players anymore. Even in competitive gamemodes is just straight better to have big bottom level of playerbase.
---
What isbrhe alliances update?
---
Will it be a new expension (then i'll probably wait, because i need to buy FOH too)
---
Or just a regular patch?
---
I play with gw2 uninstalled
---
Ded gaem
---
My pre-HoT goal was to 100% the activity achievements. Got it done, but not without burning out my gf; she didn't play for almost a year after that :\
---
off, no one likes blue outlines
---
This should be at least in the character selection menu.
---
No, they get to higher tier and stop playing, because the game is not balanced and fun anymore. GW2 doesn't have enough build diversity for a pleyer-driven, evolving meta.
---
&gt;**use at own risk**
---
&gt; We also don't know canonically if Elder Dragons eat anything at all, besides their consumption of ley energy. Judging by their size, it's probable that they don't.
---
the closest we have is mordremoth "eating" the floating islands at the end of the dragon's stand chain, but whether or not that could be classified as food consumption, I'm not sure.
---
ArcDps is the mainly accepted dps meter among the fractal/raid community. It is not against the ToS, nor was there a "special exception" made for it, as that only applies to the ArcDps build templates that have been disabled and abandoned. ArcDps is a third party addon, so you're always using it at your own risk, but afaik no one has ever had any problems with the dps meter other than game crashes if you don't update the dps meter after a new game update.
---
&gt; Well you feed them magic infused food while you're raising them. Also, Aurene ate physical food, too. Joko being one example.
---
Isn't Joko technically also magic-infused food?
---
So not the same as what OP was asking about.
---
I think anybody who only plays PvP will be more likely to think of how dumb this post is.
---
Well those island are made from leystone, which i guess is somewhat like an amalgamation of minerals and leystone crystals. He's after the magic for sure
---
You can get a free diviner set from acheivemnts
---
Been playing with on till release of Grothmar Valley, after that off. Had same issue like OP. That bloom effect makes my eyes bleed.
---
was playing mesmer with a small group of guildies (5 or 6 people), and were roaming around. we were going around a tower or something and I decided to put a veil just before the corner. as we turn the corner, suddenly we were all invisible, in the middle of an enemy group (also 5 or 6 people). it took us a couple of seconds to see what was happening, before we killed them all.
---
&gt;They already siphoned devs once and they might do it again. 
---
They in this case being Mike O'Brien, who left because NCSoft stepped in and stopped him from doing just that.
---
Thanks for the tale! An interesting read for sure. When communities start to fall apart like that, especially established ones, it is always really sad and unfortunately it tends to start a snowball effect.
---
Off. I mostly enjoy the shaders and things - but the outlines around characters you mouse over or look at I simply can’t stand to the point I had to turn it off entirely.
---
The feeling, and act, of discovery can rarely be beaten!
---
In the beta my battles tended to end up being zerg battles actually but yeah sometimes it was a bit more widespread and "disorganized". The zergs I feel have always been apart of WvW though. The stacking up before charges and so on, which I personally enjoyed. I don't know really how WvW is today but I have fond memories of defending different fortifications to keep vital trebs alive as well as targeting fortifications to bring down enemy trebs.
---
Doing Obsidian Sanctum must have been pretty easy if you could win all of your 1v3 though :D
---
Oof, yeah that was hell!
---
Ah, the ignorant and toxic redditor. Hi.
---
On
---
I like ambient colors and bloom, though sometimes bloom is too powerful.
---
I can imagine! Those types of clutch situations can be nerve wracking and therefore really rewarding when you succeed.
---
The real question is: how long until you notice it's still off after you turned it off for something like the Liadri fight?
---
Because touch da fishy
---
You'll actually have to point it out to me, because I genuinely don't see how your slander and my alternative are related in any way whatsoever.
---
You will get way more charges, after playing a while, then you could ever spend, esp. if you play WvW or sPvP every once and a while
---
You know, the great thing about Guild Wars 1 is that, barring the total collapse of NCSoft and Arenanet, I don't think it's ever going anywhere.
---
They've admitted that due to the way it's built as a game/the systems they put in place in the final days, it takes up drastically little server space and is built in such a way that it can essentially run itself indefinitely, and it's dirt-cheap for them to keep it up and running.
---
if you buy only the cheapest food for salvage and mats needed for the seeds to plant, via buy order from the tp, you should make profit esp. if you use crafting poster.
---
I always really really wanted use a longbow cause of all the amazing skins but simply dont enjoy ranger. Never really looked into warrior lb cause it seemed kinda lackluster. Maybe I should give it a try
---
What will your friend be using the system for? Only gaming, or also school. Will he be using a desktop monitor when hes at home?
---
Well I guess they have to up their fucking game to deserve that money.
---
I'd err mostly on the side of incompetent.  I'd argue *most* people aren't great at their jobs, but there are the few that are that you notice when they leave.  This can be a great programmer, or a great leader that keeps people together and productive
---
Oh. I don't know. I'm torn on that. I prefer to treat them as different entities. Guild Wars 2 is what it is and it's fine at that. Guild Wars 1 was different. Artistically. Tonally. As a game. They're just different beasts.
---
It's like comparing Indie Music to Popular Music, and I make no judgement in saying that. Guild Wars 1 was more experimental. The stories felt... Different? How to put this.....
---
Oh! I know! Guild Wars 2 feels like Epic Fantasy, Guild Wars 1 feels like Swords and Sorcery. Guild Wars 2 feels closer to Skyrim, Guild Wars 1 to Morrowind, if that makes any sense?
---
I mean. Look at Guild Wars 1's plots. You are an Ascalonian Adventure. The Searing happens. You need to flee to Kryta and work with The White Mantle until you discover they are evil. You join the Shining Blade. Eventually you become caught up in the grand machinations of Liches and Titans and have to end the game by killing them all.
---
In Factions, You are a new student at a storied Island Monastery that trains the great heroes of Cantha. As your studies continue, mysterious happenings lead to the discovery of a plague sweeping the nation. After fighting it back on the Island, you move to the mainland where it's wrecking everything. You discover the spirit of an ancient and vengeful Canthan warrior is unleashing the plague and you have to unite various forces to defeat him.
---
In Nightfall, you're this junior officer type figure in a Paramilitary organization that polices Elona. One of the nations' leaders is consorting with Demons. You start a campaign to stop her. After a series of defeats and a guerrilla war waged against her, you start unlocking ancient secrets and mysteries to better combat her, eventually travelling to the realm of an evil God to stop the demons completely.
---
In EoTN, rumblings beneath the earth cause local leaders to ask you to go see what is happening underground. A dwarf and the first Asura we ever meet (who is sassy af) are like "Pssh. Nothing to worry about, Human. We're just dealing with a Destroyer Infestation" "A what now?" "Uh oh. We need to get out of here. Now."
---
You learn about destroyers, discover that Gwen is still alive (It's really weird if you play as a Prophecies Character, and I sorta wish she did more to acknowledge that you and her already knew one another, beyond vaguely mentioning it if you collect the right miscellaneous items) and you have to unite various factions and new races to beat the Destroyers.
---
Then the game closed with helping Salma overthrow the White Mantle and retake the Krytan Throne, and Cantha going all super xenophobic and sealing themselves off from the world. I like to think those two endings actually showed the two sides of how humanity would/wanted to deal with new races showing up (Well. The Norn were always just doing Norn shit, but the Charr were winning Ascalon, the Asura moved into Rata Sum, etc.) The Krytans are all "Well okay. Maybe we can get these tiny grey magi-technicians to help us beat the Mursaat. "Psssh. Of course we can find a way to counteract Spectral Agony, Bookah. We're Asura." It actually deeply annoys me that there wasn't more significance put on the Asura/Mursaat relationship. Rata Sum is an Anagram of Mursaat, but more than that. The White Mantle/Mursaat lost the battle of Lions Arch largely because of the Asura. Without their involvement, the Rebels would have beaten the Mantle, but when Mursaat started showing up using Spectral Agony, it'd be over.
---
Look at me ramble.
---
The Guild Wars 2 Stories just seem much more direct and epic (Except maybe in the case of Nightfall) Prophecies and Factions both had this mysterious, discovery-type quality to them that I don't think GW2 has captured, or ever tried to, really.
---
It's fine at what it does, but GW1 has a very special place in my heart.
---
You know, I just made a massive post trying to describe why GW1 feels different to me, and you did it in one sentence.
---
It really is just faster pacing.
---
Good thing no one was around to hear the noise I made when reading your comment x'D
---
It's balthy's outfit from the loot boxes I think
---
Haters gonna potate
---
It seems both Divines share one trait. The God of Secrets ruled over the liquid element... And that power should have gone to Kormir, right? RIGHT? Well, it seems that wasn't the case and the charge fell onto the hands of the Goddess of Illusion. Strange that we had two gods of conceit at the same time.
---
According to the lore, Lyssa is a combination of Lyss and Ilya, but what if there's more to it than that? What if one of them was Abaddon? What if both are minions of the only Elder Dragon we know nothing about and shares their sphere of influence? What if they are the Elder Dragon using ilusions?
---
Thanks for reading my Wild-eyed Miller-esque post, redditors!
---
&gt; How a programmer can code professionally AND have great social skills?
---
Being professional requires social skills.
---
I wouldn't quite say it's *just* the faster pacing, but it is definitely one of the biggest aspects. The open world vs private instances is also a major contributor in a variety of ways. GW1's limited movement also makes the world feel bigger and more immersive.
---
Honestly, you should continue with your post, there is a ton of aspects to be considered, it's really quite fascinating.
---
If you add them as friends after the game you can see their rank on the leaderboard thingy.
---
Regular patch, no plans right now for any paid expansions.
---
Sometimes in gamedev stuff just gets dragged around and out of the way in level design, I bet some of that is due to something that just should have been deleted and wasnt.
---
I got map completion on TD by falling through part of the map to get to an area you needed a mastery to get to.
---
Not my type of person to watch for more than a minute.

Post up in LFG, you'll fill a party much quicker.

---
This is my Build. I am totally going against the grain (which usually ends in me being downvoted) and say that power scrapper is totally viable as dps in T4 Fractals.
---
you will have really good survivability. i am usually the last one standing when the group wipes. lately Thaumanova Anomaly was no problem to solo after the group wiped at 50%.
---
The cleave is unbelievable good. In groups of trash mob Arc shows dps up to 75k dps.
---
the burst on bosses is usually around 50k dps and then drops to around 25-30k. And i am not even using the kits, only for toolbelt skills. So you cant even mess up your rotation. you just have to spam on Cooldown. Hammer 3 and 4 are not used in the rotation. They are emergency skills.
---
for Elite i am using Artillery Barrage as an opener since i play Charr. Supply Crate is also a good CC and support. But the Elites are all not that nice.
---
edit: if you want to see it in action you can message me ingame Doviculus.9623
---
At the moment they are not against the TOS. The thing is, the program is made by someone who does not work for Arenanet. If say they update it with fishy software and you get hacked, it is at your own risk and Arenanet is not responsible nor will they compensate you. That being said, the person who made ArcDPS is very respected by the GW2 community. I cannot speak for other DPS meters though.
---
Then dont tell other ppl to not watch her cus you though shes always like that mr JuanPunch_0.
---
“You never get a second chance to make a first impression.” Experts say: 55 percent of first impressions are made by what we see (visual). 38 percent is the way we hear your first words (vocal).

9 Reasons Why Making Assumptions is Dangerous- https://medium.com/thrive-global/9-reasons-why-making-assumptions-is-dangerous-345e8b24008c

* Do **not** get an Acer. Trust me.
---
* This laptop will **not** run GW2 well even at the _lowest_ settings
---
* Look for a laptop with a powerful processor and if you can, get one with an SSD or swap the HDD with one, the loading screens will be **much** shorter
---
* Go to r/SuggestALaptop if you need laptop advice
---
NA
---
Always Off. The bloom is idiotically high and morons that leave the aviator goggles on loot boxes
---
I bet this asshat just revived and is chilling in his mausoleum and watching the world burn and laughing that his psychotic cousin Zhaitan has died
---
There's no way to perfectly narrow down someone's skill level to a single number. It's an approximation used to attempt better matchmaking and ranking. That approximation is a lot worse at ranking somebody's skill level when they're as unbalanced and volatile as a brand new player. Throwing all responsibility onto a system that is literally impossible to perfect is why I called it disrespectful. There's no way you don't know you're ruining other's experience on a whim.
---
Cool story. Not a fan of her. Accept it.
---
Wow, I never knew you could do that, that's actually really cool! I'll definitely be throwing some Eye of the North music in there next update then
---
You should make mention that you're RPing then in your description then.
---
Off, player and NPC outlines weird me out.
---
Get them into PvP via unranked first. Unranked also lets you party up with more people so you can give him a better experience.
---
go play your pokemon game :)
---
There's some people who still do it regularly, but since everyone tries to get in on it, most people end up left out after they use up all the space in one map.
---
Why would I watch 50 minutes to 2 hours long videos about 2 minutes trailers? 
---
There are many other video channels that cover lore in extreme details in a more cohesive way and in span of 15 minute videos. 
---
And that applies to his entire youtube library. Just my 2 cents.
---
This entire thread is about laptops.  You don't start seeing desktop processors in laptops until you're spending like $2,000 USD lol
---
I just started a tag (mentor would even work) and tell people they can drop a valuable item. I believe they can drop a tonic which is quite expensive, might have to look it up.
---
People always come when money is lurking.
---
Looks pretty flat without.
---
Teal is best. Looks like a Green Destroyer from LS3
---
I can go if you need right now. I'm not doing anything
---
Yeah and that laptop is fine, it'll boost to a respectable level.
---
Can't you just bypass that with gold?
---
They might not be able to. The situation with Jeremy Soule got pretty sour I think (due to his being a massive wanker) and being able to distribute GW1 music anywhere outside that game has been an uphill battle. Getting it on their SoundCloud was a miracle and I'm not sure we can expect a repeat.
---
I don't like that you can't disable the postprocessing outlines separately, but they come in handy to point out things you need to find and activate when they do not have object names, and I dislike the excessive bloom effect, but generally the game looks better with it and it doesn't affect performance much, so I usually leave it on.
---
I still want to be able to adjust the bloom effect and to disable the outlines whenever I want.
---
Also, I want to be able to keep different settings for PvE open world, PvE instanced, WvW and PvP.
---
Is this supposed to be funny?
---
its time for official dps meter, its already in the game , just use it outside of golem. Now downvote my shitters, I know you will. You are afraid of dps meters only because one reason, you are afraid people will finally knew how bad you are. You dont know your rotation, and never plan to learn it right? This is why I am wiping and wiping on all the content, because I get players like you to my team. God damn leachers who dont want to put any work into the game. die
---
Do t1 daily, u will easy get to fl20
---
You don't have to fight the four djinn for the skyscale collection. Just talk to the air djinn after you draw them out
---
B-b-but flavor!
---
LOL, just LOL! Hopefully reddit will still exist by that time :D
---
It depends on how it obtains its data, what data it obtains, and how that data is used.
---
Most popular 3rd party tools are TOS complaint, but remember that no third party tool is without risk.
---
From the story beats, I gathered that it was because of Mordremoth and Zhaitan were defeated.  They tend to absorb given types of magic.  Kralkatorrik suddenly being flooded with death and life magic pushed him away from sane.  When he was present and absorbed part of Balthazar's magic, it was the straw that broke the dragon's back, so to speak.  
---
In the final fight inside Kralk, the dialogue indicates how fractured his mind had become.
---
I feed mine magic blue mushrooms, so I guess that counts.
---
Thanks for your service
---
Sieht man das?
---
Everything in the world has a little magic in it.
---
calling what the golem provides a DPS meter is far fetched. there is more to a decent one than a basic accumulated number every 25% of a mob's health.
---
Fish = magic 
---
Steve confirmed for next xpac.
---
And my axe!
---
Oh the wvw sounds good,
---
Havent tried the mounts yet
---
Sounds awesome
---
are you going to cho con?
---
:pepegacrab:
---
maybe next year:)
---
Proper records peepoHappy
---
He can only regenerate his health four times, after which there are no more humans left for him to consume.  So if you're really stubborn you'll still be able to get through it.
---
&gt; We ended up testing Mirages, Condi Weaver and also attempted to drop the Condi Soulbeast for another Firebrand but the results were worse due to the loss of Sun Spirit
---
Do you have a guess on how much dps a sun spirit with this comp provides?
---
Great kill.
---
I done skritt 2 days ago, the wiki has a list of locations
---
Oh. I kept seeing humans respaw so i just assumed. I think I gave up at his 4th heal. This is great info. Thanks!
---
https://i.imgur.com/QTID1NZ.jpg
---
&gt; Optional open-world PvP should be introduced to the series.
---
You lost me there.
---
&gt; No mounts!
---
You lost me there the second time.
---
Let it go, random person on the Internet - the world has changed, the time of WoW pacing has passed, and the already struggling genre of MMO ain't going back to GW1.5 regardless of its graphics.
---
It's a UI bug everyone has right now. Gotta wait for it to be patched.
---
I don't think they should keep respawning, unless you're getting out of combat and resetting the encounter, which is technically possible with the room being pretty big.  I might be wrong, though, I can't say I've ever tried to solo the encounter... I think I did it duo once.
---
gray looks pimp
---
Or use Arcdps.
---
It's not an expansion.
---
What's the rainbow effect from?
---
I'd much rather the next game in the series be an open world single player rpg (or two player online) with multiple races and classes that would warrant multiple playthroughs/combos. ArenaNet is best at creating worlds, beautiful zones and story, that's what they should stick to. Not having to worry about repeatable end game, different game modes, balance, etc.
---
nice one :D
---
Yup, started couple of hours ago, in middle of bounty run.
---
It wouldn't be the same, since most of the effects also change your skin color. Might look interesting on sylvari though.
---
Off.
---
It's SAGA, not a season duh..
---
Yeah started a couple of days ago.. pretty anoying
---
sword dagger ele, sword holo
---
Was just making a Haiku.
---
For what it's worth, the competition for tournaments is pretty good. The months of no Monthly Ats have been bad but rapidfiring them every 2 weeks has been really good.
---
If you think that golem have really what's needed for a Dps meter attach to it, you dont really know what's needed for a good dps meter...
---
Doing the damage dealt divide by the time you are in combat is not everything you need for a damage meter...
---
Considering mounts are one of the few things that everyone agrees are fantastic, no, that would be dumb.
---
Eh, it's a real shame that the Juggernaut's footfalls have been bugged since forever
---
Thank you for you quality shitposts!
---
Is there gonna be a reminder post?
---
Okay buddy. Caaaaalm your tities all tiers in gw2 PvP are trash dw about it ( this was plat 2 btw so yes trash)
---
That's how Tera does it as well.
---
So if you're like me, the difference between getting this joke and not getting it is the brightness setting on your phone.
---
Light Aura, that screenie is taken shortly after pulling out my justice tome and that gives light aura.
---
Mounts weren't a mistake ( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉)
---
Yeah, my guild never has those salt outbursts after a lost fight, we simply regroup and move on. Also we would often respectfully discuss what went wrong and how we can improve.
---
Why are you so aggressive? Just disagree with me if you want, I don't care.
---
People like you are the reason this subreddit is so damn toxic.
---
The most action these days is on weekly reset (teams are scored, everyone is kicked out, and the map resets to neutral). It happens at roughly 6pm on Fridays PST. Not sure if that time works for you but if possible check it out.
---
All the WvW guilds will be standing at the portals in lions arch waiting for it to open and it always feels super hype. There will be lots of commanders on all the maps and tons of fights to be had.
---
I noticed that... is there some difference? I figure from a gameplay perspective there isn't,  but figured I would ask.
---
They just said you lost their support for your idea with those two components of it, and suggested your assumptions of what constitutes a successful MMO are out of date. Nothing about that is aggressive.
---
Your response to that mild criticism, however, most certainly *is*.
---
It sounds cooler
---
I actually kek'd audibly. Good meme, friend.
---
Honestly I wish they could have abandoned GW2 and attempt success with another game (if it isnt mobile) at this point.
---
I still enjoy the new releases but seeing the studio slowly dying is just sad.
---
&gt;Where are you getting this from? Life force is a product of magic and it's not consumed as food or actually representative of a beings soul. It's just a magical resource used by Necromancers to fuel specific magic spells.
---
More than necromancers can use it. Necromancers can use **another's** lifeforce, but any magic user can use their own life force:
---
* In Sea of Sorrows, during the final battle against the risen fleet of Captain Whiting and The Maw, Prince Edair's ship has a group of guardians casting defensive spells, and at one point they begin to die because they used up too much of their own lifeforce to maintain the barriers.
---
* Similarly, Koro Sagewind from GW1 tapped into her life force twice to create a more powerful spell - the first time left her blind for a week, the second time [cost her life](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Founding:_Volume_XV) after leaving her blind and bleeding.
---
That said, saying "lifeforce, soul, and spirit are just terms for magic" is more than unfounded. They can be used to fuel magic, yes, but that's the closest they get to each other. It certainly isn't "a product of magic" either though.
---
"Open world PvP" is something I've never understood being appealing. I don't get satisfaction from ruining the experiences of others, so I see no real benefit to having it.
---
I would hardly call what he stated "aggressive". He's stating the obvious point that you are looking at Guild Wars through narrow-band, rose-colored glasses and not considering how bad the state of the MMO market is in right now. Evolution of Gaming has occurred, and archaic models and concepts have been left to the wayside. You're not unlike the Eve Online players demanding an Eve 2 because they never want to train for the Capital Ship meta and want a return to 20v20 battleship brawls. What *you* want, or even worse what you *think* you want is about as much of a defining point in game development as you are in the real material universe: just one of infinite insignificant points of dissonance.
---
Now, if you want aggressive I could always hit you with the " Fight me like you wanna bite me, you brainless zombie fuck."
---
I like it normal to be honest. I know it is a weird opinion from an infusion addict lover :D
---
Humans could channel the spirits and fight using their powers in Eye of the noth..
---
Still remember farming domain of anguish using the Ursan way ahah.
---
Ah, I wasnt sure if it was canon, so I just said headcanon to be sure.
---
It may be that Elder Dragons have developed more sophisticated techniques to extract magic from life forms than Skyscales and baby/adolescent Aurene that simply eat directly.
---
Just Bloodstone Fen &amp; Mist Trinkets (PvP/WvW + FoTM Jewelry).
---
Oh, I wasn't using Juggernaut during the trail picture, so it wouldn't overlap the hellfire trail. The Juggernaut puddles work for me.
---
Heh I'd be ok for racials skill to be available to every race and be acquired by doing a related quest if it isn't your starting race.
---
This way they could become usable..
---
Well I can't argue that it does sound cooler lol
---
Man DOA Ursanway was so fun. We would make a whole line and just march forward destroying everything and protecting the back up monks.
---
We didn't join the Shining Blade, we just took the same oath they take so we don't spill their secrets
---
A Mousepad
---
Now available: Remove annoying star - only 200 gems
---
ok, thanks
---
Only this.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Capacitor
---
Mist trinkets can be obtained in Fractals, WvW and PvP, and are not unique equipped, meaning you can equip a character fully with them.
---
When bought from WvW and PvP they only take tradable materials as currency, so they are also faster than Bloodstone trinkets. Just a tad more expensive.
---
Remember to remove all upgrades from your trinkets before changing their stats, since the capacitors are bugged and they do not always reset the stats in the item, they will sometimes 'reforge' the item instead, giving you a new copy of the item instead resetting the stats in the old item, and thus losing all upgrades in  the old item.
---
"If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck..."

Now that's quality shitpost

Agreed. GW2 was only necessary because GW1 was fundamentally mechanically limited by its on base. Level 20 cap, simplistic inventory setup and 8 man group dynamics meant that GW1 could evolve going forward. It is why they released GW2 in the first place: increase the power crutch sensation by a higher level cap, dynamic skill bar based on weapon logout, varying content in PvP and Pve, including solo content. These were all things that were lacking in GW1 and the reason behind certain features and additions such as Hero NPCs and Green weapons. Right now, GW2 isn't suffering my a mechanical limitation, it's suffering from a content limitation. ArenaNet is struggling to put out content fast enough to keep their players engaged, and we can only recycle old content so much before we are done. Right now I'm enjoying grind up my personal fractal level so I can join groups in higher fractals, but I'm sure someone that has run daily T4s is bored to death of the same fractal instances. All Anet needs to do is expand a little in every direction and the player base will be mostly happy: a new raid wing, a new fractal instance, maybe a new sPvP map and a new reward line for WvW.

As of yet we don't really know. It could just be a unique name for Season 5 (like how Season 1 is sometimes called "Scarlet's War"), or it could be referring to more than just Season 5 (like how Season 1-HoT was its own plot, then Season 3-Season4 was another individual plot; I've seen some folks calling them "the Mordrem Saga" and "the Aurene Saga" respectively).

---
it is easy to do it solo, if you have some cc
---
Maybe sagas specifically center around someone or something while seasons are about an event or something?
---
holosmith vs Dragonhunter:
---
1. ↓ Bursts less often
---
2. ↓ Bursts for less
---
3. ↑ Cleaves a bit better, but that's not really that relevant
---
4. ↔ Has more cc, but the cc is a part of rotation, not an extra
---
5. ↓ Can't be stacked for perma quickness on their sub, while DH can just drop dragon's maw for "feel my wrath" elite (3 DHs is enough to upkeep quickness on good groups)
---
6. ↓ "harder" rotation
---
7. ↑ sustains more dps outside of burst
---
8. ↑ has a more interactive rotation
---
9. ↑ can provide group stealth, fire fields and blast finishers.
---
Keep in mind that a good holosmith will consistantly beat mediocre DHs, as long as the holo player knows both the fight and the class
---
Downvoted for answering question yeah this makes sense.
---
Which, for a presumably newish player who hasn't levelled crafting skills yet, qualifies as "pretty expensive", I think.
---
I need a Saga. What's the Saga? It's songs for the deaf. You can't even hear it.
---
It ain't life force though. They died because magic in this world IS life. It's basically mana in other fantasy genres. Like mana was to Tales of Symphonia.
---
It's basically a primordial building block to everything, even reality itself. It's not anyone's soul as souls don't die unless consumed and even then, if the creature that consumed it is killed, the soul is set free.
---
It certainly *could* mean that, but like I said, ArenaNet has given us nothing beyond a name, while sometimes, infrequently, saying "it's not Season 5" even though it completely is except in name.
---
Off, I have sensitive eyes and prefer more muted colors.
---
GW2 ran fine for 5 years without mounts. The only reason mounts were needed because they gave us less wp's and bigger maps.
---
OFF all the time because reshade/sweetfx is superior to Anet’s shaders.
---
Did you miss the optional bit?
---
Because everything on reddit is true
---
No need to be so aggressive.
---
They can’t do a GW3 without something I’ve called the Rockstar treatment. Shitty monetization, low quality pc port, delayed content without communication... Basically, with how they have treated players in GW2, Anet has made sure I will never touch one of their future games... same with Rockstar, EA...
---
CTRL+SHIFT+H will make it go away ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
you are right probably :D
---
I'm guess they will be one quest at a time type of updates. We arent going to get a chunk of story with new maps for these
---
if you pull the boss to the middle you should have time to break it alone
---
use multi-hit attacks..can't say more without knowing your class
---
It’s prolly a goat.
---
Took me a hot minute to get this one. Well played.
---
Geese have been all the rage lately
---
Thankfully I got my mini from the guy who was handing out a pile of codes here on reddit, all without having to fly 12 hours to the nearest restaurant and getting a food poisoning!
---
off. even on low it's way too intense and you can't see shit.
---
nah they'll probably buff it to the point it outperforms mirage at largos or something
---
You're going to have a very bad time with that thing if you try to run GW2 on it. The biggest red flag is the lack of decent GPU and no, a GT 710 is not "decent."
---
You're best bet is to ask on r/buildapc or /r/buildapcforme. Be sure to follow their posting guidelines and have a budget in mind if you do ask there.
---
Ah, neat. Thought it was an infusion or something.
---
Holokralk was from this year's Dragon Bash, not the first Dragon Bash in 2013. I don't know where you're pulling "legacy code" from.
---
Server and client crashes, mostly.
---

---
You'll probably be able to run the game bearably in low-populated core maps on lowest settings, but you can forget about any bigger group events or WvW entirely. 
---
You can, however, buy a used GTX 770 or similar for 50 bucks and slap it on there. I have mostly the same specs and the game runs fine on med-high.
---
GT710 is what it says.
---
Postprocessing OFF - GW2Hook ON.

This way game looks insanely beautiful and sharp.

i'm sure it could have as much content.  
---
it's still not an expansion.

Now this is just packed with amazing stories! They brought a smile to my face :D. Incredible that you found the love of your life here as well, congratulations on that \^\^.

cuz ur baby is different :3
---
That's so true, if you don't play the exact meta build, you can not compete at higher Elo. There are some. Exceptions but for the most part you play one meta bud per class
---
Sounds chaotic haha :D

Agreed about staff, sword/gs, disagree about longbow, it's basically a worse scepter.

Merciful intervention only teleports you if you a friendly target to teleport towards.
---
Sneaky captures do have a special flair to them :D
---
Did not end it. It only made BG stronger.
---
First memory was joining on Mesmer and wondering why the entire map was green and nobody was at spawn or outside it. Actually there was nobody really on the map at all on any side. T8 sure was fun.
---
I'm still confused as to how I enjoyed playing it.

Mad props for the Misfits skull &amp; craft beer selection!

How do you use torch 4 on fb? 
---
When you press torch 4, do you throw it straightaway or wait 3 seconds then throw it? Does this even matter?
---
I noticed nightmare presses torch 4 waits a bit then uses it twice when the trait torch 4 activates.
---
But I saw a benchmark video where they wait till the trait torch 4 triggers then spam both torch 4s straightaway.
---
Eh, I grew with it also and always thought it was the worst part.

Open world PVP can go die in a fire along with poor camera controls.

I have had multiple Acers with zero trouble for years. Same with quite a lot of my friends. Branding is not an issue with computers anymore imo. Same parts inside all of them anyways.
---
And there is alot to do ! Enjoy the leveling ! (I find IT best to set some goals and write them down and Explore the wiki to find stuff to do, also chilling with Spotify and some silverwaste is just fine ❤️
---
This game still have no gear tread mill. We have vertical progression which means when you get the expansion you will get access to masteries, this you collect whilst playing the game. 
---
Gear have not changed the stats on ascended gear then is still the highest stats now. We do have legendary gear but just as then it is about statswap and looks. 
---
Builds have ofc changes, traitlines and stats combinations, and we also got 2 new elite specs for each profession. This came with the expansions. Mounts and gliding is also expac thing.
---
Lots of new things maps, raids, fractals, adventures, stories, festivals and everything else will keep you occupied for a long time.
---
Make sure to get your old account because you have birthday presents for each character you own and around year 3-7 you get some nice gifts with it. 
---
Imo i would start a new character and level a bit and relearn the ropes. You don't need expansions for that. We all still level in the core game. When you get the expansion you buy Path of Fire and get Heart of Thorns for free. Seasons you might want to get as well. season 3 and 4 have 12 new maps all together and a lot of content and collections and other things to do.
---
Wow OK sounds like lot fun will get straight into it
---
Hmm. Thinking over this a bit more, did [Grawnk](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grawnk) ever get bugged out like this (showing up after Wintersday was over)?

I've seen it happen at a struggling franchise (ones already financially on a downward slope), but those franchises don't tend to last long after they start making those decisions.  A place like Quiznos will have corporate hired inspectors visiting on a semi-regular basis (possibly as often as once a month) and there's no way they'll continue passing after that, and they will eventually be forced in to paying fines and/or have their franchise rights stripped away.  It definitely wouldn't be a company wide policy, so "never eating at Quiznos again" is an overreaction.

Warrior can come pretty close to their mobility level tbh, as can Mirage mesmer and any melee ranger.  Mesmer does it through numerous teleports combined with certain ambushes, particularly sword mainhand.  Warrior becomes extremely mobile when using a combination of greatsword and sword/warhorn as well as some of its more gap-closing physical or rage skills (if berserker).  Ranger sword has Monarch's Leap and Hornet Sting which are great mobility skills, as well as Swoop on greatsword and utilities like Lightning Reflexes that can make it pretty mobile.  Revenant also has a series of shadow step and gap closing options that can make them equally good at harrying a target.
---
When I'm running a low stealth, high evasion based thief roaming in WvW (either staff or sword/dagger) these are the main classes that I have to watch for because they are the best ones at catching me if I give up on the fight and make an attempt to escape for one reason or another.  They are also my favorite alternatives to playing thief (minus warrior... I just really can't get in to playing it for some reason).
---
There are definitely not very many places where longbow shines on Dragonhunter, but in WvW and particularly in roaming there are scenarios where it does outclass scepter for kiting ONLY because of its range advantage, albeit really just for plinking with the auto-attack as all of its strongest hits require either your opponent or you stay still.  That said, I don't really know anyone who roams as a Guardian these days, and tbh most people are gonna just want to run Firebrand in WvW.
---
was  a question
---
Off. It helps me see circles in WvW. When it's on it tends to blend a lot of colors together and creates a chaotic view.
---
oh the appearance, thought it was something functional;  thanks
---
magic what, now? Lol xD
---
I prefer the 'rainbow in the dark' but you know.
---
Oh geez, I wasn't aware of any Quiznos promotion with GW2.
---
Thank you all for the detailed responses! I didn’t even consider core ranger as viable in pvp, I was perhaps going to suggest him to play core guard. 
---
As for going into ranked PvP I should clarify a few things. Due to hearing about the low PvP population in recent years, combined with me not queuing for unranked in many years, I was worried that unranked queues would take forever to fill thus making it overall difficult to find good matches. I did get a chance to test it out yesterday and to my surprise found out that people still do play unranked, so we will definitely practice there.  My friend is also a sole PvPer for MMOs and plays various MOBAs so he probably will pick up things very fast. As mentioned before I was testing unranked yesterday and in terms of build comps and rotating around the map, things were a mess. I feel like the only way to learn that type of stuff is through ranked. Anyhow thanks for all of you guys responses!
---
Off. I never liked the green and red auras when you target or mouse over allies and enemies respectively, and there another way to turn this off.
---
So it's a Springer?
---
Boonthief doing about as much damage as some pugs, this is some happy stuff.
---
Really nice to see these records. \o/
---
Except he said he was in orientation for a store manager position, which means it's a corporate training or done at a pseudo-district level.
---
Ty very much
---
Got them too. My internet never lagging so it had to be Gw2.
---
Quiznos only operates on a franchise basis, which means it is 100% NOT corporate owned.  It IS corporate supervised in the sense that they will have regular monthly to quarterly inspections to make sure they aren't doing exactly these things, but a franchise can literally be as small as one store owned by one person who has paid for the rights to sell subs to Quiznos standards using the Quiznos name.  Subway, by the way, operates on a very similar 100% franchise model.  I have worked as a unit manager of both.  The particular Quiznos in this area was franchised to someone who only had one other store, about two hours south.
---
The one I was at wasn't profitable largely due to the 9 Subways in town and abundance of other local sub shops that were more popular.  It was shut down and as far as I know the franchisee now only has his one in the other town (which is also the closest Quiznos to me according to google maps).  Which would be why I then got a job with the local Subway franchise. 
---
 Franchises do not operate on corporate/regional/district models at all.  So no, that is incorrect.  They were being trained by the franchise owner or by someone the franchise owner had hired as their overall franchise manager (which franchises that are large enough will have.  The Fara/Firoose franchise at Subway constitutes 34 stores across three states and had three franchise managers working for them at each major location they operated from)
---
What is your point with your replies to me?
---
I mean if you want lots of movement/mobility while fighting basically nothing beats staff daredevil on thief.
---
2 of the 5 weapon skills include movement, and your dodge can be an attack, and you have 3 of them.
---
Pair that with some thief utility skills and you'll be zig-zagging and vaulting through the air all over the place while fighting stuff.
---
That's very true, which I said in my post.  Franchises that do that don't last long, and never going to ANY Quiznos ever again because of it is an overreaction.  This was likely (if true at all, which it may be or may not) the result of an individual franchise owner who was having trouble making ends meet with his stores, and was trying to save money in any way possible by "keeping food cost percentage down."  The fact is, though, that customers will notice that the quality of a store is poor, it's not as sneaky as the franchise owner thinks it is, and their business will only continue to decline.  I guarantee that this was not the only thing wrong with the store he allegedly applied to (cleanliness, training level of employees, etc).  There's never just one thing.
---
Keep in mind most attacks let you move while performing them (for example all of warrior's axe attacks allow for full movement).
---
Some classes do however have more mobility than others.
---
Mesmers feature mediocre out of combat mobility, but as soon as there are targets to deal with they're actually extremely mobile and/or evasive, this is reinforced by traits that benefit dodges too.
---
Thieves focus on evasion and are given a great amount of teleports and evades, however (unlike the mesmer) while evades are plentiful they're used up more sparingly in combat (due to either initiative cost or higher cooldown).
---
Rangers are third when it comes to combat mobility (look for example at sword/dagger) and can kite.
---
All other classes feature some mobility options, some can be more obvious (like the engineer who has some very powerful mobility options) while some can be more subtle (like melee elementalists having a ton of small dashes).
---
If you really like mobility, mesmer, ranger and thief should suit you well enough. You may prefer the first 2 early on, before getting used to the thief playstyle. :)
---
It's not the point here. But thanks for sharing your 2 cents. (-:

wow even the warrior did 23k...must check out his rotation.
---
I like it but out of all the events in the game this one just brings my pc to a crawl. I don't know if it's the mounts or a combo of all the branded effects but by the time we are on the final boss im getting 5fps. for real.
---
common sense on reddit lmao
---
Neither, it seems, was Quiznos.
