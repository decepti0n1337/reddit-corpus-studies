I guess maybe they ran out of keys set aside to sell on sale?

When I posted this link it still showed 8 days left. I guess it got swamped.

They aren't mutually exclusive. They can have both. Both help the game. The stream brought attention to the game and got free coverage during a big gaming news weekend. A trailer wouldn't have done that. It got some of the highest views the game has gotten on Twitch, a trailer wouldn't have done that. They capitalized on a large audience of GW2 fans and got them to see merchandise many of them will now buy, making money for the game without gambling, without taking rewards from raids, without using up any developer resources.
---
You can compare the stream with the digital magazine, but I don't see logical arguments for why the stream announcement was bad. They rented a theater during a convention weekend in the city they are based in and sent out a press release which got them a tonne of exposure that would have cost a lot of money to equal with advertising. That's a big win for the game. People who weren't looking at GW2 are suddenly looking at it, yesterday you could buy the the complete GW2 collection for $15 from an official retailer, right on the heels of big exposure for the game.
---
Compare them all you want, but I'm not seeing the logically consistent arguments for why the announcement was bad, or that it should be mutually exclusive with a magazine that almost no-one who's not already paying attention to GW2 would read.

I show a lot of new people around, mostly because I find it fun. If you're on a US server, I can help you out in game, give you a bit of a tour. If you're free to play I'd have to friend you first, so I'd need your name, but if you've paid for the game feel free to add me Vayne.8563.
---
I think that's just your own opinion and you may have reasons to think so. I like the new food, the idea of gathering seeds, planting and harvesting your own ingredients instead of "just craft/buy" them and the way to make a bit gold with it is nice too. 
---
I don't want to convince you, so I don't want to try it. I accept your opinion and I can understand your point that they could have made more out of cooking. They could, but I personally are happy with what we got.

Or being a speaking bear.

Good riddance to bad trash.

Always funny to see people "discovering" Rata Sum's jail. :D

Wasn't aware of this. Just backed. This will look nice alongside my GW Art book, GW2 hard cover strategy guide, and eventually 20th Anniversary art book.

Oh I didn't see it, ordered mine. Thanks :)

Recently came back to the game about a week ago and I'm trying to just get HoT content finished up before I do anything PoF related(though I might try to get my mount before Saturday). I joined up with an HP/Mastery train yesterday but I do want to 100% everything so I hope I can squeeze into your train! Doing the train yesterday reminded me that tipping exists. If I do manage to take part, do you take tips? If so, what are the usual kinds of tips that you expect? I usually do some amount of gold but I'm never sure what's proper.
---
:D
---
If they already stated all the dragons are androgynous then why are they even bringing gender into this at all?
---
If you complete the sylvari one, you get a lot to grow stuff in your home instance too. for free. (the other 2 lots are gems only)
---
The story chapters merge eventually! A little bit after claw island I think as you head into Orr all of the stories blend together. 
---
After you kill Zhaitan, all story missions going forward will be much easier to complete in a group!
---
Wow. I want that one in rl.
---
How long do we have to do this?
---
Not to mention it was hard to read, hard to navigate, and had shit performance.
---
Games pretty chill you really can't go wrong just go out and do stuff that looks interesting, use what feels good. Searching builds will bring up meta builds super easy to follow.
---
By level cap you'll know what to do.
---
yes you told me in guild chat
---
They are super cheap now. Just get another one
---
Note that character names are unique, but account names are not unique (but are made unique by the addition of the 4 digits at the end.) You can whisper someone by character name without fault, but if you use account names without the .### at the end you will not necessarily get who you intended to get.
---
Dungeon story paths do not happen after personal story, they happen during it.
---
At certain points in the story you will get a mail from your Destiny's Edge friend of your character's race talking about how Destiny's Edge are doing.
---
For example, Ascalon Catacombs happens after Setting the Stage.
---
These mails are separate from the mails you get from your Herald, those are received when leveling up.   
---
I was not able to find them documented anywhere in the wiki, tho.
---
Are you saying sword is almost the same damage output as greatsword?

You know, they should start making in-game announcements when they do changes like this
---
Lol! I'd already seen it from the outside but I didn't know there was a VIP tour :P
---
Fantastic style! That's one of the fiercer Skyscales I've seen in a piece of art. :D
---
Perfect title for season 3. They threw too much ideas into that season, it feels like a tango
---
That makes sense! Though is it dumb? Or just secretly genius to scale cliff sides with no equipment??? ü§îü§î
---
:T FFS ANet.
---
That'd be why they so conveniently introduced 5 seed packs instead of a nice round 4 that would fit into the one garden plot you get through the collection.
---
Woo this place is FUCKED.
---
and this one sucks. taking so much longer to harvest my usual places.
---
Wow. Very good.
---
the benefit of scepter focus over sword focus is the range that scepter gives you; otherwise; Sword's pretty much on par damage wise.
---
Yeah this!  I want them to apply this exact thing to personal NPCs so even if people drop them on top of chests or w/e to troll.. you don't have to ever worry about them being in the way as the owner is the only one that can interact with it.
---
Yeah, sword can be swapped in on most power builds.  With a good rotation, it can replace GS without too much dps loss (assuming you have another source of retal), but I prefer to swap out scepter when I don't need range.  In both cases use focus as your offhand.
---
Unlike what another poster said, Race does not matter after you‚Äôre out of the intro. You can easily get to other player‚Äôs starting zones and even do your ‚Äúrace specific‚Äù story missions together, even though they won‚Äôt get xp or mission advancement until you guys end up on the same story step. 
---
Might want to look up a story flow chart to figure out where the story steps you CAN agent credit together on start if you guys are going to play the story together 
---
You guys can pick the same classes too if you want; each class has different elite specs and multiple ways to play so you‚Äôre not really penalized for choosing all the same class
---
I‚Äôm not satisfied with that. Not one bit. Smells to me like a cheap way out. And what do they bleed, sap? Unnatural to say the least.
---
They do bleed sap.
---
What's sad is this post tbh.  It adds literally nothing of substance to this sub.
---
It makes sense, but wouldn‚Äôt everything just be sticky after killing one?
---
Correct.
---
&gt;Did you read what you wrote? You said that Jormag is persuading people to join the elder dragons, not persuading people to join Jormag alone.
---
Exactly. What part aren't you getting?
---
&gt; Again, people who work with each other rub off on each other. 
---
Do tell me when was it even suggested Taimi cared about their gender.
---
&gt; Who's obsessed? 
---
You apparently since you're making excuses for it all and even saying that it was likely Taimi rubbing off on him.
---
Not really an easy ask when the game doesn't have the ability to swap between builds.
---
I would love to go back but only if Anet undos the travesty that is the current EotN. That tower was apparently standing from time immemorial, crafted by some unknown race in GW1 but just a short 250 years later its in ruins??? Or at least give us an explanation as to why its destroyed. I guess they could just slap the ol' 'Jormag did it!' and call it a day.
---
I was at first thinking visiting the EotN wouldn't happen because the instant already exists for GW1 acheievement skins, but I guess they could just make a separate story mode instance. But I thought the tone was that everyone was sick of GW1 locations! hehe
---
I'd like some tousled hair styles. I swing a big hammer all day. It only makes sense my hair would be a sexy mess. 
---
Also, more shoulder length hair for male norn or humans would be nice.
---
Are they worth buying if I already have 3 infinite tools? They all had nice effects but not unbound magic...
---
I use them in shared slots and have easy access from all toons, not sure if I want one more set. 
---
But Magic sounds good
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/gathering/permanent-nodes
---
I agree, I want more simplified appearances too. The same applies to skins and outfits too, I want things that look more casual/comfortable instead of excessively bulky/spiky or flambuoyant crap. Aetherblade leggins have been the only genuinely good heavy leg options for so many years.
---
I've max leveled every craft but jewelry and food I believe. Is it worth it to go from 0 to 400 for most people?
---
&gt;The fact that you need the serial code is really obnoxious
---
Why?
---
It's to confirm your identity. Sure there are other ways at going about that but I don't think there's more concrete methods since the code is emailed to you and the only way you lose it is if someone hacks you (rare but plausible) or you change your email (definitely plausible). You can remedy the latter by having backups of important documents.
---
Seems fine to me ¬†¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
I came here to post this myself as I just experienced this for myself. A friend and I often harvest each others home instances and we did theirs first (one garden node from the gem store) I harvested everything and was looking forward to seeing the results of the seeds I planted yesterday (just finished the collection) and everything was empty. 
---
I was under the impression that the garden nodes you got from the collection were different than the ones from the gem store since only the instance owner can harvest them, or maybe that is the cultivated plants not the nodes. In any case I think its kinda messed up that a gem store node and the collection node share the same cooldown since they are functionally different(afaik) to a player that only has the collection one ie they can only plant the seeds for 500cooking and there is no auto replanting.
---
This is very very cool !
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You'll probably have some luck around here when you open up commissions :)
---
&gt; also grab guild-hall crafting buff from tavern vendor
---
Ah, Nathan my buddy.
---
Well see when someone asks you a question you generally give them an answer if you can.
---
Yea you tend to die when you are killed
---
That is for NCSoft as a whole though, which has a different cost structure than A.Net.  For instance a bulk of their variable costs are distribution costs for all of their mobile games, as Apple/Google take a sizable chunk of all sales; relevant for Lineage and their other mobile titles, not relevant to A.Net.
---
I had the PoF from Nuuvem in my cart but just didn't checkout. Feelsbadman.
---
Waiting until it goes on sale again.
---
True dat.
---
Its about 7-8% lower actually and has allot less cleave but more mobility.
---
If they would just take the block of #3, lower the CD to 12 seconds base and make it usable while moving then tack on something offensive it would be amazing.
---
I never thought I'd see the day where Dekaron content was suggested for GW2 lol.......
---
Every day stuff:
---
-Septuple Gemstone farm (12g ; 1.5 hours)
---
Junundu -&gt; doppel -&gt; forged with fire -&gt; VB -&gt; Pinata -&gt; TD-&gt; AB
---
- dailies (2g, 10 AP ; 10 Minutes)
---
- t4 fractals (20g ; 30-45 minutes), CMs
---
- gather guildhalls (3g ; 5 minutes)
---
- gather homeinstance ( ~5g)
---
- craft daily ascended timegates (x ; 2 minutes at max, no cooking stuff for me)
---
That's 301g per week if done daily
---
Weekly stuff:
---
- keyfarm (x ; 15 minutes)
---
- raid full clear (70g; 400 minutes)
---
- 1 dungeon run (8 paths, 5g ; 90-120 minutes)
---
376g per week
---
Whereas I agree with you, you aren't helping by verbally demoralizing someone.
---
After skimming through Caudecus' room, I wouldn't doubt if this was his lost manuscript.
---
One of the guild wars books describes sylvari blood as "a golden fluid that sparkled with life," so perhaps not quite sap. Sounds more like ichor, as in Greek myth.
---
Believe what you want mamas boy. Keep being the miserable loser. Complain about the game you love if that‚Äôs what gets you off.
---
Good advice! I should note for 3, you don't even need to go through cities to meet up, simply finishing the tutorial area adds all racial starting waypoints (Soren Draa, Astorea, Shaemoor, Smokestead and Horncall) and there's basically no cost to waypoint at that level.
---
Thanks, this was always something that I was going to get around to doing, but I'll make it a priority instead.
---
I think every class can 1v1 in spvp if you‚Äôre good enough. I‚Äôve got a cancer condi mirage build that will win most 1v2, and it‚Äôs so annoying to fight that the enemy can‚Äôt do too much about it. Otherwise I almost always fight on soulbeast
---
There‚Äôs no more CMs in stories because people complain a lot whenever they add ‚Äústronger‚Äù normal mode bosses, for example fight against Caudecus in LS3, which I found pretty interesting and fun to figure out mechanics of, was nerfed thanks to large number of complaints on the forums.  
---
It‚Äôs sad because most of those people‚Äôs issues would be solved if they just bothered to take some CC skills and to look up a semi-decent build instead of mixing random stats, weapons and traits that don‚Äôt go well together.
---
By forever, you mean until you have cooking I guess? If I unlearn it to use my old crafting discipline will bonuses disappear?
---
This system is a complete mess.
---
The warclaw is very easy to get, you don‚Äôt need to follow a Zerg, look at the map and see which objectives need to be defended or attacked. Usually roamers will say if the objective they are attacking has its walls down or if an objective needs defending. Either way you just need to get to +195 then just tag people in ebg when two clouds of players meet. And do your dailies ofc
---
Given how slow the projectile move from the #3 even if you were moving if the target is as well a decent number of them would miss.
---
Having them count as 2 hits for the sake of justice would mean that even if all of them landed you would only apply justice 3 times, something the auto attack can do rather quickly anyway.
---
Conversely having each hit apply a short duration bleed would be a decent dps boost if fully buffed and they all hit.
---
yeah, probably.  Luckily, since it's a gemstore item, they'll probably fix it fast
---
  [Varietal Seeds](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Varietal_Peppercorn_Seed)  from wvw synthesizers ?
---
Pfft bahahahahahaha why would they spend time training you if you‚Äôre not gonna be raiding with them that often? If you‚Äôre not serious about getting better at raids, you will be a detriment to your team, and that is how squads get wiped.
---
That‚Äôs just 1 guild....
---
What are you on about? If you‚Äôre talking about Mesmer clones then the balance update affected the change and not the expansion release.
---
I really really really really really hope it gets added to hair kits.
---
The 4 installation disks kinda killed me.
---
Well... they‚Äôre not real
---
What content? LW crap?
---
In that case, I'll guess I'll go with space, and hopefully the game has auto-completion tab feature when whispering people :)
---
Thanks!
---
They get single player missions in an mmo and these plebs think it‚Äôs content....
---
You need this https://aka.ms/vs/15/release/vc_redist.x64.exe
---
Do you want to be able to craft ascended items at some point? Then you'll want 500. If you really don't care, since ascended gear really only matters if you're trying to min/max or in T4 fractals, then feel free to not do it. I would suggest getting to 500 cooking (or at least doing parts of the collection) so that you unlock Varietal seeds and Quality Red Meat drops on all characters.
---
This art style hits me right in the g-spot. Really nice drawing!
---
Eu server with most skill is not WSR. They are a bandwagon server, they outnumber you on every match and will always win because of that. It‚Äôs the worst server to play against because you will rarely get a fair fight, that said even when they do outnumber you, they still lose fights. Then they just result to building tonnes of siege and camping inside their tower. They have also crap roamers cuz they‚Äôll only take 1vX fights.
---
I‚Äôm glad someone stated proper servers and not bandwagon servers like WSR
---
not enough answers.
---
Yeah, maybe youre right.
---
Before i made up "tiers" based on every 10 lvls or so.
---
So i would use racial skills till 11, then remove one, and add an elite racial skill at 21, then remove one and use a different racial elite skill at 31 etc.
---
There was a challenge of me lvling a norn guardian, only in shiverpeaks, and the goal was to smash claw of jormag with 0deaths.
---
At around lvl 25 i was starting to be under leveled vs mobs around me, so it made me turn my whole build into a more defensive/ healing build and it was great.
---
Balthazar steals and wields Sohothin, 10 man raid lets go.
---
Perhaps i will try one on a new f2p acc?
---
But a lot of people have expressed that they don't want to bother with it, since you have to replant every day.
---
We don‚Äôt want to draw in pve players, we want Anet to fix the damn game mode. Pve players do not get on discord and they don‚Äôt help us win fights. You guys can stay on your pve maps tagging random bosses for 8 hours straight.
---
Do you have any add-ons installed?
---
Yup. I know.
---
I mentioned it before in a reply, my charr blood legion did ac after setting the stage step.
---
And cof was after claw island when traherne "started" to form the pact.
---
No its its own contained game mode
---
So what, you have no goals?
---
Fractals 100 with cm?
---
Full ascended?
---
Guild hall decoration?
---
Raids?
---
WvW?
---
Legendary items?
---
If this is not for you, then sadly there is no Mmo for you.
---
This question have been asked 1361819 times already...

HoT is given automatically by Anet for every PoF owner amen.

Hey buddy :D

Just so you know, this little interaction was a really nice end to my day yesterday. Thanks man.
---
That isn't even close to what I said.

You'd get a lot further in your discussions with people if you didn't twist what they say and build baseless straw arguments constantly.
---
Holla Holla more than five dolla?
---
I know you may find this hard to believe, but some people choose their class for raids because they like that class and have fun playing it. I know, crazy.
---
I have this mount wheel panel thingy if that counts
---
No harmn in it indeed. Couple of things you can do to test things out before consuming the level 80 boost after you completed the intro instance:
---
* Go in the PvP lobby and test out all the weapons/traits/elite specs that you want on the test golems/NPCs with no pressure even on a level 2 character. That way you can get a feel of the elite specs you may like/prefer.
---
* When you select the level 80 boost you will get ported to The Silverwastes as a Trial for the level 80 boost. In there you will not have access to any Elite Specs but you will get a fully grown level 80 character with Exotic gear to test out in "real" conditions. Unfortunately the gear they give can be a bit crappy sometimes: a lot of classes get Soldier gear which is not great if you wanna see big red number :p. But apart from that it can be a good thing to try out on top of the PvP lobby.
---
O. o I thought this was an interesting lore question before , but calling a type of fantasy humanoid plant creature "unnatural" because it has wooden bones and bleeds sap is a weird flex.
---
Id say swords are ment to be used with virtue of justice.
---
Plenty of rapid cleaving hits that will trigger it.
---
Trait it it via virtue line to become aoe and requires less hits, also increase its crit rate and the trait that refreshes voj , youre looking at a melee hybrid that burns and blinds everything around him with frequent crits and pumps loads of might around.
---
The more mobs the better
---
I played my first two hours yesterday, and I'm confused by the questioning mechanism. I'm a big fan of games lore, and I enjoy exploring quests talk with people, but I find two quite hard on Guild Wars 2. First of all, quests. I often reached a new ' Zone' where quest is active, where the goal is already 80% finished, or even more. by the way I reached to NPC with the arrow above to head to understand why am I exactly killing stuff - the quest bar was already full and she was thanking me. Similar happened with "Event near you" messages. I got to the event area, I killed something half way, I got a reward - not sure what just happened. Is that's the way it suppose to work?
---
The other thing - talking with NPC to learn about the world. It was hard to identify which NPCs has something to say. I had to "hover" above each NPC I find along the way, if It had the right icon - I would check what it has to say, but this game of hovering over every npc in the area just to figure out if it has some information got tiring after some time.
---
Is there any way to solve the above issues? game options? addons?
---
You can earn good money via pvp, there areare some unique pvp only weapon and armor skins.
---
The reward tracks offer pvpers to gain rewards from pve zones and dungeons, even the newer ones. 
---
Tho, on a rotation, if you wish to pick and chose which track you wanna progress youll have to dip your toes into pve.
---
Otherwise, youre good to go. You wont be weaker than a pve player as pvp is based on pvp amulets for stats, and your pve gear doesnt matrer at all
---
Yup. As long as you don't go past fractal 19, you don't need any special equipment or anything. Beyond that, you need to start thinking about Agony Resistance, ascended gear and infusions, which will start to drop in time. Good luck!
---
Weird flex but ok
---
Wow, that's so good just after the one year! Keep it up :&gt;
---
It still makes sense to try and play them all so you see and learn the mechanics.
---
For general pve i have loads of fun playing a diviner/commander firebrand.
---
Having 100% boon duration, with power prec ferocity stats lets me spam save your selves and feel my wrath, as well as mantra heal in order to get almost all permanent boon uptime including 25might, quickness, fury, regen, protection and others.
---
so you dont drop those seeds and meat if you dont have cooking with your current character, even if you have 500 with another one?
---
Have an apple, Tybalt
---
Best solution is to grab some friends to do the fractal progression with
---
You do not have to do them in sequential order.
---
What you can do is do whatever is daily, as long as your AR is high enough; everything up to 20 should be safe. Your personal fractal level does not matter when you join groups. Even if you couldn't select a high level yourself, if someone else does, you can play it. Each time you finish a level higher or equal to your current level, your level increases by 1.
---
Having said that: it does pay to pay a little attention as to which fractals you already have played, even besides your fractal level, because of this achievement: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chest_of_the_Casual_Fractal_Hero .
---
I play ele, guardian, rev. I got others that i used to play with.
---
But i could never play mesmer or engineer. It just doesnt suit me.
---
Rangers are nice, necros are easy, thieves are great challenge and change cause squishy and initiative system but i prefer more versatile professions like the first 3 i mentioned
---
Wow, that is pretty! Thanks for sharing. Im so going to get this.
---
Maybe do my daily, then log out
---
I LOVE cooking. Not sure how to make it profitable, but dang am I enjoying this update!
---
Maybe for sPVP, but not any pve builds
---
btw you should frist focus on getting ascended trinkets tehy are easy to get via LS maps and can be upgraded for more slots, after this weapon and chest since those have the most stats over exo
---
I think a bleed wouldn't fit a core weapon too much, but a Justice bonus would be great.
---
Legit thanks for the explaination. Definitely gonna work on it now since i've been doing lot of map exploration while waiting for pvp queue.
---
do they completely disappear or just become ungrown?
---
I think so as well but the flexibility it adds to gameplay is hard to give up.
---
LS1- thanks for the memories
---
  
---
LS2- i hate sand, it gets everywhere
---
LS3- ASCENDED GEAR!1!1!1

LS4- no reason to return? Here's a collection that requires s**tload of currencies from these maps.
---
log in
---
go to nearest crafting station

craft 1 glob of elder spirit reside, lump of mithrillium, spool of thick elonian cord, spool of silk weaving thread

log off

Sorry I've been away from GW2. You said that every player should do it before the patch. Why is that? Is something going away after?
---
exactly... at least that's the way I'm going to take it for now (until there's further/ other explanation)
---
And with this "conflagration" fits too. His "corruption" (=destroyers) spread like wildfire, destroying (coincidence? :D) everything in their paths.
---
Please don't write a new article here each time you add someone. ANet isn't going to read this here, and we aren't interested.
---
When the Storylines converge and you choose different paths - because you want to experience different things - overwirting can happen
---
A few friends and I played new characters through the storyline and the mission of the storystarter overwrote a different one from one of my friends, moving him to a different order.
---
Food is a bit of an anomaly compared to other items, it‚Äôs free sources are wvw and festivals otherwise you get it from crafting, then when it comes to crafting many of the ingredients required are vendor items which can help keep prices pretty stable. A cup of light roasted coffee which which was the example rudeasura gave for the exotic part of the compost has a max cost, since all the items are bought from a vendor and there are several foods like this or mostly use vendor ingredients. If there is a food in each rarity that has a maximum cost the compost prices won‚Äôt go above that and as a whole the other prices will only go up to the prices of the food which have a capped price.
---
Maybe he just pressed r?
---
Don't worry, soon LS5 starts and you'll be able to invite up to nine of them to strike missions!
---
The main disadvantage is that they play a mode that's still supported.

Thank you ! ;w;

&gt; EDIT: so apparently it had nothing to do with the Display Name but the fact that there's a period in my email address.

Isn't there a dot in all email addresses?

If you only have 1 plot then you can harvest another person's plot 2 &amp; 3 without effecting your plot. If you have 2 plots then you can harvest their plot 3
---
Honestly just continue making new fractals. They have completely abandoned dungeons because no one knows how to code dungeons anymore. So fractals are their replacement. We desperately need another CM for fractals though.
---
&gt; A ton of the PoIs, Vistas, etc. are locked behind these vine walls
---
IIRC only one of them is locked behind event (near south lane) while the rest just require certain masteries like gliding or so.
---
&gt; And on top of it all, masteries seem like an absolute chore to grind to the point where I'll be doing these same events for weeks.
---
Something like that. Map meta events in AB and DS offer huge amounts of xp so with xp boosters, leveling masteries becomes very easy.
---
Masteries like advanced gliding and jumping mushrooms are almost mandatory for exploration. The rest are mostly used for some additional effects, collections and a couple of areas on each HoT map (like poison mastery).
---
They have the ability to reshape their face, and hair. And armor, which grows from their bodies as well (if using cultural of course). But entire limbs.. I'm not sure. I don't think so, as it has never been mentioned to my knowledge.
---
IS THAT EVEN LEGAL ?
---
If you like the mounts you can try and get the Beetle, Griffon and Skyscale (Dragon) from the living story and the Jackal from PoF in general.
---
The Skyscale will take some time and money but is pretty cool in my opinion and it was nice as a goal for me. :)
---
Haha, yes, well that‚Äôs a different situation of course.
---
The official gw2 wiki has a ton of information.
---
Regarding builds and such, you cant make a mistake as you unlock automatically all traits and skills at lvl 80.
---
Regarding specific team comps and raid rotations perhaps metabattle, youtube, and one or two other web pages that will show you how to play your class, build, at specific encounters.
---
Dungeons and fractals are easy so do whatever you feel fun with.
---
Generaly speaking, full berserker stat sets does nicely for all professions at lvl 80 (glass cannon dps.stat sets)
---
You should try mastering all the ls4 maps before attempting the Skyscale.
---
We have an ls4 meta train at 10:30am pst and 6:30pm for those interested. They run for 3-4hrs, but you can join/drop at your leisure.
---
We'd rather they *explained*.
---
When you call your spouse to tell her you'll be late home, tell her why and what held you at the office.
---
I think he means everyone who got 400 cooking before Ascended/500 cooking was patched in.  
---
Since I guess it's more expensive to go from 1-400 now.
---
Snap ty so much i love passive additions like this imma finish off the chef now gave up ages ago had no idea that was a thing
---
It wasn't a fun way of releiving you of 150-200 gold though.
---
well it should be and I have accs with a dot and had never any problems
---
check the password, you maybe typing it in a way that does not comply with some rules.
---
Future patch notes: "Removed bank tab from home instance cooking station"
---
Same rules apply to all 3rd party additions: Use at your own risk.
---
No-one has been banned yet for using the dx12 mod.
---
...Onto Deimos?
---
xD
---
Pvpers do not want pve  pvers do not want PvP
---
Where do I get the glyph though? I can't find anything by googleling..
---
Personally I think those that have wings look stupid. It's the dumbest skinning issue as they can not be used to actually fly with.
---
Partly. Its partly supported.
---
I did not just come out of the woodwork, I posted 4 videos every single week right until the skyscale collection. I got burnt out, it‚Äôs okay to take a semi break until new content and even then I still occasionally posted and streamed and working on a new video as we speak.
---
I don‚Äôt only come around for new content just for the money. I only got monetized with youtube a month after my skyscale collections. I have done this for years  (on/off) with no payment because I love the game.
---
Even then, I 100% understand why people take breaks between seasons. It can be a lot of work to produce a lot of content at once and it‚Äôs healthy to step away for a break. It doesn‚Äôt mean they are only here for the money, they mentally may just need to play other games. 
---
You actually seemed nice to me in the comments below, then I seen you added your woodwork comment. So which is it, you don‚Äôt mean to attack or do you?
---
I've got this bug, where on my 41lvl Guardian I cannot access Black Lion Store, while on my 35lvl Necro-soon-to-be-Scourge I can with no problem, same with other alts.
---
Like, my guardian is the only one character I cannot use BL with.
---
Welp... time to turn my Guild Wars into Cooking War 2 aka, shokugeki no souma 2
---
99cm is easier than raids.
---
No I do not want . That why they can do T1
---
T1 and training run are not the same 
---
Moreover they slit fractals in more shorter one cause they were too long . 
---
That's the whole point raids need to be scalable. You want hard mode do your T4 raid and let noobs do their T1 with same reward currency but lesser quantity 
---
This is the only way to move ppl to raid otherwise the situation will be the same.
---
This is what strikes are
---
That's not even what I'm talking about, I really dislike how gw2 salvages content with every new collection. Kill Boss X, Y, Z and press F on A, B, C. I have done all of it countless times and I don't enjoy it anymore. I'd rather either have a challenge or something new to do.
---
Not sure about this. Take a look at dragonfall without mounts you cannot reach some points . The hot utilities in that map were not mandatory cause not everyone has them now they could add a leylone gliding like a skyscale high jump since u should have unlocked both
---
I actually played Path of Exile 2 years ago, finished the story campaign. Pretty cool game, if only I was into dungeon crawling type games :D
---
Warframe was something I always wanted to try, and maybe I will this year once I finish some single player games I have here.
---
Neither do i and that was not the point. Those times are gone the messers are not there anymore because it only happen when were were many that wanted it, so you will have to jump it two times to get the legendary trinket. It was more of a joke post but i guess we just drop it here :)
---
"I'm in maintenance mode"
---
Perfect description of my playtime in GW2 at the moment.
---
Im pretty sure the reason expansions sell is due to the new content for new and continuing players in this case there really isnt much besides living story. This entire event could have been a dev video on youtube only difference being that you dont rent out a theater at pax to talk about your story and lore for 25 mins and end everything with leggins and funko pops for your grand finale.   I dont understand why you think all of this would be good for something like pax, if i was looking at this for the first time i would stay away. Both expansions being cheaper doesnt mean much in the grand scheme of things because its really just a way to get more people into cash shop mounts and loot boxes.
---
The portable one do not close either. The ecto one i run with constantly open when running between spots in WvW and get me in to trouble :D
---
And if they close you instant reopen it as many times you like there are no cooldowns.
---
unpopular opinion: "daily rewards" are pretty bad for game health. in this game there is a very emphasis on forcing u to spread ur playtime over the week, which is quite disrespectful of a player's time who wants to play only in the weekend. concepts like daily login rewards and daily completionist also force u to do those since they offer a pretty huge reward, and u can't go for a collection achi u like, or daily fractals or w/e if u can only play for 30min a day.
---
basically everyday u have to take advantage of the daily rewards THEN do what u may like to do in the game.
---
&gt; why don't you want it so much?
---
Its value to me is equivalent to a magazine, while the price is an order of magnitude higher. It's an item intended to be owned, not consumed, and I don't need more items like that sitting around collecting dust.
---
At the same time, I understand that it's very exciting for the artists who are featured in it and for the type of person who will enjoy owning it, so I'm glad the campaign was so successful.
---
- Dailies every day, at least 3/3
---
- W6 and W7 every week (other wing bosses reached 250kp, which is my goal)
---
- Random WvW
---
Total gameplay time varies from 30 min to 3 hours per day.
---
yes, I found that as well but do I really need to buy three of the "Skyscale Hatchling Harvesting tool" ,  remove the glyphs to equip it in like my pickaxe and axe? That can't be the solution o:
---
Can you send them in an ingame mail?
---
This is the only way for now yes.
---
I dislike that they have no in-universe justification for existing. Like, what, do people in Tyria walk around with fake wings because they think it looks cool? Wings in GW2 feel very much like a case of putting the gem store before the integrity of the setting.
---
The weapons are also in the wrong hands. Axe should be in the right hand.
---
Okay thank you!
---
Spearmarshal's Jerkin :D
---
Keep me posted!!! I love your art style and have been wanting some stuff done of my Charrs for a while.
---
Assuming you are playing core only, can't go wrong with warrior, guardian and thief.
---
Warrior buffs you and your team with banners, guardian can save you all from a big attack with aegis, plus you can channel might for your team with staff, and thief can blind enemies and make you all 3 invisible in case you guys wanna retreat or sneak past done hard enemies.
---
It came bundled with the Skyscale harvesting tool but is also an extremely rare drop from Black Lion chests.  You can get harvesting tools for Karma with the reaping ability though from special gathering vendors in certain areas.  The one I know off the top of my head is in the Lily of the Elon near the crafting stations
---
Do I have to unlock the whole line or is it okay to unlock till Varietal Herbs in Sylvari line? Do I have to craft Portable Composter and so on?
---
The skills being completely different didn't trigger any suspicions?
---
And I agree with op
---
That‚Äôs very reasonable and understandable (:
---
I don't get why they excluded Tyria. I have alt accounts who want that autoloot and i am sure new players want that asap as well. And gaining more xp for new players leveling is not really bad either.
---
no, cant reply or return to sender

Flax farming has become a third world problem now.  Please fix **ASAP!**  I can't deal.
---
Stopping to buy them is what makes them expensive for gold in the first place, as they become more scarce.
---
I like people spreading positivity and actually doing stuff for the community instead of...
---
...whining about stuff.
---
...threatening to quit due to stuff.
---
...quitting and writing a large post why they quit.
---
...lurking around the forums for months/years complaining about how the game wronged them and why they are so happy having quit telling everyone the game/game mode is dead.
---
...complaining about no new content and playing WoW classic. &lt;- get it? ;)
---
So even though I don't raid I am wishing you a lot of success with your project. It's guys like you making a game more enjoyable for everyone.
---
It's a fair observation to make. Until we get another Primordus-focused story to see more variations of destroyers, we won't know for sure if he'd just rather kill the inhabitants of Tyria rather than corrupt them to make more minions. 
---
Prior observed information shows that it'd rather build minion constructs, but some minions (like the Destroyer Queen) have shown the ability to lay eggs to create more destroyers, which seems like a troublesome way to create more destroyers unless it was a living creature that was corrupted and retained that instinct/function to lay eggs to hatch newborns.
---
&gt; So what I get from this is Primordus is Fire and War.
---
Essentially, which is somewhat expected given the context of fire and war in this game and in other media. Conflagration was a clever choice though, since the main definition people think of is the context of an actual fire; I think Anet wanted to continue the war theme without making Primordus seem like a dragon version of Balthazar at a glance. How this will influence it's behavior remains to be seen; it's hard to see Primordus' activity when most of its time is spent underground.
---
So more people play the expansion content.
---
[Hm. Guess she'll have to contact them.](https://www.twitch.tv/birdofchess)
---
But is this the intent of Strike Missions?  A gateway to raiding?  Was that something one of the devs said during the presentation or afterwards?  If so I missed it.
---
I'm looking at it as more content.  Good content? We'll see.
---
Maybe the will encourage more people to try out raids, maybe they won‚Äôt. Just wait and you will see if they do.
---
Welp, my bad, I read it as sarcastic. I thought you meant as a content creator I crawled out of the woodwork as I *would* be posting more for the next season. Your summary had that some of us only post during season releases for money and I thought that is what you were labelling me.
---
Ignore me üò∂üôÉ (I think I am playing too much GTA and got feisty).

that's the link the website gives me.
---
They literally said it was introductory raid content and a stepping stone to raids.
---
They literally called it introductory content to raids during that presentation.
---
Most people I know started off doing literal progression 1-by-1, how is this not an answer?
---

Core game itself does not really need an xp weekend, leveling is fast enough. And Probably in is HoT only because we will need HoT and Season 3 Masteries in Season 5.

---
When the game's life depends on whales.
---
Apparently I forgot about PvP. You can also do PvP instead, the gold rewards are better during seasons and you too get ascended gear and can unlock stuff. You get tomes there too!
---
&gt; This was done as a way of, you guess it, making casuals feel included in raid content. This won‚Äôt however make casuals want to raid, because raiding requires interactions with others on a personal level.‚Äù 
---
I've done easily over 300 raids, all pugs, and the only interactions with others I had (aside from challenge motes) was me pinging my LI and Legendary armor to get in, so not even on a personal level.  I don't think that part is credible,  and I think strike missions **could** be a gateway to raids **if** they're implemented well, not too easy, not too hard, boss phases etc. But we will have to wait and see, it actually could become as you say, a "glorified raid" to make casuals feel happy.
---
But if anet **does** implement it well, then it would mean that they just gave a lot of people tons of replayable content (aka the real raids). And that content was already there to begin with, so that would be a win for anet, aswell as for us.
---
*Why also for us?*  
---
Well, if more people get into raids, anets focus will shift aswell, over half of all the players **never touched a raid**. So it makes sense that they're making more casual stuff, because it's easy money and keeps the majority happy. If more people will raid, chances are Anet will revise their plan a bit and (hopefully) make raid releases on a good schedule. For it will be more lucrative for them to do so.
---
I do share your sentiment though, after being letdown so many times with raids and WVW, it's only natural to keep our hopes low.
---
***Real*** key runners uses *9* tomes of knowledge and use an armor and weapon set to blast thru the story quickly.
---
&gt;Casuals are the one paying the bills for them anyway,
---
[Citation needed] 
---
Even if so, "casuals" won't play the game on their own. Hardcore community is a definig force for the game, it shapes the game into form which "casuals" may only fill. Didn't last month teach you anything? When allegedly "small and insignificant" high end community of all gamemodes appeared to be impactful enough to give gw2 solid "dead game" public status.
---
Yeah, you don't sound entitled at all, you must be such a pleisure to have around, I don't see why they wouldn't go out of their way to make you good.
---
\&gt;statics are here to provide weekly smooth clears, it's just about the worst place to look for help as a new player
---
\&gt;litteral training guilds are a thing, you can find em by typing "raid training guild" on your damn browser
---
\&gt;You can form a group with your own standards but you didn't, because you're just looking to get carried until you're good, and with enough kp's that you can enter any group.
---
Except it's rarely bringing in 1-2 randoms, it's entire squads. I always see this "hur dur raiders are all elitist and preventing new players from joining", but new players never ask the questions to get in.
---
Nearly everytime I see a new player walk into the areodrome and ask questions about raids there are multiple people there to answer and help. Training discords are always looking for new people to train (albeit more and more vets are quitting). And hell SC's site has multiple build guides and links to training discords. This entire narrative of elitist raiders is driven by people who join high KP pugs with no experience and get kicked.
---
Which the already said about (now discontinued) fractal cms.
---
When you went to the elementary school, you were basically carried by teacher as well. That's just how the most effective share of knowledge works.
---
I don't think there is a fool that thinks about strike missions as gateway to something, both in development team and community. The sole purpose of this thing is to produce extremely dumbed down public group content (mom, I'm raiding!) for the bottom of the barrel players so they would never ever feel the urge (and discomfort) to improve themselves and get into real organized group pve.
---
I have to....
---
"Fractal time! Come on, grab your friends! We'll go to very distant lands. With CiupiKiller and his guild, the fun will never end, it's fractal tiiiiiiime\~"
---
interesting. So you never contacted support about them?
---
The one which they will announce sometime near the end of LS5. 
---
Being able to sell much requested stuff like Cantha is like a piggy bank waiting to be plundered.
---
Also giving HoT for free when you have PoF reminds me much of other MMOs like WoW which bring you up to current to be able to sell everyone the next expansion.
---
If people would just come into the game late and be told "oh, btw. you need to buy all X previous expansions to be able to enjoy the current one" I doubt there'd be many sales.
---
Thus I guess there'll be one after LS5. The devs did not say: "We'll never do an expansion!" but only that they didn't plan for one currently.
---
But until LS5 ends, there'll be enough time to set aside some people to create the content.
---
Why make so many assumptions before we have even seen it? Strike missions are trying to fulfill several things we have asked for... If they will achieve what they set out to do we can't really know now.
---
* they are supposed to tune story bosses for more people and make them repayable.  
---
And they will probably achieve this in some way. If this will encourage people to play these more than twice will depend on rewards and the encounters themselves, two things we right now know very little about. 
---
* they are supposed to be a stepping stone to raids.   
---
If this succeeds will depend on several things. One key question is: will the open mode and the premade mode be tuned and rewarded differently enough? If yes there is a progression from single player story encounter - &gt; open mode - &gt; premade mode. People will know the boss before ending at the last one and thus might feel more comfortable joining a premade run. The difficulty here should be significantly easier than raids, but warranting some amount of coordination for most groups. If this happens this way and people make it so far the jump to raids could indeed be smaller than before. 
---
* strike missions will evolve from one appearance in one episode to one in later ones.  
---
This could allow introducing and increasing complexity gradually. Imagine vg without blues and greens, once people mastered this they move on to a version that adds these mechanics. This would be terrible for an actual raid, since figuring out the mechanics is part of the fun in progression runs, but would ease beginners into the encounters. 
---
Now if all these potentials will be fullfilled well have to wait and see, but denying them from the outset, when we know so little about the implementation seems rash.
---
Can't wait for Baldur's Gate 3 :d

Blue-hairs at ANet are retconning Zhaitan's gender for social justice woke points.  Best to ignore them.
---
Lets call it "most", just like you did :3
---
Sounds like you put in essentially zero effort while asking nine other people to devote hours of their time to you alone.
---
Play with other "noobs" like we "elitist raiders" did when raids came out. Who do you think taught us? Why aren't you forming a static?
---
Strike missions may not encourage all people to raid, they might encourage those people who can't make the step from PvE or Fractals to raid. Strike missions are like the fractals of raids. They start off simple getting harder with each succession, or so it was advertised. If done right it will work.
---
Comparing it with the war claw doesn't make much sense here. The war claw is a mount that doesn't make WvW easier for PvE players to get into. It's an attraction to encourage people, to add content, etc.. Strike missions do not add an attraction to raids, it doesn't change raids at all, it's something completely different.
---
When it comes to it, though. Execution is key. So all that can be said, on paper it works, let's see if Anet manages to implement something that no game has done yet to my knowledge.
---
"That's for being useless Kormir, you deserve that"
---
BAAAAM 20 STACKS OF BURN IN A SINGLE POST...
---
Hahahaha 10/10 someone get the poor guy a condi cleanse!!!
---
Warclaw was supposed to be a stepping stone?
---
I like how everyone recomends you a big cpu for 4k ...
---
Honestly , raising resolution ONLY raises gpu usage !!!
---
So if your getting 30fps @ 1080p and you go to 4k , it's all on the gpu.
---
For the cpu being @ 720p or 4k ... it's the same thing.
---
So when you face a zerg ( be it WvW or World boss ) and you have a beefy gpu ( 2070+ ) you will be stuck @ the same fps you were before ( cause of cpu cap )
---
Strike missions just sound like renamed bounties to me, I'm gonna assume Anet will just abandon them as well
---
&gt;The thing holding back most people from raiding is the raiding community itself.
---
Bullshit myth
---
True. I‚Äôve had a couple friends who are ‚Äúcompletionist‚Äù ocd -types completely quit the game before getting out of the first map solely because of the heart quests
---
raising resolution doesn't use more cpu.
---
That list is passmark, one of the most unreliable sites there are for benchmarking, it's as valuable as someone guessing numbers.
---
so 500 ppl
---
Did I ? I admited it was known for it then literally said why it's not.
---
Atleast read the full sentence.
---
I tome to 45 for full exotic zerker as I run the intro :')
---
Let me know what you think about it! All feedback welcomed!
---
Read what your wrote. ‚ÄúI agree that WSR is known for being a bandwagon server‚Äù
---
There was a post from a dev that explains exactly why it's not so simple and why GW2 reslies heavily on single-thread performance. It also explains why directx12 doesn't help much either.
---
Maybe if someone has a link to it they could post it. It's a nice insight into technology from a professional.
---
"Known for" doesn't mean it is. Read the full sentence
---
I still have accounts with . in the name. Just like my account email 
---
you.got.baited@gmail.com
---
Yeah, I used to run training sessions and most new players would quit the moment they found out that failing is involved. One even took time to clear out all their bags to "make room for all the loot" before learning that challenging content generally involves a lot more failing than succeeding.
---
But I ended up having to fill teams with experienced raiders due to being unable to find newbies who wanted to learn. Of course, the success rate went up but even then, the new players would take their free loot and never return.
---
That said, I've personally trained around 20 raiders who ended up getting pretty serious about it. Some of whom have overtaken me now. Pretty proud of that.
---
I said I‚Äôm done here, you wrote it, own up to it.
---
Weaksauce.  At min I use 20 if I'm just going for the LV 10 key. If I want all 3, I'll use 64 of them to get the Sigil of Nullification as well.
---
Trying to prevent my Tomes of Knowledge from rising past 4 stacks, but sadly its a losing battle. Curse you WvW and sPVP.
---
You're done only because you know you're wrong, can't admit it and say it out loud because of your ego, but has nothing else to cover it up.
---
&gt;raising resolution doesn't use more cpu
---
It will, there's a CPU overhead for running higher resolutions.
---
It isn't huge and not nearly as much as the additional load on the GPU but it's there.
---
Use 79, so you can map Bloodstone Fen and Dragonfall for a chance at 2 extra keys.
---
I would cry...such a short lived fantasy
---
&gt;So if your getting 30fps @ 1080p and you go to 4k and have a great gpu , you will get exactly SAME FPS. More resolution NEVER uses more cpu.
---
That's wrong, there's always a CPU overhead for higher resolutions. It won't be a huge difference but you definitely won't get the same FPS.
---
&gt;Because casually are less vocal and whiny
---
Oh god, no. When it comes to whine and pressing arrows against redditiquette (tm) casuals are kings! 
---
But for the rest, you are right, casual playrbase need headliners to focus them on something. I don't define "casuals" as people who just don't raid, hardcore openworld player is, technically, possible, but I just don't see it happening in the current situation. But years ago there were certainly more hardcore openworld communities that put quite some effort into organizing pre-nerf HoT metas/TT/even teq. These are all gone. Doing a hero point train is something too, I guess.
---
I'm not going to touch purely social events and RP, because those don't really require game at all and often could be done in a simple chat.
---
\&gt;  And before you tell me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre wrong, this will make people want to try raids as a stepping stone‚Äù tell me more about how the warclaw revitalized WvW after a month. Same argument, same lack of result. 
---
...your argument is nonsensical and needlessly inflammatory. 2/10, come back when you have a semblance of an argument beyond "Stuff ANet promised in the past didn't work out perfectly so this won't either."
---
What benchmark do you recommend for single thread performance?
---
yeah but if your running @ 29fps 1080p ( lets assume beasty gpu ) and go to 4k you will have 28 ? maybe really near the old performance.
---
I actually only run it @ 1440p, but I woudn't be amazed if a 1070 could hold it fine in 4k over 60fps ( without beeing in scenarios with lots of ppl ) and when lower fps it would be just gw2 struggling with ipc.
---
I began doing fractals T1 one month ago myself.. I entered LFG and advertised as ‚Äú6 leveling‚Äù etc.
---
I entered the fractal itself and soon enough ppl joined. I asked at the end of each fractal if everyone is up for the next one and so on...
---
Most fractals T1 could be completed by 1-3 ppl, makes it easier progression, so don‚Äôt wait up for 5 ppl full group..
---
Good Luck and have fun!
---
and it wont really affect the fps much in gw2.
---
Try it.
---
Instanced vs Open World makes a big difference though.
---
Instanced 10-man legendary bounties doesn't sound bad.
---
Being able to share plants that disappeared after the first harvest (by the owner) was clearly a bug, and nobody can say with a straight face that they thought it was going to remain possible.
---
As for me, I'm just happy that the third plot is finally filled in, and I'll keep harvesting normal plants that don't go away until I replace them myself.
---
&gt; bringing Soulcleave/AP/Alacrity/5 Man might (traited).
---
I would add here the vigor through healing orbs which is not to be laughed at. I personnaly love the healing orbs mechanics. The tablet is also a big advatage to rapidly change the people focused by its ability. I personally find it more flexible than the CD dependent druid avatar. Last but not least Staff 5 is a great CC on a relatively low CD.
---
I think you need to be a bit more precise about what exactly is happening.  What is the exact end state for both ascended and non-ascended seeds?  Do they become unharvestable until reset, as they did before cooking got updated?  Or do they truly disappear completely, leaving open space even after the next reset comes?
---
Asura insult. Kinda like dumbass, but more refined.
---
Yes. Unless they wanna get broke....
---
woah slow down buddy, we can‚Äôt have more than 1 pvp player all the way back in the room in guild wars 2. they said so in the living world announcement.
---
and there's no way to disable legendaries/infusions even if you turn high quality character models to lowest :))))
---
The healing on power is not health dependent, it should be always "on". The quickness is applied only when you cross the threshold (and only once every 20 sec). The way you wrote it I have the feeling you expect it to be under the effect of quickness as long as you are under 50 %. Is that the case?
---
Except some carry while others are carried.
---
From what I know:
---
Druid isn't necessarily the first pick for heals. It depends on the boss from what I know.
---
Elementalist can heal the most, but provides less support than others.
---
Druid can heals less, but provides might,fury,spirits and spotter.
---
Heal brand also does great healing and can give quickness (reason everyone uses this for the current meta comp) as well as defenses as you mentioned just as you mentioned.
---
The healing support variant of revenant does less healing than the other classes but gives alacrity, this allows the firebrand to go quickness firebrand dps which is an overall dps win for the group.  It's hard to play the support healer from what I heard because of resource usage. However, if you play full healing revenant you're probably more or less equal with a druid I would say?
---
Oh, and to my knowledge in a 5 man group both quick firebrand healer and alacrigate healer setups do not produce enough might to hit the 25 uptime, hence why bannerslave plays core warrior with phalanx in fractals to get those last stacks out with F1 and crits.
---
Also scourge healer was a thing... hmmm...
---
The healing power is active at all time. The boon will be applied when you drop from &gt;50% to &lt;50% but only happens once in every 20 seconds.

Beware that personal stories are linked to your character. Even if you are at the same instance as people in your group, you won't progress in your own story if you did not open the instance.

Why stop there? Map the Orr zones too, and also do Tangled Paths for the quick key it gives.

There actually IS a heal thief build (even if it is mostly only used on bosses where u would bring boon thief for detonate plasma) which can be used as 2nd healer in raids: [heal thief](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/thief/thief/boon/)

Danger link of the day done

Can confirm, got a quality cut on a level 3 toon killing drakes in Queensdale.

Because Sylvari are shaped by Ronan's image \[a human\] and Ventari's teachings. They are the ones that planted the seed that eventually became the Pale Tree \[and it was also heavily hinted that this seed was a Blighting Tree seed and that they fought Mordrem in order to get it\].
---
Sylvari are specifically humanoid because they remember Ronan.

It was easier and more interesting than the other crafts, that‚Äôs for sure. I hope they do something similar for Jewelcrafting, but I‚Äôm not optimistic.

Invigorating bond it is broken too, it does not scale with healing power.

There are core masteries that need xp. The last one give you full autoloot which is what most people are aiming for. The fact is also that when you have the expansions you do not really play that much in the core game and there for this can take longer then getting your expac masteries.

Any person who do not have the autoloot that core masteries give you should aim to do that because it is worth everything.
---
I would like to further add that renegade has the single strongest area heal in the game with Breakrazor's Bastion, that can heal 25k total or more on its own when fully buffed (10 pulses of 2.5k+) as well as reducing condition damage to allies affected by it *in addition to the tablet bursting 8k+ area heals when buffed*
---
Coordinating does not mean that you have to interact with others on a personal level, all it means is that you need to know what youre doing for that raid encounter, an online guide fixes that. And aside from the supports, dps mainly needs to know where to stand and how to do it's rotation. 
---
I've done my fair share of roles, but mainly stuck to dps, and (hand)kiter.
---
*I'll take your escort example to show you what I mean;*   
---
let's say I'm the portal chrono, the interaction I get is that I ping my portal whenever my group needs to take the portal, most of the time that doesn't even happen because people know what to do when they see a mesmer coming to them.  
---
The most interaction you get here is at the start, when you assign the roles, escort is one of the few that has more interaction on that part than most other raids (together with sab, overseer,deimos, river, etc), but that's still far from personal.
---
personal interaction for me is more than doing your role, it's discussing strategies and taking over a role if a person is lacking the experience etc/ wants to try something new, trying out a new comp and see if it works, etc. But you mainly see that with statics, and not pugs.
---
&gt;Even if I advertise a group myself, no one joins to play if the fractal is not part of the daily reward.

---
I mentioned it to someone on the guild's discord channel and they told me Anet does it. I've also had currency refunded by riot because of purchases just before a sale many, many times, so it didn't seem odd at all. A quick search on the subreddit reveals several examples of this happening.
---
Well, you're not wrong. The announcement of strike missions made me want to get involved into strike missions and anticipate the future strike releases. I don't care about raiding.
---
How would it do in fractals you reckon?
---
I guess you‚Äôve never failed a meta event then. That shit can get more toxic than raids
---
For fractals healbrand is definitvly the better heal if you want one in the first place. Blocks and stability are a lot more reliable than only strong heals. Especially since alot of mechanics deal agony which basically negate your heals. Furthermore can diviner rev pretty much do all mechanics bs had previously done. Therefore it's possible to run power berserk and leave him on the boss fully dpsing all the time. 
---
I found rev heal quite clunky/hectic to play esp since you are also quite vulnerable in conparison to your teammates or a heal brand cause self healing for the rev is quite a lot lower.
---
Tips are always welcome since I like to craft/buy buffs such as the hero banners, food buffs, and utility buffs. Of course, it's always entirely at your prerogative and I rarely advertise for tips because I understand most people that join the trains are likely newer players without much gold.
---
That being said, a typical tip is usually a gold or two per map, or more if you're feeling more generous. As a reference, on my regular 330 hero point trains through 3 maps in HoT, I get 2-5g per tip for the entire train. I've gotten much higher numbers before, but I've also gotten plenty that said their thanks and left without leaving anything.

Yeah, I just did it myself. The only sticking point I have with Dynamics over Human Commoner is the "Simon Says" game you have to play in your home instance. The Human Commoner run you can do with absolutely zero focus.
---
Well I would usually do only those 2 because of portal scrolls and they don't take long to map. But yeah I guess you could do orr too, what's the quickest way to get there?
---
Ahhh but it‚Äôs right.
---
I absolutely adore the Heart of Thorns maps, but a lot of my guildies joke that it's because I know so many fun ways to kill people. And I'm sure you'll get in! We rarely fill both squads within the first 30 minutes, so as long as you're there at the start of the train, you're 99% guaranteed to get a spot &lt;3
---
That because that‚Äôs what they are.
---
Yeah, but you aren't singled out, berated and called trash before being kicked while you have the top dps and failed a mechanic on accident.
---
Draw it yourself (L)
---
Yeah, I don't mind the idea of it but it was horrid to actually read by both browser and pdf.
---
Yup, it's because of this. It has happened with my static too. Quite hilarious.
---
Honestly that's my biggest fear, Anet loves to introduce things and then abandon them or barely support them.
---
Did you read what I commented on. It's to compare hb and heal rev. 
---
Of course optimal is no healer at all and for some bosses you not even bring the qb and instead stack enough quickness at the start. However this is not what I commented on
---
I had the same thing happen to me. I am now dreaming of a world where we can have 4 garden plots  (that being said I would probably be happier with primer plants going into material storage).
---
You sti
---
Heal renegade or herald is a pretty great offensive healer. How much fun and success you will have with it will depend if who you play with, I believe.
---
Heal Renegade is more popular in organized groups, in full clears, in speed clears. It really shines there, and is a great build.
---
Now, if you play in a pug where you have to carry a few scrubs, potentially, you will have a better time with FB and scourge. Scourge is the ultimate carry with its insane barrier application.
---
That's great to keep people alive, but a good group won't need that, and they would prefer a healer who also does DPS
---
But you lose that time having to click on the pop-ups, so it's clearly a DPS loss
---
Well all those resources can be deposited in material storage, so you can just buy 1000 every once and be done with it.
---
So while I disagree with Iviris, Wildstar's failure wasn't due to focusing on hardcore players.
---
It's because aside from housing it did basically everything wrong.
---
&gt; Oh, and to my knowledge in a 5 man group both quick firebrand healer and alacrigate healer setups do not produce enough might to hit the 25 uptime, hence why bannerslave plays core warrior with phalanx in fractals to get those last stacks out with F1 and crits.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Also scourge healer was a thing... hmmm
---
I have a question about this though: which meta DPS build doesn't generate at least some might stacks on their own?  At least none of the ones I play.  So why does it matter if support classes only range to say 20 stacks.  Can't the DPS fill that void themselves through their own rotations?
---
Also, I love playing Scourge Healer, mainly because it plays more like a DPS build than a healer one.  I run the more DPS focused Marshal/Shaman variant.
---
Barrier (which is not reduced by agony), consistent condi cleanse, might and heals, stability (if you run well of power), decent CC via golem/torch/warhorn, and faster revives, all while doing more DPS than a Druid.  Just no way to provide Fury, Quickness or Alacrity (or Aegis).
---
Very fun to play imo.  Sadly ever time I join an existing group, someone invariable offers to swap to healbrand and I'm told to go DPS.  :sadpanda:
---
Thank you :)
---
&gt;IIRC only one of them is locked behind event (near south lane) while the rest just require certain masteries like gliding or so.

By vine walls, they might also be talking about the octovine walls on the outer gates of tarir, in which case, everything that's inside of tarir can't be accessed until after the meta is complete

and infinite scaling healing with the kalla elite. 800 lifesteal with no icd can let your group ignore gorse breakbar
---
Quick! Abuse it before Anet fixes it!
---
I thought the game was lacking repeatable high end content for vets?  Isn't this that? Do we really need more new player friendly stuff?  The entire game seems built for a new player
---
No, it really isn't. If you put in any effort you can find guilds or statics that will help train you, believe it not raiders *want* more blood to fill the ranks and make Anet look at raid content. Or you could, ya know, take some initiative and make your own static.
---
I'm downvoting this.  Your attitude and mentality reek of scorn and disdain, and that isn't going to help people get into raids.  This pretty much reads like you *want* people to fail, and brah, that's not cool; you're just piling up shitty excuses because you have an axe to grind with people that haven't been able to get into raids thus far.  Just let ArenaNet do their thing with Strike Missions, kick back and enjoy some more pug-accessible boss fights.  Maybe even make some friends ehh?
---
I get that it‚Äôs to confirm identity but there are plenty of other ways to do it without requiring submitting a ticket. It‚Äôs been over a week when all I should‚Äôve had to do is enter some information about the account.  I‚Äôm sure all the passwords that I have been trying were at one point the password, it‚Äôs been the same email forever, I still have all the credit card info from when I bought gems etc.    
---
Just seems like waaay too much of a hassle for something simple.
---
Primeval heavy armor is easily the best decision I made.
---
What about Malyck and this other Pale Tree?
---
&gt;in both systems no diference other than gpu usage from going from 1080p to 1440p.
---
1080p -&gt; 1440p is a ~78% increase in pixel count, 1080p -&gt; 2160p is 300%.
---
&gt;Have you tested it ?
---
Not for GW2 since my GPU becomes the bottleneck at even 1080p at times.
---
I've seen more than enough benchmarks for other games to come to this conclusion.
---
&gt;So you think gw2 doesn't struggle with cpu ?
---
Programs use one thread at a time to do everything by default. You have to specifically make them in a way that allows tasks to be split up into multiple threads that can be run concurrently on multiple CPUs ("cores") to complete those tasks in a shorter amount of time.   
---
Having things happen concurrently causes all kinds of problems however that have to be worked around or prevented and these measures don't only cause additional complexity, they can even negate the benefit processing things concurrently could have.   
---
Programming in this way is not easy but since single core performance hasn't improved much the last decade and CPUs expanded horizontally instead (=more cores), it has become more and more necessary for games.  
---
GW2's engine has its roots in times long before consumer chips with multiple cores even existed and the upgrades done ~2010-2012 for GW2 allowed for some concurrency but happened were long before high core counts (&gt;4) became common (2017), so obviously doesn't benefit of much more than 4 CPUs.  
---
GW2 doesn't "struggle with cpu", it has huge CPU performance requirements (this is an MMO we're talking about) and, like any other program not specifically made for concurrency, can't be significantly accelerated by throwing more CPUs at it.   
---
It could be changed in a way that allows for that but it'd be a huge effort and at that point you might as well make a new game from scratch.
---
TL;DR: It's still your CPU limiting the game, your CPU theoretically has more performance than that because there's more CPUs in it but it's complicated to leverage them, especially in software that wasn't made for that from the ground up.
---
&gt;wasn't there a direct relationship between single core IPC and framerates when a lot of ppl are in the same place ?
---
There is never a direct relationship between two things when it comes to PCs and performance, there are way to many factors at play.
---
IPC plays a part in how many instructions can be executed in a time frame but it's not the only factor and is itself a combination of a fuckton of factors.
---
That's often what happens when you have a dozen designers versus ten thousand players.
---
You dont have to actually create an account, you just change the +1 to a +2, +2, +4, etc.
---
The display name is displayed there with the number. Just go all the way through until you get your desired number and then click on create account.
---
Couldn't you just take an asura gate in one of the cities?
---
Well if it keeps happening to you its prob for a reason.
---
Yep, it is the same thing with just about any "hardcore" community. Whether it is PvP or WvW, they complain about their game mode dying and have a long list of complaints. Yet, they overlook the biggest reason it is dying, their behavior.
---
You get some silver per match regardless i think.
---
Ranked matches makes you progress trough the ranked reward track and basically the more you play the higher the rewards in gold (and other currency and rewards)
---
Tournaments are also nice and profitable
---
"Maximum optimal dps" yeah people dont expect you to hit benchmarks but if youre doing less than the bs then yeah youre essentially being carried

 The pet's [healing power](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Healing_Power) is used, not the player's.
---
I like them to. All i want to say is that your worry, that strike missions dont prepare for raids is unfounded, since they arent fundamentally different
---
&gt;a raid all PMing you after you leave a raid claiming you ruined their raid because you didn't do maximum optimal DPS, despite the fact that you actually all completed the raid.
---
The phrase "If everyone around you is the asshole, you're the asshole." is likely applicable here. If your DPS was so poor that literally the entire raid PMd you, you must have had abysmal DPS. You know what the solution is? Running a DPS meter yourself to self-audit. If you're going to participate in a team-environment, you need to pull your own weight.
---
Oooh that's handy. Can you skip lvl 20 and 30 steps and just do 10 and 40 for the keys?
---
Dude he said he pugs in raids, there is nothing coordinated about lfg you either make a squad or you join one thats there.
---
Jormag also forces people though - in Edge of Destiny, the Dragonspawn uses its "persuasion" to effectively hypnotise Zojja into wanting to side with them (until Eir knocked her out of it).
---
Either way, bot hare mental manipulations. They're the same thing, but different methods, even more similar to each other than how Kralkatorrik used the Mind domain once obtaining as showcased in Sandswept Isles (Kralk used it to give his minions shared spacial cognition).
---
Persuasion is basically a subset of the Mind domain, so it makes no sense for it to be a domain in of itself. There was already an overlap when Mordremoth was given Mind back in Season 2, but now the overlap is even greater.
---
SHHHHHHHHH this is gonna get patched so fast wats wrong with you lmao
---
Did you at least have the right amount of AR?
---
You have absolutely no experience, don't get added to experienced groups who don't want to carry you and then complain about the community because that is the easiest solution. Great.
---
You cannot skip any steps of the personal story
---
Just stay out of the mud.  I heard sticks in the mud are terrible.
---
thanks, i was wondering to put in a ticket myself but thought its not really an issue and CS probably has more important tickets to solve.
---
Its almost as if you dont want to waste time with people that literally have no clue what they are doing. If you are new or you vastly underperform compared to experienced you should look for training runs like how everyone else did.

Race 90% of the time is just for story/roleplaying purposes.
---
Don't try to buy Heart of Thorns, it comes free if you just buy Path of Fire.
---
I'll let others go in-depth, but also check out Metabattle.com for current popular builds/playstyles for each class.
---
Have you done any of those things?
---
The games you've mentioned have addictive core gameplay loops which can be fun without learning a huge number of mechanics and have matchmaking systems. In Guild Wars you have to learn a mechanic for each raid boss, plus deal with a toxic community, plus schedule a specific time to raid or put yourself in to a game, which often results in you joining and leaving multiple games.
---
TD map comp can be speedrun??
---
&gt;And that's why nobody wants to play raids with you and why they're creating strike missions for the majority of their player base.
---
And guess what happens when no one eats food and does sub-optimal DPS. You fail.
---
It doesn't matter whether or not you passed. It's socially unacceptable to not contribute in team situations. If you get assigned to a group project for work/school, and your group passes despite you not pulling your own weight, do you think they're not going to care just because you passed?
---
True, but fractals and dungeons already make core masteries trivial to get. Don't forget that a lot of people got core masteries from owning just PoF.
---
Race doesn't really matter at all with class choice. You do get a few race based skills, but none of them are really useful compared to your weapon and utility skills.
---

That should get you started. Sylvari also has some interesting story beats in the HoT expansion. Armor tends to be designed with Human frames in mind first (though that might be changing). Asura have the best animations. Norn and Charr are the story focus for the next living world/saga.
---
ArenaNet never bothered to expand on it. Heart of Thorns was the perfect time to do it and ANet themselves said they just didn't do it.
---
If you want to run a healer in t4s, healbrand is definitely a better choice. With the instabs, having a heal ren stuck with ventari means you can't run kalla+mallyx for strip or jalis for stab etc. Better to run diviner rev.
---
You're missing the fact that everyone on the team contributed and we completed the raid. You are doing exactly what I said people do: because the DPS isn't  "optimal" you're claiming that it's not a contribution. You're so obsessed with the numbers that you're missing the point of the game.
---
Sod hair styles can we get beards that aren't completly trash? I want a mossy beard for my sylvari!

---
Mandragor
---
I almost went from Portland. Glad I didn't.
---
You may be part of the problem, sure.  But removing underperformers can be done without being toxic towards them.
---
The point is that you call not hitting "optimal" DPS "vastly underperforming" when all the raid bosses can be completed easily by a team without ascended gear, without food, etc.
---

Well, I've been drawing on pen and paper since I had like 6 years old, but I never did anything in colour or like that.

I did the science path in my high school, so I've never could prepare myself to truly develop my art. I've passed like 5 years without touching a pen until one and a half year ago when I decided I wanted to leave my degree in computer engineering and do what I like. I've just dedicated 3 weeks to do this the better I could until I go insane.

Ok, I'll bite, how were you contributing to make up for your missing DPS?

For the health of a game, being a whale IS a good thing.
---
Yep.
---
Hello, i'm a raider who spends one gorillion dollars on the game monthly(yes that's an actual number) You are shaming what actual whales are, and unless we get them, me and my raiding guild who single handily funded the previous LS will leave with our money, so you will be left with nothing more than a dying game on life support.
---
We love Guild Wars 2 for what it is. For being different. For its amazing combat system that no other MMO can fill the same hole, that's why we support this game. If this game become another casual mobile cashgrab mmo then we will leave (with our money).
---
No it's not. 
---
See Star Wars Force Arena, a game literally being maintained by whales and it closed down because whales are not enough, they have NEVER been enough. It is a delusion that whales can maintain games on their own.
---
You are right. In the past people had no jobs and no families.
---
The tool tips show visually what is happening but the description is what's important.
---
Gain quickness when your health drops below the threshold. Threshhold is 50% and thus represented. Boon is showed to show you what Quickness is/does
---
After the fullstop, You and your pet gain healing power based on power. Visually represented by the book.
---
Each fullstop is a different effect. Arguably it'd be clear if the sentences were reversed admittedly.
---
All the whales I know and can think of don't go around bragging about being a whale...which leads me to believe you're not actually a whale at all.
---
You'll lose your sanity and wish for the destruction of ArenaNet.
---
Healbrand is not the best fractal healer. It is commonly consider as such by pugs, but good CM groups will flip the renegade and fb making fb condi quick and renegade heal. This is because the dps potential of fb is massively higher than any form of ala renegade. I‚Äôm not sure why most pugs do the reverse, maybe it was what stuck, there wasn‚Äôt a snow crow post, so the meta didn‚Äôt change‚Äîsort of along with why it took forever for pugs to stop running Druid chronicles even after fb and Rene got to where they are.
---
Unsatisfying isn't the same as boring IMO.
---
The professions in this game are fairly hard to summarize because the individual build (weapons+elite spec+traits) can change so much about how the class works and the role it plays.

in terms of gw2 there was always ipc correlation with fps since it's inception.
---
Your inserting general programing talk when we are talking about gw2.
---
So far gw2 remains a heavy single threaded engine , due to that and due to it's being a game relased when we had GTX 7xx , right now with GTX 2060 you can for sure go to 4k without loosing fps.
---
As you know for sure cpu improved a lot due to lots of cores and DDR4 did help, but not enough.
---
Like CEMU , GW2 remains very single threaded and in latest years we haven't seen any sort of big bump , a 2500k @ 4.5Ghz can probably be very near latest cpus in gw2 even with dx912pxy.
---
Due to this , most users have a lot of underused gpu power when gaming in gw2.
---
As I expected here , using nvidia DSR ( right now ) I haven't seen any increase in cpu overhead , in fact I just get ( as I expected ) more gpu usage.

About strike missions and about your casual-gemstora conspiracy theory.
---
You should note that druid healing is actually pretty low for a main healer. They output less healing than a firebrand, tempest, scourge, whatever flavor of revenant, and probably less than a scrapper healer. They get taken because they provide "just enough" healing while having really good dps support.

Don't tell anet it isn't on a weekly cap. Kek
---
If only core maps didn't have that many mandatory hearts.
---
I'd be nice if they reworked core maps to have less mandatory hearts. Maybe by introducing a new type of 'silver heart' that would be basically the same old non-repeatable hearts with a different icon.
---
Then they'll add a much smaller number of repeatable gold hearts like in living world maps, and those would be the ones that would count towards map completion from then on.  
---
Golden repeatable hearts would cover the area of several silver hearts, and have in their vendor all items available in completed silver hearts within their area, plus maybe some daily rewards like pact mapping materials or boxes with materials of the tier matching the level of the heart, and get completed by doing events and silver hearts within then, plus other tasks like riving allies. A single silver heart would complete its corresponding golden heart. 
---
For example, Queensdale has 17 hearts, so they could be divided like this:
---
* Northwest farms: 5 hearts
---
* Shaemoor to Claypool and southwest farms: 5 hearts
---
* Beetletun area: 4 hearts
---
* Godlost Swamp area: 3 hearts.
---
Reducing he hearts from 17 to 4 gold, 17 silver.
---
Not if you autorun on your mount while doing that.
---
Exactly. And yet you dismiss it before it's released.
---

If only they would spend that time helping BenP fix mATs.

I havn't seen any complaints about the new-ish PvP weapons. 
---
The other claim is hard to check: when was the last failable story boss‚Ä¶ I mean not one where you could possibly die, but where you would be punished for dieing and had to start over or something‚Ä¶ mordremoth I guess? Was there a lot of complaint about that fights difficulty apart from the overall "omg HoT is to hard, because dodging is expected now" complaints?
---
I would actually love to go camping. Any places you'd recommend in the US?
---
I dont know why 17k or higher on bosses/phases without much movement is seen as such an impossible feat. Yes Raiders do expect you to know your class and the fight in order to group with them because why shouldnt you. Some of these encounters are 4+ old at this point, there are plenty of rescources to learn them, why is buying food a hassle now? Knowing you dont need to buy red lentil sabossa if youre playing DH should be a no brainer. Again if you dont know all of these things go in a training group or start your own and learn how to play your class so you arent a burden to people. You dont need a lot of free time to raid, i work 6 days a week and i lfg just fine for my clears.
---
Hammer power herald? double digit crits going through the zerg with CoR? then again with drop the hammer? NANI?
---
There is nothing wrong with wanting this, what gave you the idea I opposed that?
---
I would not count those.
---
If you look at them, they are fiery and rocky. While gargoyles did have rocky skin patches, they also had a more overall fleshy appearance.
---
These gargoyless seem to be more like actual stone gargoyles from the mad king's castle, still burning from a fire set to burn the castle down to the ground and leave no trace of it.  
---
The models have been also used in the lava castle in Desert Borderlands, and the lava area in the Desert Highlands ruins, both places with stone gargoyle decorations, which still fits with them being actual stone gargoyle decorations animated after being burned white hot.
---
More like hardcore raiders mad that there‚Äôs no support for raids and harder content cause ‚Äúcausals‚Äù

Best to buy a key from an authorized seller than ebay though, I think Path of Fire is at a discount on one of the authorized ones for $20... Anyway, You can buy a POF key and you SHOULD get Heart of Thorns once everything's set up.

dont like it, leave. did i do it right?
---
Every class that can use a greatsword can use it in a meta PvE build, except warrior. But it's not bad, and used by many people in open world builds.

I think there's a translation issue here.

I‚Äôm just pointing out my observations.
---
And you‚Äôre right people will leave or not participate in those parts of the game.
---
Just don‚Äôt be one of the people on the forum crying about a game or specific game mode dying LOL.
---
The biggest problem is that casuals aren't worth anything in the eyes of raiders. They need to STFU and go grind their braindead 111 zerg bullshit and not act entitled with their insolent wish for additional difficulties. Plus, Anet needs to stop catering to them and put out more and harder raids for the three people that play it.
---
If we'd stop that childing behaviour, we could easily live next to each other.
---
Yeah
---
Let's be honest - most of players are attracted to new ways to play their characters, new build possibilities, and some of them are even waiting for new elite specs for fashion wars.
---
In what game mode?
---
You think without those purchases it would have lasted longer? What is the untapped source of revenue that would have kept it alive as long as those individuals did?
---
I'm unsure if its changed but Elementalist and Mesmer can be pretty tough at early levels, if you want to go ranged ( im assuming you only have Vanilla game) the medium armor classes are kinder, but Necro is a really fun light armor class.
---
Alright, that's what I expected.

Hello! Is there a written guide available that better explains the benefits of ascended cooking?
---
My engineer main has ascended level crafting (weaponsmith, primarily), but I was thinking of using one of my alts to get cooking past 400. Is there any benefit for non-cook characters if a cook character gets the 500 cooking?
---
Also, what are these garden plot things for sale for 1k gems? Are they meant to help with ascended cooking?
---
Conflagration is just terrain altering fire. So really primordius is fire and fire domain.
---
Yes, they're only available after you've trained all other core options and are level 80.
---
Buying the expansion will come with a free level 80 booster iirc so if you really wanted to you could use that to jump straight into the elites, but I think you'll enjoy your time more if you go through at least one character the normal way for 1-80 to explore the maps, get a feel for general movement and combat, and figure out if you like that core gameplay loop of combat before you buy in.
---
Yeah but I mean meta builds. I think deadeye meta built is rifle / dagger/dagger no? 
---
I completely forgot about mesmer pistol off-hand.
---
Hmm, about 3 hours in total, another hour added if we do dragonfall meta
---
I specified that. "unless you're shame framed for warhorn rotation" though I suppose it could have been clearer. Warhorn rotation alone needs shame frame, or use storm spirit + needing a chrono SoI to extend since the fury duration even at 100% boon duration from druid only provides 10/16 % uptime-with-perfect-alacrity

---
Oh yes. Of course it depends on the build, but power reaper annihilates everything in its path in shroud form while condi scourge can solo some group content with their AoE sand wraith insanity.
---
guess you got a couple bad groups then. only nasty pms ive gotten were about joining an "exp group" and calling people out for completely fucking up mechanics. there are definitely some seriously toxic players in raids/T4s, but theyre pretty rare in this game. tbh just leave and find another group or grow thick skin, cause you know, sticks and stones and all that.
---
There was an area with 10-12 of them and a boss in the Iron Horse Mine zone just before you entered Anvil Rock.  My assumption was that they were forgotten or are being saved for treks farther north.

---
Pussied out after everyone called him out on his bullshit
---
Why would it be illogical? (In gw1 elementalist was quite a weak DPS class in endgame content) But no: Necromancer does not pull higher DPS than an elementalist in a vacuum in any game mode.  However, actual encounters, especially in PvP or WvW are not in a vacuum. There are different things to take into consideration, like abilities to stay alive without sacrificing too much damage, or the ability to rip boons. There is a question like hitbox size, amounts of adds and vulnerability to power dmg or condi dmg to be taken into consideration. 
---
Also: Yes elitespecs can only learned upon reaching lvl 80 and the expansion content is also designed for lvl 80, so it's a fair decision to wait until you hit 80. However there are a few restrictions to f2p accounts, such as only having access to certain cities after reaching a certain level, no full access to chat and no full access to the trading post. So having the full game earlier does provide some value.
---
You wouldn't want to use Shortbow for Shadowstep healing. The best option is spamming Sword 2 as the total initiative cost is lower and you heal on the step forward and the step back.
---
However, it is a completely awful healer and you should never run it. The modifier for the heal on Shadowstep is far too low, so you'll barely eek out 1.6k heals per Shadowstep in full harriers with healing infusions, Monk runes and all the other associated niceties. You are also limited to local healing around the player, aside from Shadow Refuge, so that also sucks.
---
Don't do it. It isn't worth it.

not to mention the "oh shi*" button. WoB (wobbling) cast at the right moment before dying can revive yourself to do it again, chaining your pulsing(if you have it on) barrier can also save the rest of the folk.

Renegade is an insane healer with perma alac + might.
---
can¬¥t speak for raids, but in fractals a Firebrigade (quickbrand + heal rene) is meta from what i got in static T4 + CM groups because a Quickbrand while providing boons still has very high DPS, way more than the oposite comp with a hybrid rene and healbrand would have.

That was the one where you died, right?  I felt a bit emotional, but was there something exceptionally sad in there?

Great nostalgic format. To me, this kinda felt like reading the manuscript that came with boxed Guild Wars (1) Prophecies  while waiting the game to finally launch. /me putting back the Guild Wars box to the shelf next to Baldur's Gate 2... now why does that make me feel old again? \^\^
---
okay.
---
Actually i didnt assume anything i just said if it happens often. Yeah i get it i pug too lfg sucks.
---
I think pistol isn't highly represented because only 3 of the 9 classes even have access to them iirc
---
I use hammer in my swap, because not having a ranged weapon is never an option.
---
I am not implying anyone is like me tbh, cut the crap.
---
I am just saying even with a family and a demanding job I can pug whenever I can and feel like it.
---
Agreed.
---
Agreed
---
This is a very common social construct I don't agree with. I didn't have to do any of that just to raid because I didn't see anything in the process as a wall, I guess.
---
&gt;Healbrand is first pick for fractals.
---
what, that's bullshit. that's what pugs do because they don't know any better. 
---
in fractals, renegade heal is the go to (if you really need a healer)
---
in raids the best healer would be tempest because it affects 10 people, but also you wont find it in pugs, only in static groups that actually research stuff and make educated decisions.
---
Just a couple quick questions (I think) from a returning player...
---
Is the Revenant class available to all or just people who own the expansions (planning to buy soon)?
---
How can I increase my movement speed? In general as well as specifically for my Engineer (current main).
---
Thank you!
---
... I would kill for this hairstyle.
---
Raids sellers should be banned
---
do a couple fractal or dungeon paths and those masteries take barely any time... and you'll need to do fractals anyway more than likely to get enough mastery points to max it.
---
how in the god damn hell is that the only group he's been able to contact
---
has he looked at lfg? 200g is overpriced for sure
---
You cover your subgroup with horn, storm + the chrono's pack runes or the firebrand's axe will cover the other subgroup. I'd not shame-frame a druid, those CA cast times are too important.
---
Bone Dragons were raised by Khilbron, and all other Orrian undead seem to have disappeared too, implied that they either got killed off or were made into risen after Zhaitan's rise. So I wouldn't be so quick to count Bone Dragons - many may have been turned into the risen dragons, after all.
---
While Fog Nightmares have disappeared, other Nightmares do show up and in the same general regions (Shades, Aatxes).
---
Gear a heal scourge for a few gold and do it yourself.
---
You can do it for free
---
I use Sword in PvP for the teleport. In PvE you can take the meta power DPS builds that use Greatsword and Scepter/Focus and just replace the Scepter with the Sword. You lose the range but gain a little more mobility without losing damage. Plus it looks cool. Even the Focus can be replaced at little cost, if you prefer Torch or Shield in the off hand.
---
warrior hammer is actually quite good as a CC swap, iirc it has more than mace for certain cc-duration intervals
---
&gt; maybe it was what stuck, there wasn‚Äôt a snow crow post, so the meta didn‚Äôt change‚Äîsort of along with why it took forever for pugs to stop running Druid chronicles even after fb and Rene got to where they are.
---
We got a winner!
---
Same reason why ppl play double druid in raids even tho pretty much any healer is better as a scnd healer than druid.

I can't tell what's sarcasm or not anymore... This is the state we're in boys.

Behemoths (both Tyrian snake-like variants and Elonian quadrupeds), Simians, Abominations, Cobalts, and until PoF, Hydras had disappeared (none show up in Ascalon or Ring of Fire). The Saurians of GW1 vanished except for raptors, though we got new kinds of saurians with HoT. One may count gargoyle/mergoyles but they got a single line acknowledging such (there are a type of gargoyles that show up with Halloween but they're visually drastically different).
---
That's totally fair and I'm glad you're enjoying raiding!
---
It's absolutely a wholly subjective thing, I guess my point is that I suspect that it feels this way for a lot of "casuals". 
---
I'm sure other games are like this, if not worse, as well, but since gw2 is one of like 3 games I play, and the only MMO, I have no other comparison. It just feels like the raiding community accepts and embraces this idea of a learning curve that's so steep it seems like a wall to those below it, while being invisible to those above. 
---
There just seems to be this widely accepted catch-22 of raiders saying they want new players to join the mode, but their idea of a new player is one who already is geared, familiar, well practiced, and can seamlessly step into a raid without any issues and contribute meaningfully. To most outside of the raiding community, this looks more like wanting "more veteran players" rather than "new players". 
---
Sure there's raid training, but even then, 1) most of the community only wants "new players" that have trained to the point they're no longer new,  2) clearly and vocally neither wants nor accepts new players who haven't already become veterans in their own right, and 3) even the training guilds, from what I've seen, expect the "complete novice" to have devoted the time and resources into having a complete meta build, memorized rotation, and full knowledge of the mechanics of the raid...to which I can't help but ask: if someone already has all that, what is the training even for?
---
In other words, even what the raiding community seems to consider very low standards is seen by most of the casual community as a big time and resource investment and commitment just to try something they're not even sure if they'll like. Regardless of whether you see it as a wall or not (and clearly you didn't because you are raiding), the salient point is that many of those who don't raid *do* in fact see it as a wall. 
---
And getting back to the original point (sorry for the wordiness), those walls, perceived or otherwise, are a big part of what looks to be avoided through strike missions...which will be much more likely (imho) to become "raiding lite for casuals" than "stepping stone to raids". Sure some will make the leap...hell if I try them and like them, I might be among them...but I suspect for most, it'll be seen as "raid style, but without all the crap that keeps me away from raids".
---
Just my humble predictions!
---
&gt; maybe it was what stuck, there wasn‚Äôt a snow crow post
---
i think this is the saddest part of this community, people don't use their own brains and wait for someone else to do the thinking for them, and then some braindead person goes and says something untrue, people follow that, is sticks, then everyone defends this bad idea and ppl who make sense are instead downvoted to shit and it just gets worse and worse
---
It likely is that no one was there to absorb the brunt of the power of Dhuum, or some other handwavy reason.  If you kill one of the gods, they explode unless otherwise contained, and it does a LOOOOOT of damage.  The fact that NOT killing one of the gods but merely battling him in to submission (abaddon) caused the crystal sea to become the Crystal Desert/Desolation should give a relatively solid reason why we're just imprisoning him instead.
---
I'm sure you with your monthly 20,000 euros (1,6 million gems) will have no problem affording this.
---
CoF Path 3, 10k AP+
---
You either have a really selective memory, or just don't know what you talk about.
---
Its called googling a 7 year old game.
---
if you already saved up on the: 3 heat stones, 10 Bloodstone Brick, 5 Deldrimor Steel Ingots, 3 Dragonite Ingots, 5 Spiritwood Planks, 1 Elonian Leather Squares. Going from 400 to 500 will just take up one night of work (about 1 to 2 hours). it should be in everyone's interests to do it just for the composting salvager and free extra rare crafting items for the extra cash.
---
I find garden plots a huge waste unless you have a lot of stuff in your home instance and visit it daily to collect all the stuff.
---
Copy that. Thanks for the input. It might be better to save my gems then for more bank space or something.
---
Troll boi :D
---
&gt;&gt;fan made dx12 mod proves it actually helps with performance
---
&gt;
---
&gt;It doesn't help all *that* much with fps, what it helps with most is consistency.
---
Definitely saw increased frame rate in pretty much everything in GW2 with the dx12 add-on, especially in low fps areas. World Bosses are actually playable without me having to lower graphics settings lol
---
It's about the journey. Why do people even play it in the first place.
---
Ok but it‚Äôs just a bit long and tedious to replay
---
anyone wanna get me these pins? I tried to buy them but my cat needed treatment and now im just a poor boy lol
---
Not sure how it evolved in the last year but last ime I sold Matthias it was 60-80 Mystic Coins, 200g is waaaaay too much.
---
Even if the price changed a bit (and probably to something lower) it shouldn't have varied enough that it reached 200g. Maybe they misunderstood and it was for the full wing (which would maybe a bit cheap but not unsurprising).
---
Also getting a price in Gold and not MC is a bit weird in my book.
---
Well that's fricking adorable
---
(Laughs). A heal ren can never 1 heal a no green vg. You disagree but don‚Äôt lay facts. A harrier heal ren can not 1 man heal a no green vg with a breeze. A harrier Druid can, And it‚Äôs better then a heal ren. A harrier Druid is not better then a temp healer or heal firebrand. Yet a heal ren is best raw heal? The best raw healer is tempest and it‚Äôs a none fact. Take a heal ren into wvw and get wrecked. Take a heal temp or heal scrapper and your safe in wvw. Heal ren is not in the top as raw healing at all. It‚Äôs on the lower heal side. If you say so, then 1 man heal a no green vg with your heal ren. I mean there‚Äôs plenty of videos that a 1 man Druid can out heal on a no green vg. But a heal ren? Lul. You can 1 man heal a no green with a heal temp. 
---
Anyways...... I know you feel bad about it. But it doesn‚Äôt disqualify the abilities a heal ren supplies. Assassins presence + alac + fury and some might. Which is great to go with the new comps that are out.
---
Man I guess if you‚Äôve never experienced it then it doesn‚Äôt exist... LOL
---
I‚Äôm not trying to single out raiders. I‚Äôm taking about the adult player base.
---
There have been plenty of threads talking about the ‚Äúgreat friendly‚Äù community here but that‚Äôs not entirely true. Plenty of people commenting on their experience with our wonderfully toxic community.
---
This game is and will never be hardcore. All the ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù raiders are disillusioned and kidding themselves about how hardcore this content actually is.  
---
I do enjoy this game and I want it to thrive. My original point was to bring to light that players are getting bullied and it‚Äôs turning people away from participating in the more niche content....which is actually more fun.
---
To get the skyscale, you're going to need access to all ls4 maps (if you don't already).  Getting the skyscale is a fairly lengthy process, and has a bit of time-gating associated with it.  I'd suggest taking a look at a guide to see if you have what you need in order to get it, or what you need to get first.  I found that having the griffon mount made some of the skyscale collections much easier.  But ultimately, do what you enjoy, and don't get consumed by collections to the point it's no longer fun!
---
the permanent ones or the ones you buy from karma vendors?
---
Normal price is 60-80 MCs. But then again, you asking here IMO isn't cool in the first place.
---
Lots of enemies have been remodeled though. GW2 trolls don't at all look like the GW1 trolls (which I find a shame, because I loved the original ones)
---
I kinda think its a bad idea most of the time to join with boon thief, unless the lfg specifically asks for it, not because it isn't good (the opposite), but because it requires the rest of the squad to swap around you for that specific boss. 
---
Similarly, if you join an almost full Matthias run as boon thief, its very likely that they already have 2 chronos and no alacRen. So you would need the chronos to swap to dps and one of the healers to go alacRen.
---
What I'm saying here basically is that it is too much of a hassle for your average pug group to try and get chronos that can also dps for that specific boss, and then go back to boon chrono, and an alacRen, if you dont have one already. Even if its the much better comp and all the boons make the fights much easier. 
---
Not sure what happened to your case as the post is now deleted.
---
Man! You must be real tough! Therefore making toxic behavior acceptable.
---
Material storage (1 upgrade makes huge difference, additional ones arent needed most of the time) and inventory bag slots (this is character wide, not account wide) are pretty good upgrades if you already have copper-fed salvage kit.
---
Take a guess.
---
permanent (ones from gem store). But how does that change the value of each type of material?
---
Oh jawgoues you crazy
---
Get gud ammmiriteee!???
---
Plenty of random whispers followed by a block or set as invis in spvp lol. Cause they salty about losing. Of course it‚Äôs never their fault since they are practically professional guild wars 2 players.
---
Season 3 meta currency vs Season 4 meta currency.
---
I'm not sure which is better at the moment.
---
I didnt say that it doesnt exist. I said that just because you experienced it a few times, doesnt mean that it happens all the time in every single group.
---
You cant get bullied if you simply block the offender. It's not like they can do something about it or care about you. They just don't like wasting their time and have no communication skills. 
---
Are people quitting open world metas because someone called them a scrub for not using CC? No because they arent even reading the chat or paying attention to negative stuff. Your arguments are flawed.
---
volatile magic is better as you carn turn it into gold easily through trophy shipments that ypu buy on any ls4 map. 
---
I like using unbound aswell as i find myself buying ascended trinkets through ls3 maps and you need unbound magic for that aswell.
---
Overall go for volatile. With ls5 they could intreduce a new currency and new tools though.
---
I think it was a daredevil with staff that switched to pistol/pistol when he had to keep distance. But I guess DE uses dagger dagger rifle, yes.
---
Possibly for the same reason the dumped the spider mount.
---

---
Thank why does he want to kill matt
---
Behemoths appear in Verdant Brink, they look like little armored hippos with saber teeth
---
Volatile is great as you can never have enough of it. It can be directly turned into gold by using it to buy shipments , afaik trophy ones are still most profitable. 
---
Unbound is not awful. But it's only real use is getting lws3 trinkets and backpacks. And UM is very easy to get by farming winterberries and eating them.
---
I far prefer the Volatile tools.
---
A bunch of stuff coincided. Lots of people might have minstrel firebrand experience from WvW. Teapot extolled the virtues of heal firebrand in raids on his stream for a long period of time, which filters through. Lots of people were excited to use diviner gear when it released, which happened less than a month after the balance patch which shifted the fractal meta in favour of firebrand/renegade comps. A number of the people who actively updated the major fractal builds website quit the game, so there was no "guiding light" as it were, and the pugs were left to themselves. People have acquired the notion that heal renegade is difficult to play, when its actually absurdly strong.
---
Keys *cost* 84 gems, their *value* is random and a lot more difficult to measure
---
I find the irony of your post talking about acting grown up and also being full of childish language to be quite entertaining.
---
no one plays wvw i meant.
---
no the game mode.
---
I‚Äôm wasn‚Äôt really talking about open world meta, friend.
---
And like I said before...these aren‚Äôt ‚Äújust a few‚Äù instances and not just experienced by little ol‚Äô me.
---
Also this isn‚Äôt just about me so please stop trying to make it so. The amount of people want to spvp or raid is waning and not enough people want to partake cause some view those modes as highly toxic. 
---
And ‚Äúwasting time‚Äù!? Bitch please, everyone is wasting time if they are playing a video game. Get over yourselves. Unless you‚Äôre a streamer making that ad money off of viewers watching you play this game, this time is all leisure lol.

Maybe they were asked to remove it ? Since , afaik , it's directly lifted from D&amp;D and not a mythical beast in any way otherwise.
---
Is this a one-character only thing? If I want the cooking station on two characters am I able to take them both through the ascended cooking adventure or do I need to pick one?
---
In terms of design, definitely. But every raid so far has had beautiful custom assets, models, animations, etc. that almost certainly contribute to their long development time, and that could be bypassed by reusing story content of similar visual quality
---
If you complete the 'quest' that comes when you level past 400, all your characters will be able to harvest the new seeds and loot high quality meat. Even if you don't do any ascended cooking, you can sell them for good money
---
You think that there's zero trade under non capitalist systems? What?
---
I think you should probably start by looking at the difference between private property and personal property. You absolutely can trade, store and destroy what is yours.
---
Eir is by far the hardest phase of that mission for me
---
You are leaving aside skill. Reapers and Scourges can hit the high end of their benchmarks with little skill. Weavers are and Tempests don't. They need dedicated skilled players to hit the high benchmarks. So yes , you often see  Reapers pulling more than some elems.
---
i actually have copper and silver... I can't remember when I bought the silver-fed one, but I use it mostly for yellow level items. :D
---
I've expanded material storage once (500 now, I think?).
---
Druid is enough healing for players who aren't taking too much extra damage, yeah. It's not as good at carrying bad players as the other healers.
---
You get all bonuses without popups :P Throw in boosts and go. xD
---
I‚Äôd say at least one of you play thief. You can have a lot of fun in a close knit group with stealth and Thief‚Äôs new preparations.
---
You still make no sense.
---
Did you ever look into rev?
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PmQAYlQJEiiQTEqiQhEagnfA-zxIYwogvIquA8dA-e
---
Just look at natural harmony. It heals about 11.5k not factoring in outgoing healing. With outgoing healing its at least 17k. You basically fully heal any class with a single skill in a second. It cant get more bursty than that.
---
ah i see, a raid buyer ive seen alot of those, if thats the case then he shouldnt mind paying 200g for matthias. I know a few people that are so bad in the game with legendary armor, or people who barely online or never branched out of open world pve, only 1 way to get it. Money shouldnt be a problem for your friend, because that is hes only solution.
---
KAPPA
---
Yeah man. You‚Äôre def a boss.
---
You must have zero problems in life since you‚Äôre trying so hard to cut me and my opinions down.
---
Also You‚Äôre missing the while point to the thread so good job.
---
I must have affected you very much!
---
Is that stated somewhere?  It seems to me that the email just goes to your account and you receive it with whichever character you happen to log in to.
---
Anyone who legit played through HoT thorns on a glass Ele deserves a unique title "Did it the hard way"
---
Seriously. ArenaNet already has a template for Strikes and I'd be very surprised if they didn't follow it.
---
The Christmas "raid boss" is the template. If they have a similar level of difficulty and mechanics to that boss in Strikes, I'll call it a success. That boss was perfectly tuned as a stepping stone into raids. And all of his mechanics could target anyone, meaning you had to learn them. And people did learn them. He had a very high clear rate.

The art is beautiful, much better than the outfit itself xD
---
In order to manage your expectations, you should check out this page: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Personal_story
---
The answers are:
---
1. Yes, but sometimes you'll need to "first we do my mission, then we do your mission" because you're different races or different Orders.
---
2. There's no trinity. Every profession handles it's own healing, etc. That being said, it'll be simpler if at least one person is playing a thug who's good at getting into the enemy's face.
---
3. Race matter a *lot* in the early missions because the early missions are racially specific. More details on that below.
---
3b. When you create your accounts, make sure you all select the same "World". It won't matter at all until/unless you someday decide to check out the World-vs-World game mode, then it'll matter a lot.
---
Here's what's going to happen to your characters:
---
**Intro mission** - You're on your own. This happens right after you create your character and there's no way for anyone else to help you with it. It's also pretty much impossible to fail, so no biggie. It's **VERY IMPORTANT** to know that after this mission you're just kind of dumped into the world and won't be able to do any more personal story missions until you get to character level 10. Wander around killing things for a while. It doesn't take long.
---
**Chapter 1 (min character level 10)** - You play five missions specific to your race.
---
* From this point on, it's possible to have other people join your party and help you with your missions. It's important to note that since each race has different missions, if a human and a charr want to play together, they will need to do all of the human missions so the human gets credit and also do all of the charr missions so the charr gets credit. More missions = more fun.
---
* These five missions will be arranged into one of three different tracks. Which track you do is determined by the first question you answered during character creation. For example, are you street rat, commoner, or nobility?
---
* One of these missions will have an A/B choice which determines what your next mission is. For example, at the end of the 3rd human mission, you make a choice. That choice determines whether you get sent to HumanMission4A or HumanMission4B.
---
**Chapter 2 (min character level 20)** - You play four missions specific to your race and *also* the answer you selected to question 2 during character creation. One of the missions will have an A/B selection.
---
**Chapter 3 (min character level 30)** - You play four missions specific to your race (3 with A/B options) plus one mission specific to your selection of which Order you decide to join (Durmand Priory, Order of Whispers, Vigil). Don't worry about the whole "Order" thing for now. It'll make sense when you get to it.
---
---- This is the end of the Race specific missions ----
---
---- This is the start of the Order specific Missions ---
---
**Chapter 4 - Order Neophyte (min character level 40)** - You play five missions specific to your Order (1 with A/B). Races are now all combined which means a human and a charr who have both joined the Vigil and who are both ready for Chapter 4 can do the missions together and both get credit for doing the mission. If one is Vigil and one is Durmand Priory, then they'll need to do both the Vigil and Durmand Priory missions so both get credit. The missions are very different, so lots of fun.
---
**Chapter 5 - Helping Hands (min character level 50)** - You play three goofy missions where you reach out to help one of the five unplayable races (grawl, hylek, ogre, quaggan, skritt).
---
**Chapter 6 - The Battle of Claw Island (min character level 60)** - You play seven missions. 
---
* Missions 1, 3, 4a/b &amp; 6 are Order specific.
---
* Missions 2, 5, 7 are shared regardless of race/order.
---
---- This is the end of the Order specific missions ----
---
**Chapter 7 - Forming the Pact (min character level 70)** - You play six missions. The first mission has an A/B/C choice which determines which tract you'll play for the other 5 missions. One of those 5 also has an A/B.
---
**Chapter 8 - Victory or Death (min character level 80)** - You play thirteen missions with some having A/B options and some having Order options.
---
So, to finish your personal story, you will play through 49 of the 308 possible missions. Once you're done with that, you've "finished the game" as it was originally shipped in 2012 and all that's left for you to do is:
---
* Watch [the 3-hour video of Living World season 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d17gwV4vXOg) (LWs1 was truly "live" and can't be replayed unfortunately)
---
* Play through all of Living World season 2
---
* Play through all of Heart of Thorns story
---
* Play through all of Living World season 3
---
* Play through all of Path of Fire story
---
* Play through all of Living World season 4
---
* Play through all of the currently unreleased Living World season 5 because it's probably finished before you get around to playing it.
---
That's all.
---
Welcome to bug wars 2
---
I don't get what u want to do about it though. You can't make all the bad eggs suddenly nicer by complaining about it, especially with all these vague examples that clearly almost nobody else is relating to. Perhaps you're doing something to attract the negative attention for it to happen so frequently? Or it's just a pvp thing. 
---
This really is a situation where u just deal with it and move on, which clearly isn't something you want to hear but there's nothing else to do about it. It's ironic you talk about maturity when a lot of your replies to people are equally immature. The most mature thing you can do when faced with stuff like this is hold your tongue and look past it. Just being an adult doesn't make you mature, people will still be petty and childish up until their deathbed.
---
&gt; code switching
---
I hadn't heard this term before. According to Google:
---
&gt;the practice of alternating between two or more languages or varieties of language in conversation.
---
Does that mean that English is not your first language, or that you're using multiple linguistic styles to emphasize a point?
---
&gt;You don‚Äôt need to speak like an up tight plain Jane to be mature.
---
No, but there is something ironic about making a conversation about acting grown up and using the following word-choices:
---
* grown ass adults  
---
* man-babies  
---
* am I that much of a loser in life
---
I do not think I've personally heard anyone use language like that since High School.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm just venting and bringing awareness to the situations I have witnessed and have heard about from fellow community members.
---
Of course there‚Äôs not fix to the problem. 
---
But you can do your part and not be an jerk if you can or not support that type of behavior in your guild or group.
---
Why do we need a reason? Not every creature needs to be moved from gw1 to gw2
---
It crashes because its 3rd party mod. If it was properly implemented within the client it wouldnt crash.
---
I had a similar bug, my guess is that the new system can't kick you back into queue or out of it; on failure to find the PvP map. 
---
So far I have tried 2 things: 1) not PvP for the day and wait out the timer/reset. 
---
2) wait a couple of seconds and waypoint far enough in the same map to hit the loading screen. 
---
This a common problem btw.
---
Yes, within two weeks of PoF's release. I thought is was a at least a lvl below the Mordremoth fight at the end of the HoT story, pre-nerf. 
---
But I'm not the average Solo'er to be fair. Probably the hardest boss I've solo'd would either be the Mushroom Queen HP in Tangled Depths or the boss at the end of the Arah Dungeon. I'd put the Chak Driver in TD and Risen Knight in Malchor's Leap up there too.
---
This is only the 10th time I've seen this vid posted... This month
---
Forgal- Misty eyed farewell. There goes a Hero.
---
Tybalt- Tear jerking farewell. There goes a friend.
---
Sieran- Brain.exe has failed.
---
For someone who just gear up heroes in ascended I'd say UM. Easy access to all stats ascended trinkets, backpacks and breather. For ever.
---
For someone in longer term goals like legendaries it's VM. Cheap trophies are a thing, also an option to get gold selling them.
---
Nope. I've had mine addressed to an old character name I haven't used in 2 years. And that toon has 1/3rd the hours of my main.
---
Cute drawing :)
---
Since OP is doing story etc. Theyll get some ascended loot they can slot AR into as well. LS3 especially will help them along with the stat-selectible trinkets.
---
That's entirely up to you, friend. Just depends on whether or not it's important for you to have the whole trilogy in the same language.
---
But...you are a casual yourself!
---
This game isn‚Äôt at all hardcore. Unless you‚Äôre multi boxing more than 2 instances and playing the TP. 
---
TP is the only real hardcore content in the game currently.
---
If you think stating an opinion and observation is crying, you‚Äôre wayyyyyyyy off base,  friend.
---
I can't speak for the GW2 books specifically but usually any book is worth getting in its original language so long as you actually intend to reread it. Most forms of wordplay are incredibly difficult to translate properly and some puns or obscure double meanings simply get lost in translation.
---
Yah, back when I was doing trains a lot I stopped doing Serpent's Ire because it doesn't matter how many you have if you don't have 8-10 that know how to break blue bars you can spread out it's a pointless endeavor in frustration.
---
What
---
- Warclaw only is a good one. Gives mount but no fancy leap/evade/float skills.
---
- no trading post (only use found gear)
---
alternatively, limit yourself to the gear level of the map you're in. So no gear of lvl 15+ in queensdale for example
---
So long as im not oow its ok
---
The other 2 factions seemed like cheap imitations after that
---
I was hoping this day would come!  I love all the crafting and I have had them all at Level 500 for many years.  It seemed so sad to see cooking at level 400.  I finished the quest line and was at Level 500 in 2 days, it was so fun!!  :D
---
Lorewise it does need a reason, and thats the point of his comment.
---
Double digit crits? I had no idea it could hit for over 10 damage!
---
ELEVEN FUCKING DAYS.  They can hot patch in a fix for their shitty ascended food, but for something we PAID for, we have to way over a week and a half for these idiots to fix something.  Go fuck yourselves, lazy net.
---
Great attention to detail my friend!
---
My point still stands. 
---
You‚Äôre being really up-tight you know!
---
Torch is also meta on any class that can use it
---
hi rude asura :)
---
&gt;You‚Äôre being really up-tight you know!
---
Sorry to be a bother. Hope you have better luck with the community in game. Cheers
---
Yeah it was a joke. I‚Äôve never played the TP. If I actually needed coins in a pinch, I run that credit card ;)
---
I just remembered seeing the one video with like a dozen accounts making a shit ton of trades. That was hardcore. But I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre still a casual tp pleb compared to him!
---
The first time I played through this level, it DISCONNECTED ME RIGHT AFTER TALKING TO JOKO AT THE VERY END.
---
I had to replay the whole thing from start to finish.
---
I think there is no easier way to put it
---
I bought it thrice, hell yeah!
---
Cheers!
---
Nothing will change realistically but just venting like everyone else is on this forum!
---
We celebrated 6 years of dungeon recipes being bugged on 3rd September. Anet don‚Äôt give a fuck about bugs
---
Lol. Twitch meme garbage. Way to generalize a bunch of good people with total assholes.
---
Dude, I've only been playing pvp for years. With a bit of pve for mounts and story. You'll be just fine.
---
Well, they gave a fuck about the cultivated plants bug.
---
I'm in favour of them being added. They're a useful vehicle to gate daily rewards behind, e.g. the ability to buy a handful of map currency every day from the heart vendor.
---
Most of them are trivial to complete anyway, they just require you to (*gasp*) play the game for a minute or two.
---
Also Engineer: Explosive
---
*Repeatable hearts SUCK!* Completely agree. Having to go through the same thing over and over just to use a merchant makes no sense to me. I feel if my character has unlocked a heart it should be unlocked forever. The changes I suggest below for existing core map hearts could also be applied to repeatable hearts in a way to make them less cancerous also.
---
I would go further in fact with hearts, even those in the core map. I think the "cost" in terms of input for completing those should diminish with each character. For example, the first time I play a map my first character completes the heart. Next time I bring a character to that map I need 75% of the original input to compete the heart, 3rd character 50%, 4th 25% and 5th and all subsequent characters 10%.
---
I like map completion and I don't want to dumb it down, but I see no point in making players repeat this content in total on multiple characters.
---
&gt; I don't know if there is anyone in this community who actually likes repeatable golden hearts
---
Anet actually implemented them because much players of the community asked for it. 
---
I personally like repeatable hearts. You don't *need* to do them daily, but it's a good way to implement daily rewards aside from daily quests.
---
Anet made single useless statement - expansion is not ruled out. This means none is in progress and most likely wont be soon.
---
If the Anet solution to this feature tunrs to be a downgrade to this already amazing feature, I'll be really sad to let go AcrDPSBuildtemplates. Its' such an awesome no-bs solution to one of the most usefull fetures needed for end-game-ish ....i'll said it again, thanks for everything @Deltaconnected
---
I don't think the same tier system would need to get added to raids, just an easy mode with less rewards meant for learning, so I agree with you on that
---
I do not mind repeatable hearts. The only thing that bothers me is not being able to use the vendor again until the heart is repeated.
---
Doing the heart once should give permanent access to the vendor. 
---
Repeating the heart should refresh the daily purchases in the vendor.
---
Send in a support ticket and get a refund if you‚Äôre that ireful
---
repeatable hearts are fine imo... to an extent. the issue is that since PoF ANet made many of them insanely grindy to even complete, set very high overall currency requirements to unlock everything in an episode, and made hearts in many cases the best source of those currencies.
---
I use warrior hammer because warrior hammer looks and feels cool :(
---
They too busy working on their other ip
---
Oh damn that‚Äôs pretty cool. Still have yet to get far enough in the game where the economy and using the Trading Post is part of it.
---
I love this new "you can't complain about anything" attitude people have about shit they don't care about.
---
....that‚Äôs.....not my tone at all. I‚Äôm saying join the club because Anet has a penchant for not doing anything about bugs. Don‚Äôt take ur anger out on someone who‚Äôs equally annoyed Anet‚Äôs aversion to fixing their content
---
I really don't get what's the fuss about these. If anything they're sources of easy XP and map currency
---
the title should be "please don't add repeatable hearts that aren't thought out and balanced to season 5"
---
I lost my ever loving sh-it at "useless like ginger". Fuck man this game is just meme simulator and it keeps getting better by the day.
---
If you're not playing peak times or on overflow maps toxic metas happen a lot, especially fails where you have enough but people fuck up
---
My entire original point is about toxicity from average to below average players in Open World PvE (OPvE) in comparison to my raid toxicity experiences so i'm glad we agree on that
---
&gt; I was having a blast
---
&gt; I only made it to like level 20 before I stopped playing.
---
?????
---
I guess my earlier example was confusing, I said the last episode because that's the last time I put a lot of time into the game, if you put a lot of time into the last raid then they may have taken that as your most recent character.
---
yes to get it once
---
I have been, thanks.
---
I have actually done this in a way already. I got my first character to 100% map because I started with a Mesmer main, realised I die way too much and switched to Necro/Scourge. But at that point Mesmer was like 90% map so I got that done. Then ofc with Necro mained I wanted everything unlocked as well. I began exactly as you suggested, working my way through the core zones unlocking everything *except* hearts.
---
Couldn't do it. My OCD kicked in hard and I had to get 100%. Doing 10 or 20 of 50 hearts in a row is most definitely the worst way to do this. I haven't yet played any LWS, I only just bought them with the recent sale. Will start to run through those with a friend next week, so wasn't aware of the hearts thing for currency you talked about on those maps.
---
I still like my idea for central Tyria hearts and PoF hearts though. Subsequent characters and/or subsequent play throughs require a diminishing amount of input down to 10% on the 5th and all following characters/play throughs.
---
Just make your own group 4Head
---
What a stupid thought process.
---
no idea how to use this program, however I assume I open it and then pick gw2-64.exe
---
Warning: At least one delay-load dependency module was not found.
---
Warning: At least one module has an unresolved import due to a missing export function in a delay-load dependent module.
---
I see yellow question markings near a couple of dll's so I will assume I'm suppose to download these and place them in the bin64 folder with the rest of the game dll's?
---
please confirm I'm not an idiot...
---
Really?  I did a quick search but didn't see anything.  Oh well, just downvote it then.
---
They wont, so you either get a refund or you wait, thats how it works. If you dont like it keep that in mind for you next purchase that it can maybe happen again.
---
They probably working on stuff thats higher up on their list, fixing a bug on something thats not gamebreaking has a pretty low priority.
---
Yeah, I joined the discords. It's a barren wasteland.
---
I'm thinking the simpler explanation for the lack of Bone Dragons is simply that "Dragon" became a bit of a trigger word in GW2. As soon as you bring them up, it leads to speculation that they're related to the elder dragons which would have too many implications in the story.
---
MO CM with scourge sounds fun.
---
Examining how a standard pug raid is set up, you'd normally have two sub squads of 5 people. A shame frame is when you break the sub squad(s) and have someone in their own sub squad. ie: a 55 comp becoming a 4411 would mean there's two people being shame framed.
---
No, they have never relied on the Living Story to be "expansion worthy", this is why they actually DID expansions.
---
More content for the update, obviously.
---
That's amazing really love the style and the colors, good job!
---
I feel bad that you can not appreciate art
---
Idk mate. Raid Academy is very active on NA. The big ones are publicized for reasons.
---
Who gives a fuck, it's not like you're paying for the art.
---
Only used if you're base rev or herald. Renegade shortbow is objectively better and even without that consideration, the amount of skills that rev has have a ranged aspect to them. You rarely if ever need to be true ranged.
---
My main issue with **repeatable hearts** is not that they are **repeatable**, but that they are **too hecking slow to repeat**.
---
Them being long is fine for the first completion, but their novelty wears off almost instantly, and thus repeating them becomes tedious almost instantly.
---
Solution? Make **all subsequent completions 50% faster**. Boom, solved! Having the vendor locked now isn't much of an issue anymore, but players are still incentivized to revisit and repopulate the old zones without direct buffs to rewards. Win-win!
---
I feel bad that your standards for "art" are this low.
---
Just a whole Saga of content that they are trying a new format for, Strike Missions that will allow groups to fight story bosses together, future updates to WvW and PvP that they are still working on, and probably new raids and fractals since they have made no indication of stopping those.
---
New elite specs would be nice though
---
That's generally the thing is Raids, or sPvP for that matter. It's the Dunning‚ÄìKruger Effect. Players who are incompetent lack the exact skills to give them insight into judging their own competence level.
---
These comments are very eye opening, I am now smart. I looked up abbreviations.
---
&gt; What a stupid thought process.
---
"I went to my office once. Now give me *all* the money."
---
That said if LW does have actual expac content in it then future players will be better off because they will only need to buy PoF and LW instead of also adding in another expac.
---
It looks like you can reskin a toold now, (or at least remove the uprade and put it on another tool) so wouldn't this be preferred? Which tools are fastest? Any idea? (I've never even thought of that as a factor)
---
Well if I cared for it have been a flow list I would have taken the time to format that way :)
---
Oh awesome thank you!
---
&gt;I need to grind out a fucking title above my name to prove im worthy enough. That's where I stopped, realizing being so late to the party I felt like all i would ever be able to do is log in to do my T4 fractal dailies. 
---
This is just false. People start learning the content at all different times. You just either need to present yourself with the opportunity to start or look for appropriate groups.

---
This was on LFG the other day for CM fractals. What stops you from doing the same or joining this group?
---
I stupid, I jump.
---
Being competitive and quitting after a few bad experiences, yeah right.
---
There's always joining a like-minded guild, that's how I got into raids and CMs
---
I think he's just mad cause he couldn't draw it and he hates how supportive the gw2 community is
---
I was talking about over all community, not strictly people who are already in the raid community. But also strictly raiding community needs new inflow of players, because otherwise it will shrinks over time. There are people who want to raid, but dont want to join a public training guild like Inn for example, because it is so un personal, it feels like taking a car driving lesson instead of trying how to drive a car with a friend, if this makes sense. 
---
For gold, I assume this because of the last Teapots ERP. The price pool was insane, something like 200k gold + 3k usd. But this didnt encourage more teams to join, not even all the raid selling guilds which i see on the LFG. They can buy infusions i guess, but it is just an visual upgrade, not even an QoL upgrade like legendary gear is. From my experience, people i played with and who also sell raids, are usually proud of being in this guild, it is like a status symbol; "yeah, he is in a selling guild". I also noticed a type of personality with this players, this is why i think it is mostly not about gold at all.
---
I don't hate hearts. Well, that's a tiny bit of a lie. I do hate *some* hearts. And I like repeatable content. There are things I do over and over in game that I enjoy. Metas, bounties etc. What I don't like is repeatable content that feels like it offers nothing. 
---
PoF hearts feel like that to me. They unlock vendors. If I want to sell junk or buy tools I have to complete a heart? That seems a little excessive to me. I just think there should be a better way of doing this is all, without allowing map currency to be farmed as was said about LWS maps (which I haven't yet played). As far as coreTyria and Crystal Desert though, something could be done. And I think it should be.
---
I am sure they will take your request and be able to push it to live patch in 10 days.
---
BabyRage
---
Quit then. LMAFUCKING-O
---
Everyone who plays raids, likes raids, myself included (Even if i think they are not good for the game)
---
It just feels that you are looking for someone to blame, good luck finding that SOB.
---
As mentioned below, yeah, the starving village with the infected crops (Arkjok Farmlands) has a bunch of Desert Herb Nodes clustered relatively close together. There's also four Flax nodes.
---
A few weeks ago i forgot i was in my exotic WvW gear that i use for healer scrap and ran a t2 with 0 AR and i only noticed because i switched back to power holo to do the next scale
---
I wouldn't trust meta battle on anything if I can help it. Empirical data and reading the numbers is enough to tell whether something can be a a healer or not. Chrono's healing output tops out at 3-4k at maximum and isn't nearly as controlled.
---
First time I have heard this, is there something to read up on?
---
Incorrect.
---
By posting work of any kind in the public domain you are inviting criticism as much as you are inviting praise. You are incredibly naive if you think baseless, low-effort praise is more valuable than targeted criticism. 
---
I have given the OP several indicators of areas that can be worked on, that's infinitely more useful to him than any of the couple word long praise posts that you see here. 
---
You're sitting there on your high horse but you're the one throwing insults around while pretending to be the shining knight. The only toxic one here is you.
---
Yeah I didn't see any opposition. Everyone was asking for them and barely anyone objected. Having more daily things to do is a good thing, its just players *hate* having to do the heart again to access the vendor.

Standard tempest is staff. I have a suspicion I'd like to confirm before I give you any credit to the claim of all those boons so if you don't mind providing your build that'd be great.
---
Id gladly appreciate some new elite specs, though im not done playing all the older ones yet. So im still fine in this aspect ^^
---
Juvenile.
---
I never made a profit at it. The cost of 1 gold vs what u get , on top of the 1250 UM cost vs 250 VM cost makes it substantially worse
---
Easiest way is to join a guild that does Fractals for new members. The way we used to do it in GAME was one or two experienced players would do T1 or T2 with 3-4 newer members. We'd get a couple new guildies and LFG to fill the squad (and recruit from that ;). We did the same thing for Dungeons and Raids and other stuff like Migraine and Story achievements. 
---
I'm sure there are Guilds that still do that type of thing. Life is so much easier if you take the time to find the right Guild for you, even if you're all about solo playing.
---
According to the digital magazine they just put out, it's not "just a prologue", in terms of content.  It appears to be a full-fledged living world chapter - with a variety of content that would have been great to show off teasers of.  A Charr Demolition Derby?  That would have been cool to see a glimpse of.  The Cave of the Khan-Ur?  That sounds like a shiny thing to pan around.  The Doomlore Shrine?  Yes, I'd like to see that. Aerial sniping from heli-platforms?  That sounds nifty...
---
I get that "they can't win" - but they left victories on the table that they had access to. (They're going to be giving us all that in two weeks - it has to be something they could have shot video of) - and at least some of the critiques of the event (and what I found dissatisfying about it) was the lack of any real previews of in-game anything.
---
We got a clip of an Episode 1 Strike Boss.  We got the animation that plays for build templates, and a contextless clip of a cutscene.   I don't recall anything else from in the upcoming game content.  Cool trailers, nice interviews, great retrospective video - but no details on anything. No UI for the build templates, and nothing about the content of the Prologue other than it was going to be a big Charr party.
---
The event left me with the distinct impression that the Prologue was going to be just a party - and I should be tailoring my expectations for "real" Saga content to be happening in Episode 1 and beyond.  I'm delighted that turns out not to be the case, but I cannot fathom why they did it this way.
---
I wasn't expecting info on stuff that wasn't going to come for months and months to come, but they didn't show hardly anything of a lot of great things that we're getting in a couple weeks - and it wasn't to make it a surprise, because there it all is in the magazine they published, and that wasn't just slapped together in a hurry.
---
If you're going to tease a video event for 48 hours and rent a theater to show off your game, I wish they'd shown video of more of the stuff they had to show, and not decided to put a couple still pics of in an (admittedly fun) digital magazine instead.
---
That's one of the things that have been .....making the game a lot more boring. Hearts that have been slower...Fractals have been slower....Everything have been slower. Instead of making let's say, people play for a longer period of time, they have been stopping completely. Too bad this is not much of an option with hearts, I do want the map currencies.................  
---
Actually....What I don't understan is....hearts like the motivational one from Thunderhead peaks are just fun, and fine, and fast...so they are not extinct. But the grindy ones...the ones that makes you kill mobs....goddamit, looks like it was 15 mobs in core tyria to 50 in some S3 or S4 maps. Worse, mobs like some awakeneds or the white mantle are even less fun to fight.   
---
And goddammit don't make me start on Rytlock's heart in Kourna, that shit TAKES SO MUCH TIME, TWICE OR THREE TIMES WORSE THAN THE ONES WE ARE ALREADY CRITICIZING! AAAAAAAAH
---
Can we please do map wide meta events that sprawl over and effect each other again? That was the best part about Hot and is why those maps are still endlessly fun and repeatable. Just get rid of the friggin hearts! They're awful!
---
Drawing takes a hell of a lot more effort than it takes to bitch about it.
---
h-how dare you disrespect the vigils?? Best dad there.
---
'Stuck in a room with one bed' is a long time favourite of shameless fanfic authors, regardless of how ridiculous or implausible the situation is. It's right up there with 'having to pretend to date, leading to real emotions'. Fanfics really do love using the same romcom tropes over and over.
---
dragonfall did it right, complete 10 events and the merchant dudes stay open for u
---
People keep asking for repeatable content. And the reward structure for hearts has been really good since season 3. And it's not like you have to do them if you don't want to, after doing them once. Is your problem really the hearts or would you like the rewards they now offer be moved to another element, in that case: what element would that be?
---
I wish they could just disable the reaping glyph while in instances (i.e. home instance) that way those that harvest flax, wood and other stuff aren't affected.
---
Oh okay. Yep its definitely too late when added in the following episodes.Looks like many people already had enough of that ;(
---
Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
---
"more valuable" to what? Why does someone who just draws as a hobby need to be a perfect artist? What's it to you?
---
Get over yourself.
---
I have no idea what it costed since I had all of the mats it asked for. Still that sounds on par or slightly cheaper than any other 400-500 crafting expense.
---
She didnt ask for criticism. It was a light hearted post about her drawing her character in a game. Of all the things you could have done you chose to go the negative nitpicky route. Are we in an art class critique right now? No.
---
Love. Love is the greatest weapon.
---
I'm an arrogant twat for saying "This is a forum where you can post your opinions."
---
A statement that YOU also believe in, so what does that make you?
---
tempest gives good boons though
---
and you never have to take 2nd heal during your fullclear, ppl can just run slb power/condi for the spirit if they want to
---
of course you can minmax every boss with different, super specific comp, but for general in-one-go fullclears tempest gets it done
---
Incorrect, again. 
---
This person clearly spends a lot of time drawing. I am not a fan of this drawing, but i can see the effort put in. She has decent use of colour, the shadows remind me of the kind of thing i used to draw when i was in that awkward phase of knowing enough to kind of know mostly what to do, but not having the ability to really pull it off, so i can see the effort and the time spent. 
---
A person who has put this much effort into her art clearly wants to improve, and is clearly working to better her ability. The only one in the wrong here is you for white-knighting to a strangers defence and making assumptions based on nothing. Based on my knowledge of art, this person is not someone who has no desire to improve, and again you are being insulting and dismissive of her to assume she is like this. 
---
Your last comment has made it clear that you lack the ability to see the effort behind this art, and are assuming the motivations of someone you don't know. And your assumptions spin her in a negative light.
---
Notice how I said "twats" aka not just talking about you.
---
Claw-r Island as Trahearne would call it
---
What do you mean? Sirens Landing hearts are fun and not tedious to do. It is a pretty goo way to farm pearls for ascended trinkets or back items, given that you are a seasoned player that gathers tons of karma.
---
S1 was meant to be an alternate to expansions. 
---
After it they realized expansions would work better to pull players back into the game, so they rushed to do HoT while releasing S2.
---
And? What fucking relevance does that have?
---
I am a separate person, You called me a twat for the reasoning I listed above - Despite the fact you also believe in what I posted.
---
When the moderators decided to allow tens of art posts daily on this supposedly game related sub. Take it up with them, i guess.
---
Thanks for the long summary! Any chance you can provide the PVE tank build? Just made an engineer this week and I like hammers
---
reward tracks were the best way for me by far
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm a Herald.  Main set is sword/sword, and my skills have decent range, but auto attack will always be the primary source of dps.  Hammer has 1200 range, and rev has other problems like bad sustain and mediocre AoE.  Hammer is just a better choice a lot of the time.
---
I'm making assumptions? Yet you sure do infer a lot about a complete stranger's life to decide what is "best" for them, whether they want it or not. 
---
I didn't "assume" your motivation, you literally fuckin said "blind upvoting of dross like this on this sub is laughable." That's not useful critique, that's just bitching.
---
that depends on your phase time, i guess if it's 20sec+ you can surely go condi fb.
---
i personally wouldnt want a condi fb in a static but it's way better when pugging because you can unwind the dmg (im even collecting gear for it right now)
---
I remember when people were disappointed hearts came back at all.
---
Repeatable hearts are a grind not the kind of repeatable content people want.
---
Pay a group to grind fractals for you, and then buy them with relics
---
It's even used rarely in fractals when CC is enough and you need more cleave
---
It's not "against my argument." The fact that everyone can have their own opinions is just a worthless argument, because that statement applies to everyone, including people who disagree with another's opinion and/or the way they expressed it.
---
Just because you can do/say something doesn't mean you should.
---
I already said i don't care about the artist or art posts in general, and don't pretend you do either. But i took the time to give pointers on areas of weakness anyway. Trying to make me seem disingenuous only works if i actually tried to pretend i did care.
---
In any case, you clearly lack basic understanding of the written word, so i'll leave it here. We've been at this for a while, your white knight robes are probably getting a bit grubby, so maybe take the time to throw them in the wash. I heard a bit of bleach in the machine really makes those whites pop.
---
Thanks OP
---
People asked for repeatable hearts. That means the ability to repeat. There is no implications about it being required.
---
Are we still talking GW2, or politics now?
---
&gt; So let's say you bought some chips for $5 at the store. The next day you go back to the store you see them on sale for $2.50. 
---
The chips are physical items, presumably of limited quantity. You also chose a bad example, as chips are not only physical, but consumable. Let's say I bought any electronics device (barring sex toys only, I believe?) where I live, Spain. If within the next 14 days I hear it will go on sale anywhere else, or even the same store, I'm well within my right to return the device and get a new one at the discounted price. Mediamarkt, where I get most of the stuff I want to hold in my hands before just buying, handles this by offering me to just give me the price difference between my paid price and the sales price, to not go through the hassle of handling a returned item.
---
&gt;Would you ask for a $2.50 refund or store credit?
---
So yes, I would ask for a refund, and in 99% of physical stores, they are legally obligated to give me my ***money*** back, not in-store currency. Also, another company (specifically Riot), has already agreed several times over the 10 years i've been their customer to refund me the price difference. Also, this company's subreddit has several posts of people in similiar situations that also get refunded.
---
&gt;If you didn't think it was a fair deal you wouldn't have bought it in the first place.
---
Luckily, you are not in charge of customer relations. I know for certain I'd be much more conservative with skin purchases in League of Legends if they didn't refund purchases around the sale date. If Anet does refuse a refund for a purchase made ~17h before the sales announcement, I'm 100% never buying anything that's not already on sale, or just newly released.
---
again, theres a time and place for critique.
---
The closest would be spending um/vm/bandit crests + gold. I would recommend UM out of those.
---
That is somewhat annoying. I have more than I can use on one but ended up having to buy more on my main. :/
---
I've seen pvp fights between Ele and Mesmer and Ele just seem a lot more fun with a lot more options. Mesmer look as if they have less skills and are just teleportation, and if you're against someone a good eye you don't stand much chance. 
---
I don't see a mesmer beating a good thief, but an ele has a chance.
---
the only real cool looking fighting styles I've seen are the reaper of necro and the melee ele where he spins around and shit. never seen anything cool in the mesmer, if you can link me something to see that would be great.
---
Thanks so much for adding this. Very new to healing
---
 and appreciate insights.

---
so ye, thanks. basically I have no reason to buy an expansion. I already have the base game paid because I bought it a few years back, it's not a trial version so no restrictions for me.
---
No mmo can give me the same experience that Tangled Depths gave me when I ran into a pack of vampire murdering assholes
---
I have couple issues with that build consideration and that is time. The amount of time you'd spend outside of water doing earth and fire overloads leaves you in a weaker spot heal wise without Elemental Bastion so you're immediately basically already forced to take that trait. 
---
I don't think it's worth considering Fire over Air then as the matter of Swiftness is usually less important and instead what matters for fury isn't your allies when you're in that consideration but yourself when you're considering Heat Sync. I think going with Fire traitline opens you up to some other interesting things. It lets you do some cute things for warriors like taking Powerful Aura and giving condi zerkers more auras to explode, t gives you additional cleanses with Smothering Aura's, reduces CD of fire's skills so that Heat Sync's might upkeep is not as strained and Persisting Flames causes Wildfire to last long enough such that if you were to cast it last before swapping to earth, you can get Overload Earth's blast finisher to proc on the fire field as well. I think the value of Fire's traits outweight the value of the zephyr's boon.
---
Swiftness is still technically manageable to be permanent swiftness by doing a quick air cyclone if you were that desperate.
---
&gt;Actually raid selling is very bad for the community. Not only in games, but generally in life there is always a process where more capable and experienced players or people in general pass their knowledge to noobs or those who are not capable for any reason.
---
That's fair enough. It's a good point against selling raids. However it doesn't make my point any less significant. It's just pros vs cons, I'm sure if we racked our brains we could come up with a 100 other factors that need to be taken into account in order to look at it objectively. /u/Evolution_Of_War and you yourself added to that list below. My gut feeling is that raid selling is a good thing, but you're right in that there are definite drawbacks to it. Maybe it was misingenous to use one positive aspect of raid selling to generalize the overall impact it has on the game, but it's just as misingenous to do the same with a negative impact of raid selling as you did. I'll edit my comment accordingly. The only true metric are the player statistics that ANet has.
---
-
---
&gt;It is in interest of all players, that average skill level is high as possible. Same goes for life, imagine everyone in a country is well educated and generally knows about stuff. There would be no brexit referendum vote for example, there would be no manipulation via political campaigns, because everyone would be too smart to buy into it. 
---
I appreciate you trying to bring politics into this is, but it's really an unfair comparison lol. To address Brexit, the most common counterpoint is that 50% of the population is of under average intelligence, and they shouldn't be the ones making such decisions. This could apply to raid selling, but it really is an unequal comparison.
---
&gt;If everyone on the server would be very skilled, almost everyone would pug and time which is currently wasted by waiting for group to form would be basically zero. Every pug group would just speed clear the raids and we would all have a good time.
---
GW2 is never going to be a raid focused game by design, that's just the reality. The best we can hope for is that it becomes one of the core pillars along with open world exploration, story, PvP, and WvW. It's very different from other MMOPRGS that expressly funnels players into raiding. There's a huge percentage of the population that only interacts with one of those pillars. Now, I do think that interaction between these components should be further incentified, but it'll never reach the point where everybody interacts with raids.
---
&gt;There is another thing at raid sellers. This people dont sell raids because they like the content. It is also not about the gold, because in this game after you reach a certain point, gold wont have an impact on your experience at all. They sell it for that confirmation, that they are good at something, obviously they have a lack of confirmation in RL, because they probably suck af.
---
That's...just a misingenous blanket statement.
---
As I said above, you're right in that it's not cut and dried as I made the it out to be. However, no matter whether it's good or bad, OP didn't deserve the hate he got.
---
&gt;It's not "against my argument."
---
I mean it clearly is, You're saying a public forum is not the best place to post your feedback and opinions and that he shouldn't have said it.
---
Artists do not grow without feedback, sometimes you might think something looks right but it doesn't.
---
Now, If you post your Art on a public forum you are aware that random people will be commenting on your work.
---
What they choose to do with that feedback is entirely up to them but saying "You shouldn't say it because it's mean!!" is fucking stupid. 
---
His first comment wasn't even bad - It was strictly related to the art and not the person and yet the first response he got was someone attacking him - Classy.
---
&gt;Just because you can do/say something doesn't mean you should.
---
There is no purpose to posting art on a public forum if you don't want people to post their opinion on the art.
---
That's literally all the entire comment section is - Opinions. Trying to police opinions to only be ones you agree with is dumb. :)
