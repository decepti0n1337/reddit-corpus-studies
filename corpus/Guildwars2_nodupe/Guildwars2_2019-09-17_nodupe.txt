It's not because not every group is like this. In fact, most groups arent like this. People usually leave before complaining. The bad ones are usually the loudest and that has nothing to do with raids, you can find those players everywhere.

---
---
Just wanted to point out some misinformation here, a set is not 1,400 mystic forge conversions. :P
---
I am not telling you to not play the game, I can only recommend it. But if the rollerbeetle is to much to do for you, there is literally nothing with less effort in this game. It‚Äôs a really small and easy collection. If you like story that is great, and I personally think that even if you only like the story that is still reason enough to play Guild Wars 2.

---
Those mobs are like the old, naked guy in Life of Brian. So protective over their berry bushes!
---
I never knew just how horrifying the Snake Trap actually was. Holy fuck.
---
I think it's only a Ranger using Utility Skill: Viper's Nest. But each theyr own.
---
i meant cm fractals  because both suffer the "i dont have kp therefor i cant gain kp" paradox issue. i already have 51 li at this point so i can be accepted to most groups and it only took me 3 weeks, so i do agree its not as hard as people (including myself) make it seem to be. TIL.
---
Uhhhhh how about let us use tool belt skills after overheating that would be an ok start
---
&gt;It's fine to have some things that aren't a cake-walk
---

---
He didn't say it was hard.
---
my level 80 berries-slave thief can never thank those enough.
---
üëÄ so... actually I didn‚Äôt look too deeply into the beetle . Once I saw a series of collection quests I didn‚Äôt bother to read much further. I understand why it has to be this way, because of the time it takes to create story content. But I just don‚Äôt like it. 
---
I was also concerned when I read you would need max masteries for the future DLC content to get around ( not sure if this is true) . 
---
At any rate , have no fear. Once I‚Äôm able I‚Äôll be buying the next expansion and every one after that. GW2 is great memories üòé
---
It‚Äôs a new map but all I‚Äôve seen from teasers seem to be mini games....wonder if this something done by the festival teams maybe but it isn‚Äôt actually a festival.
---
At least we know there is some story regarding rytlock and his tribune
---
PvP bot?
---
&gt;At one point, the guys did say he wishes there was more time to explain things,
---
But also there were several points where they were like "we could say. . . but no, we won't."
---
&gt; If you were able to talk to these guys one on one and they didn't give you all the info they use, then I would probably agree with you.
---
They had plenty of time to go over more of the actual plan, that was never their intention. If they want to put out a second video, I'll watch that one too, but I'm not holding my breath.
---
In theory, given that prologues tend to be short by nature (but they could be longer than or as long as a chapter).
---
In practice, all we can say is that it won't be of the same nature of releases. Episodes 1 and 2 will share a single map, while Bound by Blood will have its own map.
---
The issue is that they rebranded Season 5 as "The Icebrood Saga" with a prologue and 1) Living World episodes never had a non-festival prologue before (the only prologue had before was Festival of the Four Winds 2014 acting as a prologue / teaser for Season 2 Episode 1, where it showcased Aerin joining the Zephyrites, and had proto-Dragon's Watch mention going west after the celebrations/fundraising). And 2) We don't know what the rebranding means, whether it's just a special name for Season 5 (e.g., how Season 1 is "Scarlet's War") or if they're changing the Season methodology, or Saga is more than a Season and will go beyond our current season.
---
Regarding the masteries they said the they will use certain mastery-bound mechanics into the new Living Story, like Gliding or Jumping Mushrooms or Mounts. But I doubt that you have to have masteries maxed. I think the basics, like the first few masteries of the mastery trees will be enough.
---
Except now it's just a "prologue" after 4 months.
---
Did they? I only remember them saying it was a prologue. When / where did they say it was a mini episode?
---
You might notice that nowhere did they actually claim you were active the exact second the ban was enforced. The GM was merely repeating the obvious: that your account was online when the action flagging it for a ban occurred, and that they won't provide information on when that was for security purposes.
---
Before I do a general reply to your comment let me just debunk a few things. First off the red and blue infusions are both Lucky drops but only the red one can be purchased from the vendor with essence.
---
second I did not say that this was a recurring thing or that this happens all the time. I'm just talkin about a problem that I have been dealing with for the past few months that have just bottled up. If I had to take a guess maybe about 526 * this is happened in this time frame. I have had plenty of successful groups but with ones requiring 100 essence or more I've been at a probably one success out of those groups. So 1/6.
---
Thirdly I never in my entire time learning fractals teaching fractals I've never blamed anyone else but myself. As toxic thinking that it's someone else's fault why you lost is just a horrible way of well... Thinking.
---
Fourth I never implied anyting. other than probably vagueness of what I wrote could be interpreted I never outright gave statistics.
---
I do appreciate what you said but a lot of what you're saying is just jumping platforms that I've never confirmed or said.
---
also I should know that I am driving right now so as far as reading completely what you wrote I could have misinterpreted things and I'm also using voice to text so hopefully I reply correctly
---
&gt; ...have an easier time of unlocking the griffon...
---
Well that‚Äôs great news ! Looking forward to the next pack. Maybe I‚Äôll grind for a week to get the ‚Äòscale. I grinded (ground?) for a week to get a weapon in Destiny 2 after all. ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Wow, that's even more underwhelming.
---
The amount of times someone left me to bleed out and die in Bitterfrost... That entire map's population is the antithesis of "the greatest community".
---
I played GW1 in its entirety before coming to GW2 back in 2012.
---
Secondly, I said,
---
&gt; words that come from GW1 **with no background or explanation to them**. 
---
There are no connections other than one usage words they place in the story dialogue.
---
Give one example of good story plot connection to GW1. If you believe it to be connected. I can give several examples of how it is not.
---
One example is Livia which is used in LS3 episode 6, they brought in a characer from GW1 with no background or context other than the hunt the last mursaat. Then she dies off. How is that meaningful connection to GW1? It is not.
---
Erm... the flaming sword(s) in ASOIAF existed way before season 8 of GOT.
---
But yeah, Guild Wars is nothing like GOT.
---
Erm what? I have a full set of harriers and have only gone to that bitch once.
---
Just stat switch whatever is cheapest.
---
RIP GW1 updates. Sad day for the original game and its community.
---
Yeah, but Anet is going to nerf him in PvE again.
---
"Oh but holo can do 34k dps now with sword/pistol" yeah, 34 without burst, cc, mobility, shitty range, etc etc.
---
And buff PvE'S DH, probly he's going to do 35k now with only basics (srry but looks like that they're trying to do that with DH) They only do that in PvE balancing patches.
---
Almost every single post you've every made was regarding being banned from various games. You're a serial cheater/botter. Don't run cheating/botting software on every game you play and maybe you won't get banned. Quit trying to nitpick the GMs about the exact day you were botting, just stop breaking the rules, Jesus Christ.
---
thanks =)
---
agreed.  
---
no setup, no suffering... just alt+f3 and done.
---
StephenCW is still around as far as I know and still has plans, so there may yet be more updates, but we'll have to see.
---
hahahahaha  
---
yeah, like a oil paint (artistic filter)  
---
but I like it... its different... its like a new game
---
100% true what you said.
---
I think they got scrapped because they would whirl and coil around themselves, and often clip through the floor.
---
Sometimes they looked more like paper streamers on wind tunnel than snakes.
---
Definitely nothing fishy about multiple devs in different departments leaving in a small timeframe, nope. Even considering the insinuation of ill tidings is such a tinfoil hat thing to do.
---
The OP raises an excellent question.  
---
As far as I am aware, they‚Äôve never bundled the Living World content with an expansion.  It‚Äôs always been a separate purchase.  I‚Äôve always suspected that this is intentional so that the Living World content becomes a ‚Äúhidden cost‚Äù to new players and an extra source of revenue for ANet.  
---
Essentially a new person would buy the base game + expansions bundled together only to realise later only they have to buy the Living World content which is separate purchase.  It‚Äôs not immediately obvious Living World content is a separate.  You don‚Äôt realise it until after you‚Äôve beaten the base game.  
---
In all honesty ANet need to move away from the Living World business model.  It‚Äôs a confusing business model that‚Äôs never achieved critical success.  Personally what I would recommend is bundling Seasons 2 and 3 with HOT and bundling Seasons 4 and 5 with PoF.  I‚Äôd also sell a Guild Wars 2 battle chest that basically contains every season/expansion plus some unbreakable gathering tools at no extra cost.
---
Your first sentence kinda contradicts your second.
---
PoF came out 2 years ago. Those of us that paid 250g have had plenty of time with it, I'd be happy for it to drop to 150g or even 100g.
---
Hey man at least we're getting these story content drops at a steady 4 month release cadence. It's a weird feeling to end the year with a Prologue and then have the first chapter in the next year.
---
I grinded out skyscale but I cannot justify 250g on griffon, So I haven't bothered with it.
---
[removed]
---
&gt; Earning the gold required is part of the difficulty.
---
No it's not, It's just autopilot RIBA or Dragonfall. Most people already have the gold.
---
It's closer to average of 4 months at this point.
---
&gt; blast through the whole thing in one evening
---
It's a prologue, it'll be like 2 hours of content max.
---
Make it a log in reward.
---
&gt; and time investment is negligible
---
It's actually not. Sure one Iron Bar is crafted in no time, but 1000 take a while. And it's not only the crafting and not only Iron Bars.
---
I would say Iron Ores/Bars are most used for Deldrimor Steel. Most people don't craft the full bar every day, they craft the Lump of Mithrillium (the one with daily cap), gather them for a while and craft all Deldrimor Steel Ingots every two weeks or whatever. 
---
Last time I crafted Deldrimor Steel Ingots I gathered 50 Lumps of Mithrillium. That means 50*20 = 1000 Iron bars + 50*10 = 500 Steel bars. There are two things now.
---
1.) Crafting time. Crafting 1000 Iron bars take a while, same for 500 Steel bars. Sure it's "just waiting", but it's still annoying. And that's not it of course. There are also 1000 Darksteel bars to craft. And of course people don't only craft Deldrimor Steel, depending on their craftmanships they craft Damask Bolts, Elonian Squares and Spiritwood Planks too. And *all* of their ingredients (wood, fabric, leather) takes way longer to craft than ingots. 
---
Sure it's not the Iron anymore, but it all sums up and the result is that it takes *much* longer, if you craft all bars by yourself. And of course there are lazy people who buy Iron Bars (they are the most needed mats of all btw) instead of crafting them. 
---
So yes, the crafting time *is* a relevant point.
---
2.) Buy time. Most players don't have thousands of Iron Ores in their bank. If they craft Deldrimor Steels etc. it's pretty common to buy the needed T2, 3 and 4 mats.
---
Thing with Iron is, that you not only need 3 Ores for 1 Bar, you also need them for Iron Bars *And* Steel Bars. Like I said before, it's the most needed mat for T7 mats. 
---
Now, in my example I had 50 Deldrimor Steels to craft, that's 1500 Bars (Iron and Steel), that's 4500 Iron Ores. And that amount of Iron Ore takes pretty long to buy. And because it's so much and it takes so long to get enough selling players, you also get even more players who overbid you, so it takes even longer to get all your Iron Ore. Plus it's pretty annoying to overbid someone if you want to buy 4500 Ores -&gt; 18 stacks. If someone start buying actively too and has less Ores to buy, it's a lost fight. You have to wait until he bought all his Ores.
---
Buying Ingots on the other hand saves you the crafting time and, since you only need 1/3 and two different Bars, it's way faster to buy. Result: Time plays a big role here too.
---
And last but not least, your arguments doesn't count for my second example, the Bolts of Damask. Since it's timegated the time *do* increase the price here.
---
????
---
Season 2 is a thing
---
gw2efficiency.com - only those who sign up to it are listed. There could be many more players who are even more rich than 1.5 million who aren't signed up. ha, well a few. :D
---
Common solutions I see to problems like this are: Make your own groups, ask friends/guildies, if you have no friends/guildies go shopping for a new guild that does the content you want without as strict restrictions.
---
And especially to a game version that doesn‚Äôt have any flying mounts either...
---
If I don't die and give up early then how would I have the time to find different synonyms of trash and flame my teammates? /s
---
Why is this NSFW tho
---
&gt; One thing I really liked hearing more about though was the development of a community, specifically a guild, focused on trading and using the guild bank to get around some of the TP tax. It‚Äôs a workaround to improve profitability for multiple parties, but does require a lot of trust. That they‚Äôve developed such a community is pretty interesting.
---
It harms the rest of us when people get around the TP tax. It makes sense, to some extent, with items that are valued above the gold limit (high end infusions) but these people are basically cutting everyone else off at the knees when selling a legendary weapon. Legendary weapons do sell if you list them, but sometimes it takes months.
---
By skipping the TP tax, they are taking buyers out of the market for legit tax playing players and denying a sale to someone else who ends up getting less gold. The TP tax is also fundamentally important for removing gold from the economy and the most important group of people to remove gold from are the exact kinds of people who are exploiting this kind of scheme.
---
There are people who do their daily for the two gold it provides. There are people who get a lot of their gold from their log-in Mystic Coins. Those people are harmed by the richest players contributing to inflation by avoiding the TP tax. When rich players don't pay the TP tax, that's literally hundreds and thousands of gold that is no longer being removed from the economy. That cripples the TP's ability to combat inflation and it means the ordinary player that relies on very meager amounts of gold will be less able to purchase things, while the richest players build more and more wealth.
---
This reminds of one of the money making guides a Black Desert Online player came out with to "help" others in the community make money. He encouraged players to farm tonnes of wood (a resource each account has a limited amount it can individually farm, so they rely on others to sell theirs) and then list it on the marketplace. The profits existed but were pretty small for the amount of time invested. Meanwhile, his account was purchasing all the wood, turning it into a crate which could then be sold to NPC for a much larger profit. His guide to "help" other players was basically a scheme to outsource the labor and pocket all the profits while buying dirt cheap wood because of the massive supply.
---
The game would be much healthier if TP tax avoidance was a bannable offense. Getting other players to click away upgrading their mats is fine, if you wanna waste your limited time in game (or on earth for that matter) making peanuts in game, your choice. But dodging the TP tax, especially for high end trades - which are vital for the gold economy to combat inflation - we all lose when players do that.
---
Removing Viper‚Äôs Nest from my Soulbeast‚Äôs utility bar, thanks.
---
250 gold price is fine, though for most players who haven‚Äôt gotten the Skyscale yet or haven‚Äôt unlocked all of living world seasons 3 and 4 from the gem store, I recommend going for those first. Griffon can wait.
---
Thank you for the data. Seems to support the going price for the bags right now, since the margins from opening them are so slim.
---
I would set it to change after the player finishes the prologue mission. :) just to mess with the minds of players and incite a bit of "oh cool" hype
---
[And thats just the ones with the same title...](https://puu.sh/Ei4DE/5f52cb2cf0.png)
---
There are 3 others every week with a different title... do we really need the same screenshot a million times on this sub?
---
I just want better customer service / accurate suspensions. I wasn't playing for a week prior leading to the suspension if they'd just look at it they would see that. Instead of just providing me with pretty well-premade responses.
---
Just wish we could freely switch between them. Or have it tied to the region you last logged out from (core, hot+s3, pof+s4)
---
Cannot choose between mesmer and thief for the life of me. I have leveled both to 50 still like both evenly. My brother and cousin have started playing so I need to choose before they leave me behind. 
---
As a novice to GW2 which class would be the easier to learn PVP and raids with? Which is easier to get a spot for the two? My brother is also playing a mesmer so I kinda dont want to compete with him when getting into raids or other groups.
---
That methods seems pretty clear from what they are saying.
---
I think the most annoying thing was the come and go. Like the part on the medecin, scales and eggs should all be done at the same time.  And it should directly go to raising skyscale with 8 meats (2days), troublesome skyscale and skyscales riding.
---
Saving skyscale was absolutly unnecessary.
---
Bannable but not detectable if done right and not left on for days at a time.
---
tell that to the dude on my team who afks after he dies mid twice :/
---
&gt;against mobs
---
Well mesmer as a whole isn't great dealing with mobs.
---
Maybe if you switch to a Condi build you'll be able to do hit and run tactics. Or switch to Chrono and use its assortment of wells for AoE damage
---
I'm not a mesmer main so these are just off the top of my head.
---
Honestly I'm just never going to get one. I don't play much at all and it's way too much of a grind. Disappointing they made such an unfun/grindy collection for this. Griffon was a little tedious but still fun at least!
---
Where is this. What's so special about these mobs.
---
What 3rd party softwares you have?
---
&gt; Human gods used in one episode and one instance then killed off.
---
Never played the personal story, huh? or even PoF...
---
&gt; Elder Dragons were a shadow in GW1 and very minuscule.
---
If you call the whole Eye of the North expansion "very minuscule"...
---
&gt; Whole charr, norn, asura, and human story? What story are you talking about?
---
The personal story and everything these races are involved, which is like everything. 
---
&gt; Maps and npc types are not story.
---
They are including story, much story. 
---
&gt; Bloodstones mentioned in one episode, but neither explained nor shown.
---
WTF!?!?!! [Are you](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Bloodstone) fcking [serious?!?!](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bloodstone)
---
Ok, either you never played GW2 nor GW1 or you are just a big troll.
---
You don't know base things from both games, but trying to argue with "no connection". You definitely have no idea of the games (or trolling). In both cases there is no point to discuss with you, so please play the game / just leave this sub and troll elsewhere but stop talking such bullsht here. Thanks, good bye.
---
ESET antivirus Malwarebytes Spotify Skype Discord to name a few.
---
Jezus talk about being an absolute fucking  karen
---
I agree with you, dude. They made her into a shiny-grass type pokemon. LOL
---
They started out as a compromised account then said nope not compromised...
---
With the api being what it is it doesn't require a lot to get stsrted in making money in gw2. Grind up 1k-2k gold and then do some safe researched crafting and don't go for the high reward low trade volume goods. 
---
The more gold you have and the better organised you get the quicker you can make gold. A 600gp investment can turn into a 200gp profit after around 30min of clicking (after trade taxes) and grow exponentially from there. 
---
It is just boring as sinnnnnn, and not overly worth the time past a certain point. (I stopped after realising I was just doing it for collecting crap from the bltp that I never really cared about)
---
Oh good point. I forgot to include my runes and sigils. I am using energy and then force and scholar runes
---
My guess is producing and salvaging rares?
---
 Ha ha yeah, there are definitely more MMO antics I could explore and have fun with. Maybe I will revisit this idea with a part 2 or maybe even a mini series out of it. Cheers
---
So the main point of using your currencies and making something out of your basic materials is still pretty good to keep in mind. Very interesting video
---
Smashes table, "THANK YOU!"

Here's the chat code for 250 Unstable Cosmic essences -&gt; [&amp;AvpPPwEA]

---
It's not an economy lecture, it's a scam to get people to trade their time and account bound mats for a pittance while the people talking about it make a fortune off of buying the now increased supply of resources, which are worth less because of all the gullible people selling it to them.
---
If it was worth turning spirit shards into gold this way, these people would be doing it themselves. They only want other people to do what they aren't willing to do themselves.
---
I like how I am providing an intelligent counter argument, and you call me troll. How very troll-like of you.
---
Oh yea and of those two paragraphs of bloodstone wiki data, the one paragraph contains a small event in orr from classic GW2 just there for loose end purposes, and one is from LS3 which has absolutely no connection. This shows that the connection is even smaller than I professed in my last statement.
---
Ohhhhhh that may be it
---
These little rubber hose goobers were the highlight of the Beta tests for me so I was *ecstatic* when I ran into one in Desert Highlands. Now if only we could get the removed minipet!
---
I'm sorry, but the Norn have never been depicted that way as a race entirely. In GW2 we simply saw much more of their culture, from the bars and parties to the serious and adventuring.
---
Yeah but it's an important distinction to make, especially when talking about easily obtainable ascended gear for newer people. Not saying it makes it substantially harder. Just that it's potentially a very important detail for a newer player.
---
Here's a thing to ponder, how many times do we hear about devs leaving or joining companies in general? People swap jobs all the time.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Sure, it may not be tin-foil hat, but it's quite amusing when the publicly released information says GW2 has been doing well financially, but everybody continues to insist that the game is on the verge of total death and people should panic and despair.
---
Still trying to trigger with that bloodstone thing, you are a very sad troll. 
---
I won't continue your stupid game, you are blocked now. ~goodbye forever.
---
How do I kms irl?
---
you don't know what MLM is
---
You can actually get both the red infusion as well as the tonic as drops.
---
You guys obviously don't run CMs enough ;)
---
Glad to hear you are enjoying Tyria. 
---
You should be perfectly fine. As long as you log in during the times when a new story mission is released it will record it so that it will be automatically unlocked as soon as you purchase the necessary expansions.
---
Five at an elevated altitude.
---
Tonic for the Chaos Combat Tonic absolutely does not.
---
Your thinking the Endless Fractal Tonic.
---
Please don't lie about what you have done.
---
I don't know how long you've been playing yet, but I think there is enough to do in the core game for the next 1,5 months. If you aren't lvl 80 yet, there is definitely enough to do for you.
---
And since you unlock new LS episode by being online, you won't miss any new episode, even if you don't buy PoF right now. 
---
The bundle is a permanent change, there is no time limit. If you buy PoF, you always will get HoT for free.
---
He didn't even do anything like that. The fuck's wrong with you? How was he being a cunt?
---
Hate to be that guy, but do they expect those to actually survive? I mean, I don't know anything of releasing animals into the wild, but the the fact that they don't seem pissed off and trying to bite him tells me they are way too passive and won't know how or even try to fend off a predator.
---
People aren't concerned it will careen into an abyss tomorrow, or that the game is actually dying - they are concerned that the loss of old guard talent and skill will reduce the quality and quantity of updates going forward.
---
There's really no feasible way to have multiple, long-term projects with no announcements or anything releasable for years while the only thing your company actually profits from is left to wither *without* poor management. Old guard leaving in quick succession isn't a guaranteed sign that management is still bad or worsening, but it's basically *never* a sign that management is doing a good job.
---
People are worried that decisions from incompetent management may shorten what could be a long and fun lifetime for the game. It wouldn't be the first time ANet's management squandered the potential that many players believe GW2 has, and it *could* be the first time their management actually takes the fall for their own incompetence - but it won't be.
---
What game mode?
---
Mesmer would be more wanted.  You could gear as both a chrono tank and dps mirage and take whatever role your brother doesn't want.
---
If I were the group lead...
---
tonic: yes
---
infusion: no
---
&gt; So you admit that many are leaving just not all?
---
Uh, yeah? Just like they've been leaving the franchise since 2005. People leave MMOs, especially one with an ethos that is so heavily tied around bwing easy to pick up and put down.
---
Game is still here. That's not a statement that there are no problems that need to be solved, but it is a statement that if they're solved after some people leave, more will be here afterwards to enjoy the improvements,
---
&gt; Dungeons are abandoned why? 5 man Dungeons were great leveling experiences, and they were great gold farms, then they were nerfed and completely unsupported in favor of other PvE content such as fractals and raids.
---
Dungeons were nerfed because they were easy content that was difficult to improve because of spaghetti code but also provided the best gold per hour that no other farming activity could touch. Their gold per hour has been improved via dungeon frequented achievement but no one does then because they're honestly not that fun compared to fractals and raids, and its a meme that they're dead and you don't get rewarded from them so no one thinks they're worth doing. Set up some groups, you'll still find new players doing them.
---
&gt; Raids are being abandoned why? Slow development and no road map. No entrance level raids. **Only a small portion of players even want to raid.** No in-game build templates. No fully supported dps meters.
---
That's why. The gane didn't even have raids until after Hot. I love raids, I love that they exist, I want more of them, but I know darn well that they're not a ggod ROI for Anet given how few people raid. GW has never been the place for hardcore raiders who do nothing else. GW1 got one "elite" area on average per expansion, and they weren't even that hard. I genuinely hope raiders get a roadmap, I really do. 
---
&gt; PvP is abandoned why? One game mode 7 years. PvP balance is terrible and slow. The meta builds usually contain one ore two professions out doing the rest. etc.
---
Eh, PvP meta has been pretty good over the years, with a reasonable spread of professions and roles. They need better automated tournament support, and more frequent small balance tweaks. I don't even think they really need a different format, but it's nice. Frankly GW2 PvP is healthier after 7 years than GW1's was so...
---
&gt; WvW is abandoned why? Poor coding. No developer support. No development. Mounts added to WvW completely wrecked roaming which was a huge portion of WvW.
---
This is the one that peeves me the most, because WvW should be GW2's secret sauce that sets it apart. It's just so good in principle, but frustrating in practice, and even still it's such a fun mode. I don't even mind mounts, running back to the fight was the worst part of the game. I really like the idea of rewarss being linked to how many people are defending and objective to incentivize defense and not karma training. We'll see what the next few months brings, but I agree they need to do something here.
---
AKA. you smash your face on your keyboard until you realize you wiped the entire enemy team.
---
&gt; But the potion YOU CAN NOT GET AS A DROP.
---
No, you can, I‚Äòve received it twice so far from my fractal runs.
---
In regard to the reason with your thread I think it‚Äòs just a glaring example of the Dunning-Krueger effect. No amount of KP can ever showcase the quality of a person‚Äòs runs through Shattered Observatory CM. I suppose the higher it is though the more likely it is that their runs have been smooth and fast enough without having them made quit the gamemode.
---
Either way, a group allowing you to tag along simply because you‚Äòre the support is absurd because your performance would be just as important to my group if not more so than a DPS player‚Äòs but the distinction already is irrelevant. You‚Äòre probably dealing with people who think to have hit the highest percentiles in performance when the most they‚Äòve done is check discretize.eu and called it a day. 
---
There‚Äòs honestly so many ways to optimizing your encounters that you get such smoother runs like carrying over the breakbar from Skorvald‚Äòs 66%-33% to 33% so he doesn‚Äòt do the knockbacks at all, putting down DH traps on the spawn points of the 75% Knight at MAMA and the splits at Siax, instant-breaking the bar of Ensolyss so you don‚Äòt get the dome at the start, skipping the first bomb at Artsariiv with mere damage or simply adjusting your skills so that the heavy hitters coincide with finished break bars to get the most out of the +50% modifier because your group values it enough to go out of their way to deal the most crowd control in the shortest amount of time. Of course they‚Äòre not mandatory for a succesful run but oh boy, are people skipping out on these things. Unfortunately it doesn‚Äòt stop there. People will forgo so many more things either out of laziness or ignorance. I still recall one twitch streamer playing chrono shrugging off his lacking pre-stack claiming a fight doesn‚Äòt have to begin a fight alacrity because all the big CDs have probably not kicked off yet which was infuriating. Bottom line is that it‚Äòs a slippery slope and people will slack off with so many things while dislocating their shoulder trying to pat themselves on the back.
---
Furthermore a good group should be capable of identifying a proper issue such as lack of CC such as trusting to not dodge MAMA‚Äòs first flame spin or running off at Ensolyss and having him teleport to the run off all the way in Narnia. If your groups truly went after the lowest KP person then it‚Äòs not a group worth being in. 
---
Oh, and never forget to ask the opener of the LFG for their KP. On two separate occasions I found out that a druid advertised for over 150 KP more than they had and at another time a Dragonhunter with enough KP was pushing his 50KP friend on a chrono who hasn‚Äòt played in a year.
---
Another one bites the dust.
---
Are you sure your not thinking of the endless Fractal Tonic 8 am talking about the chaos tonic combat tonic
---
Go collect the flowers from the urban fractal from the legendary collection and post those if they do not accept your potion. xDDD best KP ever xD
---
It absolutely can! Do not spread misinformation simply because you‚Äòre reading off of the wiki page.
---
Very wiggly danger noodles. They're kinda' cute actually, look at 'em all wrigglin' away all adorable like.
---
OAcR4ZaBymcXMmEAAAAAAAA
---
Does anyone get that?
---
Is it as complicated as skimpy male armor and good-looking Charr armor?
---
pve with casually pvping just for reward tracks
---
Honestly, I have been playing Borderlands 3 so I have not been on for a few days. It was still down last I played though.
---
Worst case scenario.  Prologue.  Halloween event.  Wintersday.  January episode 1.
---
&gt; The burden of proof is on you. I am not the one claiming how easy it is, you are. Now, about that video.
---
Actually, what I said was that *if you bothered to practise* - instead of fucking about on Reddit screeching people make videos - you would find that this griffon flying isn't as difficult as everybody is making it out to be. What I said was that the *camerawork* is the impressive, difficult part of this video, *not* the griffon flying. What I also said was that if you can achieve gold in the griffon Master/Expert activities, you *can* fly like this, *because those activities require you to fly like this* to generally get good enough times to hit gold.
---
Making a video still doesn't prove anything, you absolute layabout, because I've already *done* the practise. All my video would be is a video *exactly like the OPs*, without the camerawork.
---
Your claim is that it isn't easy, at all. Even if you practise. Your claim is, in fact, the far more outrageous claim to make. So go ahead. Make a video of you practising, and failing, and most importantly: of you *not getting better*.
---
Go ahead. I'll wait. Or, wait... will you continue to try and take my claims out of context, claim I said something that I didn't say and then demand I go make a video instead? ;)
---
there use to be an F key # ingame to redo the same mystic forge recipe again. now it seems to have been taken out of game :(
---
Any search on the internet will come up with not a single person mentioning getting the potion as a drop.
---
No matter what search you do on endless chaos combat tonic you'll get zero info. Do a search on red celestial infusion and posts about some people betting 2 drops no drops after x runs getting a blue instead. Nothing and no one ever says hey I got a potion out of the run. All these people running it that much and not one person mentioning in alllllllll these Reddit threads?
---
Count me skeptical thinking you may forgot you bought it. Or if you even have it to begin with.
---
Most countries have lots of legal tax evasion methods :p
---
i feel like CM pugs are nothing but pain until you get to the 250 mark tbh. people are stupid as shit even up to 100
---
And furthermore, these periods are like, minimum two months long so don‚Äôt sweat the login thing too much either.
---
:(
---
that's how stealthy we are. Even the griffons don't realize it.
---
Correlation does not imply causation.
---
Same for GW1 too...
---
It may just mean that it won't have a full story ark. I think some logic like that is why they aren't having a season as well. Because with a saga, there could be multiple at once, so we could have two separate stories going on between each other. Or Halloween could be a saga that gets an installment once a year.
---
Like lootboxes?
---
Oof, downvoted for an opinion regarding griffon not personally being worth 250g to me. Gw2 Reddit never ceases to amaze me.
---
How good is Istan these days? I stopped running it after the nerfs and I haven't checked in on it since.
---
Well, can she at least do a proper announcement that she will be on hiatus. I mean, her guides is written so thoroughly that it can be said that her guide was de facto guide for most GW2 contents. I miss dulfy.net.
---
I mean, he tried that and then noticed a drop of in views and a rise in complaints.
---
So you are just likely not a large enough demographic to appeal to in this regard. 
---
(I prefer text guides for instance, but video guides have become the norm online)
---
Why is this marked NSFW?
---
That build is meant for **zerg play**, where you don't really need survivability. It's focused on doing enough damage to groups of mobs that die quickly to get loot.  
---
If you want power greatsword I'd suggest to switch to power chrono or core mesmer tbh.  
---
Mirage shines with axes because you have so many dodges - axe 2, axe 3, jaunt and cloak(and staff for the same reason, but I only play axes so can't comment on staff). Also the chaos trait line adds A LOT of survivability, consider that instead of domi. Use dodge food! Bowl of Meat and Winter Vegetable Stew is cheap and super usefull in open world.
---
GW1 timeline: https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Timeline
---
GW2 timeline: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Timeline
---
:)
---
&gt;it doesn't cover
---
Yes, it does.
---
&gt;we can make inferences based on recent occurrences.
---
Correction, you are making insinuations based on your presupposition and further supported by various cognitive biases.
---
even a broken clock is right twice a day
---
Oh hell to the no\~
---
Those are very likely the most detailed timelines you will find, unless there's one lost to the forum archives. You can get lots more information by looking at specific wiki pages (like the one on Season 1) and just reading and clicking links, but that will only be about that portion of the story. I'm not entirely sure what use a super detailed timeline would be, anyway.
---
youll probably need that time to get to 80 anyway, there is basically no pre 80 content in the expansions as far as i know.
---
it was irony,everything from holo hitting for at least 5k,leap included XD
---
Lol, someone feels personally attacked.
---
Awesome, grats :) also yeah, Tempest is just a dm great Elite Spec but peeps wanna cream on Weaver all the time.
---
For PvE endgame purposes the only stat mixing that usually happen are 
---
* Assassin + Berserker because you need some addtional crit chance
---
* Berserker/Assassin + Diviner because you need boon duration on a power support build
---
* Viper + Sinister/Grieving because there is no point to take more Viper if you already capped your condi duration
---
* Harrier/Minstrel/Magi because you need boon duration on a healer support and sometimes a bit more survival
---
Again this is strictly for endgame purposes (Fractals and Raids mostly) but getting a few additional Marauder trinkets (or an Exotic Armor set) for when you feel you need the extra survival could definitively be useful in Open World.
---
For Open World you could take a look at some variations from [Metabattle Open World builds](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World/Soloing) or the recent (still in progress) Wooden Potato's [Builds for General PvE series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdxmChRD2epfS9j4gS8D-tdQbPAajODOv) (no Warrior build yet but you the first 2 videos are generic).
---
For more general survival advice you could try to focus a bit more on dodges, evade window of you skills (Greatsword 3 for example) and CC (can't get hit by an attack if it can't be casted :p).
---
If you have PoF I would recommend you to try and unlock the Spellbreaker as its survival is unmatched by the Berserker or the Core Warrior thanks mostly to the Full Counter (F2) that gives you some bonus block/evade and does CC (and refreshes your F1, and ...). A mix of  [this build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Spellbreaker_-_Dagger_Sun_and_Moon) and [that build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Spellbreaker_-_Strength_Greatsword) depending on your taste can be very nice. Note that Mending is an extremely powerful heal and condi cleanse with a ridiculously low CD of 12 seconds if you have Peak Performance.
---
I suppose. Frankly, dude, I've never heard or read anything about that. Other than people just being dicks because it's fun.
---
I do agree with you, also realise everyone has and can have different expectations
---
Ok, a mild annoyance. Doesn't really make her much of a good villain. She was just a cunt.
---
My buddy and I really want to get Skyscales, as he really loves dragons, but I‚Äôm a very casual player and he is brand new to the game, and we have no idea how to get enough materials and gold and whatnot even to get started. How should we go about this?
---
More video:  [https://imgur.com/gallery/9HjWt2J](https://imgur.com/gallery/9HjWt2J)
---
Oh definitely desperate for karma.
---
I see. Interesting.
---
And what about dailies?
---
Considering doing quick dailies such as gatherer, vista, big spender, perhaps a jp (often has mesmers porting), and events.
---
Maybe also add guild hall gathering nodes?
---
Having up to 3 different guilds with them having t3,2,1 gathering nodes gives you a nice bunch of mats in a fairly quick time.
---
Maybe also check if lower tier tools yield more valuable mats over all?
---
Game is incredibly welcoming + easy for newcomers in fact (and not in any salty way at all) that is pretty much what the devs cater to nowadays... (casual, newb-friendly) ....new blood in the game is always a good thing after all. So much QoL updates over years has made it good to pick up + understand... I still think there should be a break-bar + WvW tutorial though haha.
---
There is no gear treadmill. Exotics are cheap + easy to aquire the next step up is ascended which from what players tell each other is anything from 5-10% dmg increase. Long term goals could be anything from collecting all skins (that's why ppl jest 'fashion-wars' frequently), reaching the best you can be at pvp/wvw, getting your first legendary, reach lvl 80 + get max mastery lvl.... to name a few. There's honestly a tonne of stuff to do as a newcomer I'd recommend fight open-world mobs first to understand how combat works then move onto dungeons/fractals (group content) and if you're keen for challenging content raids exist. Both expacs are worth it but I can only speak for elite specs since they are meta for practically every game mode, including mounts + glider to get around way faster.
---
It's a great mmo being my all time favorite however I will always believe it *had the potential* to be even better... maybe even one of the best yet that was &amp; still is hindered by poor management/marketing &amp; other relevant issues voiced by many on both reddit + official forums over all the years etc.
---
Do not let that last bit dissuade you buddy, I am only telling you this as truth coz I've been playing the game for many years there has been much focus on pve + living story etc but not as much for other game modes.
---
TLDR: great game for newcomers + casuals lots of content good bang for buck incredibly easy to get into &amp; collect many things, can invest tonnes of play time into this game, good fun.
---
But that's 3 soon, 9 soon, 12 soon
---
&gt;Okay so, are you going to take everything I say out of context and attack it individually?
---
Take what out of context? You are taking separate events to which you have no context for, and grouping them out of nothing more than personal bias. That is precisely what I pointed out as being fallacious.
---
&gt;You basically just said what I said using more words and a r/ iamverysmart attitude. Personally, I feel like being on the other side of a conversation as you feels like tiptoeing through a minefield, why do you do this lol?
---
Uh, no. You might want to try again there champ, because that's not what I said at all. Unless you were critiquing yourself in advance that is.
---
Maybe a trip to r/iamverydumb for you is in order?
---
But that only happens when the population on a server is high enough that there are more instances open. In dredgehaunt this is not the case sadly :D
---
War is right besides holo with being busted.
---
The game has lot of content for new players but still I'd reccomend going somewhere else, ffxiv and wow/classic seem the best options atm. Gw2 hasn't delivered any meaningful content in years and doesn't plan to, if you are in for a long experience, it might not be the game for you
---
I am on EU, but after i came home from work yesterday i logged in and still was on the same map, so no luck for me i guess.. maybe today
---
I mean why not 2s 5c instead ;)
---
Why not, who cares if it's expensive
---
40‚Ç¨ for complete edition. Fourth Euros for Guild Wars: Prophecies, Factions and Nightfall, with Eye of the North and some additional stuff. Don't forget, these are full games with dozens of hours' worth of content. Back then I payed 40‚Ç¨ for each of them, separately.
---
Was pretty good, now it's really punishing to mess it up. However with the gm it happens to me almost never.
---
well, I don't like her voice, too. I go so far to mute the videos and rather read on Wiki, if I don't understand something just from the visuals. But I'm still very grateful for the existence of all these guides.
---
It's fine as it is. It can be done in 10 small 25 gold chunks so is manageable
---
If you see something missing in the timelines, the community will be extremely grateful if you could fill up the holes.
---
ez solution for everybody who think that hes GOOD in CMs. MAKE YOUR OWN PARTY AND ASK FOR 250 KP
---
Why bother grinding a 10yr old mmo unless there's a decent pvp scene?
---
The pvp in this game is 50% bots.
---
I have 3 goals:
---
* I have to earn back my gold (spent on Gems). It's 1150g for now.
---
* I want to get a Dungeoneer title. I have completed AC, CM, Arah, and +/- 50% of collection from each remaining dungeon.
---
* I want to finish Scribe. Current level: 272. I'm doing it with boosters (item booster +50% and guild enhancement +20%)
---
I have 5-6 hours per day.
---
Because I like to. I‚Äôm a guild wars enthusiast for years now and not interested in PvP at all
---
Because it‚Äôs not all about pvp?
---
And all of them are either super fit or a body builder.
---
Hey! Check builds for your class on metabattle.com to be more effective. Also look what ppl doing on map and follow. Lake Doric is part of achi for aurora trinket, so mostly ppl do this achievement there, or leaving world story ofc. And when you fully come back you will know what you miss and what you want to do... but keep in mind to have fun! Cheers!
---
Please learn how economy works before commenting on economy post next time. Thanks!
---
Bots aren't a good thing for a game.  If you need a bot in order to farm berries then you may want to work on your build.
---
Saves maybe 3 minutes. Clicking on a stack and open all at once, sell. :P
---
Major tip, while the Guild Wars 2 community is still generally helpful, the r/guildwars2 is the most toxic portion of it.
---
I always bring this up to one of my friends. Race Change is a huge money maker for every MMO yet Anet can't make it work here. I know the personal story is always brought up but to me that isn't good enough. Anet would probably want it to transition 1:1. If you're on park 14 of your story as a Human they want it to be part 14 of a norn. 
---
To me its a easy fix: Either have it reset your personal story upon use or only usable once the personal story is complete. A race change could be sold at 1000-1200 gems and once implemented it generates free revenue. There is no reason to not have it at this point.
---
To be honest, they wont ban person for long period of time for first offense.
---
It's not just the personal story, as certain achievements can be tied in as well. 
---
Achievements are also tied with rewards such as skins and currency, including laurels and gems.
---
It is absolutely ugly to untangle/reset it.
---
Or you may say: why don't they just use back-up data?
---
That is also a no. As data literally uses space, and space means maintenance and money, similar logic to bag expansion limited to only one character. 
---
Well, that's my point of view. 
---
TLDR: It's either ridiculously hard to untangle or just not profitable.
---
Wait so the audio clues aren't enough? /s
---
Oh god, you need to be really good with dodging using this build. If you mostly run solo do not ignore defence . When I run warr, for example, without defence - I at least wearing durability runes.
---
The full quote is "most people do not have nearly enough obsidian shards to do anything with".  That doesn't change what you said.  If most people do not have enough shards to do anything with, they are hurting for shards to do anything with.  The only misrepresentation happening here is that you think you have data on what "most people" have to prove your argument.
---
I would love to see their recent year sales figures on ls2 Nd ls3... because I really believe both are worth bundling into f2p and hot+pof respectively.
---
It is pretty insulting that ls2 would cost a new player more than hot+pof at this point... or ls3/4 for that matter. 
---
And if they are pushing the story angle... dropping into HoT or PoF without the buildup of the seasons before them... well... it isn't like the game makes a good impression with the core story, it isn't wise to be shooting themselves in the foot like this imo. Ls1 is still missing afterall.
---
Personal story is not the only problem, it's just the most named and biggest "pack" of problems. Racial skills and armors also are problems for example. 
---
What happens if you wear racial armor skins and change your race? Your char would end up in a horror of clipping bugs. Automatically unwear armors? That also mean you aren't able to wear your old anymore, because you only can change skins on the armor you wear. So you have to create a new char of your old race, wear the armor and change the skin. Souldbound armor? -&gt; No chance to change skin then, you need new armor now. Ascended/Legendary Armor? Gz, you not only have to create a new char of your old race (requires a free char slot. If you don't have -&gt; 800 gems), you also have to lvl up this char to lvl 80 only to be able to wear the armor and change the skin. Just for example of course. 
---
Hundreds of race based dialogs in the open world and story, HoT is replayable, what if you switch from Sylvari to Charr in mid of the story? And what happen if you replay the story and than continue with unplayed parts? Same with PoF and Human. What if your racial skill (Druid Sprit, Golems, Norn transformations) are active while changing races?
---
The personal story is only a part of the problem, your "easy fix" wouldn't fix the problem at all.
---
It happens. Bill is a senior/tech lead level engineer. Seattle has an enormous cost of living and the engineering field is highly competitive. Last I looked into it, Anet actually pays their software engineers below average. And by looked into it, I mean I began the interview loop but opted out because (1) the position was for a tools engineer and I wanted to do gameplay, and (2) I have a family to provide for and Anet salary was lower than other offers I had in hand.
---
The guy could just be at a position in life where he needs to make more, or do something different.
---
Consider we are also heading into new generation of PC and console hardware, so studios are going to be ramping up and thirsty for talent. If you are in the industry and want to work with new technology or new games, or are looking to bump your pay scale, then now is absolutely a good time explore what options are out there.
---
Havent seen this one yet. My goal is to get all dungeon skins. How would a max gear player go about this? (wondering about efficiency and the time sink here mostly)
---
&gt; with ~~dozens~~ hundreds of hours' worth of content
---
The red infusion can also be dropped actually. I know for sure cuz I had it drop last week lol.
---
i can see the value for people who dont want to craft legendary weapons, so they just get their 1000g (500g per map completion gift) and buy ascended stuff for multiple toons, i personally wouldn't do it but i'm sure there are people who have them and don't plan on using them that it helped.
---
I just gave in and remade the character. It's sad that I have to keep a char slot used up because I don't want to lose my oldest characters for their birthday presents but eh, if your okay with having a slot used up it's no issue.   
---
After a while I just started looking at my old main as a bank character, I keep all my extra ascendeds on her
---
honestly mirage is one of the best open-world specs, insane Regen and damage avoidance w/ dodges and clones. u can basically solo lots of stuff that u're not supposed to be soloing.
---
Because people have attachments to some of the devs and the studio just laid off half of its staff earlier this year with little to no warning (to the staff) and are now changing the way the game will be delivering content going forwards.
---
I mean there are pessimists but lets not pretend that everything is smooth sailing at anet. They wouldn't have had such a large restructure and announced cancelled projects otherwise.
---
Skyscales, rollout!
---
Main hand axe slb is almost as good as dagger/sword. The difference is less than 1k.
---
For spiritshards do meta events, they usually net you a lot of lvls, for clovers you can either do spvp to get them for free or use the gp you get running metas to fund your mystic forge lottery.
---
Hmmm it depends. Some progress is lost in this process like hero points or map completion. But I don‚Äôt know how far in OP is on his character
---
Nice guides, thanks!
---
Gotta try it, thanks! :-)
---
I think the problem was opening an after Heart quest reward screen and such. But toggle is easier,  yep :-)
---
It was probably a formality thing. Since he's no longer with ArenaNet he'd rather not keep his account that's tagged on the subreddits as a developer. I guess they could just de-tag him but /shrug
---
Interesting! :-)
---
dont make that mistake many to with chasing after legendarys and burn yourself out by brain afk farming 8 hours a day silverwaste...
---
joing community discords doing metas/openworld, since PoF gw2 turned to be a pretty lonely game for an mmo, so interacting with other players does a lot
---
Didn't know you can scroll to perform action, will try it!
---
One of the points was that *they* are out of spirit shards, so they can't make more legendaries or T6 conversions unless other people get involved. Without spirit shards, all those materials can't be turned into that profit. They do the service of preparing the stuff, you do the converting/crafting, profit is shared. 
---
Of course you will get best value from your spirit shards if you do everything yourself, after all, gathering materials requires just to normally play whatever you want in the game. So if you are capable to play long game, you can do whole process yourself and just craft legendary weapon without sharing profit with them. Then either sell it on TP, sell it on GW2Exchange without tax (or sell it to some friend directly). 
---
Normal person has overabundance of spirit shards they don't have use for, and those traders have overabundance of materials that need spirit shards, so if you join the operation, both of you can get partial value. But that partial value is still way more than if you just let it rot in your wallet not capable of using it. You can buy materials yourself, but that is either time extensive to fish low bids, or costs more money that is cut from your profit. At some point, you get more value if getting materials from them instead of TP, saving your time on it, while they are outsourcing crafting time to you. 
---
So ye, there is time involved, there is potential profit and potential loss involved, and depends on anyone how much time they want to spend on it, if even. No trade = you either have to construct whole product yourself, or you have worthless materials. Trade = both parties share profit so each one makes less than if doing everything alone, but you get supplied what you are missing and just craft stuff in few minutes.
---
It is as if going to supermarket instead of visiting the farm to get food directly from farmer, or growing food yourself. Supermarket gets part of profit, but also delivers it directly to your city and is open 24/7...
---
5 is CC only when your behind the target isn't it? and this won't happy often in Solo? Unless you set you pet first and reposition yourself?
---
each blsk are worth 15 to 30 gold depending on your usage, if you count ascended insignia and inscription crafting in even more.
---
For someone who thinks they don't need data to prove an argument, you surely are joking with your comment about my schooling.
---
Make a bank character out of it, so it still has some use beside birthday presents.
---
Only that GW2 is 7 years old not 10.
---
There's a reason most of the player base doesn't use their spirit shards even if it's technically a good way to make gold.  Repeated Mystic Forging is probably one of the most mind numbing activities you can do in the entire game.  No recipe list, no favourites list, no "repeat previous forge" option, nothing.  And the profit PER forge for the vast majority of stuff is so itty bitty that it only adds up once you have spent hours upon hours doing it.  And at that point, you genuinely would be better off just running some fractals, messing about in a map doing events, or poking a Choya to death and waiting for it to respawn.  That last one will likely be the weakest profit option, but it's at least entertaining to watch Choya explode as they die.
---
just delete your character and create a new one
---
again you forget context. it's almost as if a rare material does not need more than a few recipes monkaHmm
---
I am not max achievement level thing (295?) im like 33. And what is gp?
---
The problems of our time *thonk*
---
Can you elaborate on how do you calculate the cost of a GoE? The opportunity cost will vary greatly from player to player. It will be much greater for a raid seller or tp player than someone who just afks on LA.
---
So I guess to get a ballpark of 700g you must be estimating how much does an average player make per hour on gw2 (I've heard 10g-15g before) and also how long does it take them to do map completion on average.
---
The point is that they run out of their spirit shards, and one person has limited time to play and get more spirit shards (you get them by actively playing, so they are time limited). They can't do stuff with their materials without spirit shards. 
---
You can do all the conversions and crafting yourself and get full profit, but if you don't have materials, you can't get that profit at all...so getting materials from them opens you way to get to the profit, but you have to share part of it for their service of sitting on TP and fishing out materials and offering them on-demand.
---
Buying food in supermarket is also scam, you could go to farmer directly and get more value for same money. Or you could get your own farm to get even better value. But neither you have time to drive around farms, nor farmer has time to cater for every buyes individually. That's why supermarkets are there and actually do profit. Time is valuable asset and this operation is same in that regard.
---
Thanks
---
I own it, I was just asking so I don't why people marked me down lol. I just assumed that cos gw2 is now basically free then gw1 would be.
---
Yea, obsidian shards are so "rare" there's an entire wiki page with a huge list of 140 different loot boxes that contain them, not including the long vendor list.  /sarcasm  That all you got?  Still no actual data!  Context can't help you.
---
No. Log in before the patch hits (in 7 hours).
---
damn the new animation update of the prologue looks good
---
I think it is worth making a thread when one of the two gw1 devs leave.
---
&gt; you need a community of trustworthy players
---
assuming you are talking beyond /r/GW2Exchange  .. this is easier said than done..
---
&gt;because real enemies don't line up to be defeated.
---
Unless it's an old time kung-fu movie.

Ah crap that makes me wonder; using norn cultural skin on an ascended armor set, will I be able to use that set on a charr when I level him? Or will it just be a simple transmute to a different skin to make it good?
---
I am not speaking about him personally
---
Need to transmute it before you can use it.
---
In other words: full gw1 sold for more than full gw2 with all future updates. Pretty funny.
---
No one knows for sure but I'd guess probably not.
---
In other words, he was being helpful
---
thing is, you wont be able to harvest the nodes consecutive times with that glyph.
---
berry nodes have a chance at giving you multiple strikes, but only if you keep on harvesting the same node out of the pair of them. as soon as you start harvesting the other one (they come in two as you know) youll effectively ruined your chances of multiple strikes.
---
with reaper runes everything is just farmed at once and you can kiss those chances at multiple strikes goodbye :P
---
Not to mention there are still plenty of GW1 devs there who still love the game I'm sure give the chance and if they have the time maybe they will help Stephen. We need to remember though GW2 is the companies main priority which it should be but if some GW1 devs find the time to go and do something for GW1 they should.
---
Congrats
---
Wasn't the first update of season 1 also called prolog? I think its just a formality thing here.
---
Just gonna summarize the big picture of the topic for the folks who don't get along with economics.
---
Essentially, these guys have built themselves a capitalist corporation within the game. You farm the exp (spirit shards) or mats, then they buy them of from you to craft something with a bigger profit margin (legendaries). They say the middle class of the game has been disappearing from the game which they also state it is bad for the game because you know, a capitalist corporation is nothing without its middle class employees working for them. They cannot farm enough spirit shards and some various other materials on their own to support the current crafting rate they have. They need you to farm these for them so they can craft the bigger profit margin items at a much higher rate.
---
For the past year and a half, GW2 community has been losing a significant amount of its mid to older player base (middle class). That's why we are seeing this video. This corp is losing its work force, thus its profits. This video aims to teach the ways of the middle class to the more recent player base of the community so they can get their disappearing work force back. In addition, you could just sell all of your available spirit shards just one time and be done with it. But they keep talking about how much fun it is farm some of the available content or promise that the middle class is going to be the first class in the future throughout the entire video, so you can be more motivated towards farming and create a sustainable supply stream for them.
---
I may have pictured these guys as villains, but the whole system creates a win/win situation for both you and them. The equation might look something like 30% win for you and 70% win for them (just an illustration, not actual numbers), and some might say you are putting in 30% of the item value and they are putting in the 70%, that the equation is just, it all comes down to how much you value your time spent on farming the items you put in. And if you want to go for the bigger part of the equation, they also show you how.
---
It's a bit lower now (probably, didn't check VM value) but the [Skyscale cost](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/br3epw/skyscale_saddle/eoaaoy8/) is pretty close to the Griffon. Just doesn't feel like it because you're not spending liquid gold.
---
To add to the previous answer: You will need a norn lvl 80 with the same armor weight to transmute your ascended armor back to an "all races" skin. After that you can equip it with your charr.
---
&gt; not one single evidence behind it
---
To be fair, they‚Äôve announced that this is a expansion-like addition to the game and both of the previous expansions featured a different character screen and launcher. Balthazar has been dead since a whole season back and we‚Äôre approaching Jormags arc. If they did in fact not switch the character screen and launcher then ofcourse they should be critized for it? This has nothing to with hype like the annoucement and if people get annoyed at it then they have every right to be.
---
Not trolling, but what is the big deal with "finally"? because if i remember correctly i got it in 5 6 days or something.
---
It's time to post my bank yet again

So much useful info, thank you. I have a condi berserker warrior too and was wandering about optimisation my asc gear (for casual solo open world playing but I'm just a perfectionist)
---
Your left 5 skills are weapon skills. They are determined by the weapon(s) you are wielding. Try each possible combination out and see what works best for you. Your right 5 skills are unlocked through hero points. At max level you will have unlocked them all so don't be concerned about wrong choices.
---
Yeah that's what we all think...It really is the last hope.
---
Animations could use some work, tbh.
---
Always clear my mobs, they are so annoying and I hate them so I kill them with fury! Also hearts =).

Why?

210, Legion

Yes that I know, but it sounds like that he wants to skip to the part before playing it one time.
---
WARNING: TOO MUCH TEXT, READ SUBCOMMENT FOR MORE, SORRY :3 
---
TLDR; DH stuff, Firebrand stuff, compare your own golem logs to benchmark logs to get insight in what you are doing wrong. Last part is about defensive abilities.
---
First of all make sure you have the same gear and traits as listed on the snow crows website, including infusions. After that it is going to the golem and trying to understand why certain skills are used at a certain time. For this don't forget to give yourself the same buffs as used in the video! For DH for example you will notice that you will use your biggest hitting skills while you are tethered to the golem with your F1 skill to have the best damage increasing modifiers while you use the big hitting skills. Also note that they are using a huge hitbox to get all hits from scepter 2.
---
Now learning a rotation properly can be hard and time consuming depending on the class, some classes are a bit easier and some are a bit harder. Something that certain people underestimate is the importance of skill order in rotations, they do matter! So do exactly as they do in the video. Things that you will not notice easily if you are new to the class or inexperienced to the class is that for DH for example there are some tricks to increase your DPS. 
---
First trick you'll see is the aftercast canceling of GS4 (the symbol). Once the symbol is on the floor your character will do some animation to pull the greatsword out of the ground, now this animation adds no damage and is just a waste of time. You can cancel that part of the animation simply by moving slightly in any direction once the symbol is placed on the ground. 
---
The second trick that is done is aftercast cancelling of GS5. Again this skill has some extra animation after the blades thrown at the enemy, so once that is done (I use the yellow cast bar as a reference to when to cancel the animation) you weapon stow your weapon (make sure to keybind that), press auto attack and instantly after press the skill you want to use (if its not auto attacking ofc).
---
Another thing that I encountered is that scepter 2 can 'bug out' a little bit if you are not instantly queueing another skill after scepter 2, even if the next skill you wanna use is an auto attack you have to press it after scepter 2. If you don't press anything your scepter 2 will have a longer cast time (\~500ms vs \~300ms).
---
A good way of getting feedback on your rotation is by parsing your ArcDPS log from the golem and compare it with the log from the benchmark. Things you should pay attention to is cancelled auto attacks (if it is the first one in the chain you are being slow, if you cancel the last one in the chain you are a bit too fast), the amount of hits on GS2 (less hits means you either cancel the skill by casting another, or you weapon swap to scepter too early) cast times on certain skills (GS4 GS5, Scepter 2). You can see all of this if you click on your name at the top, then go to player summary, then in the below below player summary you should see 'Simple rotation' and 'Damage distribution'. 
---
I should add that the rotation for DH is a bit dependent on the boss, as rotations slightly change, either after phases or you starting a boss on scepter.
---
My teenager self has clocked 6 thousand hours there. And I was mostly playing solo and only pugging endgame (DoA, FoW, UW, urgoz). Lot of potential playtime in that game, even with a low player population.
---
As you say you wanna become a pro guardian player then this will involve playing condi firebrand too, which I gotta say i a really fun class to play. So again make sure to have the proper gear/food/traits/infusions. The gear setup looks a bit weird with the grieving/sinister/viper mix, so be carefull that you don't mess that up. 
---
So again here, try to understand what they are doing. Alot of your damage comes from your F1 tome. So this build uses axe which is has a good auto attack, and it uses a scepter which in general you'd say is a power weapon and not a condi weapon. The only reason why you use a scepter is because you get an extra symbol which hits alot of times, and through your traits this will result in extra burning. While you are on scepter you don't wanna auto attack cause its really bad for a condi build. So you fill your time first with tome, then you use scepter 2 again and you fill the rest of time with skills like torch 4 torch 5 and swords of justice. After that you use scepter 2 again and swap to axe and you stay on axe untill your tome is back off cooldown. While on axe always be sure to finish your auto attack chains. Thats the main idea with condi firebrand. 
---
Now there are some things you need to be aware of, with DH we had tricks that increase DPS, sadly with firebrand there are bugs that you want to prevent from happening that otherwise will lower your DPS. 
---
First of all there is Torch 4, which can automatically trigger from a trait or you can trigger it yourself by using your weapon skill. So what happens is that you want to throw your Torch 4 and they will always line up (the one from the trait and the one from the weapon set). So what most people do is they spam that 4 button untill its all done. Well that is exactly what you should not be doing. What will happen if you spam press 4 is the following: You will throw your traited torch and queue up the next skills, the next skill is an insta cast so thats instantly done and the weapon torch throw is queued. if you then keep spamming the weapon torch is thrown but then it still queue's another torch 4 because the skill has no cooldown by itself. The game does not realise that you only have 1 charge left and once you throw your weapon torch 4 that charge is gone. So another torch 4 is queue'ed up, and half way the cast the game realises that there is no charge left for that cast, which will make the cast cancel. This means that you cast torch 4 in total 3 times (last one being \~200 ms shorter cast time) and only hitting 2 times with torch 4. So in the end you waste \~400-500 ms, which is bad ofc.
---
So to not make this happen all you have to do is double tap torch 4 during the cast of your 1st torch 4. Then it should be fine.
---
Another thing that can bug out (shouldn't happen if you follow benchmark rotation but it might happen if you mess up on boss or something) is axe 2. More specifically swapping to scepter instantly after axe 2. If you are too fast with doing this your character won't do anything for 1-1.5s after swapping the weapons. To not make this happen you have to wait a tiny bit or use another skill after axe 2 before swapping to scepter.
---
Again to get feedback on your rotation compare your log with a log from the benchmark. Things to look out for is again cancelled auto attacks. If it is the first in the chain you are a bit slow, if its the last you are a bit too fast. Another thing I want to point out is that the axe auto's are hitting twice, and the hits are not exactly at the same time. So it can happen that you cancel the last hit of the 3rd auto (which is quite a big loss) but it will still show up as a NOT cancelled skill. So you might want to check the amount of hits on your 3rd auto attack. Other things are the amount of hits on torch 5, last hit does alot of burning so you want to get that, amount of cast vs hits on torch 4, if the number is not equal to eachother you spam pressed torch 4 (or you were too late casting the traited one). Also the amount of hits on scepter 2 (play with snap to target on golem for best results) can play a role. Do note that depending on where you end in your rotation the amount of hits can be a bit lower than it actually was if you kill the golem just after you cast scepter 2. 
---
I guess these are some pitfalls for both of the classes to get best DPS out of the class. As for the masteries and every piece of content unlocked; masteries aren't needed to get high dps, every piece of content unlocked makes sure that you can get all the gear you need. As for time I personally like to go on golem for an hour or so and really looking closely at the video + the log and comparing what I do differently. Really looking at your own logs is probably the best way of identifying where you are being slow or what you are doing different. If you still feel lost at some point, join the snow crows helpdesk discord and ask there in this case in the guardian channel, plenty of people there that are willing to help you out and point you in the right direction.
---
Well, the split is up to negotiations between players. You can always come up with own idea of how it will be split, and either both parties come to concensus or not. 
---
The knowledge is there. Craft legendaries and sell them to lazy people. The rest is just partial steps for same main goal. Depends on every person if they can and want to do only partial steps or whole process and that is main denominator of how big their share of profit will be big.
---
Other thing you mentioned is about defensive abilities. If you run the normal build your defensive abilities are limited to F2 F3 and your heal. Your heal (Lithany of wrath) will heal you for like 25% of the damage you do, this also works on condi damage so it is usable for condi firebrand aswell and is really good for VG for example to heal yourself back up after a green. For DH this heal skill allows you to maintain scholar uptime and also gives you some retal through a trait, and retal increases your damage through another trait. F2 is a leap that at the end will heal up to 5 targets, pretty good ability if you see someone else low or if you are low yourself. Then F3 allows you to face tank certain attacks (Deimos mind crush without going into bubble for example) that can gain you some nice DPS uptime.
---
For firebrand things are a bit more complicated as F2 and F3 each give 5 other skills for you to use. But the flavour is still the same F2 is focused on healing, F3 is focused on defending. F2 #5 gives a buff that increases healing done to them so you wanna use that first and then use some other of the F2 skills to heal. Main thing to remember about F3 is that #5 gives thoughness so that can mess up tanking so best to not use that, #4 is resistance and #3 is a reflect. Will take some time to get used to that. Also mostly the heal that is taken on firebrand is the mantra (with some exceptions) that gives aegis and some healing to allies.
---
Yes we should go back to pre HoT days and require ppl to have 15k AP to join.
---
just get another 200, whats your problem. for my first 90 i bought infu too and regret it as well, but i played more and now i have 1500+
---
your issue is temporary setback and not sth that requires awareness etc (though you make a point that potion can't be dropped so should count as kp)
---
You're the worst regular poster on this sub. The literal worst. Kudos to you on your achievement.
---
I'd like to buy [New Horizons Mount Adoption License](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/New_Horizons_Mount_Adoption_License) but I don't have warclaw, beetle and skyscale, so it means I will gain skin only for my unlocked mounts? Instead of 15 possible skins I have only 8 options?
---
Yeah! Guild MM will hate to pry my 20k unused spirit shards from my dead hands! What a bunch of exploitative douches.
---
Statistically speaking this is rather *sux*.
---
Make your own group then. Jeez
---
[Hilt bash](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Hilt_Bash) is still a daze when used from the front. Skill 4 puts up a block for 3 seconds, any ranged attacks at you are blocked and any melee attacks are countered (blocks the attack then tries to kick away). When you start the 3 second block with [counterattack](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Counterattack) the skill flips over and changes to [crippling throw](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crippling_Throw), and if used will stop blocking and instead throw your sword at range 900. If you cast other skills it will stop casting counterattack and blocking, yes.
---
More balance passes for professions.  It's not ok to update once in a 3 months and see how it rolls every each time. Less we feel like stacking certain professions is better, better the balance is.
---
Map collision updates on several towers and keeps, just to be sure that a warclaw and/or good jumping skills are not helpful to enter one alone.
---
Fun WvW events. Skill steal was ok for example. People didn't have to use them or they could, it was up to players and didn't break anything like portable cannon weekend. No down state weekends are ok unless they are not too frequent.
---
A new map. It doesn't have to be breathtaking super new and original map. It could use same assets, we don't care, we just want different terrains, fighting environments etc.
---
Grace period for profession changing without falling off from a map but I'm afraid to see never ending queues. It's a delicate matter and demands more player cap or a reason for people to play on commanderless, desolate, empty maps while they wait (maybe a reason to fill every each map) As I said this is a delicate matter. If we had a balanced environment this wouldn't be much of an issue though.
---
As last, better rewards. It's a bad game design if I have enough tokens to create a desired item while I don't have the raw gold required to complete the purchase while other game mods players just getting it randomly 3-4 times in a week with less play time without spending a single gold coin.
---
Fantasia intensifies
---
Alliances.. Helloooo
---
But we saw the new map already in the teasers?
---
If you have this selected this story chapter in replay mode you should look for the purple stars on the map: green stars are the classic story instances and the purple ones are usually the ones that allow you to only restart at a specific point for achievements.
---
This mechanics has been introduced more and more since HoT and the latest episodes of LS4 seem to allow you to do that with a very precise granularity.
---
This ^
---
Condis are weak at lower levels, so avoid that until you get to end game then there are plenty of options. 
---
Also don't fall in to the minion trap. Many do and then they hit lvl 80 and want to do instanced content such as fracals as a full minion manacer and suddenly you are on your own and need to adjust to it in a much harder content then leveling is.
---
Besides as a necro with all that aoe damage from wells all though i use dagger/warhorn and staff (for pulling aggro and slowing them down) and wells when i level necro you can pull half the map move to a line out of sight point and then drop all your aoe on top of them and use the 4 and 5 on your death shrud. Anything should be dead after that.
---
Yeah I actually meant mastery level. Sounds cool! Is PoF necessary for maximum gameplay fun?
---
People are arglebargling, but really it's the GW1 folks who have the most to lose here.  
---
He probably got married or got a new house or something.
---
Just make a new character. Devs already told us that it is not possible to make that change. 
---
If you don't have the money for it farm silver waste or Dragon fall for a few days and convert.
---
You can make that in a couple days just farming the new herbs or doing some metas and cashing in volatile magic.
---
What is soulbound aside from some cheap exotics and bag expansion in this game?
---
Dialogues have triggers before they trigger to detect races. That's how it's normally done in games that have variable terms in the same dialogue.
---
Tomes of knowledge, buy heropoints in WvW, no need for mapcompletion and adding waypoints is not that hard. More birthday gifts with new character (i have 50 imagine all my presents every year) and the only important thing that you need is ascended and it is account bound. Exotics you can craft or get anywere and wardrobe works.
---
You don't have to delete your old one. Buy a extra slot.
---
So the usual "5min of actual information packed into an hour of repeated rambling" WP video then?
---
Old prophecies screen where you could see all of your characters.
---
Damn I already went thru a lot in spite. I just yolod it and now regretting hard. Also everyone is saying go axe, should I worry about the axe stats or is it purely for the skills they give you.
---
I'm pretty concerned with your attention span if you can't handle one yt video XD  
---
For pve you'll need dagger/warhorn, for damage and swiftness+dmg, as well as some cc.   
---
Other set can be whatever, preferably staff, marks have some utility.   
---
For your skills go with the signet that boosts your power, and the one which boosts movement speed.   
---
Healing skill can be either consume conditions or the well.   
---
Your 3rd utility skill is more or less up to you, pick a well or whatever you want.   
---
Elite is flesh golem.
---
I had someone do this to me three times last week.
---
Finally I went in, triggered the mobs to spawn, then left for the next mode before he could get there.
---
Came back and he was just standing there, waiting for someone else to go in...so I went in, drew agro, and as soon as he followed, I left.
---
He almost died before he finally escaped after only getting one node.
---
Sorry I keep thinking about stuff as I post sorry. So one more thing is getting an axe is for the skill set it gives you or does it normally have better stats compared to other weps?
---
- Getting two characters to lvl 80 from 21/49 after that ascended gear
---
- 3/4 hours
---
- Pretty newbish so almost no masteries. Have Raptor/Glider and Expansions as well as two 80s (with the expansion scrolls).
---
- Around 100g liquid. Did some fractals and stuff on my 80 char with friends. Not willing to spend a lot of real-life money. 90k Karma in Storage. Leveling chars are Guardian and Ranger. 80s are Rev (almost not played) and Mesmer (did easier Fractals with some friends).
---
&gt; It reminds me a bit about how there is no way to take away a wardrobe unlock. Once it's done, there's nothing on their end that they can do because the system wasn't designed to do it. Just with a character instead of account.
---
That sounds wack, why wouldn‚Äôt a wardrobe unlock just be a simple flag in the DB?
---
Good morning all, i decided to start playing GW2 and i get the big bundle (80e). I received an email to wait 48h. So as i understand is that i have to wait to it? because now passed over 30h and i still waiting the email and in my account the expansions appears as i have to buy them. Is that normal?
---
Yea ppl are suggesting don't do minions a lot. I guess I have to keep in mind all the stuff I do now will be changed during later lvl stuff. Tyty
---
Is there a tl/dr or a better written explanation?
---
Should run radiance and bane signet share almost everywhere in fractals.
---
Say, is phantasm mesmer good for anything besides open world pve? I have a sword/pistol and greatsword chronomancer that is dear to me because basically the same build used to be my main since the base game. Returning player, btw
---
wow that is good.
---
I'm guessing that for every time that's happened to you, I've found an ad hoc party where we unofficially formed up together and made sure to crush any and all mobs at each node before anyone harvested...then waited for everyone to harvest...then moved in together...all without a single chat message.
---
There's self centered d-bags there for sure, but overall I've had good experiences.
---
How can you say that? Do you play the story and leave?
---
There's map completion and achievements; armor sets and mounts. There are tons of things to do from each episode, especially with the addition of Vision. People have an outdated view of "there's so little content in each episode. Ohmagerd."
---
I suppose people just don't remember the days of Season 2. THOSE episodes were small.
---
And I'm sitting here with my 350 Gold ....
---
3 autos in reaper shroud and everything but the vet  is dead lol
---
I really like how you can just not play for years and come back to play the story updates without needing to grind at all.
---
The story gets pretty good after the first expension. You don't need to play all the time and burn yourself. I really recommand not quitting before getting to the seasons content.
---
The tought thing for you will probably be getting heros point in HoT but many builds can now solo them nowaday.
---
If you want to properly adapt to the more difficult post level 80 content, then minions are objectively terrible. 
---
Not only their damage is trash, but they also allow you to skip on learning how to properly dodge, making you over reliant on the low damage minions.
---
So what the guys above said. Avoid minions like the plague, except for the healing minion which does have its use, and the golem elite skill which is in fact used in some builds. The rest of your utility skills (7, 8 and 9) should go into the skills that were discussed above, namely wells and the signet that gives you a power boost.
---
Here's the miracle of scrapper engineering technology: [fire-skimmer](https://i.imgur.com/77HFnMX.jpg) and [deadly wabbit](https://i.imgur.com/JVIAwCJ.jpg). Meanwhile, who says mesmers can't go with more [dark themes](https://i.imgur.com/eHZQJ14.jpg) than pink butterflies :P
---
Yes, you just proved ypu are. These things you mention are older than season 8 of GoT. 
---
You just played yourself, son.
---
Nice art style , very cartoony
---
He is right in the sense this thread is 100% pointless because linking anything isn't representative of skill specially when you can fake link anything in this game.
---
If you want better groups, tell them to link their gear since that would be harder and take longer instead of just a few kp
---
minions bring more inconveniences than benefits. sure, you are less likely to die, but even normal mob groups are gonna take rather long to kill, and they will constantly drag you into combat, making normal traversal ridiculously slow. but the worst part about minions, and especially starting out with them, is that a new player is going to form bad habits by getting too used and reliant on them.
---
Spit it out spit it out!
---
You can find just as much similarities between star wars and Lord of the rings. 
---
Similarities in some aspect doesnt indicate a correlation. Much less so a cause to effect.
---
Thank you for the tips!
---
&gt; You can buy them \[Shards of Glory, Memories of Battle\] off the TP with liquid gold 
---
Completely missed this myself, very valuable. As for the Coins and the Clovers, they aren't of an immediate concern to me right now, I simply passively farm them by doing the Ley-Line Anomaly once a day, and getting Clovers from WvW Gift of Battle reward track. As far as I know you need 200 Spirit Shards for a legendary, I have nearly 500 so that should be enough for a while.
---
&gt; Join the daily LS4 meta trains for this, they last 2.5-3h, I'll pm you the Discord link(s) if you haven't joined them yet. 
---
I haven't, but I am nearly done with the Thunderhead part, so Sandswept hopefully won't be that much of an issue anymore.
---
&gt; Remember to always use volatile magic gathering tools, the current value of it is through the roof. 
---
I'm afraid I don't understand this part. How is it's value high, when it cannot be traded directly? Is it because of items that are bought for VM, and then sold on the TP?
---
Jormag seems to be trying to appeal to reason almost, offering allegiance instead of servitude (it's almost certainly a lie, but still). I could see him thinking that in order to preserve the future for his people, he needs to accept the Ice Dragon's help. His arrogance could probably lead him to believing he has the willpower to remain himself.
---
Picking Blood first is purely for the 25% movement speed boost, I wouldn't worry too much about it since Spite is also a good line. The stats on your axe should also focus on Power, combinations with precision and/or ferocity are great.
---
you can also change the stat in the mystic toilette, and that also resets the skin to the stock
---
Dragonfall meta is pretty popular and profitable, look it up. It's last episode of ls4.
---
Shadow fiend &amp; bone minions are used for condi though
---
Thats my point, that second argument is false. 
---
Youll only pick bad habits if you refuse to pay attention, in which case not having minions wouldnt make a difference except you die more. I undertand how it makes sense on paper, but ingame it just doesnt matter. 
---
If hes going to play necro, chances are hes going to be using minions for open world anyway, its silly to recommend someone to cripple their gameplay just because they might want to play harder content later. What if they dont? What if open world is their main content? 
---
And for the first issues you mentionned, I never experienced that, so I dont understand it. Ive never had a harder time wandering with necro than other classes other than HoT pocket raptors and minions take care of those easy peasy.
---
Minions are great when starting out, they make the game so much easier, and allow you to breeze through the story. And that is also the problem, because it's so easy you don't need to learn how to dodge properly. But if you're struggling at level 20ish, go minions.
---
They probably mean that you have to wait 48 hours to get your restrictions lifted, but you can access the expansion content. If not, wait 18 more hours and see what happens.
---
imma just reply here to all your questions..btw you can edit your comment instead of posting a new one
---
note: there is a lot of information i'm skipping because the game is kinda complex and i don't wanna confuse you..also make sure your gear is at least green-tier(masterwork) if not yellow(rare) with power-oriented stats
---
minions have their place but they are situational..flesh golem and shadow fiend are the most used ones! they aren't bursty though which is what you need/want so definitely follow the above advice(the 2 wells with signet and dagger)
---
dagger is your highest dps weapon until you go reaper and get a greatsword..only the autoattack though, other 2 skills are utility
---
axe is there if you ever need range and skill #2 is great damage and life force generation(the autoattack is very bad, like 40% compared to dagger and only used if you need range)..99% of the time you take a weapon for its skills
---
tl;dr traits: spite 122, soul reaping 112, bloodmagic 231(numbers refer to their position so 1=top 2=mid 3=bottom
---
I think he could work well in either role depending how he's written. A villain with nuance and some conflict is just as compelling to me as a protagonist. For gw2 I think I'd prefer a villain though, we've had very few that have much complexity in motivation.
---
I love the fact you drew it in the Cuphead drawing style
---
So..... this post is not just about linking proof. Like I mentioned in the title and in the first sentence I clearly stated that it is a vent AND wanting to see if others are experiencing this.
---
Yep! From my experience, it doesn't even matter if another enemy team flips it, then yours does and you still get the credit.
---
Their interpretation of "replayable" tends (imo) to be "lets make it super grindy or timegatey"
---
Only real use for minions is popping then for lifeforce and swapping them out instantly
---
But it costs at least 30 bucks in key shops and nobody is playing it.
---
How long did it take for you to get these?
---
Thats not really miles ahead when WoWs been doing race changes for years
---
Is there a comprehensive guide for merchants that sell something of note? This is the most confusing part for me right now. There are probably merchants that everyone knows that sell standard items that everyone need, but I don't have the feintest idea where to find them
---
Is this a joke? Wiping all progress is the same as creating a new character.  Do you have a job?  If so, buy some gems and a waypoint unlock pack, and create a new character with the race you want.  Move your ascended and account bound gear over, and you're done - except for all that personal story that is now locked for you.
---
&gt; i have 50 imagine all my presents every year
---
i imagine you get 50
---
&gt;I simply passively farm them by doing the Ley-Line Anomaly once a day, and getting Clovers from WvW Gift of Battle reward track. 
---
If you enjoy this, go ahead, but in terms of efficiency it's pretty bad. 2g/10min or 12g/h, there are tons of things (I've listed a few) that you can do to get much more gold and then buy the MC needed. It's a matter of fun vs efficiency, your choice! 
---
&gt;As far as I know you need 200 Spirit Shards for a legendary, I have nearly 500 so that should be enough for a while.
---
It's actually closer to 341, but you still have enough :) 
---
&gt;I haven't, but I am nearly done with the Thunderhead part, so Sandswept hopefully won't be that much of an issue anymore.
---
Perfect, be sure to gather everything you find there, the value is immense, again, with volatile magic tools! 
---
&gt;I'm afraid I don't understand this part. How is it's value high, when it cannot be traded directly? Is it because of items that are bought for VM, and then sold on the TP?
---
Yes, you can trade VM for trophy shipments and sell the mats at the TP for ~47c/VM. Check out [this link](https://gw2lunchbox.com/IstanShipments.html)
---
i sent it to a professor who is a well known cryptocharactologist and is is an expert in old krytan, it says ‚Äúmai aurin tangina‚Äù which literally translates to ‚Äúbuy aurene funkopops‚Äù although the last word might mean leggings too. wish someone else who is an expert can shed light on this.
---
It seems that the community still loves more HoT than PoF - that'd be due to way how the second expansion is designed; with Path of Fire you have maps that are more like the core game ones - you explore these more or less peacefully, fill out hearts etc. Initially, PoF has worse rewards from meta events which were also bit difficult (Serpent's Ire was barely doable) but devs fixed both aspects. People also are saying that PoF offered less than HoT but they're forgetting that PoF is not just the expansion but whole season that comes along with it, which expands desert region with new maps - not mention that the conclusion of expansion story (hell, even more than expansion story that but.. that'd be a spoiler) takes place in S4. 
---
PoF mounts will definitely change your movement across all maps - some spots will become more accessible because of jumping springer (rabbit) or flying skyscale (the *helicopter* lizard/dragon), or you'll start seeing environment differently - skimmer (stingray) hovers and gains speed over water surfaces. Griffon is also fun and if you find right spot, you can traverse map in less time than before. There's one significant flaw in mounts design - the dismount feature is giving unfair and unnecessary advantage when it comes to tagging mobs for events; before a low level player will manage to attack anything, enemies are being smashed by raptors tails or rabbits cannon ball rolls. 
---
As for elite specializations, I'm happy what I've got for most of the part: guardian's firebrand gives quickness and/or heals with proper build and along with revenant's renegade who spams alacrity - both are prominently used in fractals. Elementalist's weaver gives you new way of playing with function keys responsible for elements attunement, mesmer's mirage behaves IMO like deceptive spinning pink mosquito (the blurring dodge is really cool tho you have to get used to it). On the other hand, I'm not that familiar with holosmith (with sword) or deadeye (with rifle), or spellbreaker (daggers) but people play these too.
---
&gt; pugging endgame (DoA, FoW, UW, urgoz)
---
I admire your willpower. I wouldn't touch a PUG DoA group with a 10 foot pole.
---
Wow what a nice and detailed answer! Thanks a lot my friend!!
---
For casual play? Nah. As long as you have gear and runes aimed at condi build.
---
The OP is talking about dying to "chip damage" in "PoF or HoT" maps.  Sounds to me like the OP is getting bombed with conditions and dying from them.
---
I'd suggest having a look at the Illusions traitline for both Mender's Purity (cleanse 1 condition when using Heal skill) and Sympathetic Visage (when you summon a Phantasm, transfer 1 condition to them).
---
You can also run Mantra of Resolve as a last ditch solution.
---
Power Mirage is perfectly fine for open world, it just doesn't have the sustained power DPS you would get from Chrono, so against a Champion or in a Fractal it wouldn't be effective.  But bursting open world mobs? Yeah it works fine.
---
I need a stack of amalgamated gemstones for Exordium.  Can login 1-2 hours a day. I am currently trying to do metas and craft them directly from orbs / also upgrading gems to orbs. Is there a more convenient recipe? 
---
Also need ~140 more shards, currently farming Malchor's Leap tree farm daily with 6 characters and volatile tools
---
Whenever a crucial dev leaves/resigns from the studio before a releas3 of an update or addition to a game, be super fkin concerned.
---
I went easy mode with minion master - I'm not sure how the unlock system works now, but back in the day I'd pair Axe+warhorn and scepter+focus (or throw in a dagger). Your minions should help, and use your shroud when it's available. I personally like the skill that stacks power with each cast of the 1 skill in shroud. 
---
For Open world PvE, necro is great (especiallyReaper is an unstoppable nightmare that mows down everything in their path. I don't run it in fractals/raids/dungeons though, because even with non-minion builds people have a kneejerk reaction to necros (so I opt for ele or guard in those cases).
---
For gemstones do gemstone runs (~1.5h, ~30g including 7 gemstones), join a community that runs them daily and join them when you have the time, can be done once a day per account. 
---
For shards, max your HoT and PoF masteries to be able to farm them during the gemstone runs to maximize your time efficiency! You can also buy the empowerment for the LS4 maps to get even more XP if needed, but I don't think it's worth it for your little playtime. You'll be able to get around 10 shard during each of this train. If you're very far from maxing them, SW RIBA is a good option, too that fits your playtime and is more fun that logging trees imo, while netting around 16g/h. 
---
You'll need around 15 gemstone runs to get 250 amalgamated and the 100 shards, also ~22.5h. 105 gemstones from the trains and the rest can be bought or crafted with the surplus gold from selling your unneeded items!
---
To be clear then, those news outlets are shitty news outlets. At no point has ANet made any mention of IBS (an unfortunate initialism to be sure) being an expansion, but a new living world season. Indeed, in other interviews they've explicitly said they've heard the community wants an expansion and they are taking it into consideration.
---
In FF14 you are forced to play 200h+ story on a new character just to be up to date
---
use the mentor tag and map chat/lfg and/or try around choya pinata timer.
---
in the future, imo the best gold investment in the game is a commander tag. tag up and lfg and you can get enough random help doing pretty much anything in any map (except full metas ofc)
---
Just 2? Slacker!
---
Sorry I meant the Shards of Exitare that you craft with tons of wood and mithril. I am literally drowning in Spirit Shards :D
---
I loved the griffon collection but I hate this one. Even the very first collection is way too long. You have to go around Dragonfall sooo many times. Honestly, at this point, I don't know if I'll ever finish it - it's just too much of a chore. I wouldn't mind if it was at least somewhat fun but it's just not.
---
What I want is profession change at least on the same archetype...
---
Do I need the diviner armor recipe do craft diviner armor ? [For example the Steelstar's Visor.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Steelstar%27s_Visor)
---
The folks they're buying shards from are also getting paid. 
---
As with any form of capitalism or business on the planet, there are those who make the base materials and sell them to those who will repurpose those materials into something useful. Furniture companies aren't ripping off the lumberjack because they're selling a table for a lot more than they bought the log for. 
---
Naturally any player is able to use the same methods listed in the video to turn their own spirit shards into something profitable IF they have the initial capital and the desire to do so. But for many who just don't care about being mad rich in-game, they're at least turning those stockpiles of shards into some level of meaningful profit while those a step up in the chain are putting in the effort and time to turn them into something sellable. 
---
This isn't manipulation, it's basic supply and demand.
---
Maybe they could do it only for characters that have completed the personal story? After the PS is over there could be a little reward icon saying "Unlocked: Race Transfer". That way when you changed races, you'd only have to re-make the choices, but since the PS is over, it'd automatically be filled out and you'd have the same LW progress as before.
---
Yeah but the game is so easy out of actual challenging content that you dont need to act like you need the practice. A large part of the new players will never reach that content, theyll stay in content that is trivial enough that it doesnt really matter. 
---
Imagine if you come to gw2, want to play a necro and always enjoyed minions, you only want to play, explore the world and reach max level and then figure out whats next, and you see this thread on reddit, people acting like playing minions is shooting yourself in the foot, bla bla bla. 
---
It can be very discouraging, it might even give a false sense of the game's difficulty and discourage more casual players. 
---
I dont think its fair to say to op to not use a certain playstyle by assuming he wants to "get good" and be as efficient as possible right away. Let him enjoy himself with actual advice for actual levelling, and then when he has issues later IF he tries harder content, we can then point him in the right direction. 
---
I understand the feeling, I also dislike when new players boost their first chracter to 80. But its a different issue, skipping to 80 you literally dont have the opportunity to learn, minions dont take that away, they just make it easier.
---
They're effective, but they're brain-dead and have very little active gameplay elements to them.  You can use them to solo Champions in attrition set-ups to some extent, but they're relatively low-impact compared to wells.  There's not really a meaningful way to be a "Minion Master," in GW2 because there isn't an effective way to scale minion damage.  
---
They're cool skills that are very skill-floor oriented; whereas wells are a little more moderate-skill oriented.  Well of Corruption has the added benefit of corrupting boons into conditions and Well of Suffering stacks a ton of vulnerability.  Vulnerablility is a 1% damage increase for power damage all the way up to 25% (Axe 2 stacks a fair bit of vulnerability too).  You can clear the game with minions -- there's nothing "wrong" with them, but they're just not particularly engaging. 
---
It's better for players to have to care about their individual positioning and strafing skills.  It takes a little practice to learn how to strafe around enemies, when to dodge and when minions are front-lining for you it's a little like a Bear-Bow Ranger.  Nothing really threatens you or gives you any practice so when it comes time to deal with AoE's or attack animations that your minions can't mitigate for you, minion-oriented Necromancer players tend to be pretty helpless.  
---
Minion aggro isn't something that's easily controlled either; they can cause all sorts of unwanted issues.  Overall, wells also have the potential to crit really hard and can benefit from damage modifiers in soul reaping.  You toss down your wells and let them tick while you're doing additional damage in Death Shroud or Reaper Shroud and they'll do crazy damage.
---
This guy did the math
---
episode 1 was speculated to be November by a interviewer. We still have the entire next month of recycled content to go through after our "2 weeks of content" with the prologue
---
I'd buy the total makeover kit. Name change, gender change, it's practically a new character.
---
And karma!
---
LFG, post in map chat, ping your guild and pop a tag. Youd be amazed how fast you'll get 30+ people. Guildie of mine was struggling a few weeks ago I popped a comm tag, pinged map chat, posted on LFG "Corrupted Facet for Griffon - event not up!" And pinged my guilds. We had about 10 from guilds and another 15-20 from map and LFG show up
---
Regarding racial armor: Simply check if the user is wearing racial armor when starting the change and tellthem "You first have to remove all racial armor to change your race", maybe even check the inventory and display a warning that the user still has racial armor they won't be able to equip in their inventory.
---
Well played,I think a good power Chrono would be welcome in fractals, but make sure you let people know you're dps, not boons.
---
Typically your off hand would be sword (DPS) or shield (alac) or focus (cc/pull), but I'm not sure how much of a downgrade pistol would be.
---
Absolutely. Just depends on if there are other aspects of the character worth keeping, like for birthday gifts, or account bound items. I'd definitely deleted a character and remade them in another race despite the birthday loss, but said character wasn't getting played at ALL because I hated the way he was, so it was worth it to me.
---
Minions are great for surviving, because the game's AI will almost always target them first.  You will be able to safely do damage from a distance while the minions take the hits.
---
***However,*** minions are bad in the sense of you getting too used to the crutch and never learning how to actively play.  Minions don't deal much damage so there are better skills for almost every slot (though I'd argue that Flesh Golem is the best of all Necro elites only because of the short recharge time).
---
A lot of people who relied too much on minions struggle when they reach content that is more challenging, because their growth was hampered by the Easy Mode that minions create.
---
Oh god yes... I really miss those early Factions days... Cantha was amazing.
---
Ah sorry I thought you meant staff and something else at the same time. I get wut you mean now.
---
I mean people leave jobs all the time.  WoW has had many devs leave but nobody bats an eye.  Seriously, you guys need to calm down.  It's getting pretty ridiculous at this point.
---
People setting arbitrary rules for joining their party judge based on arbitrary rules, instead of factual data.  Odd.
---
is the dragons name fart box?
---
Only high IQ will get it.
---
YEESSSSSSSS, me too.
---
Imo the Skyscale is just better than the griffon.
---
I get that there is a novelty to the griffon but the amount of times I'm going to climb really high to use it is probably like, once.
---
Mounts to me are just a means to get from A-&gt;B, Skyscale is great for that but griffon not so much.
---
This game is crazy.
---
I swear the devs use ''hard to code'' for basically every feature they don't want to implement.
---
Makes you think that they planned their code very poorly, or they've lost their talented software
---
engineers.
---
Unfortunately Factions was my first Guild Wars (and that's why Cantha will always have a special place in my heart, I miss the Jade Sea), so I never experienced the Prophecies log in screen
---
Maybe the whole wardrobe is stored in a massive binary string and they don't have any dev time to spend on writing something to change it back?
---
Okay, so you think I am promoting he doesnt try? What? Did you read my comment? Im saying that many dont reach that content and to advise a player to completely alter his gameplay because you assume that hes going to need to learn all those mechanics is not a good thing. 
---
&gt; i mean... i kind of feel like informing a new player of a certain playstyle likely having unbeneficial consequences down the line is the lesser evil here... by a large margin.
---
Thats fine, I mean, whatever, I dont see any evil being commited here but hey, whatever helps you sleep at night. Its just 2 different views of a situation arguing agaisnt each other, no one is doing anything wrong.
---
yeah well, i never say you will need it absolutly 100%, but there will thinks where it will be easyer to have it. like with the roallerbeatel, its just qol think.
---
New content every 2 months was pretty good.
---
The complaining started when 2 months became 3-6 months.
---
He's saying that having the home instance nodes makes it not so bad but having to farm open world sucks. I suspect esl.
---
&gt; let's say we get 25% of the content normally in a episode but get new content every 2-3 weeks
---
That's just called Season 1.
---
The number is based on the average player's potential. The deviation between a low performer and high performer is always there; so, we don't look at outliers, only the average.
---
As for using the TP to gauge the cost of these items, it is inaccurate due to players like Guild MM who have severely depreciated the real cost of the gen 1 legendaries due to excess supply, which they have gathered through much reduced investment (ie: severely underpaying players for their materials).
---
They still make a healthy margin (close to what should be expected by everyone), but the ones being exploited and the every other player loses out on a lot. The whole "operation" has a much larger impact on the actual economy, than them just taking advantage of these players...and there's nothing that ANet can do about it - they COULD have done something YEARS ago (by making gen 1 legendaries account bound to reduce the impact on the economy vastly), but that ship has long sailed.
---
While the reduced price of gen 1 legendaries can be appreciated by those who purchase these legendaries directly from TP (their customers) - most times through the purchase of gem (converted to gold) with $ - the overall impact on the economy is bad (to put it simply). It highly devalues the legendaries, causing the average players to lose more than they realistically should, while he continues to make the appropriate margin because of his "operation", which lets him essentially acquire the materials at a much lower price.
---
TL;DR: The rabbit hole is deeper than you think.
---
&gt;I dont see that at the wow reddit (and blizzard has like 1k ppl working on wow) or eso or FF.
---
so you're saying wow reddit didn't have a single thread about the activision blizzard layoffs?
---
Focus on damage so roll a dagger and probably warhorn and I like axe for both the animations and damage. Minions make everything fairly easy but it's a terrible way to learn the game so go for well skills. They are just brain dead and dont do any damage. They're used to tank a bit if you're a reaper and just kinda roaming, but again boring.
---
I misread, my bad. 
---
Anyway there's no way GW2 is not gonna sell another piece of content ever so it's a little early to say "all future content".
---
Aye I‚Äôm having the same problems myself, only difference is that my current charr has maxed out leatherworker and weaponsmith and it‚Äôs too costly and a pita to do it all again
---
Ohw thanks a lot. 2 30 am but I'll definitely add when I jump back on. In NZ tho lol dunno about times.
---
Why would there be a new launcher? its not anew xpac. 
---
Xpac brings tons of money, they wont give all this shit for free, like do away with them and call them sagas. They just need to roll out Xpacs better. and this LW is not it.
---
well im only missing mystic clovers and spirt shards rest is done and ready to use thanks for your tips will problaly farm riba now
---
It has to be something like that just for the sheer amount of data they need to store per char/ account.
---
Which is funny, since they did something similar years prior when they released World 2 of SAB along side Ascended Armor crafting. I remember only really stepping inside of SAB W2 enough to beat the first zone, but I spent most of that update farming/gathering materials to deck out my main in Ascended.
---
Easier to have is not the same as need. You said need. It's already a hige QoL improvement so that wouldn't change one way or the other in Season 5.
---
If resetting it is an issue, is just marking it as completed (but not unlocking the achievements) possible?
---
**Goal**: to craft  legendary armor (light set).
---
**Playtime**: I have around 5 to 10 hours per week, but not on a fixed schedule.
---
**Content**: All of it
---
**Additional**: 55 Legendary Insights. Ascended equipment for all 9 classes, except for tank/healer builds. I can also play PvP / WvW, but prefer the PvE version.
---
You didn't want a 10 bajillion column table or a table with a row per unlock?
---
We are getting the full trailer for the prologue today, alongside the actual release. No mention of the trailer for the first episode to be released today. And honestly, I wouldn't expect one either, as the first episode was speculated to be in November by an interviewer. So a trailer for the first episode today would be early, but I could be wrong. ([Twitter quote](https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1171454324653744130))
---
It's almost like employers extracting value out of your labor and leaving you with a mere fraction of its true value. Are there wvw blueprints for guillotines yet?
---
In all seriousness I've been sleeping on my spirit shards and basically never realized they could translate into gold efficiently so I can at least use that knowledge for myself. But anyone that says "I can teach you how to be rich" is selling you something. I already work, I'm not going to work for knuckleheads in a video game too.
---
I attended a lecture from Xushin last night, and he provided much more insight than the first 30 minutes of what you watched. They make money off basic real life economics. They all started small and grew into barons we see today. Saying that "they are after our money" is partly true. They want to make a profit, but they also want to expand the market and create a "middle class" because currently most of the community is split in "rich and poor". They use methods like Guild Bank transactions to avoid TP taxes and save a lot of money, which means their market requires a lot of trust, and scammers get blacklisted. 
---
They now came forward to "help" people get some money while they also make profit. I think they could've been making a lot of money even without doing this tutoring stuff, and your story just covers one half of the story.
---
Yeah but can you play every combat job and every crafter and every gatherer on ONE character in WoW? And change your race/gender/name at will with cash shop purchases? And keep all that progress? With just the ONE toon? (They also sell story skips now for impatient newbies and alts, fwiw, you do not have to play the full 200+ hour story anymore. I really recommend newcomers do it that first time tho)
---
Lol i swear it's not the attention span but after 10 mins it's like they're speaking a different language. Most videos kinda seem outdated too. Tyvm for the points. Ngl this list was easier to take in lol maybe it is my attention span.
---
I'm worried. Especially since he deleted his account...
---
Yeah, after not playing for 4 seasons I played this season to get tentacle chest.
---
I thought POF release scourge-fb-spb was cancerous. Not anymore.
---
Holo, mirage, condi thief, spb are pure cancer anti-fun to face. 
---
Climbed plat, got pips, not looking back. 
---
Man, actually now I think that wvw balance is better than this sh*t.
---
Wait theres not gonna be a new map and stuff?!
---
F M L
---
That's what doesn't make since.  That would mean we are getting a trailer for a release that's happening today.
---
I know a site with a timeline with images: [https://www.mundogame.com/index.php/es/sector-guild-wars-2/linea-de-tiempo-de-tyria](https://www.mundogame.com/index.php/es/sector-guild-wars-2/linea-de-tiempo-de-tyria)
---
With info from GW1 Prophecies to GW2 HOT.
---
And then BAM the best birthday presents ever are released.
---
I'm glad I asked on reddit before I loose all faith in what I picked and just delete the character. Now I kinda have a general idea of what I can do with the character. Ty fam.
---
Pretty sure M.Z said something like "team1 prologue / team2 episode1 / team 3 episode 2 / team4 something something" so ...
---
Generally speaking, while levelling, focus on Power (so direct damage). An Axe is more of a weapon for that playstyle, warhorn in offhand.
---
Power, precision, ferocity should be the attributes you aim for.
---
Condition Damage is for the "bigger guys" but even then you would need two equipment sets because the power attribute doesn't matter for damage through condition damage.
---
As for skills. Minions could be a good solution if you still struggle with getting attacked a lot because they will take the aggro from you. Signet of Spite will increase your power as passive. You can also take Well of Suffering and Corruption, Suffering is great because it applies Vulnerability which increase the damage you make on them (axe also applies vulnerability).
---
Yeah, some builds (like power slb) do rely on stab/aegis, cause if they have to dodge they lose ton of DPS (like dodging in mid of axe 5). And if you got FB in your party and get cc'ed on, say, mama or artsariv super big telegraphed hits, someone is not doing his/her job properly.
---
Yes I think a lot of people don't realize that these festivals are old and repetitive for older players. You play them for 1-2 days if at all.
---
I have 4.4k
---
New plan- too much work to make season 1 repeatable, so it'll get remade as season 5! Think of it as an enhanced remake.
---
For the record no, I'd prefer they made new stuff over rereleasing the first season given how long it takes for them to make things normally.
---
Yw, based on what you need, you will profit from literally everything in RIBA farming.
---
What kind of oppression are we talking about? Might have to bring out the hahstags or something...
---
&gt;Makes you think that they planned their code very poorly,
---
Ding ding ding! They probably didn't think gw2 was going to last this long and get as big as it is.
---
&gt; My issue/concern mostly comes down to the fact that they said they're ramping up the speed of providing content. If this isn't much of an update, and the 'real' update comes in November, that makes 6 months between LS chapters. That's not only not faster than before, it's twice as slow.
---
they were talking about cadence between future episodes not between seasons.
---
I‚Äôd be down for an incremental Dry Top style rollout.
---
Though back then, releases were a few short weeks apart. We‚Äôll have to see how this release plays out.
---
The trailer isn't for us. It's most likely aimed at people not currently invested in the game, as a "Hey look at what's coming up in GW2. And you can play it todayyyy!" kind of thing. Having trailers for things that end with *"Releases Today"* is pretty common nowadays.
---
Yeah, even if you look at blizz. All their battlegrounds are different play styles or have some unique feature to be different but not too much and it was never ever a problem. Them being unable to make a good design to not fragment players is just another reason that Anet has zero clue what they are doing with their PvP mode.
---
After 7 years I can say, conquest is the worst PvP mode I've ever played.
---
But I'm also at the point; Which PvP game mode works for GW2 class design? Not even CTF sounds like fun and that's such a forgiving mode you can throw any class design at it when you look at TFC but CTF in GW2? Ugh...
---
there will probably be plenty of achievements which require you to play for several days/weeks to complete
---
Keyfarming on alt accounts can't be that useful, since a lot of the loot would be tied to those accounts.
---
I personally use my alt accounts for nothing more than daily login &amp; daily home instance/guild hall harvest.
---
You don't think that cadence between chapters between seasons is indicative of cadence between chapters between future chapters?
---
I do intend to fully learn wut necro is capable of. Its just that whilw I was slowly figuring stuff out my mates were just out dmging me hard. I thought I was doing it wrong somehow. Lol I put a lot of time perfecting the face of my gw2 waifu. It'd be a shame to just drop it.
---
How are we supposed to know? We know no more than you.
---
Same reason why:
---
* An account has to have HoT to use any services in the PoF guild hall.
---

Minions are great, but only in open world content. They do decent damage against dumb enemies where there isn't a ton of AoE to kill them, and they take aggro so you won't take as much damage. They're also easy, just summon them and you don't have to do much to make them work. 
---
But wells are probably better for leveling, since they give you good AoE options (base necromancer doesn't have many, you need an elite spec to do AoE).
---
Plus you have the books. Ghosts Of Ascalon gave you a bit of insight to how seriously they take glory, being remembered, and dying a good death.
---
That's how it should be done and it can't be done any other way because it'll be a disaster .
---
Thank you!
---
Oh ok, Thank you!
---
It's a little odd (and dumb) to be someone says this sort of thing in a game where the entire reward structure and the gemstore are focused on cosmetics.
---
That is literally physically impossible due to time gates. The skyscale required you to complete content for multiple days.
---
Live with your decisions
---
I'm interested to know what their first language might be, if English is their second language.  The words seem close enough...  If they're spelling it out how they'd say it phonetically that's pretty damn close.
---
Lord Hizen?
---
Which is irrelevant because having multiple characters in FFXIV is pretty pointless.
---
I don't really care. Its a charr party. If they do that right, we're good. Plus, mother fucking charr racing. The most unsafe, impractical derby in the game
---
Sure, from top left to bottom right:
---
Apricot, Honey Butter, Mudmetal, Midnight Ice
---
The first 3 dictate the overall brownish color of the jackal body, while the last one dictates the eyes color. Suit yourself.
---
You missed the part about the character being 7 years old.
---
Are you playing on a free to play account or did you buy the expansions too?
---
FFXIV has (a few) race and job triggers.
---
I'm sure if they can manage it, so can GW2.
---
I have often suggested a "Rebirth" token that you would be able to buy or earn. If it was a gemstore item, it would be cheaper than a new character slot, something around 400 gems, or enough gems to cost around 100 gold.
---
Using it would reset your race and it would wipe all story progress, but keep everything else: Profession, inventory, build and unlocked skills and traits, map completion, recipes discovered in crafting disciplines, time played, deaths, etc.
---
In before C O  N  T E N T
---
How about no more chairs. Way to many and they are no longer special. "Just another chair"
---
That was the only "useful" information you can take away from the video: spirits shards are worth something. It's almost equivalent to me saying dungeon tokens are worth more than people think.
---
Having said that, there are MUCH better resources (MUCH shorter youtube videos inclusive) that teach you how to get started on making gold in GW2. Actual helpful resources, which obviously don't give you specifics - as nobody in their right mind would do that, unless they are quitting the game.
---
&gt;and you are an arrogant, condescending asshole. always was, always will be.
---
All true, but oddly, only to people like you. Which, again, says more about you than it does about me.
---
I wish.
---
god forbid you play a video game

Notice the word "usually"?  10mins of content for a few extra evenings isn't great.  Argue if you want, but for vets there isn't crazy amounts of content in the ls releases.
---
You know, i frequent a lot of unassociated forums and the question "what is your top 5, top 10, top 3 etc game ever" and i always forget GW1 but i honestly would put it up there in my top 3....such a perfect MMO Hybrid (i don't know if it has another acronym that fits, i've never thought of it as a proper MMO in the modern sense). The story flowed so well in the way the game was designed, i can often feel modern MMOs have so much to do and so much going on that the story in them can become a bit disjointed, or you can lose your way but GW1 got it spot on.  
---
I'd love to go back to GW1 and do some more hall of monuments stuff but i wouldn't even know where to start now :(
---
I‚Äôd love to, but support are taking their sweet time about getting back to me :(
---
Join a guild that does WvW frequently (/r/gw2recruitment) and play anything other than thief, ranger or mesmer, preferably necro because of the AOE.
---
I think if you mention that you weren't able to get the episode because of x reason they could help.
---
I love how one of the people in this video is a know Gold buyer and another one is a known gold seller.
---
Pretty crazy that names have a chance to cause DB issues, means they're probably relying on their uniqueness somewhere and keying off character name instead of just an independent unique ID
---
As I said on a previous comment, "usually" done in two evenings.  Dragonfall had more substance for sure.  Also, I don't think anything is horrendous, maybe read what I wrote instead of just putting words in my mouth.
---
Crafting skills, why is that a problem, he is not deleating the character so he can craft with the one he have and still make a new character. 
---
And bag slots, yeah sure he will have to get new bags. A few days of farming gold and then he have that too.
---
? I dont get anything when I log in.
---
It's also just more fun than Serpents...
---
To be honest, this really just shows how unfinished underwater combat is. It is in more of a beta than a finished product.
---
This can also be shown how, UW-combat has worse balance of skills, less skills overall available, and how legendary weapons are no longer being produced for UW-combat.
---
This is most likely a major reason why Anet has never used spears for a normal combat weapon like the Paragon in GW1.
---
But in typical Anet fashion they fail to realize that those "play today" trailers are made for the shock factor and very little is known before hand about what that team was working on. Teasing and having a release date for it already set is absolutely pointless imo
---
If you've seen what they pay, you'd wonder if they had any to begin with.
---
no because between seasons they shuffled their teams around, which takes time until teams are settled etc. They dont have to do that between every future episode.
---
well it doesn't just gift the mount to you in the mail, you unlock the story steps you need to begin the skyscale quest. if you've logged in at all in the last few months you've already unlocked the story.
---
You lost the point. He still have his 7 years one and now a new one as well who will give him birthday gifts every year.
---
Well underwater combat got a lot better. Remember all your attacks being obstructed for god knows what reason or mobs randomly resetting, turning invulnerable and healing but still attacking you ? That being said, it's still a shitshow so I'm really glad we're not going for bubbles next.
---
The pattern from ANET so far as been to push the best part of birthday rewards to be once-per-account unlocks. Probably worth keeping your oldest character around to keep getting those, but it's less important to keep a bunch of older characters for the dyes unless there's a really expensive one that you want. Most of the dyes after the third birthday are relatively cheap except for the most recent 7th birthday dyes (which are in the hundreds)
---
clickbait title
---
What the hell did I just watch?

Unlockable emote that‚Äôs fucking awesome

Hahahahahahaaa like we'd actually get new hairstyles. *cries in Sylvari*
---
  Patch size \~805mb
---
No excuse for it and you know it. Clean off your knees they're filthy.
---
Are you guys kidding me. Are you sitting and messure the length of the patch notes and then make comments about that???
---
I mean you start to sound like very old people who complain about the apples in the store or other unintersting things. Like really all of you need to get over your self this is beyond ridicolus, get out of the old man/woman and get in to the game and play it instead.
---
Patch size about 850MB, playable at around 110MB.
---
One can hope D:
---
They have updated after 2 weeks before. If fluctuates but normally coincides with larger content/festival patches, which re not evenly spaced
---
879 mb patch size
---
Patch size: \~774MB
---
**Patch size:** 845 MB
---
Looks like there are 2 100 MB files at that end...
---
So is the first strike mission already ingame now or what? And since when are shitty map events promoted as "content"?
---
Oh yeah I forgot changenotes was how we accurately measured a release!!!
---
&gt; Disabled the Glyph of Reaping in instances for players who are not instance owners. 
---
WTF!?! - Worst fix ever - only reason I bought glyph on my alt accounts
---
C'mon Anet - get your shit together
---
Weird, mine said 820MB (English language only).

Cronos Dage is stepping out some moves, some sweet dance moves.

Anyone else having trouble DLing? Getting stuck at 0kb/s at some points.
---
Remember what Blizzard turned into when old guard left?
---
Better lube your arseholes, because we're about to get fucked in the long run.
---
I mean, I get it, but the one sentence "Bound by Blood is now live" kinda has more weight to it than the gigantic list of gemstore updates.
---
Would you rather them list out:
---
A new map has been added with x new adventures, x new hearts, x new instances, x characters with x lines of new dialogue, x new achievements with x new armor/weapon skins, etc.
---
Or would you rather just see: New content is live. Go check it out!
---
And the epilogue of war eternal
---
With Icebrood Saga, after wheel taken over back by ncsoft, this was to be expected. And it's only a beginning.
---
Patch Notes:
---
Imperator Bangar Ruinbringer learns the Pact to party as only Charr can.
---
Yeah, good follow-up for the apotheosis we just went through in the LS4 finale. Hoping they answer some questions at least.
---
ironically, this is a very old hairstyle that you used to only be able to get through a glitch. i think it's available on the chinese client or something? but definitely not new lol :/
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/76298/game-update-notes-may-14-2019
---
I'm not sure why you are expecting more. The War Eternal story patchnotes are also pretty short.
---
Guild Wars 2 patch notes tend not to go into great detail about maps, events, story beats or encounters. I can't recall more detail regarding story releases being the norm recently.
---
Since 2012 when the game came out
---
Dont you dare ruin iiiitttt, its *new* for us!
---
It's not that you don't think it's important, but the fact that THEY don't think it's important enough to not elaborate on it. The person is saying they are so driven on gemstore sales and hyping it that they are almost forgetting they have a living story to work on. Excuse me, it's not story anymore. It's SAGA.
---
Are you guys ready for 10 minutes of story and 3 mini games sold as content followed by waiting another 4 months for the next episode? At least we will get a gem store update every two weeks.. Wow guys look, a new mount skin pack for only 2k gems! Now that's quality content!
---
Not until we can actually dye the "mount" chairs. I'm not really interested in just having a generic mount pop out.
---
I'm still working on my Skyscale but I'm almost done. New content will have to wait till this weekend.
---
expansion level content right here
---
Big update, hyped for a week \[kinda\] and most of the notes are "look at the gem store/loot box stuff guys!!"
---
805 for me
---
Hopefully it'll update with episode 1...?
---
Well you found it cringey, I found it fun and entertaining. So... That's why. Different audiences, different views.
---
Character select background and music still the same? Can't log in atm
---
Mods, please remove this thread from the subreddit, as per point 5 of our Rules. It‚Äôs low effort
---
Will you take your common sense and get out of here, please?
---
Oh dear :(
---
Sad but true.
---
Will you ever stop deepthroating anet?
---
And the magazine said content was coming in the prologue.
---
Can someone please post pics of the Golden Talon Longbow Skin and  Primal Spirit Jackal Skin?
---
Thanks in advance.
---
That has never really been the case.
---
Check the patch notes for War Eternal.
---
No bullet points about the story beats, no bullet points about the flying through the mists on Aurene. No teasers about the battle with Kralkatorrik. Or features in the map. Or the events. Or the upgradeable armor collections.
---
Only mounts and legendaries tend to get separate sections as the rest is often left for player discovery.
---
Mods, please remove this comment from the removed thread on the subreddit, as per point 5 of our rules.  It's low effort.
---
Like 2-3 months since last patch and nothing of substance...
---
I'm not a programmer but my best guess is that it was difficult to program. Just a hunch.
---
Community reaction to every and anything is getting more toxic it seems. Its hard to be excited for anything in this sub.
---
That learned from ffxiv
---
The first page of your comment history shows four hits for white knight. The first four pages have 18 hits.
---
Maybe you lack the cringe gene. I definitely felt it.
---
She's the one who "Takes care" of anyone who mentions Cantha.
---
Now what am I supposed to read while in class? &gt;:(
---
Thanks! I call it, the "Spooky Boi." Frighten your enemies away.   
---
It works best in PvE, not so great on boss like enemies who ignore the fear effect obviously.
---
That was so fucking dumb.
---
I kind of like it.
---
Yeah it's not magic, and I'm not a programmer or game designer but they should figure out a way to fix this for real not some crappy workaround. They sold this item to do a thing, and now it can't do that thing anymore.
---
it's pain i the a\*\* when you have that glyhp and you are invited too someones home instances and you have to visit each node...its not fixing proplem at all, just pretending there isn't any problem
---
Pretty much the same length of story patch notes as All or Nothing;
---
"As her allies fortify themselves for the final confrontation with Kralkatorrik, Aurene prepares to face her greatest fear: her role in Tyria's future."
---
Long and detailed patchnotes for story related releases isn't the norm with Anet.
---
Majority of the old guard has since long left.
---
The game is in a huge content drought.
---
This makes him an... Unnatureling then, right?
---
Would love for unlockable emotes to be a new thing going forward as minor collection rewards and such.
---
Second option requires you to have the game installed and ready just to have the knowledge of what's new. Doesn't look very effective outside the active playerbase.
---
You can always leave if you don't like it. Saves you time and nerves.
---
Does all the fear count as CC for break bars though?
---
Yes, I notice that. However the complaints are about the length of the story component, which is baseless as Anet have never included detailed notes for the story.
---
At most you get a bit of extra fluff about things like legendaries or fractals.
---
Some people sit down but I prefer to sit up.
---
What no picture of said mount? For shame. At least post a pic of the new mount for those of us not at home since I've not seen what it looks like yet.
---
I always think my best unlocks come from free keys. Also, on the day off the update. I know this is just superstition but...
---
Viper's for PvE, Celestial (I think) for WvW, Sage for PvP
---
Why didn't they say the same about BLC? They added the preview option in game after all. Just login and check it out 4Head
---
Men the nostalgia. the band playing reminded me so hard of FoS‚Äôs heeding the call back in GW1
---
Whelp, they've literally never done that, so idk what to tell you other than this is yet another hysterical "daed gaem, gemstore baed" thread.
---
Isn't the trailer the patch notes now though? Released day of and pretty mich goes over the features. Seems like a  acceptable substitute. Though I miss the more hypey trailers.
---
what weapon are you using?
---
Am i the only one clicking the chest while watching the video?
---
Which is the case with the majority of patches. There was a teaser for the armor in War Eternal posted on Twitter and other social media. There was no mention of this in the patch notes.
---
big update lads ! just look at all those black lion updates ! content !
---
You can unlock a /rockout headbanger emote. That's a start?
---
Release trailers are a very common thing in gaming. We're used to trailers a week early for GW2, but that's not the industry norm. You generally want to build hype when people can actually go buy the content.
---
Just because this trailer is off-beat doesn't mean it's not for a general audience. It makes it clear it's a celebration event, I think the general public understands what a celebration is.
---
Ok I love it. I don't know if this trailer is good at all for actually attracting people to the game, but for me it was hysterical.
---
It does. What I meant by "ignore the fear effect" is that they don't actively move away from you like lesser enemies do. It still helps breakdown CC bars.
---
[Here you are!](https://imgur.com/a/5PyfAC9)
---
Basically core engineer and power or condition holo are identical underwater as on land (core swaps flamethrower to rocketboots and mortar kit to supply turret crate, condi holo swaps flamethrower to laser disk), cause of all the kit swapping and cause you still have access to photon forge. Power holo is like the previously meta holo-rifle build except a harpoon gun instead of a rifle. I got 13.3K dps underwater on the honor of the waves boss compared to 2nd best at 2.6K dps. Nobody was really giving each other boons to speak of
---
B A R O Q U E
---
Well, until someone actually does figure out a fix and gets it to work consistently, this is what we get. "Just figure it out" is not helpful feedback because it is never that simple.
---
Awesome stuff!
---
You only brought the glyph to use in other players home insurances?
---
Hope its just a bug.but if you added how to dance to  your wardrobe before the patch you cant use the erstes!
---
They literally did a whole magazine about it.
---
Nothing rushed with this prologue, nothing at all.
---
Their core audience is officially people who support Korean f2p tier cosmetics and yiff furries I guess. 
---
I honestly couldn‚Äôt sell anyone I know on this game based on this trailer.
---
I would have liked to see maybe highlighting some features in a way that gets me excited about what is in store for me.  There exists a form of patch notes between what we have and what you listed.
---
Why not highlight that strike missions have arrived and have a brief description of what to expect?  Why not name drop a few of those minigames in the patch notes that we've been teased?  Why not mention a defining feature of this new map we get to explore? If there are weapon and armor skins,  why not mention they exist?
---
Why jackal? üò´ I like my fox
---
Drytop or Silverwastes
---
If you get POF you get HOT for free!
---
You mean server time? Well that's 5am PST for me so convert it.
---
And give people more reason to complain? The responses in this thread should tell you all you need to know about it.
---
(It certainly wouldn't bother me, and certainly makes *sense*, but you know that if there are two things that people like to hate on, it's gem store stuff and things that kids might possibly have the audacity to be enjoying in Fortnite.)
---
I bet you're a blast at parties
---
You can almost gauge the toxicity increase with Anet's ever increasing focus on Gem Store and merchandise rather than the actual game.
---
its not a bug its intended
---
Ah, I loved that event! Good memories.
---
That's the problem server time and tyria time are different. so the next event for me is 14:00 tyria time. which would mean 21 hours from now.
---
But have you checked new Black Lion stuff? That content is working just fine.
---
Blood Rubies, Petrified Wood, and Jade Frags have a cap. Winterberry Bushes, Fire Orchids, Orrian Oysters don't.
---
They patched the ascended plants so that they could not be shared, so visitors could not harvest them directly. However, Glyph of Reaping was still able to harvest them indirectly if the visitor harvested a normal plant.
---
So, owner plants 1 normal plant and 11 ascended plants, and visitors use Glyph of Reaping on the 1 normal plant to receive 11 ascended plants too.
---
On my computer I usually run into the tree before they show up =-/

More chairs.  I need better sits for my characters.

Yeah I gotcha I just saw an opportunity for a guillotine meme and I took it.
---
Despite the fact that everything further away than a few meters fades to nothingness (even on highest settings) there are holes in the landscape and floating assets in the distance everywhere.
---
Carry a stack of Candy Corn.
---
Why do you need patch notes about a story that you can go experience immediately?
---
Just go play the dang game. The gem store stuff needs to be explained a bit because people would like to know more about what they're paying for if they choose to buy things. The story is free and much better experienced than explained.
---
No there hasn't been gear progression beyond Ascended/ Legendary in terms of Power Creep.
---
Yes...That's what I'm telling the person who's getting upset about the glyph change no longer working for him....
---
Buy Gem Store content and then get excited for next Gem Store Content
---
The gear/level progression has been replaced by masteries which is kind of a horizontal progression that grants new skills and capabilities to your character. It's pretty long if you want to max it.
---
Since GW1 Factions release, is the earliest I remember seeing it.
---
Horizontal vs. vertical progression was one of the main tenets and selling points of the game. The level cap is still 80 and as far as they've indicated that will never change.
---
They fixed Mac client, all other things are meaningless to me.
---
and the Inquest/Risen mobs with longass evades without any sort of animation or indicator
---
Kung Lao cossplay in 3...2...1...
---
Oh the irony.
---
I like the idea that we have this for 2 weeks then on the 1st of October we get halloween which lasts still November 1st and we get episode 1. Well a man can dream.

---
Most of their LS trailers are not for outsiders.
---
Im a returning player. I havent even started.
---
I would guess the main point against it is animations. A crossbow is handled differently than a bow. We have a slingshot as a bow skin and the animations kind of work there. I could imagine a crossbow to work better as a pistol or rifle skin. Thief with a one hand-crossbow would definitely look cool.
---
ah yes, "preserving the surprise" for a playerbase that would just flock to a dulfy guide to walk them through everything
---
Glyphs of the Reaping are disabled in Guild Halls
---
I was getting worried when upping my settings didn't really fix it, but maybe I'm not the only one with this problem.
---
Already had problems with some of the NPCs voice acting, cut off mid sentence once and two had the text bubble but no sound. This being in the first instance when you can listen to the crowd before leaving it.
---
&gt; but unfortunately we have no way to follow all these details.
---
That way is learning English, the de-facto international language in both the Internet and most of the world.
---
Lmao wut? How in gods name is what you responded to toxic?
---
Yeah ... this game is still not for delusional people that needs to lie to themselves.
---
I think it's sad how the actual game changes gets like 6 lines of text, but the black lion gemstore crap is more than 60% of the post...
---
feels like they're underselling the content bit.
---
No vertical progression. So u can Just stop and come back
---
I want that hat as single piece
---
No surprise pikachu?

Lol I thought this trailer was fanastic.

It's bad even on the highest settings.

It's a bit of a bummer and I hope they fix this

Can you actually figure out where to go on your own? I liked the core game jp's, but the later ones werent really focused on the jumping, but on figuring out where to jump. I hated that change in design. Especially ember bay is ridiculous.
---
&gt;Some stuff just won't work
---
actually it does if you have people who know what they are doing. It's not magic as you said.
---
The roller beetle race is fun too.
---
Off topic, is it just me or are several of the NPC Charr voiced by Braham's actor?
---
Dual crossbows, racing scarf and a hood.
---
We demon hunters now

I hire this guy at work for people to remember having fun is forbidden.
---
This game. 
---
Has gone really far downhill.
---
I‚Äôm all for fun lighthearted stuff. But wow.
---
This is a trailer for the beginning of a new saga! 
---
It shouldn‚Äôt be this tacky. It‚Äôs cute in the way wildstar was cute. I hated wildstar and it‚Äôs now shutdown.
---
This trailer says hay I‚Äôm a trash mmo that will sell you cosmetics. 
---
Gw2 is actually one of the most fun you can have in a mmorpg so it really hurts to see them treat the game like this. 
---
I‚Äôm sad
---
Anyone know when they were going to release build templates. Thought I heard those were coming w/ the new LW season.
---
If only they'd learn minis, mounts...
---
&gt;get in to the game and play it instead
---
you can;t play gem store skins
---
Just a quote from FFXIV's recent expansion trailer.
---
Does loading 3 come in higher resolution?  I need that as my background now
---
because that's what patch notes are. if you don't want to read them, then...don't..read...them?
---
Nah they need to sell those. :(
---
The sub seems to assume that because something breaks or doesn't work as intended it must mean that the development team is incompetent and has no idea how to do their jobs. Clearly we should just keep firing and hiring better people that we pull from the aether.
---
it was everywhere in the GW1 beta weekends.
---
The game is skill based, not gear. Its piss easy to get best gear but to execute the rotation and know your build is what its all about if you are looking into endgame
---
That'd be pretty hard to do for current content.
---
Same, dialogue kept cutting out.
---
yikes
---
A Dulfy guide huh? 
---
I got some bad new for you...
---
&gt; I have been playing since pre-launch and do not remember this at all. 
---
He had a pretty average experience.  You may need to get your memory checked  it seems faulty.
---
&gt; You will never make a video because you are wrong and you know it.
---
I'll never make a video because you're an actual moron with no reading comprehension and I have nothing to prove to somebody who's already admitted that they haven't bothered to practise something and are still trying to claim that it's impossibly difficult despite that, to somebody who said that *if you practise* then you'll find actually, it's not hard at all.
---
Away with you, it'll be your bedtime soon.
---
oh is this one of those "I'm only pretending to not understand the point you were trying to make?" bits
---
yea i was briefly excited(for like 2s) when i saw the new rifle and thought we finally get crossbows
---
such a wasted opportunity for skin variety indeed
---
I know none cares and I willbe downvoted to hell but spvp qs are not working.
---
Uhm. I guess the light tone is fine, but I'm really not a fan of stylizing all the informational text. It's not really "fun", just looks more amateurishly gaudy and less... professional.
---
I guess there will be translations in Portuguese, when Brazil gets powerful enough.
---
As for Europe, don't all countries at this point teach another obligatory foreign language?
---
Refusing to acknowledge complaints and concerns under the belief that those sharing them want nothing but hatred for the game and not, y'know, what they think might be improvements to it is just as toxic as refusing to acknowledge any positive feedback because you think anyone sharing *that* is some sort of blind, gullible shill.
---
It is possible to disagree with a post while still respecting the opinion the post holds. "The community is toxic" as a response to an opinion you don't happen to share is functionally the same as "I don't like opinions that aren't mine."
---
If you've genuinely got a belief that the community is becoming toxic, address it in your own post and be prepared for whatever agreement or disagreement it might get, don't parasitize a popular post to get your opinion more eyes than you're afraid it would get in /new.
---
&gt;Would you rather them list out:
---
&gt;A new map has been added with x new adventures, x new hearts, x new instances, x characters with x lines of new dialogue, x new achievements with x new armor/weapon skins, etc.
---
Yes. I guess I am used to the level of detail of FFXIV patch notes though. I mean [these are patch notes for a small 0.05 update](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/b6083dbda4e9497698b64163ffc8cee52472b81a)
---
Guild Wars 2 has never been about a vertical treadmill where your gear is lowered and must be replaced.  Ascended gear is still the highest stat-wise, and Legendary is the most functional because it can be stat swapped on demand.  I have a hard time believing you've max out ascended gear, as that takes a bit of work to craft and collect all the items.  Not to mention, only recently has legendary gear been finalized where you can get all weapons, armor, runes, sigils, and trinkets as legendaries, so I know you've not completed that.
---
That said, there are a few verticals in the game:
---
* Fractals requires you to grind upwards through the levels to unlock all 100 levels and you need to accumulate 135 or more agony resist on your equipment. You can also grind to unlock certain unlimited abilities.
---
* You can also up-tweak your equipment with stat-based infusions, though that gets expensive quick.  But, you'd actually have higher stats than most people.
---
Guild Wars 2 is really about horizontal scaling, where you unlock character and account-wide abilities.  That includes character specific skills, skills unique to certain maps, and account-wide abilities.  And, if you're been gone for a few years, you've got a lot to catch up.
---
Literally NO living world release has a lot about that release in their patch notes...imagine that it would be...spoilers..?
---
Honestly quite excited for unlockable emotes, FFXIV regularly adds new emotes and I think it's a neat extra feature, GW2 always felt really limited for emotes.
---
That doesn't mean everyone is fluent, especially the younger players.
---
They sometimes sell gem store-only minis for the tickets, so there's that
---
FFXIV manages to keep spoilers out, while revealing a great level of detail in their patch notes.
---
That rifle looks fantastic
---
Probably because so many people are trying to download it at the same time
---
Learning english is more cost/time efficient
---
oh shit i got both today from the supply drop's keys. i didn't even know the longbow was new.
---
That is correct, they did not rush it. 4 months means they either have a really ineffective structure (too many fucking artists) or are heavily understaffed.
---
Lots of top-end minis tanked in price because they were added to the mini tickets. If they add the rooster, then its price would bottom out.
---
I just flew from Dalada Forest Waypoint to the west and flew over 2 or 3 events. Before that, I had seen 2 farther south (I think) shortly after ooze pit ended.
---
That's some shit to learn.  How does a company making millions in profit pay talent so low?  It's like Anet is trying hard to force senior devs to look at other employment so they can hire college grads at the lowest base salary.
---
New account with low effort post.
---
¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Same comment every update now. When will people understand that the gem store notes are very detailed to the last pixel while game notes aren't because we're supposed to play. If notes were as precise for the episode, they'd be a kilometer long.
---
 [Visual Patch Notes.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ckxtvpljpyc)
---
More of the same, what did you expect?
---
thx
---
When it comes to crossbows, I wish they would have had them in place of shortbows. Like the distinction between longbow and shortbow just feels so negligible and somewhat odd that there would be different skills between the two (as in the case of Ranger), whereas the structure and build of a crossbow seems like it could make more sense on why the attacks would be different.
---
Who has a screenshot of this one? Stuck at work and I'm really hoping its what I'm expecting.
---
[&amp;AgEbZwEA] 	Frying Pan
---
... just don't use that one glyph? You can still harvest everything.
---
Yeah I had the same issue with Kas's voice not speaking but the text bubble was up. I re-entered the black citadel and it worked perfectly fine the 2nd time
---
Voice acting a great, gameplay...
---
There is a clock setting in the game settings to switch it to server time from local time.  I usually have this on server time for event tracking.  The gw2 wiki has also been good lately at including event timers in their more recent event pages.
---
I was going back and forth on this one. On the initial playthrough of the first episode it sounds like she's totally different, but on another playthrough I think it's just that she's got a different style (much less film-noir than before), but I'm leaning towards the VA is the same. The lack of the film-noir style definitely makes her sound super different, though.
---
Usually they don‚Äôt put story stuff in the patch notes.
---
No there isn't. There isn't much horizontal progression either unless you like collecting cosmetics.
---
This game is about skill progression
---
I'll never learn to fly like that :c
---
A nice little detail, that they did add that effect to griffon.
---
Skill based game with content so east you can mash 1 and win
---
Ding ding ding. Like most corporate jobs I've worked.
---
Put yourself in the shoes of a potential new player who has no idea there even was any kind of teaser reveal and then ask yourself that question again
---
but the reason I bought the glyph was to use it.
---
Oh wow
---
Black lion chest seems to be good now, eh?
---
Sometimes I wished they would have given us these impressive skins in the form of in-game Legendary achievements.
---
That was awful.
---
RIP GW2
---
They should break it into subsections by LW season and expansions.
---
So a new player who has no idea of the concept of living world releases, follows absolutely no social media for the game, and yet reads the patch notes?
---
Could be either really. One of the sylvari story lines involves seeing a white stag. :)
---
Of course you can lern it. Its actually just the common dash I use here :)
---
Balance patch?
---
GW1 was unique and many if us veterans feel GW2 was too different and not a true sequel. Fun, sure don't get me wrong, but lost a lot of the features that made GW special.
---
Lost all GW1-related titles, not bad!
---
Game crashed when changing back item skin to the new banner of the ash legion
---
Any guild hall decorations?
---
yawn
---
it's really pathetic how they make us wait the normal living world episode period for 10 minutes of dialog and then dare calling that expansion level content, anet never fails to disappoint
---
And not to the website announcing the living world?
---
I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs an escort meta with a boss? Is that this one or something else? Maybe Path to Ascension-esc? I‚Äôm so excited to dive in and see all the new events, esp if they are taggable.
---
I have just one free character slot left for key farming. Cannot waateit for a race change
---
KotH, Annihilation (elimination), reverse CTF (similar to KotH), TDM with a proper map, Tug-of-War conquest would all work well with GW2 combat, ToW would actually require very little effort to make for Anet too, but won't happen
---
If it wouldn't lead to mass DCs, this event would be perfect. Game crashed for several ppl 24 sec before the last song ended at 400%. Noone got the achievement, nor the chests
---
There's an error in this comment. It presumes that people making memes on the Guild Wars 2 subreddit actually read books and not just spend their time complaining.
---
(please don't burn me at the stake, I'm only being slightly serious)
---
I got more than a weapon skin drop I sent to main account by mail
---
That jackel got me pumped!!
---
The "elitist" branding fallacy triggers me to no end. Sometimes I get the feeling most people don't even know what elitist means.
---
This was by far one of the best things Anet has ever done. Hats off.
---
The pendulum will swing again. People are just on a negative kick right now, it's happened before.
---
true :v
---
It's a better system for them for two major reasons  
---
1. It allows them to focus on big ticket rewards instead of smaller, less exciting utility rewards like the dyes or booster  
---
2. It lets them side step the obvious benefit attributed to people who made a ton of alts all at the same time and make it more about your general account age which is how many other games do it (or total sub time)
---
what has this game become lmao
---
Can't give them more kudos, this might be the most excitingly fun thing I've done in the open world game. Beyond hype for the Saga now if this is the standard they are setting with the prologue!
---
Yes, pressing F and /dance and /salute until done should be enough to satisfy players until next episode ;) /s
---
First there was a progress bar, and then another.
---
And then another.
---
10/10 open world event
---
It was amazing and the say chat went crazy :D &lt;3 loved it! Thanks anet :)
---
It's got new  textures all over the place + reused ones. Trees, blood metal structures, aurene crystals, new(?) ascalonian statues, ...
---
I'm quite new to reddit, but doesn't the stuff that doesn't contribute get up voted
---
Thank you so much~
---
Those shoulders are reallllly nice
---
The Ember Bay one isn't a JP, it's exploiting vanilla WoW style. Except not fun.
---
Learn English. It's not a hard language.
---
Verdant Brink is especially fun to fly through.
---
Well, I just participated in the rock concert event in the new map with about a hundred other players, and all the comments from them were how fun it was and that it was a great event.  Don't let the negativity get you down, some people just like to be outraged on the internet.  In-game it's a different story.
---
I thought it was like this forever? Pretty sure mine had those effects before.
---
Microphone warhorn skin, hah
---
What, specifically, do you not understand about what he did?
---
this shity glyphs is only useful in guild halls and home instances, but instead of fixing the problem with farming the ascended mats from other people home, they just deactivated it all together, that's classic Anet for you
---
No, that's precisely why it's fallacious. It doesn't *imply* anything.
---
It's a useful tool that can help us to streamline our search for the cause by looking in areas where there *seems* to be a relationship, but that's the limit to it's use.
---
Many things have relationships, and that is precisely why we need to first *investigate*. Not make assumptions based on mere correlation, and driven by biases.
---
Of course it is. You're not the instance owner! Silly billy.
---
I play on max settings and it's just as bad. This pop in is absurd
---
They need to add a lfg button on the map and it would take you to the closest equivalent lfg category to the map your on.
---
Maybe a small preview of the people in lfg when you click it too.
---
Should also be able to click a dungeon on the map to open a lfg for that dungeon. Same thing for the champion boards too.
---
According to below, its an axe. Now mirage can be weird too
---
No, you can get the other basic 3 (springer, skimmer, and jackal) by completing the necessary hearts and buying them from the vendors (similar to what you did for the raptor inside the story instance). The story does provide mastery points and experience which is helpful. You have to train the previous mounts to certain levels before you can do the heart of the next mount (at least for Jackal).
---
Griffon - I don't remember if you have to finish the story, but it definitely helps because you have to access areas all over the core PoF maps to unlock it.
---
Roller Beetle - You need to complete part of the living story episode and complete the necessary achievements to unlock it.
---
Skyscale - You need to have access to all the Living Story Season 4 maps and complete various achievements to unlock.
---
&gt; toxic 
---
Off to the favorite buzzwords of guilty. Are you going to give us &lt;weary stare&gt; as well?
---
The game is already approaching 50gb, and you want them to bloat the file size even more?
---
I agree. I get the appeal of kudzu, and the golden talon bow there is pretty neat looking.. but pharus is by far the best looking longbow, in my opinion.
---
I have the shrine guardian but those footfalls of the new stag are a whole new level.
---
You can get till jackal mount without completing the PoF story, Springer and skimmer would be easy and would need you to master raptor till level 3, but jackal would require at least Springer or skimmer mastery level 3 + more trade contacts.
---
Griffon requires you to complete PoF storyline and is locked behind a collection which costs 250g, roller beetle has collection which requires living world season 4  episode 3  and sky scale require you to have all living world season 4 maps and a long time gated collection.
---
Find a way to exploit it being disabled for a small gold gain, and watch ANet warp the timespace to fix it as soon as inhumanely possible.
---
It's only a problem if it affects company's profits.
---
Feels a lot like Black Desert Online
---
Is there a challenge mode? Whats the difference between going in with a group and joining in randomly?
---
they said so before releasing...what did you expect? they are supposed to be 10 man instanced content of easy access and a stepping stone for raids. i'm guessing they specifically made to be pugged quite easily
---
Nope, griffon never got it. Only skyscale and skimmer.   
---
You can see the old, non-effect flying here: [https://youtu.be/cDS6D8vdoF0?t=56](https://youtu.be/cDS6D8vdoF0?t=56)
---
Did you expect anything else from content aimed to story players? They have learned with HoT that they dont want challenging content.
---
I got lucky with the golden black lion chest key I got from the supply drop and got it lol
---
Now I can definitely say it was worth it :D
---
Ooh, legendary mounts, now that would be an interesting idea. I'd love in-game reward mount skins, WoW had some amazing ones and it's something extra to work towards.
---
You should be dancing, yeah.
---
You overestimate the average player.
---
Now I'm always ready to call out ANet on their numerous lazy decisions, like any reasonable person, but I wouldn't say they got lazy with legendaries in general. Yeah, *Pharus* is lazy as shit, Sharur isn't as amazing visually as the others, but except them each and every gen2 legendary has been a visual and/or lore treat. There are some bad eggs in the bunch, but the rest is fine.
---
Too bad the process of getting all of them past initial 4 has been braindead grind and goldsink, but you can't have everything.
---
Yeah but for WoW those employees left before Classic.  The point is, companies have employees leave and it doesn't mean the end is near.
---
&gt; Gw2 hasn't delivered anything worth mentioning in years  
---
See this is the type of statement I find ridiculous.  In the last 2 years they released a full expansion, a full living world story with lots of new maps, 8 new mounts, 4 new raids, 2 Fractals, festivals, etc. and are just about to release the Icebrood Saga.  Haven't released anything worth mentioning in years?  This is the type of hyperbole I'm talking about.  I want to know what the future holds just as much as you do but let's be a bit more rational in our criticism.
---
It's always adorable when you can spot the people who have not only never played any other mmo other than GW2 but don't even read basic news about the other games but still try to speak on the subject
---
No it wouldn't. If you change the espec, your weapon skills simply are disabled. But for racial armor the *skin* is the problem. If you change espec, you weapon is still in your hand and visible. 
---
If you wear racial armor and switch from Norn to Asura, it would be a horrible mess. It's not just an "Asura in Norn armor", the whole design is different, clipping points are different, some aren't even there, others are too many, it would literally end up in a pile of meshed textures.
---
which version did you enter?
---
according to that interview there should be a premade entry and a get tossed together entry
---
This is no different from the release notes they've given out since pre-HoT. Even the PoF release had very few details in the patch notes
---
&gt; They patched the ascended plants so that they could not be shared, so visitors could not harvest them
---
And why not? This is the main problem in my view in the first place.
---
Maybe you should finish the story.
---
Where is this strike mission?
---
Yeah, the key to flying with griffin after the ‚Äúnerf‚Äù is just not using the space bar to pull up.
---
Neglecting all other required ingredients, 25 of the new chili (map currency) per food item is way too high
---
Don't insult fractals, please.
---
Hard to tell because my inventory was cluttered from the living story, but essentially just a lot of garbage, that you ussually get from a world boss or such, opal shard, opal orbs, champ bags, that sort of thing. But some guy in my group got a pauldron chest - ebohawke something.
---
Also if you finish the encounter fast enough you get extra loot, which we did, first try. Just sad all around.
---
250 of every map currency to make a legendary chair
---
There's basically four mini-metas on the map. There's a lot of random events too in between the metas.
---
Software development is weird.  I've seen far too many projects where my first thought is "it's easy, just do XYZ".  However, when I go to actually implement it, it turns out to actually be a month of work for really stupid reasons.  This happens often enough that the conventional wisdom for estimating projects is to take your actual estimate and double it (or more), and estimate/budget overruns are still incredibly common.  So yeah, either every single dev on the planet is a lazy, incompetent asshole, or maybe programming is harder than you think.
---
I just tried to solo it. Made it to 50% with a subotimal build and died to timelimit. With a bit of prepaparation it is probably even soloable. Def clearably with 2 people.
---
I really love this skin. So cool.
---
Probably meant hatch chili peppers like the ones in New Mexico
---
a literal fake news post
---
Soutwest corner of the new map, you need to finish the story first tho, or at least the squad leader has to.
---
Still, why not have ascended materials be gained that way? I don't see a problem in that.
---
I'll try as soon as possible. Ty
---
FF14 does this with trials, normal-&gt;hard-&gt;extreme. We'll see if Anet can replicate the same success.
---
Especially when asc food exists. Isn't there conc/exp asc food?
---
No 3rd party tools in use.
---
These are my settings [https://imgur.com/46yy1jE](https://imgur.com/46yy1jE)
---
Tried LOD Distance on high, didn't change anything though.
---
Now I know your only motivation for this discussion is to annoy people. Than you, you just played yourself. 
---
Punk.
---
But did you figure out how to get into Recon Cove
---
Boring, yes, but that's one of the most effective ways to teach someone a complicated skill. Start with the basics, slowly add more to the pile. Learn addition and subtraction, then multiplication and division, then exponents and operations, and on and on.
---
The key is to make all previous iterations available for 'review' (or maybe make the increased difficulties require completion of lower difficulties, e.g. fractals). 
---
Honestly, if ANet can work this out, these strikes really *would* be the perfect introductions to difficult mechanics and raids.
---
"I've never known that I had so little fun playing the game."
---
- avid fan enjoying himself making the mistake to look into a "fan" forum
---
They said the boss will evolve during the stories
---
I swear they mentioned this on guild chat agessssssssss ago when Joel was explaining how the griffon worked
---
thx new Dulfy
---
These are just instanced world bosses.  A stepping stone into raids would have been something that atleast needed a comp no matter how poorly it was ran.  Something that atleast provokes a player to think and plan ahead.
---
Yeah this is going great for gw2. 
---
20 dollar mounts. Content releases once every 4-5 months. 
---
It also diluted the character of the game. Shiny things gets people‚Äôs attention so all you well on the cash shop is visual noise 
---
Mounts that make no sense for the game world.
---
Flaming everything 
---
Sparkling everything. 
---
Developers leaving 
---
... what you are left with is a mess that is on its way out
---
Wow. That bow is so cool it makes me consider coming back to the game. As somebody how hasn't played for about 2 years is it worth coming back and is getting this bow realistic?
---
Isn't this what the game is meant to do 1-80? Teach players basic addition?
---
I'm wondering if the spice mix recipe produces 5 of the mix? Sometimes they do weird stuff like that.
---
yes, the eggs benedict
---
Getting tired of seeing Balth every time I log in.
---
Look at my older video - I linked it here in the chat. It wasn't a thing until today.
---
who would have guessed KEKW
---
Yeah, has nothing to do with buying the game. It‚Äôs just that now if you own pof, you get access to hot.
---
But it *is* and has been in a huge content drought for a very long time. It's a simple fact that when sized up against most other popular/mainstream MMOs it takes a very little amount of time and effort to keep up with this game comparatively. Pretty much every single aspect of the game aside from story chapter releases has been stagnating for years.
---
Maybe you can ask support for help.
---
Gotta learn English mate. You aren‚Äôt only getting cut off and left out from the game but also the whole world and news. Its the default international language for communication anyway.
---
There's an event timer on the wiki and I think a lot of people just run them as they pop up. Ls3 metas tend to not attract much attention though.
---
Blue whale maybe
---
I point this out to people all the time , and over half simply don't understand it. They 're the same people that say " My legendary only cost half of what's normal , because I had a lot of the mats." . No , dummy , it cost the same because those mats had value , even in your bank. Then they say " duuuhhhhh."
---
How do you even get in there? I can't find the entrance...
---
I mean. [Sam Riegel](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0726184/) from Critical Role is pretty fucking great! He does the voice of Braham and, from what I've seen so far, a number of the Charr NPC's too.
---
Can't agree more =)
---
Alright come on A-net, you guys gotta chill with the outfits, there is no reason I shouldn't be able to wear that hat independently.
---
Hi, I took that picture -- dyes are (in no particular order): Shy Violet, Enameled Solitude, Night Iris and Deep Lilac.
---
They probably have to do it and no other choice
---
It was pretty great
---
I'm the opposite. I hate the dive to gain speed mechanic for griffon. HATE it. Whereas the skyscale has actual pinpoint control. 
---
I never , ever use my griffon now.
---
Only if you can stack them.
---
Doesn't change the fact that the gemstore has become more intrusive in recent time with the glyphs and exclusive rewards only attainable in blacklion chests. It feels like gw2 is changing for the worse. But hey i have no interest in the update and I'm not gonna play it so it could be that this patch is the exception and it may be packed with unlockables from in game progression. Please let me know if that's the case.
---
you're actually very wrong. pvp rn is incredibly teamfight orientated.
---
the current optimal style of gameplay is pretty much just roll your face on the keyboard at the nearest enemy player and kill them. in fact pvp right now is pretty much team deathmatch with some 1v1s occasionally. 
---
i know its not really a point you covered but ill say it anyway as conquest gets far too much flak. conquest is an immensely challenging and complex gamemode that is *far from boring* - thats not to say there are those who will never find it interesting, but there are far too many players, especially on the official forums who think that conquest is boring without ever having actually ever engaged with the complex aspect of it. sadly right now the balance of the game doesnt allow that to exist but maybe one day it will, and the stale feeling of it all will go away.
---
its fucking tragic tbh
---
Yep. And to add to this. You go in your story journal, go to the chapter you want to play and click "Play this episode". It will direct you to the map during the first mission.
---
Utility aside, these scream future collection quest items
---
This is fine
---
It's set up exactly like the core game's JPs.
---
Sadly, so much effort put into the post that anet will never read and nothing will get added.
---
&gt; What exactly is wrong with that?
---
Nothing. I never said they couldn't like her. They're being assholes and that's not OK. 
---
I can say I don't like you or you don't like me, that's fine. We don't have to force ourselves to like everyone we meet. But I'm not being a bully to you or hateful because of a particular trait that you have that you can't even control.
---
Is it hard tho? I did it on my second try... I guess you get good at it after failing the brisban wildlands one for hours
---
I thought it was full of basement dwelling white knights who attack anyone who says anything negative as toxic.
---
Try doing the story.
---
Landing a mount into one of the smelting machines (which knocks you off your mount by hitting the fire) gets you stuck with mount HUD and unable to do anything without re logging. I repeated it a few times to see if wasn't a one off and it happened every time.
---
Finish the story, it's all there
---
nothing was ever mentioned of being kicked out of the keep, the doors lock, so people cannot enter, there are walls with ramps to jump out if needed, since the enemy team will be able to come kill you if you try and stay without support.
---
Map completion hidden after some event again... thx anet
---
yeah that seems to be how it is, like all past episodes
---
there was a slight implication that owning PoF would be sufficient to play the prologue (even 2 years from now) without unlocking it, but perhaps that ain't the case
---
The one telling the player about all the exciting new content to try is DEFINITELY better from a marketing standpoint. These patchnotes downplay the fact the new living season is live to the point where you could easily miss the fact that it‚Äôs out at all.
---
bounties are way harder than this abomination we got this patch
---
How did you got it (didn't start the ep yet)
---
Were you seriously expecting on par with raids? I think your expectations are too high, these are the baby-steps before the add more and upgrade them. Settle your expectations down a bit bud.
---
Holy crap. Seeing this I now realize why I never completed any of the gryphon-trails ...
---
Thanks for the quality gif :)
---
You know that‚Äôs not the point they were making. The amount of people who actually try to figure out collections and achievements vs just looking up a guide is immense.
---
I don't know the reference, but honestly, it isn't rocket science to understand it!
---
Well, people expected a mobile game so this way they can experience that.
---
Well, this is the Snowflake Saga. There are players in this game that not can afk auto attack.
---
Its just reddit in general sadly. Not sure why but so many of the people here just live in some kind of toxic wasteland i cant imagine. Thankfully all of the other people who have posted here have been very kind and helpful.
---
I mean in terms of difficulty, but yeah I get what you mean.
---
Aaaah just this week I mentioned to my boyfriend that I hoped they would add this some point to the griffon. And they did! Super neat.
---
Not everyone needs materials or wants to get legy gear so they sell what they dont need and then buy something from gem store for example.
---
Absolutely. That release is a smash hit. I'm not sure what to expect from an entire episode, if that's "just" the prologue. November can't come fast enough to find out.
---
it depends on how much you care about taking in the scenery, i suppose.  if you're just speeding from PoI to PoI then i guess mobs aren't that big of a concern, but for me, especially when it's a new map, i like to take it slow, listen to ambient dialogue, angle my camera and look up, and just enjoy the place
---
Ah, right
---
It is nice but don't think I want to go for it since my only other expensive mount skin is already a jackal. Guess I keep my keys until a next chest update.
---
Dat Iron Maiden rip-off font xD.
---
Holy shit what is that patch note. I love it. Now THATS a clearcut presentation to the players of what you've been doing all that time.
---
This makes anet look like amateurs.
---
How's FF? Fun?
---
Why do all the human males in this game look like 13 year old girls with the body of an athlete?
---
You can currently open the gate for people to enter and loot the small chests without keys. Tele to friend also works.
---
That was no prologue, that was an entire episode with the "prologue" label on it
---
AND IT WAS GODDAMN AMAZING
---
Near the iron legion there are 3 charr on a little hill talking about books. They actually got their book club.
---
Ye beforehand I thought it would be terrible but I thoroughly enjoyed it. But more as a one-off thing. Not something I'd want to do daily I think.
---
Remember that starting it will drop huge spoiler bomb. You've been warned
---
When I took out my new chili currency from mat storage it added to my overall Pepper Picker achievement, I have 89 and only had to take out and put back into mat storage twice to get the achievement...I still only have 89 chilis
---
&gt; and I hope they fix this
---
I have some bad news for you.
---
1% xp gain? Isn't all food supposed to have a baseline of 10% exp gain? And what's with the ice cream not granting any XP gain?
---
Never.
---
They had some interesting new events as well not purely focused on regular combat.
---
Like shoo kids of your lawn gave me a good shuckle.
---
Did it with a friend, both of reaper. Boring.
---
I don't think it counts as challenging because you can't find anyone else to join you
---
We're masters of everything! ...Except humility... And acid...
---
...No ones a master of acid...
---
Oh hey it's the "stop having fun" guy.
---
Well, if you're crafting a legendary, you aren't going to be buying Trophy Shipments and selling what comes in them, you're going to be buying Trophy Shipments and keeping them for the legendary.  You'd only sell surplus materials that go on beyond what you need.
---
Using Trophy Shipments to make gold is done when you don't actually immediately need the trophies themselves for other things.
---
First of all seems to me like a lot of people underestimate all the content that comes out with each living world release. Popular opinion is each release has something between 2 - 4 hours of content which isnt true even if you just do the story much less if you do everything else (events / achievements / map rewards). but anyhow 4hrs or 20 hrs obviously at some point you'll do all there is to be done and  then its all about the replayablility. Thats true for any MMO and any release especially dlc sized ones. What happens then? In most its repeat dailies/dungeons for some new weapon / armor set.  That gets old pretty fast, at least it does for me. What about gw2? well lets take say the requiem armour... its probably the most demanding of the season 4 rewards. First you need to get the elegy armor, just a simple collection with a little story It also needs some materials nothing major but then you get to upgrade that to requiem which is where gw2 shinies in my opinion. You have days of activities and its all varied rather then repeating the same daily over and over again. You got some specific events to tackle for the collection, a ton of currencies to get from around the release map as well as currencies you get from all the other season maps and also currencies you need to get by actually doing metas in the heart of torn maps. If you dont have the gold you'll also have to get some but again the beauty of gw2 is you're not forced to repeat the same daily or the same content for that, you can literally do whatever you feel like. Even if it starts feeling a bit  repetitive (lets be honest you need 440  Lump of Mistonium, even if you split that around the different collection and even though you can get that by travelling all around the map mining it and doing hearts and such chances are at some point it will feel grindy but when it does you're free to stop go do sometime else for a while, its all cosmetic, its not a new weapon set you need to be as effective as possible it doesnt matter if it takes you a month to get instead of a week. 
---
I cant speak for anyone else but to me gw2 is most definitely the game that keeps me busy the most just because its content involves variety rather then repeating the same content over and over again which tends to bore me and makes me quit. There is a reason why this is my favourite mmo ofcourse and this variety is in the top 3. 
---
PvP and WvW obviously you're 100% right, not much of a pvper so personally it doesnt effect me much but obviously that doesnt mean its not a problem that needs addressing. 
---
Raids, while obviously its unfortunate they went from a 4 month cadence to a 9 month cadence gw2 is not the only MMO which such a slow cadence. people dont have to be happy about it ofcourse but I dont feel its fair to call it a drought when its on par with others. 
---
dungeons have been officially abandoned, they said years ago that going forward they'd be focusing on fractals.  not a draught more of a business decision. 
---
but regardless of all this, a content draught is not about singular elements, as the name itself implies its about content in general. The original post didnt say raids are really slow to release (which would be valid), they said huge content draught which means there was no content for a long long time which is obviously false (last content release was literally 1 hour 30 mins before that post.)  Even if you decide to ignore the living world rewards like requiem armor or Dragonblood weapons or the other skins and gizmos on offer, you still had the mounts to unlock and the legendary weapons, legendary armor and possibly sigils/runes,  minis, infinite tonics and earning gold to convert to gems to get skins off the gem shop by playing . There are so many rewards to earn and literally all 7 years of content is still in play to earn those rewards I honestly cant understand this talk of content draught when the whole game is always relevant and remains in play. Obviously I enjoy new things as much as everyone else and do want to keep seeing new content and story added but saying there has been nothing to do for months is perplexing at best!
---
Also where are we supposed to post for the strike missions.
---
They are crazy easy but shouldn't they get a place on LFG?
---
Same. Nothing was loading in the beginning, but now it works perfectly fine and looks gorgeous tbh
---
You are a saint
---
more like 850+
---
a dead game trying to stay afloat
---
Thank you so much! I just about have my set of med for my ranger. I am going to use this dye scheme. It's great!
---
Another amazing rifle but still no good profession to use it with...
---
No, hot pants for male characters pls.
---
It's nice that you, somebody who clearly has no issue doing this, can meme about it being way too easy. You know that this is aimed at 1111 spammers who hardly ever use a utility skill, running around on unoptimized builds.
---
&gt; PLUS, it essentially placed Bangar as a Hitler-esque villain,
---
I think they really did a very good job at writing him using the exact same rethoric fascists and ethnonationalists have historically used.
---
They made Bangar a believable anthagonist and he feels like a true villain. I think it will be cool to see how Jormag fits into all of this.
---
Honestly they might as well just end the saga there, they can't possibly top this
---
The wealthiest players are coordinating and overseeing large organizations of players in acquisition, production and sales.  This should be one of the least surprising things you could learn about wealth production and distribution in GW2 (or any human endeavor anywhere, really).
---
It's neither through story, nor does it seem to be from an event.  
---
But there are Ash Legion NPC's inside.
---
Anet has an opportunity here with strikes.  Notice how the strike boss is the same boss from the story, same environment, etc.  They're double dipping (which is smart and what we've been telling them to do for a long time).  At the door to go in the strike you have two options, squad and public.  I think they should add two more options, Raid and CM Raid.  In the raid version bump the damage and health of the boss to raid levels.  In the "CM raid" bump it up to CM difficulty, more damage, more punishing, shorter timer, etc.  Boom strikes are instantly quadruple dip (story, normal strike, raid crowd, cm raid crowd).  The raid and cm version don't have to have additional stuff, just make the existing encounter and mechanics harder.  Now we suddenly have raid level content with every strike release.  These could act as mini raids to bridge the gaps between the main raid releases.  
---
Anyways just my opinion.
---
Ahh thanks.  Will it spoil heart of thorns or path of fire?  Or just the living seasons?
---
can you people lighten the fuck up omg
---
[They released a longbow today...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d5jihz/golden_talon_longbow_and_primal_spirit_jackal/)
---
I just hope that this isn't Bangar being mind-corrupted by Jormag.
---
Oncluding invisible plattforming I assume
---
you are hilarious.
---
Actually I'd like it to be more than "Oh yeah another one of those rote episodes is out, same as before, CU in 5 months for the next one". Something new. Something surprising. Full Chronomancer scrap + reimplementation or so!
---
The chef event. He says "get me an apple. I used to know a charr that loved apples. Ahhh, memories." 
---
Or something. I'm sure people will love that callback. :P
---
Usually with Dungeons "Hard Mode" just indicates enemies/bosses are at the current level cap. They tend to pick older dungeons for that treatment.
---
Quick follow up question; your gold per hour for VM node farm doesn't include the cost of shipments, correct? Take Sandswept for example, you'll able to buy 15 shipments/hour, If you deduct the shipment cost, shouldn't you be earning \~15g only instead of \~30g/h? Which means, you will be earning less gold than that of SW. 
---
I must be missing something here, right?
---
Asura will most definitly be dubstep/electro inspired, with a mix of chillstep for the study music.
---
i don't know if you already got your answer by yourself, but they are more like T0... some events in open world are harder than this and i mean single person events ... literally went in with 9 randos, 3 of which couldn't jump so mesmer opened protal for them and then autoattacked boss to the death with 3 people got downed after aoe that similar to tequatl water splash or w'e its called. completed within 5 minutes from start to finish. no challange what so ever, don't need to try don't need to do anything just mash 1 button.
---
Auris Weirdbringer has a forge in the zone, but he's nowhere to be seen. AFAIK there's also no lore about him near the place which is a bit odd.
---
He was the side story NPC around the anomaly and darkstone stuff, who seemed to be travelling through or experiencing time in a non-linear way. It was really odd and unexplained.
---
^^shhh let me enjoy
---
I haven't found a way there either... Best I've managed to do was launch myself into the little gap over the door, but you get booted back out the second you cross the door's threshold.
---
How?
---
It's *supposed* to yeah, but let's be honest let's be honest 1-80 teaches you nothing.
---
Nope from story, so must be event or something you have to do in map
---
They've not said anything one way or the other about future legendaries. Maybe we'll hear something for the next episode, but who knows :)
---
Finally a cure for buttcapes. ‚ù§ 
---
Hope it's an ongoing trend with more tshirts, shorts, etc too. Like; all I wanted was simple looking town clothes for armor and they made me wait 7 years.
---
see you guys in 2 months, this time it was 3h content because of the story timegate "do events" =D
---
If im not wrong they said strike mission bosses will evolve every episode. This is its first stage maybe?
---
Ah yes. I forgot about skins.  those can be worth a pretty penny.
---
Yeah hard dungeons are kind of an odd name choice, I guess they just decided it was better than "Gubal Library 2.0"?
---
Sorry honey.  You‚Äôre right :)
---
I dont know where you're looking but every human male I've seen has been a Logan tier of hunk with facial features so sharp that you'd cut your eyes just by looking at them.
---
What big was there?
---
I actually saw him walking around. Interacting with him just brought up a dialogue box that said he was busy.
---
Yes I loved it as well. The map was much better than I anticipated. The story was much better and much much longer than I anticipated. This is a fully fledged episode and to me it is one of the best so far. For a long time have I not felt that much tension when going through the missions, even though it is not a surprise which way the story with the "Renegades" was going.
---
And the concert event - probably the best in the whole game and doing it the first time was one of the most memorable GW2 experiences I have ever had.
---
If Anet can keep this up and with 2 months release cadence (Ep1 is supposed to come in November) I am all for it. Just hope there is less of a disparity between content quality between Anet teams, as it has been apparent the previous seasons that some teams delivered better episodes than others.
---
I mean... not to be a downer, but it has hardly any replayability or challenge... i finished the whole thing in a couple hours just pressing 1, including the Strike which was supposed to be an "introduction to raiding"...
---
What am i supposed to do for the next 2 months now? Twiddle my thumbs?
---
Very dulfy style, 
---
Very nice vid
---
I have been at work so I haven't had time to actually play the content, so thank you!
---
And that's mildly disappointing, but...not totally unexpected to be honest.
---
400% Hype
---
Here we go, the extremely optimistic posts that desperately try to paint this release as being the best one ever, Because this has not been done for years.
---
It's the exact same thing we've done in the past but in a new map, as always. The concert is fun as fuck NOW because a ton of people are there and it makes it feel chaotic, like it's supposed to feel.
---
Everything else is the same as it has always been. You're making it sound like it's perfection, the Mona Lisa of game patches, when it's nowhere near that.
---
Fractal level 1 is harder than this.
---
Gen 2 legendary were supposed to be HoT content, and look how long it took them to do the whole set. At that pace, game servers will be shut down before a full new set could be released.
---
Honestly, something I will always give GW2 credit for is their environmental design. For all of my many issues in the game, no MMO does environments better, and it's nice to see even small improvements like this.
---
Plenty of people will be challenged by this, but there is definitely room for more difficulties of this.
---
This was more like a T1
---
Thank you to those who understand that there are other countries that do not speak and have no obligation to speak English every day. I think if Guild Wars wants to be a great RPG he has to put more translations in the game. That's my opinion, I'll stop playing until there are more translations for other players like me. Thanks again.
---
I guess you need all 4 Legion Keys from the meta.
---
According to Map Chat it's absolutely not worth it considering, that the Legion keys are &gt;2 Gold each on the TP.
---
Thats true it was damn good........... 3h of single player content in mmo game, lets see how many times you will do this concert and strike for no rewards before dying of boredom
---
Thanks for understanding so little. Now go droll over ANet again while they keep throwing stuff in the gem store :)
---
Hey there, your penne pasta over there might be radioactive
---
i mean, whether you find it impressive ultimately depends on what you enjoy or want from this game, but like i said, for anyone who cares about the story or causal PvE, the story progression not just through personal instances but through the overall map and events is really polished
---
I wonder if it'll use the Claw's particle effect, and thus give you the legendary effect without the legendary.
---
Now THAT will be a great meme - and I'm sure it'll be appreciated by those that made the Claw. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
&gt;What am i missing \[...\]?
---
A sense of fun and enjoyment, it seems.
---
And this error says:
---
Maybe it has to do with finding the secret at the Ash Legion camp
---
Can't you just let people enjoy it? Why do you feel the need to go into every positive thread and shit on people's exictement?
---
Somebody said it was about escorting a shaman event, just that the event was bugged and you couldnt start the escort. But idk, havent met anybody who made their way in..
---
u talking about something other mate XD
---
&gt;How's FF?
---
It's a great game. For me, unfortunately, I find I've grown bored of the "endgame" it offers. It doesn't really spice it up, but it consistently puts out great quality content.
---
The story in it is the best MMORPG story bar none. The most recent expansion story is superior to that of most, if not all, single player RPGs.
---
If you haven't played it, I think you can easily get a lot of fun out of it and I highly recommend it.
---
The human female definitely removed the stick from her ass this episode. She's a lot softer spoken rather than sounding like brute force personified. I was actually impressed at points.
---
I'm pretty sure that by "every human male I've seen" OP means excluding himself
---
how did you get in?
---
Wait is that recon cove
---
Ah... Wrong Door, I guess?
---
wait, how? jeez that¬¥s insane
---
Hey hey all! We found out how to get into the hidden POI. There are four carvings you need to press in sequence to find a tunnel. If you're wrong, you'll be set on fire. The carvings are in Malice's desk. Happy hunting. ;)
---
He's not talking about his char, and he's kinda right. Most male chars are pretty dang masculine
---
10 people with soldier gear can 1111 it to death.
---
Having done it, others are responding with "possibly" and "may".  I shall answer definitively.  It will spoil everything.
---
You have access to the episode, that's fine.  Do things in order if you're worried about spoilers.  The episode will still be there when you get through to it chronologically.
---
Yeah no, I'm not that convinced. I like that they tried to set up the social context in the ambient dialogue, but the story itself..
---
So, a large chunk of charr now suddenly hate *every other race*? Not just humans? What's their beef with the other races? (Other than "racists be racist")
---
And they think it's a good idea to try and *tame* an elder dragon? And not even the juvenile one, nooooo the big bad one? Even though killing the other elder dragons literally needed armies from all the races and still thousands died? What kind of *IDIOT* thinks that's a good idea? And what kind of idiots follow a guy who thinks that's a good idea?!
---
It's like Don Quichote suddenly acquires an army of believers? (From formerly warring factions, I might add)
---
I hope they iron the plot out next episode, but for now... they're idiots.
---
LFG should be SQL by now
---
Woah those shoulder look fantastic
---
&gt; gw2 client stop working
---
error name was in title
---
gw2 client stop working
---
Being asshole goes both ways on this either waste time killing mobs some random has spawned or just leave being an asshole..
---
I think even 6-7 could 1111 it
---
i don't think he is certain, just guessing. there is an achievement called carved path with description "uncover the secrets of the ash camp." there are also ash legion spies behind the unopenable door. so i guess that this could be related. there might be another entrance for all we know.
---
Yep!
---
Got better for me after a while on the map :) i complained in mapchat about the map being barren and looking like 2012, but the stuff just didnt load üôÑ
---
Conquest is unironically the only thing keeping spvp alive. By this, I mean it's the best part of the game mode that facilitates a unique, fun, and engaging skill set beyond class mechanics and interactions. Not to mention, classes are balanced around conquest so there's not a lot of options for deviation.
---
There's a good split between team-fighting and sidenoding whose dynamic is definitely team, map, and game dependent. It's not always the case the two are equal in time or energy spent but I'd say it's a solid 70/30 in favour of teamfighting. 
---
In any case, 2 wouldn't work but 1 would be kinda interesting though it feels derivative of conquest. Well it's basically conquest without the rotations so much more dumbed down.
---
Events in the new map start at :10 and :40, on a two hour cycle.  When you check to see what event is next, it's going to be starting at the displayed location at either ten minutes or forty minutes into the hour, depending on where in the hour you are.
---
Cavern in the north near Doomlore Ruins
---
Hmmmm, what is it that I don‚Äôt understand? Surely you, the one with such immense intellectual superiority, could explain to me, the one whose head is entirely empty due to having the audacity to enjoy a game?
---
give it up, i and alot of people have requested for this since the first few months of when the servers opened in 2012, its not gonna happen, just make a new character.
---
POI Recon Cove not discoverable? Door is broken and wont budge? Intended or not for clarity anyone?
---
Haven‚Äôt played it yet, but I think it would go a long way if ANet would would give bonus loot for the strike mission if the player hits 10k dps. I haven‚Äôt thought this through with healers and boon builds of course. But it would go a long way for the skill level of the average player since all they know is auto attacking
---
[Here](https://i.imgur.com/qMKOlkW.png) you all go.
---
"Well, have you paid them wages?"
---
There must be a more detailed error description somewhere, depending on where you getting the message from, show some screens, people might now the details.
---
You get 1 key from each of the 4 mini metas.
---
Holy shit, I was non stop saying it would be like the Dragon Bash "strike" but this sounds even fucking worse. Well I guess logging in won't be necessary again. Cya in another 2-3 months
---
Yes. It's triggered when the clone hits, not instantly.
---
&gt; this is CASUAL release.
---
Every release is casual release
---
Never really realized until now but are there mirrors in the game? Ones that work like you would expect.
---
Braham's VA is spectacular so far too, havent cared for the additional "unnamed charr #3" stuff he's done this patch but the actual character itself is probably the best its ever been
---
There are trees with symbols carved in them around the Wardowns that you can interact with.  Interacting with them in the correct order ports you to Recon Cove.
---
The next evolution of choya
---
Thanks alot!

Are you ok?
---
See, with the skyscale I feel like I'm constantly looking for places to land to reset my height. The griffon feels more... whooshy?
---
Time-traveling:-P
---
Standard rewards plus some nice RNG skins to grind for the people who like that sort of thing.
---
Yup, that's certainly a screen shot of it.
---
Oh, I see what I'm missing here. I didn't take into account the other gathered stuff that worth another 10 gold. Don't you ID your gear before selling for even more profit?
---
Most other games aren't trying to support 6-8 different official and unofficial game-modes.  It adds up and creates lots of drama when people feel neglected or less supported relative to the norms.
---
Then that is your problem, they are not gonna make it so you can change the race and they already gave that answer. So w/e  *shrug*
---
I'm loving all of the events.
---
Unless I'm wrong, didn't they say it'll become more annoying with each ep? So I'd assume it starts off stupidly easy, but with each ep, it adds mechanics for new people to learn on the go, and by the end it's basically 90% of a mid-tier raid boss or so o.o
---
Get an error every time I attempt to select Strike Missions (Public)
---
This is getting old.
---
Kas too, or at the very least the horrors have finally gotten to her.
---
Best part of the release was selling legion keys for 40g each for the first hour.
---
You got 69 characters?  I mean i ma heading that way so i would not be surprised we are a few who doing this. 
---
Race change wont come because they already said no not possible because old game, old engine, old code.
---
This map is incredible. I'm loving everything. I enjoyed the strike mission, too. I can see how they'll be valuable when there are many more in the future.
---
...and I'm sure there are some that will pay.
---
Wow, that'd be a great point if we just blindly assume they put in 110% effort and couldn't make it work rather than they did what was easier and still solved the initial problem regardless of what other minor one's it might cause
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d5n24i/hidden_ash_camp_poi/
---
&gt; nobody is playing it.
---
That is just false.
---
I am sorry but this is reaching a pathetic stage really...
---
You dont have to even look at the gem store when ever there is a update. And you cretainly dont need skins to play it. But this is were i get off obviously this is the trolls night trying to make more bs out of the shit you already poored out.
---
This is just a glitch in character creation page, I cant remember exactly what causes it but I had it happen to me before. It will go back to normal once you are properly in game. Here is the wiki entry for human hairs without the weird texture issue; 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Physical_appearance/Human
---
Got the 5 normal and 1 golden key from that New horizon package. 2nd normal key gave me the bow and the golden key gave me the jackal stag skin. I was quite lucky.
---
.....the question that simply won't die....even though Anet at some point said NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Yeah it'll challenge if you're standing still maybe.
---
Yes you would! The only reason why I didn't is because it just limits any more RNG such as getting exotics and stuff. If I didn't open them, it standardizes the price and makes it much easier to calculate. Though, I thought about doing it to champ bags, but there's just tooooo many in the game to standardize and too much data that hasn't been collected for that. So, for champ bags, I try to not include any exotics worth a pretty penny (&gt;1g). Silverwastes has standardize bags only because only two champ bags drop there and there was data on it.
---
I found the second marking by chance. Noticed the achievement, and found the first marking near the Ash Legion camp. Forcy For Glory (Forcy.2618) made a squad and recruited others to search for the markings. We were missing the 3rd marking, which I found last as well. After that, Forcy found directly what the last marking was :D  
---
There don't seem to be other combinations.
---
ü¶Ä HE DED! ü¶Ä
---
Need to be quick before people figure out it's as easy as a world boss.
---
Relogging doesn't help?
---
Phew, that's good to know. Thanks! I guess I never noticed it on my first character because her hair is dark.
---
&gt;this is reaching a pathetic stage really...
---
I'm well aware of the current state of Guild Wars 2
---
Where is the strike mission? Was it the oozes with the colours?
---
Not to mention that the map holds one of the most beautiful zones in GW2: Kralkatorrik's Emergence Zone.
---
Unless you don't play with shaders on "high". then it's probably pretty bland.
---
I'm super happy with everything. Enjoyed the story, strike, and new map. Here's to THE SAGA!!
---
&gt; true value
---
0 or X depending on your point of view ;)
---
omg was 400% hyped for this before release and it still didn't let me down, not sure if i helped much in the event at all i was so busy running around like a crazed loon enjoying myself nice to get that mosh pit feeling without any bruises lmao
---
Someone has said that it‚Äôs about interacting with some trees somewhere.
---
\#5 is in the locked POI
---
I would argue that most world bosses are harder tbh
---
What Is a "Strike Mission_?
---
Anyone getting Tyrian Exchange Vouchers from the black lion chests? Opened a bunch of chests and not one voucher which is supposed to be a common drop.
---
Look [here](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d5naac/solution_of_the_last_poi_in_grothmar_valley/)
---
Same for WvW reward track
---
wow, you must be an incredible daredevil! Even by soloing it on my daredevil, using the rotation to maximize my dps, the time limit ran out.
---
then again, the fact that not only did I survive but also got it below even half health just shows that this Strike Mission is way too easy. The SNOWBALL hurts more.
---
Word. I mean anet even called it prologue for a reason. I dont like every decision, but after these layoffs, free content of this quality is raising my hopes for the coming content releases.    And hating a game because you "just press buttons" is a pretty generic hate. It is as if i would read a book and would complain about the book only consisting of letters.
---
It has been addressed OOG in their promotional material [https://s3.amazonaws.com/guildwars2.com\_uploads/livingworldmagazine/icebroodsaga\_magazine\_EN/5-6/index.html](https://s3.amazonaws.com/guildwars2.com_uploads/livingworldmagazine/icebroodsaga_magazine_EN/5-6/index.html)  click on Jormag.
---
Yep. [We did it](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d5naac/solution_of_the_last_poi_in_grothmar_valley/).
---
It becomes available at the end of the prologue. You can join open squads however before you finish the story
---
ewwww
---
Wow this is some spooky shit
---
Before: Booo Arena Net never tell players how to do anything they always have to ask other players and guess. Now: Booo Arena Net tell players how to get in to the new prologue to the saga and what they must do to get there. 
---
Make up your minds maybe?
---
Good for the guild I guess
---
Mc is money coin?
---
I would like it... if it weren't for the torch mechanic. Failing a jump is already frustrating, but removing the ability to use the Prototype Position Rewinder and portals (if not mesmer) *and* having to backtrack because your torch went out due to the water/frogs just makes it even more frustrating.
---
I probably should not have posted, although I did say that it‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting from others. I‚Äôm getting mixed signals, I‚Äôll shut up until I‚Äôve actually played it.
---
&gt;How does this teach tanking, doing mechanics or healing when you can ignore everything?
---
I don't think that was ever the intention, as they can't expect a healer and a tank in every public group. I think the main intention is to introduce mechanics other than "press 1" in a controlled environment rather than in the open world.
---
Don't forget to buy new jackal skin and some BLC keys.
---
I really enjoyed it as well, looking forward to episode 1.

If I want to farm volatile magic for shipments, is it better to get a set of infinite unbound magic tools and add a glyph of volatility to it, instead of getting the Infinite volatile magic due to faster animation? I missed my chance on getting the VM tool last week, so I'd like to plan ahead.
---
Can we get a /stand command, where our character slowly gets up instead of insta-framing to their feet?
---
Hmm... taking into consideration, that they recently sued other game developer for using word 'Maiden' in the title i think Iron Maiden lawyers are breathing heavily right now. ;)
---
&gt;!Yes, its the font. Its extremely similar to maiden font. I dont care personally, but still,, its very similar. ;)!&lt;
---
Where were you since season 2? We always got the episodes free if we logged in during the chapter being up. With season 3 you had to own HoT to access the season but you would still be able to get the for free for future use. Same with season 4. Not sure wh you get worked up by that now years and years and years later?
---
if I claim it on my level 80, will my other characters be able to do it once I get them to 80?
---
After prologue you unlock the last fight as group content which should be a gateway into raiding content, at least that's what Anet said. Problem is, the fight is super easy to the point where you can't fail even if you fail at everything + the boss has no mechanics what so ever. Group size also isn't locked.

In order to unlock the last POI, you must press the "trees" with the symbols (found on Malice's desk in the Ash Legion camp) in this order: 
---
Arrow -&gt; Circle -&gt; Heart -&gt; Square
---
If you did it wrong, your character will be ignited on fire. 
---
If you did it right, it'll ask you if you want to TP to the last POI. 
---
Enjoy

The solution is on the desk in the ash legion camp &gt;! Face, reaching hand, janky oval, tree !&lt;

I queued for PVP, the queue popped, and the map-select spinner happened, but it stopped doing anything once the map was selected! I tried relogging, switching to another network connection, switching characters, entering an instance, entering a custom arena, and entering WvW, but none of that helped.
---
No.

---
I mean that's enough for, i never bother reading the patchnotes anyway. XD
---
No i meant post with the only purpose to shit on the game for what ever reason can come up with. Sad really...
---
It does. I've also experienced it.
---
It will run back to where it was eventually.
---
I have been dying to meet Malice Swordshadow, as my main is an Ash Legion. Finally they involved actual politics in the game, and not just straight out beating the crap out of every problem we encounter.
---
Thank you.
---
It sounds incredibly politically incorrect and offensive, but there is a BIG problem with social anxiety in the GW2 playerbase. 
---
They utterly insist on using shit gear, and blaming other people for being "toxic" if nobody wants to run with them. Whenever someone attempts to reach out and give them advice, not only do they reject it, but they call those helping them "elitist", and wear that claim with pride.
---
I remember screenshotting such a person in Crystal Oasis once, but sadly I cannot find the screenshots anymore.
---
That would be why they separate the patch notes into clearly labeled sections and sub-sections, all in very large and easy to read font, even with pictures for sections that could do with a visual aid like new items or new instances. There's no rule that just because they put everything there, you have to read all of it.
---
Or are you actually too lazy to scroll down a page and skim what interests you?
---
There's plenty of content in this release... Like, there is a lot of content. More than most of us were expecting. Not one but four metas, several races, a pretty big jumping puzzle, a full episode's worth of story, lots of new skins to earn (weapon, armor, backpack), an infusion...
---
Like, there is a shit tonne going on in this episode.
---
I have, each time I fully log out and back in it returns!
---
Im triggered that it's not called [Chili Khan Carne](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chili_con_carne). Unreasonably angry.

I think this is the perfect time to "Ducking Furries"

Looks around concert. Metal legion is the band plays there.
---
Story wise, I felt like the prologue was an above average introduction all around.
---
Congrats!
---
*And thus, the curious case of Auris Weirbringer has been solved.*
---
That's a portal for strike mission
---
Imagine Arena Net would tell us that they will be easy at first and then change with time with new features... Oh wait they did...
---
I crashed in Mistlock Sanctuary just now O.o First time since forever.
---
Auris paid me for publicity so people finally solve his mystery ;)
---
That doesn't *not* work for some raid bosses tbh
---
TBH the best thing is buying gathering tools with that glyph for karma because the gold used on unbreakable tools can be used on buying needed materials to begin with.
---
Malice's voice is fantastic, absolutely oozes Ash
---
&gt; What we have now is a new living world release 3 months 2 weeks after the last living world release and considering current release cadence is 3 months a 2 week delay is hardly a Content drought like the one experianced during HoT times!
---
Except this release is not the size of a normal living story release. Its much smaller being a prologue.
---
Support chronos might use pistol on rare occasions they need more cc, but dps chrono won't, at all. Dps currently is either sword/sword/greatsword or sword/sword/focus
---
Ah yes, back when purple dye was the most sought after item.
---
I mean, why do you mean that?
---
I'm not going to say I'm optimistic, because I've learned my lesson about taking the cheese on things too early (not just with GW2). I feel this particular map is very good and the story was above average, but we see irregular patterns of quality in every season of the Living World, so I want to see where they go from here. It's a good start, but there's a long way to go before Anet wins my trust back.
---
Want that deer-cal :D (but the bow looks *way too much* xd )
---
oh damn. havent even finished it haha
---
Because anet could think that they did well and delivered sufficient content, which they didn't. 
---
Players that basically hype even minuscule drops of content are not healthy for the game and encourage anet to perform lazily. 
---
It has to stop.
---
Word thanks man anything helps haha.  Been just all trial and error myself too.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one seeing a shift in quality. It's like the characters finally show some emotions. Think it's good acting as well as more bold writing.
---
Natural selection at its finest.
---
i did not ask. i just said i'd pay to do it. i know it's not doable. still it's something i'd like.
---
That's loading 4
---
50 Shades of Fur
---
Loading 3, though.
---
Wow.
---
I didn't even notice there wasn't any hearts. That's weird. I guess off loading the work to make people events for the keys
---
250 of one map's currency and 250 ecto to make the map's chair. 250 map chairs to make gift of the cushion, armrest, etc. 250 stacks of each to make the legendary chair.
---
The only ones i like having a main characters voice are the various norn amd charr that sound vaguely like Taimi because... Taimi
---
I don't have much else to say other than that I fully agree with you other than the fact that the community *definitely* has changed, just probably in a different way than what you're describing. I feel like the community feels a lot more isolated and grumpy, there's far less hype and far less subsets of dedicated players pumping out speedclears and whatnot... understandably. The game has gotten very stale outside of living story.
---
Wasn't there a hidden disco ball room in tangled depths
---
The map looks great. I said it looked that way because most of the stuff like trees wouldnt load for the first few hours...
---
Mike Z definitely did hint that it can be low-manned, so I can't say I'm surprised. This fight was meant for open world players, not for raiders. They most likely balanced it around the kind of damage output they expect in the standard story mission, not raids.
---
I got called "negative" during a strike mission for typing  "residentsleeper" in the middle of the fight while still not getting hit by not even one attack.
---
&gt; Bound Hatched Chili Pepper Home Instance Node 
---
Not sure if this is intentional but you can't seem to "consume" these peppers for magic. You also only get 1 from the node, not 2 - 3 like the other nodes.
---
So what? It's not supposed to invalidate their existance. As more mechanics are added difficulty increases.
---
Games nowadays compete which one is more braindead. Even ads say that games play themselves and that they require no skill.
---
If you click on him during the first instance he is refered to as flame imperator. that's why I said that.
---
D:
---
Ah.  You just made me realize!  What if the one Jormag speaks to in the trailer is Bangar?  Nobody saw that coming.
---
Id say some champs are more difficult than this first strike mission. The attacks are very slow and well telegraphed. There is also next to no damage threat so you should never actually get low. But thats probably the entire point of them. They are supposed to be easy and just introduce people to these sort of fights with well telegraphed attacks. For a lot of raid newbies this is very well designed content.
---
For me personally this is not enough to keep me interested in the game. So i quit after finishing the story and trying the strike mission one time. I will bow down to the anet overlords and play the game the way it is intended to be played and log in every few months to play the newest story chapter untill they decide to release actual expension level features *cough* elite specs.

Aaahhhhhh...... Ty so much &lt;3

As a former WOW player I SCREAMED when I saw the neglected child LFG in GW2. It's simply injustice.
---
I did it without struggling to figure out where to go, if I can anyone can.
---
Haven‚Äôt gotten to the story yet, but yes, this kind of stuff is very frustrating. I don‚Äôt get why we can‚Äôt have checkpoints for achievements like this?
---
IT IS!!!  ‚ÄúCheer‚Äù was fun but once the ‚Äúcatch the charr‚Äù mechanic was brought in I was audibly cheering at my computer.  And the finale had me screaming with laughter.  All while listening to someone partying a bit too hard over the comm. I love rock concerts (well...live music in general) so I knew this event was a must do.  But WOW that was a non-stop feel good event that just got better as it went on.  I can‚Äôt wait until the next concert!  (These songs will be available online right?  Right?!)
---
I can honestly say I was 400% hyped when I saw this event.    Absolutely brilliant.
---
Red dot sights or?
---
We used to. Past episodes had tons of checkpoints for quick cheevo attempts. But one step forward two steps back is a thing.
---
Anet can't account for taste. Objectively, a lot of love went into this map, although the events are very spread out indeed. That some people don't like Braham isn't surprising, he was really goofy this episode. But I assume this was to contrast the reveal at the end and to account for how grim things are going to get from hereon onwards. 
---
Story was brilliant, though. I was sceptical at first, but it soon became clear that the writers really went all-in given what they had to write about. Of course saving Gorrik from thugs isn't as exciting as flying into Kralkatorrik to beat up his rage, but the quality of the writing itself was absolutely laudable. The ambient dialogue, too.
---
:O
---
I *think* CS and distortion are the exception.
---
Basically, if it primarily affects your enemies, it's on-hit, per clone and if it primarily affects you it's instant.
---
...right.  : )
---
I agree. I like them and I hope when they evolve this mission in episode 1 like they said in the announcement the difficulty increases too. Maybe this was an introduction to the feature, make it easy so people come back and make the other harder. They won't get me into raids but I can see myself doing this every day.

---
AND YOU'RE SINGLE? YOU NEED THE NATIONAL GUARD ON THIS SHIT!
---
I'm not underestimating what each living story season has to offer at all, but you're definitely overestimating how much entertainment value each of them have to offer. The story playthrough itself does take about 2 hours, yes, but often times the releases come with something like a new mount or some new skins. The skyscale probably was the most time consuming and that took about 8 hours of collective gameplay at most, excluding timegates. Pretty much nothing else was of value for me unless I happened to like the skins. Collecting achievement points provides no value unless you are one of the 0.001% who want to compete for rank on them. 
---
If you include the fact that I have to work 8-9 hours every day, have to sleep, and have other things in my life I need to be doing, the last ep of LS4 provided me with things to do for not even 3 full days. As I've stated in my previous reply to you, basically the entire game is in content drought *except* for LS which has a release every 3-4 months. The LS content releases aren't poor for what they provide, it's the fact that *literally everything else* is stagnating that's the issue. Basically in order for this game to be in a healthier state they would need to maintain what they're already doing with LS along with also releasing new fractals, raids, and better + more frequent updates to PvP and WvW.
---
I would like to also find out what MMOs you're talking about that have 9 month release cadences? I've played B&amp;S and now play FFXIV and both of those games released new raids more often than GW2 does and they also release new dungeons alongside of them, very often too. 9 month release cadence you would expect some *very* flambuoyant creations with very complex and interesting mechanics that keep players busy for a while, but the past two raid wings were cleared within the first day from what I understand.
---
You also glossed over the fact that yes, anet abandoned dungeons to replace them with fotm, yet a new fractal comes... once a year? The new fractals since HoT launch have been shattered observatory, nightmare, chaos, twilight oasis, deepstone, and siren's reef. That's 6 new fractals since 2015 which was 4 years ago. Fractals are what they chose to replace dungeons with because they're designed to be *short and quick to do*. They have always had less map detail and with no path overlap like dungeons, meaning they take far less time and effort for them to develop. Yet at best we can expect one new one every 6 months at earliest.
---
And finally...
---
&gt; a content draught is not about singular elements, as the name itself implies its about content in general
---
&gt; they said huge content draught which means there was no content for a long long time which is obviously false
---
This is subjective and you are basically saying that because *you* personally are comfortable with the amount of content that already exists in the game means that it means there is no drought, when in reality the *entire playerbase* has essentially nothing new to entertain themselves with outside of the living story for at bare minimum, 6 months. It's very clear to me why the game feels stale under these conditions personally.
---
Ye it‚Äôs quite simple and fun
---
It's such a mess, I love it!
---
Nope, story specific.
---
As someone who has raided, I don't even want hard content just engaging content.
---
I want to be engaged with the combat, gear, builds, horizontal progression systems, reward systems etc. for the majority of the gameplay, like I would be in say a singleplayer game. Unfortunately for me GW2 feels like it is missing something, and it's not just "challenging content"
---
I've also noticed a new camera behavior in parts of the map. Off the top of my head, I recall the ash legion camp. The camera has a slight sway that is noticeable when you are moving and then stop. Additionally, I could not zoom all the way to first person. The character would also change direction while the camera remained in place (as if I was holding the right mouse button, the A/D key, while not moving the mouse).
---
Did you notice this?
---
Thanks for this! I love your stuff.
---
But... Coin #5 is missing for me.
---
Oh, I didn't read the rest. I thought this was real, lol.
---

 I wanted this so bad ever since they had that glitch where people could get it
---
It‚Äôs to the left of the vault. The vault is North of the Northern most waypoint. The JP itself is kinda in that North-West corner of the map.
---
I wasnt expecting a strike mission with this patch so on that end that was cool for something they announced weeks ago. Difficulty wise i also hope it ramps up, consensus sounds like this is a choya pinata difficulty
---
This is what I meant in my comment, the leveling is meant to do this but it doesn't.
---
I just did the concert event and holy shit it was such dumb fun.
---
And the music is sick.
---
C H A L L E N G E   M O T E
---
Also, yes, increase the difficulty.
---
This culture of "everyone should be able to see the story, even the incompetent fool with no arms!" needs to end.
---
The concert meta event is like the best thing in this ep seriously
---
Ah yes, the details of lots of invisible walls, lack of engaging metas making the map feel like a permanent grindy festival, the complete lack of even remotely interesting gameplay in the open world due to the absence of combat and the whole lot of downtime and waiting around between events. Truly extremely fun to play on.
---
It's an absolute madhouse of an event and I loved every crazy second of it!
---
I LITERALLY JUST GOT THE MOUNT WITH 1ST KEY FROM NEW HORIZONS PACKAGE AND THE BOW WITH THE 5TH KEY
---
FINALLY I GET GOOD LUCK WITH KEYS
---
Ephram is best imperator, we must protect him
---
thanks. yeah got it. ended up asking it in game.
---
Did anyone get into public mode? I was wondering whether that is even easier than the squad mode. If that was the case there are basically 3 difficulty mode: story (intended solo)/public/squad. This should give plenty of room to increase the difficulty of squadmode.
---
I think they will do a show build up in difficulty. This boss is for pushing the lowest common denominator. My guess is that they are going to make them harder as the saga goes on, as a treadmill of sorts.
---
No, you are not xD
---
My brain collapsed for a second.
---
Any clue on his last location?
---
Not sure if this is a gw2 bug or otherwise, but they changed something that causes the GW2 Launcher to fail with a "Download failed!" message in the client.  Also having some of my direct client shortcuts get stuck.
---
I JUST GOT BOTH FROM 1ST AND 5TH KEYS FROM NEW HORIZONS PACKAGE!!!
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEET
---
Except for the announcement everyone watched, the multiple teasers, the trailer... Like you'd have to be under a rock to not know the prologue is live.
---
There is actually a massive amount of things to do on the new map - more than most PoF maps. It's a really good patch - PLAY it. That's most of the fun - discovering things for yourself.
---
First of all you have to have done the story of the prologue first, then just interact with the four trees marked on the map in the order they are numbered with.  And TADA! You‚Äôre in the Recon Cove!
---
The link is broken, can you re-link it? I'm missing #2 and #15 and just need to know where those ones are located.
---
haha, yeah try to spin it around so that YOU are shine in a "better" light.
---
slow clap.
---
F2p. I might get the expansions later on but F2p for now.
---
Definitely shredding the strike mission...in seconds..
---
Now you carry the eternal flame. But your body is not used to it yet...
---
Louder for the people in the back.
---
As an MMO hardcore-ist for a good 13 years, really wish the hardcore crowd would stop thinking everything is for them.
---
This one wasn't advertised as such. Sheesh. Let it do what was advertised.
---
They weren't built-in emotes though
---
Revenant is designed in such a way that they couldn't equip those racial skills, so that's.....ir*reveant*.
---
Just gonna ignore Exordium and Sharur and Eureka and Xiuquatl? Those ones are incredible.
---
Wasn't that about pre LS ones? Making these journeys took time and resources but post HoT ones?
---
I love these supremely bitter comments whenever anyone expresses their enjoyment
---
Maybe while your doing not one but FOUR meta events, the biggest jumping puzzle since S3, a full episode's length story, several new backpacks, new armor skin, new weapon skins, new infusion, new emotes, new map, new strike... Like, you guys are trying to be unhappy. The prologue is actually awesome, like it's fucking full of content.
---
I don't know where you got the loving cats.
---
Charr are mostly shown as being condescending towards other races, with the exception of norn who follow similar values.
---
There's the Olmakhan but the whole point of them is that they're the complete opposite of the legions. And they didn't appear until season 4.
---
What we have seen over the past several years are the developers who promoted challenging pvp, wvwvw, and pve content leave the company. We have not seen the same exodus in the narrative team. In fact, that team seems to be relatively large within arenanet.
---
This is the result of that shift in the company.
---
Nope. (Vertical) Mirrors are rare in games because they basically double graphic load and are a pain to implement.
---
20 decoration tokens gotten from defeating the final boss of the Hall of chains raid. He drops a few every time gurranteed
---
There's a shit tonne of content in the patch. Fucking play it. Lots of rewards, weapon skins, armor skins etc. The gem store is about the same as it has been for ages (exclusive access to mount skins, occasional Black Lion Chest skin).
---
This is the first JP I made without messing up at least once &amp; no guide. So yeah go for it!
---
I know what you mean but I hope they changed their minds. They have released the ears from a different one separately didn't they? 
---
And yes there are so many cool helmets I want to have in the game maybe they need some reddit riot haha
---
Dhuum KP is a guild decoration thing what you get from the final boss of Wing 5, people use KP(Kill Proof) as to prove they killed the boss, after each kill(resets on Monday) you get 1-5 KP from each boss you kill in raids
---
Not sure if your question was meme or not, I took it as not meme
---
Little short on time to solo first try (on my warrior). Too easy as a Duo. Pretty sad they made it this simple.
---
Thanks for this, couldn't find the last vista.
---
No it was a serious question, thanks for answering :)
---
I am a mesmer main as well. And since very long so have been through all the chrono changes. I play wvw and pvp primarily. You can still play chrono, in the end skill beats builds and I know mesmer players are more invested and less casual than you would find many others.
---
that might be the case, but to answer the question: 
---
KP means Kill Proof, as in "proof" of how often you killed something
---
They keep designing great things and then not using them on the next release, and never go back to update them.
---
The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing.
---
cuz having content for everyone keeps everyone happy
---
the casuals are the lifeblood of most games, especially gw2(sad maybe, true nonetheless)
---
it's not even about the ability to rise up to the challenge, many people simply want a casual stroll through a bunch of npc roleplaying their drama..and that's fine
---
"WHY?" because they are the majority and need to be catered to, it's common sense really from a business standpoint
---
the only issue is when you cater only to them and alienate everyone else in the process which is what anet is actively trying to do
---
yea it's totally concerning how much they dumb down stuff and i'm worried myself! but going completely 180 and making story difficult is not the answer either
---
spider queen is unironically harder than like a third of the raid bosses
---
What??
---
no reason to do guides for .... a dead game  L-O-L!
---
The whole ordeal goes as follow:
---
The Charr know about Braham's bow, that chinked Jormag's tooth. *Everyone* knows about it.
---
The Charr have never been at peace, and all they know is conflict and waging war. And Bangar is a warmonger, but a strategist as well. Which is why he did not start a civil war among the Charr due to the treaty woth Kryta.
---
Bangar enjoys this moment of "confusion" from the Charr that have never known otherwise, and thus, provokes a belief that everyone else that is not a Charr is trying to end their "sovereingty". It's essentially speeches and rumours that set the "Us vs Them" premise, and "Them" have an Elder Dragon in their control (again, because they see *everything* as weapons, due to their militaristic culture).
---
Bangar going North, to Jormag, is not to *tame* Jormag, but make him a weapon. It's a fools errand, but he does not see that way. He believe that if a mere non-charr (or Rytlock, someone he looks down on), can do so, why should't the one fighting for Khan-Ur of the Charr be able to do as well?
---
The whole premise is that Bangar is going to fail, but probably wake Jormag up and set the tone for the rest of the Saga.
---
They said they would like to go back to the dry top thing where a map gradually got bigger, so let's hope this is what happens.
---
&gt; This culture of "everyone should be able to see the story, even the incompetent fool with no arms!" needs to end.
---
Yeah, screw that huge majority who keep the game alive! Lets make all content challenging and watch as the game dies instantly. It would be my fault though, its all on Anet!
---
Yeah, you're a idiot spouting stupidity. You create content that scales so it pleases everyone. Trying to act like it shouldn't is asinine and shows how dumb you are.
---
This one is bugged for me.  
---
I did get to the end anyway just to explore but you can't open the chest if the braziers are bugged.
---
I will check that out
---
Someone at ANet:
---
*"And I am getting PAID to write this!"*
---
An unknown, high profile Blood commander seems, for some reason, very upset about the popularity of Snargle's novels within his legion - and orders to treat them as illegal. 
---
The note ane book can be found near the prison director...
---
You would benefit from making your own thread.
---
Fix time:-P
---
You need the latest taco to make it work:-)
---
Same with the new Charr faces. I was really disappointed to see that they weren't in the Makeover Kit. Hoping they'll be added in a future update.
---
They already confirmed the next episode would be a different map in the far Shiverpeaks iirc.
---
The bow is what makes Bangar believe he has a chance. I see Jormag Icebrooding him when he realizes he fucked up, and Jormag present the whole "I give you power" to him.
---
It's beautiful..
---
Did you get electrocuted?

I think the complaint is that it's even below the level that people were expecting. Personally, I was thinking easier T4 fractal level stuff maybe, but apparently it's closer to T1...which I don't know how that really prepares you to go into raids.
---
That's a shame

Same

It's true masterpiece:-D

All the casuals with skins they bought from the BLTC are the real big dick energy chads alphas btw. Calling them betas just shows how insecure you are about the fact they have the new jackal skin.
---
It's modern enough but they somehow made it look oldschool through post-processing. The teasers had me worried, but now I'm kinda impressed.
---
I missed it, is it on a timer? I saw there's a daily achievemt for it, so it's gonna happen again, right? Please?
---
I wouldn't bother, anyone who uses the term "beta" seriously isn't worth responding too.
---
Light and heavy have the opposite problem from medium since their buttcapes are connected to the legs instead of chest. So the shirt isn't as much as a godsend to them than pants/shorts would be.
---
Speedrun competitions soon?  
---
oof I'm not ready.
---
Deroir already soloed it.

Jumping Puzzle - Can't interact with the Braziers. The action key doesn't work at all on them and if you use Torch skill to light the braziers, it doesn't work on some of them. Looks like I'm a minority but this bug prevents me from completing the JP.

Client Crashing - I've sent report on all of them but they're mostly related to effects not loading properly it seems. This also occurred in Mistlock Sanctuary for me.

Wooo boy, don't choke or anything on that self-righteous indignation or anything. If you wanna have a brainy pissing contest I'll happily discuss particle physics with you anytime. We can go over the most significant delayed neutron factors which go into the calculation for reactivity for a given isotope of a given nuclear element. But that aside, WP's video isn't the reasoning for this complaint, merely the catalyst. When I saw that he has 12k spirit shards it made me wonder how the fuck he had so many spirit shards. That's when I was reading in the wiki and a small side note denoted that the old system for gaining skill point past lvl 80 never went away. There is no in game reference to this. I log in one day to find my unending exp bar replaced by a mastery bar with no explanation. Years later I find out the significance of wasting hours and hours of time trying to find all these hard to acquire remaining mastery points. Nothing in the game ques you into this fact. I had to coincidentally find this information on the wiki. That's the problem. I've never been in serious need of spirit shards because I had hundreds from pre-HoT, but when I realized that someone had so many more than me it made me wonder. If I hadn't watched that video, I would still be ignorant of this fact. There needs to be an in game explanation of how this system works to clue people in on the importance of finishing all masteries.

didnt ask

For some reason I read that in Skritt voice. What have this game done to me.
---
Is it just the hair or did her expression change too? She just seems so over everything now. Just done with all the crap going on and just wants to drink some wine and read a book in a corner.

This is a post of the location of the glyphs, the correct order is  Green, Purple, Red, and Last Blue waypoints.
---
Like this gigantic and yet *completely unused* 20% of the map's area.
---
I am like 90% certain it's Drakkar. Very similar to that long, honestly rather worm like concept art we saw
---
Lack of attention to the fact that
---
1) you don't get spirit shard
---
2) exp bar no longer resets like it used to
---
change occured before HoT came out so this actually predates masteries.
---
There are also plenty of other sources for these. Basically worthless unless you are doing the specific things they are needed for ... you are upset over not getting enough trash?
---
I wouldn't say, the design seems very different from the one he had in GW1 and from the WIP one they showed in the presentation.
---
Why I can't access through the (public) option?  
---
Whenever I try that a small window pop up telling: "Unable to complete the operation (permission denied). (Code=49:5:37:2908:101)".  
---
Anyone else got this or can explain why I'm getting it?
---
I'd say it's mostly full of bipolar hypocrites.
---
&gt; And since when are shitty map events promoted as "content"?
---
Since always?

I've been getting a sound bug lately. I can't get sound when something is directly in front of me. Like GW2 is trying to do surround sound and thinks there is a front speaker (most noticeable when characters are talking, if I look directly at them I can't hear them, I have to place them to my left or right). Everything I can tell from the PC settings side is just set to stereo and I don't notice the issue anywhere else. Suggestions?

Reminds me of this thing. Would make sense, given how there's an Orr gate below it.

*Look son, up there, your great-great-great-grand father used to farm vaettirs.*

Can u use the glyph on permanent tools?

Sam is my boy.

The Strike feels easier than even the easiest World Bosses.
---
How is this supposed to be a stepping stone into raids?
