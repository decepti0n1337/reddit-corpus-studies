it is exactly as tedious as you think it is. There's no indication in game of you already shooting it before.
---
---
---
Looks like a gorgeous game, but is it any good? Haven't really heard much about it in a long time tbh.
---
I'm on 16/25 too. I have no idea I guess it's just keep going round until you find them all
---
Spyro! Nice work!
---
With regards to meta and druid: it would probably depend at the tier you play it. Effectively dead for Fractal CMs, but I would presume (and have seen occasionally) some T4 fractal LFGs asking for one, usually with Chrono + Druid (the old 'safe' combo for doing fractals, slowly dying out). With the loss of Glyph of Empowerment, and the nerf to Chrono's shatters, very few 'very serious' players will want one over the now vastly more common combo of Renegade/Firebrand - which can cover the same boons and have slightly different and probably better suited buffs for fractals  - spotter is redundant thanks to AR conversion, meanwhile Assassin's Presence is great, and Bane Signet can be shared for a temporary increase in power. The spirits - which were part of what Druid brought - usually just frost spirit - are/can be taken by a Power Soulbeast, which can also bring One Wolf Pack (and Power Soulbeast itself is one of the strongest burst DPS classes).
---

---
Unless Chronomancer gets the shatter change reverted, and then both it and Druid get some buffs (which is unlikely - the duo of both dominated the meta for both fractals and raids for several years and still have effectively guaranteed spots in a raid composition), it's likely that Druid (and Chrono) will probably continue slowly dying out from fractals. So, to answer your first question, if you try to do fractals as a druid, it will only get harder from now on.
---
&gt; Does the community throw shady eyes at anything that's not meta currently?
---
To answer this, it depends on whether you mean the exact meta, or meta in a more broad sense. The exact meta - the community doesn't generally ask for it, especially in a pug group. It would take too much time. This is where the 'broad' sense of meta comes in: a way to generate boons (mainly might, quickness, fury, and alacrity - so druid, chrono, firebrand, renegade), a bannerslave (warrior), and a few DPS. The types of DPS those are, is important. For fractals, groups want Power DPS. Bursty power DPS, to be more specific. They do not want condi DPS - showing up to a CM run with condi DPS is... not great in the eyes of many people. Same thing with certain raid bosses - people will want you bring condi dps and not power dps. 
---
So shady eyes are thrown - if you are bringing something that is even outside the sense of 'broad' meta.  But not if it's outside the exact meta.
---
Yay!! You got the reference 🙌
---
The key thing to note is "greater than what is known to have been traded on the gw2efficiency subreddit". If he acquired the items outside of the subreddit, through means that cannot be tracked publicly, then the argument falls apart.
---
Gahhh the hammerhead's eyes aren't on the end of its hammer heads, that's the entire point of the hammer head being what it is
---
AFAIK it is happening to everyone else and was listed on the gw2 bug report forums.
---
Honestly I'd just keep trying until I get it. It's just annoying, especially with the semi-forced action camera. The other achievement to get 10 targets in one clip will probably be significantly more annoying, this one just takes some tedious time.
---

---
Ah, okay.  cool.  thanks!
---
Your question brings a bit of an identity crisis for the Ebon vanguard. They are a military unit that swore to keep danger at bay and has historically fought charrs in countless battles. If they allowed a charr unit to be formed, it would probably be met with a lot of protests as it would bring the organisation's identity to a wall. 
---
However, like you mentioned, they dont fight anymore against the charr. Therefore, it could be possible to reform the organisation to allow charr and human soldiers to work together. It would certainly not be under the same name as it symbolizes both the positive and negative of the Vanguard. Charr would probably scowl considering how many ancestors they lost to the Ebon Vanguard.
---
How wild, archeage has always looked good, to think they could up it even more :o
---
Thanks for your input! I guess to some extent, that new organization wouls be the pact, where not only charr and humans get to work together for a brighter future.
---
Ranger = Rifle. High DPS hunter/sniper style - not as annoying like the current deadeye but hits like a truck
---
Elementalist = Sword off-hand so I can finally be Gandalf in game
---
Necro = Swords (main/offhand) and skills like that of necros in D3. (but I guess that'd be asking too much)
---
Warrior = Pistol offhand ala Rytlock or staff and it'd be used like a land spear. 
---
Guardian = Maybe Rifle? or pistol?
---

---
Well, I've only ever played these classes so I can't say about other classes.
---
Rite of Spring
---
Some of their water weapons' attacks are music-based, so there's precedent.
---
2-3 months of daily grind just for skyscale? that's nonsense
---
you can probably tryhard it 10 days or 3 weeks of casual play
---
Uhhh excuse me but last I checked Archeage had more content than the majority of all other MMOs. If anything it had almost *too much* for how many people were playing after the first year. The biggest issue it had before is that the publisher for the western release was absolute dogshit and made it mega p2w and conned the people who purchased the founders pack. Lack of content was never a problem for it.
---
Well, they used the outdated GW1's engine to do GW2. They should totally get a new engine for the game or get to work for a more robust and recent one for a "Remaster" lol
---
As a programmer, I myself was afraid of touching 10 years old spaghetti code without breaking anything.
---
I would rather have an optimization overhaul for GW2 than a graphics update. Even core game graphics holds up very well, it's mostly just shaders that seem improved since 2016.
---
GW1, however, could use a graphics overhaul.
---
the condi variant is preferable in pretty much every raid scenario including xera
---
the only place for the power version(besides fractals) is in squads that don't stack dh for fmw but those probably run double healer anyway
---
the build looks strong on paper but it's actually rarely taken in raids
---
This is awesome, well done :D
---
if you actually do know how to do the boss then just whisper commanders and say something like "hey i don't have kp yet but i know what to do can you give me a chance?"
---
you'd be surprised how often that works..again, assuming you actually perform good
---
You're asking a GW2 focused sub so you'll get a lot of biased opinions towards the game. The game has one of the best F2P systems out there, since the actual restrictions are mostly to prevent spammers and gold sellers. The actual leveling process will be the same speed as someone who purchased the game, so there's no reason NOT to try it.
---
With that said, I personally wouldn't tell anyone to put money into any F2P game until they're sure they're going to put a ton of time into the game, and that goes for this game as well. Get to max level (or near it), read about the different endgame activities and see what piques your interest, but don't waste your money on a spur of the moment decision. There's a ton of stuff to see even without the expansions and living story, so take your time and have fun!
---
&gt;Uhhh excuse me but last I checked Archeage had more content than the majority of all other MMOs
---
As much content as our SPvP and WvW you mean?
---
Like, people release MMos with some maps, toss a few repetitive crafting and PvP actives, label it as sandbox and sell everyone "Whoooooo!!! We have infinite community content".
---
I take ArenaNets content release schedule better than any of those indie MMos any kitten day.
---
To add to this the entire core story is part of the free to play, along with dungeons and I'm pretty sure fractals.
---
Just hold right click to control the camera.
---
Either way, you're gonna have to aim. No tab targeting here.
---
Thanks for the caveat. I do plan to filter out excessive endorsements.
---
What you suggested is exactly what I was planning to do.
---
It seemed to me that the f2p portion is actually decently... let's say packed with contents.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Thank you again for the reply!
---
Edit) 
---
Any insight on their different packages?
---
Just by the looks of it, the more expensive packages seem to provide customization and in-game currency of sort?
---
fractals are but gearing past t2 is a pain with the tp restrictions and no raids
---
That is very true
---
try target those far away, change platform next time u do it and try again
---
Do you mind elaborating on that?
---
power herald has a lot of survivability but lacks damage thus it is very bad for dps. glint provides boons which should be covered by the supports already which makes them mostly go to waste. you can however swap to alacrity renegade which uses sword sword staff and kalla shiro so it is not that different but you will need diviner armor for that so that the alacrity you provide lasts longer so you can reach 100% uptime
---
You don't need all these deluxe stuff, they are just gems for in-game purchases, like extra bank space, extra character slots and skins. The "base" expansion has all the content you need.
---
Nice :).
---
No problem! I do hope you and your friend enjoy your time playing the game!
---
EDIT: What /u/pike_27 said, essentially. The higher level packages come with additional goodies, but none of it is essential. The premium currency (gems) is used primarily for the gem store that provides account purchases (more bank space, more inventory space, additional character slots) or stuff that is QoL or geared towards making your character's looks (outfits, weapon skins). None of it really gives you an advantage where it matters, such as PvP or better gear for PvE than what you can get from playing.
---
Ah thanks for the pointer.
---
That'll come handy for sure.
---
Haha that is true...
---
What are the differences? 
---
Man, I didn't realize this this makes it three times as expensive...
---
The auto-aim from the action camera helps quite a lot with getting 10 in a row. It's mostly a matter of targeting ones that are relatively close and only firing if the target is highlighted.
---
Without the action camera, you cannot do those events.  Aiming the camera without Action Camera on won't cause you to actually shoot your attack in the direction of the camera, which is what you need to do.
---
Probably a regional difference then :D
---
Ignore my advice then I guess
---
After some 2k hours in a game, when I was in WvW I realize you have the option to turn off land borderlanes in your minimap/map.
---
Oh god... the map looks very uncomfortable, but beautiful.
---
ANet: Time for more Scrapper nerfs!
---
Scrapper: Aight, Imma head out.
---
im getting down voted, but if you take a look at big content creators ( shorts_gaming, jawgeous,etc ) and wvw guilds that post iin youtube, stream in twitch, etc... they've all quit recently for the same reason, the majority of "nobodies" that plays gw2 for pvp/wvw.
---
GW2 needs to better optimize current hardware utilization. There is no excuse for a game this old to have shitty frames. BDO just improved its graphics, which it didn’t need to do, and my rig can destroy frames in 1440p in the new setting. Yet it chugs in 7 year old GW2 towns. By the way improved graphics did absolute zero to make BDO a better MMO.
---
Aw man, I've even completed creating full ascended gear on my char and slotted it all with +7AR...
---
Season 1-4 were fine as well, but honestly it all went to shit after season 5. The mixed queue to duo queue change was actually really bad for the mode. I know at least 20 people that all stopped consistently playing pvp due to the inability to play with multiple friends outside of unranked. That one change literally destroyed teams and population and ATs didn’t come fast enough to replace it (and also didn’t fill the niche well enough when they did come)
---
Are you getting downvoted? Hmm
---
But then again, given what you have told me..
---
Does that mean that the game does not have much to offer besides PvP/WvW?
---
That would be contradictory to what I've read and heard so far..
---
Or is it just that ppl who were playing for PvP and WvW are done with the game given the recent(?) development in that field?
---
It got me interested/motivated to finally try fractals. I was browsing wiki for crafting materials and stumbled on the cores which led to me noticing fractals. Im currently stuck in lvl24 nightmare fractal no ones queuing. Maybe I'll try creating a group this weekend but would not get my hopes up
---
Those are the first thing I noticed in the new map and as usual, sad to know that they're NPC only.
---
There already is a whip in the sylvari story, with amazing animation and sound effects. They should really add it in as an official weapon.
---
That is true, and you have right to voice it, but dont scare off potentional players then
---
Fun fact all of the gw2 maps have water underneath. Tangelos depths is the easiest to glitch out of since you can find and touch the edge of the world.  ( I’ve done this quite a lot getting stuck in crevices)
---
&gt;  they want to keep it accessible
---
If they actually cared about this they'd optimize the game so that it wouldn't incinerate even the most modern CPUs
---
I mean I don’t think we need a massive overhaul to some core areas, but I’ve met quite a few people who like to just walk around Tyria and stare at stuff. Heck, I do it myself sometimes.
---
Yeah, I still see some chrono comms running around. The other day I saw guild group running herald as comm, no ventari... so I guess they were being babysitted by 2 other healers min for that kind of comp. hmm.
---
Well, if you're running two healers (which most groups do), then you shouldn't need ten-person Regen.
---
Fractals (a Form of endgame) is way easier to Progress smoothly with the expansions aka full account 
---
Just try the Game ftp its perfect to See if you like it 
---
full Game is realy worth it If you do, espacially since you get First Expansion free when buying the second
---
The first version was Pay to Win Garbage. You had to spend obscene amounts of money to keep up with the other people spending obscene amounts of money. And keeping comparative was crucial to enjoy any of the features it touted.
---
This one claims it won't be pay to Win garbage because you now also have to buy the box. However, the original Archage also didn't advertise itself as pay to Win garbage, so I have my doubts this version is even worth looking at.
---
PvE in this game wasn't for me, even though i enjoyed ESO,WoW  pve.. how gw2 handles their pve isnt for my taste. But the mounts in this game is by far the best i've ever played. Each mount is unique, riding it feels unique, everything about mounts in gw2 is fucking phenomenal
---
no king rules forever my son
---
"No P2W" - Now it really has my interest.
---
Though if that's the only thing, I also remember it was also heavily level-zoned and based itself largely on fixed quests for level advancement in an era where even World of Warcraft is trying to implement level-scaling along with everything else it has to facilitate content engagement through queueing, but chances are it will get me to try it again due to the sandbox outside of it. Though I don't know if I've yet overcome the trauma of the cat-eared girls that licked themselves as idle animations.
---
Yes, pretty much all maps except for city maps and Southsun can give you a key. I've gotten keys from this map. It's about a one in five chance for a key in any zone as far as I can tell.
---
Your name game is on point, but yes, they were.
---
I'm still waiting on some of the basic Elonian assets from Path of Fire to become available to players. We're also still waiting for some of the human outfits *from launch* to be available to players.
---
And those new charr helmets look amazing. And the idea of tattoos and such is amazing.
---
But despite having such a reputation for milking the gem store, somehow ANet still keeps a ton of awesome assets as NPC-exclusive, and I don't know why.
---
These are great, makes me want to take a stab at fashion wars (pun not intended but I'll roll with it)! My engi is currently dressed kinda similar to #7. I just love that coat for some reason. very airship :) Adding the scarf to it in 9 is hilarious! But the stripes totally work for some reason.
---
What does accusation are levelled mean? In lay man terms
---
I completed 2 times, didnt get key, hmmn...is it RNG?
---
I have very little faith that it will actually manage to provide on that.  Even the worst p2w games manage to have some semblance of balance on launch.  It's only after the post-launch hype fades and the player count falls that the shitty monetization tactics come out.  Making buyable content that is actually attractive to players without providing power requires more resources than just making some stupid boost with no visual other than a buff icon that some intern drew up in 15 minutes.
---
If it ain't broke just, uh, keep using it and hope it doesn't break...
---
&gt;Players will play a game if it is fun, and and won't if its not.
---
You seem to be working on the assumption that people don't do PvP because they just don't know any better about how awesome it is and Anet needs to throw some motivation their way and they'll have their come to Jesus moment.
---
Again, people don't do PvP because of the P part. It wont matter what modes they add. Unless its something impossible to ignore no one will bother with it if they're not interested already. Thus it is up to the PvPers to convince the rest of us your company is worth our play time.
---
Players are the core of competitive modes. Try to think of it like running a guild. You need to prove that joining you is worth it. If no one wants to hang with you that's on you.
---
I specified "100%'ing episode achievements" and I meant that. It's irrelevant to that consideration that you can finish the episode mastery without finishing this specific achievement. You can't currently finish *the story journal's section* for this episode without it.
---
Moving the merchandise achievement the way they did with Patron and Koda's Blessing - putting them with other extravagantly expensive achievements (like the ones that require multiple legendaries) in Rare Collections and Tradesman, respectively - wouldn't be an unreasonable "fix" to the issue.   
---
That said, even if they moved it, it still looks like it'll be a good deal more expensive than even the legendary-collecting achievements. It obviously depends on what the visage prices settle at over time, but right now it's looking like upwards of 12k gold which is *wild*. Like 3-4 times as expensive as "obtain 18 unique pieces of legendary armor" kind of wild.
---
I'd personally rather be able to obtain the skins and finish the achievement, but I don't think there's inherently anything wrong with ridiculously expensive achievements. Achievements like this just don't belong in the story journal section.   
---
And arguably, items of this sort of rarity don't belong in achievements at all, but that's much more opinionated and if you disagree that's fine.
---
Gem store you know it
---
all masteries are part of expansions. The game is just telling you to "trigger" the expansion in order to start progressing trough the mastery system as you are lvl 80now.
---
It could do a better job at it, but atm i guess its coded this way
---
well it certainly helps me, and you're free to have your opinion, your wording just seemed a little bit unfriendly to me, im sorry if i misinterpreted that
---
I would absolutely love to see them revisit the core maps w/ the new, ***vastly*** improved systems.
---
However, that's never going to happen. Nothing ever changes. All zones are static. The world does not live.
---
^(please, *please* prove me wrong)
---
Noob question, but why is this worth so much?
---
oh the subscribers, idk why i haven't catched that lol
---
now it does say that on the website but the discord clearly states raffles, i don't know if thats enough to cause an infraction for patreon though, probably not.
---
Because GW2 is unceasingly human-centric.
---
If only this had been a Charr.
---
yes thats the whole idea, i was kinda memeing it, at this point they could scream in map chat to make people send paypal money for raffles, and it would be kinda the same thing but that would probably not be allowed eventhough it iss the same thing...
---
no I'm working under the assumption that people don't do pvp because pvp is shit.
---
Well then I guess it must be a Steam bug then. Case solved thank you, I'll just change the keybinds on how to open this and hope it wont trigger something else if gw2 thinks it's constantly pressed
---
1600gems, has unique /drink /laugh /threaten emotes

I got an i5 and it's not burning up. What's your excuse?

---
Ah thanks. It's unfortunate though... I really wanted this one. :/
---
Like many people already said, the game doesnt need better graphics, it needs to run better. 
---
Planetside 2 went from directx9 to 11 and the perfomance boost was noticable. I wish Anet could do the same.
---
Its really rare and it gives a visual effect on your character. ( Google if you want to see the effect)
---
Thats about it i guess.
---
If you dislike the effect its pretty worthless imo.
---
But one mans trash is anothers treasure
---
I’ve been doing those maps the past month or so, getting ascended trinkets for my new alt. They are definitely not dead. All S3 maps were populated almost all the time.
---
Means people are making posts and comments spreading the conclusion as truth, on reddit and elsewhere, including his own Discord server, right to his face.
---
We did not really become members of the shining blade..we are more a external agent with no obligations besides not going against the krytan throne.
---
Yep I'm always doing t1, atleast now since Im always waiting for that group that would suddenly pop up to binge for fractals but then party members suddenly quits and party dissolves :(
---
Couple weeks ago I found this post on reddit, I think it would be useful:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/94w1nd/crosspost_from_rcoolguides_colors_that_go_well/
---
It is possible that a version of this recipe you might drop doing the run randomly and that the Vendor version is Account Bound. Other random issues might include it being in an invisible bag (even if you are selecting from inventory you never know).
---
1. It's too rare to go after it. Droprates of the head piece are just retarded small. This will make 95% of players (I would guess even at least 80% of players interested in the skin) not chase it, because it's way more frustration than excitement
---
2. Only players that farmed A LOT of gold can just buy it. And the ones doing this are most likely "TP Barons" to control the prices of an item with way too low drop rate (they can easy buy all the supply and then put it on TP with higher price again)
---
3. Make it a tradeable ascended gear which will go account bound on EQ, then. That's something this games is missing anyway.
---
The difference between the mask and the infusions is, the mask is an actually desireable, well done and lore friendly armor skin, while infusions are 90% ugly crap, that shouldn't be in the game in the first place!
---
Gw2 was never a subscription game, only a buy to play
---
Ascended gear is extremely easy to get nowadays compared to the first days it was introduced
---
Most fractals are brain dead, easy and fast to do
---
The playerbase that will benefit the most are casuals, easy content even more easy for them and almost free stuff, people that get stuff so easily get bored and leave the game even faster. But guess what? Most of the casuals dont care about doing fractals, raids and so, the like the rewards but dont like the effort, and when they can't be carried they blame the system.
---
well, it is for me, because it's a well done and lore friendly armor skin. It's just completely out of reach for me.
---
There's an op condi roamer dare devil build which can solo most side noders, while having highest mobillity in the game by far. But ye let people tell you it's a crappy class. xD
---
1. Try pressing the right mouse button when moving around, I usualy just press it and w.
---
2. Depending on you class you will unlock some movement skills/bonus as well. Also mounts are xpac content (both xpac are bundle together right now so it's a pretty good deal right now, but don't worry about it right now)
---
3. servers don't matter (only for wvw) since the game is divided in mega servers.
---
4. You can craft bigger ones, also on the top right side of the inv you can auto-deposit crafting materials.
---
Bonus: lvl maps are 2012 maps, so new ones look much better. But take your time and have fun 🙂
---
Ps: sorry for any spelling mistake.
---
 
---
&gt;Unfamiliar and thus unbearably clunky controls. (My primary RPG experience is Dark Souls 3 on PC.)
---
Either you can learn the controls or change them, there will always be games with different controls then others, especially if the genre is different 
---
&gt;WALKING SPEED OF A SACK OF POTATOES (hopefully a ride will solve this problem)
---
Yes mounts make it better, but you also have waypoints all over them map and every class ( I think ) has somewhat of a speed buff
---
&gt;Chose  a server that's not too densely populated, making it take me like 5  mins of skill spamming to destroy a damned barricade (maybe it's  supposed to take forever? I dunno)
---
Servers only matter for World vs World other then that players are shared across all servers of a region. And if you have problem destroying a barricade maybe you do not enough damage with has nothing to do with player population. Enemies and Objectives of an event only get harder if there are more player doing the event.
---
&gt;NOT ENOUGH INVENTORY (I'm playing the f2p version... so..)
---
Buy [Salavge Kits](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Salvage_kit) to salvage unneeded armor and weapons into crafting materials, you can then put them directly in your material storage with the gear symbol in the top right corner of your inventory. But you can also buy bigger bags from the trading post or craft them yourself.
---
PvE: Easy to play Power DPS with either Daredevil or Deadeye (depends on the encounter), also some niche play as boon-support or special tasks for some raid bosses
---
PvP: As always, very powerful spike damage, mobility and stealth, just what you would expect from the class theme
---
WvW: Usually not used in zergs, but very potent roaming potential (also good for sniping off bad players that run around on their own)
---
This is why I came here, to have more intel. Any linky link to the build you are talking about ?
---
Thats also true for Raids. People let me play Condi Renegade on Sloth and Samarog without questioning it. If OP actually takes some time to learn the class i doubt that he will have any issues joining pugs.
---
I completed Dragonfall with 15 characters and didn't get a key. This can obviously be bad luck. Can someone deny or confirm this?
---
I would imagine (being a console game developer myself) that part of the issue with gw2 is that they continue to expand the budgets of what is drawn on screen as the years go by. So as new hardware has come along and the power of then average rig has increased, they’ve increased their internal budgets for how many textures, effects, characters, etc can be displayed on screen at once, as well as increasing the triangle count of meshes allowed. So to us end users, it never feels like things are getting better on the performance side, but the visuals fidelity of the content is getting better.
---
You dont want to make pve great again, what you want is more fractals and a focus on them. Sorry to say it but not everyone likes fractals and Pve is not only fractals. But now I see that this is your first post and your account was created today so I think you are just trolling.
---
&gt;Its 50/50
---
That's not how it works. Just because there are only 2 items in the drop table does not mean the drop percentage is split equally between those items. 
---
In drop tables, certain items have more "weight" or rarity than others. This means that even if there are only two items in the drop table, one can be significantly rarer. Such is the case with keys and transmutes when map completing.
---
This is a good general description of how item weight/rarity works in games: 
---
https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/DanielCook/20141215/232300/Loot_drop_best_practices.php
---
If you mouse over the number of poi or Vista's you have left for map completion then they glow and become very clear.
---
Damn, I love the artstyle! Wish I could get something like this for my DnD character!

Only for cannonball.

But only a few of them are available at the moment. Most of then need to be unlocked with future Wild-Eye Miller events

I like the WvW staff daredevil build. I'm just a solo guy who usually follows around the zergs. I'm by no means an expert at WvW, but hopping around in zerg fights usually leads to decent damage which makes me think im contributing a little. It also holds its own in smaller scale though it's not necessarily for that. Thief is definitely way up there for PvP though, both modes. Daredevil, Deadeye, and Core can all be used in WvW effectively. Probably sPvP too.
---
You and the guy of which you took the slogan from have one thing in common. Terrible ideas.
---
Dang bruh, your art style is hella good AND hella interesting.  Keep up the good work!  Also, you have a website of your work I can bookmark?
---
Salty bois at their prime haha.
---
People can't get that some people are better than them.
---
i hope you made it in time for Shadow Behemoth
---
all i want is just some pants for light armor that are not skin tight or overly puffy.
---
Basically anything that the Elonian npc's are wearing.
---
This just in: shiittalker in competitive game mode. More at 11.
---
[removed]
---
How, its not nearly at max usage.
---
I did tried it only to see the world and it did look really good even without these changes shown in the video; the worst thing was that game never got full voice-over and NPCs were randomly talking Korean (pretty sure same thing happens in BDO).
---
I had no problems on lowest settings. Do you see other players picking them up?
---
gw2 is a single core game, usage is for all cores. your one core is maxed when playing gw2 and that's it. to get more frames you would have to get a cpu with better single core performance
---
Are you sure you didnt set frame limit to 60 in game (or maybe in your GPU settings if that's a thing)?
---
I really start to like my thief after all these years. I don't know, it was a class I always had trouble with, just couldn't get my head around it.
---
Recently I did some map completion with him and tried to go for a more power-based build and I love it!
---
Thats sad. Is there anyway to fix it without buying a new CPU ?
---
I've gotten 3 transmutation charges and one key, so I will corroborate the yeses.
---
I'm curious: what about the player progress within AA? Are they going to just seamlessly transfer all playerbase to this new model or going start anew with new servers? If they do plan then what about all those who got spent money on stuff? Will they get some VIP bonuses anyway?
---
In GW2 no and in the GPU settings not too, I get why more FPS in other games.
---
Thank you for this! It looks really good.
---
you could try [https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases) it can help, but don´t expect miracles
---
I will thanks
---
...
---
Hva you tried "Elonian Pants"?
---
You jest, I'm sure, but this was basically the gist of my reason for playing the Vanishing of Ethan Carter, and at the start, the Witness as well(until I got hooked into the puzzles of those)
---
Gtx 770 at 100 FPS my dude. Game is old
---
no he's 100% correct, it's been spoken.
---
No... Arena Net should put all of their resources in new content and don't spend work on graphics. When they have proven that they can deliver on content, we can talk about an overhaul update. But I rather get more frequent content instead of nicer graphics.
---
Guild wars runs much better on intel CPUs cuz they usually have around 25%more single core perf compared to AMD.. one i5 9600k would be more productive than ryzen 5 and accordingly i7 9700 or 9700k &gt; ryzen 7. Never go for AMD if you plan on playing gw.. its just not made for multiple core.. and runs on dx9 which is great GPU bottleneck.. dx12 thingy may help a lot in your case.
---
Nope.
---
I'm an engi main cause masochism I guess?
---
Don't get me wrong, GW1 can be beautiful, but in many places its age shows.
---
Okay, so it is more about the performance of the game than the capped FPS.
---
Yes, that is the general problem with GW2 as others have said already. The problem is, you will not be able to change that unless you help yourself to a few things.
---
Generally, reducing player model limit and quality to low or lowest will be the best thing you can do to get more FPS. However, this will mean that you see fewer players and them looking more generic.
---
As another comment has pointed out there is an 3rd party add-on which translates the DirectX 9 calls from GW2 to DirectX 12 calls. You can get it [here](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy) but it might not give you the FPS you look for since AFAIK it has more impact on lower end hardware.
---
So, in the end, you will, unfortunately, have to live with it.
---
Because I can travel back in time to when countless nerfs haven't happened.
---
Thats really sad, but I will try it. Thanks
---
&gt; GW1, however, could use a graphics overhaul
---
I think if they brough everything up to EotN standrs it'd be completely fine even today.
---
We already have this.
---
this goes for deadeye maybe, but daredevil has tons of cleave and performs really well in fractals
---
&gt; graphics are content for many players.
---
How.. like, *how*..?
---
Content is something you play. How do you play better textures?
---
With the ascended food it is both magi trinkets + 1 concentration infusion and you are 1 or 2 points over cap (depends on what you wield in that moment)
---
Why is this getting downvotes?  This is a bug and should be getting more attention.  The reward track in both pvp and wvw for icebrood saga resets at daily reset.   I've seen this myself too.
---
Oh, so you can play hide‘n‘seek with guild members without un-representing the guild. A referee can still have this on and control your movement.
---
(Like my guild would ever do something like this ...)
---
Spectral Grasp turns 5 fights into 1.
---
I love power dragonhunter because traps &lt;3
---
All good suggestions, if none of that works then wait for a patch- not because they're likely to fix it stalling, but because it will force new copies of the map.
---
For T4 only a lot of ppl will still accept Chrono Druid or even full Scourge or 4 Scourge and a Druid..... and so on.   
---
T4 only isn't endgame anyway.
---
Endgame Fractals are CMs+T4 and you do them without any healer...
---
Snuro, is that you? O_O
---
Despite me wanting an optimization for gw2, let's state 2 things  the reason your 1080ti can't hold 60fps on GW2 is simple the problem it's not your GPU it's your CPU. Blizzard has resources Ante won't have, plus they've been updating their motor by little by little GW2 uses the same as GW1 probably improved but still it's harder than you people make it. On the other hand the numberof particles and complexity of those in WoW vs GW2 is laughable.
---
In the end improving the graphic won't make that much of a change in your performance since it will always be bottleneck by your CPU not being able to process all the artifacts.
---
Don't have the link, sorry
---
Warrior.
---
Nomad thief?

http://press.ncsoft.com/product.asp?s=61
---
Yeah, I was there for the ride at release. Bugs,, balance issues, hacking galore. Playerbase was begging for some relatively simple changes to help alleviate the problems; instead the first update came stuffed with p2w garbage and not much else. That's why player numbers cratered so soon after release. 
---
I'll believe their new direction when it's been in that direction for some time.
---
&gt; plus they've been updating their motor by little by little GW2 uses the same as GW1 probably improved but still it's harder than you people make it
---
it's not, WoW had a lot more legacy to deal with than gw2. WoW came out long before gw1
---
also, saying gw2 is the same engine "but a bit improved" is a massive disservice to all the effort that's gone into it. compare gw1 to 2, and the changes are absolutely massive.
---
Yeah it's just cookie cutter s/d sage build. Which is why I was surprised at the salt in his wounds. And ranger can kite a weaver as this was just a strait up duel...
---
The best thing is he is now on friend list so I get to troll his ass lol.
---
If Im losing health I can hit my bulwark gyro and suddenly I'm okay.
---
I play Staff condi mirage in open world and for chilled dungeon runs. Just take the Infinite Horizon Mirage grandmaster, get 3 clones up and laser them to oblivion. Nothing will really become dangerous to you because you can telport with staff 2 and if you skill Chaos with "Descend into Madness" you can drop 2 Chaosstorms at the same time whats also fun for stationary encounter.
---
But you can also run a well chronomancer in open world tbh. The elite is quiet funny against groups of enemies and Sword has some nice cleave plus the invuln skill 2 that also dishes out good damage.
---
I would never pay for this game if it was on a subscription. I barely justify the ffxiv sub to myself, and this game isn't ffxiv. ANet would need to put in a lot of work to make this game worthy of having a subscription fee.
---
And yeah like other replies said, it never was, and it wasn't really any better than it is now when it was just buy to play.
---
The biggest issue for me is that there's just too much dead content that isn't possible to do solo. Collections and achievements tied to meta events that are rarely run anymore, when collections and achievements are GW2s only real end-game. Fractals replaced dungeons, ANet let dungeons die, why would they prioritise fractals? The LFG system is still antiquated when other MMOs implemented raid finders/duty finders/matchmaking *years* ago, and even the casual community is so obsessed with meta that a lot of people avoid it entirely.
---
I made a Guardian, was okay. Upgraded to Dragonhunter DPS and I'm not drowning in pussy. My Tinder has never been so active since I added that to my profile!
---
You describe optical illusion
---
You're welcome!
---
Ehhh - not exactly for me. Even highlighted it will miss if movement is too big or distance is too far. But it definitely helps.
---
i'll echo what other people are saying:  
---
we need optimizations and back-end upgrades so that most people can max out the graphics options.  
---
  
---
on max settings, the game actually looks really, really good.
---
9 map completions, 2 keys. Which is a bit lower than the global ~33% drop rate, but not statistically significantly lower.
---
Make Guild Wars 2 subscription base again
---
lel may be you played another game but gw2 was NEVER ever sub based...
---
Herald is bad cause it is has no burst, renegade is much better in that regard.
---
Dps renegade can do 80k burst, it's not amazing, but way better than herald.
---
And this is the point where we all have to ask: Why? Why do they not want their only game to be future-proof? Or is GW3 in the making?
---
Sadly it is bad luck. I completed 12 maps with my mesmer this summer and didn't get any key.
---
Yeaa.. And then some random user DX12 mod appears and the bottleneck vanishes. To me, it's a shame that a modder can fix the engine in a way ArenaNet can not.
---
I can't decide. Every class has a fun way to play. Even when I was burnt out, watching Boot's builds usually renews my interest. I personally gravitate towards support builds as I have a knack at looking at a big picture with a good timing. Currently I am working in support scrapper rotation. It feels very rewarding to be the pillar of sustain in my WvW Zerg.
---
You will learn how to move quicker soon, there are many skills that have some kind of teleport or buffs that  give 33% to movement speed. 
---
Like every MMORPG, everything is boring and slow in the beginning. The fun starts once you gain more skills
---
I'd say that having charr in Ebonhawke's military would be impossible once word got out.
---
Necros, because the salt of PvPers losing all their boons to you never gets old. Your boonspam is a disease and I am the cure.
---
That and I can just dive in every fight without a plan. It will always work out just fine. For me at least, the rest of party has to be picked up, again.
---
https://imgur.com/a/emSLe - Got a gallery of mostly Norn NPC outfits but a couple others too that I'm still waiting for.
---
Not sure why the controls bothering you. Did you re-bind A and D to strafe rather then turn? Because when that is done it is like any other MMO and very smooth movements.
---
That's not how optimization works. Gw2 like high single core IPC. Which ryzen gen 1 lacks in.  
---
That being said 60fps is more than good. Much better than I would expect on a ryzen gen 1. If your monitor can't do higher anyway what's the point.  
---
If you really want better FPS modernizing to Ryzen gen 3 will help but not by any large margin.
---
RNG is always RNG so you will likely get the transmutation charge and sometimes a key.
---
It helps if you bring in a build that can easily carry others.
---
Ele cause i just love staff so much. Tons of range, taging, aoes, aoe cc, METEOR SHOWERS!!
---
Revs i enjoy for their animation, and how much all their specialization /legends / weapons can combine and stack their effects and combos with eachother, and how much i can take "short cuts" on gear stats cause i got traits that back them up (double fury effect +33% crit chance with invocation/ renegade traits.
---
Necro minions are so fun for me, and power /boon reaper with gs is a beast.
---
Thieves i love cause stealth play, in jp, dungeons, even wvw..but are too glass cannony for me.
---
Rangers i love cause of their theme and weapon sets, best " adventurer" profession out there. Also some racial armors look great for them.
---
Warriors , if built so, can be an unstoppable beast, and getting back from downed with vengeance and finishing the hard fight is the best feeling in the world.
---
Also, their large amount of weapons, and weapon combinations can look awesome as well
---
There's also the "hidden" Charr horns that are only available with some gender swapping shenanigans. You can get the Olmakhan horns if you choose a particular style in the makeover kit, then switch gender. The female Charr get the small horns with the very cool blue particle effect, and male Charr can get the wide horns with ornaments hanging from them. It's been a bug since that episode released, but I wish they would make it formal and let male Charr get the blue particle effect horns (and vice versa) legitimately.
---
Oh hey dreoxy
---
Gw2 expansion maps are plenty beautiful tho. I'd like to see only the main cities improved a bit, buy only if they gonna start putting some events in other cities instead of everything being in lions arch and divinity reach
---
&gt;I started as a Salvari
---
&gt;I'm the type of person who really enjoy the fine details of a story telling.
---
Hmmm...
---
Greatest  
---
Guild Wars 2  
---
Event  
---
Hands DOWN
---
Playing a Mesmer is rough, since its a class unique to Guild Wars.
---
It has a focus on managing the conditions of a fight, reading an enemy tell, and  indirect damage with conditions and using your illusions to carry your spells and damage in packets.
---
It became really fun when I learned to use the AI against itself.
---
Torment causing damage when an enemy moves and Confusion when they use a skill will have foe killing themselves before they can lay a hand on you.
---
Learn all the weapons you can and figure out what you are good at.
---
I am currently using Scepter/Focus and Greatsword.
---
It was pretty insane. Lol
---
Reliable but not particularly overpowered with pistol main hand and nothing offhand. You get a spammable 5bleeds for 2 initiative. Pretty fun condi build
---
When Jormag shows up with an army of corrupted mankitties the news will spread pretty fast. :)
---
Can't wait her to be poisoned by Stoneglow or something.
---
You're running around doing all the trivial side-story crap without first doing the associated personal story and you can't figure out why the side-story crap doesn't make sense? Imagine a great trilogy of books, and the author also wrote some short stories in the same universe/timeline/world. You're basically reading just the short stories and wondering why you don't understand the current geopolitical situation.
---
The game was not designed for you to first do 100% map completion of each zone. The first thing you should do is your personal story up to the point where it matches/exceeds your level. Then use the map events to level yourself up and generate currency so you can afford better gear so you can continue your personal story. After you're done with the personal story, then go back and do 100% map completion on each zone.
---
I'd guess warrior or reaper.
---
Does the mark stay on a player who is on the Warclaw after dismounting him?
---
That's awesome!
---
I'm not an "Elder Commander".
---
Help the dredge

She wasn't either, for most of her life.
---
&gt; Ryzen 5 1600X, both are only at an usage of about 50%
---
That 50% usage is for the entire CPU. If one core is at 100% and the other 5 are completely unused, that'll display as 16% CPU usage. If you go check your individual core/thread usage, you'll most likely find one or two threads at 100% and several more at 25% to 50%.
---
Sylvari personal story is great and they are honestly a really unique race. Anet doesn't know what to do with them, but the foundation is there.
---
Maybe I'm not clear about it. I do that. I always do the Personal Story when It's up. But the Salvari Level 20 personal Story for example has no connection to Brisban Wildlands. I'm pretty happy with the Personal Story actually like I mentioned.
---
I’m convinced, y u cheat ! ?
---
Tell us how you managed to make a speed hack that only effects your healing skill and that actually works! 
---
/s obviously
---
&gt; intel CPUs cuz they usually have around 25%more single core perf compared to AMD
---
Bullshit. That was true years ago, but is no longer true on a $/$ comparison.
---
1. Easy to catch up still people (low or high level) running low maps and every dungeon content is fast to find a group if you open a group.
---
2. in pvp i can’t talk about unranked, but im in high gold/low plat and no issues finding games. queues go from 0-240 sec most of the time. WvW is currently very dependent on which server you are on (mixed languages server links introduced on EU). 
---
3. In Raids popular are Chronos, Druids but most classes work too. in fractals you would probably want a renegade or firebrand. i’d say all classes are used but in my opinion the most useful overall in pve pvp and wvw are Mesmers and Guardians currently.
---
What's wrong with Salvari? I actually found couple of threads in the reddit say they have the best all around Personal story.
---
Looks awesome, now the only thing missing is "US" the allmighty Elder Pact Commander Champion Comeback from the death and killer of Elder dragons
---
I just realize, we pretty much have all the titles lol.
---
It's actually 20-25 % , according to anything where people actually tested.
---
Beautiful love it❤
---
Story gets better at level 80 with HoT and PoF, the zones and maps is there for you to level and stuff, think of the story missions like episodes ^^
---
Sorry for bad grammer, am getting better tho
---
You're both blocked for me now, cause you're both idiots.
---
I did. There’s a difference between typing short messages on reddit on a phone or PC while doing other obligations and sitting down and dedicate focused attention to a game for 30-40 minutes. I happened to be grilling and trying to get my daughter to poop on the potty for most of that time responding yesterday if you must know.
---
Then you've taught me some new things! I'm ok that those didn't make it into the video though, this is starting to leave the realm of "tips for a new druid" and enter "endgame fight build, do it this way only".
---
Based on an older engine is a perfectly viable point if they issues of the current engines are based on its age.
---
The lack of multi core scaling and the animation rigs that limit armor designs are obviously the result of recycling old trash rather than building something new.
---
Ah crap I just noticed! :O :( I'll fix it asap.
---
Then don't play ranger.
---
if only 8)
---
Warrior- Simple but rewarding- it's fun!
---
Oh hey Ninja_sloth
---
For GW2, I'd take an i3 8350k and overclock it, over any Ryzen cpu. Ring bus &gt; IF
---
Thats still one of the worst points of HoT.
---
Having to either beg in map chat for help or relying on a HP train that results in not doing anything isnt good gameplay either way.
---
No, LFG is already ridiculously cluttered with too many tabs, and making it even more difficult to find a raid squad when raids are already pretty dead after Thursday is a terrible idea
---
I think it would be ok as long they would not transfer the gold to a single account
---
You don't become a Shining Blade member, you just take the same Oath that they do so you don't spill your secrets.
---
But for the 100th time the commander does not join the Shining Blade.
---
Conpare the latest GW2 map with the original. Oroginal looks better. Dont get me wrong, I dont mind and live GW2
---
Why? It's in your possession either way.
---
Thanks! No worries, English is not my main langague too and I'm doing tons of Grammar mistake :-)
---
&gt;t I already paid for the game once and don’t relish the idea
---
Your loss.
---
Sounds like you enjoy making lots of assumptions on what my life is like. I happened to be stretching after a gym workout.
---
Feel free to make more assumptions, though. Obviously you’ve shown that your comments are useless. Have a great day!
---
AA unchained is basically a fresh start server / game with another buisness model. If you have spend already you can happily play on already existing servers where spending is still a thing.
---
Then I'm not sure what you meant by "completionist" . To me , part of that is collecting skins. And without spending $$$ , you'll have a hard time.
---
You do you meanwhile I will enjoy myself and have a blast in that game. Gw2 is becoming stale. No content at all.
---
Because then people would buy multiple account to reap the rewards which ramps up over time. Unlike say buying gems once for that value.
---
Which then makes people buy multiple accounts for profit only.
---
How did you underclock your GPU and by how much?
---
It is
---
That's exactly what some people do.

Use the scarf too if you can get one for the shoulders. Adds a great look to it!

Moral of the story: Don't PUG.
---
Longest title ever. :D
---
because its a negative for the community aspect of mmos
---
make 100000 different choices, 10 which are viable and the rest is shit (thats just the nature of choices), make group content, majority of every playerbase is casual, casuals want to do group content, get gatekept either by the elitist who want you to run one of the 10 viable choices or by the game being balanced around those 10 choices.
---
[You forgot the text.](https://i.imgur.com/TTW9dGj.jpg)
---
It's because devs knew most players are not like you. This was intentional so they could speed run the game. If you want the lore then you are doing exactly the right thing. You are just not being forced to do it, or spoon fed like they do in other games like elder scrolls online for example. Don't get me wrong; it's a wonderful game. 
---
You'll notice in expansion content the are sometimes no hearts at all or they are kept to a minimum for the reasons you've mentioned. Instead you have to pay attention to any ambient dialogue that might turn into an event chain or meta event. There's a surprising amount of lore sometimes.
---
I think you are thinking of "conveyed".
---
Aurene will kill us all, nice art tho!
---
Yea not sure of what is said in the discord. He probably has the language changed on pateron to avoid that.
---
Well, no.
---
You know a lot of 2 year olds that use Reddit?
---
Nope!
---
There's a similar helmet to one of them, but on charr it looks like it'll just slip right off since it's just a plate on the face and nothing looking like it'd hold it in place. (Except superglue, maybe)
---
&gt; I had to spend around 10 minutes reading and navigating dialogues of NPCs and patching up pieces to understand why I'm killing Grubs.
---
You should probably think of the Commander as a force of nature that stays in shape in between world-shattering events by cutting a bloody swath across Tryia.
---
It's Death Cardio.
---
People said that for all the outfits/skins in Path of Fire, and we know how that turned out so...
---
Yeah just sage instead of menders as that hits like a wet noodle at best.
---
if it says something along the lines of "degenerate" I'm not even against it tbh
---
Not saying you can't have fun with it, just that i'm not rushing to jump back into their arms after being done so dirty :D
---
I don’t play the class, but I suspect that that’s a solid number to pull, depending on your gear and what boss you were on. 
---
If my Renegade had those kinds of numbers in my CM runs I would be pretty happy. 
---
You may want to compare your rotation to the one found on the SC website, to tie any possible loose ends: 
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/alacrity/
---
Also, I suggest bringing CC bundles as Ren, to make for quick breakbars for maximum DPS.
---
Itll depend on your group composition and your buffs but the raid build has a support renegade power dps build doing 28k on golem so you should be aiming realistically for 20k on most bosses.
---
You get to laugh at all the dead bodies while you chill in your shroud
---
It is this one: https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Installing
---
It is also included in the GW2 Addon Launcher: https://github.com/fmmmlee/GW2-Addon-Manager
---
AFAIK it was not officially approved bei ANet, but it's code is open now and was checked for malware by some people. Also, i did not hear of anyone getting banned for this as of yet (and i think quite a lot of people use it).

And when finally they get a kill, he will roll highest on Invincible and go 'Why do you think I came all this way?'

Your CPU is the bottleneck.
---
You'll want something with higher single core performance.
---
this can only be a stepping stone for using a finger
---
there is alot of stuff cycling out today.
---
Pay debts!
---
What do you mean? :p
---
Looks like an expansion cover , oh well .
---
Rofl that's absolutely untrue unless you're playing against a group of 50 new players with no commander
---
I love all of your pictures. And you know that :3
---
I could add retail stickers if you want? 😉
---
Time-gating the materials allows for players to earn some gold by selling the materials to other players instead of using them themselves, since items aren't lost on death and are never destroyed
---
No offense , but it didn't make sense. I literally don't understand what you said.
---
I'm just sharing something that doesn't happen (to me at least). It's not something skillfull but extremely lucky and I thought it would be interesting
---
That's exactly what I ended up doing!
---
Time-gating materials increases their value, as only one can be made per day. That means that if 10,000 players want to make the item, only 10,000 can be made that day. If those players have materials to make more, they have to wait another day. They can choose whether to keep the item themselves or sell it. If they need to use the item, it's cheaper to be patient and craft it each day until they have enough, but if they want it now, they can pay more buy it from other players through the trading post.
---
I mean.. 3 hrs is enough to give me a "first impression" don't you think?
---
Or you just ask in chat "How do I avoid the shockwave with knockback" and someone will say "Step on the white circle opposite of the one the boss is facing while preparing the attack and jump+glide when the shockwave is coming close".
---
What are the first two in the bottom pic?

I do enjoy debuffs, so I think Mesmer is working out for me.

So far I've tried out scepter and one hand sword on the main hand, and a.. torch? On the right hand.
---
I think I like scepter better on my main hand than one hand sword.

I was reading this up again, because I wasn't sure if you really have access to PvP from the beginning. The UI element is hidden until level 22 but you can still set a keybind in your setting to open the "Structured PvP" interface. From there you can teleport to the mists (the PvP lobby).
---
You can read up on all level and time restricted things here:  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Limitations](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Limitations) 
---
But most things won't concern you because it's your first character anyways.
---
I used to love engineer so much. Up until HoT most of my playtime was engineer on every content. With HoT and scrapper, it became "pvp and wvw roaming only" for me. Then I started to play other professions more. Then with PoF, one of my engineers is just a scrapper heal bot. I have now 3 of each profession but only 2 engineers. I dislike playing with current engineer. I loved old nades, bombs, all the kaboom. Yep, it became "why I dislike my go to profession now" comment instead. Maybe engineer didn't change much at all, but confusion changed, animations and coefficients changed and everything else is just much stronger unless I grab lasers and heat.
---
TLTR: I love them all but not current engineer.
---
Well... Thats mesmerizing.
---
Do you ping your legendary materials before making one, and after making it too? Please tell me you do.
---
Murakai's secret hobby
---
Doesn't everyone?  It is part of the fun of making one, and I remember reading something on the GW2 box about 'fun' back in the day.
---
&gt; No reason other than they don't want you to finish stuff too quickly.
---
Pretty sure it also has to do with balancing the economy of the game.  If people could make unlimited ascended mats every day, what's to stop the people with 40-million toons from doing mining runs and flooding the market with deldrimor ingots?
---
It can be frustrating, especially when it's new content so there's no way to plan ahead and make things ahead of time.
---
Laverna thank you for doing these HP runs , I've joined them on at least 5 characters so far .
---
No, I haven't got one yet, but yeah I would link the shit out of them. Tell me, what's up your but today?
---
Yes, the controls are something I will have to keep testing.
---
I supposed I'm too weak to do much?
---
And I did not read up much, and not having played a game with multiple servers before, I didn't know that!
---
I will keep an eye out for those handy salvage kits.
---
Thank you :)
---
Strike Missions can't be a stepping stone for raids if they don't demonstrate how brutal raids can be. Raids are about following the mechanics of the fight, trial-and-error (until someone puts up a guide or you have a raid lead who explains the fight for you), and being good at your rotations. A boss with a one-shot gimmick is...something, but that's not really how raids go -- in most cases your raid as a whole is punished when someone fails a mechanic, but its rare that it outright kills you because you failed to hit the dodge button (Samarog comes to mind). OP's suggestions for the next mission would be good, though, assuming that it demonstrates that when you fail something, the whole raid suffers _something_, as a result.
---
As is, strike missions are weird, to me, because they're designing for something that both ends of the spectrum will not get mileage out of. 
---
To non-raiders, Strike Missions can feel like 'Why not just design a dungeon' because they put in all this effort to create an area to traverse through and a boss that is ultimately 'dodge the attacks and is a pinata, but kill it fast for more loot'.
---
To raiders, it's a laughable joke of an encounter.
---
Y'know... this made me realize that the Commander and Aurene are the only two beings in Tyria that have come back from the dead now... (that are still alive, Joko you don't count here)
---
I had no clue!
---
Perhaps I was supposed to read things more carefully haha
---
Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not, but gonna guess you are.
---
Uh, sorry?
---
I just wanted to share since I got excited :/
---
 [Magician Legs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magician_Legs_(skin)) \[&amp;CiIAAAA=\] 
---
With colors to match the skin in one of the channels
---
this is the reason i love playing pvp, even when its a loss its just so satisfying, close games are the best
---
I mean the most recent person in the entire tyria and more that has done this, is "US".
---
Not to say, that we pretty much did What the gods couldnt even face.
---
Just so you guys know, my main (story pve) character is a Guardian Female using bioluminesence set with white and blue color, and the dragon shattered wings, im just waiting for my time to be able to fly already like a dragon or be made into a god lol
---
she's got the elonian mask, racing scarf, spearmarshal's jerkin, sneakthief gloves, elonian leggings and elonian boots!
---
&gt; No, I'm not sorry that my words hurt your feelings.
---
Reality of a situation is a painful thing, isn't it?
---
1. Will consider doing that.
---
2. Looking forward to unlocking that mvmnt skill!
---
3. I had no clue that was the case :/
---
4. So the friend of mine accidentally clicked that button and started freaking out that all his items are gone, so I started freaking out. But I guess it was a good thing!
---
Lastly, I do like the way the map looks even in the low lvl area. Looking forward to the rest!
---
The guardian is lovely for the magic knight fantasy, while the ranger is enjoyable with her pets.
---
Having said that, none of the classes are up there with my favourite classes of all time. They are not really bad, but I would gladly give them all up for classes like GW1 mesmer, necro, ritualist or ranger or D3's witch doctor. The whole "skills being tied to weapons" really killed a lot of my GW2 enjoyment ...
---
Shrug.  You can keep trying to punch up if you want, but it's not going to get you far.
---
Not sure if I understood the first point.
---
Are you saying that A and D are turns when combined with right mouse button?
---
Yes.
---
That is correct, but if an area is still blurred out it should be obvious where you need to go to find the rest of your map completion, so it only becomes an issue if you're unaware of a map's shape/size.
---
I think overall it was OK.  Certainly a step up compared to leveling the other professions from 400-500.
---
The only part I didn't like was having to wait for the event in the Charr collection.  It was only 5 minutes or so, but still, would rather have just kept moving the collection forward.
---
Will be interesting to see what they do for Jewellery.
---
Guardian: Greatsword 3&gt;5&gt;4&gt;2 swap hammer, pop quickness 2&gt;1&gt;1&gt;1&gt;1 swap back to Greatsword repeat and deploy traps or spirit weapons as needed.
---
Lol, no, you can't hurt my feelings. You're a nobody. I just think that being that negative in life has to be lonely. I know people like you IRL and I avoid them at all costs.
---
The highlight doesn't factor into it. As long as your click/shot happens while the dot is directly on the balloon it will track and hit it. I've tested it on far balloons that won't highlight with the dot on it and when trying to lead the shot and then did the same with up close balloons that would highlight without the dot being directly on it. If the dot is on the balloon when you fire it will hit and with the dot off (even with a highlight) will miss.
---
Vacate these premises!
---
Any resolve on this? I am also having this issue.
---
In the Deimos fight, you get saul saying shit like "Get to the ward, quickly!" If this is present in raids, why should it not be present in stepping stone content? It's not a bad idea to have a helpful commander npc that kind of guides new players through.
---
being 300 points behind and still winning is a "never give up" scenario.
---
but 2 points behind? hell nah.
---
Let the boobs be free.
---
You are right. We want the same screenshot of the same PvP screen, people posting their first legendary and people posting world completion.
---
Bonus points if you take a picture of your screen with your phone.
---
&gt; You played the game for three hours. Your Comparison to Dark Souls 3  doesn't really hold up in this case because those are two totally  different games with vastly different combat systems ...
---
Yes, indeed. I did re-edit the post, but I really didn't mean to bash on GW2 for being subpar to DS or something on that line. That note on DS was to explain (which I miserably failed) as to why I found the controls on GW2 to be clunky for me. GW2 and DS are undoubtedly different. Heck, I struggle with Witcher 3 which is much more similar to DS than GW2 in terms of controls. 
---
I do have to say that so far DS's combats are much more fast paced than what I've seen, as a lvl 8 human Mesmer in GW2 so far (again, only lvl 8, so please forgive me if I'm not talking about end game combats). I don't like turtling in DS (Well specifically DS3) and much prefer a fast-paced combat. On the other hand, maybe it's the low level, Mesmer, or me, but takes much longer time for me to kill anything or get killed (which I am yet to experience, thankfully). In terms of number of hits, the MOBs 3 levels lower than my Mesmer take a decent number of hits to get killed when using a scepter. While I don't quite remember exactly how many, but it's on par with when I'm killing Gundyr, the tutorial boss. It is needless to say that the special event ones (more raid-boss like ones?) are a complete bullet sponge in comparison to what I'm used to. It almost feels like when I was doing a no-level-up run on DS3 and fighting mid-game bosses in terms of how many times I need to hit them! Obviously, DS is not an MMORPG. Hell, I doubt ppl will even want to play it if it were an MMORPG. I am not used to MOBs that multiple ppl need to be attacking at the same time to kill them. 
---
Anyhow, this was supposed to be an aside that got really long. I hope this gives you a better idea as to why I sounded disappointed by the combat so far though. It's mostly unfamiliarity due to the short playtime (as you and many others pointed out) and completely new genre of game than anything else.
---
&gt; Only, that it doesn't work that way. Which World (server) you are on  ONLY matters for World vs World vs World the "battlegrounds" PvP type of  game mode in which 3 Worlds fight over 4 maps with siege engines. 
---
This I didn't know until I started reading all the comments here. Thank you for the info.
---
&gt; As for "taking forever", yes and no. The problem is that many players  can and feel weak when they don't pay attention to their equipment and  their focused damage type. 
---
I mean sure, I was hitting the barricades with my scepter which arguably was doing less damage than the one hand sword with extra pluses with pretty colors when it came to individual hits. But I thought the illusions were helping out. Maybe not. I wasn't paying much attention to DPS and stuff and I probably should. 
---
&gt; Also, click on the gear icon at the top right corner and select "deposit  all" so that every single crafting material will be send directly to  your material storage in your bank. This should free up a lot of stuff.  Salvage or sell the gear you can't or don't want to use. 
---
So the friend I was playing with did that and started freaking out that all of his items disappeared. I guess it was a good thing it did, so I will start smashing that button!
---
Thank you for your comment :)
---
Okay I see it’s to aim. Now from the posts i actually did think that he’s doing something shady. Is this situation still going on or it’s 200% determined he’s guilty/not guilty of suspicious activity? Like other thanRMT and giving weapon to alt accounts was there a third legit alternative possibility to him giving away all the free prizes?
---
Imagine in case a sequel to Guild Wars 2 in far future does come out what a legend would our character would be, "Their race is forgotten even the weapons they held are forgotten, what is remembered though is how they killed dragons, united Tyria, defeated the last mursaat, killed one of the human gods, freed Elona from a lich, conquered death itself and raised an elder dragon from egg.... The list goes on, it is unknown if such a person ever existed, but one thing is for sure, the Commander is one of the most revered titles in all of Tyria in honor of that legend."
---
Oh dear
---
If you miss the first shot you eon't need to reload to start a new streak.
---
Yeah, I see other people picking them up and using them. I've tried on the lowest and highest settings but either way I don't see any indicators on the ground.
---
Well, yeah, but if you only need to hit 10 without missing, how would you never need more than 10 bullets, which is a max of 1 reload.
---
But that’s why you make the legendary!!
---
Maybe even their weapons and something special for every profession, a smaller grave beside incase you were a ranger, a few banners and weapons if warrior, an arrangement of skulls and candles for Necro and so on.... Or who knows maybe the Commander will make a comeback like Red in Pokemon, give us all of them nostalgia and feels then poof away.
---
hey, it did come in handy to enlighten me about something i completely agree with
---
We have all the ground-targeting!
---
good sir :)
---
I like to consume them in real life.
---
nice one!
---
Being able to take on anything, any time, anywhere.
---
If you are commanding a zerg, FB is great and it’s not as easy as you say. 
---
But whatever... scrapper is amazing, it cleans conditions super fast, gives superspeed for moving out of damage and engaging where you want, and it stealths your group either by bomb smoke, or gyro in movement. 
---
I like the tempest healer but I really think scrapper is more useful and is easier to use while moving your zerg.
---
There are so many great artist here on Reddit, I'm glad to see your drawings! It's awesome!
---
Why you keep the first 2 items? Both are consumables that awards 5000 karma, so why not consume them?
---
I don't think you know what a wall of text means.
---
PvP u have condi or core sword/dagger. D/P daredevil gutted with 600 range steal nerf. Check out sindrenerr or valun
---
&gt; I was hitting the barricades with my scepter
---
That is what I was talking about, while I'm not a mesmer player it seems that the Scepter is more of a condition weapon and not direct damage. Most of the Attacks apply a lot of Torment which damages the enemy over time.
---
You should have used the sword instead which is more direct damage focused. Most core tyria "objects" like Barricades don't allow conditions on them so you will take ages hitting them with a condition weapon because most of your damage with those weapons are, well, conditions.
---
There is more raid training value in the concert meta and the flame meta than in the strike mission. 
---
You get greens and marble mechanics with break bars and multi person mechanics like the torch relay.
---
Now that's a racist that knows how to kill time
---
I lost it at Poncho Playa.
---
It's true that it sucks.
---
Oh everything ruins pvp according to everyone.
---
Okay, so I have hope on that one. Remember that magazine Anet released a few weeks back, showing off things coming in the Saga? Jora's descendant was wearing the raven shaman top, but with actual light armour pieces on the rest of her. Normally its just shown as a full set on NPC's like an outfit.
---
I suspect that the shaman raven top will be a new armour skin you can get, and they may have broken up other shaman outfits into armour too. We'll know for sure when episode 1 drops, probably.
---
wow.. Didn't know when you was born your mothers cunt was still attached to you to be this much of one.
---
Heal Ren and Scourge don't provide much regen. Firebrand, Tempest, Scrapper, Druid all do though, I would say its better to make sure you have Regen than not.
---
To not be an arsehole randomly for no reason and instead to go out and actually sort out your life.
---
It looks pretty neat but meh.. More wings.. Can we get some originality for a change?
---
The alternative is that he's actually giving away prizes to actual people. He's been in contact with ANet and they've audited him and deemed that he's ok. The opposition seems to base their assumptions on their belief that no one could possibly come into possession of that many big-ticket items without their knowledge.
---
I bet you all the gold I got at some point in your life you have gone out looking for praise for something you have done or even accepted the praise because according to your own logic, accepting the praise is just as bad as looking for it.
---
I haven't tried it on Windows, but you could also try D9VK. Your NVidia card should have ample support for DX12 and Vulkan. That said D9VK is getting some bigger support from Valve for proton, so you can try that if dx912pxy doesn't work for you.
---
That said, I'm not sure the DXVK/D9VK projects support windows.
---
Yes, old news.
---
I didn't expect this to be the case, so sort of wasted 20g + 5k magic by getting it from the vendor in the first days. If you still haven't got it, don't repeat my mistake and just get it from TP.
---
Idk. The Charr Helmet kinda got me unexpectedly.
---
If it wasn't Gemstore, I wouldn't be surprised to be exclusive, even though it looks more Dredge-y than Charr tech
---
What, you expect us to eat *actual food*? Blasphemous
---
Hot maps gives you key? I did all the maps with at least 12 characters, never got one, so i tought it wasnt in the loot table..
---
It's pretty sad to learn that i was so damn unlucky
---
I don't think it was particularly good or bad. The update did create an opportunity for making a bit of gold.
---
Crafted some stuff to get to 450 then did the collection but whether I craft to 450 or 500 is not much difference.
---
Only time gating I had to deal with was the 2 hour thing. Speaking of which. Why the hell are we crafting cookware using the world's most expensive materials?
---
open world and story for sure. some ppl like to have a challenge and even do group content like dungeons and factals solo. i think only raids are impossible solo even when you are good but not sure.
---
I learned that much I guess
---
If you hate it soo much why even click on the comment if not with the intention of belittling someone for the absolute fun of it. 
---
Of which if that is the case.. you're a pretty sad little person aren't ya.
---
It doesn't even hold true all the time and end up creating a trap for the unwary. There was a time when crafting spiritwood planks was an overall lost versus selling the material.
---
**SOUL KEEPER DRAGON REAPER** will be in my head for months
---
Seems related to the fact it uses actual engine physic instead of simulated rigged clothing like most buttcapes. That would be my guess.
---
Doesn't matter. People will still complain when it happens. Just like they complained about skyscale and Vision requirements.
---
looks better
---
IS THIS BETA VERSION OF, ahem *hide trenchocoat* feature?!
---
I know it's not well optimized. It's still not meling anything on my computer. In fact, GW 2 is the least heat intensive game on my slightly impressive list of games. And that was what you said. So I'm going for that part of the conversation. Not whether the game is optimized or not. 
---
We all know it isn't.
---
Well that would be the assumption most would make but the opposition is strongly implying that ANet is complicit in his RMT and is saying nothing because he makes them money. Which is just a little too tinfoil-hat for me
---
To be honest I don't think I've ever played a game to just stare at it. Even if the game is a visual novel or a game that's all about a journey rather than gameplay, you're still doing something. 
---
And I've played a few point and click adventures, visual novels and adventure games. Funny, though, how most of those games were old school games with outdated graphics... or pixel art. Or anime.
---
Games like Journey, you still have to do shit.... I think the point that I'm trying to make is that you don't just turn a game on and sit and watch it like a movie. Unless it's a Hideo Kojima game....
---
Not gonna lie... the game looks totally fine. Archeage arguably *needed* the graphic update, but GW2 does not.
---
Jokes aside, I've used it since I started playing the game years ago. I've subconsciously used it to identify when an attack of mine lands and when it misses, and also many auto-attack chains have a more pronounced camera shake for the last hit, so I'm able to have a better idea of when my auto-attack chain ends without having to look at my skill bar or character.
---
Yeah that is also my speculation
---
/gg yourself pls
---
That's a good point but for me at least those points aren't enough to counter balance the negatives of using camera shake.
---
It's like intense head bobbing in FPS games. I just don't see how it's immersive, ya know? My head sure doesn't bob when I walk or run.
---
Oh great, more wings...
---
Check snowcrows for raids, discretize for fractals and metabattle for builds and guides in general.
---
Like the game modes were good, but was dominated by one class with cheese tactics. Involving that you had stacked up npcs to fight with you.
---
I have played enough gw1 pvp to know it's not greener on the other side. I do believe it can be done but not in the capacity that Arenanet can do now.
---
Mirage is a lot of fun, especially for over world content. It's not as much as a hot item as chrono but still a very solid specialization worth trying out.
---
I've never had trouble grouping in raids as power herald. It's not, like, meta, but it's really good in pugs and unorganized content due to your buffing(having access to their buffs is why their personal dps is a bit low). Power herald doesn't hit top dps or anything but its dps is consistent and reliable.
---
Yes we do.
---
What the hax... they're trying to sell it to me for 60g off that vendor xD
---
anet wana question..... just dont ask about:balance,pvp,wvw,expansion,elite specs,next legendary weapons,swiss,templates......,BUT YOU CAN ASK ABOUT MUSIC YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEY!!
---
I am part of everyone, i don't. So i can actually make the statement everyone does not.
---
I'd love to hear about your steps to reach to the point where you can talk for everyone. Maybe you meant every attention whore when you said "we", in that case i could believe that.
---
Mesmer isn't a bad class. Mesmer's leveling isn't great until you start unlocking traits, however. Mesmer is more trait reliant than other classes are, so they blossom more as you get to higher levels with them and start learning the different tricks you can do with them.
---
Lmao I swear right? Apparently half the reason (besides clipping issues) that they never added capes to the game was because they wanted more original back items. But now its just WINGS WINGS WINGS, and those dumb poles with a small printer paper sized flag hanging from it like in the new map.
---
The hat actually kind of looks Korean... so my tin foil hat says there's something on the Horizon for the Tyrian version of Korea, which is a Cantha adjacent without bringing in the same issues bringing Cantha back would be but still return us to an Asian aesthetic.  Maybe in Tyrian Korea they have an order of mage knights kind of like orders of paladins in other games?
---
They told me I could become anything I wanted, so I became a jet plane.
---
chilis are almost as easy to farm as winterberries, an aspect none of the s4 currencies shared, not even kralkatite.
---
Hey what helmet armor is that in the picture?
---
other than the hat the entire outfit is copied of existing armors.  no thx.
---
can we just simplify that to "pvp ruins pvp"?
---
Who the heck decided that was a good texture for cloth?
---
Didn't Kralkatite give 25 per heart? On each character doing the hearts? Which is equivalent to multi character berry farm imo.
---
I am not sure why anyone would bother asking that. Just go watch someone else instead.
---
another cash grab that adds nothing to the game, yay
---
I hope they don't nerf it.
---
Assault what? My eyes? :I
---
The lack of quiver skins is really depressing.
---
There is a timer and there is no breakbar btw.
---
Source: i do strike mission every day.
---
You know what also is not there that makes it super enjoyable? Toxic Raiders.
---
Way to go Mc Zii xdd why is dis so gud
---
The less buttcapes, the better!
---
I dunno, in Destiny my teammates don't do anything even when the Drifter is yelling at them to bank their motes.
---
More cowbell!
---
The design is kind of all over the place.
---
I don't know man...
---
I run healbrand and if i don't stab/heal people DIE.
---
what's so easy for you may not be that easy for people that are newer...
---
Liking the new binding
---
In all honesty gw 2 graphics arent bad at all considering its release date. Plus usually this type of graphics improvement are mostly shaders and smaller aspect rather Than an overhaul.
---
While i would love to have even better graphics, i think the characters armor and even the effects still looks awesome.
---
Terrain is also beatifull, but some areas you can see that there are lack of details, but overall looks good.
---
If i had to pick between graphics or story, story would be my pick.
---
sombrero
---
Each character can only earn map completion gifts once.
---
So, if you need more, you need to use multiple characters.
---
Great! I threw up all over my keyboard.
---
Thanks for that.
---
I l8ke most of its skills, but the first one confuses me.
---
WTB that dance emote
---
random or gemstore?
---
Well, I laughed. Not sure how the hell you put up with it, but all the more power to you!
---
Now where have I seen this before.....
---
Oh yeah..
---
https://imgur.com/Uxj7FWt
---
&gt; Get knocked back on Gors 
---
That's on the chrono/fb though.
---
The meta was actually condi for awhile while you were gone.  They even had to nerf basically every condi skill in the game because it was so strong.  So just bad timing that you happened to miss the only condi meta in a long time.
---
&gt; what's so easy for you may not be that easy for people that are newer...
---
Crazy idea here... maybe if the newer players had some kind of hints about what to do from other players or npcs they would be able to avoid the one attack that comes every 5s.
---
LMAO!
---
Now please turn off your camera shake.
---
So, better sell it if I already unlocked it via the trader?
---
I also do it daily, thank you for not understanding my points. Timer is for “bonus chests”. The lack of breakbar is obvious and that’s why I asked for one.  
---
Seems like you downvoted me for this suggestion, guess who is the toxic one.
---
yep, drinking games is society endorsed natural selection
---
Reminds me of that npc at teq that yells out things to watch out for like tendrils and shockwaves etc. Something like that could help players figure out whats going on since most people dont want to take the time to figure it out on their own.
---
Unless you have Torment. With all the condi spam from Awakened it's easy to forget that if you are running away or repositioning you just killed yourself. Cleanse appropriately.
---
My take on this is the structuring of the farm itself through the game. Depending on how good - hence efficient - your map is, the dragonfall meta will take from start to finish between 20 to 35 minutes. Especially the pre event phase is quite troublesome in regards to earning because most of the enemies will drop literally nothing and ppl tend to stick to tags like bubblegum to shoes. So, depends on your analytics, if you are on a map were ppl tend to spam autoattacks and are not able to use spears on the weakpionts after - what finishes them in mere seconds - than your overall gold will be reduced quite significantly. For a more casually approach kourna is better goldwise because you can spam the same events over and over again where everything will reward you at least with something regarding individual or collective skill of your participants.
---
Dragonfall will be higher value the moment you are on a sufficient map with ppl who are able to use special action keys and dish out dmg. So the metaevent will be over sooner plus the leyline bosses will not last for the whole after meta time frame what will give you the opportunity to farm the more "unknown" mistborn note spawns that will only be active after defeating the dragon (usally three to four per "lane"). Also, something I see very often with hot join ppl for the meta, the closing of the map is not the end of a farm. The finished bridge events is.
---
New areas look 999999x better than the core areas. Its a pretty game
---
Exactly why I said I don't care about what they have to say until they talk about those things again
---
Yes, but that's not really burst though, compared to something like a Soulbeast's Whirling Defense though, is it? With the speed of those phases pretty much anything could be considered 'burst' at that point, surely. Considering that it's just three skills for the ren, that definitely would not get that result if the phase was even a few seconds longer...
---
Good to know!
---
Ele is so versatile! You can go staff ele and have tons of range and AoEs, or you can go dagger/dagger or sword/dagger and have crazy damage output and mobility, or you can go x/warhorn and have great sustain. And the fast-paced attunement swapping with Arcane/Weaver is tons of fun!
---
Also, while Staff Fire 4 is so easy to mess up, with practice, it's a great get out of battle free card.
---
I don't know much about engi but holosmith is very shiny and makes my inner skritt very happy.
---
As a mostly only PvP i can hardly laugh at this anymore, since every day it is less of a satire and more a reality.
---
Make PvP great again! I wanna be able to play staff ele again and not be be threatened with reports and nasty mails galore.
---
I don't think there's any other use...

The Immortal Noodle...?
---
No their cash shop is successful. Ours is not. :P
---
YOU'VE GOT ENOUGH TO SUMMON A PRIMEVAL! BANK THOSE MOTES!
---
Huh. The dye channels are actually pretty logical and do what I would expect them to. Not bad. My only complaint is that the top of the hat renders in a lighter color, but that might be the lighting in the preview window.
---
I dunno, wiki has the answer.
---
Yeah, I like Holo, too.
---
Heat Therapy is a hell of a drug.
---
Anytime npc mentions "Commander" in GW2, I get the same feeling when the npc plebs in halo mentions "Master Chief" - like a badass hero.
---
Huh, maybe i will give it another try. I have had mine off since beta since playing staff ele is constant rollercoaster bobbing fury.
---
My commander prefers playing against actual coordinated groups and skips over obviously awful choices, thanks for the suggestion though
---
is it legtimate to use bounty glyph with item booster when harvest its reach nearly 100 % extra gather strike so 12 slots of plots give 24 cultivated seeds so you can craft 12 feast salvage again and replant?
---
Nyyyyyoooommm!
---
The market has spoken
---
It's also 500 for the tank which I have worked towards for the last week.
---
Possible. Doing that I feel should be a minimum if they touch gw1 again, and i hope they do.
---
&gt; That looks like 2 members of the three amigos...
---
The 3rd member didn't hit their dodge key in time.
---
RIP
---
You were losing to a team with a core necro on it?
---
Ok you got a clueless commander. No problem for the suggestion
---
Correct, it doesn't give you a second node and removes the service option from the chili vendors (sent one to my 2nd account which has no Volatile tools atm).
---
Well, there is not much more replayability in the new map than farming those rare skins. So this may keep the map alive more than 1 month.
---
You can dodge that. For a drink raid it is actually a good idea to let all dodge or avoid the attack themself. Brings more fun.
---
My guild does those drinks raids on halloween or other holidays and we even let ppl who dropped an exo determine rules themself.
---
It‘s funny when you always have to sing when you say something.
---
I think we're already past time when this would be in any way surprising. Just expect that going forward every episode or festival release will have its own ultra-rare Unobtainium Infusion. That seems to be their modus operandi for at least a year now. If they're still doing it, it must be that according to their metrics it accomplishes the goal of keeping players ~~farming the content like zombies for months on end, eager to buy into any new microtransaction they shit out in gemstore~~ engaged.
---
Then I suppose I don't really understand. It's a hard concept to wrap my head around. And I am aware that they would have used precasts. (It is done at a level so far beyond my level of play that it seems incomprehensible to me.)
---
i am just asking to be sure better be sure then to regret or have a ban.
---
/r/BoltOns
---
Yeah where are all of those quiver gliders?!
---
Needs bobble head tonic.
---
Ok so I have d912pxy downloaded and it’s a pretty huge performance improvement. However something odd that I’m not sure is supposed to happen or not; on bob Task Manager and NZXT manager which I use to monitor CPU and GPU temp and such, it shows that GW2 is not putting any load on the GPU, however the GPU temp, clock speed, and fan speed all indicate that it IS putting load on the GPU, and I assume that it has to be as I have it set to use the 1060 at all times. I ensured that dx12 is installed properly and all as well
---
You do know that the recommended videos are specifically tailored to your own personal viewing history, and basically no one will have been recommended that same set at the end, right?
---
Maybe we should make a thread suggesting what we'd like to see. They may make them. Simply saying "no more wings" doesn't help them with ideas.
---
While a lot of professions can heal others, some also provide buffs and dps increase to the party.
---
Strong healers can be elementalist, revenants and rangers
---
Eles provide some boons, and constant medium aoe heals, with optional bursts. Also have nice condi clenses.
---
Revenants have lots of utility as well as a lot of extremely strong aoe burst skills. Can provide alacrity.
---
Druids offer nice minor heals with very strong burst healing skills. Also lots of stat boosts and dps boosts.
---
Other professions offer strong dps, or better utility
---
Right?  First thought was "Damn, this reminds of Wing Gundam."
---
I'm very aware of that. If they were the same for everyone, then everyone would have seen the bizarro montage that came up on this computer and there wouldn't have been any reason to post the screenshot. 
---
Not my computer. I'm just killin' time while a drive image on another machine tries to decide if it's going to work or barf.
---
Usually the term "completionist" means someone who tries to get 100 % done in a certain game. Meaning all the achievements ,or all the skins , etc.
---
But I think I see what you mean.
---
I think comparison is relevant in this case.
---
Time-gating is a core part of MMOs and Guild Wars 2 took it in the opposite direction. You're complaining that your racing game has too much racing in it.
---
The majority of time-gates can be bypassed by buying the necessary items from the TP and is a way to maintain the profitability of crafting.
---
But the game is also an RPG. Sometimes it only makes sense if time passes between the events. A good example is waiting for your Skyscale to grow. But it was a definite improvement making it a game day rather than a real-life day.
---
This does not increase my confidence in the game, Anet.
---
What's the issue with extremely rare stuff? I like extremely rare stuff. Even if you never get them it makes the game exciting.
---
Option 1) the devs don't play the game  
---
Option 2) the devs play the game, know the framerate sucks, but it isn't easy to fix  
---
Which one of these is more likely?  
---
2. It's option 2. There is 0% chance they don't play their own game.
---
The heart of Khan-ur should be that thing, the helm should not.
---
Rangers.. where are you?
---
No?
---
Because you want it?
---
Sometimes it's not about wanting it hard enough.
---
Bet you could dye this like Raiden!
---
This is like saying Dungeons are endgame. They used to be but since the release of HoT you can barely count them anymore since the rewards are that bad that most ppl wont bother doing them and the difficulty with the release of elitespecs well is non existent
---
and even if you remain to your point that fractals are endgame you still don't need a healer for fractals and groups that run a healer cause T4 only will most of the time accept Druid Chrono as a comp
---
Druid is the to go healer that was my statement before and unless you can find an argument against that i remain correct in the main topic of this post.
---
Also raids are way more accesible than fractals since ar is a thing which makes gearing Druid a higher priority than even a heal fb if you're bad enough that you even need that
---
Ah there's that disingenuous streak again, as if you can write snarky little remarks without having it thrown back at you.
---
If you had considered certain data from the start, you should have said what it was instead of allowing me to point it out.  But as it is, you did not consider that data from the start.
---
I wrote: "The game throws obsidian shards at you, but doesn't also load you down with the materials to make fulgurite or legendaries; doesn't offer you diverse options to consume them".  Acquisition and consumption rates were a point I made, not you, to talk about how legendaries are not a sink.  I later brought up the bell curve to illustrate where "most people" will fall in the distribution of whatever amounts there are: the data you don't have.  My stance this whole thread has been that you cannot say "most people do not have an abundance" without defining what that abundance amount is.  Then to measure "abundance" against the most expensive recipe for obsidian shards and other mats (a legendary) as a sink is silly at best.  Your argument is the equivalent of saying most people do not have $50MM.  On a bell curve of wealth most people will indeed not have $50MM.  But most people will have some amount that they can spend on other things.  Which other things again is it that obsidian shards can be spent on that do not involve other expensive materials?
---
Just make the vip title part of the collection
---
...anet has been doing the .00001% drop chance on infusions for years, you think they will change simply because "you hope so"????
---
I love druid because I love celestial avatar and glyphs. Condi Druid feels very versatile, even in the open world. I swap around my traits so much but I always feel like I am actively doing something to help others around me. My druid was the first character to successfully solo hold a camp for the first half of Verdant Brink (yay traps)
---
Didn't you hear? This is the new fashion wars 2 meta!
---
Not sure if serious.
---
I'll never understand these home instance nodes. First they were 50g, which was already huge for most players and now it seems they'll be 60g. It must take sooo long to break even
---
"It's a Gundaaaa-" [Explodes]
---
Idk why ppl are downvoting you, you Just  Said the truth
---
Someone might be a heretic?
---
Never mind the boss. 
---
I've have people rage quit because they found the JP before the boss too hard.
---
meta tank for dhuum is renegade if it hasn't changed again  
---
Bosses that actually hurt are mostly tanked by the Chrono since the Chrono can block most hits  
---
the only example i can think of where the Boss hurts and it isn't tanked by a Chrono is Xera which is tanked by the Druid cause you don't run support Chronos there.
---
For pug groups it's almost everytime Chrono or just the Person that has increased toughness for Bosses that are trivial to tank
---
Reminds me of the crystal sage in dark souls.
---
What about no, every time ANet does anything to fractals, they don't get harder, they just getting teaduse and annoying, just look what they did to the UW fractal, and why, cause farming is bad in their eyes. They are so out of the touch with fractals/PvP/WvW communities that they just make the game modes unbearable every time they make so called "life improvements".  To then hard fractal is, take off brake bar completely, reduce your HP as much as possible, and make all your boons obsolete. SO don't bring this disaster on us plies if you truly love fractals, et them stay as they are and just enjoy them like they are, and if u ever get bored T1 nude runs are just the thing for you mate.
---
lol
---
I guess I just thought that society had been long past thinking \m/ as being any bit controversial. Seeing a game company exclude it when every rocker I've ever known has always used them, just doesn't make a lot of sense to me.
---
It's possible anet just totally forgot about it and it never crossed their mind, I don't think they're exactly the same company that made gw1, but I find it hard to believe they just "forgot"
---
And it also doesn't make a lot of sense to me in that the only groups I can see the exclusion of horns in a headbang appeasing are the same types of people that would find the lesbian relationship offensive, aka religious zealots. The only person I ever knew to hate Rock 'n Roll and all other high energy/aggressive music and the things associated with them was my grandmother, who was pretty much just that, a religious zealot.
---
Idk, I guess christian bands are a thing too? I've never listened to them or paid much attention to them, but maybe it's really taboo to headbang with the devil's horns at a christian band's concert or something. Maybe the people in charge of making this animation were of those types of people, which is the only thing that sort of makes sense to me
---
The one I joke about is deadly in groups with many multiclass players. Whenever Player A asks Player B "what do you wanna play for this boss/wing?" and gets a "I'll play whatever" in response, take a shot. Bonus if it's "oh you pick, i'll play the other one" and then it bounces back and forth. Just say "I'll play quickbrand!"
---
Nice to hear that you got an improvement out of it. Unfortunately I am not really an expert about how d912pxy works and why the monitoring tools do not show any gpu usage for you. 
---
All I know is that gw2 is not really heavy on the gpu in general, the cpu is more important for that game. 
---
Apart from that you might want to ask someone else if any problems occur.
---
Wait, male charr can get special horns too? How? Which horns do they pick as female? What do they look like?
---
Quite probably the recipe to change the stats in the infusion.
---
You're right. A week after a major story content release with a new map, strike mission, multiple cosmetic unlocks (some easy to obtain, some long rng grind) and they don't put out another massive patch? Game's dead, bro. gg no ree. Lituraly no point in playing if I can't get big content patches every week, amirite?
---
well, the two LS4 gifts including the 6 map currencies (3 each) for Vision were combined with Elonian Wine, which doesnt show up as possible combination with hatched chilis
---
There is no breaking even, it's just for completion's sake.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gathering#Notes_on_additional_strikes
---
&gt;Some nodes cannot receive additional strikes: All home instance nodes except for those from the Black Lion Garden Plot Deed (which do receive extra strikes)
---
You're fine. Garden plots are the only nodes in your home instance that you can get extra gathering strikes on.
---
now i want to see someone do the "run a parameter around the stage" event doing this
---
GW is unrewarding in general, this is nothing new.
---
They want you to grind or buy gems.
---
Thanks so much for this! That was the one left for me :D
---
It's the only charr-only helmet.  Do it to a cool looking human female helmet and see how many people flip their shit.
---
Most armor fits like crap on a charr, so when we finally get something that looks good, its stupid hard to get.
---
let's just say i do CMs and T4 but hey i can see the lfg anyway and that's why i can savely assure you that ppl will the comps i allready named above many groups are even asking for both chrono/druid and firebrigade so they fill faster.  
---
some of them even run Chrono as alac or Quickness source cause they don't want to wait
---
&gt; you simply need to look at the damn fractal groups in EU and you will see for your self instead of asking for statements... 
---
it seems you are blind
---
anyway fractal healer to go is no healer everything is else is ..... and can be treatet equally
---
Wait... what? How do they want you to do that with adding Chillis to Forge?
---
Yes
---
and strange [fish armor](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/File:Necromancer_Primeval_armor_m.jpg)
---
Typical anet rewards, nothing new.
---
Maybe u/Alexander-Youngblood knows and is at liberty to say, if there actually is an undiscovered Mystic Forge Recipe with Hatched Chilis that could potentially be forged already or if its just a bug/unreleased content.
---
Probably generalize it to "players ruin games," too.
---
They've been banned, but I think I know. ANet has access to a few body types that we don't.
---
I bought it on the second day from the map vendor because at the time it was going for 62g+ in the trading post and I didn't feel like waiting for the price to come down. Gotta keep my home instance at 100%.
---
I so want this cuz I can't farm enough gold in a reasonable  time. I want to see it on Charr.
---
Eh. I did that and then sold two drops I got later.
---
I'm more annoyed that you only get one chili from the node.
---
i wish lmao  
---
but hey, dress for the job you want
---
I’m tired of people shitting on new gemstore items. It’s literally the only way they make money besides expansions. No gemstore = no game at all.
---
Only way to play mesmer is naked.
---
ay thanks, since the pool's not too big chances are pretty good so gl dude
---
I don't really understand why people feel they should be entitled to every skin in the game, its an ultra rare item, having low drop rate items is fine. get over it, its not like its a game changing item, its a skin. grind til you get it or buck up and waste the gold.
---
Necromancer. It's the most forgiving profession to play, reaper even more so. You honestly either have to bite off more than you can chew in a bad way, or intentionally screw up to die on a reaper, they thrive with multiple enemies. 
---
If you get downed? Spam 1 and laugh , especially if you have the trait that does more damage when you're downed. Greatsword is slow, but satisfying to use, each hit feels like it has weight behind it. Reaper shroud? CC, damage reduction, spin to win that can also double as a heal and downed player teleport if you spec the right trait (great for pulling downed players out of bad spots while partially reviving them).
---
Then you have Scourge, aptly named for the amount of conditions it shuts out, not to mention barrier and healing, especially when you hook up the before mentioned trait that lets you heal and revive people. There's a trait that lets you heal for a percentage of your condition damage, which is amazing one you start pumping out a shitload of conditions on the enemy. It took me a long time before I got into scourge, I did the understand it at first, but now it might be my favourite.
---
I really enjoy playing Necro. I don't regret having six of them.
---
No, because it's a lame ass looking helmet skin. 
---
It's baffling how people still defend the abysmal reward structure this game has. Lo and behold the new endgame goal, a fucking 3600 gold(!!!!!!) helmet that looks like a starter skin. Because that makes *total* sense, right?
---
Ask yourself what shelf would anyone in their right mind put that skin on: "crap you craft at armorsmith 125", or "literally Eternity"?
---
And then you look into it and realize the buy orders are just from tp barons looking into boosting their account value.
---
Ah yeah. I will edit the post.  Thanks!
---
Can someone please preview it on a charr?  Pleez.
---
Just bring lots of reflects and pulls for Siren’s Reef last boss. Condi clear is good too. Pay attention to the mechanics and circles and play patiently, and you should be fine.
---
I'm not promising anything but so far all of the news about AA Unchained looks really good. I'm really invested in FFXIV right now, but I am certainly going to be watching the news with AA. It's launching I guess 6 days from now? I kinda wish it would come a few months later because I really do have interest in playing it but I have my hands tied right now lmao.
---
When Iron Legion said they were making gears, this is not what I thought they meant!
---
First of all, level designers are map *artists*, a discipline that requires heavy art knowledge. Second, the entirety of the blood keep, the whole aurene area, the vault, the flying platforms, the effigy, and far more than that are *all* brand new assets. A great portion of this release is all brand new stuff. You're crazy if you think this map is basically all reused assets.
---
*Hears keyboard*
---
Yep, it's step
---
Running around any area of the game that isn't a meta event or a crowded city does not have low framerate. I would definitely call that "occasional".
---
That's just a generic sylvari called Priory Historian. He is, however, one of the side roles for Graham McTavish (who also voices a few other sylvari on the map) whose main role in this release is Bangar Ruinbringer. :)
---
I'm confused by your logic if you don't think I'm serious. People post all sorts of feedback about what anet shouldn't do and expect anet to listen, but posting what they should do is suddenly ridiculous?
---
And because of people like you defending this shit i have nothing prestigious to work for.
---
I can buy everything from the gemmstore but it still won't feel rewarding or special.
---
Getting cool stuff by playing the game is such an alien concept, raid skins look worse than 5 year old black lion collections, and best fractal infusion texture has 3 pixel resolution.
---
And if you see someone with unique rare item, is just a tp Barron, what a great reward system.
---
And just because anet has stumbled in too this situation, doesn't mean it has to keep going, or is healthy for the game.
---
I would happily buy expansions. This junk?  Not so much. 
---
Also have everything I could possibly want at this point so not buying gemstore items anyway. lack of meaningful rewards in game is a real issue
---
There are 37 legendary weapons you can work for if you need a long-term goal.
---
I would believe you but... only 3 have been unlocked on gw2 eff.
---
Opinion ona  design is subjective, just because you dislike the look of, a raid skin for instance, does not mean everyone else does, your opinion is skewed. For instance, I don't find these wings appealing at all, they hold no value to me.
---
I’m sure Anet will make sure none of the future strikes have anything but a flat pathway to the next boss then. Can’t have people not doing strikes due to the jumping puzzle being too hard. Have to appeal to the lowest possible denominator
---
"Mo they subscription fee" lol
---
Hi there. I'm curious about a few builds for the Engineer.  
---
I know that Holosmith is mainly power.  
---
Is there a decent Condition and or Heal/Support build that's good to use in Fractals/PvE?  
---
Engineer is a fun class but power Holo gets boring after a time, and would love a reason to play the other builds.
---
Fractals, expansion meta events, dragonfall meta, etc. Many things are better than others but there are a ton of options for decent gold gain from[ gathering nodes](https://gw2efficiency.com/gathering/permanent-nodes) doing [daily crafts](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a~0!b~1!c~0!d~1-46742), to just doing the [daily achievement](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Daily). I have [some examples here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Gold_Farming) as well as a link to [Peureki.3647's gold farming sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yh487baFzsbJARil-evNdrG3KOmoncEfurElBm0CzdE/edit#gid=1982020967) for a detailed breakdown of many of the main farming spots.
---
Kasmeer, is that you?
---
You fail to understand why chrono is tanking. Chrono tanks because you lose basically nothing. You can still give your boons, which is your main job. You lose a bit of dps, but that doesn't matter that much because it isn't that great to begin with.
---
This is also the reason why mechanics are often dealt with by the other support classes. See dhuum greens, etc. Basically you want to do everything so your dps monkeys can just brainafk their rotation and get big numbers.
---
Thank you so much!
---
OK.  Who in the Anet art department was alpha testing New World?
---
you can play pve casually as literally ANY class/elite spec
---
in fractals, not so much, because condition engineer has some high ramp up times
---
But [this build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/engineer/condition/) is what you're probably looking for
---
A cat with wings, humans are no longer the top predator
---
He is in the "Old Command Post" on the east central side by a bunch of "computers".
---
Because i should play metadps from sc site, i know...
---
GOD FORBID i actually enjoy playing a healer like... OMG!!!
---
good thing i make my own groups and don't have to deal with bs like that...
---
&gt; Heal/Support build that's good to use in Fractals/PvE?
---
So first off, fractals heavily prefer power DPS over condi DPS for the burst damage and speed it provides in killing bosses and adds. The idea is to phase and kill bosses before condi DPS would have a chance to stack up. Some condi builds have high power damage and low ramp up times so they can be decent but in most cases you're much better off with power DPS comps. In fractals you want to take [power holo](https://discretize.eu/builds/engineer/power-holosmith) (or the [raid power version](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/holosmith/power/)) but in raids [condi holo](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/holosmith/condition/) and [condi engi](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/engineer/condition/) both have good builds. The only problem with the condi builds is that they have pretty difficuly rotations to properly pull off for full DPS, take a look at the rotation builds but I still would not recommend them for fractals.
---
Secondly the meta in fractals is to run quickness firebrand and alacrity renegade, both of which are better healers (utility and boons) than heal scrapper. Heal scrapper is really only seen in WvW since it is amazing at converting conditions and has pretty big healing (and WvW utility with stealth). For PvE scrapper brings 0 damage or damage buffs (like Spirits, Spotter, Assassin's Presence, Soul Cleave, personal DPS, etc) and things like heal firebrand bring a lot of utility in might and blocks (aegis) while still giving the quickness you need and heal renegade still gives alacrity and major healing with it's other damage bonuses. So outside of WvW, not really a good reason to ever take [heal scrapper](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/scrapper/heal/) in PvE over better options.
---
of course it has the chance to, just like every other non-city in pve
---
I don't really play Charr, but that's like the perfect Charr backpack.
---
wow..... chill out.
---
Right, thanks for the input and help! Might I ask if you're knowledgeable about Mesmer in that regard? Only thing I know is that they have the Mirage for condi while I'm unsure about support or power specs.
---
Really depends, they answer tickets in the order that they receive them. Even if the same person has two tickets, they have to put that 2nd request on hold til they get to it.
---
A big patch came out not too long ago and there has been a large amount of new players entering the game so they might have a large amount of tickets.
---
It’s can take anywhere from 2 - 5 business days.
---
Mood.
---
[Boon chrono](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/) is meta on nearly every raid (complements a firebrand/renegade comp or dual chrono, isn't taken on boon thief fights). Support chrono has fallen out of favor in fractals (for the aforementioned firebrand/renegade comp) but is still sometimes seen in pugs. There is also a power DPS chrono build you can run in [fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer) and [raids](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power/). [Condi mirage](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/mirage/condition/) is great in raids (top DPS on many specific fights) but like I said before, not wanted in fractals.
---
Are you mainly looking to get into fractals, raids, or both? Were you looking for training?
---
Like a week, think of how many people made accounts back when and they made PoF and HoT purchasable together a lot of people forget their passwords. If you’re patient and provided adequate proof of account ownership,shouldn’t be too long. I lost an item on my account and it took them a week to respond. But after that replies were only a day between.
---
I'm surprised it's come back so many times, the other 2k gem skins sure don't have this rate of return. Too bad I still can't afford it.
---
Is it bugged in the sense that some items will not count towards the achieve?
---
