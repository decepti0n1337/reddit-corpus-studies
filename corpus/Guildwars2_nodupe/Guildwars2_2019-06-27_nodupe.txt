I doubt that. Otherwise we'd get copies of the skills the enemy had and get more data from more varied builds. 
---

---
But we get a fixed set from each profession.
---
At most they may be testing an elite spect for thieves that allows them to do the same and steal fixed sets of skils from each profession.

As a Sylvari who chose the White Stag, I thought for a while that those story quests were where I got that title

Holy crap that is amazing!

Generally, it's usually a good idea to stick to what you know. Take that lesson into the real world, along with the other lessons I've taught you here. It'll help you.
---
Instead of being the "nicest community"...cause you're not.
---
Wow thank you this is really helpful!
---
I didn‚Äôt watch the video, as did probably most people who saw this post. 
---
You may want to do more to market your video to change that. It could be amazing but no one would know because no one found anything in your description that would warrant them taking their time to watch it. All you started was the obvious (it‚Äôs a YouTube video, and we can see that from the link itself).
---
What is it about? What would you want us to know that would pique my interest? People have limited time and most will not bother to click on a video they don‚Äôt even know will be of any interest to them. Is it a guide? A story? A raid clear? A compilation of PvP fights? A video about WvW commanding? A guild RP session? Many people here have narrow interests even within GW2, so you want to publicize a little bit more so you can find your target audience. 
---
Also, this might be a weird mobile thing, but by using the short link, the preview didn‚Äôt even resolve with the title or description on my app like it normally would (no thumbnail). That may be something to keep in mind. 
---
Making a video is hard. Marketing it so that people watch is even harder, especially if people don‚Äôt know your video content and quality. Keep trying. Good luck.

No, sorry, have to disagree there. While public shaming is sure the wrong way to go about it, constructive criticism doesnt have to be delivered after the fact and in private to be helpful. If someone is willing to improve, constructive help will always be appreciated by them.
---
However, a lot of GW2 players arent willing to improve, so everything you try to explain to them - no matter the delivery - is toxic in their eyes. After all, their build and playstyle gets them through 98% of the game with max. rewards, so clearly its the other players gatekeeping them from those remaining 2% by being toxic elitists.
---
I dunno, one vague map half isn't much attention.  S3, pof, and S4 has still been very firmly human.  I'd like seeing a lot more than just a vague acknowledgement that asura exist.  The sylvari already got completely shafted in their own expansion.  I'd really rather not see my other favorites so blithely passed over.

 A simple way to get this cheevo is to just run the instance twice all the way through without leaving.

Meh, I'd call it worldbuilding but okay :l
---
Thank you! It does seem like it is better to sell if I am mostly after the gold. I‚Äôve missed about every holiday event so this is all new to me haha
---
I appreciate your input!
---
Oh, thanks i wondered where this was. I didn't even see the instanced dungeon version of this over there.
---
It's not the same, only because both have pets...
---
Yes there is! There's an asura reveler to the southwest side of the great lodge (he's just to the left of the portal to Lion's Arch IIRC) who wonders if the Commander is a fan of Snargle Goldclaw, among other things. XD
---
Fractals have multiple weapon sets, tonics and infusions instead. Oh, and don't forget the ascended armor chests and trinkets.

It's projectile block, not reflect. And I doubt it's going to be any upkeeps, because they'd have to give you an energy bar for the time being which ain't gonna happen.

If the shoulder piece from the new mist outfit becomes a gem store item like the ears from the fox outfit and the shoulders from Braham‚Äôs new outfit it would be perfect for this.
---
Sinister may be not easy to get for OP, as you cannot buy it off TP, it has to be crafted (and is not exactly cheap to use as temporary solution, for a new player anyway)
---
Some combination of Rampager, Carrion and Viper should work - at least, for open world / story progression, where lack of Expertise (condition duration increase) is not that important, for enemies not living long enough in most cases.

Sword next elite spec pls. Everyone has sword, necro no sword. Feelsaloneman

A liquid cooled 9700K with 2060 is not midrange. Personally, I'd wait for Zen2, but the build seems good so far. Can't say about price, as we are from different locations.
---
Yeap, it totally slipped my mind for some reason hahaha. Thanks for the comment!
---
Its a vid related to pvp. Urm, dont expect excellent quality but i hope it could be interesting for at least some people. :)
---
Depending on the type of content you‚Äôre going to do (open world, fractals, raids, wvw), condi scourge could be a bad idea.
---
If you can tell us what content you‚Äôre interested in, we can give you better advice.
---
Cool, thanks
---
They kind of deserved it, though.
---
So its considered low or high range? Forgive my incompetence.
---
All up its just over 2k Usd.
---
I just ctrl-right click to enable auto attack on each one while I‚Äôm doing inventory mgmt or whatever.  Then it just happens automatically in the background. Obviously this makes more sense on the ones that are 10 each.
---
It's not absolutely top end, but it's in the higher range.
---
Awesome thanks.
---
If you only read my whole post or at least after the comma. The best for changing the skins in a leveling toon. Because it is free and it looks way better than the mithrilium and iron variants of every weapon that you get.
---
Let me repeat it. The best for transmuting the skin from a meh-looking skin to a bit-better-than-meh (with some shiny effect looking) skin. With the other main advantage is that you can swap to this skin anytime because it's for free.
---
Besides, you really thought this set is a better design than some exotics or legys. I won't even mention BLC skins, that some can even look better than legys. They just all cost 1TC, and using each time you swap weapons may coma and bite you later.
---
There are 2 weapons sets and 2 armor sets you can get from Achievment Points. Zenith and Pinnacle are weapon sets. Radiant and Hellfire are armor sets. And you get them by accumulating achievment points.
---
That is one reason player celebrate reaching 30k AP and not some other random value, because at that lvl you you get at least one complete armor set and one complete weapons set. Thus now 30kAP is a benchmark for dedication to game, but never a indicator of skill (like some used it for in the past).
---
250g is like $15 via gem exchange. Just saying if you don't wanna farm for 10 hours

I see what you did there. Gratz.

Confusion still gets applied from unsuspected sources (e.g. ethereal combo fields from the chrono in addition to projectile finishers or whirl finishers). The best thing to do is to simply keep Xera out of the Bloodstone Shard AoEs.
---
And CC is very much partly the druid's responsibility.
---
Throw in some Touch Ranger utility skills and that sounds like a plan.
---
Yeah, once you hit 80 you wold probably need to gear up before going into the ~~murder jungle~~ Heart of Thorns. You can do this through doing things like dungeons or crafting. There's also fractals for you to do, as well as the dragon bash festival happening at the moment. 
---
You can also learn to farm gold and maybe purchase the living story season 2 from the gemstore - it's the story that leads up to heart of thorns.
---
There‚Äôs a flax farm near the bottom level of the jungle under the Itzel waypoint. Flax sells for quite a decent amount (it‚Äôs used to craft Viper‚Äôs gear).
---
For bladed armor, you‚Äôre generally best buying them with airship parts, You can use alts to open all the airship cargo around the map - a quick 20min run around the map should net you several hundred airship parts. As for the chestpiece, you‚Äôll want to get to T4 during the nighttime meta.
---
Thanks
---
I was playing Overwatch yesterday and somebody on the other team called our Doomfist toxic. We asked what he did and got no response. He was equally confused. I understand that a good Doomfist can be annoying to deal with, but the dude was just playing the game and got called toxic for it.
---
Psychology wise, using the word ‚Äúyou‚Äù in a negative statement will trigger the defensive reaction regardless of its validity. 
---
I would‚Äôve said it this way: ‚ÄúHmm I notice _our_ tanking is not very effective, perhaps _we_ should try doing so and so.‚Äù Use inclusive terms, not terms that would single a player out and end up triggering them.

That should be plenty to run GW2, if that's your primary use case. A bit on the expensive end at NZD 3217.46 (USD 2150.13) but a lot of that could come down to the gamery component choices. You could swap them out to save some money if you wanted. RGB is pricey haha. I'd say that's high-mid tier or low-high tier.

Witchunter seems like it belongs with a medium-armor class.  Could probably fit any of the 3 depending on the flavor you want, though I'd lean towards thief.

But.... It's a MMO,not a single player...
---
it's the only way.
---
You've never ever played WoW, LoL, most-any dedicated PvP game like CoD...
---
Sooo, you're one of those people... You seem way more toxic than anything I saw in pvp and raids until now lmao.
---
&gt;Why sugarcoat it?
---
If you damage someone‚Äôs pride they will be less cooperative. 
---
&gt; Everyone already sees you going down over and over again
---
They already fear getting kicked especially in a pugging scenario. No one will openly admit to not knowing mechanic or being bad at mechanics. Even an unstable connection (through no fault of the player) can risk kicks. Couple that with wounded pride, it doesn‚Äôt feel good to be vulnerable and admit weaknesses. 
---
The only way your method will work is in a tight knit and forgiving guild where trust has been established.
---
Once you get to lvl 80 and start thinking of making a solid build, go for a dps build first. Even if you like support more. This is because a lot of your time will be spent doing open world, story and living world content, which is a lot easier and faster as dps.
---
I made a heal druid first, and it became so boring I quit for 2 years.
---
Since when did having more AP make you better at the game?
---
Would make me do fractals daily again. At the moment I'm only doing them when one of CMs is in rotation.
---
Necro with a shield so I can sit back and hide while I control my giant demon monstrosity (with a breakbar) and sacrifice my own health to buff my minion. Screw the tiny minions we have now.  I want a huge beast that can be controlled with lifeforce and sacrifice skills to order it around and kill everything in my path.

for me it was these:

* daily login rewards won't restart the cycle if you miss a day, it just continues where you left

* making your own build when you know nothing about the game is pointless, get one from metabattle (more budget friendly open world builds)
---
* just google or /wiki anything you get stuck on (mainly world exploration without mounts)
---
Congrats OP, you can join the like 20 people in the world who have as much lol

#Friendly reminder: It takes WAY less time, effort, and resources to get SEVERAL FULL SETS of LEGENDARY armor and weapons, than it does to get even a SINGLE set of Hellfire/Radiant SKINS! :D

It's more about expectations. I didn't get to choose the wording on the survey or anything, I am simply doing what my professor asked me to. There's a lot about this I disagree with -- it's an extremely biased survey because he's trying to prove his own claim, but I'm really just trying to pass the class.
---
I didn't get to write the survey. My professor he did. I'm just trying to do a homework assignment and don't have friends that play GW2, wasn't sure where else to go.
---
or they can go the staff route and make it a melee rifle!
---
My professor wrote the survey and is, I think, not as familiar with the games as he thinks he is. I actually fundamentally reject the notion that all players of a given game are a monolith -- I would imagine that someone who primarily plays GW2 for the cosmetics/fashion aspect of the game would fill this out differently than someone that exclusively plays sPvP. 
---
That being said, he explained this to us as a way to stop people from picking 1 and 5 unless they really, really mean it. There was never a concrete definition for any of it, it was just a honey-nut feelios response. 
---
I am glad that the comments on this post have reflected a lot of the concerns I expressed as well, but I guess that's why this is preliminary unofficial research on his part.

In terms of other festivals the ones in the normal Dragon Bash festival category don't usually reset as far as I recall.  Any progress made will carry over.

In the Feats category, the annual stuff will reset.  The ones that repeat to 25 AP are still capped at 25.
---
But you look at a part of him :o

&gt; these could be possibility opened with break-even in mind

aka, its a huge gamble and the house always wins.
---
I'm sure the timer was over when i still a meter away from 19th one but because it's my 20th try the system pity me and count my 19th pinata haha
---
My professor seems pretty adamant on the quantity side of things -- I think there's a lot of things that need to be changed for this to be quality data collection. To be fair, this really started when I made the mistake of throwing this up in one of my WoW guilds to easily get WoW responses since the rest of my class (we're all getting participants) had a lot of FPS players, so it became pretty lopsided, but then you beautiful GW2 folks rallied hard and now I am very GW2 lopsided.

I'll likely unfortunately just have to normalize my data into equal sizes (which I know is yucky in terms of statistical integrity) but at least I have enough data now without having to just randomly run up to people on the street and hope they play GW2.

Not a fan of people that do 1 vs 1 duels in WvW, especially when it‚Äôs a friendly duel where no one dies.  It‚Äôs surprisingly common and literally the wrong game mode for this.
---
They share extremely similar themes and playstyles. It's so obvious to anyone who's played both WoW and GW2 that there's really no argument to be had about it. Ranger is GW2's Hunter.

IIRC they dropped the number of yaks you need to kill. So although it‚Äôs still an impressive feat, it‚Äôs much easier to get than before.
---
Ah man dumbledore dies!? I just bought the series.. /:
---
you get it only if you've bought the game or expansions, if you're still f2p you won't see it or get them. rewards cycle is 28 days and then it restarts, you can see it by pressing H then achievements and it's on the right.
---
even as a bad player dungeons are level 30 content, if you take a level 80 into content thats been flattened by 2 expansions of powercreep you'll be fine - just actually try something.
---
power warrior is pretty straight forward, you can kill everything with dual wield axes, on 2nd weapon set maybe mace and shield for breakbars and defence until you're more confident and then you can run double mace as 2nd set
---
Yea I'm a tad salty I forgot about the fact each one counted 9 times...
---
It will probably have the same contents, just resets each week. That is how super adventure box worked, if I recall...
---
Nice.
---
Just for a better idea you can see [past sales listed here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Expansion_Sales). I would expect them to do another 50% off sale some time soon but no idea exactly when it could be a week or a month (or even longer no real way to tell but within a month is likely given past sales). When PoF goes on sale you can get the bundle of both expansions for $25 so it's a pretty great deal. There are also living story seasons that take place between the expansions that add story and for season 3/4 new zones. You can see the [order and my take on them here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Story). 
---
I'd say just wait till a sale, there is a lot to do for a fresh level 80 including gearing up, dungeons, fractals, open world, current events, festivals, etc. Feel free to ask me questions about [the guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide) as well if you have any.
---
Turns out you were the Dragon after all
---
they certainly haven't done a great job balancing without dual classing, so i'm with you - make it worse but more fun! wooooo!
---
No Dragonfall Kralk?
---
At least not as underwhelming as dungeon rewards
---
I can highly recommend using Daredevil for that, as you can actually Shadowstep to the platforms of the air elementals, and it so happens to be that the boss gives you the Shadowstep stolen skill as well. You'll never have to use the updraft to get to it if you happen to not have your special action skill up, which saves alot of risk in dying halfway a jump if the adds focus fire you.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if they kept it as something to add to next year's festival.
---
Felt like posting this to show that a 28 is possible solo (without using any portal shenanigans) and because I use the action camera for this adventure which kinda shows a different way of tackling this adventure. For the record I can't do this Adventure as efficient with ground targeting, but the action camera works fairly well for this adventure.  ;-)
---
Yup exactly they build it for you for that $109, i was more just using there website as a compatibility checker and shopping list cuz you might be able to save a bit by buying each item at other places. Then I was just gonna find someone who knows what they are doing to help put it together lol. Tbh 109 isn‚Äôt to bad to get it done by professionals .
---
Just a question for you OP but why are you using the pronoun "they" if you're talking about a single person? It just confused me and I thought you were talking about 2+ ppl.

Anyway if he was alone doing shit in your party, you could have kick him without risking to be kicked by him.

Also who tf ever uses those shit skills in wvw anyway? Thieves guild? Wtf....
---
Create a new character, unbind your mount keys, and level / play the story with her, let her experience the game by herself while "guiding" her subtlety (By walking to the next "objective", don't "drag" her through the game).
---
After reaching 80 help her to equip her character correctly, then show her dungeons, world bosses, Fractals, WvW, etc, basically try to find sth that she likes (To "hook her up" with the game, there's no reason to play if you don't have a goal or content that you enjoy, no matter the circumstances, aka no matter if it's with you or without you).
---
It is omly a loot cap, and i never entcounterd it in the Arena. Beside that u can ez farm up to 12 Boxes per Race intervall with the rollerbettle or farm pvp/wvw loot tracks.

and they will continue to drop. Similar behaviour with other festival weapons like halloween.

Advice for next time: Post it as a direct link to the video. When you do it that way, the thumbnail shows and the thread will directly link to the video itself.

In the current form reaching your video requires a click on the thread + a click on the link. Unfortunately most people will likely only do the first step.

Seeing this... I want this ! Great art. So many promises yet it will probably never come with is a shame.
---
Don't know how anet categorizes the rarity tiers but definitely they don't have a fixed rule for every tier. Even among the same tier there are items with much more probability to drop than others. And i'm not talking exclusively of dragon coffers. These tiers references have to be considered very carefully.

I can't find a HoT + PoF bundle, so that might not be available.

But that's a great way for post-natal abortion...

You dont get it. The skills they named so far are so troll most specs dont even want them.
---
Yeah balance in a pvp based gamemode. What's strange about that?
---
I have everything else the sprockets can give because I've been playing since early access so they've just been sitting there and when the taffy was at 2s20c a sprocket (400 zhaitaffy) came out to be 8g per sprocket where the other items with higher value came out to be less gold per sprocket
---
teapot got to 85 last night, so it seems damage/health scale for quite a while, unlike the rewards.
---
Gw2 is a safespace simulator.
---
They did. It's only 2.5k now compated to 10? before.
---
So now Ultimate Dominator will most likely take you the longest to do. Like it should be for the Ultimate Title.
---
I bought them in a key shop for 11‚Ç¨ and 14‚Ç¨ two weeks ago without any discount.
---
I think it is still over priced.
---
Wvw and pvp are in a terrible state. The community believes pretending everything is amazing makes them superior.
---
Bind dodge to an easily accessible key. Mouse 3 or something.
---
Imagine they spent months nerfing scourge particularly aoe boon corrupt on shades... then magically they rework ONE skill and add 3 aoe corrupt to it. The first weeks without any LOS, animation and unblockable too.
---
Youd think someone there would go hey, this has been problematic with scourges for the last half year. Maybe this gimmick new spell isnt a good idea. Jk rather be incompetent and pretend reworking a single skill / trait regardless of impact means doing your job.
---
Frankly whoever allowed devouring darkness to release in balance / systems team isnt capable of doing the job they have. That simple.
---
And freaking spears for on land, not water only. For warrior please, thanks

Hello. The pve in the middle of the map lagged out the entire map if more than 50 players were playing on it. So badly that the pve couldn't be completed if people actually tried to fight eachother for it.
---
Every 2 hours, for months, all of wvw had desync and insane lag during prime. The map also released while being able to fall through the floor, skip many gated and walls and the map layout is significantly worse than alpine.
---
It also released alongside rev. Rev hammer skills dont work with elevation. So rev was very op on flat maps and unable to do their job due to tiny hills that are everywhere on desert.
---
Between start of HOT and linking servers a HUGE portion of wvw players and guilds left the game. 9 to 5 tiers in EU, and those lower tiers are still dead nowadays.
---
Desert was released in an awful state and was in MANY ways strictly worse than alpine. Especially on release the lag every 2 hours made the map unplayable. It's not reeee wvwers, it's a genuine issue that took months to get fixed cause pve trash was upset about dying and not getting 10 times more rewards than everyone else.
---
Do horses even exist in tyria?
---
Some points against that:
---
* You need a stack of each sw4 material for mount
---
* Bloodstone can reset stats
---
* bitterfrost is still very easy and fully soloable, no need to wait for events
---
I didnt do enough dragonfall yet, if the acquisition of materials there is faster than bitterfrost that's totally awesome but my first point still stands. Proof of point is how active bitterfrost and bloodstone fen is while ember bay is being pretty deserted (due to dragonfall amulet source i guess).
---
They're just a skritt myth
---
Ehat is this mythical beast you call a "horse"? Some kind of phantasmagoria?
---
We have a Raptor, a giant bunny, a manta ray, a Griffon, a dragon etc... and all you are looking for is a damn horse ? lmao
---
Guess I'm glad I waited with buying the Warstaff and Greatblade, but oh does the other sting T_T
---
Caps are fine. Since most players can't control themslves the game is doing it to try to maintain balance. Without them everyone would do X event and nothing else in the game.
---
If anything the quantity of items per event needs to be increased. The amount of taffy/coffers is so low compared to other festivals(Halloween/Wintersday). Taffy, a festival currency, being at 2s is a complete failure from Anet.
---
I'm sorry that you have to settle for the ground up souls of torment demons bound by runes and stone into the form of a teleporting five eyed jackal. A horse would be way edgier, but sometimes you gotta make do with what you have.
---
nodes were 50 laurels + some golds, I sold yesterday 2 jorbreakers for 18g each, so 10 of them would be 180g, almost twice as much as the most expensive node right now (obviously treasure chest aside)

Only to the curent weapon, but don't worry, you will be swimming in transmute charges soon enough. For starters they are part of the daily login reward system.

The one that goes "Kill all the dragons? Surely, you...can't be...serious" is JUST great with how the voice changes within one line. Good job!!

I haven't noticed much bugs. Idles players, trolls, match manipulators and bots... bots everywhere have been catching my eye.  
---
45 minutes further and i'm still greeted with this damn window tho. Guess that's my que to go do something else. LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE!
---
Are centaurs half horse half human in Tyria? Maybe the war began cuz  humans wiped horses out of existence.
---
The risk of buying in a key shop is that if those codes were bought with a stolen credit card, your account will be permanently banned. It's happened before. We've seen quite a few posts on it. If you think that risk is worth it, that's on you, but it's absolutely not worth it to me.

Depends a lot on the class and build, maybe check some of the faster paced more complex rotations like [weaver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJ2fBcr2EmA) or [condition holosmith](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7eS45BAE9S0) that run through lots of skills very quickly and compare that to very simple rotations like [daredevil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5af0R1ae7E) that can pretty much just spam one skill. As you unlock more skills, abilities, comboes, etc you'll feel the game pick up a lot and as you get into harder content where you need to be actively dodging or avoiding big hits things get more complex. If you want you can always jump into sPvP and get a feel for what it's like at max level right away and vs harder opponents than the trash mobs you'll be fighting at low levels.
---
The friendliness comes from an environment designed to align everyone's interests. Not needing to socialise or interact is only a small aspect of this.
---
Frankly I dont consider this "friendly". Its just a way to avoid negatives rather than dealing with issues in a good way. Gw2s niche is creating safespace.
---
If she isn‚Äôt enjoying it buy her the expansions/ an 80 boost 
---
Unlock raptor then go play hot 
---
Pre hot story is kinda trash and even lw s2 is only worth it for the mastery points
---
If she is interested in the story but does not wanna play through woodwn potatoes has story recaps on YouTube I think
---
I've been hoping that's their next elite spec weapon since before Mirage, they have like a ton of off-hand weapons but only two main-hand weapons, the only ranged one being 100% condition-based.
---
Hello. Arah, HoT all had to be nerfed due to reeeeing bad players. Teq was actually a challenge when it released.
---
A part of the playerbase demands all content to be trivial no matter what they do.
---
If they want the ability to play whatever they should ask for improved balance. Instead these players are the opponents of balance under the guise of "it cant exist".
---
If a bad tank gets triggered because I say his tanking is not good then he should play single player games.
---
A bit too much, especially in pve.
---
LS4 maps. Do the meta events for volatile magic and buy trophy shipments with them. Keep what you need and sell what you don't. When you get enough surplus gold, you can just buy the rest off the trading post.
---
I did this and came out with more money than when I started. Farming VM for trophy shipments to sell is a reliable gold farming strategy, so it's fairly efficient and you're saving 15% in the trading post fees each time.
---
Mention it? Ugh raids. Kick them for some innocent mistakes?!?!? RAIDERS ARE SUCH TOXIC ELITISTS REEW
---
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE.
---
Aww! There's so many interesting dialogues.  
---
Our Asura fan is MVP
---
And quite a lot talk abot Dragons and moral discussions of their existence.  
---
And lady norn arguing with Svanir that she hear Jormag too. Interesting.
---
It was 250k kills before.
---
Nah I think the people there would highly agree lmao
---
Just take my upvote. Incredible.
---
Who thought 250k Dollies was an achievable amount?
---
How's that working out for you so far?
---
Until you accept that not everyone appreciate being called out like you do, then you'll continue bashing your head against a brick wall. That will be your reality. 
---
Frankly, I much prefer getting results over "being right".
---
Did you make sure to set the game to windowed full screen before installing?
---
I want to say this has been a common problem for a while in PvP. People usually post on the [gw2 forums](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/9645/report-stuck-in-queue/p13) where they unstuck folks.
---
I am assuming it's related to [this](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/78926/recent-pvp-queuing-instability)
---
I needed them to make Bolt, and I think trophies are one of the few exceptions to the "it's cheaper to farm the gold" rule... as people farm trophy shipments to *make* gold. 
---
They're trivially easy to get if you play LS4 content a lot and the lower tier ones sell for a reasonable amount, so you make gold while you're doing it.
---
Yes, the helmet can be dyed.
---
Because of the centaur war. Someone riding a horse could easily be mistaken for a centaur and end up with an arrow in their chest.
---
Lore-wise I think the entire Jungle was Mordremoth, more than just the danger-noodle in dragons stand? He was a very pervasive enemy, able to send tendrils all over tyria.
---
Still use that but it would be nicer to use a feature they've already shown to have developed that works just fine.
---
This is truly awful survey design - I realise it wasnt you that wrote it, but I'm not sure how much you'll be able to get out of it.
---
At first, I was enjoyed thinking we could buy the sprocket with zhaitaffy, to access all LW S1 items like spinal blades.  
---
But it's the opposite...
---
Ohh... Why didn't you say like that from beginning. Only thing I like more than biased surveys is to answered in the anti-biased way. No more words needed. I am getting to work.
---
I am pretty sure that one human at 9:00 is hating on the Charr and on the peace treaty, he sounds like a separatist. Interesting choice to add that to the ambient dialogue. S5 hint, maybe? *dons tinfoil*
---
My name is Aelyl Glasdou in game :)
---
I don't see how they will struggle more with condi since most condi shitting comes from elite specs. There are ofc still condis and they are more powerful then they were in the past but still compared to elite specs it is nothing. 
---
Was watching a old gvg video a few days ago and became very nostalgic watching their bars were there was a few condi here and there but nothing enough to break a fight with it and fights actaully lasting way longer then they do now. That is when i was thinking why can they not make a week with only core specs.
---
Well yeah, Bitterfrost is still the best map period but you can't get the second earring from Bitterfrost. You *can* get it from Sandswept.
---
Made to fullscreen: this time it didn't crashed, but there is a massive fps drop: better without.
---
My regret is that i did not get in to the combat system and the depth of it until about a year in to the game. I mean sure i did the combat as it should, but doing and understanding is two different things. The synergy in the combat system is amazing if you really know how far you can push it. I wish i did that earlier.
---
Yep I'm locked out of queing too.
---
Horses are know to Tyrians, but they are rather rare. As of now, there are NO horses in GW2 yet, however, GW1 at least had undead/ghostly horses and undead horse riders. However, the model for the "Celestial Horse" for the Lunar New Year festival in GW1 was a canthat Kirin, which is kind of an amphibious horse creature. 
---
By now, the absence of horses in the game is more like a running gag, which is why I personally think we will never see them ingame.
---
Thanks for such a detailed response! It sounds like you've been through the exact same situation, some really good advice so thanks. 
---
I tried to get my girlfriend to play ranger but unfortunately she insisted on playing light armor because "pretty clothes". She didn't want the Necromancer and i made the decision that Ele might be a little too tricky for a new player. So Mesmer she is. But i've set her up with the greatsword so that she can play from range with the idea of me coming along on a tanky build like Firebrand to take all the damage :D 
---
I think you're definitely right that i should take a step back and let her find her own way. She did seem to be a little bit put off by my constant instructions yesterday.
---
Then they'll make it Mallyx.
---
I havne't seen anyone using Mallyx since 2017.
---
I want to forget the game
---
Why not go for 4242?
---
&gt; part of enjoying the game is hating it and getting frustrated by it.
---
These days, most players quit at the slightest level of frustration. This is why games are dumbed down constantly, barriers removed and pacing increased.
---
They had a lot of super long term achievements in WvW iirc, I think the intent was "something to work on"
---
You seem disproportionately and irrationally you upset. A break might be a good idea for you anyway if you're letting a game after you this much.
---
There was a sale on their NA website yesterday I asked a friend in Canada to buy it for me then I paid her, that worked! (First I tried to buy it with a VPN but that didn't work xD) and once I got the code I could select EU servers to play on.
---
The downside is having to find someone willing to buy it for you
---
Im stating without moving back to core gear, there would be more condi in the meta than currently. Keep in mind condi literally doesnt exist in the meta due to scrapper and fb.
---
Its not pop most condi and cc at all. It might be spammy in terms of boon corruption but overall stab is very prevalent and condies arent.
---
The Emperor approves
---
I appreciate the feedback. I lost that battle with my professor but maybe the amount of feedback I got from people that took the survey to this effect will help me win it in the future.
---
I like volunteer, shame I wasnt around back in those days. Think it's quite fitting for most of the community, players of gods, dragons and all sorts of beasts. Yet will take the time to explain how to dodge and help set up newcomers.
---
*The Demonslayer is equipped with a sword and a pistol as well as a set of auxiliary tools to relentlessly pursue his underworldly prey. In times of need, he can activate his "Hunter's Instinct" to be heighten his Marksmanship abilities as well as his ability to unharmedly endure otherwise lethal attacks (pulses fury and aegis)*
---
If you are expecting logic and consistency,  then you're playing the wrong game
---
Im still more inclined on a Vampire or Demonic Based Minion Master elite spec.
---
Demonic pact and shroud would be so cool and summoning  new types of minions would be amazing.
---
For the Vampiric one though itd be a bit different , more like Applying effects to friends/allies that give YOU benefits, making them your thralls., Very stealthy too with invisibility and life drain  like Your allies get  HP for damage they do but YOU also get a % of that life they get things like that. and have his weapon be a main hand sword
---
The rarity isnt based on skin, its based on  stats what you are suggesting is a skin based rarity level and stuf dont work that way lol.
---
Basically Crafted max weapons are same rarity as any other " Rare" skin ones because they have same stats.
---
Adding a tier list based on rarity of skin is a bit unnecessary and overly complicated for no real reason or value
---
Is this possibly a test of the reaction to cross-profession specialization in future content?
---
If a mount like a Springer can be used, get up there next to it or get to a place with a better view of it than below.  (I did it before mounts so dont know if they are locked out during this.)
---
Otherwise, get lucky.  A few were a pain to get.
---
Anet please just do it plz plz plz
---
It can also drop from Dragonfall I believe
---
Until recently was rocking double Mistcleavers. Would sell my limbs for an Astralaria
---
&gt; I am pretty sure that one human at 9:00 is hating on the Charr and on the peace treaty,
---
Uhm, I took that as trying to coexist with dragons/dragon minions/dragon followers.
---
Why not 78 or 87?
---
I know, I'm just intrigued on why would anyone try to manufacture a fake using fanworks widely available across the net.
---
You gonna get caught quick, so what's the point?
---
AP.
---
that the dailies not a chore on my alt accounts
---
The light shoulders are really nice.
---
Not a fan of the loincloths, too similar to ascended.
---
If I need precision movement in a JP, I hold down both left/right mouse buttons. Much less prone to accidents that way.
---
thanks for your feedback,im gonna pray that i get a guild wars 2 code or my depression filled life gets slightly less depression filled XD
---
thats the problem in my country its way too expensive to gert chargable cards and im not exactly rich our monthly income is about 700 us dollars....yeah
---
thanks ALOT for your feedback but like i said,i cant afford any chargable cards etc...my monthly income is 700 dollars,and thats for 5 people
---
Be real, you can't get the ascended piece that you need from scratch within 20minutes.. dude no, I obviously play already very much and I enjoy it too! but I have many characters and ascended loot often fails me. I just mainly do WvW which could definitely use the bonus stats, sure it is not much but it is something worth having. Same goes for raids, there it could also be a nice extra to have but idc that much about raids tbh
---
If they were called the four jackalmen I'd be happy with a jackal mount but since they are the four horsemen 
---
I want a horse
---
The moa isnt's stacking infusions.  
---
It's players riding them.  
---
They used mount tethering to let players 'spectate'.  
---
Players lose their model and build when they are riding the moas, but they keep effects not tied to skins like those from infusions and some consumbles and toys. You can try the friendship tonic if you have it.
---
Nice, mine's 2000
---
can confirm, very nice!
---
nope, it would take too long to explain but due to money problems and ebt i cant even use that,i am just praying that i get a code or so.ething good happens
---
Well In looking for either a Skeletal horse or ghost/ghastly horse
---
I'm looking for a horse because it's the 4 horsemen not the 4 griffonmen or bunnymen or dragonmen doesn't have quite the same ring to it as a horsemen of the Apocalypse
---
Nothing, I don't care about farming currencies in order to get other currencies
---
Yeah I always wondered why it asked before.. was such a pointless pop up.
---
You'd be surprised that even level 200s don't know what a breakbar is
---
The beetle race is probably the first actually good beetle race we've gotten. It's certainly better than that Halloween travesty.
---
Got the saber ages ago for 150 gold. At least I can pick up the other for dirt cheap.
---
*Rules for thee, but not for me.*
---
It's a known bug. ANet has a "quick fix" but haven't found a permanent solution.  
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/78926/recent-pvp-queuing-instability
---
For Eye survived... Power Reapers with Spectral Grasp and GS5 are a pretty solid choice. You'll be pulling in tonnes of adds and cleaving them down for the buff. Nothing Can Save You for boon-conversion on Eye too... though your Mesmer should have no trouble stripping.
---
You can't expect him to know what you're talking about. I'm fairly certain he (consciously assuming "he" here, demographically) doesn't even play the game. He's just a troll here to stir up the community.
---
I enjoyed doing Eye Survived. Bunch of random people that banded together, adapted their builds and went to conquer the challenge. Had a pinch of an old-school dungeon crawler.
---
Shared it on some Discords, hopefully you will find someone that can help :)
---
Precisely. Wait another week or two when there's been a lot more coffers opened, and the prices stabilized. Any time there's a "surprise mechanic" box like this, the market corrects the prices such that you're paying a premium to gamble. I.e. the cost of boxes you will have to open to get an infusion will be higher than the infusion cost itself.
---
Yeah, having a faction against Aurene seems pretty logical to me.  Only a small group of people witnessed her growth; to the majority of the world, this huge dragon just suddenly shows up in the sky, with a new cult worshipping her (the Order of the Crystal Bloom) and the only context the common citizen has is Logan and our character's assurance that, "No, trust us, *this* dragon is good".  I can totally understand a good number of people being pretty uncomfortable with that.
---
Nice. If you now could only apply multiple and select an active one out of those ...
---
&gt; it is entirely impossible for me to come within several thousand of this guy‚Äôs AP.
---
I'm not even sure if that's true. How many AP are locked away in old historical festivals that can't be accessed now?
---
For some reason it only just clicked with me that we've killed 3 whole Elder Dragons. That seems insane in the game's context!
---
Take things slower. There is a ton of content in the original zones. Experience it and enjoy it for what it is because now that I've killed a god and three elder dragons going to help back to experience content for the first time of NPCs and their local problems is annoying rather than interesting.
---
It isn't an ambient dialogue but you guys should really go talk to Nora Cedarhelm near the Moa Race, you can hear her asking everyone to come see some armor she made and she has especial dialogue if you are a Sylvari.
---
Same.  
---
And true for most games, tbh. Idk if it's because I'm french canadian and I guess most of the time they translate with france french but I always find it super cringey...
---
Cool video
---
Yeah, it'd be nice if there was more.  There's like, one Svanir hanging out by the effigies, and if you talk to him, he says something like, "Burn your useless effigies if you like.  Jormag is too powerful for such weak flames!" but that's the only acknowledgment of the festival I saw from them.
---
Well, in Tyria they are definitely not called horsemen.
---
I'm glad there is a festival in Hoelbrak but I hate that it's Dragonbash. The whole thing feels so wrong. From the Canthan dragon fireworks launchers, to the fact that this is an event about defeating Elder Dragons - something the original story of GW2 puts primary emphasis on being the accomplishment of ALL the races, not Tyrians.
---
Dragon Bash should never have been in a racial city - of all the events, it's the most multi-racial event, in fact multi-racial should be the most important part of the event - defeating Elder Dragons required everyone, not the norn.
---
I know the norn care about legends and great heroic feats, but Dragon Bash is about more than just bashing dragons - it's about everyone working together to do it. That aspect of the festival is lost when it's placed in Hoelbrak.
---
It's so jarring walking around and seeing norn culture so clearly defined by a city as incredible as Hoelbrak and seeing that cutlure so poorly represented by the decorations of Dragon Bash.
---
I really wish Hoelbrak had gotten its own festival, like the Great Hunt (which is an annual event in their culture already). They could have incorporated Elder Dragon themes very easily into that (what greater hunt is there than an Elder Dragon).
---
Canthan fireworks launchers and asuran holo-tech in Hoelbrak is a terrible norn festival.
---
&gt; Frankly, I much prefer getting results over "being right".
---
I completely agree, but sometimes you ought to fix the source of the problem, instead of mitigating the damage every time it comes back.
---
Would you deal with the bullshit of the same negative customer again and again and again? There's red lines, and sometimes what looks like a bad short term strategy might prove to be great in the long run.
---
In this case, if your raid can't handle basic criticism, changes are high they will disband sooner or later, and you'll just waste hours of your time for nothing.
---
You want results, you might have more luck just quitting that group instead of trying to fix what cannot be fixed in any reasonable amount of time. Empathy and babysitting are two different things.
---
Alright. Because semantics, apparently. Make do with what you got, anet won't mail you a unique horse skin only because you ask so nicely
---
Whenever we add ambient scenes to the open world (or in this case, a festival in a city) we have to balance how much of the current story is reflected in dialogue vs. scenes that are "evergreen" and work regardless of where you are in your story. So yeah, we sometimes omit certain topics or themes in those scenes to prevent spoiling the experience for folks who haven't progressed as far in their story journey.
---
Core thief and core guard are very good but other than that yes.
---
&gt; Something that would have liked to know when you started
---
That gem prices will spike from 8 silvers to 10 golds.
---
That not playing S01 will cripple your AP.
---
That you should hold onto your mystic conduit.
---
That you should farm the f**k out of lvl 10 BLC keys.
---
So many regrets.
---
Even my friends wouldnt lie saying its good hahaah, much less cool. Thanks alot though, im touched. ;_;
---
[removed]
---
Problem is, at lower levels you can outllevel the armor you wanted while waiting for it to be bought.
---
LOL npcs discussing the morality of killing dragons
---
Don't worry, despite being French I also find many French translations to be super cringy :p
---
Have to agree. It can be funny sometimes but Anet *really* likes to overdo this.
---
&gt;  But there is also quite alot of new dialogue about the dragons and the Sons of Svanir.
---
Will you release it in other video or I am missing something? I watched and didn't found that.
---
The best way to get Ley-Line crystals is from the events at each lane after you‚Äôve completed the lane specific meta.
---
Thanks for this! Just wanted to add, during Knut's holo speech at the beginning of your video, he has another another line at the end sometimes. Iv'e only heard the two so don't know if there's more, but instead of the "Do you need me to do that again" line he says something like "Only one take? Fantastic!"
---
Alright, we need a Knut Whitebear mount to see if he is just boasting about that wicked speed. Also, I really hope that Asura who speculates about the commander can break the 4th wall and realize the commander takes many forms.
---
Herald is not useless, it's a competent healer and boon provider, just lacks the fast ramp up of actual good boon givers like druid or chrono or renegade or firebrand. The role of herald is clear, to give boons, and utility buffs with the glint skills. It was never intended to be a good dps spec, it was only used before because quickness and alacrity uptimes were shit in early meta and impossible odds gave you that for free, so the old sword autos + permanent quickness were pretty good. If you only had HoT and really want to play rev, well just play it support, it's perfectly fine, with enough boon duration you can even give enough alacrity to 5 people for 100% uptime, counting with the extends of one inspiration Chrono. Spellbreaker is barely viable not because of the spec, but because warrior is super overturned so it doesn't matter what you slap on it, strength and discipline carry every single power build, specially discipline
---
If you are looking for viability, herald support is a perfectly viable second healer with access to plenty of boons and a lot of cc. Atm that is all herald can give. And that's fine imo.
---
If you aren't going to use them, then do whatever you want with them
---
Someone who doesn't understand achievements, probably.
---
He's definitely hating on Elder Dragons.
---
My least favorite thing is the fact we didn't get a home instance pinyata node. Like we got for every other holiday.
---
Closest to "midless farming" would be the silverwastes, where you have to run in circles defending the keeps. However, I still remember the 1.000.000 mobs I had to kill in lineage 2 in order to get from 79 to 80. You like doing that stuff?
---
ultimate dominator
---
Farming T3 leather or cloths from bag drops may be worth it.
---
Light in the Darkness is my favorite. Took some serious effort to complete it and I wanted the title specifically because it suited my character.
---
Seconded. I've been helping a friend's wife out and she's on an ele. The new player experience thing starts them out a lot slower than it used to be at launch, so the attunements get a lot more practice before the next one shows up. 
---
I suggest cleric's gear as it is tanky, still hits ok, and has a ton of recovery for mistakes. Glyphs are another recommendation - not only for the elementals but the healing one is pretty potent, especially in water attunement. It also is on a fairly short cool down with the air trait for them.
---
Seems it's old dialogue: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nora_Cedarhelm
---
Thanks for the screenshots anyway, didn't know about her, it's such a cool find lol.
---
And...?
---
Well if you look at asuran society, they value scientific results more than anything. So an organisation that makes it their main purpose to achieve results as fast as possible no matter the cost (Inquest), it‚Äôs natural that there will be at least some level of respect for them. However, if you listen to some ambient conversation around Rata Sum, you‚Äôll hear asurans complain about the inquest, which means that although there are some who respect and tolerate the inquest, there are some who express their disgust at them for ethical reasons. I‚Äôd say the inquest are in a gray area if you looked at it from an asuran perspective, like a chaotic neutral. Furthermore regarding their presence on the arcane council, it‚Äôs known that the councillors are ruthless and cunning, willing to do whatever it takes for Rata Sum, further pertaining to the idea that scientific results are highly valued in asuran society. The inquest embody that, and so it‚Äôs natural for an organisation like theirs to gain a spot on the arcane council.
---
Cool, thanks, I'll try it out, see if its worth
---
Yeah that's exactly what I meant
---
Someone who could kill 1 yak every minute for 174 days straight?
---
Now all you need is to get to 6969
---
Based on a bit of testing it seems the (current) transfer priority is:
---
1. Weakness
---
2. Blind
---
3. Cripple
---
4. Torment
---
5. Vulnerability
---
6. Poison
---
7. Bleeding
---
Buying the og wings is way cheaper on the TP. 80-90g I think?
---
Whenever you want anything that‚Äôs a ‚Äúsuper rare‚Äù drop, the most efficient way to get it is to grind gold/spend a few hours working at minimum wage for gold and just buy it from the tp or from r/gw2exchange
---
I use the full viper SB + D/T (with the use of quickdraw). Mainly because that's also my goto cDPS for raids, so I'm too lazy to change.
---
For open world, I'd advice the SB^^3 (Shortbow + Shortbow Soulbeast), which is also full viper, and that works well with only 1 SB (you only miss the weapon switch effects), remove the Quickdraw to take the Perforate trait, REALLY useful to tag up things in Open World.
---
Power builds are often better in open world simply because your condis need time to ramp up, while power are all about burst (that is even truer for Power SB as this class is full burst).
---
If you asked me simply for a soulbeast build, I'd have adviced to go the power route, but having mentioned condi, I spoke about the one I knew :)
---
I'm not super familiar with the mechanic overall, but wouldn't this be a buff? Poison harms your ability to be healed, whereas bleeding does not. Seems like this would be a survivability boost to me.
---
Whoa, a new Snargle reference!  Someone should inform u/Mons...oh, hi there!
---
they get 20 skills per weapon, so adding 20 more would be op
---
ground-targeted movement abilities (like druid staff 3) used to let you cast them in midair. they changed it a bit after HoT came out, so it‚Äôs probably not as intuitive to people these days to try that
---
I think one or two of them have auras of their own, although it could just be the same players repeatedly riding the same moas.
---
You lose 5 stacks of bleeding on the target for 1 stack of poision, considering you instantly clear the remaining condi on you with F2 it's a direct nerf to damage and irrelevant for survivability.
---
In PvP this may be true, but for PvE you're missing out on transferring 5 stacks of bleeding for ~20s which is pretty signficiant.
---
The potential for insane benchmarks with the combination of meteor shower and lava font + the whole sword/dagger kit would be a bit too much for pve. In pvp everyone would just run focus offhand for obsidian flesh, overall not a great idea
---
Interesting, it seems F2 now cleanses torment instead of poison as well. So they definitely changed priority.
---
Ah, ok. Yeah that‚Äôs why I‚Äôve gathered. Well, thank you for the advice I appreciate it.
---
Yeah that is true. Its the only place people can make a difference.
---
I mean, the non-Festival races are pretty solid, and are a nice challenge compared to the Hoelbrak one (which is a cakewalk once you get past the first hairpin turn). The Halloween one is absolutely a mess though, I really hope they replace it with a less terrible course this year.
---
Sometimes you can't fix the problem, just like you can't fix a broken car.
---
You'd better buy a new one, you'll save a lot of money and you won't find more problems you might have missed during the first repair session.
---
Probably now as lazy folks will pay their way through achievements. There won't be much need for them afterwards.
---
Adding banner of strength did indeed cause this issue to be "fixed". As they are using this buff in example though, perhaps it has something to do with your condition damage rather than the banner itself?
---
Caps are not fine. Why? Because those caps actually are the reason why Anets metrics are so skewed and since Anet likes to only look at their own skewed metrics, its why the game has been so horribly boring since LS3.
---
They look at their metrics and think "wow, LS is great, everybody still playing it after a week!"... when in truth most are just doing it because of daily cap.
---
Caps arent fine also because they limit weekend-players a LOT. I always get told that gw2 is for casual players, but at the same time, gw2 has the most horrendous reward system in place in current MMOs, all frontloaded into daily/weekly timegated rewards. If you are truly a casual player, you dont log in every day to slave away on your daily to-do list.
---
And caps arent fine because they artificially stretch boring content. Instead of anet developing more engaging content and/or a better scaling system for underpopulated events/maps, they slap a cap on everything to make everyone play it for longer. Truely lazy developing practice.
---
So far, festivals were excluded from this kind of lazy and horrible rewardsystem, which is why a lot players enjoyed them so much. Guess no longer.
---
It's not the banner itself, since just having multiple scourges around messing with skills would change the result (probably their might?).
---
We didn't dig deeper last time which attribute or the balance of those changes the remaining condition.
---
so zaytaffy now . coffers later right?

I think he meant fractal armor set with unique skins, which you would get as a reward for completing specific achievement(s). 
---
Something *hard* to get.
---
and this isn't anything new.
---
They're alright, I do mostly spend my time doing fractals or WvW, but it's not the same as just going into an open zone and just running around killing and looting
---
Is there a Non Holographic version? I feel the helmet is decent enough without that holo effect covering it
---
Also where is the backpack from?
---
Especially because the amount of active players owning it fades over time, even tho it was pretty easy to obtain back in the days.
---
Eh its really usable in any content, supbar to power reaper in fractals obviously but still mediocre if youre good
---
All I could hear when reading this is if you should dale zay taffay 
---
I‚Äôd hoard it honestly, but then I‚Äôm also not the person to ask so I‚Äôll shut up now
---
Its a utility weapon, the only skill that properly scales with power dmg is staff 4. The point of staff is aoe cc/utility, staff is well more suited for condi builds generally speaking. 
---
Both dagger and gs are better alternatives to staff for open world power builds.
---
As someone who is fairly new myself - tbh most of the metabattle open world builds are actually not that great when you're first starting out.  They're builds for max level characters to do max level stuff.  What you want when you're first starting out is a leveling build - and i have yet to find a good "hosted" resource for that, but did find some good posts on here about it (cant find right now, can add later).
---
Completely agree, but I think I'd rather see it be more of a bard style support specialization than a dps specialization. I think Bard would fit nicely with a Mesmer.
---
And still more boring than any other professions pre alpha skills
---
I wish they‚Äôd made rewards scale as the levels go higher. Would have been nice to have some recurring incentive to try harder.
---
Bind dodge to a button. It's just not worth the double tap, you'll fall off so many ledges.
---
Started playing a week ago, can confirm.

Good idea with the same attributes but different way.

Also got the different result. xD

With Chrono in mind, I think an elite spec for burst damage is more appeal.

better do a clean install of all mods/tools then. if d912pxy you will note that on character select screen icons

As someone who was never able to get into a static raid group, dislikes WvW, and isn't that great at PvP - I would kill to have the ability to get legendary armor from fractals. I PUG T4's almost every day, including CMs, and have a great time doing them and have multiple characters geared out for different roles. 
---
I can understand not adding legendary gear to Fractals, but having a legacy/brag armor set would be great, as all the other gamemodes have them. WvW, SPVP, Raids, Dungeons all have unique armor tied to them.
---
My French is weak, but if you need a Dutch translator, hmu
---
Read you skills and traits. Theyre usually balanced well enough to just compare what skill does which thing and how it relates to other Things your class does. 
---
Last time i checked Axe/Greatsword Reaper was a decent DPS. 
---
Generally speaking though, you should just Play the game first and experience the things yourself while leveling. You dont Need meta builds for any Content besides Raids, Fractals or the PvP modes and in open world, anything is viable (as Long as it's somewhat complimenting itself)
---
What is this mythical hornless unicorn you speak of?
---
I always use that for chat codes, like skins from that\_shaman's posts.
---
You also don't need to type your current character's name. Any character on the account will do. Really convenient if you've got a character with a simple to type one-word name.
---
Looks like the logo for HoT
---
This is how HoT got it's color scheme
---
Axe whorn with greatsword. Dont bother using axe autos unless you need to range. Axe 2 is where its at üëç
---
Right now, yes. Things can change drastically in a balance update. There was a lot of revamp going on when both batches of elite specs were released.
---
From PvE perspective:
---
Mirage is a condi dps spec. Chrono is good power spec but an even better support spec(still). 
---
Therefore the next spec will most likely be a power spec. 
---
Support is clearly the strongest part of Mesmer. A second support spec is therefore unlikely in my opinion.
---
You make that look smooth as fuck.
---
Last time I tried the catmander trick it didnt work, swapping commander and it auto turns normal tag when i gave to someone and when they gave to me it auto turned into catmander......
---
If she enjoyed running around Queensdale killing Moas for 2 hours, that's as good a place to start as any. My general starting-the-game advice, particularly for a super-new player, would be to pick a class that looks fun, try out all the weapons until you find a combination that you enjoy, explore the world and play through the story, and if you aren't enjoying a particular thing stop and go try something else. Presumably she's already got a reasonable grasp of the mechanics, so from there as long as she's using armor that's about the right level and having fun it doesn't really matter what you do. You'll probably be able to point her in the right direction once Traits come into the picture, but if you want a good rule of thumb just tell her to look for the Traits that enhance the weapons or skills she likes, then build outward from there.
---
Why rebalance chrono to have worse burst just to design a burst spec? Makes way more sense to just design a new spec with a different goal
---
Would have liked this video if that guy didn‚Äôt +1 them and ruin the montage.
---
They won't change drastically. Meanwhile mesmer still lacks a proper heal spec.
---
I know right?
---
What would be really interesting but would never happen is if there were like 9 episodes in season 5 and each one came out with a new spec.
---
Indeed! I tried replicating the setup in the video, even including order of skills on the utility bar, order of boons applied, and having a random scourge in the instance as well and I always got the poison lingering while I had a banner of strength. 
---
I also tested with a warrior-provided banner of strength, with and without Fell Beacon (which converts stats from banners but not pinpoint I think?), with corrupt boon instead of plaguelands. All gave the same results (poison remaining as long as I have the banner of strength buff). It would be good to see if anyone else is getting the lingering bleeding whilst still having banner of strength.
---
At this point I'm genuinely wondering if those Skyscale-collection buffs might somehow be responsible.
---
Wow it's that easy to get karma on /r/guildwars2 , just post a random fanart everyday and ask for a very generically wanted elite spec!
---
YES
---
PLEASE
---
I would instantly craft the Dreamer even though I already have Chuka
---
It would be hilarious if it turned out to be a melee weapon when used by a mesmer.
---
&gt; (1) It feels like my burst skills - regardless of weapon - don't do much...
---
Burst skills, such as Eviscerate and Arcing Slice deal significant damage, but aren't flashy. More than anything, they are used primarily for the Berserker's Power trait.
---
&gt; (2) The trait Doubled Standards...
---
It includes any unique Warrior Banner effect, regardless of source.
---
&gt; (3) Are there any breakbar options I should be aware of? 
---
Dual mace deals the most breakbar damage, followed by mace &amp; shield, and then hammer. You should also have Bull's Rush, and Kick/Throw Bolas as part of your kit, anyway.
---
&gt; (4) What are my options to break out of a knockdown? 
---
"Shake It Off!" is probably the most versatile. It breaks stun, as well as remove conditions.
---
Norn's festival should include drinking and smashing stuff. Asurans could have sudden death spelling bees or anything intelligence related yet goofy. Sylvari could get something similar to the blossoming of Sakuras, but Sylvari'd. Charr could have anything related to the military or agility contest cuz you know, big fluffy cats. As for human, well anything human usually celebrate, that side is already well covered x).
---
Any other ideas?(:
---
What item/infusion/weapon etc gives [this purple-and-gold-sparkles effect](https://imgur.com/a/h1uhStN)? Saw it on this ranger a couple of days ago and have been trying to figure out what it is but I'm out of ideas.
---
Yes please!!! I wanna use my dreamer weapon on my mesmer! 
---
A minstrel/bard support/dps spec with songs instead of shatters would be awesome.
---
Then leave it out more and tell us what color is after!
---
Sylvari = Pale Mothers Day
---
Even in pvp it's not used because staff is more flexible. Herald also has nothing that improves condi playstyle.
---
Because he doesn't waste it on shite deals.
---
Hammer deals more CC than mace/shield, and without a sigil of paralysation it deals more CC than mace/mace as well.
---
It doesn‚Äôt have to be anything new. It‚Äôs just a player excited about a find and wants to share it with people. Geez. It‚Äôs new for ME as well, so I‚Äôm glad OP decided to post it. It‚Äôs really cool.
---
For what reason is trailblazer, a condi stat, even an option for a power/boon heavy spec?
---
Probably crusader because of boon duration, but as other comment says, none of these stats are useful and shield has pretty limited uses as well.
---
It's the reason I really want Jormag content. It's the only Dragon with sentient followers and when we defeat it, the Sons of Svanir's culture will be flipped over on its head and the Dragon's defeat would have extra repercussions.
---
I can see the bundle now :)
---
Green...purple...
---
...orange is the only secondary color left. So I'll say orange, or blue.
---
This isn't really a balance issue for Anet to deal with. It is the community that decided to sell those for 16g not Anet. We are the ones that assign the value of these items on the TP. So this isn't a feature or unbalanced it is us. This is a player driven economy and these prices are dictated by the players.
---
Anet can only adjust drop rates but after playing this event for a bit obtaining these items are not difficult nor does it take a long time so that is not the issue. However for some reason, most likely greed, we inflated the price.
---
I am personally expecting blue because water, but what if they go greyscale and then the story is all about how we lose and the whole planet gets destroyed!

Guild Wars 2: Tyria's Last Breath!

Hah

Amazing as amways.

And for those new to the game wondering how hard these dungeons are, though you can duo them when you know all the enemies and attacks, soloing them is extremely hard, impossible to me.
---
Hot is a perfect examaple of something that has been in the sun for too long.
---
I'm still looking into this, but it seems to be a very rare, specific case that I am having trouble reproducing. For now, I would suggest putting in a ticket for this so we can see what state your account is in. This may help replicate the issue which would lead to finding the core bug sooner.  
---
I apologize for the frustration this is undoubtedly causing you.
---
&gt; They share extremely similar themes and playstyles.
---
They do, but they also have enough differences to... differ. In WoW the whole Nature magic aspect and the bound to the nature is part of a different class, the Druid. The Hunter is more like a tamer and survivalist, while GW2's Ranger also has these aspects *plus* a heavy nature magic aspect. 
---
If you really want to compare WoW and GW2 stuff, you need to compare both Hunter AND Druid with the ranger. 
---
However, keep in mind that the main question was, if there are any rangers in other MMO's who uses a rifle. And the answer is now. WoW doesn't have a ranger class, even though the Hunter uses some similar aspects.
---
1000 Dragon Coffers opened got 5 Jorbreakers.
---
Think of all the little tricks and "I wish I knew" stuff that you know. 
---
Then set it off to the side. Be ready to pause for a moment and explain something as it comes up. Basically, be her tutorial experience when the game isn't doing it.  Drip-feed info so it's not a huge, intimidating info dump. 
---
Also, goals. Find out what hers are and create a path to reach them.  
---
Drag her on a foray into WvW and see if she likes it. If she has a complaint that isn't a dealbreaker for the game mode, you can help resolve those.   
---
Show her the fashion endgame and the wardrobe; the bank can show almost all the skins and give her something to work toward even when you're not playing together.   
---
Coax her into exploration and map completion. As long as something is unexplored, she'll have something to go toward rather than spinning in circles killing yellow mobs.
---
I've always thought of Harvest Moon festival as the Sylvari festival option. But then again, that's thematically Autumn (= "elderliness") which doesn't really fit a young race; so, maybe the Hanami equivalent would indeed make more sense, maybe even celebrated together with some Canthan folk once/if we get to Cantha.
---
My point on that is even if Anet increases the drop rate that wont stop the real problem. The real problem is we are always setting prices really high and we are the ones that keeps buying stuff at inflated prices.
---
So let's say Anet increases the drop rates. Well they are not going to increase it by that much because then everyone will just grind the content for 1-2 days to get everything then not deal with the content again. So the prices wont change that much. Maybe go down by a gold or two.
---
We also have to remember that this is an event that might be returning (considering the annual achievement) and isn't meant for everyone to get everything the first time through. So they expect players to work on this for a few cycles of the event. 
---
Balance is more then just how much value the community puts on an item. We can say we want this now and let this drop more so we can complete it. Then next year we start complaining that there is nothing new to get in the event because we already got it. Then we will say they should have release new items for this year. So they move more devs to do this now we have less devs working on other content, which we will complain about less releases in that content.
---
So, I'm guessing here, they are most likely balancing it to allow the content for last as long as possible with the current resources available to them. Also they are not going to be able to accurately predict the value we put on items when we are selling them on the TP.
---
So, down clocked cpu to standard and ran for a few days and still crashes. Stress tested my gpu for about a day with furmark and no problems?? Wtf. Should I lodge a ticket with gw2 support team?

Bit of truth to this! One of the reasons couples often use tank/healer dynamics to go through dungeons in an MMO. If OP runs a similarly complimentary pair, they can enjoy that effectiveness together.

I assume that's **EU** since I've seen your guild portaling people to daily JPs on EU and since you use CET time.

Really? They keep the tooth of Jormag in a place of honor and regularly test themselves trying to break it, in anticipation of the day they'll be able to defeat Jormag (a moot point for now, I suppose, but the city still exists in a frozen time before Jormag went back to sleep). IMO, these people are all about dragon bashing!
---
Hi Crim üëã üòÇ
---
I'm sorry to hear that didn't mean to ruin your day
---
Start practicing your rotation early! Especially if you are playing a DPS class. 
---
I am not even kidding. For example as a guardian with greatsword you always want to hit your skills in a certain order: (F1), GS4, move to cancel the aftercast, GS2. 
---
Look up your rotation on snowcrows and see if there are chunks that you can practice while leveling.
---
To continue with the theme of the mesmer's weapons. Being the shortbow a ranged weapon, mesmers should be able to use them on melee somehow. Maybe shooting him/her self through the arrows.
---
Once the item is in your inventory you'llbe able to ping it just fine.
---
However, you won't be able to show its stats because its a selectable item - its stats will appear blank to anyone else.
---
I see a toughness Chrono, a heal Chrono, a dps Chrono and a dps mirage, looks like you need a warrior. 
---
Flipping the old dungeon meta of 4 warriors and a Mesmer.
---
Come off it, please. There are plenty of jokes that no one finds offensive. It's not really that hard to come up with jokes that don't deliberately tear other people down, and if you can't think of one, then then problem isn't everyone else's lack of humor, it's your lack of ability.
---
Not sure what the complaining charr has to do with that, anyway! I personally think it's a pretty funny way of gently poking fun at the community's reaction to Kralk.
---
Reminds of the story of Pandora. Opened a box containing woe and suffering. Difference is she also found hope in her box.
---
That's like blaming participants in the real-life economy when things aren't going right, rather than poor governance and poor monetary policy.  I mean, sure, few enough participants can price-fix and whatnot, but when the population gets large enough you can't really blame them for the laws of supply and demand doing what they do.

Everyone going on about "a festival for every city!"
---
Here I'm just wishing they'd do what they did with Wintersday 2012, and have *all* cities involved with every festival to some degree. Or at the very least, have every festival be "Lion's Arch + 1 racial city", with a larger focus on the racial city than LA. Under that concept:
---
* Halloween: Lion's Arch + Black Citadel
---
* Winter's Day: All Cities
---
* Lunar New Year: Lion's Arch + Divinity's Reach
---
* SAB: Lion's Arch + Rata Sum
---
* Dragon Bash: Lion's Arch + Hoelbrak
---
* Festival of the Four Winds: Lion's Arch + The Grove
---
Just move the Crown Pavilion part of FotFW to be part of Lunar New Year (which already incorporates the Crown Pavilion anyways), and make a new activity for FotFW featured in The Grove.
---
More icons can be found here:  [https://elonian-gallery.com/](https://elonian-gallery.com/)

Neither would the charr. At least some of them view it more as a Flame Legion victory than charr victory (per Iron March's searing cauldrons events) and want to remove traces of it.

Is there anyway to backup and restore keybinds?  I want to try completely remapping my keys from WASD to ESDF (new keyboard I got lends itself better to ESDF), but if it doesn't work out I'm hoping for an easy way to restore the WASD config.
---
Stay away from blood magic/death magic/minions.
---
The damage is abysmal and the playstyle is zzz.
---
Try spite/soul reaping/reaper. Do some actual damage instead of being a walking zombie petting zoo.
---
Are you one of those commanders who deliberately tricks people into death, keeps a kill count, and mocks those who die?
---
I ask because I join HP trains pretty regularly (altaholic!) and while there are several very good commanders who run regularly, and I personally don't mind the occasional joke that makes someone fall to their death, I had a horrible experience with one not long ago. I have a friend who's not super enthused about the game, whom I've been trying to get more interested in it. She leveled her character the old-fashioned way to 80, doesn't log in much though, and I convinced her to join me for this HP train so she could unlock an elite specialization and hopefully feel more effective (and have more fun/enjoy the game more).
---
This commander deliberately led people to their death numerous times in Verdant Brink alone (portaled them into the poison vines, jumped off cliffs and flew them into the death floor, etc.). I have all the masteries and the experience to avoid most of these instances, but she and many other newbies did not -- and my friend ended up getting frustrated to tears and logged out. When confronted about driving a new player away from the game, the commander and her cronies laughed, claimed they had "scored one", and mocked me for having no sense of humor and that it was my friend's fault for not "enjoying the game for what it is" and "not getting HP the way a newbie should". I stayed with the train regardless because I felt a stubborn sense of defiance in not wanting to be another "score", but in the end I regretted it because the train took nearly 4 hours due to the constant detours and having to rez people back/wait for large groups to rejoin us from waypoints. A good commander, as you know, can get it done with minimal deaths or issues in 2 to 2 and a half hours.
---
My friend still hasn't logged back into the game since then, and it hurts knowing that someone who's dear to me will probably never join me in the game I love, all because of someone's twisted sense of humor. Of course, a commander can run their train however they want -- but I'd at least like to know ahead of time if they're a sadist, so I can make the choice to avoid that particular run and go with a commander who actually cares about the people they're leading.

\*PrtScr
---
back in hot condi rev was meta in gvgs/wvw.
---
If there are more mobs to hit, and the mobs live longer than 4 seconds each, more people will get credit and more zhaitaffy is made available.
---
Either sell them asap or hold them for a long time.
---
k
---
Because people are having trouble getting kill credit for mobs. The mobs are weak and die fast, and unless your playing one of the better cleave classes like Reaper or DH, you'll get less tags, and less credit or no credit according to people on the sub... I play DH so its less of an issue for me.
---
That‚Äôs my favorite feastival during the month of steaktember.
---
Thanks!
---
Good art and armours (What are those legs?) but yeah, her right leg x)
---
On the other hand the mobs taking a lot longer to die means fewer killed and fewer drops.
---
Sure it might fix the credit issue but the impact on zhaitaffy supply is questionable. I say might because the actual underlying issue is unknown. This is probably best demonstrated by the Caledon wurm's pre-event. I can get credit from all 3 champions with the bags to prove it but still not get credit for the event.
---
Getting credit for kills/events and event scaling are two of the longest existing problem in the game that ANet has done nothing to address.
---
I think she wants to talk to you
---
Very nice!
---
So what you'r saying is you got a free upgrade to HoT right? :D

there's no zhaitaffy cobbler for free xp booster @ wvw xD
---
To be fair, for every person who reacts poorly to criticism, there's another person who *is* toxic and then tries to claim they're just "being helpful" (much like bullies who constantly torment other people and then try to claim "it's just a joke, bro".)
---
IMO, many people who offer "constructive criticism" aren't actually being constructive at all. They're just flat-out venting their own frustrations, picking a scapegoat, and going to town.
---
If you're going to offer constructive criticism, you need to:
---
1. Make sure you're experienced enough to know what you're talking about. I don't correct other players who are on classes/builds that I personally do not play, though I may offer general suggestions if they ask (like they may be accidentally cancelling skills too soon, etc.). Are you experienced enough to be 100% sure that they're the problem? Or are you just looking for someone to blame and glossing over the mistakes of yourself and your friends and not acknowledging that you may also be contributing to the problem?
---
2. Assess your own mental state, and be honest with yourself. You don't get to claim that you're just "being honest" with other people if you refuse to be honest with yourself. What is your goal in correcting them? Are you coming from a place of anger and frustration? Are you trying to assign blame and punish? Or are you genuinely wanting to help them improve?
---
3. Consider your approach. Calling someone out by name in front of the whole raid is *not* going to get a fair reaction from them, because you're piling more onto them than just the correction. You've stacked the deck against them by humiliating them first, so of course they're going to react poorly to criticism that they might have accepted okay in other circumstances! You've also opened up the rest of the group to pile onto them, too, and nobody reacts positively when they feel like they're being dogpiled. Nor should they. It hurts and feels excessive, regardless of whether the criticism is fair or not. In order to be fair criticism, it also has to be given in a fair way.
---
4. Related, but: be positive. If you start your criticism with "Dude you suck", you've just closed the door. Any reasonable human being is going to get defensive after that. It helps a lot to start off by complimenting them on something they're doing well, or recognizing that they're making an effort. "Hey, you're keeping those boons up pretty well, but I noticed you're getting teleported a lot and it's really affecting your DPS. \[Insert tip for noticing/not getting teleported here.\]" No, I'm not saying to make up shit if they're not doing *anything* well... but nine times out of ten, a player who's actually trying *is* doing something well even if they're struggling in other areas, and if you can't take the time to notice that, then you probably shouldn't be the one offering the criticism because you're clearly coming at this from a bad perspective (see above).
---
That said, there's nothing wrong with being frustrated, too. That's a natural reaction. Just make sure that your frustration isn't coloring how you interact with people. If you're rude, mean, and aggressive, you can't really blame people for getting defensive. There are some really great, patient commanders who play this game, and yes, there are also some people who won't accept any criticism no matter how genuinely and nicely it's given. You can't really help those people. But if you really want the raid scene to grow stronger, it's important to foster those who are honestly trying to learn, not tear those people down. If you want a garden, you have to water and care for your plants, not take a weed whacker to them because you're mad they aren't growing fast enough.

Anet devs already said they're working on an annual holiday centered around PvP and WvW. This would be perfect if it was captured, lore-wise in the Black Citadel for the warring Charr. Give us non-guild hall dueling in that pit as well.
---
I'm just sad we got a normal mount race instead of a drunken norn piggyback race, honestly.
---
Or if the Druid waited 10 seconds after someone got low to heal them.
---
Unless you're solo, the holograms die very, very fast. Makes it hard to tag kills. But I'm not talking about increasing their health anyways; I'm talking about number of spawns, same as how haunted doors upscale during Halloween.
---
More spawns = more chances to hit = more drops.
---
Yes, but he is specifically telling you that he's not a very casual player who needs those things.
---
&gt; getting the ball rolling!
---
It was already on the wiki before OP posted.
---
That makes sense! I guess I was wondering if it was like rare unid bags- I tend to open and salvage for ectos vs selling the bags or gear directly becaus eI ‚Äúthink‚Äù I make more on random batches of ectos than if I had sold them :0
---
Hoelbrak. It was nice before but had a lot of empty space. Now it feels alive and populated like a real capital city.
---
Sorry but you're  wrong.
---
For example: what if ArenaNet decided to lower the amount of zhaitaffy required for the various items? What if they added the option to use a different currency which is easier to come by? What if they changed it so the conversion of zhaitaffy to jorbreakers required fewer zhaitaffy?
---
None of those require a change to how zhaitaffy is obtained.
---
I think you are confusing crusader with commander. Commander is power, precision, concentration, toughness. Crusader is power, toughness, ferocity, healing power.
---
So, an event where you have to have fun without being showered in loot ...  What's the world coming to?
---
Do something else (that counts as a NO vote).
---
Thank you so much for this heads up! I‚Äôve been eyeing the saber for my Norn mesmer for a long while
---
Ah, my mistake. I'm not interested in quick flips, I enjoy playing the long game.
---
It does actually, except for channeled skills that started the channel before stealth was entered. After the channel ends targeting is broken. 
---
Stealth does nothing against Cleave and AoE, which is why those are the hard counters unless the stealthed person is running away, as that makes range useless.
---
Ah. Here on NA it's a spectacle if there's anything but selling on LFG at all.
---
You really only needed the first sentence.
---
That's a lotta waving!
---
I don't see any other options
---
&gt; assuming it's even annual like other festivals.
---
 It will be. We have annual achievment and repeatable 20 year achievment as well.
---
well I couldn't even open it.... I don't know what do do honestly, sorry to be such a noob.
---
HAVE YOU HEARD OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOR PALAWA JOKO?
---
when you have problems with tagging try to join a squad. you get "faster" tagging, when ppl in your squad dmg the same enemy too.
---
also dont hang out where everyone hangs out before the event starts. try to remember were some enemy group spawn and go to more remote areas so you can trigger the holo thingy and tag enemies first.
---
There is no doubt that it's a grind if you don't already have the map tokens on hand from daily home instances.   The wonderful thing is, after you're done with the skyscale, then there is VISION and COALESSENCE that need those same map tokens again, as well as Funerary Incense.  
---
But realistically, I don't think a grind is bad for elite items.  It certainly brought back some life to some really dead maps.  And players should expect to work hard for elite items.
---
&gt; decentralize the human aspect of the game.
---
Uhm, the way Norn are portrayed in the game still makes me perceive them just as "large cold-resistant humans who like to brawl and drink". IIRC they were supposed to be way larger, but gameplay couldn't make it work, and the same happened to shape-shifting, so we have what we have.
---
So yeah, I wish we had more focus on the less humany species down the road instead.
---
I disagree. Firstly, people began going around as a blob but ceased because they couldn't tag enough kills because no upscaling in foe numbers.
---
Secondly, while there is a timer, the 5 minutes per round is far more than enough tim to clear out the 15 to 30 projectors. Even the third round is always completed within two minutes tops, even with no organization, tag, or numbers. The projectors are in set locations so given time people can figure out an ideal rotation to get all 30 as a single group within those 5 minutes regardless of upscaling quantities.
---
Thirdly, if needed, the projectors can give multiple waves or extended timer no biggie. People already want more of the stampede anyways, though moat commonly I see a request for a boss at the end.
---
[shouting from across Southsun Cove] EXCUSE ME, DO YOU HAVE A MOMENT?
---
Just be careful, as a modeler, I'm sure you know how quick companies are to get people who reverse engineer their IP. Safest bet would be to review their vlogs and such from back in developmental stages.
---
They probably use the first time to see how it goes, then change it for the next time around. Probably just being cautious in case their is some exploit / fuck up or whatever.
---
Cool thanks.
---
To elaborate, OP's choices are either sell them ASAP or hoard them for a whole year. Profit is higher to hoard, of course, but then there's the opportunity cost of the non-liquid asset just sitting there waiting for maturity, as well as the inventory slots used up.
---
We have only 3 festivals left to have 1 per playable race:
---
* Meatoberfest for Charr, of course. It could include:
---
 * The Bane, in which you fight waves of enemies and bosses. But instead figuring out builds to beat them you are given the choice of different fixed builds and figure ways to use them to beat as many waves of enemies as possible. Your skills and stats would change with a transformation, and there could be 1 build per playable profession, then skill sets from story and other content like the Avatar of Balthazar form, the Golem prototype from Air Drop, or Sohothin's skills from To Kill a God, or even the Dune Roller from WvW. 
---
 * A global meat-cooking contest between the races of Tyria. Players gather ingredients across the world (some of them rare drops from certain champions, bounties and less visited meta-events) and give them to the cooks. At the end of the festival Smodur the Unflinching decides the winner, and players receive in the mail rewards based on how many ingredients they gave, and how many they gave to the winner. So nobody misses out, players don't have to be present during the judging and they'll be able to give ingredients to all the cooks.
---
 * A Sylvari with a vegetarian stand, giving away a "Meat substitute" recipe, and also selling meatless alternate recipes for popular foods like Truffle Steak, that use the meat substitute and still "look at taste like meat".
---
* For the Sylvari, it could be one these options: 
---
 * "Pale Mother's Day", sometime during May, celebrating spring and the Pale Mother.
---
 * Or since humans can't definitely go without the Jubilee and have 3 festivals already, the sylvari could try a PR stunt to improve their image for those who still mistrust them after the Mordrem thing, and get Wintersday to move to their city. 
---
* And of course move Canthan new year would be moved to the Tengu city as soon as they finally become playable and get more and improved things to do.
---
[Nuuvem](http://www.nuuvem.com/item/guild-wars) has both expansions on sale right now. $15 USD each.
---
I was actually thinking about wanderer lol.
---
Crusader still seems like the best option here considering that herald has 40% crit chance from fury permanently.
---
Asura have SAB
---
There isn't even a home instance pi√±ata node to buy.
---
&gt; ecto were up to 45s a peice, which was unreasonable.
---
There were also much fewer rares dropped, Pof  and S4 maps vomit loot at you now. I kinda liked seeing that rare drop or exotic and it being worth a considerable sum. Now its just another item that dropped and forgotten about faster than it scrolls by in the feed.
---
or it's just an eternal punishment
---
It fits so well, especially given sirens call underwater with the trident. Could stand to have a whole build with abilities like that.
---
I'm EU the website doesn't let me purchase it, says it's unavailable in my region.
---
Well, the way I see it, the charr were definitely happy to take back Ascalon and do celebrate it. In fact, the charr PC even comments "we were just returning the favor" at the end of Bastion of the Penitent to justify why the Charr invaded Kryta, even though most of the campaigns at that time were orchestrated by the Flame Legion.
---
... get out ..... :P
---
It's nearly impossible to tag the holos in open world before they disappear, and the events won't spawn more fast enough.
---
If the events kept spawning other holograms until the central 'veteran' creature is defeated like in Dragonfall's veteran events, but much faster, people could have a chance to tag more and get more zhaitaffy drops.
---
Yeah, but those aren't materials. You can't put them in your material bank.
---
If you use a waypoint mid event, does it cancel anything? Can I try that as well?
---
Pure bliss!
---
&gt; AP is always more valuable than coin.
---
Depends on the player.
---
I agree. By the time I get to a point I literally about face and run to the next that i most likely wont make it to. People are literally flying over mountains.
---
Yeah using 2 midair really helps a lot to change direction or just to get to the ground below. You can also drift midair with skill 3.
---
If you have a VPN you can bypass the Nuuvem region lock. The game codes themselves don't have a region restriction, only nuuvem does.
---
&gt; ...grind out the heart vendors day by day...
---
You know there are other activities you can do to get map currency right? If you are in a rush to get the currency you need, farming yourself into a stupor is all on you imo.
---
That‚Äôs sad to hear :&lt; 
---
I was excited to see the coffers selling for 45s and sad to see it down in the 30s now. Haven‚Äôt had the time to farm and sell stuff (and trying to figure out if I should or get whatever exclusive cosmetics they have up) 
---
Feels like if I don‚Äôt panic sell then I may have to bank it for a year! (assuming they do this event again next year)!
---
I disagree.  I just finished getting all the AP I can from the stampede and don't have any plans on returning.   Repeating the stampede gets boring quickly and I want to work on gets mats for Coalessence.  Other people are likely to go back to working on Vision and the Skyscale.
---
For me, the rest of the festival will just be to complete the 3 fastest dailies and then on to other content.
---
Oh, they were happy to get Ascalon back. But the Searing was what brought down the wall, not what conquered Ascalon. Ascalon still stood for another decade+. And while the invasions into Kryta and Orr were ordered by the Flame Legion, the others weren't against them.
---
But: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ironhead_Lake#Ambient_dialogue
---
They're non-too-fond of the Searing Cauldrons. Or any magic. So they wouldn't likely be celebrating the magical ritual that brought down the wall, since that didn't win them the war.
---
Why remain limited by a single festival/event though?
---
TL;DR: be aware of your surroundings. Take it slowly, look around you, go where something interesting is likely to happen.
---
That's the eternal coliseum. 
---
You're stuck on that screen for eternity.
---
Are you not entertained?
---
You don't need the booster. You could also tag along with someone else that is lv80 and unlock the raptor that way.
---
Free feel to use wps, no cancelling will take place.
---
Probably farming Zhaitaffy?
---
Don't forget Moovember!
---
Lunar new year is still a human festival, not a Tengu.
---
if all i want is those currencies so i can get the saddle, and nothing else, what do you call trying to get those currencies? it's a grind, repeating the same content over n over until you get it.
---
Guardian. 
---
The theme's class around protect allies and that kind of stuff fits really well with a support build. 
---
In Fractals: most Pugs will be running the Firebrigade duo (Firebrand + Renegade) and in most cases one is gonna be the healer; mostly Firebrand casue its more "pugfriendly".
---
You can go into raids as a Healbrand (Healing Firebrand), or as a Support-dps (Quickbrand either condi or power).  If any lfg on raids says "healer" you can go with any healer.
---
But if you really like the support role, you can't go wrong with Guardian, because you can support your party even going full damage.
---
Plus: Its meta support in WvW and PvP.
---
i just got back playing right now. i need to buy the expansions and the living world content. money is more important rn
---
But what about condi herald?
---
I can *hear* the pocket raptors already...
---
How do they compare to Renegade? I was looking at making a support type character after I get my engineer rolling and haven't decided on one yet.
---
They‚Äôre really not the be all end all best support anymore. FB/Ren are comparable/better now in a lot of situations.
---
They're both useful but imo a good chrono can fill more rolls. But each boss can vary. If ur undecided, u can't go wrong with making a chrono - just be prepared to practice alot with it work on soloing aspects like the escort cave. But ul always find a squad which will take u once u get good.
---
They *were* the absolute best for a long time but Firebrand/Renegade are also comparable/better now depending on situation.  People just haven‚Äôt caught up 100% yet
---
I still. Avoid them on the skyscale.
---
And when someone drops one of these by a chest in Auric Basin and suddenly a dozen players are teleported out and lose all their rewards?
---
Not sure how far you are in your leveling but have a wee look:
---
[https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Warrior\_-\_Gotta\_Go\_Fast](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Warrior_-_Gotta_Go_Fast)
---
Well Welcome back to the game :)
---
Take your time to re-learn or many even make a new character to get back in to it. Later on there is two expansions to buy and also seasons. Lots of new features that made the endgame veyr different.
---
Ill give it a shot. But I‚Äôm not missing out on like the majority of I don‚Äôt have expansions like with WoW, right?
---
It could be that I'm still new, but I hate weapon swapping haha. I'll get used to it eventually I guess
---
If it's not a great idea, why bring it up?
---
You need to drop Defense and take up Strength instead. That way you'll gain access to the Berserker's Power trait that makes you do up to 21% more damage for 15s after using a Burst skill, as well as flat 120 power from the Forceful Greatsword trait. Also, you should really pick the Berserker elite spec (replacing Arms) instead of Spellbreaker, as it has superior damage in all game modes except WvW, as long as boon-stripping is not required of you in a group.
---
After Wildstar was closed Rift deffo have the very best housing system out there. You can build anything and everything and get the decorations as loot and rewards and what not. Usually they just pile up. Anyway, what i was gonna say about this, is that RIFT also made a way for anyone to visit your instance (if you want to open it up for outsiders that is). You then teleport in to it and can watch what they done or how something progress or try out what ever they built. It is easy to join and leave and you can not destroy anything or move or change anything just visit and have a look around and try out the stuff. It cost nothing and you can also vote for it if you like it or not so that people see it better. 
---
Guild halls are not real housing but still this is the one thing RIFT made in a good and simple wat and gave the players everything and anything they needed to make what ever they wanted without going broke.
---
I play Firebrand and always get a TON of tags and drops in other events in the game that feature this kind of mass AoE tagging type situation, but it's still very hit or miss with the stampede unless I'm one of the first fourish people there.
---
Fair point^^
---
&gt; A 5-minute cooldown has been added to prevent the rapid looting of the Aquatic Ruins Fractal boss chest.
---
And there it goes lol
---
I figured it would be Meep. 
---
Stand around at the NPCs for a bit. We are watching the formation of the cult of M E E P.
---
Perhaps I'm too much a cynic by the answer seems obvious to me.   They WANT the source to be scarce to push up gem-&gt;gold sales.
---
do this rotation on any mob in the openworld / dungeons and it melts.  
---
swap out the mantra to utilities like reflect, phantasmal defender for "tanking" or the dmg well, depending on the situation.
---
People are mostly speaking in terms of raid damage because you really don't need to optimize much in open world for damage. Reaper has the advantage of pretty much self buffing solo while Chrono do need some support.
---
That being said, Reaper has a very easy rotation as well because you can practically hit any button and still do decently well. Damage chrono do require knowing when to press buttons. So try look at this for some sort of idea on how to play it.

goodjob. you screwed yourself over. :)
---
HEYYYYYYY WE DOING RIBA IN SW, JOIN US PLEBS. :D PLENTY OF ROOM!
---
Seems like there is still no reason to do the survival dragon bash mode besides getting the 10 stacks achiev on the eye, i thought they were going to add progressive rewards but nope.     
---
Lame.
---
totally agree :)
---
YAS QUEEN
---
WORK
---
It's just really annoying that some random bumping can determine whether or not you can take that turn smoothly.
---
Camo Wars 2
---
A farm that requires more coordination and skill than world bosses auto attack fiesta? Unacceptable &gt;:(
---
AYYYYYYYYY LMAO.
---
What is impressive is that you made "mistakes" and i'm pretty you could reach 29. 
---
Very, very, very well done.
---
yet another farm gets nerfed to the ground gg anet
---
I'm getting like, Pokemon Secret Base vibes
---
Go on...
---
yeah and gold farming bots in pvp and multiboxing is perfectly fine. give me a fucking break
---
it was a very very well thought out guide, but 100g/h DONT POST THAT SH!T ON REDDIT XD just keep it to yourself.
---
I'm confused by it all truth be told, i pop into Hoelbrak, looked around, popped a few pinata's and could really see anything else to do and left.
---
Please don't make me go back to The Grove :( I get lost every time!
---
After the rage inducing levels of tangled depths the grove is like navigating a step stool.
