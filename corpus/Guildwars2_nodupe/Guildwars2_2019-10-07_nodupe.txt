How in gods name do they need more than six different armour configurations for a single character? I suppose under the rare chance they happen to be both an active pvp and pve player then its less fair, but damn man - the fuck.
---

---
Two armour configurations and three spec slots per character at a base seems pretty fair to me, it covers both my main and Chrono immediately for both their alternate sets and frankly as of right now is just a bonus for other characters, as their roles are so simple and or specific that build templates aren't even required. 
---
I'm sorry, but this feature does benefit me, is intended for players like myself and I don't have a problem with how it works or how it's monitized.
---
---
---
I'll raise you 9 female Norn.....I got my reasons
---
Lol I think you live in an alternative reality.
---
Up to you what you want to do.  GW1 still doesn't have equipment templates in PvE.
---
In what world is detection pulse not useful in PvP? Do you not have thieves on the enemy team? Or engineers using toss elixir to stealth the whole team on the opening fight? Use your brain, man. The idea that detection pulse is only useful in WvW is idiotic.
---
You know what's worse? Deleting an ascended item by mistake while deleting all the other shit.
---
I don't know, I just know it's a question worth asking. In my case, the current system does make it a bit more worth it for me to craft legendary armor, because the armory solves the problem of having to carry every other piece of gear required for a different build.
---
&gt; Much of the work they did wasn't saved
---
That is probably some sort of misunderstanding because doing game development without some sort of version control system seems insane. 
---
I think it was mentioned at some point that they use Perforce for that so the stuff should still be around. That being said it might not help much since diving into old code that works with old versions of other code might take more work than rewriting from scratch.
---
The open world stuff is probably not resusable regardless of the state of the code if the goal is something more like LS2,3,4,5.
---
The value of making those can probably be easily estimated from how many people buy the LS2,3,4 episodes.
---
It doesnt need to be on steam, it has it's own launcher. It's not like it uses epic launcher, why would you want it to be on steam when you can play steam games on your screen while nothing is going on on gw2 on your second screen.
---
There is no truth to be had without the data from Anet. LOL.
---
I already told you weeks ago that trying to get the last word in doesn't make you right.  You are slow.  And desperate to rationalize anything to try to be right; going first from saying you don't need data, to then claiming you are using data, to then excluding data again.

---
This is the nicest way I've ever heard "there's no class that lets you get away with so much lazy play" phrased.
---
I'm not sure what you're trying to say because I never suggested that 'GW2 could keep going for 15 years'. That's a completely different matter. I just think that when GW2 stops being sustainable, Anet will focus on another game that probably won't even be an MMO.   
---
Also, Blizzard have much more resources and WoW desperately needs to update their graphics as often as possible because it looks extremely dated. Even with all those improvements it still looks much worse than GW2.
---
Then why do you ask? But maybe don't provoke.
---
They're really not that comparable
---
Dude, noone ever said the contrary. 
---
A  non perfect minmax build u can play properly will still be shit, and hamper your group over a decent, vaguely optimized build. If you can't put the effort to inform yourself on what's efficient and how to play it, along with the strategies to adopt while playing in a group, why should I bother taking you in an instance and having to carry you through it ?
---
That's exactly my point. MMOs are a risk - especially in the current climate. Why not develop a mobile game or something entirely different?   
---
Obviously, I'd rather have a GW3 than a mobile game but I never said I don't want GW3 to be a thing. I'm just saying I don't think it'll be a thing.
---
They'll start working on a new game that has nothing to do with Guild Wars imo.
---
Problem is, after banwave of characters in Malchor's Leap (falsepositive) they straight up turned system off and seems like ignoring all reports as well. Around 6-7 accounts farming wood with simple script for solid 1.5 years. Despite all my efforts nothing happened with them.
---
How many MMOs  that have more than one sequel do you know?
---
Provisioner tokens. Chak eggs. T6 trophies. 1-3 raid-ready builds that you feel comfortable with - one power dps, one condi dps, one support of some kind.
---
Reasoning: Tokens take forever as a timegated thing, and they’re cheaper if you spread them out over time doing the cheaper exchanges and ignoring the expensive ones. 
---
Chak eggs means catching a LOT of gerent dailies, where successful completion relies on a lot of other people being interested in gerent at the same time. Find and learn a good time for your timezone and show up like clockwork. You can also use the gerent as a practice combat dummy for your raid builds, going in and out of melee will teach you about flanking, avoiding its frontal attacks and keeping an eye out for lethal “fire” on the ground to avoid.
---
T6 trophies are another bottleneck. You will need some way of obtaining them, be it through laurel exchanges, volatile magic or straight up gold and TP. Figure out a way and keep accumulating them over time. Any means of earning gold will move you further ahead in progress here.
---
Raid builds - a lot can be done offline and out of game in terms of knowledge building and decisions. Pick a build, read up and learn about it, then move in-game to gear, practice and develop muscle memory. Hunt around for training guilds and discords. Read up/watch videos to familiarize with specific boss mechanics.
---
Basically, switch into some raid builds asap, and develop your comfort level and proficiency with them while getting all the open world stuff you need done anyway. Then concurrently keep an eye out for opportunities to do single raid encounters and develop a network in preparation for when you have more time.
---
My engineer got a new ability on f5.  Something about revealing stealth mobs.   Seems mostly utterly useless, and I don't see where I can change it to anything useful.
---
You need to learn to read before you make a reddit post highlighting how stupid you are!.
---
To be honest, most of the time people pressing 1 get hard carried everywhere in higher level fractals T4 etc and even open world.
---
I'm so glad that Scrappers have a voice in the community.  These changes were BS, I really hope at least some of them (cough cough Antitoxin) get reversed.
---
[Power DPS Soulbeast](https://discretize.eu/builds/ranger/power-soulbeast) is a meta fractal pick since it has good burst on its own and can provide Frost spirit and one wolf pack for more group DPS. Do note that the build does change for raids though so you’d want to focus it on one or the other. Also GW2 is great for playing alts, it’s nice to have options in builds and play styles.
---
Power DPS is in a good spot, it’s not the highest but the burst is really good and the group DPS it provides sets it apart from a lot of other options. For condition DPS the build is really easy to play well and works on a lot of raid bosses though you won’t want it in fractals. Healing Druid has fallen out of favor in fractals (if you need a healer FB or Ren are better choices), but is meta on almost every raid.
---
Take a look at that build guide and if you do decide to give raids a shot (check out a training discord) you can start working on the legendary armor collection which gives a full ascended set then another full set of precursors.
---
Sure, and the scourges got deleted from pve entirely.
---
Funnily enough scourges got a huge buff in wvw and are still acceptable in spvp.
---
Shame you missed that though.
---
Of all the changes, you wanted antitoxin runes to remain as a +1 cleanse? Really?
---
Are you trying to use logic in GW2 Reddit, to argue with people whining about a nerf to their favoured class/espec? Nice joke, buddy.
---
GW2 Reddit is a platform where you come to complain about something that you dislike, in an attempt to try find more like-minded people who share your opinion. Go learn the unwritten rules, friend.
---
And they really hard to report sine they tend to teleport underground below the node, making it nearly impossible to target them to report. 
---
You can use the /report command follower by a character name, and even if we could, then they would just use exotic characters like àèoïü that not everyone can input in their keyboards.
---
Not really, no.
---
My point is that the system should be designed for people with many builds, not just a few.
---
For me I play one character 90% of the time and am one of the "they" people you're talking about.  Here are my builds:  
---
-Viper Condi Ren (Open World) 
---
-Diviner's Power Renegade (Raids/Fractals) 
---
-Viper Ren DPS (Raids) 
---
-Berserker Herald DPS (Raids/Fractals)
---
-Handkiter Herald (Raids)
---
-Healing Ren/Herald (Raid/Fractals)
---
-Healing Tank Ren/Herald (Raids/Fractals)
---
-Marauder/Berserker Hammer Herald Roaming (WvW) 
---
-Condi (mixed stats) Herald Roaming (WvW) 
---
Soooo that's 9.  All of the ones listed above have different Rune/Sigil/Stat/Weapon variations even if 2 or 3 of them are similar-ish.  Some of them could be split even further, like the "Healing Ren/Herald" ones.  Also worth noting I typically use anywhere between 3-5 of these builds during many of my play sessions 
---
I'm glad for you that this system works well for you, but for anyone in my position (which is a fair amount of dedicated/Veteran players) then the system just doesn't work as well as what we already had.  So don't tell us we're wrong to think what we think or what we need when a lot of us that have been advocating for this system in the first place NEVER envisioned it with such limits as it directly hurts the viability of the system for those that need it the most
---
Dho I was downvoted coz people assumed there was no expansion for 25e, so I quoted steam reviews ;)
---
There's no way to reason with trolls / white knights
---
If its buy to play more people will be hesitant to put their account on the line by botting.
---
I'm not opposed to playing in melee range, but from a class fantasy standpoint I'm a bigger fan of bows, spellcasters, and guns than swords and other melee weapons
---
Thank you for sharing this.
---
If you are trying to bring back Scrapper, can you resurrect Ranger old Bark skin trait.
---
Sure, first they got my gems for all the inventory slots for multiple equip, now I have to buy template slots  for using half of those.
---
So, what's that shoulder piece?
---
Nope.
---
Well there's one born every minute.
---
Its less clunky than the shit they are introducing lol
---
There are couple of extra lines if you are Bless by Balthazar or Kormir, but nope.
---
&gt;  Do you not have thieves on the enemy team? 
---
\*sigh\* another person who probably barely plays pvp, trying to talk about what's useful in high level pvp.
---
In theory, sure, you can destealth thiefs. In practice, it'll pretty much never happen or be relevant.
---
As a scrapper you'll be doing 1 of 2 things:
---
1.  you'll be taking part in team fights for the aoe condi-cleanse you provide to your team.
---
2. you'll be bunkering at a point alone
---
For point 1) the thief will (or should) never be taking part in the big team fights at mid, meaning you'll never be able to de-stealth them when it matters.
---
For point 2) if you run into the thief while solo bunkering, de-stealthing them means absolutely nothing, since you won't have the movement utility to keep up with them in the first place, and you have no range options, meaning you stand on point and try to survive. The thief being stealthed or revealed makes no difference here either.
---
&gt;  Or engineers using toss elixir to stealth the whole team on the opening fight? 
---
This never happens in high ranks. It's mostly a useless gimmick people in silver or something do. It's a completely useless strategy.
---
&gt;  Use your brain, man. The idea that detection pulse is only useful in WvW is idiotic. 
---
Lets say it has minuscule viability in pvp... How does that change the fact that Chemical Field is still **much** better?
---
&gt; I don't think many players will quit for build templates, because there is so much other future content. LS5, WvW restruct, raids, fractals, PvP maps, new maps, maybe expansion etc. 
---
Ah yes, all these things (aside from LW5) are coming in the next 12 months for the last 24 months.
---
Sounds good to me! I assume with T3 fracts and only having exotic armor all your accessories would need to have 9 AR? Most of mine have 7s and 8s.
---
&gt; Are you trying to use logic in Reddit, to argue with people whining about a nerf to their favoured class/espec? Nice joke, buddy. 
---
Logic? What logic?
---
Nothing he said actually applies to pvp.
---
You actually expect them to outright state anything? Haven't been dealing with big corporations much 'ave ya?
---

huh, well maybe pvp players shouldn't be standing around the giant glowing screaming sand pillar.  doesn't seem overly strong to me, just sounds like it forces players to pay attention
---
Pure D/D is often better because it can move lol

I went from 400-500 just creating back pieces, was quite cheap as well.  Never completed the gourmet achievement stuff, never discovered anything.
---
Houndskin Mantle, reward from Flash Point/Draconis Mon.
---
You start getting the ascended seed drops past a point in the Sylvari line of the quest, and the drops of quality red meat past a point in the Charr quest line. You don’t have to complete the entire gourmet achievement for those.
---
You should delete this post a soon as possible. You're really making yourself look stupid.
---
I wonder who these people are that buy all the grow lamps are there that many people still building mawdrey?
---
Charge is the best race in all of GM5
---
Do Choking Ass instead
---
The fact you're this salty about a skill that was literally just " create a poison field " is mind blowing to me.
---
Seriously, get over it.
---
Thanks for the heads up ! Edited post
---
Oh, sweet summer child, power reaper and revenant in instanced PvE have had "voice" for nearly 2 xpacs and nothing has changed.
---
Keep dreaming these developers give a damn. There's a reason this game doesn't have a PTR where changes are pending and iterated based on player feedback, and it's because Anet's developer culture acts like they know best.
---
Hell, with PoF they didn't even do the 2 week beta weekends per class iteration that they did in HoT before release.
---
I mean I'm sure there's some, but it's for the Skyscale too
---
Gotcha that makes total sense. Are people running power on it still?
---
&gt;No video game ever made does relationships in a non-cringy, cliched way so try to deal with it.
---
TBH Kass and Marjory are a special kind of "in your face" relationship. Their WHOLE character after LS1 is just being a couple, that's it.
---
Thank you. You are right though, my post could be interpreted in too may different ways. I've never played a JRPG so I don't really know what you mean other than taking it literally, but I'm glad I'm not alone in my convictions about what makes game play fun and engaging.
---
-Fang Fairy
---
the core necro fear spammer is the same in terms of effectiveness now, its the fallback essentially
---
Nah. They're fine.
---
But big mean ANet took away a useless skill that literally everyone thought was a flavorless piece of crap and I \*LOVED\* it! Why couldn't they have done what \*I\* wanted?! If they did it \*my\* way then everything would be perfect for when \*I\* play Scrapper. Clearly they just hate Scrappers! There's \*no\* builds for Scrapper that are enjoyable to play now that my happy little fart cloud got removed! ANet's the WURST!
---
Firebrigade is meta in CM fractals, I can't remember the last time I had a chrono or druid in my group.
---
Firebrigade is becoming increasingly popular over dual chrono in raids, although chrono is still the meta tank.
---
Well as the GM said in their response....slow down placing your orders I guess
---
[removed]
---
Do you always have the win the matches?
---
Look at this game at the bright side. The clicking wars from mythic toilet, the bags, deleting unsoldable stuff, your current/future girlfriend/wife will appreciate your highly clicking skill.
---
The main reason season 2 is trash is because you don't know the people.  Luckily the people stay the same in POF, season 3, and season 4.   
---
It gets better
---
The sylvari were kind of unique in HoT. It's not like Balthazar has some psychic connection to humans or something. With that said, the stories in PoF are almost exclusively human stories. We don't see much about what Charr or Norn etc. are up to. The stories focus on the campaign against Balthazar and then Season 4 tackles more human stuff and then we get cosmic.
---
The seasons are very different. Yes it is extremely cringe in ls2. My favourite is the heart of thorns story. Trust me it gets better.
---
This is what you get when design is based on profit rather than usability.
---
The [endless miniature tonic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Miniature_Tonic) is one of the best thing ever made in the game.
---
Does this affect heal scourge in anyway?
---
Does this also add in doing tournaments?
---
future pvper?
---
He’s not attacking them because they’re lesbian. It really was cringey to listen to them. If it was a man and a woman it’d be equally as bad.
---
Yeah I mean look at how unused Chrono is after the changes on the previous patch. Oh, wait..
---
That's certainly the case with me. Not that there's nothing to enjoy, but I am now seriously considering quitting Guildwars2. Because it just. Doesn't. Stop.
---
And in this specific case it's not even about the templates themselves but the attitude towards design that it displays (which I've remarked on in a seperate comment). Substandard, pre-compromised design is not something I want to endorse.
---
You haven't proven what most people have because you need the actual numbers from Anet to do so.  You want to exclude normal distribution while also claiming to use all data.  That isn't semantics, that's just you taking a guess and then cherry picking and tricking yourself with confirmation bias.  You haven't provided logic, only rationalizations.
---
God you mongrel races really do need to be cleansed.
---
Will the dps counter side of it still stay though?
---
yea should still be updated
---
I mean they nerfed Guardian sceptre AND Staff lol. Literally NOTHING is off the table
---
False positives happen.
---
The issue was that they were insanely confident that it was flawless and refused appeals.
---
That's a good idea! Not sure if it will work for the metal bits I'm talking about, since they're not a single color.
---
While it's fun as hell to play, PvP has a number of problems that prevent new players from fully enjoying it. 
---
Firstly, it's got an unnecessarily high skill floor if you approach it like you would other games, and this can turn off some players. While some builds are easy to play, you have to learn the dangers of every other class and elite spec. As well as how to rotate and what each map's mechanics are (and how to prioritize them over teamfights and rotating). It's quite prohibitive, and the tutorials are absolutely awful. A new player can easily feel lost and just give up.
---
Secondly, the community here keeps scaring away new players because of the fear of toxicity. Even though it is obvious that the PvP component of the game will always be more toxic than the PvE counterparts, as it is with every game in existence. In my experience, the toxicity is greatly overstated. Though it is certainly higher than it should be, which I attribute to Anet's failings.
---
This part is more of a rant but: ultimately, Anet truly shot itself in the foot with PvP when they stubbornly strove for an "e-sports first" approach in the beginning rather than a "fun first" approach. And I believe this decision has led to the stagnation and unnecessary complexity we see today, which in turn paved the way for a community that is more toxic than it needs to be. 
---
I definitely encourage players to try PvP, make avid use of the mute button when you need to, and just do your best to have fun. Winning or losing does not matter, even in ranked, as with the current issues in GW2 PvP you cannot rationally take it seriously. All that matters is that you have fun and do the best you can.
---
so it takes  7 years to make same thing as you did before? k
---
Oh, right, because the material in that part of the armor alters how a color looks.
---
Thanks for the detailed explanation!
---
And not just that, but multiple template slots across all your characters!
---
Mesmer does a lot more than just tank. Don't know where you're getting your info but since you only really play open world you have a whole lot more options as to what and how you build. You only really need to worry about specific roles/builds when you get into game modes like WvW, Fractals, Raids, or a bit of sPvP.
---
By no means the be-all-end-all list, but here's a good place to get you started for builds: [metabattle open world](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World)
---
Most times I find Tempest to be comfy in open world, though if you're going to be staff I think Weaver is a bit better for tagging and such.
---
In those cases I try to eyeball what I think the most common color is, and jab that pixel with my color picker. Or take a sample of two and average the RGB values of each
---
this build looks great too
---
GW1 stored all the templates locally. It seems they decided to store it in a database as an arbitrary limitation and method of monitization, where even monitized you do not get unlimited like you did before.
---
I agree that the overall implementation of templates would fundamentally be different between games, but I see no reason why some of the basic features that would translate between games wouldn't be present.
---
Mai Trin will be a lot less about being a Fractal God and more about knowing a decent DPS rotation. The fight is simple so once you have it figured out it's just a matter of your team being buffed and doing damage.
---
Mai Trin came out prior to ANet started Raids or the newer line of fractals (arguably Mai Trin was an early attempt at such fractals). So the mechanics are easier and more forgiving.
---
Also since it's Fractal 42 you only need 47 agony resistance, which is hardly any at all. Even if you buy it all off the TP it's only ~35-40g worth of agony resistance. And you'll make that back in no time at all if you do any proper fractal farm (even if you're not doing Mai Trin, other fractal related farms will reward you pretty well).
---
From a group content standpoint, longbow ranger is useless, rifle deadeye is very strong but only on encounters that never require it to move and only in organized groups (so only Mursaat Overseer and Qadim2 with a good group), and staff ele used to be quite good for large hit boxes but it was carried by meteor showers insane damage and when the rng on it got gutted the damage fell off hard compared to sword/dagger.
---
Also anything you play ranged in group content has to be played in melee anyways, even if the weapons are ranged, otherwise you get no buffs or heals.
---
&gt; Every time it benefits someone it’s an equally shitty experience on the other end (if they notice).
---
Maybe the balance team also works on the TP.
---
Probably not for you. As others have said other characters get worse than M&amp;K. Anet's writing tends to be poor especially dialogue.
---
Wait, you have a different story in HoT as namekian? I only know the first part whispers are clear and visible to them, but i never knew the rest are different too.
---
No, the worst part is being a bystander when people use 50+ tomes of knowledge in the bank.
---
swapping builds is pretty much an absolute necessity in end game content considering the player count limit in instances and anet's "no holy trinity" philosophy.
---
I am so sorry bro why did you delete?
---
Wouldn't be more ideal to do less damage, or at least not as much.. you don't want to be that guy that kills stuff instantly and other people don't get to tag them.
---
Same story with whispers and different dialogues. Playing through HoT as sylvari is a special bonding experience with Canach.
---
Oh my fucking god, warframe's loadouts are exactly the same. If you load your xyz loadout/template, and then you modify your current equipment (not the template) to be abc, the next time you load it, it will be abc.
---
That's the complete opposite of how it should behave and pretty much guarantees I'll never use it.
---
I don't understand, guild wars 1 already solved this problem, why isn't it *literally exactly the same and available from day 1?*
---
Hmm... Around 3 hrs? Probably even less if I was actually focused the whole time
---
Bruh, its got an inbuilt anticheat now and its got a price entry, no longer the botfest you claim it to be.
---
I play mostly for story and I'll tell you that ls2 is the worst of what devs committed.
---
Firebrand and renegade are very good supports, fb moreso
---
You just robbed some poor kid's tooth fairy money out from under his own bed!
---
Yeah, for you, lmao.
---
i wasted time out of your day. pretty successful to me. unless the time lost meant nothing, in which case that’s just sad :/
---
I'm just waiting for wvw to be profitable.. :(
---
They're secretly all the same character cosplaying other people.
---
Oh nice a guy that makes a difference between build quality when pressing just 1 calls me cringeworthy. Good joke, Charlie
---
I still remember when the Silverwastes was added.  I tend to rotate through my characters, and at the time I was on my Warrior.  She's a giant Charr.  I ended up taking her through not only the JP, but also to get all those golden badges.  Would not recommend repeating that.
---
But the applied force trait has a cooldown of 10 seconds between.  What do you use between that?
---
Yes, but with max quickness duration that gives you 60% of your quickness uptime. You then supplement that quickness with the quickness Potion and the sigil of rage to get (close to if not) perma quickness
---
Edit: essentially what I'm suggesting is a way to swap using juggernaut and flamethrower (which is more passive) for  a swap from alchemy to explosives and grenades (which is more active) to generate that quickness from applied force.
---
Looks a but closer to the old Alacrity effect to me; I haven't paid attention to it but I could definitely see them toning down the purple in this direction.
---
Thanks for the load of info, will make the game a lot easier. As for the server, sadly I am EU.
---
The last instance of the personal story put me to sleep while playing...
---
Yes and no. If I take the Source Engine and create a game, it's a modified version of the Source Engine. If I use Unity and make a game, it's a modified version of the Unity Engine.
---
The GW1:Prophecies engine is a "different" engine than the GW1:Factions engine. Simply having an additional skill alters the engine (in most cases) as you have to include new code to evaluate and process it (unless you've done a bang on job of modulating skills and effects, but even then when you add a new effect...).
---
So yes, it's "not the same". However, the base was the GW1 engine and then they took what they could use and trashed some stuff they didn't want to/couldn't. The main factor in reference to performance is DX9, which is a limitation of it (the engine) originating from 2002 with the first game (Prophecies) released in 2005. The engine has had additions, but not overhauls.
---
The completely different inner workings portion is mostly no but slightly yes. Yes, there are new workings in reference to new mechanics that have been implemented (example: jumping), however on the inner inner workings, it is the same (example: dx9). Additionally, a lot of the limitations in what can be done (easily) is usually something that wasn't possible in GW1. For example, forced upward mobility was something that had to be done jankly (SAB original release, source in one of the reasons why they didn't bring it back [but they did bring it back]) but was eventually "fixed" after being worked on multiple times (Not So Secret zip pads, Bounce mushrooms in HoT).
---
If any other major system addition is to go by, no, it will not be improved over time. It will be entirely abandoned the moment it hits the live servers. Remember guild halls?
---
&gt;  because there is so much other future content.
---
Oh boi can't wait for that swiss and alliances that'll do nothing fro the gamemodes and will be released in maybe 2 years if ever
---
X
---
So you're saying don't run flamethrower at all.  Also is perma just meaning during door fights, or the entire time?
---
It had a built in anticheat to begin with. It just doesn't work very well. Like at all.
---
Got source on that metrica province ban?
---
It's not, at all, lol. It's the same, since you and your shade couldn't damage the same target anyway. They killed that interaction 2 years ago.
---
That's what I thought..
---
Oh, I could use https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chocolate_Omnomberry_Cream  for food.  Gives me that 40% MF and 100 concentration.  Also OP's build is lacking in crit chance.  Just the other problem is utility consumable.  Have to stick with something that gives MF.  The more MF = more bags.
---
I guess with High Caliber and Hematic Focus that's another 25% crit chance.
---
Just trying to figure out a way to reach over 50% crit chance and still use both flamethrower and grenades as well as get 100% boon duration without needing to rely on utility consumable to do so.
---
I'd recommend you watch a LW S1 recap, and then dive into S2. I thought the personal story was okay, and did everything that I could "in order." My general feeling has been that the story quality has generally been on an upward incline. S2 is good, but lacks voice acting at times. HoT is all voice acted, and generally good if rushed and a little sudden at the end. S3, I thought, was also good. PoF, great! Even if I did feel like it kind of rushed into its ending, even if nowhere near as much as HoT. I'm just about to start S4, so can't say much there, yet. But I hear it's good.
---
Strange enough but for the Mordrem illusions Kasmeer spawns in Grothmar the stealth detection mastery doesn't seem to work
---
It gets better as they move away from the pretence of "lovable characters form your favorite tv show", and go back into ingame lore as a source of drama.  
---
LWS2 is where they started experimenting with this, so it's pretty cringy at times.  
---
Then you have HoT where it's still a bit like this when they try to bring back the characters from the personal story (the group called Destiny's Edge), but ultimately the expansion story is short enough and serves the purpose of setting up what will happen next.  
---
Then you get LWS3, where they tried to develop the world map, and by doing so had to explore various plot points of the original GW2 story, and that's when it starts getting better, still some of the cringy characters make a comeback, but the story doesn't focus on them so much.  
---
Next comes PoF where they almost completely abandon them as focus points on the story and instead they focus on the major events ocurring on the world, including big characters of the lore. The cringe factor at this point is condenced on a single entity that will follow you around, thankfully almost uncapable of dialogue.  
---
Then comes LWS4 with great plot points at times, some not so great, at this point the most cringy characters are absent, but you still have this entity following you. By the end of the season, the entity will ascend into a world shaping element, and the cringe will be condenced in aspects of nature such as rainbow colors and shiny elements of the terrain.  
---
We are now at the start of LWS5, the entity makes a swift appearance but then it's gone, and we get to explore old lore, and the more war-like conflicts that characterize the original setting of the game.  
---
The world making is pretty good in this game, I try to focus on that and tolerate most sidekicks thrown in my way. I like the character named Canach though, and to some extent Rytlock (the game's mascot).
---
that was one thing that surprised me, it seems like a no brainer to get rid of employees who have no idea what they're doing
---
i wouldn't give them any credit for "admitting" their mistake - they were pretty much forced to once they were publicly shamed for their incompetence. they were more sorry that they got caught rather than because it happened, they never like admitting they are in the wrong.
---
The thing that hurt ls2 the most is being unable to replay ls1.
---
You start it and you have *no clue* who any of these people your character spent a literal year building relationships with are, because you as a player can never see that again.
---
However, once you get past that hurdle, it only gets better from here on out.
---
Ls2 is better than personal story, HoT is better than ls2 and so on.
---
Just keep going is my advice, it only gets better from here.
---
no, they do not get better. i completely agree with you, i've never been able to get into the story of gw2 aside from the first few racial stories (up to level 30 ?), it's a poorly written mess.
---
it's slightly better than playing as other races but not really.
---
Better give them feedback about guild wars 3 and 4 now.. we dont want them to make a mistake dont we ? -.-"
---
Chemical Field wasn't useless, Dectection Pulse isn't useless.  
---
Both skills are pretty irrelevant in PvE, both skills are relevant in competitive gamemodes.  
---
Which one is more useful? It's hard to say, Stealth meta on wvw was getting out of hand, it's always nice to have a reveal on sPvP, but even then, it's a very stituational skill, while having a shitty poison pulsing field, while shitty, it's still less situational.  
---
If anything, I would be complaining about why the slot is filled with such garbage, and not about which garbage I prefer or want back.  
---
My take? I would love a throwable skill, that throws a poison pulsing field that reveals enemies that pass through it, that way you get your shitty poison field back, but now you can throw it, and you can reveal people where you think they are when invisible, or at least serve a similar purpose as how we use necro marks on wvw for this.

Some more info on different tools: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1stw9RIOjS2ENOelHPhp494ne90e2G3xQNUUfmQ6mXBs/edit#gid=1489005975
---
Would be nice to see all gathering tools tested and on a chart like that.
---
its worse when you fight bosses that just wont stop moving, then for large chunks of time you either do no dps, or do no support
---
Yup. I usually stack up all sorts of karma boosts on a less used character, do a few jp, bells, orphan run and log out so i dont waste the boosters time till next day :)
---
The guy I'm responding to proposes to allow him to maintain his templates further.
---
Oh boy
---
That's my main concern about the latest patches. Numbers and minor tweaks are one thing, but changing and gutting fluid enjoyable mechanics to which you got used over the years is, at minimum, extremely frustrating.
---
Put together something that might work.  99.47 boon duration.  Uses explosives traitline instead of alchemy.  Also includes rocket boots as a quick way to get around (yes I know you can mount up but sometimes you need to just clear immob and get away while in combat).  I also didn't include a utility food so someone can use magic find food if they choose.  Also removed sigil of concentration for sigil of speed (since the previous food gave swiftness on kill).  Perma fury from no scope with 8 second duration, and 8 second trait recast.  Crit chance displays as 43.24, but you include 20% from fury then 10% from Hematic Focus, and 15% from High Caliber.  Comes out to be 88.24% crit chance.  
---
The only downfall is swapping between grenade and flamethrower kit between roaming and doing doors (if grenade seems to be better tagging at doors, you could just stick with that entirely).

Tank chrono, support chrono, dps chrono, scepter tank chrono for largos, condi mirage, pvp build, wvw build
---
Without trinkets I assume is for the damage reduction to give other people the chance for tagging aswell?
---
but the question is how it is holding up against the god of tagging, mirage gs build?
---
It might be a silly comparison, but your approach is the reason why we have so many divorces. Why would you want to fix something you've spent thousands of hours on, just move on and stop crying.
---
And, well, a few gameplay suprises here and there at point. I highly reccomend bringing a friend to the final boss fight, while the sylvari starts the story. You'd be suprised how far they were willing to take some of the HoT shennenigans.
---
If they ask you to give over your account name and the exploiting you did, and you do it....

*insert pikachu face meme*

You are confusing actual engine code and scripting code. True, scripting code is part of the engine, but it's independent for each game using the engine. You should be able to update the engine without affecting the scripting code. A skill has a lot of stuff assigned to it. Such as icons, descriptions, but also scripting. To me that's not the engine. Think of a game engine as a library with helper functions that you can use, but not necessarily change (unless you know what you're doing).
---
We know ANET has not software engineers as game designers. The first work on engine code and some scripting, while the latter almost exclusively works on scripting while using engine helper functions.
---
More like 12 bro. They started developing GW2 in 2007.
---
Shortbow Daredevil and Greatsword Mirage have the biggest tag potential
---
But whats the point?
---
&gt; This one was long overdue, smölhart is a necromancer now so this is all old news really.
---
Why are you doing this to yourself?
---
Maybe /u/BackIsBachus or someone else could help out, might be worth asking in this thread if anyone can get you a mount on EU once you have the expansion.
---
Sb daredevil, flamethrower scrapper, gs mirage work great. But even something like staff druid or firebrand with tome 1 spam can work.
---
This is a very egoistic build and the whole map will hate you. Why not just farm with raptor?
---
&gt; doing game development without some sort of version control system seems insane. 
---
Hah, you are giving me flash backs to the good old days of the NGE in Star Wars Galaxies. They manage to make half their players quit overnight, yet said they had no backups or other way to rollback the game to before the NGE. Took that poor game about 2 years to reach a state that was fun to play again. Then they wen't and shut down the servers:(
---
And in the end it all comes not to coding, but to actual management of production.
---
So no-expansion Mike have been managing project for several years. Enough to change a lot. So when you have old game with huge tech debt that need to make money for years to come what you do? Develop tools, invest into player retention, implement cheap monetization.
---
And they developed tools for mounts and cheap system to monetize them. Everything else is GTFO. So I would not say that they are buy any stretch are incapable, they just decided not to invest in player retention and any other tools to make more content. They are downscaling instead, buy slowing down raids, fractals, PvP and WvW updates.
---
PvP is way more repetitive than PvE. There are only a handful of maps and it's all just standing in circles and attacking people.
---
I ended up burning out from endless multi-mapping and eventually quit the game. Between being spoiled by AB and Istan, I just can't bring myself to 'like' farming SW.
---
Classic ArenaNet right there: trick new players to play the game with promises of everything being free, then the player has to buy the season episodes and they also suck big time, with a sudden shift in tone (from serious to sitcom) and new characters that the game doesn't even bother to introduce. 
---
The new characters are, in short, 
---
* Taimi: the new main character, the player is her dumb bodyguard. Her traits in LS2 are loving Scarlet (the watered down Harley Quinn that plagued LS1) and having anime cancer. She later drops the Scarlet worship and becomes the cheery teen with teen speak.
---
* Kasjory: an amalgamated entity composed of two non-characters that can't seem to exist without one another. Marjory is a world-renowned detective that was supposed to solve a murder case, sent the player on a fetch quest and then dropped the "detective" thing in favour of being the "horny lesbian girlfriend". Kasmeer the Hedgehog comes straight out of Deviantart: she's noble but her dad lost money causing her family to fall in disgrace, she likes Marjory, glitter and gods, she dislikes icky things like dead people, she has the superpower of detecting lies and she hiccups when she's upset. She'll also get a whole expansion without Marjory to solidify her character, you can guess how it's going to go.
---
* Braham: look at his face. He's supposed to be 15. Top tier modelling right there! He's an angry teenager. He's Eir's offspring, right now (LS2) he's still pissed at her for choosing career over family. He doesn't have much of a personality to speak of beyond "reacts with anger to sudden events".
---
* Rox: someone thought a giant cat with anime eyes would be a good idea. Like everyone else she's defined by two traits: she's a gladium (a charr without a warband, so a "dishonourable" status) and she spits at random times. The spitting part was later removed because it probably didn't make her endearing. The writers have no idea what to do with her so she's almost always following Braham. 
---
* Canach: this one is actually decent. Got cheated by the Consortium (NPC version of NCSoft) and went on the run until the player character caught him. Got freed by Anise (female human mesmer #1255283) to be her bodyguard, which he isn't too happy about. He's snarky and hates everyone.
---
Since you're starting with LS2 let me warn you that you're not getting rid of them anytime soon. You'll see Destiny's Edge again at times but these clowns are your party now, with one exception that I'm not going to spoil. 
---
Also I hope you didn't like Eir or Zojja since you're not going to see either of them for a long time after Heart of Thorns, the first expansion.
---
ah, ok. I already got legendary armor from wvw and i dont raid so i was a bit miffed that i lost 150 provisioner tokens on those gifts of craftsmanship
---
More importantly, 650 games this season at ~15 minutes each (game time + wait time + active build tweaks) means an average of almost 3.5h a day of just PvP, each and every day for three months.
---
I wish i had an average 3.5h a day to play a game, yet alone just one mode of a huge MMO. I used to have that much of spare time, but back then gold wasn't coming out of every hole in this game, and PvP operated a whole lot differently.
---
Try out core necro :)
---
Use nvidia geforce experience overlay instead, it makes the game as pretty as reshade does without the need of regular updates
---
Can also check out the [wiki's armor gallery](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charr_male_medium_armor)
---
You answered it yourself - trait resets weren't always free. By the time they were, the game was in a live environment and build templates are now competing with live demands. After the redid how trait resets worked, they were working on elite specs.
---
It's the same discussion when it comes to "brining back" Season 1 - do we get more new content or do they dedicate resources to bringing back old content. Nothing is free, everything comes at a cost and ArenaNet can't do it all.
---
Personally I don't think GW2 needed build templates until maybe around the time HoT came out (build diversity in PvE really blew up then). Before HoT we had only one stat being used in PvE (berserker) and most professions weren't being in used in PvE, let alone builds.
---
Even after HoT, the meta favoured a narrow range of builds and professions (the most diverse professions were mesmer, ranger and maybe warrior), so the big desire for build templates really didn't kick into gear until PoF brought a second set of elite specs (which is also around the time that ArenaNet began working on build templates afaik).
---
Build templates didn't make sense in 2012 because of the system, but they also weren't needed.
---
How poor are people? A few gold is not worth all that time.
---
Both "romantic plots" are equally stupid, clumsily written, and the game would be better off without them.
---
That's the point - he wasn't. There is some constructive discussion occurring around build templates, but it is swamped in a flood of bad faith arguments and salty people looking to pick a fight with ArenaNet.
---
A small but vocal part of the community have turned in to malcontent trolls with no genuine interest in the game doing well anymore and they only hang around to spread misery and stirr up as much drama because they personally don't enjoy the game anymore, so why should anyone else?
---
I truly wish these people would go place something else (surprised pikachu /s) because no-one wins while they hang around like miserable ghosts wiping shit on the walls so everyone else suffers.
---
Your use of the word buy instead of by makes me think you are trying to sell me something.
---
WvW person here, Power is the way to go on Scourge still yes.
---
tl;dr on how this patch affected Scourge (the buff): Now Scourge can hit 10 people no matter distance. Previously if two groups held each other at range, Scourge was limited to 5 targets. So at range, Scourge just does shittons more damage/strips by doubling it's target cap. In melee, Scourge can now place it's bomb with more agility, since the entire skill can be pbaoe, rather than half pbaoe. Making the class in melee easier to hit with it's entire bomb, and removing f1 cast time from the necessary skill rotation to bomb in melee as well. The nerf to Scepter wasn't near enough to outweigh the crazy versatility buff shades got, so this patch Scourge is just straight better.
---
On necro in wvw overall: Sand Savant Scourge , with Soul Reaping 112 and Curses 223, Scepter/Dagger, is \*\*the\*\* best damage slot class, giving insane burst, good sustained damage, good strips, great barrier. Because it can do all of these things so effectively, all at the same time, Sand Savant Scourge alongside Minstrel Firebrand, define WvW. Those two classes are what WvW revolves around, and has revolved around since the specs launched with PoF. All other class viability and builds, are reactions or cascade effects to what plays around these specific class specs. So when you see the mode beg and plead to Anet to nerf Scourge, this is why. We've been meta-locked by FB and Scourge for two years. While Thief/Ranger are eternally just out of meta (ranger had a cameo a while back in HoT but was removed from the mode quickly), this still leaves another five classes bent to the will of two. It's not a \*horrible\* meta, but it's really one-dimensional since combat burns so fast. Support FB is also generally considered \*real boring\* but is required 1 in every 5.
---
A lot of the upper end NA guilds disbanding and leaving to other games. A \*lot\* of the better ones have simply gotten their fill of PoF and are tired of where the game mode is, going dormant as a result. Which has rippled out, as other guilds now have less to fight as more guilds quit. Patch cycles like this, where we're in for a cycle of Scourge being \*even better\*, doesn't help much.
---
I got a bit of enjoyment out of downvoting another one of this useless twit's comments again. I suppose that value is relative, though...
---
the commander looks like he belongs with the ash legion
---
&gt;There's a reason this game doesn't have a PTR where changes are pending and iterated based on player feedback, and it's because Anet's developer culture acts like they know best.
---
Honestly, I assumed it was because splitting the already comparatively small population across two different universes would be an awful idea that contradicts what the megaserver and, in the vague future, the WvW restructure wanted to do.
---
I'd recommend sc/wh fresh air tempest build (dont use conjured weapons until you're more familiar with the class). Most of the time you'll stay in air attunement and use others as quick burst, heal or aoe blind. Fairly simple once you get used to it, has good range, can be traited to have pretty good mobility in combat (superspeed in air) for extra defense and kiting poteltial, has quite a lot of aoe blinds as well as strong aoe pressure and lingering fields which make rallying extremely easy (especially if you have downed signet skill/mastery from ls3 episode 4).
---
That just highlights the problem IMO. Instead of constantly nerfing Chrono, maybe (just maybe) they could have taken a good long look at why certain buff/debuff systems work in other games, not necessarily even MMOs. "good, look" means anything above 2,24s in this case, mind.
---
Then they could have realized that instead of relying on their throw-everything-at-the-wall-see-what-sticks approach to class design, most games where boons and conditions balance out first defined a set of shared elements (GW2 has this, better than any other game in fact), add a few non-shared extras (GW2 also has this, usually trait-procced effects), and then afterwards designated classes to have roles under this system and each specific element can be brought by multiple classes in a fairly evenly-spread manner (GW2 fucks this up so badly it's not even funny any more).
---
I mean, you can even have specific buff classes, so long as they're mechanically limited from dominating the buff space (consider old world Shaman in WoW with their totems only affecting 1 party in a raid of 40 people, even then they were borderline problematic, for the truly broken version see Paladins though who spent 180 out of every 300 seconds casting single target buffs onto the raid).  
---
But instead ANet does what they always do, they just throw out some elements or changes and see whether they work out. Or not. They don't seem to care any more at that point.
---
But still to high
---
Nice, got a Dragon Age Inquisition feel to it!
---
Do you not understand what a joke is?
---
r/whoosh again, apparently.
---
hop to a map and just ask for ports till you get them all, tip good and ghen go train with metas
---
&gt; Anet doesnt give a shit about wvw and never will
---
Except to hilariously botch "balance" in the name of wvw
---
This is part of my "Skyscale Ascending Series". While many of my videos show getting up  the tallest towers and mountains, I figured I would also show how great the skyscale can be  in more of a horizontal flight pattern.
---
Correct. As more you tag without killing more ppl can tag the same objectives, as more objectives ppl can tag more loot for everyone, as more loot ppl get more they will stay in map, as more ppl stay in map more mobs from trash doors, as more mobs you can tag more more loot you get... easy
---
you've gotta be joking. you say it's 'just standing in circles and attacking people' well pve is 'just standing in corners attacking mobs' or 'just running at a boss with 50 people in an event map' then. at least the people in pvp change the attacks they use and the way they fight you much unlike pve mobs
---
&gt;But most likely, it'll evolve to not placing the shade at all and just AoE bomb you in melee with 10 target cap PBAoEs.
---
I'll take this over pirate ship meta any day though, even if it's going to still just be a straight downgrade vs two patches ago, right before the patch cycle we didn't have reveals for.

MF doesn’t affect them anymore. Most research show it’s slightly better to open, but as often it’s a matter of preference if you like the few extra gold enough to id all and recycle or if you’d rather just sell and get the cash. I personally open all mine and don’t buy on tp but I own the unlimited recycling tools.
---
&gt;you've gotta be joking. you say it's 'just standing in circles and attacking people' well pve is 'just standing in corners attacking mobs' or 'just running at a boss with 50 people in an event map' then. 
---
The difference being that PvP encounters take place over a much wider variety of environments, with different conditions on the outcome of the event, much different movesets available to the enemies, etc. There's just a whole lot more variety to be had from them.
---
Oh my god this.
---
I loved doing dragonstand, hitting SoI and watching everyone around me light up for a ridiculous amount of time.  I had forgotten about that, now I miss it even more.
---
Hmm I see a lot of pvp posts from you OP, good on you to promote the game mode. 
---
And for other people reading this, once you have hit 80, done many challenging stuff in pve, or just want more challenging game play. Try pvp. It is where you push builds to max (I don't claim it's the only thing to push your build). It gets toxic from time to time but just ignore and play more and learn.
---
By just collecting the Map Insights and doing the Metas I'll be able to max out all Masterys? o: It seems like that wont be enough..
---
identifying unid gear isnt influenced by magic find anymore, so the price you will get on the tp is actually a little less now than if you ID them yourself
---
Generally I wouldn't take hammer because it's not a great weapon at the moment but if you are you could go virtues and take the hammer trait. Zeal is great and you can take the scepter trait with the sword spirit weapon and the spirit weapon trait. Then potentially radiance dh or firebrand for the last one. Take this based on where you are at in terma of solo/group content. But firebrand is the best for all around content I think. I'd suggest having a look at the Wooden potatoes build if you have a chance he goes over general gearing for all classes and then also each class individually. Just search for wooden potatoes on YouTube then have a look through his build playlist.
---
I've been playing sword weaver for over a year now (well a bit before that, I have quit a while ago and recently came back again) in both open world and pvp and it's still my absolute favorite to go to in both modes. It doesn't seem they changed much since the last time I played, at least for pve. Was maining power mesmer and chrono before that for a very long time, ele was fun with it's complexity but it lacked that spice that that the mesmer had with all it's tricks, however that all changed with the weaver. This spec turned the class upside down in terms of how it's played, and I loved it.
---
It is the complete opposite of what you might have heared about elementalists having trouble surviving, this thing is a tank when played right. It's very fun to play, very mobile and deals good damage too. You can occasionally swap to ranged for group farming, but for real fights sword weaver is where it's at. There's several stun breakers, iframes and mobility skills at your disposal to get you out of any tough situation. 
---
You can use a bit of hybrid gear like Celestial to get that extra bit of survivability, it works quite well for this playstyle since it also provides a lot of heals and a good portion of your damage can also come from burning. Combine that with all the barrier generation, iframes and mobility, it makes this one of the best classes to get trough most of the game's challenges by yourself if you have to.  Allright - maybe other classes like necro are easier, but ele is just much less boring. And if you're concerned you won't be "optimal" for not using full zerker gear, always remember that a downed zerker build is less effective than someone that has never been downed.
---
I know you don't do pvp but just as an example to give you an idea of how survivable this class can really be; a common role for sword weavers in pvp, at least the one that I was playing was what we call bunker builds that can survive fighting outnumbered and we are basically there just to delay and hold advantage over a winning point, since we're sometimes almost impossible to kill and it's considered a waste of time trying to 1v1 a bunker ele, has to be at least 2v1 and it's so much fun wasting the enemy's time while your team secures the other points:) I got several rage hate pms for it:))
---
And this works in open world too, just a bit easier since enemies are a lot weaker:) Overall very reliable and a ton of fun to play. It is extremely interactive, the ranged caster gameplay doesn't even come close to how exciting the sword weaver can be. There is a learning curve, but totally worth it!
---
These days I just salvage greens and blues. Rares I open and then salvage. If you get a rare thats worth more or around 2 ectos you can sell it like that, usually staves/greatswords/swords.
---
Will do, thanks!
---
ye thats the one i meant
---
Are you talking about collecting the mastery points or the XP needed?
---
Bangar makes mention of it a few times in the intro and I think it came up again later but I can't remember 100%
---
And my entire point was "PvE content is less repetitive and boring."
---
For HoT you should also do HoT adventures and any achievements that grant mastery points. LWS3 also has a lot of mastery points and HoT metas are a great way to get mastery XP. For core tyria LWS2 and fractals can help out for mastery points. For PoF, you can get most of it through story and map mastery insights.
---
should've spoke. computer voice isn't nice to listen to.
---
Oh hey yeah.. that is fun! I think I've been using this website all wrong.
---
Since it's a giveaway it should be fine.
---
And you're still talking past the actual topic. And no, I'm implying nothing. It's just stupid to argue with T1 fractals and saying it's easy with a geared character (WTF? Of course it is. That's exactly what I said right before but with "low tier maps" - it's exactly the same). I just said that pressing only one key will bring you nowhere except you want to hang around for hours. Of course T1 fractals are freaking easy for the most people that have the gear and knowledge to do CM or even only T4 dailies. That's not the point - the point was that according to OP any PvE content can get played through via only hitting 1 key. But ask the guys around T1 fractals that just started with fractals what they think. Ask the guys around T3 if it's so easy and boooring as the OP said to do the same stuff over and over. Ask the guys below 100kp if they think mastering the shattered observatory is boring. Plus: Ask them if they only use one key. It's just an extremely stupid statement. Period. Without any heal or utility you would die in the most fights of LS-maps except you love very long fights with running away and dodging the hell out of your character. Not to mention that the most content - from hearts, to collections and so on - require far more than just "pressing one key". Yea you can leech your way through some party content in PvE, but that's dumb and stupid and without the most other people, that actually play their character, that wouldn't be possible. Your comments are completely lost, seriously. I don't know what you want to try or where you want to get with it but it's insanely funny to watch you struggle finding any valid argument for anything.
---
They used to make pve enemies go in stealth, there's a few dungeon bosses that can, some open world mobs like panthers and skelk, I think even a risen high priestess in one of Orr's metas could
---
But for some reason they no longer make pve enemies that can stealth
---
did not know that, guess I will be opening them all now
---
If you open them you have a chance to get items of a better rarity,  salvaging just gives you the mats you get for that rarity. If you open a green unid gear you can get a yellow item and then have the chance to get ectos.

They were heavily nerfed a few months ago. Open them and salvage with Copper Fed for blues, Runecrafter for greens, and Silver Fed/mystic salvage kit for yellows. If you don't have the runecrafter you can use the copper fed on greens. If you don't have the salvage tools use the equivalent ones from the NPC merchant.

Mirage tag 12 mobs every dodge with infinite dodges

that_shaman did it better
---
That's their answer to limited number of templates.
---
I dont get it either, they could have absolutely butchered the target cap in WvW only. The Necro player can hit just 1 target and so can every shade. With Sand savant the Necro can hit 2 and the shade hits 2 as well.
---
But nah, why do that when you can buff the class in WvW while deleting it from the other 2 gamemodes, including one that has a population 10+ times the size of WvW?
---
Gw1 pve is full of botters and thief (gold seller), gw1 pvp died in 2011 so BEWARE! BEWARE! BEWARE!
---
DO NOT GO BACK TO GW1
---
Besides gw2 is only a namesake sequel... we all figured out the 2 games have little to nothing in common once you actually play them (they don’t even keep the same story after so long..)
---
None of the same devs worked on them and they didn’t ever add the most requested features from gw1 into gw2 (like actual guilds at war.. you know the old guild wars is and was nothing, absolutely nothing like gw2)
---
We all await gw3 and hopefully a return to actually guilds a guilds... a return to the real days of dual classing and all weapons open for all classes.
---
In short we want a return of the brain game that was the “build wars”.
---
Gw2 is nothing like the spirit of gw1 and that’s why gw2 was never anything near as big deal.
---
Pray for gw3 but DO NOT go back to gw1.... it doesn’t exist as it did and you will only find scammers, bots, stolen, or for sale items (as in they use bots and sell the items for you to use on your titles).. they sell them for IRL currency and anet allows the botters to continue since that’s the only way the gw1 economy still function (otherwise long ago the in game items and currency would have dried up or died locked away on dead player accounts)
---
So sure get a free copy but don’t expect much because there aren’t any real players there anymore as compared to actual population of bots/thieves/scammers.
---
Take it from a guy who loved gw1 since factions and plays gw2 now (I still login my gw1 account but don’t play because it’s only bots you are standing with... nobody there is real anymore and if they are real... they are active botters because that’s the ONLY way things get done on gw1 now)
---
Go back and see for yourself... just don’t say an old gw1 player didn’t warn you.

and quickness shortbow deadeye
---
Do you really think game engines have anything to do with this? Your corelation is just ignorant.
---
ONE CHARR! ONE CHAAAAARR!!
---
I would say in all pug groups, you need a really good static for condi fb to be worse.
---
Even in phases that last a bit less than 4 secs condi qb can do close to 90k dps in skor p1.
---
Just play fa tempest with staff then?
---
I once had a team with 3 thiefs and the other two went like "I can do that too" and then we had 5 men thief team and a lot of fun! ;)
---
And you will have all map for you. I comand laby sometimes and if i see ppl runing so selfish builds stealing loot from all i disband and quit map
---
If it was locked, a lot of games would be decided already at that stage. Why? Because the matchmaking sometimes produces very unfair combs against each other.
---
I personally put each type in my safe bag so I dont accident salvage stack. 
---
Then between events I open blues and salvage using Copperfed.
---
And I open greens and yellow and salvage with runecrafters.
---
I dont know how profit efficient this is, but I like getting all the matts fir the various projects I have on the go!
---
I find the trick to manage full bags when opening from a few stacks is to open a few, salvage, dont deposit materials,  open rest of your bags so your  encumbered,  then deposit materials to free space, salvage, oown bags, rinse and repeat
---
and female has the same hair cut xD
---
this build isnt selfish at all and not for soloing
---
I'm not complaining about an achievement, I'm saying doing this achievement, where you have to kill 500 mobs that only spawn during an event left me feeling salty because just like lake doric loads of engineers are spamming turrets making it impossible for anyone else to tag the mobs before they die. 
---
Honestly I couldn't give a fuck what game mode you play; it doesn't make you a better player in anyones eyes because you only play pvp and wvw, you just sound like an autistic neckbeard.
---
&gt;I don't know whether it's the more stable income from the subscription-based setup, or whether it's Squeenix being such a long-established studio with shared experience teams that used to work on non-MMO game
---
 To touch briefly on this topic because I find it really fascinating and inspiring, the FFXIV team has been in a unique position of tasting true failure and bringing it back from the brink which seems to have humbled them, or at least the director, and keeps them working hard. 
---
  It is no understatement to say that if FFXIV failed FF as a series died with it(According to Yoshida himself). I must imagine that such a tough time for a team has had wide reaching effects on the way the stuff they produce.
---
Having an anti cheat means absolutely nothing when your devs responses to blatant exploit/dupe abuse is "no, this exploit/dupe doesn't actually exist, and no, we won't acknowledge the mountains of evidence, and no, we won't even bother to try reproduce the easily reproducable exploit to prove it."
---
OwO
---
I am not sure if they even buffed Sword, the 20% damage increase to Sword 3 was not added with the balance patch but it would be added by 'next release'.
---
holy f.
---
Salvage blue, open green if I still have inventory slot, always open yellow.
---
it's ironic that you get downvoted for the truth, especially considering the contents of the comment you replied to
---
Do you think removing a tiny bit of poison damage from Scrapper "killed" the class? That's a bit out of touch.
---
That's untrue. They were removed because a small handful said they ruined immersion wgen Marjory was stretching while talking about murder and intrigue during S2.
---
Please don't make up bullshit.
---
I have been away for almost 2 years now, what were the biggest changes to the game classes for pve and pvp? 
---
My mains I care about are Chrono, Weaver and Revenant, I also started playing a bit of Necro - Reaper pve, Scourge pvp, have a Guardian and Thief all professions unlocked too play those a little less (mostly fb support in pvp), but still interested in the changes. 
---
I was about to dive deep into Mirage, Renegade and Scourge before I quit, I just geared them up but after finishing a legendary weapon I really needed a break from the game. 
---
I also saw some people riding what seems to be a dragon. That is really cool. What's up with that? 
---
I haven't started S4 yet, never been to Istan, is it still a thing? 
---
Don't have a beetle yet, do I need one, still a pain to get? 
---
Is there a "shortcut" getting the dragon without having to rush/skip trough main story which I like to enjoy slowly?
---
I own all the LW episodes, I logged on for those at least.
---
I was hoping to see a comic from you with your commander having a good time bc metal legion!
---
Thank you very much for all of your efforts in promoting GW1, Georgia. It is by far my favorite community in any game I’ve ever played and I think so many people are missing out by not checking it out. The game is far from dead and it is very cool to see events like this being backed by ANet! Keep it up!
---
no thanks, atleast pve farming is not stressing me out like that one player on my team that goes afk after first time death or enemy with broken bullshit build which i can't counter, even playing the same broken bullshit build is not fun (looking at you mirage)  
---
idk how it is now but last time i tried playing pvp was 3 seasons ago, and i make enough gold for my needs by not going out of my comfort zone
---
🤘Whoooooo!!!!🤘
---
I would pick ele over anything because ele simply can do everything and be everything. For open world i would pick Temepest at any given point.
---
If you don't intend to play any instances such as fractals and raids then i would go with Marauder gear and berserker jewelry and Tempest. You get more hp but still have damage. Tempest have not only damage but also a lot of support and cc to break bars. 
---
In open world you can choose what ever weapon set you want so scepter or dagger/warhorn or focus (what ever rocks your boat) or staff.
---
If you want to do instanced PvE then you would have to swap to full Berserker and a more dps oriented build. But playing together with your husband means you can do damage and support at the same time and you two should have no issues with anything in the open world or story missions.
---
I can still time my sword 2, sword 4, shield 4 - if I know there'll be a lot of damage flying around, I save them to mitigate it. It failed me many times when tanking Deimos though, the knockback will be the end of me one day...
---
Oh, it's coming. They still have to do "Tradeoffs^TM\" for Mirage (Ambush coming off dodge and going to F4 would make sense as you'd at least need two buttons again for dodge + damage but as that makes sense it will be something else different and dumb), Soulbeast (should remove pet swap, but see prior point) and Firebrand (because with the right trait there is no trade off, EVER, for using the virtues and why the fuck would you NOT do that).
---
But because their balance team only seems to look at symptoms, not root causes, I expect the tradeoffs will be shit and still leave Firebrand and Scourge as the WvW Meta for the next year.
---
Because stacking next to your squad with the highest caster health is hard why...?
---
You should really look into sword weaver, it plays very differently and it's a ton of more fun imho. SC even did some impressive benchmarks on the sword build after staff nerf. Check my post history for more of my thoughts on the subject, I just recently wrote a big one on it.
---
There are very few nodes, I know there are one or two in crystal oasis but I can't remember where else (I know there is). Wiki should have all locations.
---
You should look into gw2taco. It's an ingame overlay that actively guides you trough griffon collection and other collectibles and achievements, it makes the grind much more mangable for me and actually fun.
---
its your graphix settings!
---
I love this event so much.
---
I know ~~that porn~~ exactly what you mean.
---
&gt;..*.650 games* this season at \~*15 minutes* each (game time + wait time + active build tweaks) means an average of almost *3.5h a day* of just PvP, *each and every day for three months*. 
---
Parameters: 650 games; 15 min = 0.25 hours; 3 monts = 90 days; 3.5 hours a day
---
650 x 0.25 hour = 162.5 hours
---
162.5 hours / 90 days = 1.805 hours
---
162.5 hours / 60 days = 2.708 hours
---
162.5 hours / 30 days = 5.416 hours
---
\------------------
---
3.5 hours x 90 days = 315 hours
---
315 hours / 0.25 = 1260 played games
---
what do you do for mobs at range?  considering flamethrower is kinda limited to tagging while roaming.
---
Correction, at rank 1 ya can only use 1 ability, the others get unlocked at lvls 3, 5 and 10 iirc
---
You never know which straw will break the camel's back. I ended up quitting League of Legends because they made a Nautilus themed reef in Australia. This was, of course, after lots of other things stacked up-- but the build templates could very well be that individually inconsequential straw that breaks the camel's back.
---
Seriously, what you're saying makes no sense to this conversation. It's like you've doubled down on being an autistic neckbeard. Your replies read like you're having an argument with someone else about something else. It's really hard to comprehend, I'm sorry my bitching about some shit engineer gameplay has triggered you so but please stop, every reply you post is just more gibberish down a tangent I couldn't give a shit about; that has nothing to do with my original comment.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
When the hell was it said they are banning ArcDps?
---
I know right? What a travisty that I've managed to find a game that I've been able to play for nearly a decade that hasn't pissed me off with any of it's changes, wahoooo.
---
Almost like I play things I enjoy and have a good idea of what to expect from ArenaNet and always have.
---
This has nothing to do with meta. If your skills, traits and weapons say support but your stats say high damage it's like you are a doctor with a rocket launcher. Your 0 healing power and 0 concentration firebrand will do some healing and boons, but they could be incredibly stronger with the correct gear.
---
I hate how my favorite Metal Legion track "Bound by Blood" is basically pure propaganda for Bangar's plan... It's such a good song, though.
---
Balance being so atrocious so few builds are functional there is no reason for templates... that's a new one.
---
Templates would even then be handy for pvp and wvw.
---
&gt; In short we want a return of the brain game that was the “build wars”.
---
**you* want
---
I'm on my berserker in berserk mode wearing berserker gear
---
You never needed 2300 rating for top 250. Rest is true.
---
Why be a small gnome when I can be BIG CAT!?
---
Hey I'm doing my best ok? People these days... ^(/s)
---
Years of abuse and neglect getting too clear to defend by the openworld whiteknights trying to maintain their superiority over the "minority" of players that play anything that isnt hypercasual.
---
I'm trying to find time to get into gw1 and I have to say it's nice the community is still trying to keep the game alive. I always see players running around and it always makes me happy.
---
Most of my time is on a human rev, asura chrono and sylvari guardian for wvw yet i have 5 charr.
---
I doubt anyone in your group is enjoying playing with Minion Master. Playing 0 dps spec and leeching other players...
---
I have chars approaching 5th birthday and a few hundred hours playtime with this in the corner. It's literally not worth the clicks.
---
When I saw the first post, about the e-mail, I was hesitant to give them credit. It was a horrendous mistake and horribly mismanaged, but I was glad they at least took another look into it. Then I saw the other post and realized why they did it. They deserve no credit for any part of how it was handled. The implementation of the spyware was shady and poorly designed. The response to support tickets was atrocious, to the point that somebody needed to threaten legal action for months to solve their mistake for them. And at that point, I 100% believe that they wouldn't have said a thing if they didn't know for a fact that the person who uncovered it would make a post about it.
---
I wouldn't mind Anet starting a new &amp; exciting IP. I can see your issue with MMO's beeing kinda outdated genre. But it's very much in trend with the "live services" Ubisoft &amp; EA try to implement everywhere.
---
I could imagine "GW3" getting a bit more into the "looter shooter" genre, but with more similar combat to GW2 instead of beeing a shooter. This is actually a bit more "back to the roots" of GW1, as well. You could have community hubs to meet ppl and group up and then open worlds to explore, story missions experience and dungeons / raids to challange you and your team.
---
Hopefully with gamepad compatibility right from the bat. I'd buy that. I'd play that.
---
It being one-sided is already better than the mess that is Kasjory. In the PS Logan gets constant flack for running to his owner causing the death of Snaff, and in LS3 their relationship is also addressed (I won't spoil it for the OP).
---
Kasjory has been stale since 2013, with a couple of short couple crises that ended up nowhere. 2019 Kasmeer is the same as 2013 Kasmeer, probably even worse since her family issues have just disappeared.
---
I don't think the OP was whining about a "lesbian relationship" since Caithe×Faolain was a thing in 2012, too, and it was handed in a decent way back then.
---
You get the meet your imperator achievement for every legion. There's a bit of ash specific dialogue I believe but I haven't played the map in a week or so because of exams so I'm not 100% on that. I only play ash legion so I can't say if there is any for iron.
---
i plan to try engi with perma swiftness and stab and try to get superspeed uptime as high as possible.
---
Stat boost reduced, no more traited regen, only the warrior can pick up the banners, can't carry the banners anymore as picked up banner immediately disappear.
---
On the plus side, picking up banner reduces banner recharge time so 100% banner uptime is possible. It requires vigilance from the warrior to time the cd though, therefore no more put down and forget ala ranger druids.
---
There is GW2 Taco, which is an overlay for GW2. It has markers for just about everything and you can even get overlays that show you the most effective path to complete a map.
---
The WvW and PvP balance team may be nearly inexistent, but they do have metrics, and if they see something working way more often than average, they will adjust it even if the overall power of the profession isn't that strong.
---
In extreme cases in which people are killed way too often after being hit by that skill, they may disable it altogether, like with Chaotic Interruption. 
---
The point is, we as players only have the perspective of our own gameplay and the games we may spectate, but they have records and data of all matches.
---
And the squeaky wheel gets the grease.
---
And the best thing is, it's available on the [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/arenanet/sets/metal-legion) along with the other 2 songs!
---
I remember that after 20 minutes of fighting that Karka i got DCed, and couldn't get back into a game. And next morning i found out that i missed out on a kewl new backpack with tentacles.
---
Ah found https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Exclusives_Chest
---
Bah 2k is too much for that. U can just wait
---
It would be cool if salvaging it directly gave you a better spread of materials with T1 to T6 materials and a very rare chance of ascended materials. Kind of like [Magic-Warped Packets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Magic-Warped_Packet) letting you choose between better chance of rarer gear or better chance of rarer materials, but that doesn't happen. It will just give you more or less the same materials as opening and salvaging, just worse.
---
So it's better to open and then salvage.
---
As what u/RenaDrayen said, the missing piece is probably not converting the volatile magic. Thanks for checking out my spreadsheet. I did a couple of tests on Dragonfall (one very recently too) and I got around the same gold per hour as you did without converting so it seems you're on the right track.
---
I believe that Dragonfall (S4 map) is currently the most popular, but some people still run SW
---
It is unpolite not to give the source for the scientists
---
I open all, then:
---
* Ecto-giving ones with silver-fed.
---
* Non-ecto ones with upgrades with runecrafter.
---
* Non-ecto ones without upgrades with copper-fed.
---
Oh I see. Ty very much
---
Dropped twice the shoulders and immediately sold them for 12 each since I do not like them. Ye, ring drops sucks .
---
Thank you!
---
As a followup, is SW still opened on a 50 char?
---
And I heard of dragonfall, even ran for a couple hours but didn't quite grasp how to make gold out of that, I basically opened chests, identified the gear, salvaged and sold everything. Something i'm doing wrong?
---
Still waiting for Lost Ark...
---
you have any more of them pixels?
---
Glad to see snargle getting some down time in his ever downward spiraling doom vortex called life.
---
Just like the furnace
---
Nah. There's some different details if your chosen god was Balthazar, but they are so faint most people don't even notice.
---
I’ve been the leader of a small guild for since early Living World season 1, I’ve met many people, made friends and had many friends disappear without a trace. During this time I made some amazing friends in game, one of whom I got married to last week. To honor our best friends we made through the guild, My at the time Fiancé (now wife) and I commissioned a local steel artist to reproduce our guild emblem in Steel (size 12” x 16”) which we gave as wedding gifts as many of our guild friends traveled across the states and even from Canada to join us on our special day to thank them for their friendship.
---
Khan-Ur's Gauntlet in Grothmar Valley. A lot of slutty chests to open.
---
I was thinking about coming back if templates were good but now I’m never going back.
---
I know that feel bro. And after that it's about opening bags in boxes in bags and deleting.
---
Item drop rates are one of the few reasons I quit the game. That and the most expensive item can’t even be sold using the in-game market system; you have to 3rd party trade it using the mail system and billions of ectos.
---
thanks for explaining, how you got to 3.5 hours a day. And holy crap, that's A LOT!
---
yeah but iirc its something like changing "they believed in you, they followed you, they relied on you" to "we believed in you, we followed you, we relied on you" (if just a human) or "I believed in you, I followed you, I relied on you" (if human with Balth as chosen god)
---
pshhhh
---
SOUL! KEEPER!  
---
DRAGON! REAPER!
---
How is outlining the issues not constructive feedback? 
---
Why is the amount of builds limited in a system we pay for? Why are options for legendary gear usage across characters and stat sets diminished? Why are already available alternatives immediately killed to shove an expensive and worse product down our throats? 
---
Why have you not acknowledged any of these concerns? 
---
Its only the anet whiteknights that trivalize the criticism. Which they do to dismiss and bury it. E.g. i see the typical anet fanboys pretend the only criticism is the system costing money. Yet this is very dishonest. This conclusion can only be reached if you maliciously refuse to acknowledge the genuine criticism. Its that or actually believing these populistic statements are the only criticism, which to me implies stupidity.
---
I think we'll see when/if they do a rework to core engi, as other people have said, focused on turrets, kits and pistols.
---
Honestly I'm still working my way through S4 so I haven't gotten to Dragonfall yet. I'm sure you can find a guide to the meta if you look around a bit. And yes, I believe most people open chests on lvl 50 toons.
---
Opponents whisper even when you're a good player.
---
Ehm yes izma , I was talking about the quest, that quest, the quest for the item, the item's quest.  I know about the 4 key to open the vault . Did 6 times. Got only shit and decided it not deserved my time. I do not care about headbanging emote nor about the weapons so I totally stopped doing any content on the island but the strike.
---
Asking the real question here
---
Awesome! Thank you so much :)
---
That's literally just your opinion.
---
I'm capped too, I also like to collect achieves. It's quite nice knowing you dont have to do them all. I do try to do at least 1 WvW one for the pot to stash in my bank and I gather at a home instance where the daily is.
---
I dont think I'd ever stress about it like you do though lol
---
Whats that Choja tonic the first guy is using?
---
I haven't ever seen it before, but since last week there's always at least one guy in my fractal using it.
---
But he's 12 and shy
---
Even in unranked there's a limit of 2 professions
---
I trade the mystic coins for provisioner tokens now.
---
Imagine if they announced GW3 but it turned out to be a mobile game like Aion 2. Now that would be funny.
---
He's on a Mac.
---
First time I've heard of it. Even if that was the case, they know this is exploited so don't give a choice
---
yoink
---
*"This should have been released 7 years ago"* is outlining the issue?
---
I see what you mean. Btw it was nerfed from superspeed to 60% movement speed buff
---
This is amazing! 
---
And congratulations!
---
Oh! That's the argument is it?
---
And his wall of nonsense isn't an opinion?
---
Besides, it takes objectively fewer clicks to get stuff done in arc' buildtemplates.
---
You can get most of that shit with the WvW or PvP track.
---
Just the skin. A +5/+9 infusion is way cheaper. It also has an extremely low drop rate.
---
ANet just needs to admit that it's Ascended, not exotic that is the new endgame BiS and increase those drop rates for those that hate their shit crafting system.
---
&gt;Personal story is fucking awful, rushed, horse shit. Season 3 is a video game.
---
On both a storytelling and a gameplay perspective, it's actually the other way around. 
---
PS has arcs and each one has an entry and an exit point. Characters around you are impacted by it and your character is established as a (ridiculously) competent leader. LS3 is a mishmash of three stories (White Mantle, Braham, Taimi's research) of which two are merged due to the summoned guy and one is dropped as suddenly as it was introduced. The player character shifts from leader to insecure schoolgirl to butt-monkey depending on which of the three teams worked on the episode and the season ends on a filler episode that does nothing but wink at the GW1 veterans by...turning an important organisation into a college fraternity. It's just filled with mood whiplash.
---
Gameplay-wise the PS is completely instanced, has a bunch of optional NPCs to talk to for world building and everything can be skipped for subsequent playthroughs (i.e. if you're doing it on another character, since the PS isn't repeatable). The Living World is almost entirely done in the open world (nothing says immersion like that stony NPC talking to you in the Fire Islands while three other commanders are loitering by), and ANet decided that each episode needed to be padded by making the player complete some of the heart quests. Everything is voiced and non-skippable, adding insult to injury.
---
The LS3 maps are on average good but at the same time they're gimmicky and not really focused on depicting an environment as opposed to hiding crap for scavenger hunts. I love Bloodstone Fen, Ember Bay and Bitterfrost Frontier but I'm not a huge fan of the other three...
---
Let’s be real. Nothing in the game is going to change.

These are probably the best, most relevant guides for getting into GW1 as a GW2 player.  Every so often I have a bad experience in GW2 and playing with henchmen or heroes is made to seem like a much better compromise.  People can be really erratic, fickle and awe-inspiring and not always in the best of ways.  I like seeing the NPC &amp; Hero chatter too, lol.
---
When I played WoW (from classic until WotLK) many people talked about WoW2.
---
So confused. Shared my image of my class set up with only 1 race, and got downvoted. This community just have a hate for Humans?
---
Well, obviously I blame Anet.  The change is shortsighted and reflects that they no longer have the ability to analyze changes across the entire game, namely that things move in PvE.
---
  
---
But I can equally blame the idiots on their official forums, who have been clamoring for this exact thing since before POF came out.   
---
   
---
They have the cake they wanted.  Now they can eat it too.
---
This is clearly a case of them implementing the exact change requested innumerable times by their official WvW and PvP forums.
---
Rarely has any event in this game left me with a grin while running it. But Metal Legion? Metal Legion left me laughing aloud, with a madman laugh, wanting *more*. Snargle's reaction here is perfect.
---
&gt; It might be a silly comparison 
---
Yep. Marriages are complex, life-altering things. Video games are an activity you do to have fun. Attempting to fix a floundering marriage requires both hope and good faith. But let's put aside that dubious analogy for a second...
---
I have a lot of history with WoW, which has this problem more than any other MMO I've played, probably simply by virtue of being older. You've got shitloads of people who don't really enjoy the game any more, and haven't for years, and think it's irredeemable garbage now, but they still play and obsessively follow the game they no longer even *like -* they feel too invested to give up, even when they're certain the game will never be good in their eyes again.
---
That last part is important. A lot of these people, when called out, will say "smh, it's *constructive criticism*, stop being a *white knight*, I'm just complaining because I want things to be better". This would be a reasonable defense if it weren't constantly juxtaposed with fatalistic shit about how the devs are all idiots, the game is doomed to be garbage forever, and the sky has fallen. You can't simultaneously believe all that and pretend that your "criticism" is meant to help.
---
And before someone misconstrues my point and jumps down my throat: I am not disputing (or endorsing) the validity of any of these complaints. If you think a game is irredeemably shit and you've lost all faith in the dev team, that's fine! You're allowed to have opinions and not enjoy things. But please, at least *pretend* (plausibly) to act rationally on those opinions.
---
TLDR: "feast with the other roaches" is a pretty fair phrase, honestly.
---
Like around the 2:00 mark
---
I did the end of citadel of flames p1 for tyrian masteries+fractals and raid for the rest on my alts for both hot and pof

What the what now?  What is the argument I supposedly started?  LOL.  All I did was give my opinion about a sink.  You're the one who made an assertion about what most people have in reply.  All my responses have been saying you need more data to prove your assertion, which you do not have.  You're still mad that other people do not blindly accept your assertions.  What are you going to do now?  Come over and make me accept it?  LOL.
---
&gt; I really don't see why skills+traits templates were not a day one feature 
---
*"Why wasn't this released 7 years ago?"*
---
You saying I paraphrased it wrong?
---
 I dont see why you keep arguing that such posts are not helping when you agreed they arent.
---
* Dont post useless whine.
---
* Do post well thought out criticism.
---
So true.
---
Well clearly reading isn't your strong suit because its October 29th.
---
You can't beat Acro Daredevil w/shortbow.
---
Perm swiftness
---
SB #1 can hit 4 targets (gently)
---
SB #4 for AoE
---
SB #5 catcup if you've fallen behind
---
Dagger Storm for AoE luls
---
Swipe...well last year Steal was helpful as a catchup, but RIP now.
---
Nah. It was clearly a direct fight.
---
His food ticks 3 times, and he got hit by lotus strike after the Backstab, which mean that the thief had already used his first two autoattacks before attenpting the BS.
---
That said he also got dismountes by lance right before. So i can assume he got ganked by at least two players.
---
There's a Rich Quartz Node in the southeastern end of Crystal Oasis.  Unlike the one in Dry Top guarded by the Skritt Queen, this one is character-bound, so multiple characters can harvest it each day.  If you want to try to farm Quartz, that's the best spot to do it.
---
Just bear in mind that there's other, more profitable places to park alternate characters, like the Sanctum of Nabkha.
---
Adding to that the fact that the drop rate for the visage is *ridiculously* low, even after having doubled it in the patch last week. At the moment, not even a single person can complete the collection, even if they wanted to. There aren't 3 visages on the TP, only two have been posted in the three weeks since the release of the episode.
---
Even if hundreds or  thousands of people wanted to complete this achievement, it's literally impossible. Not to mention that the only two visages posted are at 9k and 10k gold.
---
I know you're having a hard time grasping some things, but do try to read again the part where I specify power revenant and reaper DPS in instanced PVE (aka raids) and not some support spec.
---
https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/
---
Power reaper only slightly above power spellbreaker and in the lowest quartile. But sure, "insane buffs".
---
 
---
What to do next?  
---
Hi there,
---
So recently I've obtained full ascended gear and made my first legendary, Sunrise. Ever since I did that I don't really know what to do in the game though. Legendary back item/armor doesn't really interest me as of now.
---
Is there anyone that has been in a similar situation and what pointers do u have to focus on?
---
**1 Comment**
---
Hellyeah! lml
---
ok, that is 1 of the 3 points I raised. Also apparently 2019 - 2014 = 7. I get it now, you are just a moron. k
---
What I'm hearing most is that their big announcement backfired spectacularly. A lot of veterans hoping to hear big news were left with a sour taste in their mouths and have either lost interest or are well on their way.
---
&gt;Comparing the official build templates to an unsupported, third-party mod is stupid.
---
The stupid part would be that the unofficial mod does a much better job with templates at no cost, and has been doing so for a couple years I think.
---
At first i was like dafuq? Like visiting khan ur? Then i saw the price of the item and kinda died smiling

Outside fractal u do not need ascended. Not even in raids. Plz stop with thia
---
Well, it's (arguably, of course) fun to play when you learn how to rotate, and what classes do, and are able to handle idiots trash talking you for the dumbest reasons.
---
Which I would definitely say is a lot to ask of new players, and that is one of the problems of PvP. And clearly for most GW2 players the last point is an incredibly huge ask.
---
Note the similarity to MOBAs like League of Legends. The problems of PvP always come full-circle to that shitty E-sports design paradigm they went with.
---
Just remove the trinkets honestly and your damage is fine relative to other people on flamethrower. Alternatively just play staff tempest tbh, enough range and mobility to tag everything as you run by and enough cleave to ensure you tag everything at the mob doors, this is usually my go to for lab.
---
ONE CHARR!!
---
^(even though I'm Asura)
---
But some games do it right. I don't think we should be throwing the baby with the bathwater here. The blame lies not in the business model but in ANet's handling of it.
---
Look at Path of Exile or Warframe. While they have similar business models (hell, you can buy way more stuff in Warframe even), they haven't fallen prey to the idea of making the game objectively worse. Perhaps more importantly though, if the community is heavily opposed to something, they *actually listen*. Not just platitudes, but actual changes to fix the problem. And they don't even have GW2's boxed price as a buffer for it!
---
ID, salvage and sell everything.  And turn your Volatile Magic into Trophy Shipments, then sell those too, unless your purpose for getting gold is to obtain T6 trophies in which case selling them is silly.
---
Email with a serial code...duh
---
You should read a post before making a comment highlighting how stupid you are. 
---
Its not my fault they never game me a serial code
---
The announcement was totally bizarre. It was so hyped up and then most of the announcement itself was just talking about the story - interesting but not exactly announcement-type stuff. The really cool things they mentioned about the new map/strike missions/world boss etc were rushed through and they didn't even mention anything to do with raids or fractals, leading some to speculate that they'd quietly stopped development on both.
---
A week later a couple of websites published interviews with the team and were FULL of really interesting comments (including confirmation that they WERE still working on raids and fractals) that should have been part of the announcement!
---
Closing it out with a load of marketing stuff didn't really help either.
---
Thats what the dlc i bought from them is called  blame them not me. Its in their damn email
---
Look for skins you like, and acquire them.  Go hunt through the wardrobe.  Making your first Legendary is a big accomplishment, but not every new skin worth getting is Legendary, so a smaller feat might be more up your alley.
---
Alternately, if you haven't yet, go finish your collection of mounts.  Roller Beetle/Griffon/Skyscale!
---
Mounts invalidate a lot of what your talking about for a large section of the player-base. Maybe showcase how you can use movement skills to traverse certain obstacles in pvp/wvw or skip certain mechanics in pve. This like that would probably be received better.
---
Ask them? Its in their damn email receipt.  The only serial code they ever sent me.
---
It literally doubled your ability to cleanse, both yourself and others. Anytime you removed a condition, you removed an extra one. And scrapper has three aoe Condi clears, plus light fields. And every condition you removed gets converted to a boon. It got to the point where i would deliberately try to get get hit by Condi applying attacks just to get more boons.
---
Well, it makes Dragonfall even better, since Trophy Shipments are the most cost-effective way to get T6 mats!
---
Yeah, total snoozefest and was widely criticized as such back in the day.
---
And guess what? They have almost certainly already evaluated what would have the best efficiency. It is not like they just sat down and decided: "This is how we are going to do the monetization of templates". They have numbers, they have trends and so on.
---
Mount Adoption Licenses mostly.  I think there are a few packs that let you select a mount for 800-1200 gems, but I think it's mostly a 400 gem gambling system.
---
So are you a ftp or not?
---
Because if you BOUGHT a DLC it automatically changes your ftp account to a "normal", paid account.
---
If you buy a dlc, you should get a serial code either via email or if you bought it from the ingame store it opens your browser and displays the serial key there, too (if I remember correctly)
---
They've had several Mount Adoption Licenses with a variety of skins each.  They rotate in and out of the gem store, so keep your eyes open for them.
---
Look, the primary purpose is grind, okay? You have to spend months on the new map and _maybe_ get lucky. Ideally you'll get frustrated and but it off TP, so they get bump in play time and a gold tax. Win-win for them.
---
I'll try to make it clear why I keep arguing with you.
---
u/zosin wondered why it is not a day one feature. u/jucelc stated they asked this question on the forums. You replied what possible positive answer they could get. Your post doesn't offer constructive criticism towards them. u/nicebrood replied that these people are malicious trolls. Yet nothing in his post will adress the genuine criticism or empathise with people who have issues. Neither of you are constructive here.
---
The first post offers criticism which is fair; but not directly constructive. That is to say it doesn't offer a solution to solve this problem (at this point) to anet. It CAN lead to constructive solutions and improvements as i've also outlined. As I stated before : not releasing build templates sooner lead to the adoptation of arc templates. Banning this feature people have grown accustomed to isn't good faith, especially when the new templates lack some of its functionality despite having a clear edge due to being built in. Allowing it to continue could alleviate that. That's constructive criticism as a result of the previous. 
---
You're very angry at zosin because their post isn't "constructive" immediately and rather raises criticism. So what do you do? Well you raise criticism without being constructive. Then jucelc circlejerks and trolls about other people being malicious while doing exactly what he accuses them of. And you? Well you continue to hammer they aren't unstructive in the most unconstructive way possible. 
---
So in your own words : don't post useless whine, do post well thought out criticism. And your one line summary of "what constructive could you even get to that?" is neither well thought out, nor constructive. It is just useless whine. 
---
You see how you paraphrased it wrong yet? If their post doesn't immediately offer a solution- but still fair criticism that sparks debate, which can lead to constructive solutions- then it is a very reasonable topic. Unlike your post which, instead sparks unconstructive debate about how criticism of any kind is bad. It is incredibly hypocrite to fight "unconstructive cricism" with your own "unconstructive criticism".
---
I thought the scelerite backpack was earned during the southsun storyline in LS1?
---
Sometimes i wonder if people are dumb for real or just trying to troll and looking like idiots. 
---
Also what the heck is heart of winter?
---
&gt; That is probably some sort of misunderstanding because doing game development without some sort of version control system seems insane.
---
As a release manager, I agree. Sadly I've seen too many dev lanes not give 2 shits about proper version control, proper dev branches, merges, etc.
---
Awesome giveaway! If I hadn't just bought them recently I'd be totally down, that being said, anyone in this thread looking to become a "god among mere mortals" I'd be happy to part up to work on that
---
Thank you, will keep an eye, thought they were obtainable somewhere else
---
This is not even anywhere near an accurate representation of the current state of GW1. It's not as populated as it was in its heyday but there's still a decent amount of active players trading in Kamadan or doing the daily Zaishen challenges or speedruns or what have you. You'll probably have some trouble if you plan on going through the different campaigns with together other players but you can always try joining some of the big guilds that are still active, or asking around on the gw1 subreddit for people to join you. There's also weekly events organized for stuff like AB and FA. And like others said even solo it's still a fun game, well worth a try.
---
Well it is "their" choice. They decided to bear a rise of the militancy among players. Consequnces of such decision is obviously unclear.
---
They could still have given us actual gear templates as well and not 'only' the loadouts... The code is mostly already there.
---
If you are curious as to how it could work:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dcn35w/gear_blueprints/
---
I'm starting to make meta builds for Fractals and raid. Haven't completed a raid yet but for Fractals I have a **Healbrand** and a **Holosmith Power**.
---
Right now I have a full light armor ascended set and I was wondering which of the light classes should I build next. I was thinking of a condi build, but it seems kind of unpopular lately.
---
Any suggestions?
---
You are forgetting that the developer of the template mod created on their own free time, of their own accord. The ArenaNet developers were paid for their work on an app that is much better integrated into the game's systems. I'm not saying the official version is flawless, but all this drama over a system that is only barely used is exactly why ArenaNet didn't want to bother with it. No matter what happens to the game, this subreddit finds something new to complain about.
---
Deadeye has an open world pistol/pistol build. Though it provides mobility compared to rifle Deadeye, the playstyle gets old quickly. Personally I prefer rifle Deadeye between the two. Just perch somewhere out of reach and unload on mobs all unfair like lol. 
---
Staff Weaver is a poor choice for solo play. Nice to tag in group events like Bounties though. I’ve switched my Sword Weaver (much stronger than Staff) to Fresh Air Tempest. With Tempest, main dps comes from Overloading Air, it’s just channeling basically. Tbh Tempest produces results easily without the need to jump through hoops ala Weaver. 
---
Honestly a really strong and fun class to play in open world is Guardian. The GS is melee but super strong. It’s hella fun to pull mobs into a tight group via GS5 then mow them down with GS2 whirl. Guardian can also wield a Scepter and summon Spirit Weapons for your ranged needs.
---
Although this comment's argument is not a valid argument, I will suggest that Anet might have problem with old-not-well-quoted codes. As you already know so well, if you are NOT the original programmer, it is so hard to manage client codes.
---
As far as I recall this reasoning was brought up when people wanted to be able to sell collection items for legendary collections, because deleting them individually - especially with confirmation - was arduous. They said a bug had already lead to a number of people receiving potentially an infinite amount of the collection items, and selling an infinite amount of items for 1 copper is obviously a problem. As said, it seems less possible to abuse given that the rewards occur once per character, and it takes time to create characters, but I reckon that's why certain items don't sell for anything at all.
---
I've been playing since beta, yet the only thing I really accomplished is 5 chars on 80 and only one of them did the personal story and is now doing LS2.
---
If there's one thing I honestly regret it is that I deleted so many characters just because of how they looked, what choices I made during character creation etc. Basically minor things that made me feel upset so much, I couldn't get over it and deleted them, over and over again.
---
I just created a Norn warrior and picked Wolf as my spirit because it just felt right in that moment. One day later and my head is bombarding me with OCD questions like "Why didn't I pick bear?" and all that stuff.
---
These thoughts haunt me and are the reason I missed out on so much content, because there was always something I regretted or that felt slightly off.
---
Now, the older I get the more I realize this game is hugely about freedom, about variety and creating your own story.
---
No matter what choices you make, learn to love your characters and actually try to play as them, not just with them. 
---
This might be not quite the solution to your problem (if you wanna call it a problem, maybe it's a chance, sometimes I wish I could delete my characters) but maybe it still gives you some insight that others struggle as well for various reasons.
---
&gt; Circles are just tools for people to get close together and fight
---
This. Capture points are just tools needed to punish people for leaving a fight. In WvW some roaming specs can reset fights indefinitely, Conquest exists to solve the problem posed by the crazy amount of mobility/easy stealth access in GW2.
---
I forge the exotics too, that is, I forge one set of four exotics every time I level a character to 80. You don't get enough for a second forge. Typically it's about 70s, sometimes you get lucky and get a rune or a specific stat line that sells for a bit more. But generally speaking I'd rather have an option to get nothing at all.
---
Even the annoyances are fun with someone!
---
Leeeeeeeegion!
---
Oh boy, another "I'm too stupid/lazy to remember my login info, so ArenaNet should just make password resets instant/insecure!" post...
---
Nah, as a dev myself, you can damn well wait.
---
Very nice! Thanks for the details. I've often found people forget to implement good hanging mechanisms in their art (I work with artists/galleries irl)
---
Glad that isnt the case :)
---
The community set the price of this rare item though no?
---
the heart contained lots of items that added up to the overall value.
---
Do you mean Heart of Thorns by any chance LMFAO
---
or the person who sets the drop rates just really suck at math ...
---
ascended adds on maybe another 40g to its values
---
factor in other stuff like cost of leveling to 500 and the skin and it should be worth maybe 500g
---
Me too. I only ever played call of duty on Xbox 360 and that was my only multiplayer experience- then I played Skyrim from Literally 2011-2015 ish. I got a gaming PC and played overwatch and that game put me through several stages.
---
My first stage was blaming teammates, raging, getting upset etc. My second stage was acting like an entitled know it all. My third stage was realizing how much of a tool I'd been and nowadays I *am impossible to tilt* because I just don't let it happen.
---
Don't let it get to you, it's a game. And if it does get to you, shhhhh. Because you make everyone else just as miserable as you are when you say bad things. Best thing we can do is congratulate people, take our losses and say gg, and start the match with positive glhf type stuff.
---
I say "salty vets can't do it" because a lot of people who are upset at videogames don't *want* to improve their attitude. They 100% think they're within their rights to be mad and yell and flame. So until they work it out and let that anger go somehow and realize a videogame isn't a huge deal....
---
Point is, somehow we have to get the salty people to work on their selves
---
All of this happened before with mount lootboxes, people on this sub kicked up a fuss and guess what, now they buy mount skin lootboxes. 
---
Give it a few months and I guarantee there will be a "Build template slot sale, get them now!" post.
---
2 hours? Just buy the keys ...
---
Achievements are pointless in this game anyway. They keep putting them in but what's the point? Leaderboards? Everyone who didn't play LS S1 or the early festivals are screwed anyway, since those are retired now and there's no way to get them. So what's the point? I mean I still do as many almost all of them anyway, since I'm a completionist, but there's always that voice in the back of my head that tells me I'm wasting my time doing so. I was out of the race the second they retired those points. Achievements like this one and I'm rich you know can fuck right off, and honestly, this game and anet can follow them.
---
what about the "It takes to many time to queue", "There is no competition", "Anet doesn't care of this game mode" arguments ?
---
Well damn, now I know what I do in my spare time.
---
when you say power revenant, I thought you took into account any and all power revenant builds, which should include the very popular support alacrigade variants. 
---
&gt;power reaper only slightly above power spellbreaker and in the lowest quartile.
---
So do you want it to be at the top?, incredibly asinine.
---
If you'd like an untiltable teammate in casual rounds I would be glad to hop in with you some time. I am a noob but I hope to remain positive even if I get trashed again and again
---
I participate in many tournaments too, so not sure where that puts me.
---
rip completionist happened a long time ago with requiem armor and dragonsblood weapons
---
Now that's what I call relationship goals

ah ... right nice flaming sword :D

goes very well with the luminous sword skin

According to my brother's friend's cousin its
---
Bratty Sis - Meeting with Step Sis and My Cock Slips in. S4: E2
---
When there are 15 enemies balled up and you dont start with shortbow.
---
Damage Scrapper? Wanna try it.
---
&gt; This, is just not an accepted idea for anyone playing this game.
---
I am absolutely fine with paying for extra equipment templates.
---
Theres already SO much visual noise. If they offer us an option to turn off infusions/visuals of others then I support this. But at the current time, hell no
---
No you don't.
---
Now I know what you meant by *show the world how badly you treat me*.
---
It was totally worth it. Love my Choya.
---
Does ele dagger mainhand have an evade or condi removal? Must've missed that patchnote.
---
right shortbow emm i'll try it next time . thanks for the tip
---
what?
---
Have to say, with scourge gone, the "clusterfuck of red circles and particle effects" is so much better. I can actually see stuff in teamfights.
---
Neck tits, owOoo!
---
Well guild wars 2 is a bigger deal in the mmo landscape objectively speaking.
---
They did? God i literally had only that to finish aurora. Maybe i got in an achiev limbo, thanks for the info!
---
20+ infusions should give you a titel "I wasted time and gold"
---
So now you have to work in the same field to comment on a product/company. Silly. 
---
It doesn't require anything to compare companies and their statements. Anet themselfs often use problems in the engine to explain why certain things can't be done or take so long. I can perfectly fine compare dev studios with similar numbers of devs to see that anet is slacking in many regards. Not just that I can just compare their gw2 content progress to what they did in gw1. 
---
Templates are a great example. Overly complicated and heavily limited for no reason? No, because of engine problems in gw2 that were not present in gw1. I don't need to work on a mmo to see that connection. They themselfs stated that certain aspects of the code can't even be touched without breaking compleatly.
---
Legendary runes and sigils need auras first
---
I alternate between Bonetti's Rapier with a green &amp; white w/ gold accents heritage armor for a very GW1 feel...and a darker look...still using heritage armor but with midnight fire dye (which looks stupid good on cloth), white, and dark but bright fuschia...and with this look I skin swords with Lord Taeres' Shadow.
---
&gt; You are playing on their ranking, chances are you are at their skill level.
---
unfortunately usually the most annoying ones are also the one on the team that sucks the most
---
Why you have a +20?
---
Although you are not exactly all that "nice" in game &lt;3 (I was the guard you were complaining about for not "doing anything" when I couldnt save you when I was on CD).
---
&gt;I was thinking of a condi build, but it seems kind of unpopular lately.
---
I dunno where you got this from, but it isn't really true at all.
---
Your choices are either a scourge, mirage, or weaver. Any one of them is fine, but scourge is more niche than the other two and is easier to play.
---
Asura are by far easier than the rest, even if only because you can see so much of your surroundings...but I have never liked using Charr for JPs. Norn are okay, they just feel clunky, but to this day, taking a charr through almost any jumping puzzle will see me falling and screwing up at least 5x more than any other race.
---
&gt; Your bias against Necro is showing
---
TIL that saying necro is good is showing a bias against necro.
---
What an amazing and thoughtful gift.
---
Congratulations!
---
This kinda blew up, so let me set a few things straight, since you made it personal:
---
@Etheri
---
&gt;  Then jucelc circlejerks and trolls about other people being malicious while doing exactly what he accuses them of. 
---
First of all, I was neither trolling, nor had any malicious intent. I paid for this game just as any of you, and this means I expect certain things in return. This isn't a charity, nor is it a carnival ride as some people here seem to think - "Get on and enjoy the ride whatever it may be, without complaining". That's not how I see it. This leads me to what I expect for my money: 
---
@Sevenix2
---
&gt; To be fair, what constructive answer were you possibly hoping to get out of such a question?
---
&gt; How is saying "This should have been released 7 years ago" constructive feedback?
---
That's not what I said on the forums and that's not even a question the way you phrased it. My question was "*Why* was this not in the game 7 years ago?". 
---
I **expected** a reasonable explanation why a highly valued GW1 feature was not prioritized in the development of a direct sequel game. Which ANET knew going into GW2 would be even more important given they  decided to tie stats and traits. 
---
And why was it *further* ignored for years after the game's release? And even after its first expansion which added even more reason to have templates? And even still after GW2 players kept asking for it at every single opportunity? 
---
But instead all I see as an answer is that this is the company that took 2.5 years to release 16 legendary weapons that were originally advertised as features of its first expansion pack. Meanwhile managing to release full 16 weapon gemstore sets every 2 months. So yes indeed, what was I hoping to hear from a company that clearly mismanages its resources all the time? Answers? An excuse? An apology of some kind maybe? Other game developers provide these things to their fanbases and their games are successful. I don't think I need to name them as they've been mentioned a hundred times on this sub and if I do name them, you'll just tell me to go play them instead of complaining here. Guess what? I am playing them and that doesn't exclude me playing GW2 and thus demanding answers for a product I am a paying customer for. No, it doesn't have a subscription fee like some of the other games out there, but that doesn't mean that I'm not supporting it through the buying of expansions, gemstore items, and spreading the word of mouth to get other people to do the same and ultimately line up ANET's pockets. 
---
@Nicebrood
---
&gt; A small but vocal part of the community have turned in to malcontent trolls with no genuine interest in the game doing well anymore and they only hang around to spread misery and stirr up as much drama because they personally don't enjoy the game anymore, so why should anyone else?
---
I am disappointed and I am voicing that disappointment. Just because you would rather live in a protected bubble free of any negative thoughts, emotions, drama, and things that personally offend you, doesn't mean I don't have the right to be upset. If no one speaks up nothing will change. If enough people cause drama things will change as has been proven time and time again (examples include Flamekissed armor, mount licenses, Jessica Price, every massively article that has criticized ANET and many other things). And guess what? Things changed because of those who spoke up, so you can enjoy playing in your bubble world of perfect peace and quiet. And build templates will change because of this debacle too.
---
Like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-OvPpUXR3E), but it's more work than sb daredevil.
---
That's the thing. When people talk Support.. they only mean boons. Anything else is minor support lol
---
Thieves, holos and mesmers in a nutshell.
---
Another advice: watch a pvp streamer or youtuber. I watched jawgeous playing holo for like 2 hours and then did many unranked matches and managed to get 13 wins in a row because of the stuff I learned from watching him. I always had the feeling of having a high impact on the game's outcome. Jawgeous showed stuff like different kinds of stealths (stealth stomp, stealth approach an enemy who doesn't know I'm there, stealthing the group when going mid first time), general holo skill combos, kiting!, knowing what fights you can pick, how to use the map terrain effectivly, rotating properly. Later I did my placements and got into gold 1 (is that even good?).
---
Or maybe holo is just broken af and everyone can do it.
---
whoud be more interesting if you got some scaling aura from 200+ agony
---
To confirm my other comment, just 3m ago I tried, this is the result:

Hm 1 minute. It took me 10 seconds, but that's cool man, good job.

---
Also ft. one riled up Runebanger.
---
Most arena-based PvP games have *much* cleaner designs then the mess of GW2 sigils, runes, traits, and specs.
---
Take league of legends. It has 200 different characters, and 200 different items, but it has a unified trait tree, unified summoner spells, each character has five, very clearly telegraphed abilities. It's a crisp, clear, non-cluttered design.
---
Now look at GW2. Half the traits in this game are 'do X when Y happens', which is completely invisible and non-obvious to the person fighting you. And half the abilities are just a soup of particle effects and red circles, and you have no idea what you're supposed to dodge, what you're supposed to interrupt, and what you're supposed to tank and heal through.
---
The real answer is to just flex
---
The fake answer is that pushing to certain resistance tiers is viable for stat minmax in fractals. Taking ele for example:
---
* 150 AR (Standard): You need Assassin stats on shoulders, gloves, legs, amulet, and ring x1 to crit cap
---
* 207 AR (Fractal God + Max Impedence + Mistlock Singularity): You need Assassin stats on helm, shoulders, gloves, boots to crit cap
---
* 245 AR (Fractal God + Max Impedence + Mistlock Singularity + [Alba](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Anguished_Tear_of_Alba)): Full Berserker stats on everything.
---
245 AR is the number for weavers because without Druids in meta comps any more you no longer have access to Spotter or reliable Weakness output. This number is different per class and comp to reach your precision cap. To reach this you need 3x +15 AR then fill out the rest of your slots with +9/5s, or if you're super crazy you can make +18s to use another +9/5 or if you're seriously insane you can make a +27 to pair with 2x +9/5s.
---
GW2Efficiency shows a +15 valued around 367 gold right now. +18 at 2,122 gold and +27 at a theoretical 63,942 gold.
---
Better than what I could do. Nice job!
---
Invigorating Precison instead of No Quarter in Critical Strikes and the passive of the heal signet helps you passivly maintain high health while attacking.
---
I find writing and/or gameplay designs between individual episodes to be really hit or miss, almost 50/50. I suspect the way different teams handle each episode has something to do with it. 
---
The Season 3 and 4 packs would be worth it just for the zones and resources they unlock, even if Season 3's story is completely all over the place with one character's personal issues souring everything. It got a bit better with Season 4; more coherent, at least.
---
Ahh, gotcha. Just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something, but I'll stick with flamethrower and rocket boots.
---
Reminds me of the runescape 3 character style. Great talent
---
Omegalul. I understand needed like +15 or +16 for getting to fractal god. But just a regular +20 on the side is yikes. If the person needed stat infusions with ar. Just buy the +5 stat +9 ar. I mean... there’s ghostly infusions there poly luminescent infusions etc. way cheaper then +20
---
As it would be my first condi build, would you be able to recommend me one, for people new to condi-based DPS?
---
Cause they're rich you know.
---
exactly. what was it, 8 months? imagine you got your acc banned for something you didn't do. no one would feel comfortable or safe from being unfairly banned after all your appeals are straight up denied with "we know better, you're lying. blocked, cya."
---
I’d like to see a full visual effects overhaul splitting them into wardrobe like category slots such as aura’s, body part effects like legendary weapon arm effects and footfalls that are unlocked when an item is account bound. 
---
Mix and matching legendary effects would be cool. I know I’d like to have Tigris with its legendary counterparts effects.
---
What do you expect to happen by posting here...twice? None of us know your password. You have a ticket. Just wait for the ticket to be resolved. And remember your passwords.
---
Anet is super strict with account recovery because of the number of hacked accounts that occurred due to unrelated databreaches (people can't help but use same un/pw for everything). They can also be really strict with gem purchases because of the number of chargebacks made against stolen accounts.
---
Once you get your password reset, I would recommend also setting up two-factor authentication. I believe that allows password reset confirmation via SMS.
---
&gt;renown hearts are awesome
---
Erm...really? I think I'd rather have quests, but perhaps that's just me. To me hearts are the weakest part of playing open world.
---
i can't say i agree but i haven't played the latest patch, only to the one before that. the dialogue and writing since personal story hasn't improved imo and if anything it has gotten worse.
---
i hate all 3 of those characters. asura take away the immersion for me with all the pseudo sci fi crap and the fact that they seem to have a leading or co leading role throughout most of the story is a huge turn off for me. i came for fantasy, if i want sci fi i'll go to swtor. i find that all of the races seem to be cliches and the asura cliche happens to be one i despise.
---
I think this question would be more fitting in AA subreddit, mostly because you're already well acquainted with GW2 and not the other way around. Whether you crosspost or not, I'll be looking forward to other replies as it's something I'm really interested in as well.
---
Honestly if it wasn't for having limited game time nowadays I'd be running it side by side with GW2.
---
World wise. AA is smaller but more open. In GW2 unless a boss train is going on, most zones are almost completely empty except the newest. AA is similar with its events, but if you look for it especially when the server is high pop you can find open world pvp. 
---
Gear in AA is a lot of work, either grinding or crafting and it does go up the harder you work. So it is more like WoW/FFXIV than GW2 which is more of a plateau that never changes. I know the gear I have in GW2 from like 5 years ago is still top tier today. That isn’t the case in AA and will likely not be the case moving forward. 
---
Combat wise, GW2 and AA to me have pretty similar combats. Both are tab target with good amounts of constant movement. Very rarely do you ever just stand still and use abilities. 
---
AA is a ton of grinding. I don’t even think even anyone in the Korean version has hit the max gear score.
---
Blast that poison field for weakness = win
---
I mean, that's because - like a lot of extremists - Bangar starts out sounding quite reasonable: Asura have a running Inquest problems, humans have Gods and ancient cults trying to screw the world, Sylvari are Sylvari, and Norn are just about the only sane ones... but are still recovering from Jormag killing a fair fraction of their civilization.
---
Charr *do* have every reason to be proud of taking back their land. The Legions *do* need to be united now. Charr *do* need to stand tall, together, against the crazy stuff Tyria throws at them.
---
Of course Bangar then goes off the deep end trying to harness an *Elder Dragon*; that's extremists for you. But I hope they have characters acknowledge he wasn't *entirely* wrong.
---
Oh I see, mine from this morning's run was accidentally sent to you.  I'll DM you my account name so you can rectify this unfortunate bug.
---
Stack enough poison = daze
---
Maybe someone has an answer to where this serial code is that they think i have? I dunno.  Maybe theres other options? 
---
Jesus fking christ this community is awefull. 
---
Every google search had said " i forgot my serial code. " that isn't the case here.
---
So i made a post, to see if maybe its a mistake? Maybe its supposed to be some where. Maybe searching my email box for guild wars 2, anet and arena net won't find that specific email? (Even tho it found others)
---
What i did not expect were people being shitty, and trolling for a very common problem.
---
They had almost made scrapper good enough to do zerk open world PvE stuff then this... IDK what happened to those supposed damage buffs (The place it was slightly lacking after the gyro changes) because my own attempts at running around felt even worse than before.  
---
I don't even know with Scourge... I think I'll just stick with ~~REDACTED CAUSE I DONT WANT IT NERFED~~ cause reasons and stuff.
---
Maybe I overstated - It's an okay variation from typical "kill X/bring Y", but some activities are of low-to-no enjoyment. I focused on talking about dynamic events while typing about being awesome (to some extent), and then I realised I forgot to mention those heats and I didn't re-write the sentence.
---
Thanks for input, I somewhat agree!
---
I mean, you're comparing a great game that has been poorly managed for the last 4 or so years, on a monumental scale tbh, to a game that isn't released yet.
---
Yeah, but the cub will likely grow up one day to be standing as a sentry somewhere in the War in the Mists, and you'll have to gank him and stand on his corpse to complete a daily.  Best he start to get used to disappointment at a young age.
---
gw2 vet and just played aa unchained pts....have been bitter about gw2's direction and lack of communication. Offically quitting gw2, beautiful game but no noncombat activities,fishing, housing, farming, not to mention aau has naval battles/open world pvp/ crime system/ and most content is not instanced which gives the game a nice open world feel. So many things to do unlike gw2 which forces pvers to play a certain way ( meta trains). You can't even farm mobs on your own or you get diminishing returns.. not to mention inventory management is the real gw2 boss. So many great things about GW2 but I never realized how much I miss the sandbox experience of mmo's.
---
&lt;3
---
hammer rev is still solid. depends on the group for how it compares to scourge. rev is like scourge in that the damage isn't the whole story, the support it gives is really vital. So long as Dwarf is great, rev is great, and this patch saw a buff to Dwarf in roads. For melee-centric groups rev will do more of the pre-push hazing now than scourge, since pbaoe shades are so strong, making a placed shade a risk for 15s. for range groups scourge will spike higher than it used to, but not as often as rev, making it a good class to generate 1200r downs for the scourges to capitalize on.
---
I tried PvP a few times in the past. Earlier on, you just vs'ed bunker specs and you literally couldnt get people off points as they lived forever--very boring. Nowadays, you die instantly. Maybe there is counterplay, maybe you just need to watch for something, but as far as I know, I can be walking and burst 100 to 0 in a second or two, and never get a chance to figure out why/how or how I can prevent that in the future. 
---
And, akin to LoL/DotA, you need to work as a team to win. However, in gw2, even with the announcements, it feels like in general people are just bashing their heads against one function without the game ever encouraging them to function as a team or do something different.
---
oh my bad my reading comprehension was shit, I didn't grasp what you were saying fully.  
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Manifest\_Sand\_Shade](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Manifest_Sand_Shade)
---
It would be 3x3, 9, I believe. Base shade is still 3 target cap. Without Sand Savant, only the pbaoe target cap was raised to 5. I haven't checked in-game though, so if wiki/patch notes don't reflect live idk.
---
I mean, i been playing the mission daily and havent got a single one...so I guess getting 2 on single strike missiom is mega. Rare lol.
---
The fact is though, the pathetically late timeframe IS a factor for the  community’s discontent. Just because we can’t do anything to fix that aspect doesn’t mean it shouldnt be acknowledged. If the system came out the way it is now, but with the release of path of fire then I’m confident it would have been received much better.
---
Hold up, you think it's limited by how fast someone can click? 400 APM is meaningful actions per minute. You can easily click much faster if you don't need to move your mouse. Moreover, like with other exploits, it's not about the speed but the ease. You could potentially be at it 24/7. Using your APM as reference that's nearly 60 gold per day. Which is little compared to effective gold farms, but vastly more than the average player earns in a day.
---
Ew.
---
Ah yes, that old issue.
---
You should have saved them until you have unlocked anything under 100g at least.
---
If this is intended for fractals I wouldn't suggest a condi build at all (fractals stopped scaling with toughness a long time ago so power is able to phase much faster before most condi builds have a chance to ramp up). If you really want to make a condi build for fractals something like firebrand that has a lot of fast acting burning and still a lot of power damage is going to be much better. Not to mention that FB gets tome resets on adds. I'd suggest just building the [raid DPS version](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/) and running it in both (if you insist on bringing it to fractals). Otherwise [any of these builds](https://discretize.eu/builds) are going to be better fractal options.
---
Now if you're planning to run this in raids and your choices are mirage, scourge, or weaver I'd suggest trying to learn [mirage](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/mirage/condition/) since it's by far the best in slot for most of the condi preference fights in raids.
---
Also if you're looking for an easy condi DPS in raids I'd suggest [condi soulbeast](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/ranger/soulbeast/condition/) or firebrand still.
---
I consider gw2 inventory to be a huge failure.  I think drops should just be the salvaged components directly so you don't have to waste time salvaging.  
---
What you're using as evidence is a solution to a problem Anet made on purpose to create a desire for more inventory space so they could sell you more inventory space.  
---
Also, I know this is nitpicking, but if your gona come at me with a, 'in the past year' statement, you could at least be correct.  Unids are over 2 years old at this point.
---
It aint much but its honest work
---
Running along a rope always results in me falling off one side or the other. They are the babe if my existence. The ooze one was difficult, but I managed after about 10 minutes of trying (seriously). Oddly enough, the game gives me vertigo very easily.
---
Success at actually making it to the top of that pole: 3 out of approx 20 tries. Success in running along the rope: 0.
---
All I see is hating because your opinion is somehow "better" than the other guy's.
---
...and another great theory from you, keep going lmao.
---
Your last post was the “password reset of a free online game is bad” or something like that, right?  
---
If so you weren’t getting trolled by _all_ of the responses.  If you haven’t bought the game yet then there is no serial code.  You just have to wait on support to get back to you from your anonymous ticket.
---
Teleport to a friend gets you anywhere, given you own the expansion/episode.
---
100g is an insane threshold ... that will take over 38,000g to clear off. Just clearing off everything under 10g will cost over 1600g
---
For skins that are available on blue items you can actually buy, unlock and resell since they do not become bound unless you apply an upgrade to them
---
What a stupid comment. Who says you have to use your unlocker now? You realize that you can make gold hand over fist in this game easily and that tool can help you see all the cheap skins and dyes you still have to unlock?
---
I can’t believe he watches this type of this
---
I guess people don't need to buy cloths either, we can all just wear burlap! /s
---
Not OP but I have a few questions if you don't mind..
---
- How "convienient" is AA compared to GW. I really like GW use of the material storage and that most loot is the unidentified gear that stacks. So inventory management isn't much of an issue. Some MMOs I've tried can leave me feeling overwhelmed with the volume of items I have no idea what to do with or I need to constantly be looking for vendors/banks/auction houses.
---
- GW has things like the unlimited salvage tools, extra bag space, extra bank/mat space and shared inventory slots in the gem store, which I'd consider convenience for more long term players who are investing in the game. What's that stuff like in AA?
---
- How Alt-friendly is AA? I like to play many toons with different races/styles/my own made-up backstories. GW makes it easy with account-bound gear and shared inv slots, and leveling isn't that hard. If AA has a high barrier to entry with gear, does that mean I would really only play 1 main character otherwise it would become to expensive/time consuming to gear multiple characters?
---
- What is the "fashion wars" like in AA? Is there a wardrobe system and I can make my toon look however I want?
---
I did the same, and then ought all remaining uncommon dyes.
---
(shrug)
---
I'm pretty sure you can enter HoT on other characters just by walking through the portal in the little cave of Silverwastes.
---
For PoF, have you tried going to the airship in LA? If you don't have the Lily of Elon pass, you can talk to one of npcs there to be transported to the desert, assuming it can work for other characters even if you didn't do the story.
---
Pretty much. When I switched from GW1 to GW2, I expected templates to come with it. After all, it was one of the most useful things they added into lategame GW1, so it made sense to keep in GW2.
---
That we've had to wait 7 years and pay for it now is unfathomable to me.
---
Can't speak too much for PvP but PvE had a lot of changes. [This chart](http://www.nojamtoday.com/upload/guild_wars_2_content_and_feature_update_chart_36.png) covers some of the major changes in each area. 
---
Chrono received major changes, you can no longer shatter without clones, distortion was merged with CS, other shatter skills were reworked (notably F2, now called [Rewinder](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rewinder), gets reduced cooldown based on the number of clones shattered which made [condi boon](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/condition%20boon/) even better and [condi DPS](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/condition/) viable on a couple fights). The [recent patch](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Game_updates/2019-10-01) made [Seize the Moment](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Seize_the_Moment) AoE now so the whole boon chrono meta is up in the air right now since you can cover quickness on 5 targets with 0% boon duration now and hit high DPS or you can go high duration and easily overcap quickness on even 10 targets (by positioning when you shatter) not to mention being somewhere in between and run only alac well with maybe greatsword. I'd wait for things to settle a little bit before reworking things. The "normal" [dueling inspiration chrono](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/mesmer/chronomancer/power%20boon/) before this last patch followed [this general rotation](https://youtu.be/H1154AbvI34) and with diviner aimed for ~65% boon duration (though in good groups you could go lower and when learning you can go higher, even up to 100%). 
---
Weaver builds changed a little in mainly traits and some minor updates. [Power sword](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/sword/) is still very strong and [condition sword](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/condition/) got buffed (a fair amount too). There is a niche condi scepter build and even a meme staff build but not really worth mentioning.
---
[Condi Renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/condition/) got some minor skill changes (mainly [embrace the darkness](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Embrace_the_Darkness)) but remains pretty much the same. [Alacrity Renegade](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/revenant/renegade/alacrity/) is still meta with Firebrand (and maybe solo chrono now but that's not gonna be meta).
---
I could go into more PvE detail (mainly raid in what I listed but could mention fractals too) but I'll stop there for now unless you want it.
---
&gt;what seems to be a dragon
---
[Skyscale](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale)
---
&gt; I haven't started S4 yet
---
You should.
---
&gt; never been to Istan, is it still a thing?
---
In terms of what, a gold farm? They made it daily so you can still do it but it's not a repeatable gold farm anymore.
---
&gt; Don't have a beetle yet
---
Requires doing most of the S4E3 story, Long Live the Lich and then doing a collection. Really not that hard to get especially now that there are guides.
---
&gt; How much gold should I save up for the new mounts
---
41g (or more), beetle is a short collection with 0 gold cost, skyscale is a long collection. Skyscale has 5 parts with a time gate minimum of 3 days plus 8 hrs. You will need to craft or buy a [grow lamp](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grow_Lamp), [skyscale food](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Piece_of_Skyscale_Food) x12, 6g for some toys, optional treats (of which you get 1 free but could use up to 20) I'd suggest just using the free one or none at all and selling it, 35g and 250 of each S4 map currency + 1500 VM and 500 trade contracts.
---
&gt; Is there a "shortcut" getting the dragon
---
No, not only can you not rush it (since you need map currency anyways and it's time gated) but just go through and enjoy the story first. I really liked the skyscale collection but don't try to rush it and burn yourself out please.
---
&gt; I only completed up to Lake Doric from S3
---
I mean, I liked the story and think it's worth playing through at least once and there are lots of nice rewards like free armor pieces, skins, currency, ascended items, etc.
---
&gt; What happened to my gear
---
Stat selectable gear got reset and can now pick from all stats (that you have access to with expansions)
---
&gt; Should I rethink before I commit to anything?
---
Well there was just a patch so builds aren't quite up to date but almost all have changed since you last played so it's 100% worth checking on your builds for raids/fractals, if you have specific build/gear questions let me know.
---
&gt; Were sigil and rune changes as big of a deal as expected
---
The salvaging? I mean it's kind of a big deal, lots of sigils and runes went up in price since supply dropped and crafting most is pretty expensive, it makes using black lion kits on gear with good upgrades extremely worthwhile though. Oh and if you're talking about the reworks they did change a lot, no more hybrid trapper/nightmare setups, thief runes for crit capping, lich runes on some condi DPS, etc. 
---
&gt; Any important changes to the fractals
---
Instability reworks and new fractals (possible just [Siren's reef](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Siren%27s_Reef_Fractal) depending on when you left). [Meta builds](https://discretize.eu/builds) shifted to firebrand/renegade but it's been that way a while now (though the chrono changes pushed it even more).
---
Ty. I've joined the discord as a luker for now as off on holls. Il have a read of rules and stuff when I get back. What time zone do you run on?
---
&gt; - You are playing on their ranking, chances are you are at their skill level. 
---
Normally I would agree with this, but the fact is this game’s PvP scene has such a minuscule amount of players that your uneven matches are created by actual, huge skill discepancies because the game actually struggles to fill up queues.  It’s not uncommon at all for skilled players to be placed with players who are almost brand new.
---
lol
---
Make it happen
---
That norn nailed it :)
---
&gt; Or maybe holo is just broken af and everyone can do it. (July '19)
---
Yeah. You finally got it.
---
&gt; I actually feel..scammed.
---
Well, it's your own fault. There is a preview where you can see exactly what can be unlocked. Nobody fooled you, nobody hid any informations.
---
If you don't want to feel "scammed", if easily can buy all the cheap stuff before using the wardrobe unlock.
---
Accurate af
---
I enjoy the immersion sound gives. The voice parts of the story, the npc's, the music. I just find that particular sound to be obnoxious (even for my own character). Standing in a bank area where one or more people are leveling a character is not a pleasant experience.
---
This is hardly "Griping on Reddit". It is me answering a post with my opinion. You could have just ignored it.....
---
If only this were possible to implement in the actual game, but due to all the spaghetti bolognese in the codebase, and since they'd have to get it to work for all races and all armor classes and also for the Macintosh and it would need to be balanced for all 3 game modes (festival event farming, mount racing, and AFKing in shiny gear) and for each of the elite specs except Scrapper and Scourge, I don't see it happening, unless they figure out how to monetize it in the gem store.
---
Nice concept tho. The gold works well with the blue.
---
Correct, but that's not the point. 
---
&gt; was thinking of a condi build, but it seems kind of unpopular lately
---
looks to be in reference to fractals so I was explaining why not to use condi in fractals, what a good condi would be in fractals if he still wanted to go condi there and then I was responding to the "for people new to condi-based DPS?" question with an easy condi DPS to play (yes not light armor). Not to mention before I recommend SB I suggest out of the light armor options to go mirage as it's a very good meta pick. FB and SB were in the context of "an easy condi DPS in raids" regardless of what gear he had right now.
---
What are we supposed to see here?
---
Ele guard and necro, get away from you, but not thief?
---
Since you're new to raids I'd suggest joining a raid training discord like [Raid Academy](https://discord.gg/mpVnEju) (for NA, [check here](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/) for other options). We have mentoring on RA that you can sign up for to work on your mirage rotation as well. If you can get the hang of the build it's *the* best DPS by far on several fights like Soulless Horror and Twin Largos.
---
This post makes me want to have in-game friends
---
Ah alright.
---
&gt; It's an okay variation from typical "kill X/bring Y", but some activities are of low-to-no enjoyment.
---
Not entirely so, because many hearts do boil down to just kill a bunch of trash mobs and/or bring X items to Y for progress bar. I understand what you meant with variety but fundamentally in both cases the activity of completing traditional exclamation mark quests and renowned hearts is just mindless tedium. And the biggest issue I have with GW2's heart system is that if I'm going to be doing something that's boring and uninteresting, I would rather at least be able to turn my brain off and kill mobs rather than have to read the heart description and search around for some ridiculous items. Perfect example that comes to mind is that fucking awful heart in southeast bloodtide coast with the potions. I have the wiki page with solutions pinned to my discord server still from when I was cursing under my breath at how irritated I was with that one lmao.
---
Basically with hearts I'm either bored, or annoyed while I'm bored. To me I consider it a fail of a system, it's the same thing to me as the typical themepark fetch quests just colored differently.

Firstly is it possible to make racial skills viable/ competitive?
---
And
---
Do all norn shape shifts share a cooldown? If not what class would benefit them the most, if any?
---
Is there any way to get the asura mech to 100% uptime? If not whats the closest i can do
---
Do seed turrets count as auctual turrets for engineer purposes? And is there a way to get its cooldown down to a reasonable level?
---
And free legendaries!

Party members show as blue dots on the map so just zoom out far enough, you can also see what area they are in with the party view on the upper left. As for where things are you just need to learn the basic layout, even just the general regions of [Ascalon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascalon) (Arid, Charr, Branded) [Shiverpeaks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Shiverpeak_Mountains) (Snowy, Norn, Icebrood), [Kryta](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kryta) (Fields/Plains, Humans, Centaurs/Bandits), [Maguuma](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Maguuma_Jungle) (Jungle, Sylvari/Asura, Inquest/Nightmare Court ), and [Orr](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ruins_of_Orr) (Southern island area, Undead). Don't worry about the other zones as you're leveling and getting used to things and even Orr will come much later. Also if you're looking for points of interest or waypoints hovering over any icon in the upper left of the map will highlight any that you're missing, you'll need to be zoomed in enough for them to show up but it's really helpful when you're looking for stuff. You can also shift click on and PoI or Waypoint to link it in chat and you can click on any linked ones to see where they are on the map.
---
&gt; Needed a place to write that down and QQ a bit. 
---
Coulda used an offline notepad
---
Helpful for sure for future builds, however looks like most of the gear is crafted and as i dont have that maxed not as accessible (i checked TP)
---
convenience/storage: you get plenty of inventory space from quests and can buy more for money. bank space is also plentiful and can be paid for with gold/money. you can store stuff in chests on your property. you can salvage gear like in gw. most end game drops are loot boxes that stack and open up into crafting materials that also stack. there is no 'store materials' button however, you'll have to visit a bank in a city.   
---
gem store: previously aa had lots of p2w stuff in the store that would help you with upgrading your gear etc. that has been removed from unchained. you can buy decorations for you house,outfits,mount skins and stuff like inventory and bank space. most gem-store items can be sold on the auction house and you can buy gems for gold from players.   
---
alts:you do not really need alts in aa as you can swap your class in seconds. if you still want to have some for race/style/back-story reasons you can easily do that. there are ways to speed level through labor though that is kind of time gated. releveling is definitely a bit of an investment but also decently profitable through quest rewards and will get faster the more often you do it. dungeon and farmable gear are soulbound while crafted gear is unbound and can be freely traded/sold. so if you have crafted gear and the classes can make use of the same kind of stats on gear you could freely swap between them. gearing different characters with different stats is going to be very expensive unless you're okay with for example focusing on a main and only giving your alts dungeon gear or low grade farmed gear (fine for open world and most pve,not good in pvp) races are restricted by faction. you can only play together with your own faction so I would suggest keeping to one for all your alts. although a character in the other faction has certain  advantages as well - you just can't play with your friends that don't have one.    
---
fashion: definitely many options. transmute system exists though more punishing/expensive than gw2 so you'll probably want to settle for one look. outfits/skins can be bought for money/gold, all gear has distinctive looks. dyes are available too. people definitely care about looking nice https://archeage.mmo-fashion.com/ very outdated and very few submissions but maybe this gives you an overview.
---
Use exotic equivalents, rather than ascended for now. Those can be easily bought on the TP
---
For open world PvE, it's often if not always better to be running a power based build, rather than a condition based build. I'd pick up some berserker's gear (devona's armor is a reasonably cheap version of this). On top of that, you seem to be using axe/torch, which means you're using a power mainhand weapon and a condition offhand weapon. Switching to axe/axe will make life easier in the long run. You can run a condition build, but that means you shouldn't probably be using axe mainhand then, with sword being the better option there.
---
Dno if its still the case (haven't played in a few months), but Condi Mes can rival (or was able to) scourge for raw condi damage, though it tends to be a roamer instead of a bunker IIRC
---
Two separate things:
---
1. While using the Executioner's Axe to run through the last part of Snowblind fractal, an ally knocks him back and stuns him by using the Choya Tonic. This is because while both are used to run fast, the Choya Tonic's mobility skill attacks other Costume Brawl participants continuously with knockbacks, whereas the Executioner's Axe performs its Costume Brawl attack only at the very end of the mobility skill, and you can cancel it with weapon swap. 
---
2. While doing the "bullet hell" phase of Nightmare fractal, an ally left his area to come into OP's area and steal all the healing orbs that OP probably needs to survive. Because the incoming damage is very heavy during this phase, and it appears that this is on Challenge Mode as well, the ally probably killed OP by doing this.
---
Got it, ill buy the devona's set armor. What should i do with weapons, Double Axe and Greatsword is what ive seen for best power setup.
---
Or, I can complain now, and try to prevent a gigantic shit storm from happening.  Because once it's out, they can't make big changes to it.

100g? That's pretty extreme. 10g is probably a more realistic goal that won't cost thousand upon thousands to achieve. Even 1g skews that expected value from an unlock much higher.

Is that the thing that let's you take all the henches along? I think last time I played I had 7 of them. Problem was getting them to use the right skills!
---
There are two variables you have to take into account. 
---
1. Smurfs - Vets who have a low ranking, either because of reset, or because they play infrequently
---
2. People have bad games - Sometimes your particular build or play style doesn't pair well with others.
---
One of the things OP  did was compare this game to LoL. I think it's a good analogy, however there are roles that need to be filled in LoL. Not that everyone picks a particular role, but they try to balance their team build during draft based on enemy team picks and their own team picks. AD Carry could be compared to a guard. Jungler is any roaming class. You're not given that opportunty in gw2, so you might end up with an engineer, 3 thiefs and a damage based ranger, while the opposite team might get a holo, a druid, a guard, a reaper, and a DD. That's just the luck of the draw.

What's even weirder is the collection reward for this is a tshirt that can be obtained through other means

Main issues of GW2 in general.  In PvE it's even more of a cluster.  Thankfully the stakes aren't as high plus most PvE content in this game is just zerging anyway but man this game needs better telegraphing.
---
And I'm pretty sure the site will support template codes, to load them ingame, soon after release.

Honestly I don't really care about a feature that would allow free re-skinning of legendary items. I have literally hundreds (I think over 700) unused transmutation charges, so I'd prefer that scarce development resources be assigned elsewhere.

I'd just like to point out that using LoL, DotA, or other mobas as examples of popular "standing in circles" gameplay probably isn't the best choice for multiple reasons (note: my experience is mostly with DotA, so I'll be speaking from that perspective, some mechanics in DotA aren't in league and vice versa), with the games being generally imo, far more complex.
---
I'll start with the tl;dr: mobas are what you'd get if you reset players to level 1 when they entered a PvP match, forced them to level and buy new items throughout the match, and then when the match is over, reset everyone and made them do it again.  A better comparison might be an arena shooter like quake, or maybe something class-based like team fortress 2.  Why?  Because these games put less emphasis on growing your character and more on your actual skill (not that mobas don't require a lot of skill, but it's a different kind of skill).  I know it still isn't the same, but hear me out for a moment.  In tf2, you have characters (classes) with specific weapons (skills/gear) which you can swap out to counter other players.  It's missing the complexity that comes from having talents independent from skills independent from gear, but if tf2 had armor with stats and talent trees, it'd likely feel a lot like gw2's PvP.
---
&gt;!I know I said that was supposed to be a tl;dr, but I realized after typing it that I don't think I need the original wall of text anymore. !&lt;
---
Edit: since I forgot to actually comment on the point of your post...
---
Your post has made me realize there's stuff I've missed in PvP, however I'm still not totally convinced that PvP in gw2 is actually good.  Not because the idea is a bad one, but more because of how clunky gw2's combat feels to me.  As a player more used to mobas and shooters, gw2's movement and camera feel clunky to me.  I'm not entirely sure what is causing it, I think maybe there's a minor delay between moving my mouse and my character changing the direction they're facing (and maybe objects bullying the camera).  Action cam helps a lot, but not completely.
---
Cost-wise WvW Legendary armor is a decent deal as compared to Ascended. The skirmish ticket time gate doesn't matter if you  play WvW, and the pieces can actually be similar (or even cheaper, for t3) to craft. It doesn't negate your point, but since the major component of WvW legendary are the skirmish tickets, it is an exception to your rule.
---

It's your own fault for not unlocking all the cheap stuff yourself.
---
Its not on the same map, next ep is getting new map, then episode 2 updates on that map.
---
&gt; Do all norn shape shifts share a cooldown?
---
All are at 240s CD and take up the only elite skill slot
---
&gt; If not what class would benefit them the most, if any?
---
Again, most really aren't going to be used in PvE, there are much better options for almost every build. Some have utility in places (like WvW) where you can use the stealth from Snow Leopard or the Charge from Bear (since it has very high scaling damage) but these aren't realistic uses.
---
Corporate shill-speak worthy of EA!
---
This comment made me remember the whole thing around BGDM back in the day. The dude made so much little stuff that should have been in the game since day one, and got absolutely shat on by Anet for it. Things like healthbars before there were any, Grace of the Lands floating numbers before the rework, lots of stuff like that.
---
What disheartens me the most is that both he (Bagdan? Badawan? Something like that) and Delta make stuff that is vital to the game for free and in their spare time. And as far as we know they're not even professionals or anything, just people that love the game.
---
I still don't understand why Anet doesn't just hire a single "Addon" person, makes them make all this stuff that these amazing people are already making for free, and cut 3rd party support altogether. I get this is a company trying to make a profit, but that's a bit too far on the greed spectrum for my taste. But then again, I guess Anet's been getting worse and worse over the years when it comes to that...
---
Sigh.
---
No, episodes 1 and 2 share the same map. Not prologue and episode 1.
---
you can skip the story if you just want to access the map by going to a guild hall in the region. but if you want to do the story, youll have to do the intro stuff
---
As a comm, I can say that the VM and maximum tagging is something to look into.
---
Pressing 1 now, sir
---
Yes, but none of that changes the fact that PvP is a much more repetitive game mode than PvE.
---
[According to the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Basic_Staff_Requisition), you need to trade 250 Basic Elder Staffs to get a Basic Staff Requisition... Does that mean you need 250 slots to hold all 250 staves to trade with?! Or how do you do this?

LOL I do........but playing for 7yrs will do that ;)
---
&gt;Achievements are pointless in this game anyway. They keep putting them in but what's the point?
---
&gt;I mean I still do as many almost all of them anyway, since I'm a completionist
---
Pretty sure you answer yourself there. Achievements are goals to complete. Simple as that.
---
Archeage is a decent game though ^((unlike bless online)).
---
i am getting  error - bad image.

You can actually just get up there with the griffon following the path you usually take with the skyscale.
---
&gt;Anet will release new content
---
that's funny, tell another one!
---
Well GW2 was always going to get new content with the Icebrood Saga but I expect a Bless online type exodus for Archeage because they'll add pay to win to the game. They just want people to play it and think they won't I'll give unchained to January.
---
Did you try just selling the entire stack instead of selling them one-by-one and then screaming at a wall?
---
&gt;  * +1 infusions will become also consumables you can consume to increase account AR from 0 to 10.
---
&gt;  * After that, you'd have to craft +2, +3, etc.
---
So… 10 +15 Agony Resistance Infusion to go from 140 to 150?
---
To get an account from 0 to 150 agony resist, you would need **81,000 catalysts and +3 infusions.** Oh and an extra thirty +1's to make the +2's and also get 0-10.
---
It *would* cost 7,550 gold right now, except **there are only 6,000 +3 infusions on the trading post.**
---
Existing fractal enthusiasts would not have the material or raw gold needed to play the game mode at their current level.

The limit on TP sales is to prevent botting. It's not a bad thing, most situations will never see you hit that limit. 
---
I'm mostly confused on why you're posting greens for sale on the TP with zero buy orders lol
---
Yeah, it's an anti-BOTTING measure. Deal with it. Normal use of the TP shouldn't even trigger this. 
---
Unless you really like to suffer and sell singles of a stack of anything.
---
Also, when you ID Unid greens, you don't sell the greens. You salvage. You either sell stacks of green Unids or you don't.
---
I actually ID them all on the off chance I actually get an exotic out of it.
---
oh damn there is an entire community for photography
---
On Reaper in OW, I like to use Spectral Grasp, go into Reaper's Shroud, and then skill 4. Absolutely shreds trash mobs. With that said, you want to take advantage of trash mobs by not over-capping on life force because you really want to use that life force so you can be in Reaper's Shroud as much as possible as that's where your big DPS is.
---

---
Because (A) I don't have the space to store them until there is one, (B) I don't have the mats storage space either (capped at 500 atm), and (C) I am not at all bothered with mastering buying and selling on the TP to the point I hold on to things forever.
---
If you read my post, I was not "screaming" about anything. I said "I don't get it" and "it's annoying," but luckily some of the people in the comments gave an explanation to help me understand! For the record, not all of us know/understand every single thing about this game.

Are Chak eggs rare? I get them from every meta and chests. Or am I on good terms with RNGods? Also, got 2 chests from last week strike missions (I do one per reset).
---
Or perhaps you should like, slow down and confirm what you are buying before you actually buy it? It doesn't sound like a bug, more like user error.
---
Thanks for that! At least some people are helpful to those of use who don't know everything.
---
Different thing of same name. It's confusing.
---
&gt;"*If you read my post I was not screaming...!"*
---
Oh? Lets examine that.
---
&gt;*Dear ArenaNet... why is this a thing??*
---
Extra punctuation, AKA diet caps lock
---
&gt;*I don't get this. You spam us with unidentified gear that 99% of the time is utter junk.*
---
Accusatory tone.  "*YOU* spam us with gear that is utter junk! (*HOW DARE YOU!*)"
---
nah it's really way too easy to get limited like this, just like getting restricted after sending a whopping 2 mails
---
I know how you feel all to well. I have over 17k hours in the game and have never once gotten a precursor as a drop or any other rare loot after farming for nearly a decade now. The game is not really rewarding in the loot department. You have to play it for content (every 10 months for me now because I usually delve in the raid scene). The development is slow, the processes are annoying, and everything else \*SKYSCALE\* feels like a complete grind for a mediocre reward.  
---
Lets break this down - You spend 15-20 hours grinding an achievement track \*SKYSCALE TIMEGATES OMG\* and then realize that its the slowest mobility ever.. The bunny can out leap it, the griffon can out fly it, and the god damn skimmer moves faster than it over land. You only keep the memory of the 15-20 hour grind for this mediocrity. Congrats, GW2 played you, you didn't play it.  
---
Now on the flip side, lets say you are a completionist, this satisfies your need for finishing things up and 100%ing the game. Lets say you enjoy revisiting old, dead maps with nothing to do on them for any real reward and do things for some achievements. Or you enjoy doing Daily Fractals, Daily Dungeons, WvW Dailies, PvE dailies, HoT/PoF map dailies - you all of a sudden have an inner sense of reward because you did what you enjoy that day.  
---
TL;DR - Playing for material rewards often is anet shitting in your cheerios; the only real reward is found on the 'good feels' vibe you get from finishing what you want to do on a daily basis.  
---
Pardon any spelling or gramatical mistakes, I don't proof-read.
---
The combat in GW2 is better , that's why AA is just a no go for me .
---
Here’s the better way to manage your inventory: 
---
1) Wait until you get a full stack of unidentified gear
---
2) ID the stack (because you said you want the chance of the exotic)
---
3) Salvage the ID’d gear
---
4) Sell the materials from the salvaging
---
This will prevent the error message you’re getting on the TP, as well as letting you play the game more instead of inventory management, as well as a much cleaner inventory. The materials you get from salvaging always have people purchasing them, so you will see yourself getting money quicker as well. Hope this helps.
---
Ok, you win. GG. Not going to argue with someone with such an asinine name.

Chak egg sac* - people who cares about shiny wars are well aware about this infusion, that basically turning you into nyan cat. Rest, like you (no offense) have no idea. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5tcW0nXNqj4 here is the demo with mounts.
---
As for rarity, well, it was added into game with release of HoT, 4 years ago, and it still cost around 15-20k gold on player to player markets. You cannot buy it on TP instantly, there is just none.
---
Resorting to an ad-hominem I see. That's about what I'd expect from someone screaming about something so unimportant.
---
I love that sparkling effect though :D
---
Thanks for the ideas!
