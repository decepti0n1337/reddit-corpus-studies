Or you could have been a bit more caring about your information. Dunno, I have all of my accounts backed up on a doc that only I can access. Useful when you manage 14 different and unique passwords.

---
---
This is exactly my gripe with the GW1 to GW2 transition. The merits of lots of the changes are subjective, i.e. open world vs. instances or quests vs. dynamic events and hearts. But in my mind build craft  is a shadow of its former self. 
---

---
Traits tried to substitute for secondaries and skill diversity, but they're mostly passive effects you can set and forget. Plus, their tiered nature means there's usually one obvious choice out of the three available based on whether you want power, condi, boon support, or healing. 
---
People try to say everyone just got funneled to the optimal FOTM builds, but unlike taking the wrong traits, suboptimal creative GW1 builds were fun! And often viable enough, too. I could play a by-the-books Spiteful Spirit or Minionmancer Necro, but I could also whip out a support one with wells or orders, or even a Meleemancer if I felt daring. So much customizability, effectively lost.
---
PoF has some good looking armor sets. why not try those?
---
"Your face is funny. It's all squished and weird."
---
"No, your face is funny. It's like a little raisin."
---
This rose has thorns. Here they are!
---
if you can't wait for something that originates from your own carelessness I guarantee you'll not really enjoy the game in the first place
---
Given the meta often ends with 5-10 minutes left on the clock if the lanes are being played, they should add a full world boss in the chamber behind the wall that's necessary to get access to the crystalized chests.
---
&gt;However it seems as of late Anet is trying to make base classes a little less bad.
---
Cries as they nerf core Ele to fix Weaver again...

I reccomend taking a look how fractals work on the wiki page. It will anwser a lot of questions about rewards and how agony works. Dont be afraid to start we were all once in your shoes. If you are tackleing a fractal or a biss you dont know let your teammates know. In most cases people will explain to you what needs to be done. I would however advise that you climb to fractal 100 before you start raiding since its a good example of whats to come and how organised play and meta looks like.
---
It would be...pointless. Cause Aurene is Glint's scion aka her key to defeating Kralk. Why would killing kralk without her and then even reviving her be reasonable? That would take her purpose as scion away and only make her seem like a burden.
---
Best table.
---
i've been leading several training runs (be it any raid boss or even fractal CMs) and theres this very weird type of players, the worst of all imo because i just cant figure out whats going on in their heads:
---
after struggling for a couple of tries one player leaves because... whatever - no time to continue, exhausted, grumpy,... you choose. now, theres me, obviously leading the group or even the squad, having this very bright commanders symbol above my head. and after this one player left more and more people start folliwing him. its happened several times that i was left with 4/10 or 2/5 players. upon pm'ing the players that left (not the first one since they usually say goodbye and why theyre leaving) i often see those players kind of confused... "what do you mean 'why did i leave'? i thought the run was over?". and i'm like "how do you think the run was over? it's obviously me leading this run. did you see me saying the run is over?!"
---
now usually i can just invite them and they will join again. but its just so damn unneccessarry and annoying getting everyone back together.
---
pls tell me i'm not alone with this.
---
I like it! Simple yet interesting. Not every fashion wars idea has to be flashy.
---
Have patience. Meanwhile you can create new f2p account to check all the classes and things before you begin to play your original account. :)
---
This.
---
Male sylvari medium armor is hard mode. You got that problem plus every piece of cloth (trenchcoat, buttcape) hanging from your waist floats away from your body like you're Marilyn Monroe standing over a subway grate.
---
Dont call me out like this
---
&gt; Except they don't even do that most of the time, or if they do it's only on the human setup because Charr and Asura have quite a bit of that form of clipping. A lot of it isn't even a "compromise" of slight clipping that isn't noticeable. That's why it's not an excuse for me. They have bad forms of both types of clipping and at this point the more items they add the worse it's going to get so just let it happen because they obviously can't deal with it for the non-human choices and on Humans, Norn, and Sylvari it won't be a hugely visible issue.
---
Everybody would get really bad clipping including human shaped characters. The seam points between pieces is different depending on the armour type. The most obvious one was the waist seam where your leggings ended and where your chest started. Some combinations would clip badly and some would just have a noticeable gap.
---
Where the skirt is attached differs depending on the type as well. Light + heavy has it as part of the legs. Medium has it as part of the chest.
---
This game is guildwars, but dont have a guild wars like others game for example lineage 2.
---
Had medical issues. Couldn't touch gaming for a long time minus occasional games of Fortnite. Phone was stolen, yada yada, wasn't really carelessness but sure. There are so many reasons why someone could lose access to their authenticator then begins the waiting game.
---
Sadly, it wasn't always this way.  They started floating sometime in 2013.

I think I’m kicking a dead horse but I have an idea for you, anet. For free. 
---
In the purple room, have the next plate just on the floor (each person has their own plate). The first person who picks it up triggers the graveling event BUT the gate to the room with the sarcophagus closes (from the inside, outside people can still get in by interacting with the gate like in Cliffside)
---
Now make the Ghost Eater scale with how many people are currently in the room. Like let it be a champ after 10 people. After it’s dead, everyone can leave again. 
---
To avoid trolling give everyone who killed the Graveling an invisible buff that makes you not trigger the event by picking up the plate for for the next 5 mins. 
---
Except it's the exact same issue with the smallest scale/thinnest body norn as well. 
---
Golem is one thing, raids are different. You can do perfect rotation, but miss like a lot of your burst damage because druid forgot to precast might, spirit and glyph, or because chrono didnt cast wells on time or they misplaced their aoes etc etc. You can blame literally everyone because it's group content, everyone makes mistakes, but only dps gets blamed because they didnt reach their benchmark.
---
Even if everyone plays perfectly on individual level, unsynchronized rotations can lead to huge group dps losses. What happens when everyone drops their burst, but buffs arrive 3 secods later, for their auto attacks, filler skills and remaining DoTs/aoes?
---
I do agree that it's obvious to see when someone has significantly lower dps than others (and I'm not even defending those individuals, bad dps is bad dps; there's no excuse for it since majority of dps meta builds nowadays are braindead), but 8k loss on personal level is just as bad as 2k dps loss on 4 people due to bad support performance. Just because it's not explicitly visible, doesnt mean it's not there. 
---
And I'm sorry to say this, but having legendary armor doesnt make you a good player. If it's not the point of this post then why compare poor raid performance with dps benchmarks? What's the point of tryharding for the 2nd lowest dps among damage classes?
---
By season 2 he was already an established character with the thorny hair.  He only has the long white hair in the flashback if I remember right.
---
The only memory I have of Canach in season 1 is busting him out of jail during the attack on LA and for the life of me I can't remember what he looked like.
---
Any Necro can have it, IIRC

New to GW2 Need Help With Choosing a Class
---
I've played this game a little bit got a thief to 80 back when the game first came out. Now I'm looking to start playing again since I can't stand the way World of Warcraft has gone.
---
I'm looking for a class that is very good in PvE, Dungeons, Raids, Fractals, any of the endgame content as well as solo-ability. Since I don't have a guild or any friends that play. I also don't care too much about the PvP aspect of the game.
---
Classes I'm interested in most are Ranger and Warrior, but I do not know what they do in the various PvE content. Like I think Rangers are supports??? I don't even know. Any help you guys could give me would be great, along with any other class recommendations, as well as what they are good at and bad at. This includes Warriors and Rangers, I have no idea what they are good or bad at as well. Thank you for your time and help!
---
There are *so many* loose ends and lost threads now.
---
Late March would be entirely acceptable, I just hope it doesn't clash with the SAB and get pushed back until afterwards.
---
It's not difficult or anything for them to fix it, it's an opportunity cost trade off. Fix armor for other races or make more new content?
---
Can confirm.
---
Both warrior and ranger are good beginner classes, strong in solo content and strong (mandatory "buffers" actually) in end game pve. Ranger has both dps and support builds while warrior is dps with some passive group support through banners.
---
Those multi-boxing tourney accounts for pvp tho...
---
After destroying/activating third crystal in last instance.
---
Not true. WoW demonstrated in WOTLK that it was possible to segregate players on the same map instance with two different views of story progression. You would complete story progression events and appear in a rebuilt village that phased in, and at the same time players with the same progression steps would phase in around you. I always thought that was what Anet was trying to achieve with LS1. 
---
This would be the equivalent of playing through LS1 and the personal story with the original launch Lion's Arch, and only when you completed the destruction of LA mission in LS1 or skipped ahead would you ever see the current LA, and either not have an option to go back or only phase backwards if you were selecting replays of previous chapters of the story.
---
This is exactly how I have felt. I've played GW2 off and on since beta. It's fun. But it's not GW1 fun.
---
1: most classes can, to some degree, fit every role, is just that some are really better than others. 
---
2: Elite Specializations, added with the first expansion are meant to focus the character in a role.
---
Going in specifics
---
Rangers with the Druid elite specialization are great supports, but core rangers and Soulbeasts are both mainly DPS classes. 
---
Warriors are expected to most of the time bring support in the form of banners, but the rest of their build will be focused on DPS regardless of their specialization.
---
Okay this is going too far. This build is about having fun on scrapper and doing *enough* dps. I asked for help optimizing it. Just because it's not rifle thief doesn't mean I can't play it. I'm not joining "dhuum cm EXP only 7bil KP" runs with this. It's about **fun.**
---
I wish they weren't considered upgrade materials... it's really misleading that they might actually add stats. I only did it with one, thankfully, but it left a bad taste in my mouth (I thought maybe there was a bug with stats not displaying or something).
---
The best line of all that - “You weirded out my golem”.  So many great conversations in The Grove. 
---
Thanks! I ended up grabbing both xpacs for $25.  Not bad
---
To be honest, many of the systems for Guilds are the same as WoW.  
---
I don't know to what extent if any that WoW has Guild Halls but that is a big feature for Guild Wars as in the long-run you'll be able to build up one of the three halls with decorations that you can place, there is quite a bit of customisations in the halls but it does take some creativity.  
---
If you plan to raid/do big meta events you can earn a few things towards nice trophies that you can build and show off in the hall as an example, although for me and my small guild it's just another part of the progression and with the size of my guild only really being three we've actually managed quite a lot (close to Lv37 Guild) so don't be discouraged if there aren't many of you to start with.
---
So that's mainly the stuff you'll get out of Guild's - Halls and Guild Missions for rewards that get you some alright thingies. Eventually you be able to create nice buffs/foods and get other free boosters unlocked from the Guild Hall so that's cool too and as you can join up to five guilds at once, I would advise finding a bigger more established guild and use their buffs and such while working on your own guild, you can still chat with everyone in each guild you are in even though you can only represent one of the five at anytime.
---
Hope this helped!
---
Dude looks salty, bet he plays lot of pvp content
---
Here you go. This build is only for open world PVE. I have never done raids, or dungeons. You may want to play with the build until you find what fits you best. I use this build to cleanse condis off me, and swap to daggers to get a little healing boost. With dodges, weapon swapping, one interrupt and For Great Justice giving constant power buffs I have no worries pulling 3-5 mobs at a time. Have fun.
---

---
I don't see why you have to trade-off and like you said its not difficult.  A single mid-level artist can fix these issues with some oversight and by focusing on the worst offending pieces first.  That wont keep their character artists from designing a new armor set.  
---
Twice.
---
So what does "raid viable" mean?
---
Again, these words are just fluff if you don't provide what you mean by it. 
---
Pugs can do lower than 25k dps you are right. **When they use builds that can pull off 33k+ dps**. So if they were using a 25k build, then they'd end up with 16-17k dps in this way, which is not viable at all and they'd actually start hitting enrage timers if all played as such.
---
Good groups 25k dps will be the outliner on the bad side and they'll be carrying your build to reach stuff like no gliding @gorse, mid strat @xera etc. 
---
So 25k dps on pugs is not good, it is not good for good groups either. It is barely okay if you are good yourself and you play with bad ppl. That does not mean viable to me because at that point i could go without trinkets on some classes and call it viable, i could use green gear and call it viable. 
---
I like using mace mace off hand as core warrior because I could start the fight with a stun and the. Swap to axe axe and melt their faces. Pure berserker gear allows you to kill them fast enough usually and when they aren’t stunned just keep side stepping and going behind them. Also could just swap in defense if you really want and that will solve a lot of problems the lazy way
---
I'm not saying we were right to trust her (I kinda buy the whole Glint was really Glaust the whole time thing) but that was the Commander's reasoning.
---
yoo I have basically the same mushroom! mine's purple and female but otherwise the same. like the other guy said, change those gloves up. I use the Profane ones.
---
This precisely why I made a Norn. Never fix.
---
Well from what I understand, uncontrolled wild magic in the world is the issue. See end of PoF and Aurene is able to consume wild magic after Balthazar's  killed and explodes magic. Spoilers I guess, but if youre asking this question I assume you know PoFs story.
---
Point is if Aurene was able to absorb balthazars wild magic (Kralk did this too), it makes sense to believe that Aurene can do it again once another dragon (say kralk) dies with her around. Is this scientifically confirmed by anyone in game? No, but it seems to be the logic the party is using.
---
I've got two (one is a dialogue tho):
---
"There's something in the wateerr... Heellppp!"
---
"- You coming to the practice field tomorrow?
---
~ We'll be there, *cheering for our champion*.
---
+ And we'll toss in a few cheers for you as well.
---
- Ooh, you're terrible" 
---
Considering it was designed to be entry level raid yes. If they wanted to make it harder they'd add another mechanic, like the greens and bombs in 100CM frac, and missing both will wipe the party not just wipe from a single mechanic which would be over punishing.
---
What Anet need to do is increase the difficulty of raids in the game over time so there is a clear path for players to develop their skills and get better and better at controlling their own characters and to operate well as a unit. More challenge modes with extra rewards works to some extent.  
---
The death of the Elder Dragons indeed means the destruction of Tyria...if there aren't replacements to take their spot in the balance of the world.
---
Glint's death and our own killing of Zhaitan and Mordremoth threw the original plan into disarray. Aurene is destined to replace Kralkatorrik as her mother originally was supposed to, but because Kralk got EXTREMELY powerful from Balthazar's magic and consequently feeding on the Mists, shit has officially hit the fan and Aurene's urged to confront him and replace him way ahead of schedule, because time is running out
---
Plate is bugged &amp; is invisible (was for me anyways) walk over to where graveling was killed &amp; you should get a popup &amp; that will be your plate.
---
It's how it works in a corporate environment. Just because you can fix something in under a minute, doesn't mean you're allowed to, for a massive number of reasons. All companies suffer from this.
---
Jahai Bluffs has 6 new armor sets and the last birthday gift had another 3 armor sets, so I feel ANET is listening to this common thought.  
---
I got them without knowing about the snowy effect and am really not a fan. But honestly it‘s barely noticable during day-to-day gameplay. So if you‘re really into the armor I‘d say go for it, regardless of the particle effects.
---
Furthermore, it curious to think what happens the more magic one consumes. If Aurene, a god, or another elder dragon, is there a limit to the magic they can take in? Will one dragon just replace them all and have the magic of 6 + bloodstone magic from a god?
---
I mean, I get it, but so what?  I don't have any expectations for them to change anything we ask for.  Should consumers not complain to companies about their products?  Not sure what your point is. 
---
Nah they are all around buggy in general. I had to log to char select for 10m, relog, dont hit anything except 4 mobs i found together - 10% hp - kill - find 1 more - repeat and i got that &lt;10% health thingy. Before that i probably killed over 100 mobs below 10% and didnt get it (all within 5min of each other or all 5 in 5m tried either way.)
---
They are just really ..broken for some reason.
---
Funniest thing is that's what happened! He didn't have a choya balloon so he asked to be accepted and we said yes and he was so happy. Small balloon choya best choya
---
don't worry about it. In WH40K, the bigger the shoulder pads, the more important you are
---
Aurene managed to eat a few bites before having to nope out. Kralkatorrik ate most of balthazar. 
---
I wish. Been wanting a kid for a while now. But, no. My significant other, aka my girlfriend.
---
you can be level 79 and get to 80 in 1-15 zone and it would take maybe 10 minutes longer than it would being in a 80 zone
---
Yes that's exactly what happens in a dumbed down combat system found in games such as FFXIV where players are restricted in their ability to control their characters properly. By the sound of things needing long skill cast time during combat is just about your limit when it comes to games.
---
It's bugged. You should try to be alone in the room, interact with the sarcophagus, kite and kill the graveling away from its spawn point. If you're lucky the plate will be on the ground where the mob spawns.  
---
Yea, but the fact that she ate any, means she can consume and store magic. Shes so immature I wonder how shes going to hold 6 dragon magics
---
The plan was to kill Kralk and allow Aurene to absorb his magic to avoid catastrophe because Kralk is in the mists eating the magic in it. Since devouring the mists would literally unravel reality as we know it, it would be worse than by magnitudes than the simple natural disasters of a dead dragons
---
It wasn't a retcon, he looked like that at the start of LS1 when the Karka attacked too. He changed his appearance later in the season because the consortium were sending hitmen after him and he was trying to avoid them, and his new look stuck.
---
Edge/10 proving you don't need the phantom hood to look like a necro 
---
this could help a lot with building your warrior in open world https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World
---
The quaggan kid running around the fountain in LA who goes 'hello!' but in a really funny voice.
---
yeah, i dont like condi so that explains that. solo is pretty much what i do most of the time so that's why i don't like warrior anymore
---
&gt; I think it's gotten out of control.
---
Not get around much, eh? 
---
We've got a few active guilds that run almost daily on Dragonbrand c:
---
This is the big thing nobody seems to have noticed.
---
Yep I totally get it!  Everyone rushes to end game so fast in all games, it's ridiculous.  Then they complain there's nothing to do!  LOL.
---
Only two, Gerent from weapon collections and Lobber from guild vendor. There are at least 4 other types of Chak, none of them has a mini, though 3 have a tonic (still, not the same for me).
---
There are certainly some issues. I only PUG for fun so this doesn't affect me that much. In my experience people leave if the group seems hopeless in getting the kill. I don't blame those people. Below some experiences from w1.
---
Consider the situation that some players seem not to know all of the mechanics of the fight and the group keeps rallybotting to the boss without any communication. The situation will not magically get better over time.
---
Or the group might have chosen to do a "meta" strategy that they are not able to pull off but will still try for 30-60 minutes before disbanding.
---
I join those clown fiesta VGs and Gorses almost every week. People come and go and there's a high chance of no kill.
---
Before overhealing VG was a thing people complained that they got unlucky with green circles when the group wiped but truth to be told it all comes down to experience. That kind of group that wipes to every "unlucky" event in a fight is too inexperienced to reliably kill the boss: unoptimal situations will arise. Pair that with no voice chat and low performance teammates you get a frustrating single player experience where you feel like you're selling raids for free. Especially if you already have the LI from the boss.
---
What can be done to fix this situation? Players need to know what to expect from the groups they join. NA has all kinds of groups from Semi experienced to experienced and above. I don't know that well what EU has nowadays as I don't join LI requiring runs often.
---
We did it! Time to go home everyone :D
---
Well. PoE is the only other game that I play with a cash shop. And their expansions are free. And their microtransactions are so expensive that it's never worth it to buy them. People have complained pretty relentlessly about their prices and they've responded that the price point allows their content to be free.
---
It's different here. It's not the price that bothers me. It's what you can buy as opposed to what you can earn. And earning the currency to buy the thing isn't sufficient. 
---
Yuuup. And there was 0 reason to do any of them in Kourna besides the legendary who was an achievement I believe. They really need to work on incentives for doing their content. 
---
Ah, I was probably thinking of the tonics.
---
Agreed
---
I honestly haven't followed too may modern MMOs that came after GW2.  Can you elaborate on some of what is now common in other MMOs that GW2 popularized?  Are events now the new quest replacement standard?  
---
i envy your optimism and fresh eyes. I've played since the first beta and I'm completely jaded by the game... but I'm over 6 years in at this point. I just want to... feel again
---
Gotcha.  Yeah I think, in my head, I'm living in the era where GW2 IS still new an innovative.  I'm well aware of all of those headlines.  Just not of MMOs that have come after it.  I struggle to think of any other game released in the last 3 years except Black Desert Online.  I haven't really heard of anything else.  
---
Lvl 25 thief, nuf said 
---
Wouldnt really call any of those "major" 
---
Its mostly just stories that could be elaborated on based on the ramifications of our actions...which applies to pretty much every part of the world. They cant change/evolve and update everything, thats why we still have 90% of core maps unchanged, even though in a realistic way they should be completely different from launch.
---
I mean... I don’t play the game either but the game has an entire story mode lol.
---
Not every game pleases everyone.
---
Hello :D
---
they are slow af to respond
---
Ignoring the glaring issues in your criticism, just out of curiosity, what game or MMO WOULD you say is enjoyable?
---
I feel like the the magic being absorbed by Aurene after Balthazar died wasn’t enough evidence that Aurene should be able to absorb all the magic from Kralkatorrik. At least not enough time spent explain why we are so sure...it didn’t feel like we were in such a dire situation that we had to try something that wasn’t 100% sure.

But my all time favorite conversation in GW2 is the Norn in the middle of the Maguuma Jungle in HoT 
---
Norn Savage: "Pssst! Pssst!"
---
Your character: "Who is that? Show Yourself!"
---
Norn Savage: "Take it easy, take it easy! And be quiet!"
---
Your character: "What  are you doing out here?"
---
Norn Savage: "What are YOU doing out here?!"
---
Your Character: "Searching for a holodisk. Looks like a giant Asura"
---
Norn Savage: "Oh, one of these majestic creatures took it up into that tree."
---
Your Character: "A Vinetooth? Majestic? Those things are horrific killers."
---
Norn Savage: "No! They're beautiful! My partner and I come out here to commune with them. They've accepted me; I've even petted one!"
---
Your Character: "Sounds like a great way to get yourself killed."
---
Norn Savage: "Nonsense. Roy said they'd never hurt me...outside of the times they've already hurt me. Took a pretty big chunk out of my leg..."
---
Your Character: "Where's your partner?"
---
Norn Savage: "Oh they killed him quick."
---
Your Character: "Okay, good luck with that. Thanks for the info."
---
Quite a complete answer good sir!
---
dig through that email to get the key, that's all you can do at this point if you don't have access to any other information. ANet needs proof you are the one who purchased the game so with them as much as you can
---
I wouldnt change a thing. I love it, glowing hands and all. I understand why some wont like the hands but i think it suits the look really well.
---
Here I thought this thread was going to be on the utter lack of events/anything to do on the map when the metas aren't up. This map feels utterly barren and worthless to me, throwaway content where I won't even find joy on repeat playthroughs happening upon a small event that someone has triggered. It's just the Thunderhead assault and Rox, Braham, and Bottica on the oil fields over and over again. It's like ArenaNet want to create a single-player game where everything happens once, but then also have to throw in massive grinds to pay the bills.
---
Why even bother posting this where people who actually enjoy the game and got past the whole hour and a half it takes to get to 25 will see this? 
---
It’d be one thing if you had constructive criticism but you just rip on it
---
Magical floating armor
---
I see no issue
---
My only issue with outfits is that i can't wear other cash shop pieces.  Especially head and gloves.  I'd be happy with just head.  
---
Wanna talk about Loose ends? Begin with E...

Of camera Bram took a bunch of hyped up norn to go fight Jormag, but they were getting to Jormag's doorstep it got put to sleep.

Have you look into cultural armor? Its unique to your race and armor class especially sylvari gear.
---
For example [this is how my two sylvaris look](https://imgur.com/a/V21aGeP) aside from that i found a lot of great combination by just messing with armor in the bank.
---
Do you mean the lvl, or the class?  I just googled it, and sounds like a lot of people don't like the Thief class.  Maybe I should re-roll.

SWOTR l m a o
---
Hello.World.
---
I'm always pleasantly surprised at how much Anet packs into ambience — voiced lines, sound effects, tertiary character development (even if they're one-offs you never see again). They really do a good job of making the world feel alive.
---
While some lines end up feeling really repetitive over time, there seems to always be more stuff going on if I stay around NPCs longer.

And, as I keep telling everyone as I am camped out at the exit to the instance with cookies and hugs, Glint's gift to us was hope. Now WTF would Glint need to tell us to hope to win against a dragon. We've bagged 2 and a god already. We are like the Queens of overconfidence. Glint told us to have hope because she knew things would end up looking real bad, but it needed to happen for whatever she is cooking up to work.
---
It's always weird when people's argument is, (paraphrased), "Ok, so the beginning sucks... you just gotta keep playing!  Then it somehow gets good!"
---
I remember someone making the same claim about one of the Fallout games, because the person criticizing it had 'only' played for 80 hrs.  Funny, the excuses and mental gymnastics people employ.
---
Thanks
---
How do you lose a city?
---
Actually 4 hours would be enough.
---
Though I've played for a day or two, which is a whole lot more than 4 hrs.
---
New to GW2 and I don't understand the concept of offhand weapons. I can only equip 2 weapons and switch between them so why would I need an offhand weapon if it only has 2 new abilities vs 5 abilities from an alternate weapon.
---
Hello there!
---
its more about the level. everything up until lvl 80 is pretty much tutorial.
---
General Kenobi!
---
I was wondering why I didn't recognize him; I just put it up to not paying enough attention, but if they did change his appearance, that would defintely explain it. Most of the sylvari are fairly humble, in their own weird way, that the arrogant, smart-alek one stands out a bit more. Or at least the more rude one.
---
Yeah, that was weird. I mean, it could always be a band-aid solution, but that both Jormag and Primordious were waking up while we were dealing with Kralk was kinda cool; it gave a whole more urgency to everything.
---
I mean it's always kinda been that way, they just hadn't made a lot of world-class ING story decisions yet. Orr (and much of Core Tyria) is always crawling with Risen despite Zhaitan's demise
---
Then idk how you’re only 25. 
---
You say you've seen every aspect of the game but only got to level 25. May as well complain Pokemon games lack anything to do because you only got to the first patch of grass and quit.
---
Yes early on the story is slow and doesn't hold your hand -- you have to go around and do hearts rather than traditional quests. But there's two expansions and three "seasons" of content (which equal an expansion's worth of story each themselves, roughly), plus the rest of the personal story.
---
GW2 may not be your game, but you have not even given it a chance. The pasta isn't too dry, you just have to let it cook rather than dip it in water for 5 seconds.
---
Zojja. 
---
I'm pretty sure pocket raptors were designed solely to kill dual pistol thieves. 
---
I'd think an entire tree, and I'm thinking Tree like the Pale Tree, is kind of a major deal. At least for Sylvari; there's a world outside what they know, their Dream, and seems to at least be existing if not thriving. 
---
Could you explain “spazzy spam combat“?
---
You'll still get an adequate amount, just not quite as much
---
Weird change of design 
---
Did you mix up the name of Outflanked with something else? That is for being attacked from the back/side which shouldn't care about radius.
---
'Commander, a word...'
---
Actually the floating armor wasn't a problem at launch for charr. Then something changed and it started to float even the armors that were fine beforehand.
---
"Can't see why we should take orders from mice and talking cabbages."
---
i think its fantastic that Netflix brought monty Python back into the spotlight.
---
you need to do the same with ele as the wizard named tim.
---
upvoted
---
TLDR; I'm level 25 and I feel I know enough about the game to publicly critique it. 
---
Most MMOs by level 25 are boring quest hub experiences of kill ten rats to get to the next quest hub. This is refreshing by comparison.
---
Of course some people need a bread crumb trail and everything fed to them on a silver spoon to get the game. That ain't this game.
---
I don't see as many loose ends as you do, though you're correct on some of these, namely Malyck and his tree / the promised army, and the Nightmare court. It really is a shame that these two things have been cut from the expansion, though the devs remain interested in exploring both topics, and apparently Matthew Medina (iirc) is interested in realizing some sort of idea in regards to Malyck, though we don't currently know what it is. 
---
Regarding the rest of the things you mentioned: I wouldn't call those loose ends, but one could say they are missed opportunities. The way the expansion content is designed, once the expansion and its respective living world season(s) are over, you can fully and utterly know that none of these places will be returned to or built on over the course of the storyline.
---
It never bugged me much, but now that you mention it, it IS a bit of a pity in places. 
---
Reaches lvl 25. Speaks like they know the entire game.
---
You can equip up to 4 weapons, a main hand and offhand combo, and a mainhand offhand combo. Or you can equip 3 weapons, a two handed and a mainhand offhand. Or 2 two handed weapons.
---
So about the Chak...
---
I'm like 99% sure the intention is that rift creatures are the ancestors / genetic cousins of the Chak. I doubt we'll get more information on them as a whole, but so far it seems like they're ideal subjects for dragons to corrupt because they feast on magic. They avoid elder dragons instinctively, but they're not immune to corruption. Whereas the chak are a more primal version, the rift creatures seem to have evolved to be much more adept at channeling the magic  they consumed.
---
I doubt we're going to see much about their origins or place in the universe, though. Probably just a generic "these are bugs that live in the places between worlds" kind of thing.
---
You can equip two "weapon sets", not two weapons. A weapon set is either a two-hander or a mainhand+offhand. So 5 abilities per set either way.
---
Go into your Hero panel[H] into Equipment and look at your weapons to see you have four total usable weapon slots. It's a lot more intuitive for newcomers to drop and drag into here instead of directly from inventory to see visually what you have equipped.
---
Er, when I said radius, I meant the flanking range. I'll change that real quick. Oops.
---
Don't say "we probably won't" until we're through with a Depths of Tyria expansion and corresponding living world seasons... they might be down there! :P 
---
ohh no problem, I just wanted to ask to make sure haha

Sylvari don't get awakened into Mordrem in the same way that other creatures are with Zhaitan's magic.  They can't. Remember, they are immune to any other corruption that is NOT Mordremoth's.
---
Same reason they can't get death-branded or branded. Can't get into more detail for obvious reasons.

yeah, when I did thunderhead after posting this it took like 40 seconds to a minute at 1 point

Angle :)
---
It's been brought up a few times the past few days, the most recent one 18 hours ago. https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aftqy3/any_news_on_the_invisibilty_bug/
---
Please add to the discussion there. Deleting this as a duplicate post to keep things tidy :) 
---
Yes, but /u/gw2fu is correct. If you have the Light of Deldrimor buff, you can port into the green room (I used a teleport to friend) and find the hidden chest with the serpentine jewels, even if you haven't completed the other parts of the mini-puzzle. I was forced to do this today due to getting the graveling room and farming for 20 minutes without a plate drop. 
---
Well, you can't really tell when they're invisible.
---
Sorry all, deleting 
---
At least you can play with the griffin during the dredge adventure but I agree man where’s my griffin races.
---
No problem, sorry about that. 
---
They weren't any born like that. Devs have stated that all Mordrem Guard are Sylvari turncoats.
---
In my experience, the plate is always invisible but it doesn't always spawn. I was walking over, around and through the dead body pressing F with no luck. Based on what I saw today, it seems to only spawn for one person (randomly, not the person who triggers the attack). 
---
actually, could joko have awakened sylvari? he wasn't using dragon voodoo...
---
all good! :) 
---
Thread removed: Spoiler(s) are not allowed in titles, feel free to re-post this without the spoiler in the title.
---
The angle gave me aids 
---
1. Istan farm and AB are also very profitable.  
---
2. It's the only way.  
---
3. It's used for open world, but there's better weapons for group content.
---
&gt;Then that's very subjective, isn't it.
---
I think that went without saying? I'm personally always predispositioned against cash shops. I want the game to thrive. But I don't want it to cost aspects of the game. I'd like to earn a mount skin by doing achievements. Or have mount skins be a low %chance reward from something. I don't want the ONLY option to be the cash shop. I want to earn things.
---
&gt;  I just dont like all the flashy gear
---
*wears chaos gloves*
---
I think this is it. Every one of our allies (and former foes) who came to the forbidding Thunderhead Peaks came there only to fight Kralkatorrik and then leave again. There is little to no reason to establish a permanent foothold in the area, as there is no peaceful populace that the Order would seek to protect.
---
(Assuming the Dredge and Zephyrites don't really interest them.) 
---
It stands to reason that the Order also established a bounty board on the Sandswept Isles, but first of all, this was at a time when the local Olmakhan were promising allies against Palawa Joko and the Inquest, and second, we have no idea whether the unplayable remainder of the island might be relevant to the OoS in some way. 
---
(Though I doubt this possibility will ever be explored.)
---
What I think: 
---
At some point during the development process, when everyone was already busy af, someone went: "Hey, we can't really use the regular bounty boards voiceline here, we could change it to "wicked, ley-enhanced creatures are roaming the peaks"... wait, how much lore sense does this even make?"
---
 
---
And everyone was like "Nah, leave bounties out, we're not calling the VA in for that and it doesn't make much sense anyway."
---
Yes! There were a few of them among the Free Awakened in the last mission of episode 5. Your conversation with them starts with "how did this happen?!"
---
During Flashpoint, when we prevent Balthazar from using the machine, we were next to Primordius, but it was also affecting Jormag, so I think there's good reason to think he calmed down too. 
---
I personally like "slippery slope". I completed a pug cm 100 with no much trouble while also having fun. Like "stick together" (that u praised) it also forces you to do minimal movement and stop running like headless chicken. When u manage to play like that it feels to me really rewarding (not in a sense that gives u something back cause it doesnt). Now, in some fracs where u need to go from A to B (no fights in between) the various terrain can really fak u up but i dont really mind the small delay since its not in a fight. I agree that this insta prevents even the best players to speedrun but it compansates with laughs..
---
I lost all interest in E after we discovered that he was just another part of the Krytan royalty drama. 
---
Nothing in the game suggests any of that at all. And we see chak and mordrem fighting multiple times. 
---
The fact that adoption licenses already cover an ice-themed set of mount skins, along with wintersday mounts, is even more of a reason that we have enough snowy skins in the game.
---
- Nightmare Court and Chrysanthea was supposed to be explained in Dragonstand in a 4th lane that got cut. 
---
- It's fine keeping possibilities for more at Rata Novus.
---
- Gorrik made us get Chak stuff from the anomaly in Jahai, could lead to some stuff. 
---
- Agreed, but it's very far away from the current story theme sadly. 
---
- We returned to orr in Siren's Landing and got futher developement on Risen, maybe if we ever go back to the Jungle. 
---
All good, title is intentionally vague.
---
I'm about to get in to raiding. Going in as a boon support chronomancer. What is the best stat set / combination to use? I heard if I do all commander's, then I'll most like be the tank as well (which I don't necessarily want to do since I'm new). Is there another build that will provide 100% boon uptime, but maybe do either more dps or healing than tanking?
---
Thanks thats good to know at least it was working at some point. 
---
Agreed!
---
Maybe their finger slipped.
---
Max out elite specs to 3 is ideal imo. Each profession would be complete with a support, damage, and control-oriented profession.
---
I mean...that's mean. Clearly plenty of skill and it's overall nice
---
But yea the angle was weird. Tiny legs and feet didn't help imo.
---
Commissioned?
---
no :) you imply have to note that in raid you find always the same group of people, with lfg I mean
---
Aye aye captain
---
He looks really good tbh. Can’t say I’d change much.
---
Nice work, Michram!
---
" Don't let the creature get away.  Up the tree, quickly ! "
---
" No need. It's dying ! We got it ! "
---
Not sure it belongs in this category though, as it is a cinematic.
---
That was the style I was going for. My more recent ones are slightly different, bigger feet and actual hands. But that's a style I work with! As for the pose, well I took inspiration from Death Blossom and Impaling Lotus from the Lotus Training grandmaster Daredevil trait!
---
I’m on TC; our population can be busy still!
---
People liking something doesn't mean its engaging. Action fast pace combat, fast enough to elicit urgency of response, but not too fast to be outside of human capabilities. This is engaging. Its not simply whether something can hold your attention and preference. 
---
The whole argument has been GW2 does this better than any other games. And many players who can't quite handle the "twitch-reflex" often never train to get better even though they are capable of it. And then then prefer slower combat styles as a result. This may or may not apply to you specifically but the trend is there. You're basically asking me for a more politically corrects response to things, to which i will not oblige. I will simply call things out as they are.
---
The little bubble butt in the first pane. 😍
---
You want to jump-start Aurene?
---
I don't like that you criticize a few of them for "punishing playing correctly". If the "correct" play makes things worse, then it's not the correct play. 
---
She got places to be, girl!
---
1. It's definitely still a thing, but Istan seems to be the big hot thing right now. You'll need to buy the first episode of Living Story Season 4 to access the map, though.  
---
2. There's several ways to get PoF mastery points: Story Completion, Mastery Insights (like Hero Points) and yes, Achievements.  
---
3. I think Power Warriors use Axe/Axe Mace/Mace for most instanced content but I think there are situations where GS is fine, plus in open world you can do whatever you like.
---
Just an observation but I've noticed a lot of bailers tend to be chrono's. That's because they know they have the luxury of being the most in demand class for raids. If a dps leaves it's no big deal as you usually get a replacement pretty quickly. But waiting for a chrono, especially a tank late at night can be tiresome.
---
slippery slope isn't bad. some players are. ironically they are the vocal ones who go on reddit to make rants about it, while most of ppl i know just don't really seem to be bothered by it.
---
it doesn't take away control without counterplay. it makes the control slightly harder. all you need to do is adjust your WSAD and camera movement. dodge resets the sliding, and in 100cm/normal when you jump with low gravity you also regain all control. me and my static ran the 100cm with slippery 3x in a row and it never made the runs any different, except it was fun to slide. 
---
also we bleed fire has easy dodge telegraph, can be projectile blocked, sometimes doesn't even hit you, and if you kill the trash mobs before the attack winds up it doesnt happen. and if you blind the mobs then it misses. seriously just try improving first or getting used to sth new, because this is swampland rework whining all over again
---
Heh, still counts!
---
Please say "a lost city."
---
Is it my charr or my warrior that's so slow when moving?
---
Broadly agree with the tiers here, though I am very fond of Mist Convergence. We Bleed Fire feels like a missed opportunity - having it trigger less frequently but be more of a big deal feels like it would push you towards skilful use of projectile defense, and if the missiles actually dealt damage when reflected that would be a nice reward too.
---
I feel like Slippery Slope is somewhat salvageable, but I can't see it ever being interesting so honestly I just think it should be removed. The effectively arbitrary way it ruins certain skills is unacceptable and there are far too many places where optimal play requires very fine control over your movement. The idea that this instability will eventually be combined with SA is horrifying.
---
I like revenant, since it's a jack-of-all-trades, master of fucking **all of them.**
---
Just not at the same time.
---
What the actual fuck is your problem. Seriously.
---
How insecure do you have to be to not only put down other people's opinions, but also use their opinions to INSULT THEM, OVER A FUCKING GAME?
---
POLITICALLY CORRECT? THIS ISN'T FUCKING PROCHOICE VS. PROLIFE. IT'S A GAME. A MEDIUM OF ENTERTAINMENT. IS TALKING WITH YOU ALWAYS THIS "FUN" OR WILL I BE ABLE TO DEDICATE MY HOURS AT THE THERAPIST TO SOMETHING ELSE?
---
Please explain how having Soulbeast using "Charge" or "Hilt Bash" or "Kick" occasionally sending them slowly through the enemy without doing damage, "Serpent's Strike" sending you off to the side instead of around the enemy, "Hornet Sting" and "Monarch's Leap" not actually moving player position, and that's just on Soulbeast- please explain how those aren't "taking away control without counterplay".
---
I'd also like to point out I never said We Bleed Fire was too hard- nor do I think I'm whining. I just said it was unfun due to unreliability of its effect.
---
okay, so me and my wife both own copies of the game and are looking to get back into it. I remember my account info but she does not and wants to recover her account. The two physical coups got mixed up and we are not sure who's is who's. Is there a way to find my serial key in my account so she can recover her account?
---
Slippery slope is not bad. But anet need to make it work on uneven ground the same as on flat ground (that you dont keep sliding).
---
Outflanked is more of a problem because 1 shot mechanics are not fun. So need anet to tone this one down a bit.
---
There's also the rest of the "old generation" gods that might try and step into the power vacuum left by ours. Sure, we've dealt with Dhuum, but there's still Menzies, plus whoever else.
---
Or maybe Lys and Ilya split at some point, with one voting against Balthazar and the other secretly helping him?
---
its like 3-4% less. Honestly, wen I grind levels, I go to extremely low level zones where everything is 1shotted even with level scaling and just destroy movs with xp boosters. Can take me around 10-12 hours for 1-80. 
---
ah. I'm here comparing my full-height charr's speed to my much shorter than average human's speed and I'm like "for a feline on all fours he moves pretty slowly."

What about the fact that the entire sylvari being dragon minions is never a factor in season 3 vs primodus or jormag and path of fire/season 4 vs kralk?
---
If the other dragons gained the death ones abilities then the remaining dragons should all be able to control sylvari.
---
&gt; What are Mordrem up after their daddy bit the dust? Honestly, would love to see some inner power struggle and some Mordrem mentally reverting into their pre-corruption state and support our work against other dragons.
---
So we do have some insight into this, primarily surrounding the Mordrem Guard though.
---
During Eir's Memorial, Rox mentioned that mordrem are going crazy now that they no longer hear Mordremoth's voice anymore (I suspect she was mainly referring to Mordrem Guard, who were not technically corrupted, thus still had some free will). Later on, during Festival of the Four Winds, we had [Solitary Sylvari](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Solitary_Sylvari) show up, who was a Mordrem Guard, showing that at least some of them have reverted to their old selves physically, while suffering mental issues due to the whole "I succumbed to an Elder Dragon's lures" situation.
---
More repeatable content? What? 
---
Theres a ton of grinds already, you want more? More repeatable content? You cant repeat what is there already enough to satisfy you? 
---
Or are you just complaining that you want more types of repeatable content? Thats understandable. 
---
Elite specs are huge for the population of this game. An expac without them would be hard to sell, peope expect and enjoy them alot. 
---
I believe if they dont put anymore elite spec(or another way of giving me new options for combat) then theyre going to hurt their sales. 
---
I mutter this under breath to my boss, when they overwork me to death. Those plebs have no clue what I am saying obviously. 
---
I actually think it's problematic that map completion is expected to be a no effort thing. For most people, they play the story, then complete the map in a space of 2 hours and complain that there isn't enough content, because they skip the achievements. I actually prefer games that require you to do a lot to get to secret parts of the map and 100% the area. It might not fit in guild wars 2, but I think gw2 is worse for it.
---
When commander is frequently seen playing condi banners and uses “I bring team support” as an excuse to pull 7k dps on Sabetha lol
---
This is just as obnoxious and disrespectful to the group as a dps player pullling 1/3 their benchmark in an experienced group.
---
Base warrior and guardian might be doable
---
"Seek and you shall find !"
---
Caladbolg can be stat swapped at the sylvari who remakes it for you for 1000 unbound magic.
---
Mists Convergence was definitely a "high okay" for me. It's generally really fun!
---
Last Laugh I put in "Okay" mostly due to the irrelevance of its "stun to prevent explosion" effect. I think in general, most people have gotten used to playing with Last Laugh, but having a bit more possible counterplay would have been fun.
---
We Bleed Fire is for sure dependent on team comp. If you're running with a druid or otherwise dedicated healer, it likely has no impact. The damage is actually quite significant if it's not immediately cleansed or healed.
---
I admit I may have judged that one too harshly based on my own group's playstyle- losing scholar bonus when you thought you were positioned correctly because the boss decided to instantly face another direction mid-cast feels really bad when you don't have a dedicated healer.
---
Slippery Slope's main issue comes from skills with built in movement. The slipperiness messes something fierce with those, even on stationary bosses.
---
And Boon Overload is for sure a "low okay". It's mostly in okay because it's basically "you take more damage"- I view it in the same terms as I do Afflicted and We Bleed Fire. If you get hit, you're gonna take more damage. It definitely stacks up though.
---
W E  G A H T  I T

I think it looks awesome. It's like you have aethereal or spiritual energy emanating out of your hands.
---
1,279 matches in unranked, 608 wins. i'm not too worried about win/lose ratio especially in unranked where you have plenty of room to practice so it's ok to lose.  
---
i come back to spvp scene after a long time after my friends win trading and that put me off big time. 
---
my ranked matches, 1,448 played, 718 wins. i'm a plat player. and probably practice some more to get to top 250. was just a bit rank points away but i didn't get online much around end season. so yea. don't let anything, and especially a number puts you off if you enjoy playing. 
---
A npc has no mind.

Your weapon skills are this with no weapons : xxxxx

With offhand only its this : xxxoo

GW1 nostalgia but yeah. Point taken I suppose. 
---
Kind of just semantics: my main point is that PUGs don't want to play it and that's probably not going to change without the instability changing.
---
it's where everyone starts off 
---
when i started my spvp. I got stomped   ....  everyone yelled at me  how bad i was .... ( now i yell instead ) 
---
it's kinda bad but if you like pvping   it's the process everyone has to endure
---
now i'm plat 2 Eu. with around 60% winrate. 
---
the key is admit that you suck and stop making excuse or blaming the team 
---
( that's what many people are doing these days  especially Gold people ) 
---
you will eventually get better ....  ... well for most people i know...
---
one of the key is work on your 1 v 1 skill. if you can 1 v 1 you can adjust to anything.

Great story and advice, I definitely agree with you.

The fact that you don't enjoy doing this efficiently doesn't mean others also don't.
---
This game only gets worse and worse with character fashion.... Unless you play fucking human.
---
on the real tho, fuck space marines. xenos is where its at. 
---
&gt; So every single Mordrem we come across was Sylvari? I guess I missed that part. Or is it just a specific set of them, since this seems to imply it's just the guard.
---
No. Dunno where you got that from. I think some of you are confused as to what the difference between a Mordrem and a Mordrem Guard is.
---
Mordrem are Mordremoth's natural minions. That one he creates. That includes the Pale Tree, who's a cleansed version of a Blighting Tree. Blighting Trees are used to clone living creatures into twisted Mordrem versions, which are made out of plant material just like Sylvari.
---
With Zhaitan's magic Mordremoth then created the blisters. Blisters are used on corpses with which he than clones into Mordrem. Mordrem Wolves are an example of this or anything that looks like another animal, hylek, itzel, nuhoch, dinosaurs, etc.
---
Now, Mordremoth also has the Mordrem Guard. These creatures are all exclusively Sylvari. They are those who's wills were twisted and corrupted into following Mordremoth. 
---
Because Sylvari are beings of the Dream, their true nature is of mind. That is why he's able to make perfect clones of his most powerful Guard, the ones you fight in Dragon's Stand multiple times. He's able to not only clone their bodies but he's able to safeguard their minds and transfer them back into a new body.
---
The actual origins of Sylvari are up for debate because none of the other trees create them, except for one other, a mystery left hanging. Mordrem Guard aren't grown or created. Only turned and corrupted.
---
Oh traits that interact with steal also interact with deadeyes mark?
---
Yes definitely. I just did the sword one last night, and that did confuse me why there wasn't a tracker for the kills
---
Where did you learn to swim? Did a rock teach you? Quaggan thinks it must have been a rock.
---
Is there a way, you can duel or 1 vs. 1 in GW2
---
Love that scene
---
Don't expect to get that sorted out anytime soon. As long as it's not game-related, you'll be hanging by a tread for a long time. Harassment, cyberstalking and matters that might have a negative impact on your life outside of the game hold little to no consideration in Support's eyes
---
*^(From a player who has been struggling with similar issues for over a year now.)*
---
They do if the event is running. I destroyed eight of them on Saturday on to finish off the achievement.
---
Guild Wars 2 has one of the worst **Customer Support** services out there for the western MMO market... especially when it comes to these past two years.
---
Yes and no. SOMETHING was supposed to grow there, yeah and THAT was of Mordremoth but something clearly changed. The Pale Tree became the Pale Tree instead of a Blighting Tree and the Sylvari became what they currently are. They have a connection to Mordremoth but they definitely are not the same creatures he originally created.
---
My theory is that something else was supposed to grow there, like the Husks or Mordrem Hounds (which actually do but are called Fern Hounds). And that particular THING became the Sylvari largely in part due to the Pale Trees imprint by Ronan and her connection to the Dream gave the newly created Sylvari souls.
---
Thus they are of the dragon and were created by him in a sense but they're not what they originally were meant to be.
---
Second on head to the Silverwastes (west of Brisband Wilds). Learn to survive and kill every Modrem monster type their. Don't worry about being META, just survive and kill them.

Precisely

LOL my friends and I started that, we were afk in the mistlock waiting for raid reset and people started joining the line. We started on the black triangle at the edge and moved to the bridge to make room, it was actually full at some point (I took screens but they're low quality cause I play on a potato). It was really cute :)
---
Seriously, ever since the first patch I have ridiculous amoun of crashes, at least once maybe twice in a meta, especially north
---
And yesterday I just jumped around with my raptor in the dredge village and crashed. No meta running at all. Closed down the game for good and decided to come back only once they explicietly tackled this issue. I want to enjoy that map, man :(
---
Not their fault Anet tied ultra-rare precursor-level items exclusively to them.
---
You can go " Custom server "   look for the name  Duel / 1 v 1 something along those line.
---
That's where many people train.
---
Although... Map completion could help you craft ascended, because of the amount of money you can get by "selling" a gift of mastery.
---
At the time it was a couple hours in. I have seen a lot of people saying the same thing about the time frame, so I guess I play the waiting game...
---
Nice troll. 🐟
---
&gt;While we got some expansion on the way Chak work, their species has been left out for the most part, despite the fact they are damn interesting. Would love to see Chak Queen world boss someday.
---
They are creatures of the deep that feed on ley line energy. I have a feeling when we will pay primordous a visit eventually they and the dwarfs might have to play some role.
---
you're not alone but you're also still a minority boycotter so 🤷
---
To me Slippery Slope is one of the best instabilities they made, it's not hard to deal with and it shakes up the gameplay a bit... And after all when you're all fighting a boss it's not very different from Social Awkwardness 
---
I don't get the position. That and the abstract background confuses me.
---
You god damn idiot. Really?
---
That is just because people have learned how to handle the event and true for quite a few worldbosses. This used to be the hardest event in HoT after launch(it also got tuned down along with everything else).
---
usual stuff.
---
Well I'm not having an issue with an invention build with hammer scrapper in open world.

Really? Sending me hate messages and insult me on my own subject  *just* just because I'm giving my own opinion? 
---
Nice. I give my own opinion and people insult me. 
---
Forward momentum shouldn't stop dead on a dismount either.
---
You mustn’t have been around during Season 1. By updating all the maps, you essentially lose all the story that was originally built in to that map.
---
They rebuilt the world and old maps with new stories, which was good at first, but you know, you don’t get those back.
---
The maps are designed to also portray the part of the story they are set in. They’re easier to maintain that way, and teams can work at developing new areas.
---
I prefer it the way it is now tbh. 
---
Try compare it to WoW’s instancing, but, honestly, their instancing is honestly trash.
---
Anet said there are no more underwater legendaries. So sorry for you.
---
Hmmmm ok, guess I need to afk in that area for longer then and wait for the event to spawn
---
I'm not talking about scrapper in this context.
---
Try to dodge if you get gooped by awakened that should probably remove at least Slow+Cripple. And for the other condis be careful of the corruption zones.
---
&gt;  I would put Dragon Hunter above core guardian for power damage because they burst harder, they just can't sustain that burt.
---
Can this meme just die already, dh has been better than core guardain in both aspects for months now, why do people keep repeating it?
---
&gt;2. All Warrior specs are fairly equal for power damage because the core weapons were buffed properly. In this case, the elite specs add options to what's available without completely overshadowing it globally. (properly implemented)
---
Power Berserker is *definitely not* equal to core or spellbreaker.
---
&gt;5. Core Thief power is completely eclipsed by the Daredevil in the name of speed and more direct tactics. When you're running around alone, you don't have the opportunities to keep reapplying stealth for the sneak attacks the way you do when somebody is holding the aggro for you. When you take that away (open world) the core theif loses almost all of it's real damage potential. Deadeye takes the core Thief and gives it a good ranged option but you're still basically back to core thief if you do melee weapons without a group. For a while, DE put DD into the dirt on damage because it brought the ability to get those stealth attacks with your melee weapons when playing solo but that's all been taken away. :(
---
DE has *never* eclipsed DD in open world and it can still use stealth attacks solo... Thief is literally the class with the most ways to apply stealth to itself.
---
this is most recent stuff about chrono: https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/afeinu/chronomancer_rotations_uptimes_patch_08012019/ you might wanna wait for https://www.snowcrows.com/ before you decide. https://discretize.eu should be updated soon too.
---
just cus you like it doesnt mean everyone that doesnt like it doesnt get it
---
youve got to admit that slippery slope is objectively different from most other instabilities, and then maybe you can see that theres people that just dont like playing ice physics simulator instead of fractals
---
No clue why they kept flux bomb... was never fun .. will never be ...
---
The damage modifying ones are the ones I like the most .. they make it harder but if you play well you are fine 
---
But I ageee they can be crucial if stacked
---
We bleed fire is actually not too bad ... maybe combined with outflanked it can be annoying
---
Birds.. who hat that idea at anet ... damage ok .. but blind .. no tx
---
So and slip slope ... would be nice if not that crucial... maybe bit less sliding...
---
You cannot really fight on uneven ground
---
No matter what profession or build there are instances that can be difficult to win and enemies in open world that literally cannot be defeated alone. However professions like warrior, guardian and necromancer can make those fights a bit easier. Also I recommend you to pay attention to getting good gear, something like full exotic should be the minimum you have when you go to HoT.  
---
I'd like to share my insights about the training issues. Sometimes the group is semi-experienced at mechanics and only train for *new roles.* It's completely different from a progression group from the ground up where the newcomer would know jack shit about the encounter. If that group has been there for 2 hours, they would not have time to spend another 30 minutes to teach mechanics, doing right runs, etc - literally invest in a pug that potentially vaporizes after 2-3 pulls. 
---
While maybe not the fastest or bursty, Minion Reaper will braindead faceroll whatever content you throw at it. If it can die, it eventually will.
---
Wiki has some details on it:
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience#Mechanics](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Experience#Mechanics)
---
Scrapper is raid viable. But only for wvw raids.
---
I always do these achievements during Thunderhead Keep meta. It went over so fast before the end boss that I don't bother checking the progression.
---
Ty~
---
I assume this is just on the bigger body types?
---
Power axe/gs reaper is by far the best all around solo class atm. Completely overpowered, no downsides (lacks good ranged aoe damage maybe?), extremely easy to play. 
---
&gt; with ending s5
---
We are still at s4 tho. THat might be a problem. 
---
im guessing it is to take advantage of the trait quick pockets in trickery, which gives you 3 initiavite when you weapon swap, putting your weapons that way lets you weapon swap without changing your skills
---
They did seem to fix this, though now the crystals seem to spawn without the event, and bug out :(
---
Yeah the fact you have to be there before it starts is very lame
---
I found a lot of the other events have good character, they just don't spawn enough, or with enough notice range to attract attention. 
---
You only need to equip the shield, whatever skills you use to kill the mob don't matter. I do it with my chronomancer during THK meta. 5 minutes into the defense event, I got all three popped up at the same time. This method took the least effort for me, and have been working consistently for my other 4 weapons as well.
---
By Ogden's hammer, what savings!
---
I still hope for Baubless :(
---
Mostly in the right ballpark from my observation although I'd swap some of your ok and great list (I think No Pain No Gain is amazing) but I disagree regarding Social Awkwardness.
---
SA is as annoying as it was before because it leads to direct negative consequences for me due to someone elses action - getting pushed out of the safe zone on 99cm is not fun at all if you are currently channeling axe 5 on a soulbeast - before, I could trade some hp for damage if someone was bad at positioning. Now, I have less control and I dislike it even more than before because exact positioning is something I enjoy this game for. Yes, this is subjective and yes, I hate that Anet is cutting into the best parts of its combat - benefits from cooperation and active damage mitigation.
---
Ah, I must have somehow over looked that trait. I'm still 40 HP away from unlocking deadeye so I guess this is to somehow help unload? Going to assume it takes initiative to cast, therefore making it spammable?
---
I cOuLd OuTrUn A cEnTaUr!!! 
---
there, i "corrected" the sentence
---
Turn the volume up to max when you watch the video. TOTALLY WORTH IT. Also these have been in game for a long time. Hope they fix it soon. They have known about them for some time now :/
---
1) how the bloody hell, do you sell a gift of mastery. 
---
2) the question was "do i *need* to", not "does it help"
---
Slippery Slope is, in concept, how all of the top-tier instabilities should be. It changes the way fractals are played and makes them difficult to approach with only one strategy in mind.
---
That being said, you pointed out why it doesn't work in practice. Because of the way the physics engine behaves, skills with a movement component are impacted by the change to friction in unpredictable and buggy ways. This is a clear engine limitation, not an intended design choice.
---
Pretty sure thats just a picture of vantablack.
---
I think it should be a stacking buff that goes up to say 5 over water and starts dropping off over land. Also it shouldn't drop while you use the lift action, so you can coast over land going fast for a short time.
---
That way it would slowly ramp up over water and you'd be able to maintain the max speed over short stretches of land.
---
can't tell if it's the abyss or the void
---
Its the reapers hood which is unlocked through completing the Reaper elite specialisation.

Recently playing with 4 new players in my guild. When they started they were horrible. No map awareness, not using the right skills at the right moment, no idea what attacks to dodge and wich you can take etc. But they became pvp rank 20 already and we've even done some ranked in the last season.  
---
I see them improve! they are looking at the minimap a little more. They are learning wich class can do what skills and wich of those they need to dodge. and overall their gameplay has improved wich carries over to other area's aswell like fractals.
---
If all you care about is open world performance, then every class will have a viable build for you.
---
Open world is extremely easy. To the point where you can run something hard to play like a Zerk Weaver and play it completely suboptimal by using mostly Air and Fire skills + auto attack and still crush everything you encounter.
---
They've gone more in on the death branded stuff.
---
It sounds like it was mainly primordus and jormag who got the plant magic, but we put them back to sleep so they haven't had time to excerise that new power. I don't think we've seen much plant magic from kralky yet.
---
Better to assume incompetence than malice.
---
Also taimis chak organ filtering magic thing, where she realizes the chak filter out the bad magic while eating.
---
i doubt it
---
There aren't any.
---
We didn't get to see it, but braham claimed he had a group of norn going for jormag, but suddenly jormag fell disappeared.
---
As someone who has pugged 250+li I don’t agree that leaving is wrong as I believe that it is purely part and parcel of pugging raids and I have done all three of leaving groups because people weren’t good enough for me, left groups because of time constraints in real life and also been kicked from groups for not being ‘good enough’ by the commanders standards. In my opinion the  thing is if a raid group of any level can’t complete the raid encounter after 3 proper tries then it becomes at least worth checking other raid groups which are active at the time and so i leave. The thing is that i have done most encounters in high level 1000li+ groups 5 manning bosses regularly which means that I have no time for 100-250 li groups not being able to complete vale guardian when even at 150li I was able to 4 man MO and Cairn.  
---
*shrugs in scourge*
---
it's not really phenomenon - it has two possible reasons.
---
1. you always overestimate skills of your friends over skills of random pugs (better noob on discord than pro on chat)
---
2. you always overestimate value of meta classes over people who tailored builds for themselves (SnowCrows said we need chrono, so I am not gonna kick this under-performing chrono and wait few hours for a new one)
---
the main tournaments in GW1 were indeed GvG and i think 1v1 as i remember making prediction brackets for the xunlai tournament house every tourney to get tournament currency for zaishen keys.
---
I like the idea of slippery slope, tho it can be incredible frustrating.
---
I'd love to see more changes like this that impacted more and were super visible. I'm not sure how to pull it off in a way that's less frustration tho
---
Over 9000.
---
If you're looking for player numbers similar to steam [stats](https://store.steampowered.com/stats/), [this](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/guild-wars-2-the-first-year/) news release was the only time anet has ever published player population numbers and it was after the first year of release, arguably at the height of the games popularity.  Daily peak player numbers are probably lower now, how much lower is anybody's guess.
---
I didn't even think it was gradual. it just spiked after one moment
---
new itmes?
---
Whoa, you're right - it's almost double the normal exchange rate. That and gw2spidy is down, so I'm not sure how quickly it changed.
---
Somebody bought gems. Like, a lot of them.
---
Came here to post this. People will laugh if you do other game modes or high level group content with it, but it is seriously one of the most fun and effective ways to play solo or open world. 
---
Not that I've heard. Maybe some one datamined and didin't announce ? Still have to be a very large purchase to move it that much I think
---
it's foreshadowing for when they get killed off.
---
Yeah I was like "holy shit"
---
Even t3 heavy helmet has some issues. Some of the faces with longer snouts will clip through the front. It looks really bad.
---
[removed]
---
&gt; A lot of Somebodys 
---
Yea i literally looked at the gems to gold conversion for a sold 15 seconds. I was like wait...712gems for 250 gold? WUT?? Very weird. 
---
i assume he meant selling the Gift of Exploration. The answer is that the other person gives you all the mats and then a fee, then you craft the legendary and send it back to the other person. Of course this only works when the other person is someone who knows and trusts you.
---
There's still Pact Commander Outfit, probably comming today
---
Maybe if someone buys like 15k of real US money in gems... Crazy though.
---
Still, it just let me turn 1600 gems into 520 gold, pretty nice. 
---
One way might be by applying bonuses and drawbacks together. So for example weapon skills cast and recharge slower, but utility skills cast and recharge substantially faster. That way people are forced to focus on other builds and change up how they play, but they get to use their elite skills more frequently.
---
doubt that highly, unless it was a shit ton 
---
I was actually thinking about a new programme, because yes as you noticed this unwanted info pops up. But it was on trial, so wanted to check this out. Now I'm going to check OBS, lets see if it will work for me. Thanks!
---
Agree, Outflanked hits like a tank on trash mobs.. Doesn't add anything to fractals imo, just more chaos..
---
Slippery slope is kitten kitten kitten and makes no sence in highlevel content where positioning is key on many fights. It doesn't make fractals 'harder' but just more annoying and that is what you want from a game right?! Getting frustrated by things you can't control..
---
Don't agree on Social Awkwardness, It is funny for like 30seconds but then it just gets annoying and gives me motion sickness..
---
Shaking things up is a welcome change but some of these feel untested and 'bad' design.  
---
This is good for bitcoin.
---
Reaper's hood and Arah light shoulders. 
---
The same goes for weapons. The size changes when you unhook them.
---
Sorry but kicking out incompetent players has nothing to do with "overestimating the skills of your friends" or "overestimating the value of meta classes". It has to do with people lying about their experience to get into groups which they aren't qualified for.
---
If you join an experienced run on deimos or sloth or god knows what, most people expect you /not/ to fuck up the basics repeatedly. 
---
So when you see that one person wander around with their poison not really knowing where to go, and due to their indecision drop it straight in the middle of the group (and thus the room) then I expect people to /ff before they're even told to. 
---
Now lets assume we've got some patient pugs over here. Maybe the guy just didn't see, right? Frankly you should already ask them if they know what to do with poison. Often enough you'll be told "yes" or get no reply at all. Your group goes again. But if he does it once or twice more and it becomes painfully obvious the player doesn't know the boss at all, I assure you if the lead doesn't either manage the group well or kick them some players will leave. And as soon as one or two players leave, if the pleb stays half the group will follow more often than not. Frankly I can't blame them either. 
---
Same for deimos blacks, and plenty of other things. If you LFG for deimos on boss or high li requirements, someone joins and repeatedly begs for range strat, then walks into blacks once or twice... Yeah I suggest you kick before you lose your entire group. Because no, I do not want to LFG for a new HK. 
---
I'm not overestimating the rest of my group. I recognise that in pugs without voice, dealing with poison or black and recovering from it repeatedly is less likely than finding a pug who isn't trying to leech bosses they've never seen before. 
---
There is a huge difference between someone makes a mistake, and someone clearly doesn't know how to handle mechanics / the boss / ... Mistakes happen. Consistently making the same mistake ... well rip. 
---
Except there may be an issue with a player or two that can be corrected in a minute or two. And I'm talking about some really bad mechanics and wipes for catastrophic. If the boss was nearly dead within a reasonable amount of time but something caused a wipe and you'd leave my group under those circumstances I'd block you. I hope you realize that its a pretty dick move to leave like that under the circumstances I described. 
---
The stupidest things I've seen in pugs is people leaving mid-fight during a kill, and I do mean a kill. I'm sure we've all seen people drop mid fight only for the group to finish it with only 9 people. 
---
The other day I was doing Samarog and dumb ass thief got himself bitched slapped into some spikes and ended up dropping the group. 
---
Thanks, very appreciated
---
I know you already read a lot but those 2 guides are very nice for gearing characters (for PvE mostly) if you haven't already found them.
---
They are somewhat similar since the one form the wiki inspired the one from metabattle.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:How_to_Gear_a_Character
---
The good thing is that there is more than 1 way to get gear so you can pick the ones that are closer to what you already do.
---
By the way for efficient crafitng level up (if you want to go that way) I would recommend taking alook at [Gw2Craft](http://gw2crafts.net/).
---
Devona's Rest does as well!
---
Really wish they would adjust the drop rate of these things...they're \~3000g just to add similar functionality (hide/show) to that of helms and shoulders. It's not like people don't do them either, why are they on the same level drop rate as infusions?
---
And here I am, waiting for it to go to 120 so I can buy some gems so I can purchase two chapters of the living world 3.
---
I sense Simba vibes.
---
Bring back superspeed. That nerf was completely unnecessary for PvE.
---
don't forget gloves, gloves are always too big. Basically everything that is not racial armor is too big on (male) Sylvari.
---
Hello: i noticed you said no serpentine jewels after you’ve looted all three chests. Not sure if you’re aware, but as a PSA to anyone else who does t know, there are two hidden chests per plate chamber. There is only one hidden chest in the treasure room, though. You’ll know when you’ve collected/discovered all hidden chests in a given plate chamber when your Light buff no longer shows direction, rather, spreads out away from you in an even manner (kind of like a drop of water hitting a puddle). Hope it helps o/

ArenaNet just hired their new head of economy and this is their first act
---
MAN. I've been waiting since the end of summer for the exchange rate to drop down to a comfortable level (for me, it's &gt;110). I now have nearly 1k gold 'cause I've been waiting so long (I usually exchange at around 200/300 gold), and I don't play THAT much. 243??? Sweet, spreadable Jesus on a bagel...
---
All xp you get from your lvl 80 character on your account goes towards your masteries. If you are under lvl 80 you wont gain mastery xp but leveling xp but all lvl 80 add to the account pot of your masteries.
---
please stay like this for one more day!
---
A bunch of my guild mates all traded for gems like 2 or 3 hours ago to change servers officially together. I doubt it was us but funny how close it was to us moving.
---
is there a certain range? 100k? mil? 
---
Thanks! I decided to go for it yesterday. Already had 3 items found and found the fourth one. It's gonna take some time but I WILL get it! x3
---
Isn't it like mushrooms wear the invisible shoes? XD
---
Snowblind today was tiny bit frustrating on the last boss 'cause people kept pushing others into the AoE rings. But overall, the effect was minimal. 
---
&gt;then they'd end up with 16-17k dps in this way, which is not viable at all and they'd actually start hitting enrage timers if all played as such.
---
Do you actually raid? Because it sounds like you don't. 
---
There are these things called 'mechanics'. They interfere with your maximum possible DPS. Unless you are a boss with very little mechanics like MO, you will *not* hit the benchmarks. **Static golems are not raid bosses and benchmarks only show what a class is capable of. They are not to be used as gospel for the DPS a class can do on every encounter.** Example: You *will not* hit 30K DPS on Dhuum, ever. The maximum you will probably hit is 16-17k.
---
There is not a single boss where you would hit enrage timers with that DPS. 
---
&gt;you always overestimate value of meta classes over people who tailored builds for themselves (SnowCrows said we need chrono, so I am not gonna kick this under-performing chrono and wait few hours for a new one)
---
Indeed. Yes chrono is storng, but you don't need two to get a kill. Joined a training that desperatly searched for a chrono yesterday. It turned out that we only had one chrono to tackle gorseval in the end with mostly new players with highly suboptimal damage. A Renegade was asked to share alacrity in his subgroup as much as possible, while I tried to space out timewarps to somehow get a decent quickness uptime on everyone.
---
Due to low damage (most had like 10-12k) we had to do one updraft, but in the end of that try the kill was achieved. It still seems like a miracle, but it shows just how unimportant the second chrono is in reality. Its convenient, but nowhere needed. Especially not if your group is half decent.
---
It's a mismatch of expectations. Those super high LI groups indicate exactly that : they want to go for more "advanced" strategies rather than pug kills. And here you are wondering why they aren't using the easy pug strats as if you couldn't have seen it coming. 
---
I agree super high li during the middle of the week is often abit wonky. And some super high li groups are just people looking to get carried. But high li on monday morning / monday evening is often static groups which need a few pugs. Also keep in mind that these statics, in order to pull off these "SC" levels of play, also need practise. I know its crazy but i'd bet even SC wipes when practising new speedrun strats.
---
It's not crazy that more experienced players would rather wipe a few times practising what they consider a "better" strategy than default to pug strats for the kill. I'll give a simple example, i'm certain plenty of raiders would rather alt F4 than do deimos range strat. 
---
And if you actually learn to do most bosses with "low heal" suddenly people learn to stack up, not eat 13213132 free damage, not clown around all over the place, not repeatedly fail basic mechanics because they get healed through. They actually have to learn to avoid damage and position correctly rather than shifting the blame. You'd be suprised what a little extra pressure can do to smoothen up the runs in the long term. 
---
That 30 minutes of wiping and trying to actively improve rather than defaulting to minimum effort maximum reward is exactly why those statics end up reliably one shotting almost all the bosses in the game. And in my experience if it's really not working out and holding them up too long they'll swap and get it over with. At least i can be confident i'll get my kill. But not before actually trying, which isn't a bad attitude at all. 
---
If i join dhuum pugs i can't be confident i'll get a kill anytime soon. Yet if i join monday clears with a static i can be confident we'll clear W1-W5 in \~3 hours. Because they'd rather "waste" 20 minutes practising how to handle a boss properly than spend 2 extra minutes every single attempt to roleplay as a pug clownfiesta.
---
Tl dr : Some people want the kill, some people want to learn to play better. Many of these high li groups know they can get the kills. They'd also like to improve their gameplay / teamplay / strategies along the way. 
---
"why do I repeat the same day, why am I still here", somehow it made me feel bad for all npcs xD

I'm gonna hazard a guess and say Iron Beast GS.

Someone probably buying the entire gemstore as a meme. 
---
&gt; A bunch of my guild mates all traded for gems like 2 or 3 hours ago to change servers officially together 
---
This is a lie. Reddit has repeatedly told me WvWers don't bring income to the game. Only PvE players spend gems. 
---
Big brain move. Not sure if there is a daily cap on buying gems with gold. 
---
To be honest, my guild group often does gorseval without even bothering with meta. We just bring a bunch of people in minimum exotics and build that is not "whatever goes" but actually specialized in anything. We never did gorseval without doing all updrafts, but then again we rarely failed gorseval too... 
---
they could make the season 1 remake 1 player versions of the old instances and keep group content to fractals and the likes 
---
I'd guess half a million
---
 **hello to a complete noob** 
---
Running Banners on war was never a good excuse tbh. It's not rare in pugs that I do dps similar or higher to the actual dps players as warrior, even with banners. I see so many that just do about half of what they should do. It's not THAT hard to play warrior.
---
Total:  3441 matches /2060 wins 
---
Ranked: 1195 matches /625 wins
---
Nothing accurate. Zones are populated but with megaserver that is meaningless.
---
Im not in game atm but like 18k matches and about 12k wins 
---
&gt; don’t require kp either, experienced raider joins expecting good pugs, 
---
To be honest, I have no idea why anyone would expect good pugs in no requirement runs. You almost always have some experienced players, but you'll also almost always have training level players. They should know better. 
---
I did some ruff maths.
---
If the person had 200k in liquid gold, bought gems for 200k at a price of 130g/400gems then he got arlund 640k gems.
---
The exchange rate switched to 250g/688 gems according to a screenshot posted in this thread. Basically, the guy ended up with 223k~ gold or 200k + loads of extra gems.
---
 Thanks!

Personally I don't play Sylvari but still it pains me how they story are skittered here and there always missing some info, same with nightmare court. Rata Novus was so disappointing, whole asura city found, I understand the choice that the other asuras no longer live there but couldn't they live tons of easter eggs or portals, holograms, sth like interacting to get more lore or even to unlock some deeper hidden labs, or some mysterious revelations in those labs, idk just whole rata novus idea seemed abandoned at the same time it was created which is such a shame. 
---
It speaks "volumes" of quality!!!
---
anything Canach says
---
Maybe it's teapot changing his mystic coin stacks for keys ready for Luna new year lol 
---
Since everyone has been waiting for the legendary Greatsword since HoT launched, and since it's the only 2nd gen slot left to be filled.
---
It would be the biggest troll action Anet ever pulled.
---
It would be funny, it would probably also result in Anet's studio burning down to the ground.
---
Even with new items I've never seen it straight up DOUBLE on price. It's gone from 125g to something like 150g at max depending on item (140 for "just" outfits). Everytime I've seen new items it's been that rate.
---
when you want to use a fun p/p build use this one
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv5kfSkPlfA
---
its the build in the second half of the video.
---
If it’s gradual it’ll work for and against you. No loss in average speed over distance. Maybe even a slight increase if your selective with you’re route.
---
Birds -  need a better visual tell. Like an icon on top of the head. With all the visual noise on some encounters it become really hard to manage sometimes, just because you cant see what is going on.
---
Slippery Slope - affects 1 player at the time like flux bomb. You can add that the affected player leaves a trail of iced floor for a time when he was affected...
---
I like it as it is. If you dismount a second too early you can keep running forward without interruption. If you dismount perfectly you can stop and stand right next to a gathering node or an NPC.
---
Just got my plate... after killing 23 gravelings...
---
After which time my Light of Deldrimor buff had expired - I had been in that room for 25 minutes.
---
Please fix this ANet, I've never been so furious in GW2 to see a new player come in and snag the plate away first try without even hitting the graveling... and here I am on my 20th+ attempt.
---
&gt;.&lt;
---
Easiest things to try are [deleting GW2's cache](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/5bncp5/psa_dont_forget_to_clear_your_cache/) and running the -repair [Command Line Argument](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments) and see if those fix it.
---
Plot twist: They drop these 3 new legendaries, and announce new elite specs that use them, then they're not underwater legendaries.
---
Its not a hard instability sure, but an annoying one just like old SA was. To me it makes fractals unfun to play thats why i skip it after experiencing it once even tho i had no problem dealing with it.
---
Let's see how they can powercreep Eternity.
---
good point, i'm on board now ･ิ ͜ʖ･ิ
---
&gt; Yes, Mirage remains silly on Dhuum.
---
This is really wrong.
---
The mirage build that functioned well on Dhuum was Chaos. Chaos relied on boons to give Mirage the extra condi duration it needed. Since Chronos have been nerfed, Chaos Mirage is no longer anywhere near 'silly'. Chaos is **dead** and straight up worse everywhere now than Illusions. But Dhuum has very low attacks per second, so Illusions, which is focused more on confusion, performs badly too. 
---
The thing about velocity in gems is that movements has to be replicated to clients. So every change in speed has to be replicated so that every player is in sync and sees the same result.   
---
For gradually increasing velocity you have different options to replicate by using a timer (ie. 5 seconds until max speeds and every second tick it increase the value of velocity.)
---
Option 1: replicate every tick of the timer. -&gt; very very bad implementation.
---
Option 2: replicate the start of the timer function with the parameters and every client goes through it themself. -&gt; better
---
Even though option 2 sounds good it is still a massive hit because you need to replicate timer resets, starts and timer start ats (for those little water puddles that make you go fast/slow/fast.)  
---
I think this change isn't really needed and I believe they think twice before going through with stuff that further increases amount of replication.  
---
Anyway, I dunno how they exactly handle this stuff, but I can think of this being more resource intensive than just replicating two values (fast/slow) and every resource saver is golden for an MMO I believe.  
---
Why don’t you use the level 80 character you boosted last time to play the first instance of POF    to get the first mounts then continue levelling your new character 
---
It's back to normal again.
---
These are the 3 different meta
---
Oh man, i woul swear i hit the middle :( the length of fish jump is random right ? :D
---
You better buy them even with 130/400, it is worth it, and that added 10-20g is nothing. You can expect it to be at a bit lower amounts in between releases, but otherwise....**it won't drop**.
---
The main reason is that Anet learned to work with it. They actually release new stuff every 2-3 weeks, so there is literally zero time in between updates to let it drop. It is not just major LS updates, but also all the festivals, in between it is races, novelties, runes, all those updates...they deliver all the times and thus people keep playing, and gems are in continual demand. This is waaaay different than one year ago, when there was not much to do in between LS updates.
---
I don't actually know, but I'd just assumed the jumps were the same length. It's basically just the angle that's important in my experience. 
---
I would take it over Druid staff sound in a heart beat ^^
---
I can see that leading to more reactive play, which is good.
---
I for one dont care if he wants to be abrasive. I can be very abrupt and a rough with people myself, but its all within context. If youre coming into my squad acting like a dickhead it is a problem and Ill be rough. But if youre somebody who is genuinely lost and looking for help, Ill pour my heart into you and make sure youre set up before I leave you alone.
---
But when somebody like this is being an asshole and treating others like crap, especially those who are lost and looking for help. Thats not something any decent person can let slide by their moral position so easily.
---
Talk to your closest friend in DnT and just ask them how his attitude and behaviour is affecting the performance of the guild. Show me the content coming from DnT and tell me how a person's attitude and treatment of others doesnt have any bearing on the quality of content a person produces.
---
Yes, I was considering buying it for 130\~ But now I guess I have to wait a little more.
---
I guess I’ll consider myself lucky that I haven’t heard that yet
---
Well, yes, I dont believe we need elite spec in a LW episode, and I dont believe that would be a good idea, and yes at that point it would be hard to balance if they come so close to eachother. 
---
I am just saying, with expac, elite spec are good. For LW episodes, they can do other neat stuff that fit more and makes more sense. 
---
To be honest, if you could get a drop of another player items in PvP or WvW if you kill them (even with small chance) we would hunt players with nice skins without a question.
---
I think it’s just a lot of exchange happening , it should goes back to normal ^^
---
We will give that a try .  
---
Thanks :)
---
I think it was intentional so that it differentiates Norns from humans.
---
Sylvari also have weirdly big boots and shoulders but on a more slender frame.
---
If you play many alts of each race, it’s actually quite fun because the same armour skins may work better for a Norn than a human and it adds some variety in which skins you use for each alt of the same weight class but of different race.
---
maybe one day we can get a fotm of that would love to see jormag stupid head if we never going fight him now ever.
---
inb4 next patch boons and conditions merged into single type called "things", to prevent positive or negative association with the terms.
---
Things grant stuff to you. It is okay. You can have or not have Things. All play styles are unique and special. etc etc.
---
Every time I see such a white and icy look on an elementalist I just wish that frost-themed skills would be given as an alternative to healing from water elementalist, instead of being given to necro.
---
What the are you on about. The person you replied to stated this : 
---
&gt; Another phenomenon is when a commander is not capable of kicking a person who is harming the run until the whole group disbands. 
---
You replied literally this : 
---
&gt; it's not really phenomenon - it has two possible reasons. : overestimate meta specs and overestimate your guildies
---
I can assure you people joining bosses and lying about their experience happens quite regularly. I have no idea why you assume every run has a guild with people on voice behind it. There is this thing called "PUG GROUPS" which most of the thread is about. I have NO IDEA what it has to do with "meta" builds. By all means do explain. 
---
Would I prefer teaching players on voice rather than random pugs? 100% definitely. But that isn't relevant at all to the phenomenon they describe. Would I do this in a random full pug group at higher li? Doubtful.
---
Pug runs at higher li are regularly expected to go smooth, definitely for the easier wings. They don't have /anyone/ on voice. They don't have any intention of "training" people either. So if someone holds up the raid by genuinely being at entry level rather than experience then they're in the wrong group. You'll have a mismatch of expectations. If the commander doesn't adress this appropriately, then it's not weird to see the group disband. 
---
This is what someone was talking about; and you said it isn't a thing. I tried to explain to you some situations where it /is/ a thing. 
---
&gt; When I was writing about under-performers I was mostly meaning people with lower DPS. Because it's often those way too focused on perfect rotation with top DPS, that are fucking up mechanics. But you would think twice before kicking out your top DPS, right? 
---
I literally didn't say a word about DPS. You think being top dps will magically shield you when you wipe everyone by dropping awful poisons or walking into black repeatedly? You think people that don't know how poisons work somehow manage to consistently be top DPS? Both are pretty unlikely. 
---
So really... I have no idea what you're talking about. Somehow I'm evil, sit AFK in aerodome for hours waiting on groups to disband while being elitist. But I wouldn't kick anyone who's meta and top dps. Must be the case because if you follow the meta you're a blind sheep I bet. No idea where I said any of this... but hey all elitists are doing braindead dps and ignore all mechanics and surroundings right?! 
---
I just read you stated in another comment you don't ever kill gorseval without doing updrafts. Let's just agree that our raiding experience is entirely different.
---
Tbh for about week the game been full of people almost 24/7 all maps. People doing SW, Istan, Kourna, the dailies. Even WvW is busy ^^
---
PvP take time to queu longer than usual in the morning “EU” and it’s understandable since it’s off season.
---
It has a very Healthy population ^^
---
Yea, no way to do it now. I would wait at least a day until it gets corrected, or if devs will do something about it (even rollbacks possible) but then it is pointless to wait months.
---
As I said it,s a rough estimate. And yeah I took into account that the gems-gold conversion rate is pretty much giving a big advantage to the house. A screenshot showed that it came down to 688 gems/250 gold so I took that as a rough estimate.
---
But apparently you can only transfer 10k gems at once so the numbers would be heavily skewed and my maths is wrong.
---
Why would I mind if you don’t tag our common guild ? I mean, there aren’t any mandatory representation or something close to this ^^ 
---
(I’ll be happy to tag ZORG if you don’t mind 😇)
---
I didn't know that, which makes my estimate/rough maths guesstimate wrong. Thanks for clearing it up for me.
---
Never was a fan of instabilities but apparently after reaching fractal god and three stacks of unstable cosmic essences I have to "git gud".
---
/shrug
---
Bottom line is that I do not enjoy fractals post patch anymore and dropped them entirely.
---
Another lie. Everyone knows WvW doesn't actually give gold, so real WvWers don't have gold to convert to gems.

&gt; Like if I get an ascended ring from Living Season 3 (edited), I get to put harrier (or whatever) on it?
---
On LS3 Trinkets you will normally only be able to get HoT stats (and Diviner too apparently). You can check out the list of [Attribute Combination](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Attribute_combinations) and filter by HoT/PoF stats or look at the [Ascended Trinket](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_trinket) page to see which trinket can give you what.
---
Some are grinding for the Exquisite Serpentine Jewels used to craft Exotic Inscription/Insignia because they want to swap stat of some gear in the forge. It's also possible they farm this for the Dragonsblood weapon collections that need Diviner Inscriptions too. You can also buy Diviner trinkets for Laurals + ecot directly from the volatile magic vendor in the new map but considering the cost I would not recommend it as taking a Difluorite trinket or LS3 trinket (since they have them apparently)  is better.
---
Well, as of the 1.8.2 update, I can't get GW2LB to launch at all. I get as far as the Crash log error notification, then nothing. Deleting the crash log did not help.
---
I'm sure this can be done somehow. We have roller beetles already and they work fine - their velocity is always changing as they roll, bounce and fly across varied terrain.
---
Idk sometimes combos are weird for example social awkwardness + stick together. 
---
So since 1.8.2 came out, I didn't see this.  Is it an option, or something else?
---
I gotcha! Thanks for all the info. And yeah, reading those wiki pages of those LS3 items I was surprised that they could be diviner. Kinda made me think they might not be accurate.
---
Harrier and diviner are probably the stats I'm most interested in (trying to get boon duration for renegade, viper for open world stuff), I guess I'll see how it goes.
---
Thanks again for all the help :)
---
they bought for 32.96 and sold for 38.31
---
9999 gems makes 3295.67 gold in expense and that gives 3830.62 in return, with profit of 534 gold
---
9999 does not seem enough to move amount to shift the price tho, it would take a significant bunch of account to pup that high.
---
&gt;that doesn't distract from the fact it looks like WoW
---
Looks like? But have you played GW1 or are you just judging by the looks?
---
&gt;People who liked gw1 combat but hates gw2 if they can't cope with the newer fast pace combat system.
---
No, people that don't like gw2 combat as much is because it lacks the tactical element gw1 combat had.
---
Which gamemode?
---
Spectral Walk is a core necro skill but a very srong one.
---
Ele with 30% less hp with those instabillity is not really fun. Ele need a hp buff and i do not get why this have not happened since elite specs came out. Not a high hp buff but i mean 8 k hp and then the damage increase from mobs like really? Did they even try this first?
---
I actually have a completely different water theme for when I'm playing healer ele. This is my zerker gear. I also have a seperate theme for when playing condi weaver.
---
Those are probably the new faces added after launch? Unsure works perfectly with the face i use.
---
Eh, they really weren't that fun to begin with. But then again, pre-rework AC and CoF1 were pretty much the only group content I really enjoyed in GW2, so ...
---
they bought for 32.96 and sold for 38.31 (per 100 gems)
---
* 9999 does not seem enough to shift the price tho, it would take a significant bunch of account to pump that high.
---
* also it seems not everyone was fast enough to sell at high price 
---
Yep
---
If anyone of you you wanna tell me the current situation of Slippery Slope doesnt suck: Go on a Warrior (including Axe/Axe set) and have fun with the F1 while Slippery Slope is active in CMs (specially 100 sucks here)... There is nothing better than e.g. dying instantly at 100CM 1. Boss last phase because of that.
---
I'll play devil's advocate and say that Thunderhead Peaks its because is not in the Crystal Desert. The lore explanation for bounties is that certain monsters have been corrupted by "ley energy" and it might not have affected Thunderhead Peaks in the same way.
---
Cute. This style is different from the commissions i’ve seen so far and it’s refreshing! I like that pokerface. 
---
Good job!
---
You can "sell" a gift of mastery by crafting a legendary weapon and exchange it to an other player for the mats and some gold. 
---
You can look up r/GW2Exchange if you want some examples. They usually sell around 500-600g.
---
I think unfortunately you are going to have to buy HoT standalone. When going through the GW2 website and getting a bundle it gives you one code for both expansions. 
---
I’d recommend looking at the official retailer list. I know amazon had it on sale for a bit. 
---
Made a guild to establish a brand name in the WvWvW, ended up being a tight knit family and a brandname. Although the original roster is long gone, the concept still applies to the new members. Honestly we're one of the oldest guilds in EU WvW I think. Hiatus'es not included.
---
OP it's all up to you and what you want to do, that's the glory of GW2, you can just honestly pick what you want be and associate yourself with it. Eventually it becomes your identity ingame. 
---
Just you do you bae
---
Regarding Outflanked:
---
&gt; Either a much lower damage modifier- maybe down to 75% or 100% instead of 300%, a smaller flanking angle (think, back only), or just a better indication of when you're being flanked would make this significantly more fair to play against.
---
Just a small thing for clarification: They do 300% dmg, not 300% additional damage - meaning that you prob should write 175% or 200% as input... while I would personally still disagree and would say 150% are highest they should go with...
---
'Commander, over here!'
---
Add: Been tag once, and everyone was nice, but that one guy was trash and blamed the tag.
---
If I were to play the Devil's advocate I would say that instabilities are meant for you to play around. If you think ele has too few HPs with the instab then go around this limitation and use another class when this instab is up. It's probably annoying I won't deny that but it forces you to change how you approach a specific fractal instead of mostly doing like usual. At least that's how I understand instab (independently of how I agree or not with how some of them feel currently).
---
that sounds kinda convoluted and a good way to get scammed
---
Wrong direction: Converting gems to gold would have reduced the ratio so https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ag6fn3/gold_to_gems_just_went_from_130_to_243_in_like_an/ee3znd9/ would be more likely (still wouldn't believe that, so wtf?). The price correction afterwards should be people profiting from the spike converting, I'd expect mostly saved ones, gems to gold.
---
Well obviously it is like that. But that does not change the fact that all players in the entire game including the most self proclaimed hardcore of all harcore, get caught up at some point because of misstakes, lag or what ever sudden reason that can happen and will.
---
&gt; I couldn't solo content with a massive struggle (no henchies)
---
I kinda experience this in reverse. In GW2 I always struggled with surviving with an elementalist, and so didn't enjoy the class too much. I started GW1 recently, and rolled an elementalist, and I'm having a blast with it due to the heroes. No need to solo survive anything. I love having assists in GW2 too (necro minions, ranger pets), and it's amazing that in GW1 that experience is not bound to class.
---
Thanks!
---
This should be the top comment.
---
Or maybe don't wear cannon glass ele.
---
Fixed a bug that made fractals too lucrative for the time spent.
---
Sirens reef on T4 with no pain no gain...Now that was a chore to get through
---
Just like you, this game didn't suit me at first. I mean, I pre-ordered it in (apparently) 2012. Played it for a couple of weeks, got some chars to lvl 40-something, but the mechanics didn't really suit me. Coming from oldschool Korean MMORPG's with holy Trinity classes and much slower gamepace.   
---
GW2 seems to be different on many levels.   
---
Gameplay and combat is much faster, and to this day I'm still not entirly sure if I like that aspect of it.   
---
PvE is extremely easy (as in open world), perhaps too easy. Doing bosses doesn't really entail much more than continuously hitting nr.1 button and hitting it with the odd dodge inbetween.   
---
Then you come to PvP and everything seems to be fastforwarded times x10, boons, conditions and blocks lasting but a couple seconds. Tons of HP going down in miliseconds before you have time to realize, let alone, analyze what happened.   
---
That aside, I started GW2 again just recently with a different mindset and I've been able to get into it more slowly than I did before.   
---
Up till now I seem to enjoy it more than I used to.   
---
I'd recommend finding a newbie friendly guild that is willing to tag you along in jumping puzzles/fractals/pvp and such without too much expectations. It goes a long way with experiencing these things from being "impossible" to "they're actually fun".   
---
Also playing the right class does wonders. Classes you thought you would like turn out to be much different than you'd expect by reading up on them. So, sometimes it works by going out of your comfort zone and taking that one class you would think isn't for you but.. well, who knows, it may just be a match. 
---
I would like it if our characters returned to their initial mentors. Completely broken, sylvari return to the pale tree, humans to their adoptive parents, charr to their warband, etc. 
---
Instabilities rework aside, if you're not having fun with very repetitive PvE content (GW2 in a nutshell) to the point where it feels like a chore, I'd say you should just drop it mate. There is no point spending time doing something that doesn't bring you joy and, just like voting with your wallet, the less people play fractals the sooner Anet will realize something is not right.
---
that sounds a bit unreasonable to expect from anet.
---
Change up your group tactics/composition or move away from the meta and adapt. They're all new mechanics. Adapt. Overcome.
---
You know how Thief works right?
---
Have you thought about changing the character, or the build? Why would you want to stick with same build if it does not work for that situation?
---
You get it in open world too. Just a piece of advice: the monster always drops the next plate but always for a different player. I dont know how the player is chosen that gets the drop but apparently, the plate will drop for that very person everytime until they leave the room. At least thats what happened to me when i did the catacombs with a couple friends. Nobody except for me was able to get the next plate until i left the room...
---
Later, cub.
---
 Why? It would fit quite well, Some self reflection about the damage the Commander has caused to the World. 
---
If I had an hour to spare to do something in GW2, I would go raid, if I had 30 minutes-ish I used to go play fractals, now I just play Dota. Why? Cause fractals is just not that fun anymore. It used to be borderline fun doing cm and then clearing the T4, these days I just see it as more of a rng dice roll where I do the least cancer fractals and just leave for the day to play something else. I still try to do CMs tho unless the instabs are truly aids. 
---
Outflanked is insane, but i like it. Maybe tune it down to 200%. 
---
Slippery slope is hell. it should be fun, but its poorly implemented. Stability should counter it though, soyou could at least adapt to it.
---
We bleed fire is very fun IMO, but you should be able to reflect it back at enemies.
---
As I said they can't be *real* WvWers because those wouldn't be changing servers in the first place. 
---
Necro female was Thriller. Male was headbanging. Loved it.
---
you know, correct play is standing at 1,2k range spamming longbow autoattacks without boons for some people.
---
Ice-skating on Artsariiv's platform with 8k hp was much "fun" as well.
---
And it's not that certain combinations are too hard. Nah, most of the instabs you learn to handle in a few tries. But the problem is, they're neither fun, nor a challenge. They are merely an annoyance.
---
I'm afraid it affects some of the newer (pre-HoT) faces, but is not limited to them. I'd have to check it though.
---
Because: 
---
1. You mostly want to have a Warrior for Banners, EA, lots of CC and partially boon remove while still being able to get good own DPS
---
2. Axe/Axe basically gives you the biggest damage advantage while still doing former mentioned, and still works with that instability... but it sucks to play for sure (while also for many other builds and spells using actual movement mechanics) 
---
3. People dont want to change their half build and rotation with huge sacrifices again for another shitty instability (Yo, NPNG!)
---
Male ritualist = napoleon dynamite. I wanted to learn the dance after i saw it rhe first time xD
---
Where can I find this graph?
---
I think that Slippery Slope does not work for people mainly because they are stuck in their mind with a single "meta" build and class. If they were more willing to change builds (for example to ranged, where your position does not matter that much), or even willing to change characters...it would be way easier to complete it.
---
But how hard is to accept that your meta build is not meta when certain instabilities are on? (I would say multiple of instabilities do in fact hit into this) How hard is to change your aproach based on this? 
---
Why not play the new class? The revenant may not be a strong range class but still really fun either way. Also Weaver (ele pof spec) is a lot of fun
---
Where's the head?
---
yeah no, that's not how these things work.
---
Snowball effect. 1 leaves, another decides it's not work waiting for a replacement. 2 more follow because the waiting time has just doubled, everybody else assumes it's over.
---
I am also puzzled since last week. First I found perfect that we had no end of story music to show it was not a victory. But then I wondered how it will be to wait for 3 months in this stage and how awkward it will be to discover the next step so late. 
---
At first I thought they would announce something very fast like no Ep6 but the release of Dragon Stand like map for Kralk and during the end cinematic Aurene would come back. This could make sense if we would go very soon there and had no time to mourn over her body. 
---
Aurene coming back with Joko's power (trending up theory) should happen quite fast so if we have to see it happen in 3 month it would break some immersion. 
---
Maybe (my personal fantasy) the Commander actually collapsed after saying "I don't know" and then next episode will start with our character waking up after some weeks. It would start with a dream at the end of which we see Aurene. We wake up and she is really here and then Taimi explains that we collapsed, she came back to life and is  guarding our body since then.
---
Same (except Fractal Prodigy). I used to love doing reset CMs &amp; T4 daily but I've just been diverted from fractals, and all I do now is log in for daily AP then log out.
---
The new instabs are just an artificial way to make fractals take longer and offer no new challenge. (Amusingly, the only instab that I really enjoy now is SA.)
---
try revenant. he has a strong ranged weapon (hammer) that you can use from the beginning.
---
Yes, Pact Bureau of Investigations? This comment right here.
---
Where you can see skritt in dredge armor? I am curious.
---
Well thanks, I tried to include everything relevant ^^
---
I think it's day 8 now? Still hoping for a reply every few hours 
---
Ooooh yes I'd love that! But we've grown so much since then that there's nothing they can tell us. It would be a great means of showing how far we've come.
---
'Well play a different class then' shouldn't be the way to play an instab...
---
500-600% should be the minimum MF% if you open blues or greens, otherwise its not worth the effort and MF buffs.
---
6 stacks of unids per hour is also very small batch size. Players who open unid gear in bulk for profit can manage between 40-80 stacks per hour because they can ID a full stack at a time (more than 300 bag slots) and can dumb hundreds of exotics into their bank to deal with later on, once the sample is done and buffs run out. 
---
Since you get a certain amount of profit per stack of unids, they obviously make much more g/h than you and I would suggest just selling them on the tp to save yourself the hassle and rather save up your mf buffs for times when you have more account storage and can handle bigger sample sizes per hour.
---
Anet focuses on mostly single player content through the living world story. Not as much as the MMO driven multiplayer experience. 
---
Also nice people doesn't mean they have unlimited time to spare, if it takes half an hour to complete the least cancer fractals, only the least cancer ones will be played. I used to clear everything in half an hour, and now I dont. 
---
If I wanted to clear everything and it must take an hour, I might as well go play something that feels more fun to me, like raiding. Helping NA pugs cheese raids on heal necro or chronotank is pretty fun afterall. 
---
And most importantly, is it really nice to be telling another player who like the game that you are glad they aren't enjoying it anymore? Sounds like a big case of "gtfo we don't want you here" to me. Not sure if that's what nice players in GW2 do. 
---
&gt; open at most 6 stacks of unids every hour 
---
What is your limiting factor here? If you use the very short boost the chests give you, maybe it would be good to consider to just dump that boost and identify a lot faster in return. You still get the other SW-related boosts.
---
I've been playing guild wars 2 for about a month. It is absolutely the best MMORPG I've ever played. This community is the best you will always find something to do. Besides the story you have world events, you can do pvp, WvW, and you don't have to wait till you hit max lvl.
---
The community it very welcoming. If you ever need help just type /m (map) and ask people will help you. I bought both expansions my 3rd day in the game not sure if they are still on sale on Amazon. I recommend getting them if you can afford them. It opens up other maps, you can get gliders (HoT), PoF you can get a mount. You also get a booster that can put you to level 80 instantly. 
---
Welcome and if you want to play together sometime add me in game. (Tas Journey) 
---
Have fun and enjoy the grind! 
---
I quit pvp with shitty pof powercreep meta
---
&gt;It would start with a dream at the end of which we see Aurene. We wake up and she is really here and then Taimi explains that we collapsed, she came back to life and is guarding our body since then.
---
is there an article floating around of a gas leak in anet's office or do you genuinely belief that's a good idea?
---
Hmmm I dunno, I want Aurene back, but I don't want it to happen straight away. Either it's a big ruse and she isn't dead, or if she comes back she's changed forever.
---
I suppose the three month gap is always going to be strange when you're up to date. This transition in particular will be interesting when playing it all through from start to finish.
---
Yeah.... they worked on both Faction and Nightfall before Prophecies were already released though. So it was waaaaay more than six months working time on them. 
---
yeah, good thing we got more then that in the last 11 months, secondly we don't know how difficult it is to make content for each game. (and from what i've seen gw2 is way harder to make content for then gw1)
---
hmm, but in what context? you run regular cm/t4 or just casually t1? cause in 100cm its awful.
---
I think it was a good idea. We just faced an Elder Dragon and lost we were wounded and our last hope was "killed". Having one of our allies asking what do we do now and us saying "I don't know" god that gave me chills we failed ohh lord we finally failed I'm so happy. The black screen shows that we failed and we haven't got a hope in hell lets rejoice our commander is infallible. 
---
That's how mafia work... oh wait.
---
It's more "play another class if YOU  don't think you can pull it off with this" because some people will definitively be able to pull it off but if you can't then change what you need to succeed. But then maybe overcapping slightly AR to be able to take the Sword trait and get extra vitality could also be enough.
---
1) that's just committing suicide and 2) that's more something braham would do rather then the commander.
---
i don't see it happening that next episode would play out like that
---
I never brought up LS2, what are you talking about?
---
Oh sweety no those traits are fucked up, and you want earth/geomancy runes on shortbow and doom/earth on mace axe.
---
For corruption u want 321. You're not getting resistance from any source anymore (its not worth applying your own since its such a massive energy sink) so gm 2 is useless and youre better off getting the burn from gm1.
---
In invocation you really don't need the fury sources. You're better off getting the damage bonus from adept 2 and the extra boons from master 1. Charged mists is infinitely better on the Condi build, especially with renegade since renegade gives you 33% crit chance (when endurance is full). Even then, while 100% crit helps rampent vex proc more torment, ultimately its not that big of a loss when u dodge. You gain far more dps from the extra 25 energy on legend swap.
---
I like that light of Deldrimor solution, it would allow you to help others as well, and not to worry about losing your buff time
---
Your point about the difficulty of adding content is a good one but Nightfall had way more content than the episodes we got in the last 11 months
---
I love Slippery Slope.. it is literally a game changer... something that I want. Sure it can be hell, but that's the point of it
---
Well, that's the thing some part of the players community yaps for past 6 years; according to them they should and it's unacceptable that game with such name doesn't have that gamemode
---
"CONTENT CHANGE! GRUG UNDERSTAND OLD CONTENT! GRUG NO UNDERSTAND NEW CONTENT YET! CONTENT BAD!"
---
And if you have to tank (knowing that weaver zerk have 1121 and FB 1250 th) ?
---
If you wanna get a bit more vitality on Ele go for overcapping AR and Sword trait. If you start getting too much vitality in (you can probably get some with Valky as long as you are still capped in crit chance) then you're probably better off getting on another class instead that can survive better while not losing DPS (like DH with retal trait + valky or Soulbeast or something else power).
---
Had the exact same problem, but it seems that the heroic focus skin isn't working at all right now, so the entire collection is bugged in many ways.
---
You can't replace Diviner by Commander only because BD is minor on Commander. I Think it's easier to replace zerk by knight because you have less thing to change
---
http://lmgtfy.com/?q=how+to+make+money+in+gw2

Reroll for swamp
---
Here's [my attempt at a Diviner Firebrand build so far](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQRAnd7ensADFChtCBGBDEEhF+BbPj+RPpYBg0TRw6BMu2TA-jxRBQBmRJ4T1PMxTCQWV/ZsK/Iy+DA4JAEAIB48YeMPmHw5Zemn5ZemHXn5Zemn5Zemn5ZemnMVKgIWGB-e), note that I've used Grieving gear to simulate Diviner's gear since the editor hasn't been updated yet; where you see condition damage, imagine it's concentration. The build should have 100% boon duration.
---
I've yet to actually gear and retrait my character in game, but in theory it keeps up 100% quickness, fury and 25 stacks of might to 5 allies, ~90% protection uptime (assuming alacrity) to 5 allies, self-retaliation for the Radiance buffs, self-vigor and on demand stability. None of these assume use of tomes. The utilities are flexible, only Mantra of Potency is core to the build. Mantra of Lore (condi removal), Wall of Reflection, "Hold The Line!" (full protection uptime) and Sword of Justice (more damage) are all good options depending on what you're facing.
---
What I found was, I could take Zeal in order to make the greatsword worthwhile or Honour in order to stack a bunch more might. I have my doubts as to whether the greatsword is worth using without Zealous Blade. I also considered Perfect Inscriptions, but found it hard to replace the missing critical chance increase from Righteous Instincts.
---
One day I raided and the commander was LN xdxdxdxdxdxdxd
---
Not funny...
---
I've cleared my email several times. I was able to find the email where they sent me a link to click to activate my account. 
---
Birds plus tempest DPS = to dodge or not to dodge, that is the question. 
---
In my experience most high level 100cm groups can handle the no healer comp aslong as the firebrand and renegade are big brain. The firebrand can also take honor for a minimal dps loss but some extra pasive healing.  If someone dies constantly with this comp I think they are exposed as eating to many mechanics. 
---
For lower level groups Imo this is a difficult question to answer because firebrand is both the better support and the better dps. Beyond that firebrand benefits much more from having more boon duration and the build/rotation flexibility to apply those boons, since it can apply a larger range of boons. 
---
Personally I would run the firebrand as a healer but it can go either way. 
---
well we can either copy paste the answers that have been listed a thousand times before, or you could just look them up yourself.
---
It is very much a part of the roller beetle, though, and the slippery slope effect. It's part of the game now and it would be nice to see it be used in more places. I do think it should stay out of movement impairing conditions, it would change combat too much (and probably be a massive headache to implement). But having more mount-related momentum would be great imo.
---
Cant wait what the new espec is gonna be like! Renegade was a blast
---
If you like the skin but don't like the particle effect, then that's a valid complaint because Anet will not create another skin like it without the effect.So if you like norn skins that have more realism and don't generate their own magical snow, then gg.
---
It's also hard when another instability forces dodge use too, like birds.
---
I was looking for what people who have played this game for longer than me do personally.  Many of the answers I've found might be too dated as they are from 2014 or so.
---
You dont run a druid since might is already covered, you take a SB for spirits if needed. powerbrand outdps’s condibrand in fractals with a good group due to burst. 
---
If we apply that to human terms it's like saying don't own your TV or computer. The mushroom didn't stand a chance.
---
Actually yes it is !
---
Worry not, when it rises too much, Anet generally forcibly bring it down to keep the gold conversion at an acceptable value...otherwise we would have to pay like 500 golds for 100 gems by now, lol.
---
No I wouldn't want to touch it with a 1 foot pole. I'd fall asleep pretty quickly from the lack luster slow combat. Larger build variety falls empty when there is no way to use them in fun engaging ways.
---
Lacking tactical element from gw1 combat would have been a part of the reason. But the overwhelmingly main reason is because they can't adapt to the new combat mechanics that gw2 offered, a combat system that is much more fast pace and required much better reactions from players than its predecessor. Because fast pace smooth combat is cornerstone of GW2's long term replay ability. People just say its simply because gw2 don't play the same as gw1 because they don't want to look bad.
---
As I stated, I'm looking for current answers.  Much of what I found is dated from around 2014-2016
---
With renegade and heal whatever, in a perfect world. That way boons will be covered completely, and party would still have 4 dps.
---
Hi, I tried to see my sales history but there is no button to choose between buy or sell (but i can see them on your screenshot).
---
There just «no buy history». On gw2efficiency i can see my history. What can i do ?
---
Oh, we gonna fight him, just not that soon. 
---
The main problem of what caused these loose ends: Voice actors. That's why she's probably still in PTSD state to deal with the whole Kralk stuff.
---
To be fair, that is in the mind of a lot of players too.
---
and many of the answers you will find are from 2018...
---
whatever, sorry i even bothered to show you how to use google. i'm sure there will be someone willing to copy paste the answers for you.
---
Probably people preparing for the inevitable Caithe's Crystal Bloom Sword coming to gemstore from that\_shaman's dat diving post last week. It's bound to show up today.
---
I agree, it would be a fantastic addition to the mounts, though I imagine it would not be easy to implement without causing some severe movement hiccups due to momentum and movement verification with the server getting WAY more load intensive. Lag would go through the roof if suddenly everyone on a mount had momentum that had to be verified with the server. And yes, the verification would be required otherwise movement hacks would be stupid easy. 
---
I'm.just going to delete this whole post.  I'm wasting my time and yours.  
---
I certainly would like to see some ex-Mordrem Guard making a grand redemption stand to fight off an Elder Dragon, even if the individual sylvari aren't really fighters. Though I don't think Malyck would be included in such a group as an actual ex-Mordrem Guard due to lore (Mordremoth converted sylvari to the Mordrem Guard via the Dream, Malyck has no connection to the Dream).
---
ESO, Runescape,  and BDO probably have more players, followed by GW2.
---
My french suck , but it wasnt jokeu coz this person wasnt on my block list :o.
---
The only way to make a Necromancer Charr look good is using the outfit "Exemplar Attire" fully dyed black.
---
Us light armored charrs have no fashion options :(
---
And he raided with you and you're nobody xdxdxdxdxd
---
"Death... Good!"
---
"Everyone, come!"
---
"So... Tired."
---
I relate to the risen, apparently.
---
I have 6600k and no problems at all with number 1 and 2. Might be your settings or could be something wrong with PC? (Maybe other programs going on in background?) I'd open up task manager and check if there is anything spiking CPU usage. 
---
Which 4 dps? Do you count FB / ren as DPS or support here? 
---
Because I think your build barely competes with "boon chrono" diviner / zerk mixes in terms of DPS. 
---
I have also stopped doing Fractals. I still sometimes join guildmates, but they are a lot more of a chore now, which is sad. A lot of them are really long to do now (they were supposed to be challenging and quick), instabilities are sometimes ridiculous and I just do not like it much anymore. I'd rather do AB meta for fun.
---
I have more fun running old dungeons or doing HoT metas than doing open-world PoF or fractals.
---
I think I'm burned out from the game again and sometimes will only log in to get the dailies and gathering done on my alts. Sometimes I just do not even bother to log in.
---
r/gatekeeping leaking again I see
---
Agreed ;)
---
for what game mode?
---
I always forget that Warriors can use the bow - I only use Rifle because I got an Exotic one as a lucky drop, and because lots of Metabuilds specs say ‘use it if you need to range’. 
---
QUESTION: would this setup work with Mace/Shield instead of Sword? I hate to admit it, but I don’t like sword particularly - it feels lackluster (in my totally ignorant, clueless experience, of course). 🤔😁
---
In pug environment even that is worth of dps spot, so yes - 4 dps, 2 of which send boons, and one healer.
---
So many awesome options - thanks for this!! 
---
Check on metabattle and snowcrows for more info. Most of professions have a meta build , either in support or dps. Even thief is considered meta dps in raids now. But mesmer/druid/banner warrior still hold top of meta i think
---
get good
---
Hello noob. Now git gud! 😋
---
I usually group up with a buddy who mains ranger / druid... Even offscreen it's unbearable :(
---
Clickbaits and karma milking never die
---
yes actually it is
---
As has already been mentioned, Necros are my favorite open world class. Either power minion reaper with GS or even a condi scourge. They don't put out the most dps but they do well and have some of the best survivability aspects in the game. 
---
Nice as always guys...ty for answers
---
Well I run the game in borderless window @  2560x1440 and most settings high with Low Model Limit and Reflections/Shadows off. It's definitely GW2 per the task manager. I might need to reinstall because this is an older folder I had moved to a backup drive.
---
No I don't think we will load in the same scene. I guess we will probably called onto some sort of mourning ceremony for the soldiers that died, and everything will be sort of dreary and sad, and then the next big thing happens.
---
It's not, but close. The sinister/balth set up is a few % worse. I think overall this is better because if you end up not liking the build you can always reuse the viper armor on a necro or mirage, whereas sinister will likely just rot in your bank.
---
Yup. It was pretty much confirmed from Asura-tech readings that Jormag Energy went dormant along with Primordus.  
---
Which is a damn shame, because I wanted to see the clusterbomb that *two* elder dragons would've caused. :)
---
Have you run any dungeons lately? The mats value is huge and 2-3 veterans in dps builds are enough to blow any elite group to pieces. All that dungeons need right now is objects that are not immune to condi damage. The rest is very reasonable.
---
"I'm not pleased with you for throwing daggers at me like that, but I'm more than willing to teach you better after I backflip through them." 
---
Thirded
---
He's not why we stopped.
---
Considering the tongue of a blue whale is the size of a Volkswagen Beetle, I believe one landing on the server would make quite the dent.
---
Reaper shroud is definitely as close as you can get to swinging Rhaast, and fashion choices if you want to cosplay Kayn are probably most optimal for light armor. Other melee staff playstyles don't really match up as well.
---
&gt; Talk to your closest friend in DnT and just ask them how his attitude and behaviour is affecting the performance of the guild. Show me the content coming from DnT and tell me how a person's attitude and treatment of others doesnt have any bearing on the quality of content a person produces.
---
LOL why don't you tell me since you seem to know.
---
I think the issue is that it doesn't give the best frame of reference, so it's not necessarily apparent at first glance that the thief is in the middle of a flipping maneuver. 
---
Regarding the chack, they do give you a lot of info about them if you just played the events at td. For instance you know they organized themselves in colonies much like the ants. 
---
Regarding chack world boss, idk what Chack Gerent is to you, but to mee seems like a pretty good chack boss. 
---
Rata Novus was a dragon research lab. Doors leading to an even deeper compratment other than the one taimi set her lab? Was not aware of this. Below rata novus only exists deadly shrooms and shits. Either way, one would imagine is just more dragon stuff. If there was smth interesting in there I think it would've been mentioned. 
---
Regarding Modremoth minions, yeah that was a bit left in the dark. I think they are just wandering around the Maguuma now much like the Risen. 
---
One much more interesting thing was the Eye of Janthir and it's relation with Abaddon .. we fought the last Mursaat deep into Abaddon's reliquery I wonder what kind of connection Anet was going for. 
---
So your ren is also a DPS ren who provides alacrity? Pretty sure both dps ren and this FB build are significantly behind "pure" dps builds.
---
I don't think it's fair to say pugs can't do DPS, as an argument for hybrid builds to count as "DPS". I imagine those same pugs won't manage to pull decent boon uptimes, 10k dps and do the required mechanics on this build. 
---
In order for these hybrid builds to compete with "pure" DPS, they need to be significanlty more skilled than the DPS players. That's definitely not unlikely, just gotta set the right expectations for people so they know what to expect. 
---
But if they needed to put more work in and sold them for the same cost, that would cut in on profits, wouldn't it?
---
It was me. I bought a new outfit for my asura and also the world boss teleporter. 
---
Sorry everybody.
---
Lot of DH players don't run a bow. It sounds weird to me but after playing for awhile I just went out and [copied a build.](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Dragonhunter_-_Power_DPS)
---
Which I use currently and have had more fun with it than my previous bow spec. 
---
Picked up the game recently after seeing an Instagram ad (yay marketing) 
---
Does the type of weapon used matter while leveling or is the game designed to let you play around? 
---
Started a necromancer and ended up picking up two daggers and realized the abilities changed- pretty cool. 
---
Mesmer is a totaly fine pick, because its in high demand in every game mode, it just needs an own bag for gear if you min/max and wanna run meta in every game mode.
---
Staff daredevil (thief) is pretty good, it uses medium armor. Revenant also uses staff in melee for the cc I think, and uses heavy armor. Herald is basically just a revenant, you can change back and forth between the two.
---
I'm not sure about reaper, maybe a necro main can help you there, but they use light armor.
---
Having the armor weights in mind you can go to the bank and check skins in the wardrobe to mix and match untill you find something that suits your needs.
---
Should mention that this only counts for PvE and not for PvP or WvW :) 
---
All professions are in meta, you can find builds online.
---
I think i going to try the revenant since it´s completely new to me. In the end i will probably play a few professions to a certain lvl to decide.
---
Thank you very much for your thoughts :)
---
Anet keeps the time gap between episodes to be fairly ambiguous, but often with "some time passed". Probably to make it flow better for those who play them back to back after release. I doubt it will be an immediately after situation, as ArenaNet's never done that. Most episodes feel like "a couple weeks passed since the end of the previous episode", to kind of make it feel like each episode takes a couple days, weeks, or months.
---
Odd, since I got no progress on mine after the patch, when I hit but did not finish the crystal.
---
Seriously! I was so excited to play Druid, I finally get my ranger to 80 and then I hear that fucking sound and immediately knew I couldn’t bear to play the class. Ever. Truly a let down tbh. Turns me away from the game. 
---
Welcome ^^
---
Played the game since beta myself, played all the classes etc!
---
The one bit of advice I'd give is try out all the weapons on whatever class you choose to play.
---
Every weapon has different skills and these can massively change how you play. With warrior, for example, Axe/Axe is very different to sword/sword, which is different to mace/mace, and all of them different to longbow, rifle and greatsword etc. So try them all and find the one/s that are most fun or comfortable for you.
---
If there's a 10k limit per person, I guess my next question is how many accounts can you synchronize to "buy" on the same tick of the gem-gold converter server?
---
But none of them ever ended like that.
---
There was only one race, human. So each profession had two dances. One for male, one for female. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Dance
---
A couple of them matched each other:
---
* Warrior: Combined, male and female dance look like the Pulp Fiction dance with Travolta and Uma Thurman.
---
* Monk: Although their dances are different, when they are put next to each other and timed with *, they will match and do some jumpy moves at the same time. 
---
So at the end of LS1, we got a big reveal that Scarlet had awakened a new Elder Dragon. At the end of LS2, it was revealed that Sylvari were spawn of Mordremoth and the immediate Pact assault on the dragon had failed. At the end of LS3, Balthazar was in Elona.
---
Whatever happens, there needs to be some game-changing reveal. That's how they continue to promote the following content update and keep the story engaging.
---
So yes, I predict some soul searching, some desperate attempt to salvage things, and a big twist that will leave us hungry for LS5. The thing is, it feels like so much *can* happen, I don't really know what exactly I expect from episode six.
---
You realize that renegade + firebrand + warrior + 2 dps is outperforming the chrono + 3 dps in fractals by a fairly noticeable margin? 
---
Gotta love reddit know it alls. 
---
What's the motive for not taking WoR? Sorry, I don't raid so not sure if it's a specific mechanic there that I'm not aware of. Or is it possible to keep perma alacrity without it?
---
I thank you! It's not really a hard work, because music is my passion, and Guild Wars 2 music and sounds and voiceacting just really passionate me, and I'm kind of a nerd. :D
---
Out of curiosity, did anyone play 94 3 or 4 nights ago where the instab Social Awkwardness and Stick Together were matched? I recall taking one look at it and asked my pug to switched to the lower tier daily at 82.
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
Yeah. It would feel better if it was a fast speed increase when entering water, but after leaving the speed would slowly decrease while releasing trails of water behind it. When it runs out of water mist collected over water, it'll slow down.
---
chrono players never got lesser SoI on their buff bars before the trait was removed so by god you are going to feel our pain
---
Did we? I assumed it was the  Auditorium that got trashed, quess that could be a big deal.
---
But resonance crystals there are plenty of right? Don't they also use a few of those in the North meta? 
---
I've geared and tested my Diviner's Firebrand in Fractals for two days now, and have posted my observations on the (gasp) official forums.
---
NB: I'm still stuck on one Minstrel ring since Jalis' Signet Ring bugs out when you attune and/or infuse it, leaving it with a null item name. The stats are still there, but I'm not willing to risk my infusions right now.
---
NB2: In case people are going to mention it, my static group doesn't have strict group compositions. We play and experiment with builds as we like, while being mindful of the importance of certain buffs and support.
---
&gt;Finally finished my set last night (Diviner's with Berserker Shoulders, Gloves, and Boots; Runes of the Pack and Fractal Mobility Potion sets me to 96% Boon Duration; Sword/Shield and Greatsword, both with Sigils of Force and Accuracy; Power DPS food and utilities). Took it for a spin in Fractals with my static. Personal observations as follows:  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I was using Honor instead of Zeal or Virtues for Empowering Might, and may stick with it going forwards. Protector's Impact gives some Protection each time you use Restoring Reprieve, Empowering Might works consistently to generate about 15 Might to the group, and Writ of Persistence makes your Symbol boons far more reliable in messy fights.  
---
&gt;Managed to maintain perfect Quickness uptime in most fights, perfect Fury uptime in fights where people can stay inside Symbol of Blades. Might, as mentioned above, remained around 15-18 stacks from myself. We ran with a Mercy Scourge, so they helped with about 5-6 stacks.  
---
&gt;As far as DPS goes, my fumbling attempts got me about 7-9k DPS on the less annoying fights. This in itself is 2-4 times higher than my Commander Chrono.  
---
&gt;Despite what I mentioned above, there is no need to go Sword and Axe for Fury generation. With Writ of Persistence, you can generate enough Fury with either one to last the duration of a weapon swap.  
---
&gt;I may drop the Shield for a Focus, eventhough that will likely cost me some Bar Break and utility. Shield of Absorption is invaluable for We Bleed Fire, for example.  
---
&gt;That said, I am considering swapping out the Greatsword for a Scepter for more Might generation.  
---
&gt;The lack of Alacrity is definitely something of significance. You can either look for a source of Alacrity, or adjust your group composition to use builds that aren't heavily reliant on Alacrity, e.g. Renegades, Thieves, Mirage, etc.
---
I don't.
---
How many tries did it take you to do that?
---
I've been running a build like this in Fractals lately (Util is Potent Lucent Oil for 140 Concentration): [Link](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQRArd7ensADFChtCBGBDkCjl4Bb/lOT7pWlg8VKoKA0AqXA-jBCBQBB4JAUJ1B0qKPA4kAkH9DFZ/Byq87MKBDAcAcezbezDO/8zP/8z76zP/8zP/8zP/8zHFQgB-e)
---
Since this is for Fractals, you only need to hit 85% BD to cap out with a potion. With that much BD, you don't need FMW to max out Quickness, either.
---
Your considerations on Perfect Inscriptions were a good idea, since the 864 Power team amp post-break is honestly way more damage than I could skip on; I've found that good teams get more damage out of that than I do with the crit chance from RI. Weighty Terms over Stalwart Speed is also a great pick in this case; you shouldn't have any Quickness issues at all since you can already hit 100% uptime without *any* BD, so this just allows you to pump more Aegis and (since I swapped to Elite mantra) Retal + Stability. It also boosts your Might output, which lessens the blow from dropping Honor (and you're right about GS not being worth it here without Zeal).
---
The biggest trade-off that what I'm running loses compared to what you linked is that its Fury uptime is weaker. This is sort of intentional since a second player with Pack runes will let your team hit 100% Fury uptime, but if that isn't an option, you can bring either the Axe or the Sword to maintain 100% if that's not an option.
---
one thing which really matter is - as others points out - how much "time" pass between episodes. To be few days, weeks or even months seem unlikely, as where is logic behind it?
---
Second thing is -if and how Aurene return. I watched WP video on topic and he was rigth about one very important thing -Aurene was ultimate "deux-ex-machina". She was/is becoming eldar dragon and she gettting way too powerfull to be our pet, no matter how much we like to have her around. So presuming either lich magic to resurect her or she got into mist to get more powerfull (ascension)- she must be changed in such way she can be always around us helping any time we need it. Of course there is this whole idea -ok she is gone, go figure something else.

So I dont really know.... but as I always said, I never try predict or wish for anything. Hype is good, but getting hype train crash making many people sad. So i will sit here, playing game and waiting what we get in next episode ..next LS5 .. and really curios about expansion (new spec, new maps and really curios about next big thing (as was gliding for HoT and mounts for PoF)
---
It's got its own category and all. And we are not sure all of them are there:
---
https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Category:References_to_Monty_Python
---
Have you heard about our lord and savior, tactical down ?
---
Hmm. Maybe it the 1440 then? I'm only on 1080. I have reflections on all and a mix of high to low for the rest. 
---
Did you overclock at all?
---
One thing that helped a ton (but makes everyone look invisibile a lot), is moving model limit to lowest.
---
I feel many people were wooshed here.
---
Once you're able to weapon swap, I typically recommend having a ranged weapon and a melee weapon available to swap between. The general rule of thumb in GW2 is that melee weapons *typically* do more damage than ranged weapons to make up for the lack of safety that melee typically has. 
---
Dagger is core Necro's best option as a melee weapon, and running either axe or staff as a ranged option will be fine. Axe will do more damage, but is a little more single target focused. Staff is better at hitting groups of enemies, but its damage is lower due to it being more of a utility-focused weapon. Still, staff will have tools that you might find useful, such as crowd control and a skill to remove conditions from yourself and transfer them to enemies.
---
Warhorn/Focus/Dagger are all good offhand weapons. Warhorn has a nice damage skill/life force generator, and a good CC skill. Focus has good boon removal and damage. Dagger offhand is used more as a condition weapon, but it has a condition transfer that is generally good.
---
You can use these interchangeably to suit your needs, or to upgrade your stats as you get better weapons. You realistically don't need to worry about getting an ideal setup until you reach level 80, so take the opportunity while leveling to try out different weapon combos and utility skills to see what works for you. A lot of improvement in endgame is knowing all aspects of your class and the situations it can be useful in, so learning early can help with your transition into endgame PvE and other game modes.
---
It's not just on firebrand, every class needs that.
---
We can see useless buffs in combat like banners and guild bonuses, but we cant see trait and sigil/rune cooldowns? 
---
Try out all the weapons, skills, and traits when you are learning a new class. Use them and see how they work best. Leveling is easy in this game but the combat system and your class is important to master.
---
In general, I would say that axe/warhorn and staff are good for leveling. But anything can work.
---
Perhaps you can find more suggestions at metabattle.com
---
hey look at all the new cont- oh nvm
---
That's what *survival of the fittest* means! Only those who can adapt survive!
---
git gud*
---
Don't you know how to spell?
---
Yeah, I was confuused that they just didn't give an x duration speed boost that refreshes when over water. That would let you move over land for a short time before it runs out, and would refresh if you hit another patch of water.
---
I don't know why we didn't just get a qol update to show/hide everything. Every weapon that stows on the back ruins back pieces. Maybe there's some nasty foot bacteria they're having a hard time getting rid of that shoes prevent.
---
I made the ascended sword last night, used the mystic forge recipe to change the stats to berserker's. So, yes? You do have to change the skin back though as this process changes the appearance of the weapon.
---
When everyone gets full XP from fighting the same monster, it encourages players to fight monsters together because they can kill more monsters faster, gaining XP faster as well.
---
Across all game modes its probably guard or warrior that are 'the most meta'
---
Hmm, so why is mimic taken over Well of Recall here?
---
Awesome! Thanks! Looks like I was headed in the proper direction. I’m not one for min/maxing- but I like to know where the end points of a class are. 
---
I have been guilty of that before, but maybe I can offer some insight into why some of the more experienced players do this.
---
These days, I raid simply for the FUN. Raid rewards are pretty terrible as it stands, and only get worse after you’ve cleared it for the week. When I raid (especially the rare times I get to play DPS), I do it to have fun practicing/getting used to the different classes, do my job and role in the team, and I do enjoy carrying sometimes.
---
However, occasionally you get groups where you are the only one doing any good damage, or when your supports are literally useless (I’ve had chronos that don’t give any boons, can’t survive for more than 30s before downing again, and do absolutely no damage). While I’m usually quite friendly, I can’t stand people who are not only useless, but refuse to talk/communicate at all, only hoping for a free carry. When repeated attempts to help/communicate with them fail, I ask for the commander to replace them so that the rest of the group can have a more positive experience.
---
It is when the commander vehemently defends said leech and expects everyone else to just carry them that I end up leaving the squad. I just don’t want to be forced to carry someone just because I joined that group.
---
Then again, my static just carries me every week...
---
#OF DALARAN
---
Coming back from the dead is what we are good at lol.
---
At this point. Honestly I won't be surprised if some Eldritch Horror creature visits us and help us. 
---
I seriously want to see Lovecraftian creatures in this game. 
---
Hey dont delete any old characters due to the bday bonuses.
---
Also, roll warrior if you like melee. The hardest part will be learning different mob attacks (some creatures stun, blind, etc making it hard for melee). It takes a week or so but then you'll get the hang of it. Currently the meta for open world pve is axe/axe + mace/mace (to break stun bars). I dunno much about mesmers but I imagine it's easier to range
---
I feel like the fact that she ate Joko will come into play in some manner.
---
i don't get the need for a better visual tell
---
besides seeing the actual birds on you, the icon on your buff bar and the damage ticks you also get constantly blinded
---
so seeing "miss!" on all your abilities should be a pretty good tell
---
I agree. However if the group is trying to communicate/the leech realizes he isn’t doing so well and tries hard and puts in the effort, I will do all I can to help them get the kill :) as long as they don’t have the intention of just being a useless leech, I’m more than happy to give a helping hand
---
In my opinion it would be lame if we just resurrected her. Now that she is in the mists, she might be able to fight Kralkatorrik from there (maybe alongside her mother), now that he has the power to enter and exit the Mists. Then she will probably take Kralkatorrik's place as an Elder Dragon.
---
Absolutely, even if you don't plan on min-maxing it at least helps to know what your class is capable of.
---
I forgot to mention scepter; it's a great weapon but it is condition damage focused. That's not inherently a bad thing, but as I mentioned before, it can be stat/trait reliant. In this case, you probably wouldn't start seeing the actual potential of scepter until you start unlocking specializations for Necromancer later on.
---
If you start leveling other classes, the same general rule of thumb can be applied to them (obviously they'll have differences in regards to weapon usage). You'd follow the same process with them; you'd try different combinations of weapons, see what's ranged/melee (you'll be surprised at some of them!), what does condi or power damage, what is more utility focused, etc. 
---
I have never heard of the menu screen using higher poly models. My charr look like potatoes both in game and in the menu
---
New meta: dressing dumpy to not stand out.
---
Now your gaudy wardrobe choices and living traffic light aesthetics warrant your murder! In the name of *style*!
---
let's not make it a habit tho
---
&gt; You realize that renegade + firebrand + warrior + 2 dps is outperforming the chrono + 3 dps in fractals by a fairly noticeable margin? 
---
Yes I do. And that "outperformance" is using firebrand builds which are full zerk / scholar with almost full DPS traits. It also doesn't actually maintain 100% uptimes for longer fights in most realistic scenarios, and thus relies on high burst. 
---
Unlike this FB build which is full diviner with pack and honor traitline. 
---
But hey, why not ignore the fact that this build puts 1k+ stats into boon duration and loses several DPS modifiers; then pretend it'll have the same performance as the ones posted by SC. 
---
&gt; Gotta love reddit know it alls. 
---
It's funny how you didn't add anything to the discussion. You presumed to be an expert because you read the SC post yet you didn't notice literally all the gear, a traitline and utility options are different and then somehow called other people reddit know it alls. 
---
I'm hoping they don't keep her as an allie, and use her more as a WoW styled Lich King, the new one.  She would be the substitute to the Elder Dragons but would be neutral in the state of the world, literally keeping the balance without the extremes.
---
Maybe should have included /s but I don't think it needs it at this point lol. 
---
Death good!
---
This has to do with the potency of ten man SoIs in raid comps.
---
Two chronos with double well puts the group at like 160% alac uptime and 110% quickness uptime. Mimic, even without the ability to reset its CD, is still strong. With mimiced SoI instead of WoR, the group is at around 130% for both quickness and alac, has bonus uptimes on other boons, and the chronos are less reliant on BD as an additional plus.
---
Your comics gave me a new appreciation of Sieran. First time I met her in game, I disliked her. Now I don't know why.
---
I remembered that there is a lot of bugs when you do story with someone else who made other choice.  
---
Either you rebranch on their story, or you're not getting credited as making the same choices than them.  
---
Sigh. Why would i talk about in-fight dps when they are talking about potential dps? Pugs reach that on "potential" in raids it is even worse on some fights with mechanics. You seem to want to sound smart, you don't.
---
If OP talks about pure bench dps, i'll too. A pug can take a meta class and bench less than 25k, which is much lower in actual raids. If they took a 25k bench, they'd bench as i said 16-17k and in raids it'd be even worse which would make you reach enrages. Since you are almsot never 10ppl throughout the fight to begin with in pugs.
---
So yes, if you bench 16-17k, you'd hit enrage timers. People **already hit enrage timers sometimes** in pugs. Reddit raid experts are at it again.
---
And if having boss kills will somehow make you "respect" what i say more (idk why that'd matter) 1737 insights here. So yes, i actually raid. Do you? :)
---
Have you tried testing it with autoattacking off?
---
Aaaah, Weighty Terms! It all makes sense now: 12 * 0.8 * 0.75 = 7.2 seconds recharge. I was wondering why they reduced the cooldown of Liberator's Vow from 8 to 7 seconds... still doesn't explain the same change on Stalwart Speed given you can't take it with Weighty Terms, but at least part of it makes sense.
---
But yes, that seems like a good change, definitely worth considering. Thanks for the input :3
---
_I want buffs everywhere_ - person on the internet
---
When I'm looking for the healthiness/population of a game I take a look at the reddit numbers. How many subscribers, how many new posts, how many active people and so on. Currently gw2 and ff14 are pretty even, above is wow, a bit below eso. 
---
I have to agree with you on almost all of the points. The main point of disagreement I have is that SA is the second worst instability in the game for one simple fact, it punishes good play (when multiple people does so) and takes away your agency. I cannot accept that if I perform actions correctly someone else can push me in such a way that I fail. Simple example is Arkk cone attack, Siax CC safe spots (even worse with TT), and Gladiator (you could be pushed into the daze attacks). For as much fun as it is to occasionally grief your friends, I think it is not a good instability at all.
---
I would also like to add that it is a nightmare to prestack at mistlocks, so maybe having it be disabled outside of combat or around a mistlock would solve that one problem.
---
As for Slippery Slope I think you can save it, well only kind of. Firstly it should not be active outside of combat. Secondly any knockback, launch, movement skill, and so on should ignore any momentum and not grant you any momentum. This way you could actually use movement skills without them missing and make it so that the adds on Skorvald does not just knock you repeatable off the platform. I think in theory it could  be good to have some form of Slippery Slope in fractals, but I cannot say that this current implementation is even remotely good.
---
i remember spending a good 10min just for the loading screens from constant rerolls.
---
sounds more like your physical button is malfunctioning. only ever had such issues when i used thr button for push to talk, and the mouse neared it's 8 year threshold.
---
And how do you come to the conclusion that players alienating from a class leads to players quitting? I've alienated from my main (Guardian) multiple times but that didn't stop me from playing something else.
---
They can't be equally good if they provide completly different content and gameplay experience. 
---
Not a single person I know quit the game? Chrono is still meta in raids and many love the new firebrand/rene matchup in fracs.
---

Something like body swap thingy. Aurene is now in Kralkatorrik body and s/he retreated because she was in shock. I just dont buy the whole "She got killed" thing. But hopefully we will move on to the other dragons first because im quite tired of branded enemies. Perhaps Steven come to destroy LA and we failed to protect the city and BAM! Kralk shows up in the last moment and help us. And it will be explained in Ep6 that Aurene is now Kralk plus we get a new/the old LA back.
---
2 trys
---
Oh sorry, that's not what I meant.  
---
I thought about creating a poll online, but thought comments work as well.
---
most of my friends that Chrono'd were getting really burnt out with the game anyway.  It was high past time for some of them to pick up another class or take a break for a few months. 
---
That's a lot of words that all amounts to literally:
---
* I had fun in HoT
---
* My friend enjoyed PoF
---
* Tell me your thoughts
---
I quit the game, but that's because i'm WvW mesmer and it's now useless.
---
pof was more refined in terms of map design, story, and general direction. ANet knew what they were going for and had more time. however in terms of replayability HoT wins by miles. decently timed metas with worthwhile rewards and long term relevance.
---
I'm gonna need some sources for that claim my man. If anything I'm more interested in support chrono now than I have been for a long time.
---
he doesnt even carry any treasure! we just a wandering greedy psychopath who kills anything that carry literally anything.
---
Balthazar
---
Skippery Slope. I'll never play it again.
---
also gonna add that heart vendors are account bound this time, you cant complete them to get branded masses daily on your alts :(
---
PoF had a smoother and more polished launch, probably due to everything they learned from HoT but there's probably more things to do in HoT after the initial discovery.
---
I did. Eventually I said fuck it with Stick Together and stood a bit away. 5 players crowding a small spot bumper car-ing each other was not fun.
---
yeah, characters look a lot better at character-select, so I would also like this option
---
Hey there, main DH here 😊
---
Longbow might be a funny weapon but it is definitely not a consistent one.
---
The optimal combination is GS, Scepter/Focus (used to be Scepter/Torch before). With Scepter you will have a little less range than with longbow but significantly more damages due to the 2 (symbol), fast AA and focus 4/5.
---
Sigils are +5% damage and +3% damage / +7% on knocked down foes. With just this you’ll do ton of damages.
---
For utilities, pick procession of blades, the power signet and blade of justice. Ult obviously is the trap.
---
So, this far you have the skills, now how to use it. The best rotation opens on Scepter focus. 5, 2 weapon switch. Procession of blade, F1, Ult, GS 4/2, AA chain. Weapon switch 2/4, blade of justice. 
---
With this “simple enough” rotation, you’ll destroy most of the foes you can encounter. I hope I answered you question !
---
PS: full zerk, superior rune of the scholar.
---
Make the Reaper GS. Dark Harvest looks amazing (IMO the best looking elite spec weapon from HoT). The real prize of the collections are actually the skins, the ascended weapons are just a bonus
---
That entirely depends on what you define as 'active'. See this response: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ag66tz/gw2_population_right_now/ee4jxuq/
---
Non mais je vise à être aussi bonne :^) 
---
There aren't any high res models used for the character select screen. The difference is that the character select screen uses higher resolution textures with different materials for hair, which also uses alpha blend transparency rather than the 1-bit alphas used in-game. 
---
Do people only use one character? I'm confused why would anyone quit over this
---
Special enemy you can kill once a day that has like a 0.001% chance of dropping Invisible Shoes.
---
It was the right thing to do.

The guy spamming map chat about how anet can't make a game thinks otherwise.

&gt; Shacknews: What can players expect from the Living World in the near future?
---
&gt; Mike Z: We are starting to ratchet things up, bigger threats, bigger villains, if you can imagine that on top of what we've done just recently. The promise that we're making players right now is that this season, we are planning to release a new mount that players weren't expecting.
---
- [Mike Z Interview](https://www.shacknews.com/article/107195/guild-wars-2-sixth-birthday-interview-mike-zadorojny-talks-the-living-world)
---
This interview came after the GW2 anniversary and Episode 3 where we already got the Roller Beetle mount so the theory is we'll get one last episode for this season with a new mount.
---
this is what I was thinking. It doesn't have actual elonians aside from the corsairs and therefore there is no established bounty board. But I guess it wouldnt not make sense to establish one. 
---
&gt; The name of 'Guild Wars' comes from the backstory of the original game
---
No, the name comes from the original game being very PvP oriented. The whole lore explanation is made up after the fact.
---
The chrono nerf kind actually made me play mesmer. Loving my condi mirage since peiple dont scream "U SUCK GIT GUD META"
---
And i even hit raid dps numbers :3
---
Just remember what ol’ Jack Burton does when the earth quakes, and the poison arrows fall from the sky, and the pillars of Heaven shake. Yeah, Jack Burton just looks that big ol’ storm right square in the eye and he says, “Give me your best shot, pal. I can take it."
---
Regarding your last point, don’t fret about changing your gear right away. While Diviner’s allows for more DPS with the same amount of Boon Duration, that does not mean that Commander’s isn’t usable. 
---
If it takes you awhile to make the Diviner’s stuff, that’s fine. Chrono DPS is not that important in the grand scheme of things. I understand that it is frustrating, but don’t assume your gear is obsolete just because a better alternative shows up. 
---
1. Yes definitely, would be the better nerf for SoI.
---
2. Nah, a slight increase would be ok I guess with a trait just like that on guards sigills(?)
---
3. Well, then don't metasheep on SC and look for a beter variant. Full Harrier has always been a good alternative boonwise (not damage of course) for semi-activ/not minmax raiders
---
It is. But at the same time, this episode did feel like an end to me. While I was playing it and did not know yet it should be the last episode, I was surprised that we are actually fighting Kralk, as it felt very end of the season and I expected us just making preparations in this one.
---
Not really if you imagine draining kralk means the magic has to go somewhwre. Why not aurene? Elder dragons are essentially giant sponges anyway.
---
I am totally with you about the branded enemies. Don't you think having an elder dragon ally would be a little too... deus ex machina, though?
---
The lore references the game title, not the other way around.  
---
This roul guy can only flame what a rat
---
This is a great idea, that's one of the reasons why I'm I don't find myself using the skimmer often (which sucks because I love it visually) 
---
thief, specifically daredevil
---
you can spec invigorating precision, signet of malice, spam dodges, spam blinds and stealth past anything you don't want to fight..it's also top tier for farming open world mobs with shortbow during stuff like pala meta
---
ignore the plebs recommending necro: it's the slowest profession, you will be stuck in combat forever(especially if you run minions), no way to avoid any form of strong attack besides 2 dodges and soaking with shroud..did i mention besides golem and maaaybe shadowfiend minions deal basically no damage? and if you spec for minions into death magic your dps will be even worse!
---
necro is great if you want to power through content while half asleep but if you don't wanna waste hours moving slowly and killing even slower pick something fast and with active defenses
---
If you think ppl already don't hit enrages in pugs (low dps + ppl dying + losing support boons + whatever else) you have literally 0 clue about the community of this game so i see 0 point in saying anything else. Enjoy your imagination.
---
symbols
---
The undeniable inspiration for the new instability.
---
I like the sword skin.  It's Caithe's Bloom Dagger but the crystal makes it longer and into a sword.  That's a nice touch.
---
https://imgur.com/a/fMyTVmV
---
Oh wow that actually looks really good, ESPECIALLY the shoulders, thanks!
---
&gt; led to a huge amount of players quitting.
---
No, it didn't.
---
That wouldn't have moved it to 243 in a few minutes. Even when super high demand stuff like character slots and shared inventory slots were on sale it only went from 125 to like 140 , not up to 245 . 
---
Lmfao everyone being picky about “high-poly”, OPs point is Select Screen is clearly higher quality and he wants an option for that in game, who cares how it’s done.
---
Do it with 20 accounts at the same time maybe it will work.
---
Ty, fixed. 
---
That wouldn't cause that huge of a spike, even when huge sellers like character slots and shared inventory slots go on sale , it doesn't jump like that , just rises a little.
---
&gt; slippery slope isn't bad. some players are
---
Come on, man.
---
Oh yea definitely, it just that i dont get the concept of the elder dragon. i mean, they exist to eat the overflowing magic in this world so it doesnt blow up right? then whats the point of killing each other if they are needed?
---
Could be. There is a question about this on the official forums for questions about this episode, so maybe we will know on Friday.
---
I believe this is also the case for the new shield. 
---
Q&amp;A on [https://www.twitch.tv/frostball99](https://www.twitch.tv/frostball99) for 2 hours or so.
---
Hahahahaha! How long did it take you guys to do the whole frac? Did you get one-shot? Any of your partymates bumpered others off the platforms while you were jumping?
---
Exactly. The Jahai release felt like they hit everything at full. Great story, great map, great events, great achievements. Now this feels like the story was all they focused on and the map is just the stage, it's not its own thing to explore and enjoy. some of it is natural. After all, it would be weird to have some thriving underwater city or some shit, it makes logical sense that the waters are dead and empty. But there's so much empty space! Also, secondary nitpick, but the Dredge heart doesn't even extend south far enough to make hunting branded Dredge worthwhile for the heart.
---
Thanks, changed the numbers!
---
Even if this is true, which it isn't, it would be a tremendous amount of work to implement. You can't just swap out models like that unless you built the system to allow for it, which they didn't. I can only imagine how many issues the animation retargeting could cause. 
---
Also the reason the characters look better in the selection screen is because of the lighting quality.
---
Look at this screenshot I just took from the character screen. See how the fingertips are flat and the fingers seem square, almost cubic? It's because they are just made of rectangles basically, with a normal map to make them look a bit rounded, but it doesn't do a very good job upon close inspection. The normal map is made from the high poly model, and applied to the low poly. https://i.gyazo.com/e286ffe187bdd69ff47e81f119343925.png
---
I really dislike outfits. I really just wish that they would release them as armor skins. 
---
I am dealing with the same issue and wanted to know this as well. I have to say I am not amused by the long wait times. I understand I am not the only one whom has submitted a ticket, but out of the other games I play, this one seems to be taking an awful long time. 
---
Are you this weaver in my girlfriends fractal group today that tried to kick a reaper for being a "leech", ended up being kicked yourself then kept rejoining the same group over and over again just to get kicked over and over again?
---
Are you trying to say the new instability is cancer?... I'm confused.
---
Wrong, 3 of the Gen 2 weapons still have a collection. The concept was abandoned with LWS3, up to now (with likely only the greatsword missing). 
---
And we are still in Gen 2, so we cannot say for sure what the "beyond" will look like.  
---
Renegade with kalla elite is the true OP thing about heal renegade in PvE. You only switch to ventari to fill your energy on kalla again ;)
---
Till when will LS2 be on sale? I want to buy, but i’m short on cash atm.
---
Thnx for any info
---
I'm okay with it. Their options are WAY more limited, they will have no infusions or legendaries, and they aren't going to be any stronger for it. 
---
adding onto this, I believe since they added the fury effect Axe 2 has stopped working with the "Symbols burn foes" trait and Symbolic Avenger in Zeal.
---
Sounds great— so it sounds like to go for power until 80 where I can start looking at builds. I like the idea of working towards a condi playstyle as a necromancer, but I guess I’ll need to see what groups want from a necromancer in party comps 
---
As far as I know, the char selection screen just bypass the "High-Res Character Textures" so it's always enabled in that screen. Some hair/beard do look better, but it's just due to the way it renders transparency. No polygons affected.
---
The other dagger was left with the last person in which it was used.
---
So many parts of this outfit look amazing. I'd buy it in a heartbeat if it was an armor set. 
---
Thanks for this!  If you don’t mind me asking, how do you code the colors for the timer?
---
Learn to dodge.
---
Find out which attacks are dangerous and be prepared to deal with those. 
---
If you’re using Arcane Blast / primordial stance, swap those with Arcane Shield / the barrier giving weaver stance.
---
If you need to, swap your traits around in the open world for better survivability (blinds upon burning, etc) and understand what your traits can do.
---
The builds you see are generally builds optimized for group play, where you have buffs and heals and supports to block for you.
---
I’d even recommend trying to copy some PvP traits and utilities if you need to, as those builds are usually more defensive than PvE builds.
---
At the end of they day though, once you get good at dodging elementalist is one of the highest dps classes that you can use :)
---
Yes, it was the right thing to do. 
---
Not buffing power alacrity renegade at the same time was the mistake. The raidscene was ready for a change, but now we are back to the same old double chrono, one druid comp thats just plain boring after 2 years of it. And no, diviners gear is NOT a buff to power alacrity renegade, its just revealing the true problems of that build (no burst, too short alacrity base duration, too high energy costs).
---
We did. We just got two sets in the previous chapter, and we are getting pieces of the corsair set through the season.
---
good content frostyball99, maybe i will resubcsribe, but still you need to gain your respect back after the deimos griefings... :P haha
---
You are a necro, you don't need to think twice about trying something new. Necros can even level without using any weapon (not recommended).  Every weapon has it's own benefit e.g. staff has long range, dagger let's you siphon health etc. 
---
No, all PoF legendaries don't have collections.
---
I remember when I thought 5-7 gold for 100 was too expensive for my taste :( lol
---
Only the first 4 gen 2 and the original gen 1 weapons have collections. 
---
To start on Pharus talk to Grandmaster Hobbs and look for the weapon Recipe for Exitus
---
No, she is just hard to come by.
---
You forgot one, because there are four - nevermore, astralaria, hope and chuka
---
Stalwart speed activates with any skill that generates aegis or stability, which means that it can accidentally be activated from something like "stand your ground" or from shield 4 when you don't mean to, so it would be nice to see it at least 
---
Oh boy, tradable, that's totally an incentive for people to farm the five possibly instances of treasure mushrooms that exist _per daily_ once a day for a comedically rare chance at objects so ignored by this point don't have a tangible value below 4 thousand gold.
---
Though there are like 6 of them on various HoT maps, so 6 chances a day.
---
poor thing D:
---
Hey!  
---
Thanks for your reponse.  
---
The people with less games are not displayed on my page, but for example rank 20 got 66 wins and 56 losses which means 122 played games.  
---
Check following screenshot for this:

and here I'm still waiting to be able to mount without losing a tome
---
The tablet does need to stop at times though. If you can get the tempo of the fight and restacks correct it can work in WvW. But honestly there are builds that just do this better these days :(  
---
The alacrity is nice since the mesmer nerfs though \^\^  
---
They don't necessarily mean you need to be the still. The ones you're healing are the ones that need to be still.
---
Try using it to heal someone who's moving in game. Really difficult. In WvW, you rarely stand still and that's where the stance's downfall is.
---
its random
---
Stance is in the name ;-)
---
In my experience, toxic players remove themselves if you just ignore them. 
---
Clear instructions and good use of markers make a good commander. Not kicking players that dont conform. As long as those toxic player do what you tell them to do, they dont hinder. Everyone has a block function, so if it gets too much for them, they can block him/her.
---
Sometimes it's just the combinations of instabilities that are a pain. Deepstone with birds, we bleed fire and vindicators is just mean
---
It's a powerful PvE healer, but it requires a little more awareness and better positioning than playing w/ a Druid.  It can do either 25 might or solid alacrity, but is a little less practical w/ regard to might.  You can either run Ventari w/ Herald or Renegade so there are some options.  I think most people prefer renegade because kalla is pretty powerful.  
---
Because axe pull is cool, I forgot that empowering might != phalanx strength, so yes - and I can't aesthetically mix and match different gear sets.
---
So we can be reminded of how it was once a good trait.
---
Just a joke post tbh, hence the description
---
Wait, does that mean we get lunar new year patch next week already? Because thats about it in terms of added stuff from All or Nothing?
---
May even be able to Bond of Faith from the top of a spring jump
---
The technology isn't there yet.
---
Yeah, you know, i find roaming boring. I'm more of a GvG guy.
---
"Would be a shame to see Awakened ignored, Elona abandoned and Sunspears forgotten"
---
If you expect otherwise... well
---
You are an idiot. That's just being utility bitch. What about real fun? FIGHTS?
---
yes those are all valid reasons to leave, even more so when whoever leaves is the same person that caused problems
---
what bothers me is the scenario where a boss is perfectly doable but mistakes happen..and it's enough for 1 person to leave to start a chain reaction
---
and it bothers me because it takes forever for squads to fill up sometimes so a lot of time gets wasted including the person's that left..it just seems like a short-sighted decision
---
Legendary helmet?
---
YouTube has ruined me. :(
---
Now all I see is a giant hilt with a giant guard
---
Would love any comments or criticism for this! I was pretty inspired by the latest episode and decided to make a dedication to our Aurene.
---
We are looking at a late 2021 release for the next expansion, maybe 2022. 
---
If we don't get the depths then I am going to wager we never get it. 
---
Isn't that the general system that they have in place now or are you memeing
---
I wouldn't mind an alternative to the ugly fish ...
---
Because it's better quickness uptime and further decreases reliance on boon duration.
---
With WoR you provide excessive amounts of alacrity in raid comps, and quickness is a lot tighter. Mimiced SoI, even without the CS resets, provides a nice quickness buffer without sacrificing too much alacrity.
---
Additionally, with over 70% uptime on squad covered by SoI at that point, chronos can afford to run much lower boon duration if they want.
---
Yet another bug
---
Aren't we all ,👍🏻
---
Heart of Thorns in 2015/2016 =/= Heart of Thorns after the [Spring Quarterly patch](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spring_2016_Quarterly_Update) or after PoF which introduced mounts. 
---
Honestly, replacing her if she is that hard to get would be a better option than no zojja.
---
Living world didn't start till sign fixer the game in january. 
---
They were still on monthly patches as being an idea back at launch. 
---
Sigh... they had to make it an outfit :(
---
Axe is almost compatible to scepter, so as a fury option it’s pretty great on power FB actually. 
---
Knight is never good for min-maxing, it's just more convenient.
---
It barely factored into HoT... 
---
You know not everybody has the same good vision as you might think.  
---
So let me try to explain.   
---
With so many visual noise going on people can't see the birds. You should try it on a really small Asura...  
---
The icons on the buff bar are a joke. Too small and constantly moving and pushing each other, besides that they are very bad placed on the screen.  
---
And there are many things that trigger the blinded miss, which by the way is also hard to see with so much going. 
---
So did 5 of season 3. 
---
Hopefully they confirm. Because before they said we were half way at episode 3. 
---
It was on the table.
---
Me.
---
Ah, so the very tiny specific part of WvW that you like then, rather than WvW as a whole? It is also rather useful to have mesmers in GvGs still...
---
Man this thread is like Marmite, 80 something comments, hovering at 5 upvotes. What's happening?  
---
I think I bought my first Bank tab for like 32s back at launch lol
---
I had goosebumps the whole time. I got to say that the ending seems a bit anti-climatic but maybe that is what you were going for.
---
Yes, you can actually see a history of the sales on the wiki. It occasionally goes on sale at around 30% off.
---
This is usually as part of large sale events though, like the anniversary celebrations.
---
I love that WP noticed Logan's new armor during his playthrough and guessed he's its gonna be an outfit. Well played, dude!
---
Name it "recap" or similar. 
---
As a recap it bumps up to 3
---
/5 for me. 
---
It didnt dwell too much on story that wasnt extremely relevant and it got the overall emotions quite well. 
---
Sorry if I came off as harsh but its literally the basics of the basics we are talking about here.
---
Yeah it's maybe not the best fix, but it's what I came up with.  
---
But we definitely need something better that the actual slippery slope... I don't mean to remove it completely but some way to keep it more manageable .   
---
What bothers me besides finding it anti fun is that we don't have ways to counter it.  
---
People being directionally challenged wasn't an issue with the map design imo.
---
Even the event design lead people through the maps really well (not that they are all that big). I personally think the bigger issue was a lack of leadup. Something like auric basin would have been a better starting map than verdant brink was.
---
It seems to be permanently on sale
---
It was fine before mounts. The maps are small and filled with shortcuts.
---
, even more once wallows are unlocked.
---
Springerwith new mastery works  
---
Griffon without the mastery works as well  
---
Same with raptor
---
I wasn't aware that you can buy them at the TP, so now I totally agree, that's a waste. 
---
No griffon needed! I used a bunny and bond of faith to glide over. But make sure your have the bunny mastery that gives you the highest possible jump. 
---
since there are MANY things that affect the visual fidelity, it's good to be specific.
---
Relevant username
---
sure, it's generally something around 50 gold per episode, plus or minus some. If you do fractals, that's maybe half a week per episode. If you unlock LWS4E1 first, that gives you istan which is the best gold farm out there right now, which can get you 50 gold in a few hours if you stay on it
---
Rev is energy management oriented while ele is cooldown management oriented. I love both of them but I found rev to be easier to play by far and have a better general qol in open world pve. I have no experience with raids and little experience with fractals. Right now I’m still on the sword ele train with weaver but my previous main was herald. Either one is a good choice but I guess comes down to personal preference 
---
If this is the case then it might make sense if a few people jumped past OP in rating but the leaderboard never did a final refresh after the end of the season.
---
For real, as soon as Caithe got her make over my first thought was "CRYSTAL GEM STORE SKINS INCOMING"
---
But I would pay 500 gems and I would pay 500 more just to be the man who gets to mix'n'match
---
HoT legendaries* these are still technically a feature of the previous expac.  
---
Was still a good gesture of Anet to make them avaialable through PoF as well though.
---
I would really appreciate it if the next episode didn't begin on the comms. Every episode so far has begun with the commander making a call to someone who then gives them a task to do. It would be really powerful if nobody called us this time round. Instead, it would be good if the player character took initiative instead to begin the story.
---
As does Chuka &amp; Champawat 
---
I was gonna say, due to how beefy you are this might actually be faster even with the small amount of do reduction. 
---
Guys, sorry but what is Diviner stats? Power, Precision, Ferocity and Concentration? Haven't been able to play the new episode yet.

There is always this annoying person
---
it can activate even from fractal 100 special button giving you aegis after the jump. Which is pretty dumb, can never use it as quickbrand atm to go back to boss after phases you have to run yourself or rip quickness.
---
I feel you. What should have been an obvious thing from all the visions we saw that Aurene ran us through at the end of the previous episode, it made it feel like we ignored her warning.
---
"You need to kill him!" Glint said.  
---
"This is your moment to strike!" she said.
---
Well, your daughter's dead... so now what? Did you really plan that too? Or do I have to throttle your crystallized corpse just to prove a futile point?
---
Something tells me that the Commander would be upset with Glint for putting the both of us in this position to begin with. She did set a lot of this in motion, after all. So conflicting.
---
SoI was much easier because it is a much longer CD and the proc of it is tied to cooldowned skills. Much easier to weave it into your rotation. I've played chrono for ever and still do in raids, changed to firebrand in my frac group and really is not same.
---
I believe that's why he's asking about it being a bug. Because it's been confirmed by a few people around here that you CAN get diviners on S3 items, though we shouldn't be able to. 
---
To answer op, I'm not sure if anything has been confirmed either way about this by anet
---
I just want the norn and human beards to be available to each other.
---
Make an underwater mount! Like an Orca that swallows you while "riding".
---
I'm not really sure what the point of linking to an article from 3-4 months ago is? Yay we have the beetle.  Yay races.  Woo. 'Kay? 
---
I don't really know how to use either one so I'm thinking jumping into a level 80 PvNPC experience wouldn't tell me much :\
---
That would be a difficult statement to back up.
---
AFAIK all API endpoints have some sort of caching so no data derived from it is truly a moment to moment snapshot. It is more like summaries of what happened every couple of minutes. 
---
Just a heads up to make sure you reply to the person you're talking to and not the entire thread ^^
---
It's not the same though? 
---
Having it both ways means that the people who want the whole outfit and don't care about mixing and matching can just buy the outfit. And the people who want to use specific pieces can buy the whole armor set.
---
The whole point of why a lot of people want them as armor pieces and not as outfits because when mixing and matching people only usually use ONE or two pieces.  Me, for example, I would love the chest piece. But only the chest piece because that's the only thing that fits the look I had in mind.
---
Now I couldn't care less if I had to pay 2,000 gems for it but as long as I can separate it and USE ONLY THE PIECES THAT I WANT because damn has it been annoying all these years to see various chest pieces, leg pieces, gloves, whatever and see that I can't use them because it's an outfit.
---
Corgi mount!!!
---
Its going to be the NF wurms...
---
I despised the old SA, but that does not mean I will not despise the new SA. This new version suffers the same problem as the old one, in that it punishes you for others actions. I have a fundamental disagreement with this type of design in that it punishes good play (because there is no, in my opinion, legitimate counter play to either version of SA). To me SA is like if a flux bomb is always dropped on the hitbox of a boss, it is just terrible design punishing you for being where you are supposed to be. Additionally it is inherent area denial, which becomes so much worse depending on which encounter you are at.
---
Maybe why I get so pissed at this implementation is that when I play I try to use dodges as few times as possible. I try to move small distances to evade attacks to increase my dps uptime. These actions are taken away from me because of the way SA works. If I play well, someone else will, in almost all likelihood, deny my movement and I will be punished, for no fault of my own. I cannot agree with you that teamwork solves it. No amount of saying "I will stand on the front, you stand 75 degrees to the left hand side" and so on. It will never work. Anytime there is a mechanic that forces movement the last, and also the first, player that moves will almost certainly be punished for it. When I say punished, it does not mean you get killed, nor always get hit by mechanics, but in a sense breaking the fundamental control you have over your character. To me, if someone else takes away my agency, I have already lost, so this is maybe more of a personal disagreement about how the mechanic works, rather than necessarily whether it is a well designed mechanic or not. There is not a single mechanic, mistlock instability (except Slippery Slop), or encounter design that grinds my gears as much as the new version of SA.
---
Instead of just complaining about SA, I should actually consider possible solutions to it. I honestly believe that if you revert SA to the old state and remove the 10% physical damage component of it (so that it only gives agony stacks), it would be completely fine. Then it would simply be a 70% healing reduction modifier impeding your sustain rather than killing you. This is my ideal solution tbh (except just removing it from the game). Alternatively SA could drop a timed AoE on a short CD if too many people are standing ontop of each other. In a sense it is still area denial, but would not kill you quickly, but rather force the people that stacked there to move (you would have to put an icd on it otherwise one player would move into another and trigger a new AoE spiraling out of control). The AoE does not have to be big, like maybe 100 unit diameter, or maybe 150, and deal some damage to disincentive stacking. It could be made to a reverse of Stick Together in that you take more damage if you are close to your allies.
---
At the end of the day, I just disagree with disincentive stacking because of how the game is designed. I disagree with others moving your character constantly. I disagree with punishing standing ontop of other players. As mentioned above, my preferred solution is to remove it.
---
As for the safe area, this would help against slippery slope, flux bomb (after activating the CM on 100 since the agony check can spawn FB), and possibly birds (for the same reason as FB). I just think that these types of mechanics are combat focused mechanics, or should be (in the case of Slippery Slope and SA), rather than a mechanic for simple movement during a fractal. I could see that Slippery Slope should work in certain puzzles, but not at all when standing at a mistlock.
---
only because you morons make the game to something it never wanted it to be, it doesnt mean it has to cater to you. not once did they market this game as fashion wars or a mmo with a big variety of fashion. thats all made up shit from the community.
---
and they told us 4/5 years ago how it would be in the future. outfits in the gem store. armor ingame. and you still are complaining. take it or leave it.
---
Probably Rev.  Elementalist can be very involved and squishy for newer players that don't have dodging mastered.  
---
but you can probably drop a Volkswagen on the roof of Amazon's datacenter without having it fall through so it won't touch the server
---
Indeed.
---
Because it's a fairly old mmo and they have higher things on the priority list. 
---
You have problems. Log out, enjoy life, smoke some weed... 
---
The article is post-beetle.
---
I said that a couple years ago in one of these threads...still waiting :(
---
Also new item in the store.
---
It was datamined as the patch came out. Practically anything that a major NPC has that is unique gets thrown on the gemstore. I think all of the main characters outfits and weapons have been on there. Hardly a one in a million prediction.
---
I don't even use backpieces because Reaper Shroud...
---
Does Logan's Pact Marshell Outfit give a bonus to running away?
---
yeah, I am the "douchy" guy on this sub. sure mate.
---
Same here. I've been having FPS issues and the husband has been having crash issues. 
---
So, I've been looking at several builds for characters I'd like to play, and have noticed that some of the 'optimal builds' aren't really what I'm after out of a class.
---
For example, I would love to play a Guardian with Greatsword and Longbow, just because I like the aesthetic both provide. However it seems that most optimal DPS builds are Greatsword and Sceptre/Focus (at least, according [Meta Build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guardian), which is what I've been told to look at). 
---
Is this a universally accepted site/build, or can I make most weapon choices/builds work and these guides are purely for people trying to push the most optimal DPS etc? 
---
Thanks in advance!
---
The chapters also go on sale from time to time ... at least for LS2, not sure about the others.
---
Why am I getting downvoted for asking a genuine question?
---
She had a baby soon after HoT and was on a break. I don't know what is the situation now, I believe somebody said she tweeted she is willing to come back to voice for GW2.
---
I don't think so, if it operates with other elder dragons going against us and we have one elder dragon on our side. I think that evens things out and makes for some very interesting story possibilities
---
I'm going all in, I think we're getting a mount that allows us to open designated portals into the mist.
---
...kinky
---
Thanks! :D
---
Seems like this is the opinion around. Ele is sweatier and Rev is more relaxed but both are fun to dive into. I think the fact that both of you point a little stronger towards Rev mirrors my initial thoughts, that I will have a better time running around learning how to Rev because of the wiggle room it allows for mistakes.
---
I'll start with the Rev and save Ele for next.
---
just hush, its over, its spoiled now. lets keep my reply box relatively empty, lesson learned.
---
Does anyone have a link to the announced original release date?
---
Also
---
I remember the release being the most disappointing thing ever.... remember the old UI? in the menus anyway, it was terrible
---
Ten years and no build templates.
---
does anyone remember Overwolf? that broke when they changed the UI
---
Now we have Ars dps but i am sure that will break some day 
---
Okay, that's impressive.
---
Well.... you won't even use Longbow (Pharus) because Reaper...
---
Both Asura look creepy af.
---
I'm thinking you are correct. I'm thinking a character with the ability to mess up and not die is more my speed right now, especially after playing Thief as a main for so long.
---
Thanks for the advise :)
---
A unicycle!
---
Close enough :(
---
...if they added a few spots in central Tyria to utilize it, I'd be all-in for it.
---
I love the Jackal, but if the next mount is "portals, but outside these key areas it's a reskinned Raptor/Jackal with slightly different movement", I'm gonna have to pass. One of the key features of mounts is that each has their specific uses. I can let the Jackal slide for the portal thing, but not twice.
---
"emptiness and pain" 
---
oh boi
---
Dlgamer is official retailer? I never get keys from retailers like G2A as they are almost always done through credit card frauds. I believe that means insta-ban in any game.
---
XD  
---
I was not prepared for this kind of answer. Well done ! Upvoted.  
---
Wow, so many matches. That's awesome.
---
XD get snappee
---
How?
---
Teh slat is rael.  :\^)
---
What's that? I'm new :P
---
Same team either way. Hopefully they've had time to learn from their last episode and don't devote as much of the *episodes* resources to the mount. Though I do love the beetle and the story.
---
well, we did convinced them to make the town clothes into an outfit (would be better if it become a skin imo) so lets hope we could convince them about this as well.
---
Tbh you can enter all keeps and most towers with no siege we're gonna make 2 or 3 more videos in the next couple of days
---
i read "unexpected" as a mount no one ever asked for or wanted, ever.
---
`Look at tha booooones!`
---
I make a guess that the most requested mounts are underwater and multiperson (dolyak), which means it's neither of those.
---
It could be how they handle moving the story past the Elder Dragons. I'd assume it's pretty hard coming up with new obstacles when you have literal reality warping players on your team.
---
Dlgamer is not G2a. G2a is a key reseller that doesn't care where their users get the keys they sell. Dlgamer is just like any other retail site, they get keys straight from the developers. 
---
Outfits are the way they are precisely because they are NOT armor. It takes much less time to make an outfit as one piece than to make six separate pieces that have to be checked for clipping, individual dye channels, etc.
---
Power/Conc/Prec/Fero I believe.
---
Glad you're self-aware at least.
---
The Alliance of World of Warcraft would like a word with you.
---
There's a oil turn in point which gives it to you on the ledge where the NPCs all stand, by the huge pipe.
---
I like your idea! It's refreshing to see a group photo that is ingame istead of the character select screen.
---
I think you can improve the impression of your party when you choose a perspective, that focuses more on the characters. The undersight makes the diagonal lines of the structure really strong and the color scheme of the surroundings makes it hard to see your characters as a group. 
---
I'm inspired and will try a similar attempt with my “clan“ soon :D. I already have a spot in mind...
---
Study the jungle and survive. Tangled Depths are the cream of the crop
---
It’s the CharrCar!
---
Fingers crossed! Expansion means new toys!
---
I don't understand why they're so locked into the idea of mounts as the defining feature of PoF &amp; LS4/LS5.  It clearly takes them a ton of focus, and if everything else has to suffer for it, is that really worth it? The beetle is cool and all, but I'd care a lot more if they were more interested in selling meaningful feature, but I guess more mounts = more skins = more $$$$.  Thanks for funding the next expansion y'all... 
---
What mace is that? Any links?
---
I see what you did here.
---
Ah thanks, €20 is a good enough deal. I will be getting the key from them :D Thanks
---
Developers obsess with "mechanics" they invent and want to shove it into as many places as possible. And, unfortunately, the less control the player has over the character the better. Magnetic unblockable / no-stability pulls were bad enough in TO where 5 pixels to the left means insta-death from elaborate telegraphs + extra high adds damage, but now we also slide around. Ridiculous. 
---
I presume primary purpose is to make t4 set of fractals take 2 hours or so, as the only "theoretical" counterplay is "kill everything completely, bring all range classes, be extra tanky". I don't even know if "kill everything" is realistic as many fractals re-spawn adds non-stop. For case of projectile mitigation, I guess we're supposed to stack firebrands with bubbles and have warrior as a spell breaker?
---
I wish we'd get someone to force devs to answer how exactly these combos are balanced. And what the new stats are (as in, do regular pugs say "fuck it, time to stop doing fractals today") on particular combos of instabilities. I mean I don't think that makes "new" fractals easier, but completing 100 (non-CM) with randoms in case of bad instabilities was always a long shot :(. (more skilled players just do it at reset and then you get black lfg in NA or "two out of three" groups waiting for Chrono)
---
[Here's a picture](https://i.imgur.com/u2tbSSF.jpg)

my favorite is ranger
---
Source showing players quitting?
---
Major power and concentration, minor precision and ferocity. Also, most concentration of every combinations to date, full set on its' own gives 77% boon duration.
---
I think if you jump high enough and immediatly use the new mastery, you should be able to get in there.
---
But yes, griffon is an easier way to reach it. Everything is easier with griffon.
---
No problem :) 
---
Mordrem that survived returned normal, but struggling internally for the atrocities thay have done. There was one of them in the zephirite's map that explained this thing, on the top of a peak
---
GW2 isn't built on WoW's engine. That info isn't really relevant. Things like the Trahearne statue and which NPC's you see in Amnoon are mere aesthetic touches. You can do a lot with that tech, but it can only go so far. 
---
Clearly, the Pact isn't using **nearly** enough psychological warfare against the EDs. 
---
cant even do 1 single fight without having enemy models disappear. 
---
I love Zone of the Enders. Let Scruffy be my orbital frame.
---
I honestly prefer the Jackal for general use thanks to handling hills better than the Raptor, and for being able to perform instant turns in any direction using the blink.
---
I played a bit on my alt account today (germany) and saw thst pricing in the gem shop.
---
I want the commander to be blamed, ostracized, cast out of the pact and fallen from Grace, maybe even have some of our own guild turn on us.
---
So much time spent having everyone adore us because we always make the right decision to lead us to victory, we always had a plan and always what to do.
---
Now we don't, I hope that's captured with the story it deserves .
---
I'm saying less than in this circumstance, but yeah, I get what you're saying.
---
Aside from my want for an underwater mount, I also wouldn't mind some kind of stealth-based mount. Either through a stealth-granting ability or cosmetically tunneling underground where enemies can't detect you.
---
Man I feel like you captured what i felt perfectly. For the past couple of patches I have always felt like Anet just hates my way of having fun or something, random instab, no more cm, spammy, untelegraphed, and unmeaningful boss mechanics + attacks, Chrono getting destroyed in fractals when pugging, now these unbalanced instab reworks. 
---
My wake up call was two days ago. For the first time, I jumped into a fractal and actually said to my party: "you know what, I am skipping this one today good luck!". Looking back at it the next day, I actually couldn't believe I went from clearing cm+T4 daily and having tons of fun doing so, to this, skipping a daily T4 fractal cause of cancer. 
---
And then I went to raid on a Sunday even though I full cleared this week already, just to have some fun. Jeez wtf is happening. 
---
I flex a lot in open world but main Necro for fractals and PVP and every time I try something else it's a shocker.
---
It was on sale at the 31st of december 2018 for 560 gems.
---
That was my thought as well , had to be a weird glitch , I've never seen a jump like that , no matter WHAT was coming on sale. And in the middle of the night ? ( For NA at least ) . No way.
---
When you go to website to buy it it's 58 dollars.
---
Thief offhand sword spec confirmed?
---
I like this! 
---
I don't recall the exact ratio , but yeah I was a day 1 player , and I remember maxing out every single thing they sold in the gem store  ( which wasn't much , basically bag slots and character slots ) just by mining Orichalcum and selling it ( before they nerfed Ori to be once every 24 hours )
---
It drops from the chest so yes.
---
I feel like underwater mount is the #1 mount people are expecting at this point though. So I guess it depends whether Mike really meant that or it was just PR speak. I could imagine either.
---
Is it really so hard to use cc skills? blinds, knockdowns, stuns, weakness, slow etc. Imo outflanked is meh at worst because you have to kill more things and use somemore cc BUT the 25% reduced dmg when fighting things head on makes bosses(and alot of trash) ez mode.
---
Meta is 1/day/account. The drops for serpentite everywhere except the dwarven puzzle is rng. Something I noticed a few days ago also: the metas do not drop branded masses (they drop nodes that give an rng chance for masses).
---
Oh I completely agree, I'm biased towards Jackal myself too. It's just, if they have ANOTHER mount whose gimmick is bound to portals only found on the newest maps going forward, it's going to be a bit much. Especially if it shares a very similar jump/dash to the Jackal.
---
Yeah, because having every day more clown like players running around with those exaggerated and over the top skins is definitely healthy for the game and helps the immersion right? While dungeons are dead and forgotten, together with pvp and wvw and a lot of other content 
---
I remember lower than that , I was a day 1 player , there just wasn't really anything to BUY with those gems except bag slots and character slots lolz. And bank slots . But the bank and bag slots were lower maximums too ( 8 bag slots max , and like 9-ish bank not 17 )
---
You joke about that but gold to gems is not a free market. Players don't drive the prices as nobody is choosing how much they buy/sell for. ArenaNet sets the prices with an algorithm that is likely based on trade rates, but obviously has other artificial factors due to the lack of any sort of real inventory.
---
They can and almost definitely do twist the prices to make money.
---
&gt;It clearly takes them a ton of focus, and if everything else has to suffer for it, is that really worth it?  
---
We are talking about Anet. YES, OF COURSE!
---
I'm also not too fond on the mounts continuing. Not that I don't want more but it's not really the "Metroidvania" style of masteries from HOT. I think they gave more options for creative gameplay and design. Nowadays the bunny trivializes all map design.
---
Who considers the bunny as good gameplay? I don't have a problem with the others, they are pretty cool. Griffon has the same problem but at least it's a fun mount that takes some skill.
---
Not too sure on the funding, gliders are also very popular. (I still have default mount skins but several gliders)
---
PLEASE!
---
farm bot not making any gold atm?
---
&gt; Yeah it's maybe not the best fix, but it's what I came up with.
---
&gt; 
---
At some point I hope anet just has to admit that the concept is flawed, and an execution can never work. On the other hand I think they are too proud for that and will change random things (restrict SS from appearing in certain fractals, certain spots, change how fast the acceleration/deceleration is etc) in a 2-3 months interval without ever actually fixing the core problem.
---
That's how historically, they dealt with these problems: Very slowly, and not nuking obnoxious or overpowered shit from orbit but doctoring around (you say that in english? Well... )
---
Thank you for this reply, removing Arcdps fixed the freezes.
---
Hm... I was expecting to see something like these one day:
---
* A climbing or sticky mount that can walk on certain walls and ceilings. 
---
* A mount that dives underwater, or a new mastery for skimmers to do so. 
---
* A mount that carries other allies and is usable in WvW to carry players with no mounts. 
---
* A junundu wurm that can dig into wurm spurs to discover hidden underground areas. 
---
So if it isn't any of that... let's go crazy on this thing:
---
* A boat.
---
* A crystal elemental mount usable in combat. It is equipped in the elite skill slot instead the mount slot. Kind of like the asura golem powersuit elite, but last 60 seconds, mounts on skill use instead using the suit, shows your character and lasts 60s. 
---
* A harvesting mount with 3 arms (chainsaw, drill, pruning blade) that can gather nodes in an area instead one by one.
---
* A mount that can merge with others 4 mounts of the same type to form a 5-player massive voltron mount.
---
* A WvW [siege turtle mount](https://wiki.guildwars.com/images/5/53/%22Seige_Turtle%22_concept_art.jpg).
---
* A WvW [charr tank](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charr_Tank) mount.
---
* A WvW siege engine mount that can switch between mobile and siege modes. In mobile mode it works like a weaker version of a ballista, as mobile mode it works as a weaker version of a trebuchet with a shorter range. It takes 20 supply and 30s to switch modes, but it's extremely durable compared to other siege machines.
---
* [A mount that works like of the Slugs from metal slugs](http://metalslug.wikia.com/wiki/Slugs), but looks completely different. 
---
* An actual honest to the gods horse. Not a kirin or any other horse-like creature. A horse. 
---
This is actually a really great point. I personally never really thought about wanting your character to look like it wasn't wearing their weight in armor, and haven't really enjoyed outfits that much in general. But a firebrand wearing light armor is actually a really neat idea!
---
Except the game is bottlenecked and it doesn't help to have the most powerful supercomputer on the earth.
---
It's almost as if the wintersday raid was designed around a slippery floor, and anet didn't tell players to oil up and spread their assholes and just rammed it in, like with fractals.
---
counter argument, norn are just giant shapeshifting dwarves
---
Dwarves can't become the Bear, they only become the Great Dwarf.
---
Hot take: Norn are just maxi dwarves
---
Maybe its the dye job but I feel like this looks better on charr lmfao
---
Or dont delete that character and let it aquire bday rewards
---
'When some wild-eyed, eight-foot-tall maniac grabs your neck, taps the back of your favorite head up against the barroom wall, and he looks you crooked in the eye and he asks you if ya paid your dues, you just stare that big sucker right back in the eye, and you remember what ol' Jack Burton always says at a time like that: "Have ya paid your dues, Jack?" "Yessir, the check is in the mail." '
---
Big mustache on human pls
---
I wouldn't call them straight up buffs.
---
Most of them come with duration reductions.
---
More like more sharing of the boons you would normally apply to yourself so that people work better together.
---
That was a nice trait.
---
Welcome back to the game, glad to hear you two are enjoying it!
---
As far as guilds are concerned; keep in mind that while you can only represent one guild at a time, you can join up to 5 guilds and communicate freely between them without swapping your repped guild. This gets super useful as you start doing more things in the game; for example, joining a guild that only does WvW, a guild that does raiding, etc.
---
Hope you find a good fit!
---
Well, this is indeed apiece of art. I loved it as well, gotta agree this dude though, i was getting the goosebumps all the way down the trailer, but all a sudden it goes away. I still got impacted at the end but not because of the ending just because i knew what happened. But, ooooh boy, what a video you got here, it is beautiful, it is touching, it is involving, but the end is really an emotions killer. Im no expert, but you could continue the impacting sound, and as soon as the end is about to come, it can grow bigger and higher in the process, and then all of a sudden everything stops and the commander says his goodbyes.
---
Honestly, more emphasis on the second half than the first. I have leveled plenty of characters 1-80 the slow way and have no idea what 80% of my kit even does.
---
Eh personally I'd like to see these changes on warrior but also see banners normalized with spirits so that they are inter changeable (as stat buffs)
---
i really hope its the spider
---
The correct term is larvae.
---
Probably coming right in the middle of the season again. I honestly think they advertise seasons just to get a larger pool of people to "balance test" with.
---
This was the roller beetle. This already happened. Not sure why y'all are confused. Look at the article date.
---
Unless I've missed something definitive, it's unclear at the moment whether this was the last episode of the season or not -- Anet are being kind of cagey about it, not saying either way.
---
When the question was directly asked on the official forums, Mike Z, the game's director, [replied with a vague "Is it?"](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/793355#Comment_793355) You can take that pretty much any way you want, but it is pretty clear they want to be secretive about what comes next.
---
One more bit of information that I've seen about it comes from a former developer that worked on both season four and pre-production for season five, who made comments heavily implying that this episode ended the season.
---
I second this - we can already hide the head piece based on the visibility of that component, so if shoulders worked the exact same way that would be awesome. Thanks!
---
I'm not a pvper. How long was the break?
---
Where does it say that there will be no balance patch? Following their schedule there should in fact be some sort of patch next week, why assume it won't include balancing? 
---
What else is there to write though? 
---
made me lol
---
Raids are toxic content and are the reason why this game is dying.
---
peepoHappy
---
no....Noooo....NOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!  i swore i'd never see that nightmare ever again.
---
and yet i just looked up the youtube vid again.  i blame you.
---
Hi! Thank you so much for your comment, it really did mean a lot to me. And also thank you very much for the points you raised (I'm really taking them on board). I could never quite stick the ending (this went though about 6 different versions?), but I really like that idea. I'm going to do an overall trailer for fractals and season 4, so hopefully I'll be able to show my progress!
---
Just another toxic elitist trying to get anet to develop toxic and dead content. Smh
---
&gt; maybe a horse?
---
[No horses on Tyria](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Horse).
---
Saw that on youtube earlier. Great short video with good suggestions. Thanks for the content, Sir
---
Balance patch is coming, Ben said so on discord. No information about what and when though.
---
Yeah, every time I join a raid I just get flamed. It's kinda sad really, hope hey just remove raids, or at least focus on something valuable for the community. :/  
---
If the next place we go is Cantha I can see that making a lot of sense since the Thief is what the Assassin class from GW1 turned into and Shiro used those dual "daggers" (c'mon man, those things were 3 feet long.  How could they call them daggers lol) although, I'm pretty sure Rev has already got that spec.  
---
The door is too thin for a griffon. But you can kind of glitch in there by dismounting if you have gliding.
---
new balance patch could still be next week. Last season also saw a big update to class balance right at the start (rune and sigil rework) and also a mid-season balance patch with wintersday.
---
without spoiling too much, I'll just say that the choice you make in HoT does not affect the story of PoF, only the HoT story. 
---
The fact that it’s slower over land makes zero sense at all. Its like a helicopter should go slower while flying over water. Like really Anet?
---
You can play to story in any order you like. what you heard is regarding using the boost to get a mount from the first PoF story quest. If you use the level 80 boost for that, you cannot get it back. 
---
Does [this not look like a perfect horse](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Lunar_%22Horse%22) to you?
---
But instead of working together actively to get and share boons, many of your suggestions are passive sharing things (use any skill, everyone gets a thing, instead of pick skill specifically because it shares.)
---
I'm not opposed to having traits that focus on sharing boons (e.g. the target increase one on Herald) but these seem kind of all over.
---
If a boon get splashed out to 5 people, to retain the same effectiveness their duration would have to be 20% of current... At which point most of them wouldn't be worth it. (E.g. A skill gives 5 seconds of fury would give only 1. Meaning everyone would have to splash out 1 second to 5 people instead of 5 seconds to self, this would mean that access to boons when playing alone would be way lower.
---
I don't want to bash your entire idea, I just feel like there's some balance issues, with the focus being entirely in favour of group play, leaving solo play at a disadvantage. This is again where traits can shine, as switching those depending on what you're doing is a lot less hassle than changing your gear around to get more or less boon duration.
---
This is so central to the Norn as a race, and it breaks my heart at how little representation the Norn get anymore that people don't even know they're shapeshifters!
---
Wyvern mount /thnks anet
---
Probably because there's a thread for questions.
---
how do you even measure your DPS? I've been wanting to know my damage output
---
I don't know.  You have this special bond with Aurene.  Riding her into battle seems fitting.  I agree dye on aurene would be stupid.  Also every mount mastery we got this season is due to our relationship with Aurene.  We shall see.    
---
That would be &lt;110.
---
I experience that first issue occasionally: frame rate will drop dramatically and I have to force another application into focus then bring GW2 back into focus, at which point the FPS will shoot back up to normal levels.
---
Are you using an Nvidia GPU? My thought has always been that this is a graphics driver issue, since the first time it happened came right after an Nvidia driver update, and subsequent updates over time seem to have lowered the frequency of it happening.
---
Omg another mount? I'm running out of keybinds!
---
Go to the Special Forces Training Area in the aerodrome. It shows your DPS at different times while attacking the golem
---
Since every mount fills a niché 
---
A Multicarry Mount like a Dolyak isn't so off.
---
Also a mount that can do a 180° turn while at high velocity like the Snake wouldn't be too far fetched.
---
Underwater mount? On one hand, we'r missing some kind of fast underwater traversal AND we already have various means of traveling on land, in the air (gliding, griffon, new mastery), and in-between (like Jackal to teleport, raptor etc). On the other hand, we don't have THAT big of a need for underwater traversal **unless** next living story/expansion goes with a lot of underwater maps (but I don't think combat system is and ever will be ready for it, even with that rework we had).
---
Heh, that's a funny assumption you're making with Jormag there. Not fighting Jormag kind of means also not fighting Primordus, which means GW2's Elder Dragon arc is done very, very soon. Only Kralk and Bubbles left, and then Jormag and Primordus are free to wake and roam whenever, because the Commander is like, screw it, my story is done. Why is it that you believe this? 
---
Download arcdps.
---
They should delete poison because it's toxic.
---
Im never gonna get used to the "smh" thing. I always read it as "suck my head" :(
---
(I think he meant boons)
---
But lets be real here, if someone did put boobs on him, his effective DPS would sky rocket. 
---
Everyone in this thread thinks raids are toxic because of the elitism. Gear up one of your characters for dps (Dragon hunter, holosmith, deadeye, daredevil, weaver, southeast are all popular), join a discord like raiders in training (NA) or raiders inn (EU) then join a training group to dip your toes in the water. The environment where people expect wipes really helps motivate you to learn mechanics and get into it. 
---
I'm guessing he means chairs with two seats. But that means nothing - those 2 sits on a bench may be a separate entities.
---
* Story mode that can be done with 5 players, minimal rewards.
---
* Normal mode, just as usual.
---
* CM for each boss encounter, but repeatable not each week, but only when the raid has the Call of the Mists bonus.
---
Boom, there you have it. Entry point, high skill content, not forcing everyone every week to do only CMs, but also giving reasons to repeat CMs.
---
I have no idea what to expect.  A climbing mount would basically make the Springer useless because climbing to high places would be easier than trying to jump and land on a tiny bit of terrain to get higher.  Raptor, Jackal, and Beetle have land mounts pretty much covered.  Skimmer could use some expansion, but if there is an underwater mount then the skimmers only use would be for going over shallow water which is super niche...  Griffon covers a flying mount.  I'm stumped.
---
Not even Eir did it...
---
Female norn do not have beards.
---
We need to verify the boobs duration and sharing first.
---
I'm starting to reach the point where it's becoming sad that absolutely nothing can be unique in this game especially for NPC's. On one hand it's good to have cool skins available but on the other hand it's becoming sad to me.
---
DLGamer still has them on sale, although not quite as cheap: https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911
---
I agree with that question. \^\^ So far I dont see anything relateable in the game to be sure to say its possible to do anything dual like that.   
---
Also, I wonder if they would really do that, in general for open world. Theres two options if so.   
---
1) Its for non PoF users to tag them along, but then again I dont think they would do that because people might not buy the PoF AddOn then, since they can be tagged along.  
---
2) If it's just for PoF users, why would you tag along with someone else if its not just for fun or if someone wants to show you something, if you have a mount yourself.
---
Is it tho? We only have a handful of maps with big underwater bodies. Unless it's some kind of hybrid earth-water mount and/or next chapter/xpac will have a lot of underwater content (but I don't think combat is and will ever be ready for it).
---
Why not a bicycle built for two?
---
Like I said above Dlgamer doesnt work in my country. 
---
They don’t call W3 first boss Escort for no reason you know ;\^)
---
A WvW personnel carrier would be cool.  Everyone hop in the big metal spider and lets gooooo!
---
I really hope that’s not it =\ I want mounts to be able to seat multiple as well 
---
Other than underwater, I'm struggling to see what they could do. We have a high speed land racer, a medium speed land racer, a high maneuverability medium speed land racer, a high speed maneuverable flying mount, a surface liquid skimmer, and an all terrain jump bot.
---
Wait. I've got it! 
---
Even faster than the beetle, but it literally doesn't turn. 
---
Thank you!
---
just dont treat it like a hardcore game and dont always aim for fast and efficient. 
---
you can play gw2 one week and forget about it the next. its very forgiving in that regard.
---
I'm actually been looking out for a set of armour for my human Weaver for a while. It's true that it can't be customizable outside dyes, and that this outfit is pretty expensive right now. But at least I know that I have a pretty fashionable option that doesnt require me to get the full [Radiant Armor.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Radiant_armor_(light))
---
Raids such as frosty could always be an option for an easier mode, but I agree that the rewards should be minimal and should still strongly encourage players to do regular raids
---
Because different armor weights have different shapes. A medium armor chest piece always has a trenchcoat attached to it (though it might be invisible). If you want a trenchcoat on your warrior though, your only option is an outfit, because a heavy armor chest piece just doesn't reach that far down your character.
---
The suggestion of reusing forgotten assets and not having the most brilliantly designed boss is cool but something anet just seems to go against it as a principle. Even if they were tasked to do something like that they'd probably start making changes here and there and make it a big project during development.
---
I dont think its that hard to balance the rewards and getting rewards multiple times. It could be like normal mode 1 token, hardmode 3 tokens + chance at something rare and challengemode 5 tokens + even higher chance at something rare. 
---
They also dont really have to design everything new, just tweak a few numbers here and there and remove some hard mechanics for the easier modes.
---
I have this picture saved https://imgur.com/a/owtwAmP
---
Aurene mount
---
I think thats a valid point and I personally enjoy raids as they are, but I also think thats what teapot is trying to get at too.
---
Having bosses designed as-is currently right? but also having opt-in items that would reduce the difficulty on the whole.
---
And that wouldn't mean every boss from here on out is one-off like freezy was either, but not every raid release has be to full wing either.
---
I don't know if it would be the perfect solution, but I'm not sure if trudging forward acting like nothing is wrong is the best idea either. Something's gotta change eventually.
---
I've got a feeling this is "history repeats itself". Edge of Destiny attempted to kill Kralkatorrik before and Glint died as a result which caused them to disband. Maybe a similar thing will happen or this guild, Dragon's Watch, will actually succeed despite all odds.
---
It's something I'm wondering about too.
---
nothing, thats kinda the point ^^
---
Its gonna be a dragon mount and its for multiple people.
---
I would absolutely love a story mode! 
---
Nobody really asked for mounts to begin with in GW2, yet they are one of the best additions to the game.
---
I would love getting raids more often , without any major story or even unique rewards , and if they really want to give raids with story you can get those like we get the LS episodes.
---
Using current enemy models without any unique rewards should allow the raid team to focus on delivering great gameplay. 
---
They can even take this a step further and making rare open world drops as a drop from the raid version of the open world boss. For example you could have a chak gerent boss with a chance to drop the famous chak egg sac , you can have pinata raid boss with a chance for the confetti etc etc 
---
I'd rather have them stop making Outfits and finally putting some effort into new general armor skins that you can choose whatever you want. 
---
No that’s different if someone leaves after a boss kill then it’s not as bad as leaving the first boss attempt if the boss gets downed and you don’t feel comfortable staying for the next the. If you leave it’s not that big a deal. Clearing trash while filling a spot isn’t as bad as having to sit and wait with everyone’s food ticking down
---
PleasepleasepleasepleasePLEASE!
---
I have a few character level boosts that I want to use, namely some level 60 instant ones. Does the character got level 60 gear like I do when using a level 80 boost? 
---
I don't think it's a rumor. One of the devs talked about it.
---
&gt; Dolyak mount: can carry two or more players at once;
---
&gt; WvW mount;
---
Why not both?
---
WvW needs a dolyak mount!
---
Diviner's *technically* came out in S3, I believe, it just wasn't available in PvE. 
---
Silk worm might be pretty cute. Moves fairly slow, think Springer speed (which is still faster than a player) but can move vertically up walls without having to jump, stick to walls, or shoot a thread and pull itself to walls
---
guud**
---
Hmm, okay thank you. I remember a lot of people on tarnished coast were mad because it busted up the rp community or something
---
Holy Shit , I remember Minesweeper from before they even had phone games. Or cellular phones at all , for that matter. Crazy. Thanks !
---
I've had my fair share of toxic players, I'm just thankful to see a game where almost every group related event isn't filled with people arguing or people yelling at each other to kill themselves. Even around the world in WoW trying to talk to random players is like getting blood out of a stone as they'll just flat out ignore you. 
---
&gt; I ended up scrapping the engineer
---
I see what you did there.
---
I was attempting to tie back what we go through for 'ascencion' with what Aurene goes through in the episode. I get that for he story line itself it may be left out, but it's still a fun corollary to make in my mind.
---
Though the Mists could feasibly have anything occur in them (which is where PVP happens, no?) - I mean, some Commandos came out of a rift last episode, didn't they?
---
So - dungeons with CM? Wonder how such a thing would end...
---
Plz give us the penguin mount, ty. 
---
You can try to ask the support. Normally they won't do it, but if the account is new and your friend explains the mistake, they might change the server. (And if it's a paid account deleting all characters would allow to transfer for free. Upgrading a f2p account also gives 1 free transfer)
---
I have to say, the AoEs and flat out damage is one of the things that draws me to Ele.....but I also think I will enjoy being able to get in my enemy's face and stay there without being evaporated.
---
They both seem to be similar in certain ways but yeah, everyone is suggesting rev and I will take the advice.
---
i like the changes to **social awkwardness**
---
it's just less punishing to group who doesn't know how to deal with the old SA. the aoe is not over the top, so it's manageable when paired with other instabilities that you need to stay close. 
---
i also love **stick together**
---
it teaches people who are pew pew from miles away to learn to stay close to teammates for boon share and stuff. good practice for new players who want to learn a proper way to do group contents. 
---
speaking of the devil, **boon overload** is a bit too much. it deals an insane damage in higher tiers.  where there are a lot of mobs and you have a good boonshare bottie in the group,  without at least 80% protection uptime, it could easily wipe the whole group. they need to reduce the damage percentage down. 
---
outflanked 
---
i swear there was a time i got outflanked cuz i ate cc before that and got knocked to the side. and i literally got instantly down and my down health went to zero in 2s. i'm just like wtf. lol. i was really "outflanked". 
---
birds
---
i don't understand how people have problems with this instability at all? you literally have to waste a dodge when you get those birdies and that's it. 
---
we bleed fire
---
this can be dealt with projectile reflect/block. and cuz every time the aoe is going off in a different direction, i just dodge if my projectile block/reflect on cd. they need to tweak this instability or reduce the burning stacks cuz pugs down to this instability a lot. 
---
last laugh &amp; flux bomb
---
the stun from last laugh is very irrelevant, imo. nobody gonna waste a cc skill like that, let alone fighting a group of 6 enemies.  
---
as for flux bomb, you can't even drop it on enemies cuz if you have any melee players, they'll be blinded anyways and can't deal damage. 
---
me doing my first **slippery slope** 
---
it was rough on the first day but they had it on 100 3 days in a row, so i got so used to it. it makes me learn so much about control, movement as well as positioning like never before. 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/362163377
---
however, i believe they need to redo the slippery part to tone down the motion sickness for other players. i had a little motion sickness after that run for the rest of my t4s. i'd still feel like i was slipping and had a slight dizziness. but that was it. 
---
The Griffon can maintain and gain altitude.
---
It takes some skill, same as the roller beetle. But if you're able to master the Griffon, it's insanely mobile.
---
For practice:
---
1. The city in the sky in desert highlands at night. Go to the mastery point, and fly among the buildings to use them like a measuring stick and learn how to gain height. You absolutely can get higher and higher with Griffon if you do it well. You just need a base amount of drop to gain initial speed.
---
2. Do the Griffon master and Griffon expert courses. Get gold on all of them and you'll see what a wonderful beast the Griffon is. 
---
The clipping they let into the game is likely nothing compared to what is filtered out in testing. Every piece needs to be tested with the seams of the other pieces. The fact is outfits are easier for them to implement than armor in the existing system, so that's what we get. Maybe they could make fewer armor sets in place of the outfits, but that would mean fewer gem sales, which is also unfair to ask of the company that makes the vast majority of their money from gems
---
Problem is GW2 seriously lacks team content. Two fractals a year are not going to keep a guild or a group of friends busy. There have been (and still are) many complaints about lacking group- and guildcontent. Even by open world communities (not enough "organised content").
---
I'm perfectly fine with difficult raids. But then Anet really needs to increase the amount of content they are releasing. 5-10 dungeons each year would be good.
---
Otherwise Anet gets a super casual group of players which log in once a month a does one open world boss as fireele before logging off again - and a very hardcore group of players doing raids. And nothing in between. That's not a healthy population. Coregamers, "family and friends" guilds etc. are a big and very relevant group in MMOs. Hardcoreplayers only: see wildstar.
---
Oh geez. That is probably why it is taking a while to fix.
---
new maps,new rewards,new systems,new ballance patch,new game modes......
---
Watched 2 minutes. 
---
Watched you engage a soulbeast. The soulbeast just literally outran you to get OOC and reset. 
---
Watched the soulbeast turn around and pewpew you. Watched you run off and port straight to keep as soon as you got OOC.
---
At that point i figured I saw enough roaming for one day. 
---
When the servers were separate, there were divisions like that. Tarnished coast was an unofficial RP server, and RPers congregated there. It wasn't uncommon to see them at it when running through town or even out hunting.
---
Megaservers toss everyone together, and affected how that is all coordinated.
---
I'm glad I funneled most of my gold into gems the first year and put a bunch of upgrades on my account. I didn't need to buy anything until the expansions
---
Since he said it’s a mount we won’t expect, I’m voting for a Kralk mount. 
---
And not miniature Kralk either. 
---
We’re all gonna fly around on full sized Kralk and watch the servers implode. 
---
just checked the dates myself, 2-3 months checks out for all of season 3, but almost every release for season 4 has had a larger than 3 month gap in between them. For the most part though, it is close to 3 months, so how about I just change it to 3 months and we'll call it good
---
What if they made an insect like but not straight up sider sorta creature like the chak?
---
Or stop making outfits and start making armor sets, maybe do some sort of retroactive outfit to armor set conversion, perhaps with a large discount on the sets you already have as outfits or something.
---
This is from September 11, 2018. We got the Beetle mount on June, 2018. 
---
Yeah but you just have to ride the wave. Each ascension can get you higher than your previous one.
---
It's a skill. If you dive for too long you won't gain the height back. If you dive for too short you don't get enough momentum to fully climb. But if you do a short down dive into a flap/swoop then immediately pull up as hard as you can, using the ascend skill and not the drag/slow key (S, which also ascends but less effectively) then you can gain height above your starting point.
---
Trust me on this. I used to dick around in Istan waiting for Pala metas and would climb pretty much out of the map. Eventually there's a kind of air cap where it gets very hard to keep gaining height, I'm not sure what that's about. But you're above the clouds before you reach it. 
---
I tend to play by myself or with one other person.  If we could both be on the same mount, there's no chance of losing track of each other (you would think the mini map icons would resolve that, but apparently not).
---
Finally, someone said what has been on my mind for years... Decades... 
---
You'll have much more luck doing this in game. 
---
Yeah, the easy mode just getting 5-10 shards per kill per week would be plenty, and make it possible for them to outright purchase ascended gear within a week or two of grinding.
---
The instances would still be for 10 players, but story mode would be less strict, enough for 5 players to do it, so they can start with less than 10 if the LFG is going slow, or do it with 5, or even solo, if they want the 'challenge'. 
---
As for dungeons, since they show the story of Destiny's Edge and I'm seeing tons of people getting to Victory of Death after forgetting about them, I think they should do with dungeon story modes what they did with Arah story, and turn them into actual story chapters., scaled for 1-5 players.
---
Unlike raid and fractal stories, the dungeon stories are an actual part of the Commander's timeline. Players get a mail from their friend from destiny's edge at the time that matches each dungeon story. Those would be the best points to insert the dungeon stories.
---
So balance patch next week. Cool, cool.
---
Think I need some help, either with HoT zones or class choice.
---
It's like I've stepped into a new, incredibly brutal world after leveling to 80. A lot of normal mobs are now incredibly dangerous, I can't even finish an overload lightning before a pack of pocket raptors has killed me, and even bronze mobs seem to have CC lockdown attacks they spam until I'm (quickly) dead. I've been running around trying to unlock more of Tempest in mostly green berserker gear. Obviously I have no waypoints and don't know my way around, which doesn't help either.
---
Basically, I'm really not enjoying playing the game like this. Should I just ditch HoT and try out PoF instead? I've read that it's supposedly more solo-friendly? Or are there any other classes that are (a LOT) more sturdy that could still heal in group content? I generally don't have anyone to play with, and I don't really want to feel shackled to a group when I'm just running around an area. That wasn't a problem at all while leveling up, nor at 80 in old zones. I do also have a Revenant at 80 that I abandoned to level the Elementalist. Would that fare better?
---
Glad you found a class that clicks with you! Reaper was my main for the longest time (my Reddit name is the name of my little Asura reaper lol)
---
Definitely a fun spec. I fell in love with the minion-master style, and just plowing through any group of enemies I could find. 
---
General
---
Why do I actually need to play something to tell how something will be played when there is a plethora of videos on youtube on just about how every single mmo that has come out?
---
I wouldn't be surprised at all if certain aspects of GW1 'feels harder' to play because of its clunky combat system compared to GW2. GW2 may feel easier to play than other games precisely because the combat system allows players to control their characters alot better than other games. As a result similar encounter mechanics from other games in gw2 can be handled much better. This is not  because gw2 is easy  it is because gw2 allow for higher tier of play.
---
Disabling vsync just to better make use of certain skills in builds sounds like a problem with gw1 graphics engine design itself. I also have had ingame international players tell me that they've never felt lag in gw2 but back in the gw1 days they would rubber band all over the place with the same ping. In my experience gw2 is good up to around 300ms ping which just about covers the entire world.
---
Soul calibur and tekken actually fall under the clumsy combat category. Pulling off combos in these games feels more impressive than in street fighter and marvel vs capcom series precisely because their combat system is less flexible. This does not mean they are harder to play it means they don't allow players to play to their full potential. Same argument with GW2 vs alot of other mmos dumbed down clunky combat systems.
---
I've been a WoW player for about 6 years and have been on and off with GW2 for about the same.  One suggestion I have is to get really familiar with the achievements panel.  Those achievements include collections you can put together for reward items and titles and you can track them by clicking the eye-con beside the achievement.  As a WoW player, it took a while for the game to really click for me, especially with regards to rewards which at first seemed lackluster.
---
Also, go ahead and fill your character slots early so they will accumulate birthday rewards.
---
Lastly, the Arenanet team does Youtube streaming events that are worth checking out.
---
What's that website that can beak down for me legendary/pre crafting step by step?
---
Probably not, for the same reason the mechanic itself hasn't shown up in any other maps, given that other less game breaking mechanics have shown up in places they don't thematically make sense.
---
I don't have a URL easily available, but it has to do with the tech that is currently used for chairs. Broadly speaking, during their first pass for building mounts, they created a system that allowed them to essentially stick one entity (such as a player) onto another entity (such as a raptor), and merge control of the two together. They eventually decided to make Mounts simple transformations for performance reasons, but the code is still present and fully functional, and there's nothing stopping them from using it to stick one player to another. This was all explained in a stream around the time PoF came out.
---
A Charr tank that has a powerful aoe attack or dredge vehicle that burrows underground (or both). So far everything has been living. Something none living would be a huge difference. We lack something that can burrow; possible way to avoid enemies and launch a sneak attack. Could be slow but an effective way to get around without causing a scene.
---
they had an excellent spider mount prototype but they didn't release because it was too creepy and just made people uncomfortable
---
The box releases are cheap as hell, they exist to spark interest in the game so people will buy gems. Don't get me wrong, I'd really like armor sets, I find outfits kinda cheap. But people clearly buy them, and it works for their allocation of resources, so it is unlikely to ever change
---
Yes we need more lag in WvW
---
The wiki can do it but gw2efficency is the best one. I think you may need an account, though.
---
This is how Yogg-Saron (the final boss of Ulduar in WoW) was designed. I doubt you can find very many people who raided Ulduar and don't think it's basically the greatest raid of all time, so any time a dev takes design cues from it is encouraging.
---
You're presenting a very simple, basic and common theory with a lot of unnecessary bloat. This is exactly what almost everyone is thinking.
---
The addition of the backpiece stuff is also redundant at best. The piece is already years old and the names of its ingredients are just very, very general symbols and themes. 
---
If it's a bug, they will fix it. Not sure why they would get a refund?
---
I wonder if people will get that reference.
---
i feel like your name is very fitting of this
---
Go Rev, I just boosted one and love him. Idk all the people saying they are bad, I feel powerful and never die. Have not done pvp yet though.
---
The jackal is thinner and I slid down the first time I try to got in. It was well over the edge of the entrance.
---
Episode 3 was released in June. This article is from September 11, 2018. 
---
I'll check it out, thank you.
---
raptor long jump + new mastery should get you there
---
I think a big part of that is that, outside of some very particular things (some of which, confusingly, are all in the latest map), the game tries to make it so that no one person's experience can detract from someone else's.
---
Gathering resources is not limited to one node per person. Priority for exp isn't given to any one player (no KS, no pulling every mob to target aggro). Events are open to whoever is in the area, and not just to whoever starts it. Loot is calculated by player, not by enemies, so one person getting an item does not change the chances of someone else getting an item. 
---
I am fine if they make something that allows the boss difficulty to drop.  I don't want them wasting dev time making easier versions of bosses with reduced mechanics though.  If you activate an "easy mote" that reduces boss health by 30% and damage by 30% or w.e, that's fine and doesn't really add much dev time.  I also think, this easier mode should give next to no rewards to encourage people to use it as a stepping stone instead of just being complacent.  This also allows ppl to do raids for the story if they want.
---
or use the new mastery.
---
I prefer to call them details, sources, and attempts to show the audience how I came to the conclusion; I can see how you'd feel that way though. 
---
There have been long-term story callbacks in the past (particularly dealing with Ascension and the Mists) - I wouldn't put it out of mind just because it's old. It's possible this was planned out when they released the backpack.
---
I main mesmer, if you really want mobility, go for the mirage specialization. The elite skill is a condi close range teleport, several of the skills involve swapping places with clones, actually teleporting, and (in the case of PvP and WvW) jumping around confusing your enemy a ton.
---
Chrono hits a bit harder, and still has some movement, but you're better off playing mirage if you want a strong, movement heavy toon.
---
Yes almost got my pvp wings only needs to do the 3x pvp ranked games per day, only 8 days left!
---
Then those wings will be mine!!!!!
---
Elephant 
---
I asked for mounts but that's cuz I really just wanted a horse :C
---
Sugar Rush:
---
My team had this instability on the grawl fractal with the Grawl harpy kinda god
---
It somehow influenced the spawn rate of that fractal. at the start of the fractal, normally a ton of grawl appear but somehow they all spawned like a army of lemmings! 
---
Newish player, bought the game a long time ago but didn't really play until now and just got my ranger to 80 and had a few questions. 
---
* Where should I be focusing my time on with regards to masteries? Should I be trying to finish the central tyria ones before HoT or PoF? 
---
* How do dungeons and raids work in general? I know this is vague but I've really only leveled to 80 and completed the personal story so far. 
---
* I just unlocked the glider in the first HoT zone, how do you get different skins for them? I only saw a few on the gem store and was a little confused.
---
What about legendary armor? If it takes twice as long with 5 players, or even 10 times longer, that’s fine with me. But please for the love of god let us obtain legendary armor (with actual unique skins) without having to deal with all of the crap raids brings up
---
The Ascension's wings share the same design as the centre of the egg chamber in Tarir, but I think that's all there is to it.
---
How did we miss this??
---
Imo, HoT introduced stuff, that were but got refined in PoF to the better,  along with its own qualities.
---
I like both with a tendency to PoF for the location (the ascencion was my favorite story chapter in gw1.
---
They even showed off early concept art. I think one was kinda like a giant rhino. A multi-player mount was one of the first variations they looked into.
---
Episode. Not PvP. :)
---
That spider was terrifying, however I'd gladly be scared until the "OMG AWESOME" feeling started from being able to websling everywhere. 
---
Thanks for the answers. :)
---
Next sale will be with 90% march. But watch out march sales are only one day
---
Dragon! Underwater is probably not until ocean expansion 
---
A sub-aurene if you will
---
I'm going to take your word for this but I don't feel that it really satisfies what I'm looking for.  If I have to seek out a point on the map with enough height for a full dive and enough room to pull up it isn't exactly practical.  I'm looking for flapping wings in place makes one go up and flaps are enough to keep one up indefinitely.
---
I do appreciate you describing your method though since it is likely we'll never see what i described above.  I'm still astonished by the negative and visceral reaction other people here have when people suggest that real flying might be fun to have.  It's like we suggested that the mount look like their mom.  (Who is also fun to ride) ;P 
---
Many assume that they are extinct. There was at least one undead enemy in GW1 that rode a zombie horse, so we know they exist...posthumously.
---
Well, there's WvW and PvP legendary armor. And I think there should add another one for core PvE made by upgrading crafted armor, but for the legendary skins they probably can't change how they are now. It'd be a tad too unfair for those who already did it. 
---
Even better, there should be a method to swap stats and upgrades that does not involve getting legendary armor at all. A template system that includes also a way to unlock stats and upgrades to switch between them later, for a reasonable material or currency coat if your gear isn't legendary.
---
I am curious already if they stick to such a tight plan or if they make a whole new season that it might take a little more time instead of just a episode. Thank you for the quick answer. :)
---
The one with the wheels!
---
yassss
---
I already had the new mastery. But I tried to sneak into every one of those spots without it just to test. Many let you stand on the edge with the mount and dismount.
---
Yes, thats why I had to think about it. A Rhino or something like that would ideal to have the dual concept on a mount. :)
---
It's just a white mantle jade construct from the siege in GW1
---
That's just speculation however. 
---
With the caveat that I know that this would be an ABSURD amount of work, what about a mount that brings you to the mists as like an "other side" type place where terrain is the same but monsters from Tyria can't see / attack you and vice versa. Maybe this just let's you move past things without being seen but it would be awesome if they made the "other side" it's own playable map with cool things and mist monsters and using the mount brings you back and forth. But yeah, creating an alternative map for each map in the game would be a huge undertaking and will almost definitely not happen.
---
Still, I like the idea of a mist mount, especially considering recent events. Maybe it just makes you invisible and incorporeal while active? Useful for sneaking by mobs?
---
The balance patch last season was in the middle of the season, so don't get your hopes up
---
new map has rocks &gt; cantha has rocks &gt; cantha confirmed
---
I do believe that people refer to that as "vore". No Im not googling that to confirm it.
---
No there are 3 teams who work on living world and a much bigger team who works on expansions I actually think they are working on re-implementing living world season 1 then go back to working on the expansion sorry tangent. As I was saying there are 3 teams and a dev answered this question last week on a livestream so episode 6 should be in the end stages not ready for release but in the end stages whatever that means, episode 1 of season 5 should be in the middle stages and episode 2 of season 5 is in the early stages. I believe this is how a dev described it on the livestream but maybe they could correct me if I'm wrong.
---
and I get that, and if I offended you with what I said, sorry. But purely by the numbers, we've had one season which fit their 2-3 month schedule, and one season, technically, has not. I never said that I doubt their intentions to release within 2-3 months, it's just an expectation that it will take closer to the 3 month side of things than the 2 months side.
---
Even removing the latest episode as an outlier due to the holiday season, the average times between episodes were
---
Season | Average (days)
---
------|-------
---
3 | 72.8
---
4 | 87.33
---
Total | 78.25
---
So I believe that saying that the release window is about 3 months, and effectively ignoring the 2 months portion of that segment, is a better estimate, especially since we don't know what kind of delays might end up occurring (fingers crossed that none happen)
---
And realistically, at this point, aren't we just arguing over pedantry? Let's just say that we expect the next release around the beginning of April
---
Awakened dual-mount Aurene
---
Wow, well after reading through  some more of the subreddit I can see why you might have been frustrated by this post. I finally had time to play the episode today, so I was avoiding the subreddit this past week and was excited to share what I thought was going on - but I see I'm not the first. And that WP has ALREADY  made a video about it, which I'm goign to have to watch tomorrow. 
---
Did you play the game ?

---
I was thinking something like a slow moving tank just gets you through enemy territory but slow.. sort of same idea 
---
1. Go to the bouncy pad at the entrance of Ebonhawk. 
---
2. Exit the top of the bounce via glide.
---
3. Mount your griffon.
---
4. Do a dive and then try to recover your height.
---
5. Notice that you can't.
---
That sound like a good idea. Maybe they haven't designed the part for underneath the shoulders for most outfits but could do that in the future. 
---
To people complaining about ditching outfits all together. I definitely understand that critique on some random outfits but I feel like a good number of outfits we recently got were having designs that wouldn't really translate into separate armor pieces. And in the case of, for example Logan's Armor, I don't think the designers wanted to limit their design by having to worry about clipping/problems with other armor pieces. 
---
(I know there is armor that clips anyway)
---
I personally would prefer if characters that are important enough to get a custom design are the only ones that look like this instead of selling it in the gemstore. 
---
All in all I understand that some outfits would be better as separate armor pieces, I just think the ones released recently aren't part of that. 
---
Disabling the shoulders would be nice, though. 
---
A flying unicorn that isn't as fast as the griffon but won't lose altitude!
---
Completing tribulation mode over and over and over and over and over and over
---
The tears are just because of how hard the jumping is.
---
Lord, that they are not confusing themselves lol. Thank you for this detailed information. :)
---
I expect Kralkatorrik to fall asleep like the other dragons and we'll dodge a bullet in the world ending. Meanwhile, the Inquest/Icebrood/Team Rocket will try to harness the crystalline power inside Aurene, and we'll have to play defensive until Taimi's on death's door, or Zojja's return, or some big cataclysm.
---
I'm all for some sort of Mists mount. When you mount up, you switch to a Mists overlay version of the map, becoming invisible to regular players, and interacting with new features. Dismounting immediately drops you back into the regular physical world again. The world-layers thing has worked well for games like Soul Reaver. Unfortunately, to be fully utilized it would require a lot of assets to be added to every map in the game. Then again...how often do we actually use the jackal's ability? Having less for it do would be underwhelming, but if those few options are good, then it could maybe still be worth it.
---
I want my own Scruffy!!!
---
Nobody would expect a Chocobo mount.
---
People have been thinking they have been hints too Cantha since season 2 and the Durmand Library. 
---
Remember when people avoided using waypoints because the accumulated cost actually had a noticeable effect on our wallets?
---
This is from 2018 so would this not be referencing the roller beetle? 
---
My mount idea is a bit NSFW :-D
---
At least more than 3.
---
The Dynamics Exo-Suit, the Raiment of the Lich and the Primeval Dervish are 3 outfits I'd use again if you could toggle the shoulders (or holograms for exo suit).
---
Well in that case you'll be nodding along to a lot of things WP has to say ;)
---
They...literally aren't designed that way. It's a single asset. There is no "shoulder" model to turn off.
---
I really hope it's the [Donkey-Lady from RDR](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q7v4F8r9Og).
---
Ascension was also a GW1 mechanic/lore bit that let you enter the realm of the gods, and therefore complete the Prophecies campaign.
---
I've never heard of the powers of the Mursaat being called "Ascension", though. The human gods had not yet even entered Tyria by the time they learned how to enter the mists.
---
I just wish I didn't have to recast ALL of my mantras EVERY TIME I zone into a new map. If they would just start off cast or at the very least remember their last state, I would be so happy.
---
You don't understand.
---
The people who say "toxic" are generally the ones who want to bring their Rifle Warrior with Pick 'n' Mix armour and 5 assorted runes to existing raid groups and aren't allowed.
---
Well, I would call it an assumption. Hence me using the word "assume."
---
Oh man... I wish a jade shard ='ed cantha confirmed 
---
PvP action and such are not cannon, but the maps in which they happen are.
---
In GW1, the Battle Isles are very much cannon. The main temple of Balthazar where the Zaishen had their base of operations and main temple. 
---
GW2's pvp maps are in the mists, and they are basically pocket fractals. So while what happens in them is not canon, the original story that inspired them is, like the Battle of Khylo. 
---
I would love invisible chest piece for my commander! Bare chest blinding enemies with the shine of his manliest Asura chest hair! 
---
It feels natural enough to me...
---
The Jade Sea melted again, so it's a regular sea again.
---
BUT IMAGINE A RAID WITH KANAXAI AT THE END.
---
Actually, they can; they just find it...
---
...unbearable.
---
Because it would be story breaking... people just look at Aurene and see a cute baby dragon pet. She's a freaking descendent of an elder dragon, she's part of a big and important prophecy. She's not a pet or a mount. How fucked up would be lore wise to just see everyone in the open world mountimg Aurene, flying here and there helping the commander farming mats for his next legendary or map exploration or chasing little events in random maps? Sounds ridiculous to me. I would love a dragon or wyvern skin for the griffon, sure, but not her...
---
Ancient Psychic Tandem War Elephant
---
Yeah. A terrestrial mount is just going to compete for space with an already crowded pool of mounts (raptor for burst speed on flat terrain, jackal for inclines, rollerbeetle for long distances) and the griffon would be hard to compete with without making something too powerful. The springer and skimmer are already super niche mounts.
---
The most logical mount the game needs at the moment is an underwater mount. Going underwater just feels bad after moving so quickly above land. Allowing it to be a terrestrial mount as well (like a giant otter) would give it some niches elsewhere.
---
Its obviously an aerial combat mount. It should have been expected with all the updates that have had elements relating to this.
---
Mace is great just remember that it doesn't have condi dmg, and the trait Reflect Missile works with Mace 2 skill Counter Blow, and not just Shield Stance. Also ballistics won't trigger the counter attack, but will instead reflect ballistics back at the target for the duration the skill is active.
---
havent played war as a main since wing 5 lmao, how am i up there????
---
I think it's in Dredgehaunt Cliffs. It's a quest where the skritt finds a suit of Dredge armor.
---
I wouldn't call it enough to rule out a horse mount or horses not existing at all. 
---
Especially since "recently as 1325 AE, Krytans used equines to pull carts and carriages in Queensdale."
---
&gt; when feared.
---
...or targeted by an ally with [Invisible Slippers].
---
Or a phase shift where we become a ghost to every other player and have a full screen visual effect and see a lot of *secrets* they don't.
---
That is not jade.
---
Jade shards are mostly green with blue highlights (purple with red highlights for mursaat jade).
---
That's mostly gray with a green glow. That's more like magically charged deldrimor steel, remants of a stone dwarf or something that got transformed by the Great Dwarf transformation like [Droknar's Weapons](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Gallery_of_Droknar%27s_weapons), or whatever Dhuum's throne is made out of. 
---
Well, I mean, it would fit if Mike Z is just \*\*that\*\* out of touch with the playerbase.
---
They should have some instability for healing instead of slippery slope. Something like, your healing damages enemies, but healing allies is 50% less effective. 
---
I really hate outflanked and slippery slope. Those two are my least favorite. Some of the instabilities when combined are utter nightmares where damage ramps up very quickly. I agree with analysis for the most part you have provided, and I think there is room for improvement. 
---
A chameleon ? XD 
---
While I'm hesitant to ask for it, a mount ability that is unused would be to copy what Mesmer portals do allowing you to help your fellow players. Though that wouldn't apply to some of the most important places to portal: JP's where mounts are disabled.
---
All about prestige and full legendary gearing 
---
Ben is the only one that likes pvp unfortunately. It's a pill that's gotta be swallowed.
---
It's the end of this season, and I honestly expect the next one to go sideways from here a bit. I am almost expecting something off the wall, like an invitation to finally meet E at a new (and somehow compromised) Consortium resort somewhere, because they figured we could use a bit of relaxation along with whatever news they have for us.
---
I mean, you just put armor on her. Now you have both a variety of skins, and some dye channels. 
---
I never saw it mentioned once! Still, surprised it didn’t get hyped like that anyway since new mount is big deal
---
"This need more discussion," lmao, This is the weekly raids are hard, people are toxic, we need ez mode thread. Go read previous threads, same shit in every one of them.
---
You people wanna ez mode raids? Okay then, the toxic raiders want a new raid every 3 months instead of some empty map with almost no content.
---
The ogres have been working on taming Chak for three years now, let's see some progress. 
---
Jackal can already do that, though. 
---
Warrior you will pretty much only be playing Bannerslave builds (Condition Berseker, Power Core, Boonstrip SB)
---
Elementalist, I haven't seen too much of recently, but I believe the main builds are Power Weaver, Heal Tempest, and Condition Tempest (?).  Core Ele is essentially dead because they nerfed core traits a while ago to tone down Weaver DPS.
---
Great video. I especially fully support reusing awesome old content/bosses/mechanics...........reusing lets say, frikken awesome maps made for, dungeons !?!? 
---
Like , rewards also not an issue, make same thing as u did for chak meta , infusion. Rare.
---
Anet, can u like, try to at least listen. 
---
Ekolo brought a junundu all the way to the Shiverpeaks, though she said they can't handle cold well. 
---
Obvious one is a dual seat doylak
---
It would be a doylak. Horses aren't in  the game.
---
Everyone seems convinced Aurene is coming back, and for mostly justifiable reasons... But am I the only one that would be super impressed with the balls on the narrative team if Aurene was actually dead for good? I'm not blind to the ways they could make her "death" meaningful while bringing her back later, but I'll be damned if it wouldn't be powerful to have direct confirmation in-game that she won't be coming back through any of the means we've theorized. We really would be lost, and finding a new way forward would push some really substantial development for the main characters.
---
That said, it would also be a really dark way to end a season. Probably not what they have planned, as much as I would love that.

Players of GW1 will probably remember normal and hard mode content. Once you beat the story, you would unlock the ability to enter maps and missions on hard mode, which would be more challenging and more rewarding than normal mode. I see no reason why dungeons and raids can't be given the same treatment. To have a normal mode (which would be harder than it is currently) would allow more people to participate in the content and get the story. Then the hard mode (or current difficulty) can be the way to get the cool rewards. Hell, they could even make it harder than it is currently for the hard mode to **really** appeal to the hardcore crowd. 
---
reward systems like this require 3 different things, skill, time and gold and Anet has to balance those 3. Skill-gates are in my opinion not very good for what is supposed to be the main casual content.
---
Gating behind gold costs (null sigils for the armor in last episode) also isnt everybody's cup of tea, just like timegates arent for some other people.
---
Personally, I also prefer gold-gates because I have a wealthy account and usually I am not the farmer type, so acquiring account bound mats and currencies isnt really my tea either. 
---
But I am fine with 2-3 week timegates for the biggest shinies/collections from each episode.
---
From an economic point of view, I would also prefer, if they would put the main material/gold sinks of each episode behind longer timegates because it keeps the market more balanced.
---
And in general I agree, the main map reward system of this episode through the meta-plates and serpentite jewels isnt my favourite from the season 4 maps either. 
---
It remains to be seen, if the plate halves from the meta will retain any kind of value after a couple of weeks or months and once you crafted all dragonblood weapons and got your diviner gear, there is no point in running the puzzles anymore on a daily basis for the serpentite, unless they release new sinks for it down the line.
---
And people is not unfomfortable with mummies?
---
“This season” instead of “later this season” and “a new mount” instead of “another new mount” kinda worries me.
---
It probably isn't a Dolyak then. Too bad.
---
Hey, I remember a looooooong time ago someone leaked that we'd be going to cantha in living world and that it would include a mount of a never before seen creature that was completely floaty but can't gain vertical height. I wonder if it's true?
---
Oh I never said we couldn't have some sort of horse. Only that they're dead. This is Tyria, after all.
---
The commander's friends include a golemancer, a biologist, a necromancer, and someone with access to the mists. We also have access to time bubbles now. There are options galore.
---
If they release world 3 this time, it'll be the truth
---
For raid builds: snowcrows.com
---
For fractal builds: discretize.eu
---
Both sites are in the process of updating following the most recent balance patch.
---
I see, thanks for the reply \^\^
---
- Do pact provisioner from core tyria asap so you can get aoe loot. Unlocking glider/mount is optional until you reach that content, but they help a lot in traveling.
---
- Dungeons are abandoned (by devs) 5 man content, mostly played by people who level up (can be quite hard) and people who farm them for achievements/gear/gold (can be quite easy with maxed builds). 
---
- Fractals are the end game 5 man content which work like a mini dungeons with scaling difficulty through 4 tiers and 100 levels (25 per tier, around 20 or so different fractals).
---
- Raids are 10 man "challenging" (really depends on your skill level and boss you fight; sometimes players can be bigger challenge than the content itself) content.  
---
You can find plenty of info about all of them on gw2 wiki.
---
- You can usually check acquisition methods in hero panel (H), or just search on wiki. Gem store content cycles constantly, so if it's only available there your only option is waiting.
---
yea its a bit confusing at times :P im mostly up to date with the vanilla story, but since living world started im a biiiiiiit lost
---
March 19.
---
It is just my personal tip, but you can count on it ;-)
---
* PvP season ends one day earlier, similar how the last season ended one day before patch
---
* it is 2,5 months since last LS patch (and everyone cannot wait *already* and christmas shifted last release a bit)
---
* it is nicely 2-3 weeks before SAB
---
* it is tuesday
---
I really think the only area that we haven't added a mount for is underwater and if they are keeping with the current utility idea, then that would make sense. It also isn't going to be any creature we can casually encounter on a map. Its going to be something new.
---
The roller beetle is, IMHO, an exception, as it really offered nothing new except wall breaks, and those only exist on maps that are designed with them in mind.
---
As for a longshot wish, I hoped they would add one legendary creature, **A HORSE** as a mount, because "HORSIE!!! &lt;3"
---
But there is another utility they could add with mounts and that is a combat based mount. There is also the possibility that a direct engagement skill could be added in the mount masteries as well. We have "Bond of Faith" now and that allows us to launch off our mount, but we could have another combat ability that allowed us to use both the launch AND use the engage skill.
---
Just sounds like it would be cool.
---
So they all mysteriously died the exact year GW2 starts?
---
Hello there, welcome to Tyria!
---
Regarding masteries:  
---
You don't really have any proper order as to what masteries to get, you just kinda get what you want.  
---
The only masteries that you need to get if you want to do HoT story are (in order) Gliding lvl1 (Glider Basics), Itzel Lore lvl1 (Bouncing Mushrooms), Exalted Lore lvl1 (Exalted Markings),  Gliding lvl2 (Updraft Use) and Nunoch Lore lvl1 (Nunoch Hunting). I'm not sure about PoF since I don't have it myself yet but I think you should follow [this guide](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/4111/mount-training-crash-course-spoilers) and you'll be good to go!  
---
Regarding dungeons and raids:  
---
They are your typical instances where you fight mobs and get loot from it (although gw2 raids tend to swing more in favour of mechanics and tactics rather than just pure DPS.  
---
However, dungeons are significantly more easier than raids so it might be better to do dungeons for a bit until you get comfortable with your class. Another great option are Fractals of The Mists (FoTM) which are sort of like mini-dungeons but with more loot imo. I think this is the best place to start if you're looking to do raids eventually down the line.  
---
If you need any help with getting started refer to the following guides: [FoTM](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16bt-vFeeLAeEsaoz72bkc4ZODsudIQ2hiQdvSnFYLtw/edit) [Dungeons](http://gw2dungeons.net/) [Raids](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Yshyii/A_Practical_Guide_To_Raids) [Raids Alternative](http://dulfy.net/category/gw2/raid-guides/)  
---
Keep in mind that you don't really need a build or a guide for a dungeon since they're fairly simple to pick up, but it's nice if you take the time to learn them if you plan on playing them for a while.  
---
Regarding the glider skins:  
---
Yes, you can get glider skins in the gem store, but **only in the gem store**, so if you want to look good and join Fashion Wars 2, you gotta get that $$.  
---
Hope this helped you,  
---
Good luck and don't forget to have fun!
---
Ah, I see, hopefully it gets fixed soon. Gonna give it another shot today, hoping that I grab it.
---
Oh cool, I wasn't aware of that. Thanks a lot!
---
&gt; by the time they learned how to enter the mists- if that's even what they do.
---
It seems to be. Spectral Agony is a skill partly given to us in LS3, but only works when we got "one foot in the mists" (near death), whereas the Mursaat were explained as able to slip in and out of the mists at will.
---
How is this a trailer!? It tells the entire story.
---
BDO is stealthily very poular. On steam alone for instance it regularly has more players than ESO and FFXIV.
---
https://store.steampowered.com/stats/Steam-Game-and-Player-Statistics?l=english
---
I haven't played Runescape, but since the mobile release it is doing very well, and seems to be one of the most played MMORPG's at the moment.
---
To be fair, that one would work better as a roller beetle skin.
---
I'll at least concede that point, then.
---
The beetle was released with Episode 3, which was late June. Also, he mentioned Sun’s Refuge as an upcoming instance so either he’s incredibly out of touch with the game’s development or there could be another mount coming soon.
---
Thanks, I'll look to swap maps if this issue reoccurs. I wasn't aware I could be ported over, I'll probably end up doing that as a last resort. 
---
Maybe would fit with the New Years event too. :)
---
Mounted combat mount would be great. A warquaggan.
---
Isn't that just crazy luck? I don't consider myself "lucky" when it comes to these things so I just stick to math and statistics 
---
Ulduar was definitely one of the best made raids ever in any game.  It's my number 1 after all these years. WoW raids are so different than gw2 raids tho. WoW raids are on a much epic scale.
---
Gosh, is that really June already with the beetle ? Thought it was later. :D 
---
Yup, At one point over the span of 5 kills, I constantly spam interacted all over the room in hopes of getting the plate. 
---
I have not done that room before, I did interact the sarcophagus, seems like the plate was invisible of such. Thanks.
---
Say what you want about Blizzard, but they can really pump out content. One raid tier in WoW is typically as big as *an entire expansion's worth* of raids in GW2 or FFXIV.
---
&gt; double so if it also unlocked a backpack skin, like how Verderarch and Minstrel unlock musical toys.
---
Wish every legendary got some bonus item.
---
* **The Juggernaut:** The [metallic effect](Mystic Chromatic Ooze) as a tonic or an infusion.
---
* **Chuka and Champawat:** Actual baby tiger backpacks.
---
Would make legendaries far more interesting and worth the price.
---
Wait a sec, how does the first SlB have 3 weapon slots? A longbow (Kudzu footsteps), used Greatsword 3 (0:36), and swapped to Sword/Warhorn to escape with Sword2 (0:44).
---
The pact looks pretty good on charr.....
---
Too bad ANET hasn't tried to fix the toes stabbing through the shoe. Which makes me curious. They did a charr specific touch up on the outlaw outfit by adding a gun onto the tail. Why not give them open toe shoes..
---
Is it a dolphin?
---
You can check for yourself in the wardrobe at any bank.
---
There's a mastery point that's supposed to be griffon only, but people got there by breaking the map. For the most part, you're right.
---
&gt; the power of all the gods (past and present)
---
Gonna be a real surprise when you think Aurene has channeled all the gods and then follows it up with [spiders](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Arachnia).
---
Primarily more the community. Just to be clear, I’m only talking my experiences (which are fairly numerous).  Only once or twice have I found a nice group out of maybe 35-40 attempts I’ve made before at raiding. I can go in much deeper detail, and I know there are nice, organized groups, but in the end my experience is almost entirely negative and all I want is legendary armor, but armor with skins only from legendary, not the competitive game mode ones that look the same as ascended.
---
From a narrative perspective there weren't a lot of beats to build up and support a twist like this, and you absolutely need a solid foundation for something like this because trying to move from the emotional gutpunch of this episode's ending to "Oh, hey, you imagined it all" will undercut everything you've built up to this point if the twist isn't something the players have been strongly primed for. Especially considering that the next episode will be the final episode of the season, you need to ratchet up the intensity and the emotional drive as you build to the season climax instead of undercutting it.
---
Given everything we've seen over this season's story arc, I'm happy to wager that Aurene is dead. I also suspect that we'll probably need to go into the Mists to save her soul. The dead, ghosts, death/resurrection and the Mists have all been strong, repeated narrative beats this season so I suspect they'll continue along that theme and tie it all together for the season finale.
---
The ones with hairy feet are hobbits.
---
o_O that is a pretty short gap
---
\+1 sea horse - or a cute little shark :)
---
If devs didn't do anything someone didn't want them to do, we'd be playing PONG.
---
I don't really see anything wrong with that since they aren't going to be using the off season for balance testing.
---
yup 1070ti
---
I'm still so salty that my power went out that night right before you announced the winners.
---
From Sept 11, 2018 *but* still valid. Mike is talking about an upcoming mount. 
---
Ah, we're comparing mobile games to computer games now. Sorry I didn't know we were there already.
---
A good way to judge what's popular or not is to look at the reddit traffic or people on a specific reddit at a specific time. It's not fool proof obviously, but it does tend to back up site listings of popular MMOs.
---
WoW is always out in front, followed by FF XIV.  All the other popular MMOs are generally right around each other. When I say given someone a run for their money, I mean that sometimes the populations shift based on new releases and in between the games are sort of in the same place.
---
No one has numbers to say which game is more populated. But of the places we can get numbers (hint, you can't get Guild Wars 2 numbers on Steam), you can't really tell which game is more populated.
---
But you can get some kind of estimate.
---
Last ten, fifteen times I checked, the Guild Wars 2 reddit had more traffic than the BDO reddit. That doesn't mean it has more players. It can mean that it's just as populated or close to it. That's what a run for your money means. 
---
You'll note I never said which has a higher population, only that they were relatively comparable. No one can say which has a higher population. 
---
