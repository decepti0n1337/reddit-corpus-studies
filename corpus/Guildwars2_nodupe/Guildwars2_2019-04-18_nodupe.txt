Fractals - everything is viable and accepted until you get into the highest tier of difficulty(T4 and Challenge modes).  Mesmer alone or a combo of firebrand and revenant supply the most sought after boons quickness and alacrity.  Warrior has class unique buffs in banners which are very powerful.  Elementalist and Guardian are the most "meta" pure dps but anyone who is skilled on their class can do it.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
PvP - everything is viable and accepted until you get into the highest tier of difficulty(automated tournaments).  Every class works in PvP, it's more about which playstyle suits you better than anything else.  I'd say elementalist is probably in the weakest spot right now in PvP, but still usable.
---
Raids - Mesmer, Warrior, Ranger are in basically every group for tanking/boons/utility/healing.  And again, while some are stronger than others at the absolute highest level of play, basically every class can DPS if they know how to use their class.
---
I'd say mesmer, guardian, warrior, and to a lesser extent ranger and elementalist are going to give you the most versatile/accepted class.  However, you will almost certainly make multiple characters eventually so it's kind of a moot point.  I'd advise picking something you like thematically because by the time you get to the point where you are participating in the higher echelons of this game, you can easily make another character and max them and gear them basically instantly.
---
---
---
...until you make a character taller than an Asura at least.
---
Not entirely true, FFXIV also has a mentor system, and I would argue it is better than GW2s because new players are shown it and given direct ways to contact mentors, and a mentor can add them to a new player and mentor only chat channel. There are also separate mentors for PvE, PvP, Crafting, and All, so you can find a real expert in whatever field you have a question about.
---
This reminds me of the good ol' GW2 killer stairs glitch for a few years after GW2's release.
---
[https://youtu.be/2ASH-aO1RwQ](https://youtu.be/2ASH-aO1RwQ)
---
Yeah, I get what you're saying. I think i'm gonna stick to guardian and just fuck shit up.
---
Any chance you wanna gift an Aura of Displacement to a life long sin main? :D
---
Every aspect was awful, pretty much.
---
Other than Tangled Depths, there were pretty much no events outside the metas, so if you showed up when the outposts were done there was literally nothing to do other than map completion. The events like "Kill the Veteran Mordrem" in VB were either not there or on long cooldowns. 
---
And because of the lack of events, getting experience for Masteries was an unholy grind. Also the story used to require Itzel 4 for no real mechanical reason. In the release window I had to spend 2 entire days grinding to continue the story. With no events outside the metas.
---
And then the currencies were crazy too. Chests dropped half of what they so now, there were less Chests, and events were stingy as all hell giving keys to the point where it was basically a net negative to open them if you were going on map completion. Picture Crystalline Ore, but all 4 maps were nearly that bad.
---
Even non currency rewards. For bladed armor, you *needed* to get to T4 to have a *small chance* of the chest piece dropping. Quick: How often do you see VB hit T4? Basically never, unless a guild sponsors It? It wasn't all that much better on release, because even if you had the coordination and the numbers nobody wanted to bother with low rewards.
---
For the first 6 months many players downright hated HoT because there was no meaningful rewards or progress and it was Korean MMO levels of grindy. HoT 2.0 saved that expansion, though it wasn't until recently that people began to be okay with every map being on a timer.
---
PoF is positively amazing compared to the launch state of HoT. Even with lower rewards there is actual stuff to do other than spamming adventures for exp.
---
Gg at this point is political. It's the same people who hang out in /r/The_Donald, just another culture war sub
---
That's a tricky question. I would say, if you were to choose one, go with chrono. Lots of utility besides of alacrity and quickness (cc, skips, reflects, etc.) and reasonable dps. But as said, I would focus on getting to know one class and doing that neatly. Also, gearing up two classes will be a issue if you are just about to start. The more fractals you play, the more ascneded drops you will have, the easier it is to gear a second / third / ... character :)
---
I think it was scar lane, but in the beginning having more people had a negative effect as it scaled with more people.  You only wanted high dps people there, otherwise it had a negative effect.  I recall they said it wasn’t intentional, but they took a while to acknowledge and fix it.
---
That was a heartfelt congrats... wtf is wrong with you? I WISH I had reached that milestone in GW1.
---
No problem.
---
I'm totally with you about the "META" not being healty for the community. Sadly even GW2 suffer it like a lot of gaming community that have competitive in it. IMO the problem didn't come from the game but from players. A lot of gamers have close mind and will not accept something else than what they see has "META". Just look at Esport game, after each tournament where a new strategie came out and win, everyone start doing it like it was the best way to win. They didn't take into consideration anything else (metagame, skills level of players, the luck factor, etc...) and it's the biggest problem . A lot of build could be playable and competitive, but the community never give them chance to shine until an influencer make a video/post about it. How those influencer have this amount of credibility? We has a community give them this credibility by taking what they say for granted. They never take into consideration all the factor to say this is "META" and IMO they should take that into consideration.
---
This is exactly how I feel summed up. They took all that money from the huge POF release and pissed it all away.
---
Sweet sketch! Stay strong and keep up the nice work :D
---
I feel like they have too many maps as is. I would rather see them go through and improve existing maps, add meta events, add new areas on existing maps, add world bosses, etc.
---
did you just called decapping fun? so standing on point 5 sec is fun... wow you gona love pvp in that case XD
---
That was the best dialogue i ever heard in this game, i came to the same guy every time i could.
---
You are the best sport
---
AUrenes vision showed multiple different locations. So, Id wager your theory falls flat because of that detail. The cave was ONE of many different paths.
---
&gt;  or fashion war at all? 
---
Yea sure, good luck
---
2g from dailies is a good starter to work towards gearing for T4 fractals, which will get you like 10g a day I think? I haven't done them in a while.
---
Not as much as Spamadan tho
---
Shes not a kid anymore. She DID grow up and you can tell. Not just physically, the way she acts, too. Kid Aurene wanted to play. Teen AUrene would actually go out of her way to help people. A child wouldnt do that.
---
I always liked guardian, love dh for fixing most of the things that core missed and hated the fb, im still running my dh power builds, i guess i like the aesthetic and gameplay of the class.
---
&gt; I think its absolute garbage that theyve spent 2 years putting this game on the backburner, most of the content was minor, poorly made, and just made to keep the players running in a circle, or cosmetic stuff only available in gem store.
---
That's the kind is baseless BS Lynsey is talking about the interview. You have no credible source the supports your assumption that GW2 was on the backburner. That's beyond an unfair characterisation of the words people like Josh Foreman used to describe what was happening at ArenaNet before the layoffs.
---
The only person to characterise the company that way is JP, the fired employee with an axe to grind. Fine they won't get your pennies, can we also not get your comments?
---
Boys and girls, but I hope you're Men and Ladies, we will try to do shows as often as I can get the boys together! Come by the bank and the TP to see our shows! They will probably be unannounced!
---
Any reason why you don't have mesmer on power dps too? Power chrono is near the top scale of dps on the current meta.
---
What would be the point though? You wouldn't have anything to offer yourself...
---
&gt;Your "paraphrasing" fails because it assumes mockery, which was not there. I asked questions. Let's check you out though. You started off aggressive and have stayed that way to the point of doing exactly what you accuse me of, though you're incorrect. You criticized both GodLikeKillerB &amp; I for assuming, yet that's what you've done with my first comment. You're trying really hard to misinterpret and chastise me and in the process you avoid addressing what I asked. Why's that?
---
Okay great, I'm glad that other than the "Lol" part, that was an accurate summary of the exchange.
---
Short answer, yes. If you're in a group good enough to burn through phases without needing any heals then you don't need to heal. That said, the odds of you running into that in pugs is extremely rare, like more rare than getting a precursor.
---
Question is - does using chain on gate, grant you extra WXP when gate breaks, or no? If not, then, well, it should. This way, commanders or any caring person dont have to let others use ram for few hits for a bit of World Experience points.
---
lol, it was more like $1k a year or so, so lets not discuss pennies.   I'm allowed my opinions, and correct, I don't have credible sources, I just have my view on how I saw things as a consumer and player.
---
I dont care who Josh Foreman is nor JP.  I see content lessen and a huge set of employees layed off, whilst having less content than previously, less communication than currently (with fewer employees).
---
Go to the trasing post, and set the filters manually.
---
&gt; Armor, exotic, level 80, stats you want.
---
The reason you're doing that is because there are lots of "Named Exotics" that aren't called "Berserkers Plated Chest piece of X". They're cheaper. The difference isn't huge these days, but they're still cheaper.
---
Provided you did your dailies Like, even once while leveling, you probably have enough gold to buy at least a couple pieces.
---
Gotta say it would be my dream job too. Of all things, good or bad, I think of this game and how it's handled, I always felt a "good different" kind of vibe in that aspect. I was sincerely impressed when I saw devs and GMs played with us normally and in the open. I was always of the opinion it's the best thing but never saw it happen in an mmorpg before: The GMs were either working in their administrative character or hidden from the player base. 
---
It was a breath of fresh air and a kind of "I knew this way was better! " moment when I first saw it.
---
I'd prefer a separate pve condi mount. Maybe that upcoming dragon thing will fill that niche already. It seemed to have flame stuff going on...
---
&gt;Ripping a plot point from Dr. Strange will feel lazy.
---
Ignoring the part that it's been done time and time again long before the Dr. Strange movie, the movie doesn't really do the "eternal prison of battle". Strange never intended the loop to last very long, because he knew it would annoy Dormomu. It was meant, as Strange plainly says, as a bargaining chip, not a prison.
---
&gt; I think part of the story will be us realizing that this has happened more than twice. It's happened over and over and over again, extinction after extinction, and episode 6 is the moment we're left with no choice but to kill Kralkatorrik without a replacement or die.  Season 5 will be the fallout of that decision, and the beginning of the end of Tyria. 
---
We already know it's happened countless time. Jotun records have mention of "multiple" rises even before the one that they suffered through. So we know it happened a bare minimum of three times in the past.
---
Though it's unlikely to have happened eternally, because the Elder Dragons are not very eternal.
---
I also doubt we'll actually hit the point where Tyria is dead, and that's what would happen if another Elder Dragon dies without replacement. It would just be a bit too much of a game-ender, especially when ArenaNet is now forced to maintain GW2 for profit by big brother ncsoft. It would also be weird to include a dragon mount without a dragon replacement (or explain why that mount cannot become an Elder Dragon despite the fact we're riding it into magic).
---
&gt;Note that before the layoffs happened, the GW2 twitter was sending out timed tweets of lore for each of the gods, and the BLTC weapon set (which might have originally released alongside episode 6) is themed after the gods and is called "Defiant". I think these are in reference to us finding out who the gods really are, and either acting in defiance of them or the Eternal Alchemy.
---
While I do want to know what was up with the god tweets, they were lined up to be finished with the original date for the Warclaw release. Which also added the Defiant Glass weapons. I doubt it ties to Episode 6 - they've never done such alluding beforehand, and if they ever included a BLC weapon set in an episode, it actually was released simultaneously. I don't see how the gods at all relate to the plot, nor how rising in defiance of them is either a good plot or at all different (after all, four of the five race choices either don't care or actively dis on the Six Gods, and we already acted in defiance of a fallen god). The name seems to more stem from the fact that the glass defy physics, both being unbreaking and floating in air. There's also the thorns, which could allude to defiance to the wielder. Either way, I doubt they'd allude to a future plot with BLC weapons for the first time ever.
---
So overall, I disagree with everything you said. :) We'll find out in a few weeks.
---
I didn't know what they were? Are they people who are happy to answer questions?
---
I main both, 2 Guardians and recently, a Thief / DareDevil / Deadeye.  
---
Guardian, especially DragonHunter put out a massive amount of damage it's kinda addicting. Firebrand i love burning down and buffing everyone during fights (my only slight is if you get underwater and out again, you have to recast the skills no matter how long you were underwater). Aegis is a great lifesaver, especially against enemies with obvious attack coming on. Also, Aegis give you one free attack nullified without  affecting yourself (can still change skills, run top speed, etc). Cant tell you how many times that save my skin in Jumping Puzzles.  
---
Thief, backstabbing enemy is fun but alone, you need to use dodge a lot.  I love the Thief Elite skill, summon more thief and another skill, summon a thief. It's always funny and awesome when you go against an enemy, and suddenly 4 more people shows up to gang up against them.  DareDevil, i love using spec that crit damage heals me, plus that with the healing skill that heals when you damage enemies, i just jump straight into a fight dishing damage while jumping around. Deadeye, just sits and deal damage to boss from a far. Mark em, Stack them Malice, Stealth, then shot them for a massive damage.

* Malchors leap elder wood
---
This only works if you have mulitple characters and works even better if you can multimap it but that requires other players. You pretty much spam interact on trees, change character and do it again.
---
* Trading post
---
Usually, this requires more time than 20mins as you need to figure out what's profitable. Log in, do your trades/crafts/whatever, list sell orders and come back tomorrow
---
* Map completion
---
Map completion gives you 2 gifts of exploration which, combined with the gift of battle from wvw can be sold for about 500gold each, perhaps a bit more. You won't get gold immediately but rather in one big spike every couple of weeks/months.
---
* Daily T4 fractals
---
They should take less than an hour to complete and yield about 20gold
---
True, the word "never" wasn't said, but what was said is that they have a "rule about Living World maps being present on the overworld parchment". Which is the same as saying "maps will always be in the overworld parchment (at the moment, only Tyria/Elona)". Or "maps will always not be in the Mists" and "always not" is the same as "never".
---
Semantical argument but the same point is made whether the word "never" was used or not.
---
And an "unless" is never mentioned.
---
By the statement, the only way we'll get a map in the Mists, is if it's placed in the overworld parchment that PvP/WvW uses. Which would just be wonky af.
---
Me too. I honestly feel that mount skill damage needs to be scaled down a bit more in lower level areas.
---
Of course, it being as it is I try not to use it when other players are nearby.
---
this meme sucks
---
Except the karma converter wvw supplies don't stack with the others &gt;.&lt;
---
I mean after this suggestion ;D
---
Basically  shit like this are part of the reason every single veteran has completely abandonded lfg and is strictly raiding with statics through discord. All that remains are groups that can hardly clear vg, LI fakers joining groups that disband as soon as the first wipe and raid sellers.  As far as im concerned people can go ahead and fake LI 24/7 cause the damage to pug raids has been already done and it is beyond repair.
---
To be fair, this is in reference to an open world event.  It’s for casual people too.  Not everyone would be geared up or as skilled as they need to be for higher tiered fractals or raids.
---
They're literally just pulling shit from the unformed spaces between worlds. That's the whole fun of them.
---
You take that back!
---
Jalis isn't even confirmed to be dead, and could very well be still alive in tyria. And we also channeled Joko at one point, after He returned.
---
IIRC JP actually provided concrete examples.
---
On the contrary, I think the modern perception of these things is warped. That why people have gotten so psychologically weak and continue to get weaker.
---
And many of the people that live month to month are doing that of their own accord by choosing to live beyond their means. And even though relocation is tough, I wouldn't call it trauma. Numerous people throughout history have had to relocate at times to get by. People should not go in with the expectation that they'll be able to just stay in one location their entire life. It's great if it happens, but should not be the expectation.
---
https://xkcd.com/109/
---
Jahai Bluffs is 1 map and followed by probably the worst LS map they've done.
---
All Mallyx did was boss around a bunch of demons after their boss died, and then got killed. Barely anyone at all would know who he was.
---
Summoning yourself would allow you to channel the skills and abilities of yourself, which wouldn't actually enhance you in any way because you can already do anything you can do.
---
I'm slowly getting there. I can navigate Verdant Brink pretty easily now even without mounts but Tangled Depths is still a maze in the northern portion.
---
Another misdirection. What is it you're doing here?
---
Just want to say that I decided to play based on what I read in the replies here and in a few other threads. Hope to see you in game :P
---
I do not understand why you felt compelled to type this out. This is demonstrably false given the continuation of the Living World, balance patches, the new fractals, two (soon to be three) new mounts, and a complete restructure to double down on GW2 following the layoffs. Like... you don't create an ad campaign like the one we are seeing now for maintenance mode.
---
[PoF MSQ Spoiler](#s "Just visited the library where the goddess resides, I had dreams as a child that looked like that - its been a very long time since I had a nerdgasm like this one in a videogame, only thing that saddens me it that I have started to play GW2 this late")
---
Thank you so much for putting this into words. I've been so hyped lately but so at odds with the popular theories coming out.
---
I think you really hit the nail on the head. We can't just keep riding the line between tragedy and victory forever-- we need to defy what we've always known and embrace the consequences. I really hope things play out the way you describe. That's where my real hype is.
---
It's probably more-so that HoT maps feel like there is something active to be doing almost the entire time you are in the map. You are given event driven direction and you don't have to go around hunting for something to do while you wait for a timed meta to begin. It isn't about the value of what's given currency-wise, its about the value the player gives to the map itself. So while there might be more gold to find in LW maps, players have more fun and enjoyment in some of the HoT maps, so they hold more value in that degree. Nobody here gave me my opinion on it, it's just how things felt once LW maps began feeling more... rinse/repeat with what was given. LS4 stepped it up a bit, but overall it doesn't change how things feel, for me at least.
---
there are plenty of significant changes that don't rise to the level of trauma if the people are in the habit of appreciating the things that they do have at any given time and keeping in mind the many people that haven't had those things. People throughout history have done all sorts of things to get by, whether it is finding other groups to share accommodations with to reduce bills (plenty of times and places throughout history, there have been multiple families that end up living under the same roof) or relocating to where other work is available. People just did what they needed to do and moved on. If a given standard of living was necessary for people to be happy, 99% of the people that lived before the 20th century should have been depressed and had PTSD. Yet those people were still able to be psychologically resilient and get by and find happiness in small things.
---
I kinda like that idea, sadly it ruins the magic a bit when you find out that a lot of the shiny stuff is gem store only. Instead of "wow cool, I wonder what endgame stuff rewards me with that" it's often "wonder how much real money that costed". I'm not judging anyone for using their money as they will but it kinda sucks knowing that I'll never get the shiniest shinies cause I'm not buying microtransactions.
---
It honestly wasn't as bad as people say.  In some ways, I actually miss it - the feeling of "gotta explore to find the way" and then "oh, I know the way now!" is replaced with "just throw myself at it with the Springer".
---
I wouldn't mind the time gate but I despise all hearts. Doing them all for 16 days was a real chore. Never again.
---
You're an embarrassment, stop giving out bad advice
---
From what I recall from release, no.
---
Incredibly well done, bro. This is exactly how I'd imagine Koda.
---
Speaking as one of Gw2exchanges most reputable traders, that particular trading channel is a great place to be able to maximize on gains with a great player-base of successful trades ranging from low and high-end items, not to mention there are quite a few names there that are known for trading beyond TP-limits amount which should nullify any doubt in that individual when trading, none of it is against the rules unless you directly trade something you're not supposed to. The subreddit has rules clarifying what isn't allowed and how to post correctly. Of course, if both trading parties aren't able to trust each-other then you may use one of the trusted middle-men to proceed with trades.
---
Dude, fantastic drawing! Consider re-posting to /r/ImaginaryTyria. 
---
Also I misread the title as Vodka of Koda, which I would totally buy haha
---
I was going to downvote this because it's well-deserved, but then I realized that's what you actually wanted and I'd be playing right into your hands. So instead, I won't downvote you. I will, however, [leave you with this.](https://i.imgur.com/D9mGB9J.jpg)

Yea.... I figured it out when he replied haha for some reason in my head I thought at first that it was his initials

Ok but HoT was how long ago? This is like complaining about Game of Thrones ads showing the ~~wyverns~~ Dragons...

Here I am, *still* without a griffon of my own because reasons. Which I won't get into because Reddit. Disappointing that I've let it go this long.

At least it's not that damned Owl....

If you are going for Rifle Deadeye, make sure to dress him up like a pirate. Equip pirate runes for a parrot. Equip Thieves Guild and Ambush Trap. You get a full pirate crew.

With [Payback Trait](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Payback), that long cooldown that thieves guild has is drastically reduced to a short time.

So cool!

im doing daily cms with druid in group for 6 months.druid IS amazing healer,IF your group doesnt take 15k dmg every 2 sec. in bad group any support is useless.
---
After daily runs each day (minus 2 or 3 where I had real life issues to deal with), this is the best run I scraped together. Better than my 59 last year! But, not WR yet. I want to try more but AFAIK I have work tomorrow. 
---
This is SUCH a rough run too, it's kinda embarrassing but I wanted to post my best time. I KNOW I can beat WR if I had enough time to really get into this, I'll miss SAB a LOT. Wish we'd get a home instance version.
---
Kudos to Sheeppo for many of the newer skips I use here! He'll probably end up blowing my run out of the water by tomorrow.
---
Amazing level design? No, I have to say no as someone who has played this game since launch, POF Maps are much better in terms of design.
---
Meta events I will agree, the metas in HOT are great fun and for sure better than POF's which is a shame.
---
Lol who uses gliders anymore? 
---
Minigames....I've never played them, perhaps Im missing out

I honestly don't know what you're trying to do here, other than nitpick at what I'm saying. Ofc having that kind of responsibility as an adult would suck, and I didn't even try implying otherwise.
---
I just think that life has been incredibly unfair towards Aurene, who is realistically only a few years old, a child, a *baby* by dragon standards probably, and that I really hope that she's not doomed to a time loop of fighting Kralk for all eternity.
---
GW1 PvP felt like a card game made videogame. It was super heavy on strategy and choosing your "deck" (skills) wisely for the upcoming battle. GW2 PvP is fun but pretty much everyone can do anything and everything is kinda leveled, anyone can go up against anyone.
---
You shouldn't be doing hearts as your main leveling content anyways. Dynamic Events are the meat and potatoes of leveling, hearts are just an epicenter for DE's.
---
Walrus does a really good job outlining the various segments of rotations in his video.  He starts from core Guardian DPS then moves on to DH and pDPS Quickbrand.  They're all fairly similar and absolutely worth watching.  For the most part it's all about symbolic avenger, F1 tether and whether or not you can fit the core skills mentioned in the initial introduction into a "trait-abuse" window.
---
Hey I recognize you from the eso sub! Love your shots.
---
I had the same problem. Got pretty good at HoT mobs, but stepped into PoF and I was just getting slaughtered by everything.
---
I don't exactly know what's so different, but I did adjust subconsciously after a while and now I hold my own pretty well.
---
Druid is off meta, that is correct. There are better healers, and there are better boon supports. Playing or requiring druid is nowadays just because people are used to it from before.
---
**Stopping playing ranger might not mean stopping having fun, though**. Other classes have also pretty decent playstyles and maybe you will like some as well. But you will never know until you try it. After all, ascended equipment can be usually shared across toons, so in that way you have quite good position. But I would rather recommend to make new sets for other toons, so you always have the character ready to just relog and play with. It is pretty much worth it to not need to deal with "where I put the equip to", and in general having good pool of equipment is not bad as well.
---
Actually, it wouldn't work as you think. See, a Revenant summons a Legend to become that Legend. If you summon yourself, you become a Legendary Revenant with the ability of summoning your Legends, but you already are one. So it's a case of copy/pasting.
---
You summon yourself to become yourself, but you already are yourself. Nothing changes.
---
This of course opens some debates: are we still ourselves when we summon ourselves? The answer is yes, because Revenants become Legends but they also retain their identity mixed in it. So you would be your past self with your past memories and skills, and your present self with your present memories and skills. But that is just being yourself in any moment. So nothing changes here again.
---
A better approach would be to plan out your projects...
---
For new player there is a cheaper alternative to get to 150 AR:
---
2x +7 on your weaponsets (14 AR) 
---
8x +8 on anything (64 AR) 
---
8x +9 on anything (72 AR)
---
When you need another weaponset you just need to have 2x +7 for it.
---
It might be more common and cheaper to not infused the back item no? The current cost of ecto is around 20 silver and to infused the back item you'll need a stack of them. Use more +9s and +8s on the trinkets and rings might save some gold and headache of attaining the parts for infusing the back item.
---
Higher agony is good if you can afford it. The higher agony adds up in the fractal offence booster thingy.
---
I blindly put all +9s in all my gear...
---
Seen one dude with 315 agony, he had a lot of +15s...did higher average damage also...
---
Life is a trial,
---
You sound like a person that has never experienced actual financial hardship that the majority of the world face.
---
LS1 wasn't especially high quality either. The better parts were okay but some of the other bits like the invasions were very shallow.
---
&gt; Just shoulders and back items pretty much...
---
There was also a hat and an very(?) rare rifle.
---
I wouldn't say boon chrono/quickbrand are subpar dps, sure it won't be DH/Slb/Weaver burst/levels of dps but considering all the utility, the diviner gear, runes etc and having to run 3 support utility skills, it's pretty good damage.
---
Mostly talking about Chrono since i've never played quickbrand myself but power quickbrand does really well.
---
Thank you too!
---
At first, they look like materia from ff7
---
If you can dig it, get a set of armor for power soulbeast. 
---
I regularly switch between dps and healing on my firebrand depending on the groups skill level.
---
That'd be a fun new Rev spec - "Narcissist"
---
i can chime in as someone who has, i don't even have a house. i agree with what tranquil is saying, people these days need to be more resilient. losing a job isn't trauma, you pick yourself up and get back to it. make smart decisions and don't complain if you make a bad one, just fix it or work on fixing it, there's no use sitting around moping

i was replying to 1996 and by extension, kataiser, who was referring to the opinion piece crap that they put out without fact checking
---
CC'ed Mordy before 3rd bite? Have fun in banland, bucko.
---
Contact support? That's about the only thing I can think of.
---
They must be dedicated for some competitive reason right? There's not that much to complete over in Gw2 PvE, especially for guild related content, so it's hard to imagine what a serious guild would be doing. Mandatory guild missions?
---
In the fractal you can use some potions (mobility/defensive/offensive). You can purchase, for a lot of relics, the "infinite" versions (they are REALLY great to have if you plan to do fractals often). Once you've those 3 infinite potions, there is a recipe to merge them into 1 single "omnipotion" (meaning less slots taken by the potions in a shared inventory slot for example)
---
Your phrasing kind of sounds like "All Lives Matter" rhetoric which is often used to put down the support of marginalized people in favor of the argument "But Everyone Is Equal!"
---
Just what I take from the phrasing though . They may have thought you were trying to be a dick about it
---
the forum mods are a bit special sometimes
---
Yeah, this is just plain not true and shows you don't play guardian much. In PvP I leap in and out of combat with multiple players, often bursting them down and still surviving with the Radiance core build. Guardian flourishes in AoE situations with symbols, whirling wrath, protection, stability, and many other tools on demand compared to other classes that don't have that same easy access. On the scepter focus set they can even CC, set up blocks, train a target from range, and weave in/out of melee. And in PvE, the support of Litany of Wrath timed right against burst, with traps, and ridiculous DPS, Guardian may have the lowest HP, but one of the most survivable classes if you know what you're doing. Just like Thief has paper defenses, but if you know what you're doing, it's an incredibly survivable class.
---
I could see that being an issue with my first response. But my second response I thought I was being pretty clear that I was just concerned over anet not being accurate about the charity they are supporting in their news post.
---
First time posting there?
---
Anet forums are an actual tire fire. Don't even bother, seriously.
---
I believe I read it somewhere that they modeled the GW1 skill system based on MTG, so that's probably why you got that feeling.
---
I'm looking to build a heal scrapper for raid/fractals.  Are the boons converted  from the trait Purity of Purpose affected by concentration?
---
Yeah I was working on that, all I have left is the 100 portal spikes, and it's just annoying. Hop map to map to find a meta, &lt; 5 people doing it so it doesn't scale, there's &lt; 10 spikes to go around before the portals are done and you probably aren't gonna get all 3 done with so few people so you don't even get to finish the meta.
---
The wurm event and maw should be scheduled like every half hour alternating.
---
you shouldn't play druid if you have boon renegade in your group
---
For what and how much is your budget? If you're thinking open world then there are a lot of cheap options and it really doesn't matter much. For raids and fractals there are only specific foods that you'll want you can check [some options for meta and budget here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character#Food). If you're looking for WvW something like [lemongrass poultry soup](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pot_of_Lemongrass_Poultry_Soup) or [tray of saffron bread](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tray_of_Saffron_Bread) work well.
---
Yes in T1 and dungeons, a druid is totally useless. Healing is only needed in higer tiers, end T3, T4
---
Okay, that’s a fair point. My elementalist is wearing the elegy pants right now. I was so happy to see a proper simple pair of pants in game for light armor.
---
you dont have to get to exactly 150 agony resistance
---
Just out of curiosity, why did you move on from ZoS?
---
Spoiler? They added new story content in the last 28 days?
---
Honestly, I feel like this is a better setup:
---
\- Armor parts all 6 x 9's
---
\- Rings 6 x 9's
---
\- Trinkets 2 x 7's
---
\- Backpack 2 x 7's
---
\- Weapons 4 x 7's
---
This makes it 150 AR exactly, assuming you have an infused backpack, probably cheaper to not infuse and buy some higher AR infusions though.
---
This setup would be 12 x 9 AR and 8 x 7 AR instead of your proposed 14 x 9 and 6 x 7 AR.
---
sometimes?
---
Do you mean feast, one you feed to everyone in the map? Power would be the best, condi would be second most important one. If you WvW, toughness and vitality probably.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Food use the filters
---
They are a latino community advocating social justice between all races.
---
I dont see a contradiction here.
---
Looks like it was fixed when the tonics were added to the novelties in Oct 2018. There were some threads on it but I wasn't aware of it until now.
---
We recently had gemstore March sales so i don't expect to see any sales soon.
---
And if you mean sales on game itself then i suggest you to buy from digital official retailers websites
---
yeah they want to keep their forums clean to now allow anything even remotely offending anyone, allowing close to no critic, where then only the fluff and patch notes are left.
---
just let it be and use reddit like anyone else
---
got a warning yesterday too because i posted that  Maguuma Pact Operation Portal Device is usless and not worth the price.  it was flaged as "off-topic or derailing posts".
---
Sorry  but respecting closed raids and groups doing other things was common courtesy on the stronger servers.
---
You tell me to play with them but I've lead pugs hundreds of hours and others did the same.
---
With the current state of the game this is no longer feasible. Your ideals are irrelevant. There are so many pugs looking to use you for whatever they see fit that if you allow anything, you literally get overrun with players on EU prime.
---
If you lead open for anyone frequently hundreds of pugs will transfer for action, butnthey still wont listen or play with you. You're at their mercy because you invited them, while they strain and bully your community.
---
Wvw has gotten a lot more dire since late hot. Also a wvw static lul. feels na man.
---
Oh got it! Thanks for clarifying.
---
Druid is the best offensive support in the game, bringing the most necessary boons in might, fury, regen, and protection and additional damage via Frost Spirit and Empowerment. However, if your group has already covered the basic boons with that Herald, then there are plenty of alternate healers you can try.  
---
Healing Firebrand would give your group access to quickness, and has good healing output. Healing Renegade can give you access to Alacrity. Scrapper healer has access to great defensive options. Scourge healer has strong utility and mass rez potential. Staff tempest has the best healing output, but is kind of lacking in utility and isn't very engaging to play.  
---
  
---
In terms of play style, Firebrand and Boon Tempest are probably the only things similarly complex. Boon Tempest has rather low healing, doing about 2k heals p/s compared to Druid's 3.5k hps The other classes are fairly straight forward.  
---
If you really want to stick with Druid, you can always switch out Grace of the Land with Lingering Light to forgo might for extra healing, while keeping the insane utility a Druid brings. Then if you ever need to bring the might it's just a trait-switch away. You'd get more healing with magi's, but harriers is still totally fine as you don't need super high healing for fractal content!
---
Devs already scaled that down but it's still way too strong in low level zones; I'm doing dailies regularly since 2013 and since PoF introduction each time there's daily event objective in old maps, I'm seeing low level players trying to tag anything but they hardly can due to mounts usage.
---
"[la Raza](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Raza)" as "all races" seems like a mistranslation to me, as the term refers specifically to hispanics.
---
It's also congruent with the other expressions used ("for the Latino" / "of our people")
---
**La Raza**
---
The Spanish expression la Raza (literally "the Race") refers to the Hispanophone populations (primarily though not always exclusively in the Western Hemisphere), considered as an ethnic or racial unit historically deriving from the Spanish Empire, and the process of racial miscegenation of the Spanish colonizers with the indigenous populations of the New World (and sometimes Africans brought there by the Atlantic slave trade).The term was in wide use in Latin America in the early-to-mid 20th century but has gradually been replaced by Hispanidad in some countries. It remains in active use specifically in the context of Mexican-American identity politics in the United States.

Perhaps you bought the game through some other outlet, not directly from Arenanet shop directly?

GamerGate
---
Well what game mode you want changes what is useful and what your options are. Like no one wants [meatball dinners](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Meatball_Dinner) but they cost nothing... Something like [fire flank stake](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Feast_of_Fire_Flank_Steak) is ~70s to craft and gives power + condition damage if you just want an ok general food but things like 
---
[feast of steak and asparagus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Feast_of_Steak_and_Asparagus) are better for power and [feast of veggie pizza](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Feast_of_Veggie_Pizzas) is better for condi. Also there are many many cheaper and more expensive options but I ignored them to give you the more meta food that was in your budget range. The [large wiki list of food](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Food) has all the feasts listed as well if you wanted other options.
---
&gt;"Druid is off meta, that is correct."  
---
Wtf lol in what universe. Druid is the best offensive support in the game still that hasn't changed.
---
Looks very cool but there's something... off with the head.
---
I mean, the head looks cleaner compared to the rest of the body (I really like how the body looks tbh)
---
I like it very much :D
---
Yeah, I noticed that as well but wanted to keep my post on the forums strictly to be about anet and the charity website stating different things. 
---
A friend of mine also mentioned that the phrase is pretty heavily associated with mexican irredentism.
---
&gt;yeah they want to keep their forums clean as fk, to not allow anything even remotely offending anyone and allowing close to no critic.
---
Yep, my reason to ditch the official forums for good. Bunch of wussies.
---
the forums are for marketing and reddit is for discussion. this is the case with nearly every game
---
I play fractals pretty casually, do them when I have time and feel like doing them (I do the T4's I like and then usually all recs, not every day). Would you still recommend me getting the omnipot, or buying the single ones?
---
Even when playing healer in fractals, I usually switch to DPS in lower tiers. Ennemies are too weak to justify at that level.
---
my hunch is they will release the trailer same week they play episode 5 and then we get the patch on the 30th
---
/r/guildrecruitment
---
Hum, the idea to Dr. Strange Kralk is actually fun. How exactly, though? The Dessa/Arkk loop for instance works (as far as I can tell) because neither of them is actually alive. The exploration party that witnesses it is able to leave the loop at will.
---
That was fast! Thank you!
---
Well, that's only inertia of previous balance patches, nowadays you can easily substitute druid with other, usually more suitable builds. That's after all whole point of this threat...
---
That's not saying it is not usable. But by definition, even being 0,01% worse already means not top meta. Don't dig into it, you can still play whatever you want, it still have on par results, and still have good receptance, because most people don't really care if you are 99% meta or 100% meta. **It is just not mandatory anymore**, there are other otions, that can even give better results once the community gets proper grasp of them.
---
Have you tried dropping 9 rams on one gate? Pretty sure siege cap prevents it.
---
Dropping 6 rams isn't uncommon among organised groups, its just organised groups that are uncommon.
---
Having empathy for other ethnicities is not politics, is a decent human person thing
---
That's not the issue at all though. I don't know how you managed to misinterpret my post so badly.
---
I don't care whether the charity is for a single race or all races. My concern was that anet's news post stated something that was against what the actual charity says. Anet says the charity is for the latino community while the charity says its for unification of all races. Those statements don't match. My post was purely concern over whether or not anet even looked at the website or if they just heard "latino" and were like "oh a charity for latinos? okay sure we will do it."
---
I just don't want another kung fu tea disaster.
---
Chocolate cookies! You can't never have enough chocolate cookies
---
But why add more things to do to maps that are already populated and popular? Why not instead add it on maps that people aren't already flocking to?
---
Yeah, ~ 20k fractal relics may seem scary but it really isn't that bad. To get omnipot you gonna need 1385 pristine fractal relics, that is around 3 months of doing t4's but you can get 100 pristine relics from tyrian exchange voucher, which you can buy from SAB weekly vendor.
---
a power quickbrand does a shitton more dps then a support chrono and renegade brings perma alacrity on 1 button press with a shitton of heal via kalla heal + elite. both in combo sustain might, fury, protection, give additional heals, have lifeleech, many blocks and other cc.  
---
pugs are just slow in catching up and you can't be braindead while playing this, since facetanking everything doesn't work as well.  
---
but just because pugs don't play it, doesn't mean its not meta.  
---
that being said, op is not even in t3 as it sounds. druid is the worst support you can get in t1 / 2 where not even alacrity is needed since everything dies as fast as in dungeons. means after using 2 to 3 burst skills. what you want to heal? your own spirits?
---
The best-in-slot gear is Ascended &amp; Legendary (Legendary only adding the option to swap stats on the go).  
---
There is a chance for Ascended to drop in raids etc. But you are able to craft it yourself without having to grind raids/fractals.
---
what was the post about :D ?
---
^This^ 
---
Just go to the subreddit and search for the seller or buyer reputation (BEFORE you meet in game).
---
And YES if you get scammed and report the guy he won’t just get a ban in game... He will be perma banned from the reddit! 
---
Sooo the exchange community is really safe (if you do your homework and only deal with high rep sellers/buyers)
---
Also this poster “Souls” really is a super seller over there so you can believe what he’s saying (a bunch of them buy/sell items worth more then x4 leggy put together)... multiple Queen bee’s and just stupidly rich rich rich stuff.
---
Dealing with someone who has 9 or 10 times your wealth is a great way to minimize the chances they would steal your little precursor drop, or Gift, or whatever it is you are selling (that they already own half a stack of)
---
So YES go there and join the great exchange community but don’t forget to check the rep or sales/post history of every single person BEFORE you meet in game. (SCAMS DO HAPPEN)
---
Good luck with all you do!
---
&gt; I don't know how you managed to misinterpret my post so badly.
---
but keep in mind, if real human could misinterpret it so badly, then whatever anet bot interprets should not be a shock at all.
---
Hahaha funny, that's my favourite map of that season! 
---
Great mastery, great story, great design of the map (you're lost at first then you get to know every corner of the map), and I really like the events too. Don't really mind waiting 16 days for the backpack since I've played for 6 years, isn't much ^^
---
Nein, nein, nein, nein, nein....
---
[Nope.](https://www.picclickimg.com/d/l400/pict/323647724356_/Asterix-et-Obelix-chevaux-carte-postale-cp-postcard.jpg)
---
Tall human are bigger than short norns, so are their mounts.
---
It's not the size, it's how you use it!
---
Yes, only character height affects it.
---
If it became race specific Asura's would be running around on pocket raptors, so let's not.
---
(IV) delete Warclaw.
---
At the moment aside from insane buff to any T3 defense Warclaw brings nothing to table except swiftness for poor traitless guardians. Chain pull not an issue of Warclaw. WvW objective cap balance is an issue.
---
&gt; slightly better composition  
---
is not just slightly better. it performs way over the top. being able to burst down viirastra before the bouncing orb even touches the ground or the bomb explodes for example.  
---
the difference is having 4 dps and 1 which still does more damage then a druid / supportchrono would do. pugs may not be able to be this bursty because of skill, but alone this setup already ups the overall damage of the squad WAY more then running the other setup.  
---
kalla elite + heal and quickbrand tomes are enough to have the group on 100% of their health all the time.  
---
ONTOP you can have s shitton of stability again, which got nerfed in the old setup.  
---
it won't take too long until pugs realise this setup is better...and if heals are really needed, either quickbrand or renegade can also just spec into heal.  
---
the squadsetup in terms of offensive and defensive boons is just way superior. same goes to cc.
---
Well, that settles the Asura/Charr war hypothesis, eh eh.
---
Na
---
Link it to the OP, not me? Honestly, one mediocre build, that doesn't have any evidence of it being played successfully, that might not get kicked from a "melee train squad" isn't going to change my mind that the balance in Guild Wars 2 is beyond pitiful but I appreciate the effort!
---
Yeah very nice of course but 11 mio users? Find that hard to believe. But then I mostly do spvp.

---
But there aren’t that many classes/places to slot more power into anyway (except Chrono where you can go up to 300+ and still need more assassins’/precise infusions). Most classes critcap with 150AR.
---
The OP’s sentence about someone having 315AR and doing higher average dps is a bit misleading because if you’re already critcapping at 150, increasing it to 315 (or 400) doesn’t matter at all. There’s a cap to this “dps boost”.
---
Don't underestimate the amount of precision you get from the pot. 1 agony resistance gives 1,5 precision. So for every 14 ar you get 1% crit chance. That's huge. Although by doing this you're going to lose out on the +5 stat points from the stat infusions. If you're missing a lot of precision to crit cap it might be more beneficial to get higher ar infusions because you gain more than 90 power from changing your assassin's gear to berserkers.
---
&gt; I want to see them fully commit
---
They are already. ATM PvE content consists from:
---
- 3 HoT metas xx:45 you go for VB and then do TD + AB
---
- Then you go for Branded Shaterrer (or afk till xx:45) and Palawadan.
---
- Then you do T4 fractals in 30-45 min.
---
Congrats you have nothing to do, because all other content is not profitable enough and you are punished for repeating metas. You could not repeat fractals because it is pointless. In perfect world we should have 24h chain worth of meta events with the same reward level. But then how it is really different from 24h SW farm? Like have you seen AB lately? It is done in one burst, because people done it for hundred times already and it as brainless as SW.
---
Well, like I noted, building a new map with its own huge meta events just spreads the population thinner, and makes a lot of those metas impossible to complete, and therefore worthless, once the community has moved on. That's why, [Part A], I think it's a good idea to *not* put these new metas on a new map, and instead put them on an existing map with a stable population. 
---
Does that, in and of itself, make sense?
---
But then if that's *all* they do, then we aren't getting *new* maps, ones that expand the world in new and interesting directions, and as an explorer, that would bum me out. 
---
So [Part B] is that they *also* make new maps to explore, and they would have smaller events that only require a few players to complete, no huge metas to draw attention, there would be stuff to do there, but the stuff that existing maps have that most players finish within a week or two after it launches. The maps would be designed for each player to go through at their own pace and clear out the content, but wouldn't split the population more thinly overall. 
---
Do you see the value in both aspects?
---
idk but my mounts are always bigger than anyone's else. No matter if I play charr, human or asura. Same size with every character.
---
what's disingenious is to call the community pre-influx a hate mob. I already agreed that there were outliers, there always are. but if you use those to profile the whole community then that's far an accurate representation. the discussions were mostly civil, apart from a few vocal but quickly downvoted asses, like every other time something controversial happens. the real, actual hate, calls to doxxing and so forth only started en masse when the sub suddenly had twice or more as many users as normal.
---
I trust that they know what they are doing. You don't have one of the most successful MMOs alive and well 7 years after released if not.
---
&gt; Anet says the charity is for the latino community
---
I checked 3 times and I couldnt find where Anet states that the charity is **for** the latino community.
---
yeah, there was some vitriol even before outsiders came and fanned the flames, but all in all the first few hours the discussions were somewhat civil, if maybe a bit heated. after that it exploded, and that wasn't a representation of the gw2 community but rather how easily it is for politically motivated groups to hop on any bandwagon and start derailing.
---
before the whole media shitstorm there were calls for firing her, but not overly abusive ones, they often simply cited her previous behavior and claimed she would never change anyway and even with an apology she would do more harm than good in the long run, and I can't say it's an unreasonable stance, at least since they made their arguments clear. after all that it started to degrade into less of an argument and more of a hate mob, but considering the timings it's pretty clear the instigators were not from within the community, even if some members may have picked it up.
---
If you think you aernt needed head to daimos and see the difference it makes if you don't get ported downstairs. Trust me you make a difference
---
stop being poor
---
I mainly play thief. Because of style, dynamic and interesting combat (killing enemies with stealth is really satysfying). I have tried every class in the game. Nothing can bring me more fun than playing a ninja style (or sniper atm).
---
Try it, you won't regret. One of my first character was guardian, but then I have created a thief. That was a moment when I realized "this will be my main character".
---
You're speaking as if your words are facts, you would do well to go read some of those threads again, and perhaps look at user data around the period where this sub had 'twice or more' than the 203,000 users it currently has. This is part of what I was stating, 'not me/us' in hindsight. Anyway, we'll agree to disagree, opinions are opinions :)
---
If working on old maps only produces new mata events, i'm not so interested; i would expect some new areas, or changes to existing dead spots into something useful. This would not leave time for Plan B. Otherwise sure, let's make a new map with less metas full of stories and side stories - huge meta does not make a map, it can exist or not i don't mind, as long as it does not lock the major content from exploring (which they usually do, idk).
---
I just want A be something more, which would not leave B as an option. If A is minor, B shoud be the main option. Better have 1 good thing, than 2 mediocre things.
---
I showed where what the blog post and what the charity said were different. It's not a quote from the website because if it was then it wouldn't be different. If they had put the same words as on the charity website then this would not be an issue. 
---
I made no personal assumptions about the charity or what it does. I never claimed they excluded people or mentioned anything about race unless it was included in a quote. 
---
YOU are the one trying to turn this into some kind of weird racial drama. Stop it.
---
&gt; Bad - They should have been working on it since the "Path of Fire" expansion!
---
You could just create a strawpoll like this: https://www.strawpoll.me/17838939 btw.
---
I main druid. Full harrier raid druid and even I sometimes don't fractal t4 on druid. Partially because it gives me a nice change but partially because we can mostly do without. There are certain combos of instabilities though where the group is screaming out for druid simply because the combos are shockingly bad.
---
He looks kinda frustrated. At least he seems he's going: "how did you bunch of sissies get driven south by that lot of weightlifting fanatics!?!?!".
---
That's the general vibe that I get. I know he's depicted as menacing, but it jus didn't work that way with me haha
---
The quote anet used seems to be very race specific, especially compared to the other line on the website. And just to be clear, I don't have anything against the charity itself, I was mainly confused over the seemingly contradictory statements and concerned that anet didn't do more than a cursory glance before getting involved in something.
---
so they create a new map shard for everybody that uses that device or are they just creating a new map shard once all other shards are full and then everybody fills up the new shard?
---
PoF maps felt dead on arrival, haven't spent many hours on any of the ones that came with the expansion.
---
I used to think about that way back when, and I think it might be worth doing for something like Orr where there is a massive difference over time, but the problem is if they did it just all over the place, it would further split the population. Two Queensdales would be two entirely different maps. Not to mention that it would probably mess with the world map. 
---
I think the only way they could show time progressing on a single map is if they built it in such a way that the enemies and collision data remained the same between the two, and the differences were purely cosmetic changes and dialog NPCs, and they could feed different versions to two different players playing together on the same map.
---
Honestly, a good Dungeon group only needs 1 power quickbrand and is good2go.
---
Rifle Deadeye.
---
Take DPS build and make one change: take Invorigating precision in Critical Strikes trait line. You will thank me when you will be able to easily solo champs. Your main heal skill can be used for condi cleanse. 4th riffle skill works as a smoke screen. Deadeye is also a great self-support (gain 25 stacks of might, fury, vigor and swiftness after reaching full malice).
---
I love it too :) Too bad I find the energy management and "legend chatter" of the class annoying enough to just keep that character as my bag opener D:
---
You want to get full viper's with renegade runes, bursting sigil in offhand and 2 smoldering sigils in main hand weapons. 
---
When it comes to fractals, yes power is better but because of bursty nature of burning condition you can play condi firebrand even in T4's. It works also because your F1 Tome cooldown resets everytime you kill an enemy so you can stack very high amounts of AoE burning.
---
Nice, no worries, voted there.
---
I'm expecting an expansion to happen at SOME point, but for now they seem to know what they're doing, and if season 5 is going to have the level season 4 is having thus far, i'm not worried
---
Thank you, that's some pretty good advice
---
Idc. I don't really care about the story. I'd be fine with QoL and their normal content updates
---
This really warms my heart and brings a tear to my eye :')
---
Always love ANet and the GW2 team, and i always will.
---
&gt; I was mainly confused over the seemingly contradictory statements and concerned that anet didn't do more than a cursory glance before getting involved in something.
---
I think you only took a cursory glance at the website and then got confused yourself because you didnt get the context.
---
Yeah I gotta say, I was never part of the crew that demanded they renew their attention towards dungeons but with hindsight I wish they'd put resources to renovate them and bring new ones regularly instead of mounts but it makes business sense (easily monetizable) why something like mounts exist beyond their desire to design for movement.

I hope after HoT's gliding/bouncing mushrooms and PoF's mounts plus the various LS masteries, that Anet is past their focus on movement design. It feels like they've done it - what is there left to cover anyway? a bit of a rhetorical question - and maybe now they can give us more to chew on and this isn't to trash on those because I do enjoy them (as they've made the most enjoyable mounts in any game etc) but it's time to move on in my opinion.
---
Yeah, almost everyone is using mounts.  I came back to gw2 and did the farm without a mount and couldn't keep up.
---
Guardian can be good too depending on game mode and the role.
---
4Head
---
wtf ok
---
Is the only reliable source of mystic clovers the log in reward chest and fractal relic?
---
I get that this isn't the point but:  
---
Narratively speaking it makes snse. The Jungle is full of surviving pact troops rushing to trying the save the day working as a team. The deserts are empty and harsh, and even in the story the Commander is mostly alone.  
---
I also wonder whether the devs didn't want to people to leave HoT because that stuff would be impossible to solo, even with tweaking. One expansion for big group events, one for casual solo play.
---
Just get both, go for pve gear first and farm games be for wvw gear. In wvw u rly want minstrels
---
So you would advise I stick with Quickness Power Fb? I can see the point of that as that is what I'm currently running since I have power gear. It does fare well in open world since everything dies really fast with quickness + gs 2 or sw 2+3. Also in metas and fractals I tend to top dps but then again, its PUGS so, that tells a story in itself. 
---
And WvW, I guess looking at it the same way as scourges atm. Due to cleanses/quick deaths power would reign supreme..ofcourse not taking support builds into account in this situation.
---
Just another tip - If you like the elementalist staff playstyle, give a try to tempest instead of weaver. Weaver is much different in a lot of ways, and tempest is basically a elementalist 2.0.  Personally, I find tempest a lot more useful for pve and solo/openworld gameplay.
---
why not make trinkets +9 because those are more likely to be swapped to other characters ?
---
It's called RIBA now, everyone runs in a circle tagging every event, the end VW is a joke now, done so quickly then there is usually a commander that runs a chest train after VW. It's efficient, but imo it's not fun like old SW farming was.
---
I know how you feel but my skins are in game only, so are toys, and even for the gemstore stuff considering I exchange gold for gems I don't find it that unrewarding after all but yeah newcomers might
---
Also I tend to like gemstore more since I realized I'm supporting the devs by buying some.
---
We still lack some in game skin rewards tho
---
Hmm I would disagree actually. Tv ads are insanely expensive and arguably not very effective when a lot of young people don't watch tv or if they do, they just skip the ads.
---
Well, you kinda accused Anet of not doing their homework because you failed to find that quote on the charity website.
---
And the Kung Fu Tea Promotion was a completely different issue, so off topic.
---
Someone in chat says that Raiding is the way to make serious gold, is this true? How?
---
Heard someone refer to the mentor tag as a "hero tag" the other day? Why does that even mean.. Its heavily overused and rarely for its actual purpose
---
I find it funny because I'd say the community in general is at the opposite of that mindset completely. We are overly friendly so glad you jumped in finally! 
---
I'm sorry you got a bad experience in your young years tho :(
---
I do, but I never crafted blue/green weapons/armors. :P
---
If you go full Minstrel you wont do any noticeable amount of damage anymore. But even with Harrier stats the DPS wont be that much higher because you take support utilities and traits.
---
I would recommend you get both sets. Harrier for Fractals and Raids (cause you dont want to tank) and Minstrel for WvW (because you will really need the vitality and toughness there).
---
If you want to do dps but also be capable of supporting your teammates you can go for the Power Quickbrand in Fractals and the Condi Quickbrand in Raids (Power Quickbrand is in Raids also ok).
---
Yeah pretty much, all other weapons are pretty lackluster especially since you need to go in close range, staff is the most viable choice for ele.
---
Here’s some more advice: Try not to project a sense of inferiority. Your preoccupation with intelligence shows that you feel inadequate; You have something to prove. Intelligent people don’t talk about how intelligent they are. They demonstrate intelligence in their behavior. Speaking of which, you might want to avoid the word “intellect.” You used it earlier. That just screams “iamverysmart.” You wouldn’t want to come off as “fake.” I know how much you hate that. 
---
As for actual trolls, most of them are pretty easy to handle. The Mordremoth version is a little harder. You just have to stay ahead of the bees. Swiftness helps. Learning how to dodge can help too. If you’re having trouble with trolls, learn to identify them quickly and prioritize them in your target selection. With a little practice you’ll see that trolls aren’t the threat that you seem to feel think they are. It’s just a question of knowing how to handle them.
---
They insisted that season 5 will be a shake-up because anet doesn't like the fact that we think episodes are becoming stale.
---
So wait and see!
---
BTW: Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, Bruce Willis is a ghost in The Sixth Sense, Ned Stark gets beheaded in episode 9, Planet of the Apes is actually Earth in the future, and you kill Trahearne at the end of HoT.
---
Well, first of all, every raid wing grants you somewhere between 6 to 10 gold in cash. If you do 4 raid wings a week, that's surely about 30 gold. If you are good and get a good group, this will take you no longer than 3 hours or so.
---
That's quite nice, right? And this is excluding all the ascended drops you'll get (which don't convert into gold, sure, but still have value). Oh, and occasionally you get drops worth 100 gold.
---
If one is stealthed, is it possible for hostile player to see fields dropped by the one invisible?
---
Maybe they were the illusion all along
---
Quick maths that
---
I see. That is a real shame. ): But thanks for your reply!
---
Raiding is only competitive with other gold farms if you clear pretty quickly. You do however get Magnetite shards, which are a great way to get ascended gear.
---
Hi , new player here. If i buy both expansions will i get two lvl 80 boosters?   
---
Even tho im leveling my class solo to 80 first.
---
Does the GW1 community have same reputation ?
---
Yeah true, just saying barely spent much on it this time XD
---
It's an old organisation that was initially for the Latino community. They're not going to change their name because 20 people on Reddit cannot understand that as far as helping people go, a sudden change of the brand isn't going to help anyone. 
---
Your post is honestly infuriating. Your irresponsible emphasis on reducing the movement or organisation to something less than for being 'political' and 'nebulous' is ridiculous. If you can for just one second forget what you've heard your favorite Youtuber say about social justice and its effects on the lives of people, can you just relate to how Anet is inviting the community to emphasize with those less fortunate than us? 
---
"(...) however imperfectly expressed", give me a fucking break.
---
I do that often as well but didn't thought of being that specific. Thanks for the tip.
---
Minstrel in fractals should be fine. There is no tanking mechanic and you can face tank more and learn the mechanics.
---
But keep one thing in mind: don't get used to facetanking. Because when you switch to a DPS firebrand later on you will get significantly more damage from everything. So try to avoid as much as you can, even when you have enough HP to tank it.
---
Ultimately you bullied yourself by not trying it. GW1 was great as well and I can say that if you did, you could have one more friend back then, rather than bully. Maybe. 
---
Anyways, welcome :) Have in mind that here nothing will hold your hands and you will need to make your own way through stuff. The game jsut throws a bit of hints, but it has to be you who setups goals :) So if you ever be lost what to do...Just go for what you liked. Or....sometimes works to just go through LFG and join random group that catches your eye...
---
Hey, that's Quality shitposting!
---
Good bot.
---
I agreed with Daredevil Staff. I use it all the time, spec with Crit damage heals you , plus that heal skill that heals you when you damage enemies, and i just jump right into the middle of enemies. Lots of fun.
---
A +13 agony infusion will give you 19.5 precision, while a +9AR/+5precision infusion will only give you 18.5.
---
These days sort of.  It varies because only people that really love the game and often hate GW2 remain.  It was known for having a friendly community in the past and it's easy to get help via all sorts of guilds, the discord or reddit.  Mentioning GW2 tends to spark tons of drama because people feel betrayed by the huge shift in the skill system and gameplay.
---
How I felt after obtaining the griffon, was down to literally 50 silver.
---
I have both, but like mace is better for wvw.
---
Huh. Looks like your bully took the wrong lessons from the personal story. I bet he thought Mazdak did nothing wrong.
---
Oh, just saw your edit too. If you're looking for magic find food then [omnomberry cream](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tray_of_Chocolate_Omnomberry_Creams) is a great choice, they give the most magic find of any food (though it is conditional). [Lotus fries](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Feast_of_Lotus_Fries) are a cheap alternative too (though [pumpkin cookies](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spicy_Pumpkin_Cookie) sell for nothing on the TP and are a better version). [Omnomberry bars](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tray_of_Omnomberry_Bars) also work but the gold find isn't usually that impactful on open world stuff.
---
Cheers \^\^

Ranger has solid builds everywhere except large scale wvw. Mesmer has solid builds everywhere but can be demanding yet boring st times. Both are defo a good option for pve / pvp focus. Guard is solid in all three modes but through vastly different play styles and builds between modes. You will need different sets of gear. 
---
Also outside of condi raid bosses engi is in a pretty good spot. Solid pvp, wvw and pve between holo and scrapper.
---
Thanks :D
---
I have the armor boxes lying around so it's just a matter of which stat set to take ;)
---
Offline ads the UK? So cool :D
---
Same is true for guard. You won't play dh on every boss, so still need alternatives.
---
They told you to go sb because it used to be / is quite easy to learn while having very very good performance for its effort. As entry into raids sb3 and DH are great classes.
---
So you just completely drop regen then.  That sounds pretty risky tbh.  But whatever works for you.
---
But but but what if you need it for a new character or might need it one day!!
---
I am optimistic about the 3rd expac, too. So far we had season (1 +) 2 setting up the story for HoT and season 3 setting it up for PoF. But atm we have season 4 to finish Storyarchs from PoF, so we will need (at least) season 5 to get us into the next expac and if would be ridiculous to talk about it over a year in advance. Especially if you can't talk about the most of it without potentially spoilering the season leading up to it.
---
The Bitter Cold would be great if it was what it was (seemingly) designed for: a highly rewarding daily loot room. The idea would be that every day you would do the potion crafting so you could gain access to the Bitter Cold which either had mobs that had great drops or was otherwise full of chests you could open. The whole area has a very Vinewrath feel to it, which makes it baffling to me that they never implemented it. Huge sections of that map are never used for anything but story instances and it would be fantastic to see them go through and improve it one day.
---
I admire your perspective skills :D
---
Moral of the story: don't judge things only because it's used by someone you don't like.
---
Weaver is elementalist 2.0. Takes the core concepts of ele and pushes them further.
---
Tempest is elementalist noobproof edition. Takes the core concepts of ele and simplifies them to make the spec easier to get into, but with less depth.
---
If hybrid builds were more common, maybe tempest would get more involvement. Currently most builds will spam overload certain overloads to avoid more depth in attunement management.
---
There's nothing "fake" about my intellectual superiority over you.
---
I feel you. I'm trying to craft my first legendary and juggle school and work. My playtime is limited. So I feel like I always have less than a gold because I spend it on crafting shit so often.
---
Realise that no matter how well you do it will never be good enough for some people, develop a substance abuse problem, upkeep at least 80 alac 90 quickness and occasionally mash f4
---
&gt;So you would advise I stick with Quickness Power Fb?
---
For Fractals defenitly yes
---
&gt;Ofcourse not quite as high dps as core/dh
---
You Play a Support build not a DPS build ofc you do less dps
---
&gt;And WvW \[...\] Due to cleanses/quick deaths power would reign supreme
---
No even Scourges are playing Power atm (so power dmg isn't a surpreme at all) and doing that Job way better than the FB could.  
---
Pls don't bring that Build to WvW. As yourself stated in your original Post get minstrel Gear for that.
---
Oh shit! Yeah definetly, thanks mate
---
most people who've played the game longer than a few months have more than 1 character since the meta changes fairly quickly for the different gametypes. Currently i have my guardian built for wvw, my warrior for raids, and my thief for fractals. then i've got a couple other classes i use for various open world events. 
---
it is way easier to manage your bags when you don't have multiple gearsets on one character.
---
Really simple suggestion I've advocated for a while. Keeping in mind that I'm ignorant of development issues and this is likely "simple" in my own mind (it's just two lines of code, guiz).
---
Increase event density. Look at most new maps and the problem becomes really evident really fast: events aren't there. Someone with more time on their hands would have to run the numbers, but it feels like new maps have the same number of events as, say, Caledon Forest. The problem is that they're stretched over a huge area AND/OR they take a really long time to reset/start again. This means that a lot of places are big empty stretches of nothing but maybe some pretty scenery. The devs have put things like cool NPCs or events with long respawn timers, but people aren't seeing them because they're no longer encouraged to look for events.
---
Thunderhead Peaks is one of the worst for this. Name five events that aren't the two metas. The most I can think of is the one near the forge where Rytlock, Canach, and Logan are doing troop movements. Even IF there are more (and I'm pretty confident there aren't) the fact that I don't know about them despite spending a good amount of time in the map is pretty sad.
---
I think the things holding this back is that events take a lot of coding (getting NPCs to walk to locations, trigger dialogue that costs VA money, etc.) but I think they're worth it because they're one of the best ways of creating repeatable content. There is nothing better than going to a map where you think you've seen everything and then this person comes up to you and says "HEY, DO YOU WANT TO HELP ME SUMMON A DEMON?!"
---
As someone who's in the industry, I can tell you that crunch time is a bitch, like really. Working 3-5 months straight of 12-15 hour days, with only 1 day off a week, it's horrible, work gets messy cause everyone is tired, and attention to detail goes out the window.
---
Staff is pretty good on mesmer if you switch to mirage, lets you solo all kinds of hard content.
---
But almost right after what you quoted they stated also no one had ever suggested not working overtime could reflect badly against you, or prevent you for being considered for promotions/bonuses...
---
Yes.  
---
However, don't draw any real, meaningful conclusions from T1 Fractals.  Groups tend to take more damage when more dangerous instabilities are introduced in T2 (Mai Trin, Twilight Oasis, Siren's Reef, Nightmare, S.Observatory), T3 &amp; T4.  There's a lot of damage that feels "unavoidable," at first until you learn to utilize the better strategies utilizing blinds, pulls, life steal, interrupts, cc and get practice dodging. 
---
There are plenty of options for running dedicated or "side"-healers these days.  The sorts of volatile instabilities like afflicted, we bleed fire, stick together, outflanked, boon-overload and adrenaline rush will create lots of spikes in damage.  For example, the Dwayna phase in the Reaper Amala fight in Twilight Oasis procs afflicted in rapid succession.  However, much of that can be avoided without a healer too.  Having a healer can be a good buffer until people learn the telegraphs.  
---
Unfortunately, in T1 I'd say running some sort of hybrid-support is going to be more useful than a dedicated support.  I'd say this logic carries through T2 in 25-50 too.  In T3 &amp; T4 while you don't technically "need" a healer it's more of a quality of life thing.  Healers aren't meta in groups that surpass certain damage thresholds utilizing very bursty classes like DH, Weaver, Soulbeast, Holo (etc).  
---
The reason for that is because bosses phase in very short time-frames.  When you have 2-3 people doing 20-30k+ burst DPS the bosses barely get to attack before they phase in no more than 10-15s with a solid group.  Every bit of damage counts towards hitting this sort of threshold.  Back before the Chrono nerfs the group I was playing with would do 4 DPS &amp; 1 Minstrel's Chrono for CMs &amp; T4s.  These days that's shifted to Firebrand/Renegade + Warrior &amp; 2 bursty pDPS like Soulbeast or DH.  
---
I think that if you want to run a slightly more DPS oriented druid then you could definitely do that for T1 &amp; T2.  Once you enter T3 you may want to swap back to more support oriented class or healer.  Multiple active instabilities like boon-overload + outflanked can result in some very nasty, random damage spikes when mobs aren't handled immaculately.  That dredge veteran behind you?  Ouch.  
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Druid_-_Boon_Support_Condi_DPS
---
Something like this might work okay for T1 &amp; T2.  However, chances are your group will probably need extra healing once you all start dealing with multiple instabilities. If you want to use Staff + Axe/Warhorn for your dedicated support you can totally keep doing that, but T1 &amp; T2 have pretty minimal damage pressure -- you're not going to be doing much healing. 
---
I think there's a certain amount of wisdom and knowledge that comes from having ArcDPS handy.  I think what you'll find is that 
---
* T1 Fractals - designed for about 0-5k DPS
---
* T2 Fractals - designed for about 5-10k DPS
---
* T3 Fractals - designed for about 10-15k DPS
---
* T4 Fractals - designed for about 15-20k+ DPS
---
So while you might be hitting early thresholds early on there's definitely a curve.  Lacking DPS will put more pressure on your group to mechanically master Fractals up towards T3 (50-75) especially.  HP, armor &amp; toughness scaling pick up a bit towards T3 meaning that the damage curve gradually heightens.  So, if people don't improve much between T2 &amp; T3 then yeah, you'll be doing more healing than you ever asked for. 
---
... and it may not be enough.  There's a certain amount of individual survivability that's required to thrive in T3 &amp; T4.  It's not a bad thing to be lacking DPS or being slightly behind the DPS curve, but it puts more pressure on people to learn the mechanics.
---
Some bags go on lvl 49 alt, other bags are just opened, [salvaged], and stored in material storage; Once you need to craft stuff, you will not need to buy stuff. Sell once the storage is full, gold is just a way to store stuff that does not fit.
---
If you want to get gold out of it the [holo cheese](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Holographic_Super_Cheese) and [drumstick](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Holographic_Super_Drumstick) should eventually climb back up to 1g once the supply runs low again.
---
I've never agreed with the LW map hate and find the "x hours of playtime" to usually be bullshit. That said, I struggle to see the weapons and armor sets as things that make the content "last". Thunderhead is shit, not because it doesn't have weapons I can go for, but because the weapons are locked behind a currency I can only get doing two event chains that are identical every... single... time... Jesus kill me now.
---
LW map spam is the definition of quantity over quality. Gandara is like the poster child of rushed content.
---
It is really bad for the games future. ANET and also quite a few of the players seem oblivious to how the living world isn't working. Sure it is fine as filler content between expansions, but it isn't a replacement for expansions/DLC.
---
This quarters revenue report will be out ina  few weeks. There is a decent chance revenue falls below Aion. Or at least if no expansions are released it may track lower than Aion. That should be a wake up call that they need to change direction.
---
If they are going all in on the living world and there isn't an expansion any time soon, then LWS5 had better be revolutionary. If it is more of the same, then it doesn't look good.
---
I'm talking about material bags NOT loot bags.
---
EU hasn't produced many new pugmanders in years. The old ones continue to quit.
---
Go on any server and lead open for anyone to follow and you'll have 50 man queues within 2 weeks, as long as you win fights. If you lose fights you'll still have queues but half the map will afk on most pug dominant servers. 
---
Popular comms can go literally any server or map and hundreds of pugs will follow. While telling the comm how he should lead and be more welcoming to even more players, and not listening to even the most basic requests.
---
This just makes pugmanders not bother with them, which makes the entitled puglet problem worse.
---
A half decent comm can tag any point in prime and get a 50 man grp on any map but eb, in eb itll be a 50 man queue instead. Despite kicking rangers and even if they're toxic.
---
A bad comm who is nice and allows anythin is followed until they wipe 3 times. Then they have less than 5 players.
---
The truth is even the puglets demanding to do whatever rather wjn than play with nice, friendly less skilled people. And simply nicely asking them anything doesn't work, in fact you'll get flamed for it.
---
No surprise we learn more and more starts to get rid of pugs. Hop some maps, hide that tag, tank some siege and get them killed. You ask them to go tanky they wont listen. You tank 2 acs and they're dead on the floor blaming you...
---
The supply of retarded entitled pugs is infinite, yet they're all like U NEED ME IN WVW REEEEE. No, I dont. Theres literally a waiting line of 50 players willing to replace you.
---
no no. many people steals with purpose and using invoke lightning.( LH Skill 4). and your rotation is corrupting
---
I used to main Mesmer in GW1. God it was so much fun being able to completely shutdown enemy casters and punish them for spamming skills.
---
I couldn't get into GW2 mesmer. It's basically a completely different profession.
---
I'm not sure about you, but on EU I see quite a balance of groups asking for Chrono/Druid or FB/Ren now. 
---
If we're talking about the absolute top-end hardcore players, then yeah, they're right, Druid hasn't been meta for fractals in like a year now. Not a bad choice by any means, and a good pug class, since so many are used to playing with it, but it's entirely possible it may get increasingly unpopular for fractals.
---
Deleting all characters was not a good idea...

You should have gotten the unlock in your wardrobe. As a piece of armor or as a costume

---
It'd be hella cool if there's a new race tho, I'll take Tengu if not Kodan.

Only play with people you trust and never with thieves!

That box was most likely a birthday gift for the individual character itself.

We all need a little vodka in our life. Or a lot uwu.
---
Also idk how to crosspost it x'D
---
sometimes you need to open lfg and do raids with pugs :)
---
Well, they get sold for that price only because they are profitable at it. If you open them you wil lnot get only the cheapest material, but also the expensive ones, so on average you will get what market already offers. 
---
Unless you sell on some temporary surge of prices. But no sane person would buy bag if it would be overpriced, to just lose gold. 
---
So all you do when you sell is that you play safe card, getting rid of the random, and getting average profit. Minus market tax.
---
Thanks! I might do Claw of Koda next, just to warm up a bit more :)
---
Then you van make the dailis im PvP.

That armor is the Luminous armor. It’s given to first character in your account to celebrate their sixth birthday. You won’t ever receive that set of items anymore, but the skin will have been unlocked for use on all your characters. All you’re missing out on are some Exotic-tier armor, which is easy enough to get.

or you can not be a little bitch and not do that. since its legal and such  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I just finished chapter six earlier this week and now I realize the name of this bot ;_;
---
Oooh, yeah. 
---
Well, hopefully I won't need that tip again.
---
I'm not so sure. My group has tried FB Tank on VG and it didn't really seem to go as well as Chrono tanking. Same for Xera. Bosses like Gorseval and KC it doesn't really seem to matter, since anyone can tank KC as long as they know how to position themselves correctly (150 free toughness on Soulbeast that can't be changed is fun). Deimos I suppose FB might have the advantage with probably better access to Aegis?
---
i'm not giving them back

Regarding the division of Zhaitan's and Mordremoth's magic, the magic is shown / suggested (suggested for Z, shown for M) to flow along the leylines rather than directly to the other Elder Dragons. As such, nothing really suggests the DSD got any magic.
---
That said, see in the HoT finale that Mordremoth's magic heads in four primary directions, and from there snaked along ley lines. Primordus got so much because he went to where 1/4th of the magic went to (Ring of Fire), while another 1/4th went north to Tarir and the Maguuma Bloodstone, and the other half split towards east (ultimately to Kralkatorrik) and west.
---
Also, we do know that distance is a factor as it was brought up in A Crack in the ice for why Jormag has so little Mordy or Zhaitan magic. Similarly, Kralkatorrik seems to have little Mordremoth magic, and more Zhaitan.
---
This would suggest 3/4 way splits, more or less, for both Zhaitan and Mordremoth.
---
For Zhaitan:
---
* One portion went north to Tequatl and LA (that then got redirected to Mordremoth). Some no doubt also going into the Bloodstone Caves bloodstone.
---
* One portion went east to Kralkatorrik (possibly Vlast too but we have no way to tell).
---
* One portion went west to either Mordremoth or the Ring of Fire (or both), some no doubt going into the Ring of Fire bloodstone too.
---
* There might be more, but we currently have no real implication for such occurring.
---
For Mordremoth:
---
* One portion went north to Aurene and the Bloodstone.
---
* One portion went south to Ring of Fire (some no doubt going into the Bloodstone there).
---
* One portion went east, eventually towards Kralkatorrik (would have hit the Pale Tree along the way, possibly Bloodstone Caves bloodstone, though how much went into them is unclear).
---
* One portion went west, into the unknown sea (maybe to DSD?).
---
Beyond those large portions, smaller portions spread out like veins from those main paths, including towards the Maguuma Bloodstone (specifically for Zhaitan), and Jormag. While it's likely the DSD got some of both, that amount would no doubt be small due to distance and direction.
---
Either way, the magic flowed alone ley lines, and not directly into dragons.
---
Feels sad man

It's not explicitly stated, but it is shown. There's two points it's shown, mainly in relating that Balthazar's magic was in Aurene, but now it's not. One of the two places you actually quoted:
---
*The warmth of Balthazar's spirit is now just cold, lifeless crystal.*
---
The other comes much later, but is basically just rewording that line. What was Balthazar inside Aurene (which was his magic) is now gone, missing.
---
Took a few minutes but I found the dumbest post in the sub.

For today.

In my group we play with hybrid quickbrand and healer rene, but sometimes we just both switch to healers if there is something like frailty + wbf/affliction/flanking in a difficult fractal.

yeah there are plenty of ways to make decent gold to around 100-300g per day with maybe 1 hour of work
---
&gt; You don't have time to watch youtube videos, you wan't to learn it in the encounter? Fine. But why the fuck is it elitism if people who already know the bosses don't want do spend their time learning the encounter with you?
---
The game should have ING-GAME mechanics to teach how to raid in their RAIDs, teaching you the mechanics of encounters.
---
You should not have to go to fucking YT for that.
---
Yeah I need to add much more retro music in general to my playlist, FFX has gone some good ones for sure!
---
Unfortunately this might be the last one this year, I'm at work probably until the event ends. If ArenaNet made an offline version for speedrunning I'd probably run it often! You can look on my twitch for my recorded runs for a bit longer, I'll probably remove them sometime soon.
---
HOWEVER, I'll definitely be doing this again next time SAB is around! So keep me in mind :D
---
This is the more apt distribution. It makes having the proper weapon sets that you'll need cheaper to apply AR to.
---
Once you start getting agony impedance augmentations and ascended visual auras (which have +9 AR), it kinda becomes a mess. But I suppose you're probably not a beginner at that point.
---
Burn fb got heavily nerfed by removal of burn on block. 
---
Being more useful than rangers isn't really a high bar.
---
Plz inform comm you're not actually healing because your party will likely die repeatedly.
---
I play quite a few different fb builds and use viper far more than grieving and sinister. However being able to swap runes is kinda needed for me. (E.g. monk renegade and firebrand runes are all common)
---
Just did! Thank you so much
---
I am currently playing a power DH and would like someone to check on DPS numbers to see if they’re okay, I am doing this so I can better improve my DH rotation. 
---
I currently deal around 10k+ dps according to arcdps during fractal encounters, this damage is obtained without the help of food or utility and mostly with self provided boons such as retaliation and might, when there are chrono or other form of support I can push up to 20k+ dps. I don’t have an ascended back and amulet, getting them soon. Is this dps alright for T2 fractals and above? Asking this so I can improve on my rotation, thanks in advance :)
---
and everytime we kiss I swear I can fly
---
Random build FB is better than ranger/ thief, but you could also go buy exotic magi gear for 20g and be way more effective in the support role. I think you'd be better off running DH with a burn build, you get the range you need plus don't get flamed for not being support FB. Burn FB is not that great, especially where people are running into melee with it. You won't get much damage off, provide limited utility and most likely will plank terribly if you're taking up the spot of the support FB.
---
There is a lot of marketing that goes into the gem-store and they do things the way they do them for particular reasons. Scarcity tends to increase demand because people seem to fear that items won’t be back for a long time. 
---
There’s some psychology involved and I don’t know the science behind it, but I know it’s been studied.
---
This is really cool. I stumbled upon the voice of koda in Snowden Drifts. Really interesting to hear the lore and how the Koda operate.
---
Build a legendary, unique item, or get the Griffon. You'll be peddling for every copper in no time.
---
I think it's more the over adbundance of trenchcoats rather than the trenchcoats themselves.
---
Mixed feelings about elite specs because they make long term gameplay worse and harder to balance. But atleast they shake up gameplay and meta for abit. Something their balance patches rarely matter.
---
Expects ignore pvp, wvw and raids so outside of elite specs expansions are pretty irrelevant for me.
---
Finally someone aknowledging  the superiority of tempest
---
Ofc it is possible to save gold to buy it from the tp, it just takes more time. Just save the gold to craft it yourself. Also farm volatile magic and convert it to trophy shipment for the gift of fortune, you will end up spending 1/3 of the initial price on it.
---
The reason tempests don't use every overload is not because people are too dumb to manage more than two keybinds, it's because there is literally zero reason why you would want to use a situational ability in a situation that does not call for it, and water overload is situational while earth overload (and the rest of earth attunement) is just gimped.
---
I wish I could get Viper's :(
---
I am running with the Carrion alternative suggested by MetaBattle
---
&gt; If they introduce proper difficulty modes, most veterans will be playing the game again on a constant basis.
---
I disagree with this statement.
---
&gt; Which option do you like more?
---
Considering they're both equivalent in result, well ...
---
I can't...I tried. The joke was wrong and bad.
---
I am free to play atm but I plan on buying the xpacs do you play league aswell just assuming cuz your name is vayne xD
---
#QueensdaleChampionTrain2k19
---
What about legendary backpacks?
---
There's a story behind it, mobs to kill, NPC's to talk with and eventually a not-so-trivial-but-soloable miniboss at the end (on in the middle of it).
---
I dont see a big difference except the part where you dont have thousands of useless mobs.
---
Flipping fast moving items and doing midterm investments, it's really not that hard to do.
---
Everyone can at least do low-value flipping, if you lower budget, with still give good ROI rates, since most bot and TP barons don't invest there.
---
The culture you're describing sounds incredible to be a part of. Have you found it elsewhere in GW2? If so, do you mind me asking where?
---
Thief is probably the most unique class in the game with its initiative system. It's really fast paced and full of cool flippy animations and clank dagger sounds.
---
Guardian is probaby the most diverse class filling power, support, and condi roles either really well or tolerably well in every game mode. 
---
Tbh, pick whichever one has the coolest looking armor for your human female. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Human_female_medium_armor Play this game for long enough and you'll have 3 80's of every class eventually
---
Well said.
---
What about rare loot drops from a dungeon boss? Working with mutliple people to clear the dungeon? Story instances are NOWHERE near the same aa dungeons lets be real here.
---
&gt; Why was this a failed abandoned feature?
---
They realized that a dungeon required a lot of work and not that many people were actually doing them. Everybody ignores the fact that Arenanet tracks data showing exactly how players interact with the game and exactly which content is actually being played. Arenanet puts their resources into the content that's being played by the greatest number of people.
---
No ones ever really gone
---
We should reduce the TP fees for people who are rich.  This will help poor people. /s
---
Sage advice my friend
---
I really wish they would re-visit dungeons to change the scaling in a way that armor and level dont matter. Then we could just label them leveling dungeons and be done with the topic.
---
True.
---
Play around with different classes! I got like 4 different characters to 30 before I committed to getting my ranger to 80 first. Even then, I ended up maining guardian afterward. There's so much to learn in the game so take it at your own pace!
---
Too bad fractals are mainly only done at max level. Why cant they make early- mid game dungeons relevant again? They did it to earlier starting maps making higher level characters to visit the area once again.
---
Yeah.. no.
---
Depends on class tbh, high AR is really good on chrono cause you make use of both the precision and the concentration and can run more zerk gear/power&amp;fero food etc while still being at 100% crit
---
Daily fractals is an excellent and fun way to make good. 
---
Also don’t forget to do dailies for an easy 2g. 
---
Sell things in your material storage you won’t be using.
---
In that case: Fractals
---
You get loot from new map. You get to kill dragons in story and no one stops you from bringing friends. There's nothing rare about dungeon drops anyway.
---
LS3e5's instances are practically an additional path of CM dungeon.
---
Play the game.
---
There, literally, was an attempt.
---
Scaling down still doesn't help when you have five people doing it each spawn.
---
I tried Discretize rotation but pug groups can’t seem to burst bosses or champion / elite mobs down to their invulnerable state or to death before the repeat phase of my rotation occurs, and the repeat phase for Discretize DH rotation is pretty weird since you need won’t be able to cast 2 sword of justice during the second repeat rotation phase due to cooldown, but maybe it’s just that I’m doing it wrongly.
---
The story instances aren’t even CLOSE to the fun and replayability of dungeons.
---
Weaver : the only class where people can run off with yur DPS in their hands.
---
No, they're not. That's why the teams working on raids are much smaller than the teams working on Living World.
---
AITA if I steal conjure to pad my own dps
---
Literally everything youve mentioned has nothing to do with typical dungeons. Glad to see this conversation isnt going anywhere
---
Indeed. They should have merged the concept of dungeons and story and do both instead discontinuin dungeons, like in the Eye of the North Expansion:
---
* Play story once, unlock dungeon mode and CMs.
---
Story mode: Scaling for 1-5 players. Much easier to solo.  One time rewards.
---
Dungeon mode aka Explorable paths: Unlocked for the longer dungeon-like instances with boss encounters. No scaling. Meant for 5 players. Repeatable rewards in a long cycle, like 3 months or so, so people have time to do all the different dungeons.  
---
Explorable paths don't have to be 3 different new paths like in the current dungeons, they could just be a repeat of the story with tweaks to make it more challenging and work better with more roles other than just pure dps. 
---
Then the current 8 dungeons would be properly inserted into the personal story instead being optional.  
---
They could also make the explorable paths unlocked for the account instead for the character.
---
Eh.
---
na if you know the proper ways to make gold you can effort most stuff in less then a week, even if you can just play 1-3 hours a day
---
Keep in mind, Anet went through a company wide restructure, so hopefully PvP will get a bit more love.
---
Why does it matter how it's called when the content is basically the same? You even have achievements so it's somewhat repeatable. Open world is open content, dungeons are instanced content, there's no similarities.
---
Fractals arent dungeons because they are called fractals. People dont like meta because the name brings bad reputation for some reason. They dont like fetch quests in other MMO's, but hearts are different because they are called hearts... Stop labeling things and you'll have easier time in your life.
---
I mean, botting/afk farming isn’t actually ok, but you can’t know if someone else is and they aren’t required to respond to you at all if you message them anyway.
---
Honestly, i used to really try to advocate for chrono balance in pve..
---
At this point with fb comps being debatably better for non speed clear groups and said groups still refusing to try other comps i see no point to further chrono balance because i do not believe its what the majority community wants. 
---
At this point it might be better to just say fuck it and bring back the 11 boon meta (i don't want this I've just given up).
---
cute
---
Trahearne Down Economics
---
Work your way up to CM fractals and do T4s every day, do a full raid clear every week, do daily meta events like Tarrir and Chaac Gerent, silverwaste dark in your downtime. If you keep this pace for a few weeks you’ll be rolling in cash. The biggest obstacle to making money in GW2 is people not being willing to commit to consistently farming.
---
The real issue was them having trouble getting the existing dungeons to the difficulty level they wanted but to the community continuously finding stack points, path skips, exploits etc. A lot of work never getting the desired results.
---
That's too much money, better nerf whatever you were farming so you can spend real money on gold instead.
---
Hi PvP, I’m Dad. 
---
No but seriously this is how I do dailies anyway. So easy.
---
The spread of nocturnal merchants is abysmal
---
Weaver my effect is from core ele skills (well except sword). My dmg comes from all the core ele skills, and a tiny bit dual skills. Stances interact with my attunements.
---
Tempest you're using less ele skills and less attunements, replacing those with overloads that are very strong. Heal tempest gets a nice chunk of healing from overload. Condi tempest the same. FA tempest too. The shouts are inspired by attunements but outside of rebound dont interact with attunements. A little now due to the aura active effects.
---
Attunement management was a core part of ele. Tempest dumbed it down to make the class casual friendly. Weaver doubled down on it, allowing people that rotated core ele skills well to do even more with the class. People that dont find themselves locked out of skills for 4 seconds.
---
Don’t be this guy. Earn your own way, don’t start begging.
---
LWS3, PoF, and LWS4 definitely lack the replayability of HoT.
---
Many instances repeatable for achievements work like this too, without repeatable rewards.
---
A lot of wasted content that too many players may play only once. Players repeated GW missions and Eye of the North dungeons a lot after doing the stories. We could have some of that in GW2 too.
---
If everyone telld everyone what they flip then no one can flip.
---
Exactly. I'm just amazed people are still trying to change the optimal setup for this.
---
Ah, my bad then. Based on your previous reply it came off as snarky. Hard to convey emotions over text so I just missread yours, sorry.
---
I'm there with GW2.  All that's left for me is the content I don't like (PVP, WvW, raids, LWS2 achievements) and whatever the next LW episode brings.
---
I did just upload one. 37:52 time spent in maps loading screens counted into that. Stopped timer when king toad chest appeared. And started again at 1st movement at w2z1
---
That's the mindset I used to have, but then I wanted to make a legendary when it first released and had to buy everything at 2 or 3 times the prices I sold them at. I'm a hoarder now.
---
I enjoyed mounts up to Petey, but when the Warclaw was announced something snapped in the back of my head and that's when I quit logging in for daily chores.  Fractals... Deepstone and Twilight Oasis are fun, particularly t2/t3.
---
True, I just meant gameplay wise they are not remotely similar. A lot of people that love GW1 were looking for that same type of gameplay in GW2. Personally I wasn't, I still play both and I much prefer the gameplay of GW2, but there are a lot of people that love and prefer the gameplay style of the first game. GW1 really is fairly unique in it's gameplay style and to my knowledge there are no games out there that do that kind of gameplay as well. I don't share the same prefferences as the people that prefer GW1 over GW2 but I definitely can see where they're coming from when the say that they would love a true [gameplay] successor to GW1.
---
I mean don’t get me wrong, I love farming. I will gather mats a lot while watching a movie or something but glu just gotta be smart.
---
Check the guides section on the sidebar, there are fractal guides there although a bit outdated https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/guides#wiki_fractals_of_the_mists_guides.
---
Generally, go to the fractal portal in LA-Fort Mariner, press Y, open the LFG panel and check the fractal section. To survive in fractals after fractal level 20 you need agony resistance, which you get by equipping agony infusions (they are an upgrade component, similar to runes or sigils) in your ascended gear ( only ascended). Higher levels have harder mechanics, require more agony resistance, have more instabilities (randomized mechanics that usually have a positive and negative component) and provide better rewards.
---
You start with a fractal level (1) and completing higher level fractals than your level increases your level by one(so if the first fractal you do is 10, for example, your level will increase to 2, not 10). In order to select a level at the portal you must have at least same or higher fractal level, or be in the same group with someone who has.
---
You can check https://discretize.eu/ for high end guides and builds to aim for, but your experience when starting out won't be anything like that. There's really a ton of information to go around, too much to include in one comment, so feel free to ask more but also use the search function here and on google/youtube for more guides.
---
Good luck!
---
Quite bad run, had 2 deaths. Costing me like 1 minute. And didn't get wizard in 1 phase wasting another minute. And some ppl may be confused with the start of w2z2 looking like there is a cut. But that is in fact not the case with w2z2. If you /gg at the end of any zone you respawn to the next one without the cut scene. On every other zone you still can't move until the cutscene would be over on w2z2 you can for some weird reason, but it teleports you back to the start after the cut scene would be over.
---
Yeah I did the pyramid elemental guy for the griffen collection, it was fine lol
---
And also a reason why raids are a waste of resources until Anet finally stops living in 2006 anf starts adding additional modes to their dungeons, so a broader audiance plays them, so they stop being niche content for a negligible amount of people.
---
TL;DR Raids are fucking fantastic, stop wasting them on &lt;10% of players!
---
Even if you are playing it not well it is still free cash, i am new at this and not playing it well but i made ~200g casually flipping items in WvW accessing the TP whenever i died over 2 days. Not that good for the time i played but still free cash.
---
They’re serious about nursing their Chinese fanbase
---
Nice
---
Uncertain. - Until we see where Season 5 takes us, and what type of content it brings, I can't say for sure if it'll be better than getting an expansion after S4 or not. I really just wish we could get releases a bit quicker than we have been, but with layoffs I really just see them being pushed back further, at least for a while.
---
Well the Chinese business model is all about milking money from gamers for all the good stuff we grind for..
---
I saw your upload. I'm both jealous and happy for you! That's WR as far as I know, right?
---
had we seen that kid before?
---
I dont recall.
---
Do just that, run around and explore at your own pace. If you know of a "secret" JP or a cool obscure area, lead them to it and let th figure it out on their own from there.
---
Thank you so much for this one!
---
Fight with Mouth of Mordremoth.
---
Rata Sum.
---
Fractal Lobby (do JP there as well).
---
Fractals in general.
---
Please tell me how did you do that at 0:55.
---
I've decided to try to complete my green collection from World 1, but I couldn't even get past that **** stone this year.
---
Anet's marketing team really did an outstanding job with their E-Sports tournament.  I'd like to know which team this kid was playing for.
---
&gt; look closely
---
It really does make timing some segments a lot easier. In first person you can see the subtle dip your character makes when they go over a ledge, so it is easier for me to time some of the more difficult dodgejumps. It also eliminates distractions and allows you to make some turns easier. 
---
I only go out of FP during segments where you need to be able to see surroundings (The darker areas of W2Z3, the goat puzzle in W2Z3, etc)
---
Portaling my first character into Hoelbrek and running to the Frozen Maw meta made a big impression on me when I started playing in 2018. Even though I spent most of the time Defeated, seeing fifty players or more working together was cool. Then I looked at the wiki Events Timer and realized : bosses every 15 minutes, loot for little effort, people show up to cooperate. It made a big (good) impression.
---
I left before they added ascended...oy.  time to read up tonight
---
This is why we need e-sport back
---
Which crevasse did you pull this out from? Ass or mouth?
---
Because if that were true, we'd more than likely get way more than 1 wing per year.
---
I'm not talking about the logo.
---
Hey if this ad campaign is the start of a Guild Wars Wrath/Cata era, I FULLY WELCOME IT. Wrath was the best season of WoW hands down.
---
No, I mentioned some other instances in other comments. Nearly all ls4 episodes have at least 1 instance that resembles dungeon content.
---
\- Save money and buy some +7s instead of +9s
---
\- burn a stack of ectos to infuse a backpack.
---
Pls
---
Just enter the PvP lobby. Free of cost and will teleport you right back to where you were before. :)
---
Ooh, I was under the impression there wasn't that many running. How many more people are running do you know of? And bloody hell, am I even in the top 3? xD
---
To be honest, if you had exotic gear you're pretty much ok for most encounters. Ascended gear is a noticeable but often unnecessary stat boost for clearing content. The only time you absolutely need it is in high tier fractals (end game mini dungeons effectively), which has a mechanic (agony) which will kill you without ascended gear (which can equip agony resistance)
---
 Dont use your wow experience to try to help you in this game, they have barely any similarities.
---
Raids really aren't that hard. By repeating the idea that raids need an easy most to be accessible you're gatekeeping yourself and others out of fun content which yes has somewhat of a learning curve and yeah that's a little scary because you might mess up and fail but there are enough training groups and discords out there that are willing to teach and be patient with any number of new raiders. Really the majority of the bosses can be beaten by any player capable of dodging out of an orange circle and who can understand what a breakbar is.
---
Honestly, as a non-elementalist, I wish I could set in preferences to put conjures at the last of my interact priorities. I don't want the weapon! I wanted to revive someone but apparently just the micrometer of position change means now F-to-Interact is now a pickup.
---
I had the same problem with the warrior banners
---
No, they are not. However, I've read the rest of your intelectual vomits in this thread and decided I am not interested in talking to a wall.
---
Have a nice day.
---
Yes I've read about the scourge barrier/revive build, and since I've always liked playing support that doesn't rely on heals I'm aiming for that in the future!
---
Condition Berserker build rotation question: I can't seem to squeeze the full burst in the Berserk duration, no matter how hard I try on the Golem. Does anyone have any tips? Are there any skills I have to cancel?
---
Nice troll bud. Try again
---
&gt; Really the majority of the bosses can be beaten by any player capable of dodging out of an orange circle and who can understand what a breakbar is.
---
Which is &lt;10% of the population.
---
&gt; jumping puzzles. 
---
Oh man random mesmers are the best for this. I remember doing a bunch of jumping puzzles (I think I was trying to get mastery points...) and I just couldn't do one of them (It's inside this mountain with an airship) I kept falling down and fuckin' dying. After a shamefully long time a mesmer pair comes along and used their portals as a kind of "checkpoint". They didn't skip me ahead, but made it so that even if I failed I wouldn't have to go through the WHOLE bloody thing again.
---
Turns out, they like going to these jumping puzzles specifically to help out like that.
---
**Major** props  to 'em.
---
I've also notice how slow necros kill but how much longer I get to drag a fight on XD
---
Viper is about 1% better against a single target, but Sinister pulls ahead in a big way when you can hit multiple targets, due to the way that Permeating Wrath works. Sinister is best in most real situations.
---
I always help when asked, however I absolutely hate it when people ask for gold. Maybe I view gold in a different way since I only farm and don't play the TP, but I feel like anyone asking for gold values their time more than other people's. And it's very, very easy to make a few gold when you really need it.
---
That's good to hear! Atm I want to completely finish all the story stuff first, so I'll get plenty of time before I tackle the serious stuff.
---
That photo has been floating around since at least 2013.
---
Yes I'm really excited for scourge Healer! Game is dense tho so it'll take a while lol.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Maybe if things like the Vabbian meta awarded a bundle of Funerary Incense per daily completion  so that those after Legendaries could have a break from grinding the same damn renown hearts &gt;.&gt;
---
Is it better to use a +9 AR than say a +5 Might / +5(or +7) AR infusion? I also have the infinite omni potion.
---
I constantly buy stuff for new armor combos so yes that’s why. Fused weapons are expensive!
---
&gt; Pretty sure Power Scourges are meta rn 
---
Correct that's what i stated 
---
&gt; Sure less healing and boon duration and not as tanky but the rest is there 
---
There is like nothing else a FB brings to a Zerg besides his spec and all the Points you're missing.  
---
Depending the Server and World you're playing on this wont give you much joy nor will it be exactly helpfull.  
---
/u/Etheri brought up the most important Point why this could be rly rly bad allready. If your Commander thinks that you actually heal you and your group is doomed.  
---
PS: i missread the surpreme and somehow thought you wrote surprise..... mb
---
You labeled some similarities. I am glad you realized that simply having some similarities does not equate two things, and it's the reason you called out open world =/= dungeons. This same thing applies to you calling the MSQ dungeons. Dungeons are additive content to the MSQ, and they almost always expand the lore of the MSQ. They are also much harder in difficulty compared to the MSQ as well as providing a good amount of unique rewards, whether it be gold amount, exp amount, weapons, etc. 
---
No, the MSQ are not dungeons. Please don't get ahead of yourself and put away the life advice.
---
My friends said they were very impressed by the world bosses. 
---
they needed a quick but exact intro on inventory management.
---
For some of my friends it was hard to adapt into such a free enviroment where there was no real main objective in the beginning, giving them a custom goal such as "get lv.30 so we can do dungeons" have proven to be a solid way to get them into the game.
---
Advice them to at least take some looks into trading and crafting, but dont push them too much, it will annoy them.
---
Dem feels bro
---
Just recently I have started doing my dailies, and running events on Cursed Shore, but the total amount for the night, I'm pretty sure it doesn't hit 15G/H, not close at all, maybe 2-3G.
---
Probably doesn't help that I play casually at nights only for like 2-3 hours.
---
Absolutely! But little young me didn't know this at the time :)
---
No sweat, it's in the past and I'm glad to have found the community now :)
---
Thank you!
---
Kid logic :P
---
meh, gotta agree when ChmSteki here. it's subjective.
---
for a lot of pre-HoT players, the only replayability dungeons had was the profit and that ended when Anet nerfed them some time ago. Fractals - pretty much the same thing - became objectively better in terms of rewards, especially as they buffed them over time with the dailies and whatnot.
---
I play as a human, so I'm not sure. But... Come a few months or years, and I'll get this reference, you'll see!
---
Thankfully it's safe to assume that next mount will have burning component on its engage skill.
---
Imo the most important thing is to spend a fun time together. 
---
Be silly, sit around a fireplace and do some half-assed RP, run around do events, do hearts, challenge each other (who can be the fastest to complete it, who can jump up a mountain the fastest, etc. etc.), generally do what you feel like. Here's where you come into play: Moderate the story, guide them along the events, but never "force" them to go somewhere.
---
Also try and get into dungeons once the level is appropriate, imo it's the first aspect of the game other than world bosses, where you can actually see a group of people working together to achieve a goal, especially because it's instanced and hence not as anonymous as open world.
---
Jumping puzzles are an absolute blast, I love them! Although keep in mind, that some people might find the movement confusing in the beginning, for example if they come from a point and click to move game (RTS, other MMORPGS, ...).
---
Another advice I always give new players is, that they have all the starting zones unlocked, so if they want to change their sourrounding from ascalon char to jungle sylvari or from "normal" human to snowy norn, they can always do that.
---
That's how it goes with teen-logic. Thankfully, I know better know.
---
Thank you! I'm from the MMO Istaria, so the no hand-holding mentality is something I'm very familiar with! :)
---
But I already like this so far :D
---
Mordremoth mind, Balthazar final battle, Joko final instance, Lazarus fight, Caudecus fight in ls3, Draconis Mons final fight with hounds of balthazar, Kralkatorrik's fight, every single time we were in the glint's lair, assault on rata primus, i can go on an on an on, but i rather end it on saying that you're an ignorant asshole who not only can not accept other people's opinion, but also flames on them.
---
But it'd be nice to have some variety. There's skills that benefit from burning, but others from bleeding, torment, posion and confusion.
---
Different mounts could get a short stack of different damage conditions after unlocking a mastery, like how the reaper gives other mounts damage, the skyscale could give other mounts condition damage. Since it'd be a PvE mastery, it would not affect WvW, and then we could get bleeding in warclaw, torment in jackal, poison in skimmer, confusion on raptor, etc.
---
that idea kind of became unnecessary when the Living World began assuming everyone had finished the Personal Story and Heart of Thorns.
---
&gt; Earth overload applies long duration protection, blast and 4s immob to 10 targets.
---
How does that help my DPS against a single target?   
---
And I spend what, 10 seconds doing little to no damage for that?   
---
Yes, to me that sounds as *the* definition of a gimped DPS ability.
---
don't need it for the short fight.
---
Are they part of **most stuff**? Do they hold an actual value? Yes? Then you talk about them when you're talking about wealth related topics.
---
If you are too poor to even consider acquiring them, then you shouldn't be talking about wealth acquisition in a manner as if you understand it better than the average joe.
---
Chak Infusion too costly for you? Okay, go buy an Ember Infusion in less than a week, playing only 1-3 hours a day. Come back when you succeed...you won't.
---
I picked Astralaria specifically for that reason you idiot (it's actually 11 days minimum). Too impossible for you? It should be. Here's a more reasonable one. Play 1-3 hours a day and make Nevermore in less than a week. Come back when you succeed...you won't.

[Did someone say e-sport ?](https://dviw3bl0enbyw.cloudfront.net/uploads/forum_attachment/file/84000/eACzJ4e.gif)
---
Somehow this kinda reminds me of attack on titan, Looks great tho !
---
You could try shortening the auto attack rotation by sheating your weapon in the end.
---
If you're doing T4 fractals and the 2g dailies you get an easy 15-20g at least, along with any other materials you get from the fractal chests. There's also multiple ways of farming gold, like Silverwastes, Istan (although not sure how worth it it is after the nerfs), doing a few fast HoT metas, event trains, but you might be bored of doing those just for farming. Raids give nice gold and drops, and PvP as well AFAIK. There's many many ways to get gold without trying too hard if you like them. Heck, even Tequatl gives you 2g+a lot of other stuff in 10 minutes.    
---
    
---
Also, as someone else said, don't always insta-sell your items on TP. Listing them is (usually) way more beneficial, it can get you quite a few more gold sometimes.
---
I think they just need to make conjures like banners.  It sucks for the few areas where having other classes pick them up is beneficial, but it would make everything work better.  Other options include removing them and buffing other areas as required because its a dumb as shit mechanic anyway, or making them not actually spawn on the ground, just the one you immediately get and reduce cds.
---
Whenever I introduce friends to the game, I show them just enough to get them started.  So i'll join them in the starter zone, show them a heart, show them gear and runes and sigils, show them an event.  Then I like to finish by showing them a world boss.  After that I slowly drift back (usually time it with a "oh look at the time i gotta go run some errands").  I like to give them breathing room and let them explore and figure stuff out on their own.  If they specifically ask for my help then i'll help.  I also pull off most of my gear when i'm actively playing with them as to not blow up all the mobs too fast.  It's a lot of smoke and mirrors to be honest.  Once they get their footing with everything and get higher up in level I start inviting them to higher up stuff.
---
Honestly, I found it very easy to level up in this game which I loved. I felt like I wasn't constantly struggling or grinding anything.
---
Yep! All of my VODs are saved automatically as I stream. They only last 2 weeks though, unless I manually save it as a video.
---
The point was that the rading comunty is not as big as people thought it would be. There are still people thinking that raids are the only thing people do in this game even though it kind of been proved that the raiding comunity is a small group. 
---
I still belive that raids are important to the game though and brought something to the game that we needed so don't read anything else in to this. I just say that the topic was not about raids being hard but raids having a small comunity. This are two different things.
---
idk where you get it from but I never said everyone can do it, just that there are possibilities to make such amounts
---
I agree, the fact that they did nothing with it besides lock a few of the map's hidden finds in there and put a story mission start in there really knocks the map down a few pegs. But I could've sworn it was one of the releases where they had to delay and ultimately deliver an unfinished product.
---
Don't go spending it all over the place. 
---
If you aren't wasting your stuff on other things 1 legendary every 11 month is pretty easy.
---
As for craft versus buy it depends but in nearly all cases(exceptions being Dusk and maybe Zap) you should buy the precursor instead of crafting it.
---
I'll give it another try when I get the chance, but I don't think there are any important auto attacks in the rotation that I'm delaying the F1s for.
---
Well wildly unbalanced classes sure didn't help.  If you think power reaper is bad now (benching 20-30% under top dps classes), you should have seen power dagger necro compared to an ele using the pre-nerf icebow 4.  Literally necro's best choice use to be going into lich form and autoattacking for the form's duration.  
---
Years of neglecting bugs pre-hot was pretty bad.  And then of course, with the release of hot Anet made the decision to nerf dungeon rewards and move those rewards to fractals (which they were able to then put behind the hot mastery paywall, additionally they introduced toughness scaling above fractal 75 and then locked good condi stats behind the hot paywall as well).  
---
I don't consider dungeons failed content.  I loved dungeons pre-hot, got the dungeoneer title etc.  I think we got our money's worth out of dungeons already.  However, you need to understand, pre-hot gw2 was in a weird place where they didn't know how to handle combat without a trinity, and so they just made everything a dps race where the good dungeon groups would just kill bosses before the boss could do anything challenging.
---
With hot's release, Anet introduced tanks and healers, and as a result, they could release content following a tried and tested mold.  This took pressure off them to be creative, they could look to their peers and burrow working ideas.    
---
I still think dungeons are cool, they are more about understanding how to stealth, burst damage, and move quickly.  Fast weapon swapping, knowing what blasts you have available, and how to use blocks to stay out of combat, dungeons test you on a different set of skills.  The combat however isn't as deep, but I think this has value.  Gw2 has an entire festival based around jumping puzzles, and dungeons based around agility and stealth (if your trying to be fast), and raids based around combat. I think that's a fine way to do things.  The only thing I think dungeons need to be good is a modernized reward system based on a daily system similar to fractals, with a corresponding lfg update to help connect groups.  However, one problem you might see, is the fact that stealth is only available to a few classes.  But in fractals and raids we have a meta that requires a boon support and a healer (sometimes), etc.  Dungeons have a meta that requires a stealther and a booner.  That seems fine to me.
---
Thank you for the smile . Well done
---
I dislike most hipsters but god damn do they know good food. Vinyl records and safety razors are also awesome.
---
I'm pretty sure you're right. It was a delay AND then a shoddy product on basically all accounts.
---
You’re too savage for your own good
---
Show them the game
---
So instead of: "Uh. Excuse me. My eyes are up here."
---
It's: "Uh. Excuse me. My GW2 logo is down here."
---
Thanks for taking the time to type that, I didn't know there were mounts now, that was one of my biggest complaints about the game when I was playing and its definitely enough to make me wanna try it again.
---
&gt; Trust me; I've also been nice enough to see the difference. You get leeches either way, you can try to deal with them effectively or you don't.
---
Yeah, no, I don't trust you. If you're seeing random idiots every five minutes while being abusive, how many do you see if you just don't talk to them and do your thing? Does cursing at them (which, really, is your only recourse when you want people to leave you alone) really significantly impact the number of people following you?
---
&gt; If kicking rangers and randoms from squad is toxic
---
Oh bud, we haven't been talking about kicking people out of your squad since the first reply in this chain, where have you been?
---
you might enjoy renegade shortbow as well
---
I am on the same boat, elite specs keep things interesting and fresh for months or even years.
---
Condi firebrand is pretty decent, Soulbeast isn't super AoE but has good condi. Warrior has a decent condi build with good AoE and some support potential.
---
No, but you do consider asking people to not follow a raid toxic. And if i say reeee it's toxic but if you call me toxic asshole 20 times over then ... that's different or the same or fuck knows what. Excuse me for not really trying to keep up with your "coherent" ramblings of how everyone who isn't catering to pugs is mean. Sorry!
---
I saw quite a few defending her on reddit. It's absolutely true.
---
I never suggested removing "features" but if you want to argue against yourself do feel free. Additional difficulties would also *add* content, not remove it. No one would seriously suggest that the presence of Shattered Observatory in Tier 1 fractals detracts from 100CM.
---
A solution for an easier difficulty that would still retain mechanics would be to increase the player cap in raids by X. This means mechanics would still need to be done, exactly as they are in normal, you just allow for a few more mistakes as you have more players, dps, healing and boons to throw at the boss. Is that a perfect solution? Probably not. Is it better than what we have currently? Absolutely. 
---
Guild Wars 2 raids are in a really awkward place. Not only are they too challenging for a large portion of the player base, meaning the resources aren't used by many, but they are also too easy for experienced players. 
---
This has a really deleterious effect on the raiding community, particularly with balance and release cadence being so poor. Experienced players have little to challenge them and nothing to progress towards. As a result, the content becomes boring and people stop playing it. Statics fall apart and players stop logging in. Yet the content is difficult to get into with the most common suggestions relying on guild connections or external player run initiatives. This results in less new people getting into the game mode and the overall community dwindling. 
---
I fully agree that the game needs to prepare players better, but easier and more difficult raid content can absolutely be part of that process whole benefiting the game in other positive ways.
---
OP didnt ask for a workaround. But you know that, you're just here to insult others.
---
Everything you do rewards you with loot (items/materials/etc.), sell the loot on the TP (or keep what you need/want)-&gt; gold.  
---
You occasionally will get a good drop worth more than gold than usual.  
---
Try do the daily tasks: Dailies, fractals T4. Meta andWorld Bosses, those reward rare equipment which you can salvage and get ectos and sell on TP for gold.    
---
There's also PvP which will gradually get you gold and materials to sell.
---
Exactly how many people in this thread do you think can do what you're talking about?
---
You're replying to average players, talking about something average players can't do...as if it was so easy.
---
I'm willing to bet, that you, yourself, can't even do what I proposed.
---
&gt; Got nothing
---
[how hard did you look](https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&amp;ei=R7G4XJDfM8n3kwWz8YawAQ&amp;q=willoo+bug)?
---
You must die a lot then.
---
Jason and Freddie. Don't see the downsides.
---
&gt; They realized that a dungeon required a lot of work and not that many people were actually doing them. 
---
I mean when dungeons was the only endgame PvE content ppl used to do them quite frequently... isn't it more like with the introduction of fractals and raids ppl stopped doing them cause they aren't rewarding enough anymore??
---
Well, fair enough. I dont remember how much gold I had when I first leveled a character to 80, so youre probably right.
---
How about the best of both worlds.
---
A living world season that goes to another continent like Cantha and slowly opens it up episode by episode
---
Giving us new elite specs, new weapon types, new world bosses, armor, mounts, fractals, raids, elite dungeons and so on.
---
Same goes for letting them collect dust.
---
Agreed.
---
We used to run dungeons because we needed the exotic gear stats offered by some dungeons.  It was the only way to get it.  Now end-game has abandoned  the need for the once 'core' game modes and provided short-cuts.  Like cutting of crafting at the knees by giving away ascended gear for at least 6 months trying to buy players for WvW and PvP.
---
Oi oi, it still kick ass, I was just pointing out that it looked diferent than the rest ;D
---
It comes off as a humble brag tbqh
---
Good idea as well.
---
No, the nearest waypoint then becomes free of charge.
---
I don't have a specific way to make gold. I play stuff and when I want something I just look down what I have and what I need additional to that what I want. You just need to manage the things you have good to make profit with it.
---
Don't instasell don't instabuy! Craft materials up before you sell them. Farm things instead of buying them and so on.
---
That was what I figured it was at first. "woe is me, look at all this ascended gear i just can't possibly use #firstworldproblems", etc. :P
---
This and early on entire dungeons were roughly ignored outside of farming singular paths. All we did was  CoF p1  cause best income and done in about 5 minutes.
---
But muh account worth
---
Really cool that you do this!
---
I'll take "Problems I *Wish* I Had" for 800, Alex.
---
Not too much, I know a lot of people who have the same problem. If you raided/did fractals for long enough it legit can become a problem.
---
What about her boobs ?
---
The solution for this problem is not salvaging them. Why would I want to salvage them? I would feel like throwing them away or just destroying them because I get nothing for that.
---
I already use my boxes and I like to keep them so I can always keep using more whenever I want to gear a new character.
---
If we already can stack multiple king of gear chests why wouldn't be possible to do the time to these ones?
---
What idea?
---
Well let see ...
---
315 with +15s would mean 15 x 18 + 45 = 315 AR
---
315 x 1.5 = 472.5 precision gained
---
472.5 / 21 = ~ +22.5% (rounding should have occurred so this is probably off a bit)
---
So +9s would give 9 x 18 + 45 = 207 AR
---
207 x 1.5 = 310.5 precision gained
---
310.5 + 90 = 400.5 from the +5s
---
400.5 / 21 = 19.07%
---
Now we can go backwards. 22.5 - 19.07 = 3.43
---
3.43 x 21 = 72.03 precision
---
That is nearly the exact amount of difference in precision between two Berserker earrings versus two Assassin earring. It is only short by the 0.03 which is 0.001% crit chance so if one gave you 100% crit this might leave you at 99.99% crit.
---
Why am I assuming they are starting with Berserker earrings? Because I am assuming they are starting with a full berserker set and I am assuming they are starting with a full Berserker set because I interpreted
---
&gt; did higher average damage also...
---
to mean higher than rest of the group which brings us to concentration. Yes the concentration is nice and in fact you get more benefit there than from the precision since both crit chance and boon duration caps at 100% but you only need 15 concentration for each percent of boon duration versus 21 for crit chance. However if the group's support is out damaging the DPS then I think that become a different discussion.
---
Anyway back to the precision. Changing to Assassin is not without it's price. Gaining 72 precision means losing 72 power. 
---
18 +15 = 7147g
---
18 +5/+9 = 1585g
---
TL;DR: Paying 5,562g for 72 Power is not worth it ... but I don't have gold burning a hole in my pocket.
---
It's 15 gold per hour only IF you sell all the mats you get from salvaging your drops.
---
Which probably means you have a shitload of mats in your bank worth a pretty penny. Start selling those leather squares!
---
You never know when you'll need it. The gear that you want to use has the potential to change every major patch
---
Step 1: Open them
---
Step 2: Salvage them
---
Step 3: As the Quaggan of Bitterfrost state dryly: "Taaah-daaaah"
---
Because with the Chrono I've learned that the entire world can change every 2 months. I've used like 50 of those items on my alts last year, just to say.
---
Even if you aren't struggling ... one of the mobs have the flash freeze mod. That thing is just so goddamn annoying. =_=
---
Oh yes, we've only gotten started =) I'm so excited!
---
That's actually brilliant, I might try that if I can plan it correctly
---
I bully friends into playing lol. Then again they do this to me and then stop playing that game they.bullied me into. Monster Hunter world and Conan and ark....
---
Hmm, we shall see 🤔
---
But deadeye has pretty good dps
---
Are you using proper buffs? Without quickness and alacrity, the rotation will not properly fit inside the berserk window.
---
Never. They'll do GW3 before they completely rework GW2. Same effort, more money for it to show.
---
asdfghjkl you got me to cackle at work so thanks for the awkward stares lol
---
&gt; If raids weren't hard, we wouldn't be needing training groups just to get into raiding. 
---
So what you're saying is that despite your complaints that the only groups out there require absurd LI and kill proof, you acknowledge that there are groups out there that will take you but don't want to join them?
---
Wait but don't I also need maxed-out mastery paths to go the Maguuma route?
---
It doesnt have to be weapons, armor boxes dont stack either and there's plenty of options for that.
---
It's not like this is the first time they've done restructuring though. This might be one of the first times that we hear about it directly from ANet instead of having it trickle through.
---
Not really. Once I collect enough chests, I make a duplicate set or gear a new character. Problem is that I can get 5 chests of boots, 6 chests of gloves and no leggings or shoulders.
---
Maybe. I mean yeah I guess that makes sense but on the other hand there are other games who has made the decision to keep working on their engine instead of going with a new game.
---
Fractals rewards are way better, but at least dungeons gives you 1lvl up, no wait they made lvl up tome  a thing, destroying for good dungeons.
---
With my 200 agony on my Boon firebrand its pretty the best since i can Go for Full berserk gear. But yeah +5 are nice but higher crit, thoughness and concentration is nothing to Complain about also since you boost all 3 at the same Time with it Not only one.
---
In 100CM? They sure as fuck do. Artsariiv is pure hell without some sustain to back you up. The other are not that hard to do without a healer, but Artsariiv is a nightmare.
---
I sort of did it as a challenge or restriction on my account not to do any crafting, and I'm in the endgame now but still doing okay
---
I actually have 500 cooking but that was for my guild, haven't used it since
---
Different games, different cases. GW2 can't just be upgraded. You'd have to rebuild it from scratch. And that's not just me joking around, they'd have to genuinely start completely over. They couldn't just, again, necro their own GW1 engine for GW2.5. They'd have to create a new one. So they'd have to create a GW3 engine, and then they use it to re-create GW2 as an upgraded GW2.5 version?
---
Yeah, no.
---
If anything, we'll see GW3 before GW2.5 happens.
---
Stat swapping still works on gear you get from chests
---
it is now ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
And...you can't Mystic Forge their weapons/armor why?
---
You can do the golem rotation without any stowing (assuming ping is fine), its just a question of practising more to be fast enough. Also, the final sword f1 doesn't gain you a lot so don't worry too much.
---
I think you do not understand how much ascended armor players who raid every week for years have accumulated.  This isn't particularly hard or exception or noteworthy of bragging, it is quite common in the raid community.
---
Because I need 2 playsets to play both. That's 10 armor/weapon sets per alt. Surely there's some interchangeable stuff, but why would I make further legendary armors?
---
Insignia/Inscription boxes can be stacked, are you against those chests being like that too?
---
[ARENA NET] [Stephane Lo Presti.7258 posted on 2019-04-18 18:51:06](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/74020/upcoming-map-changes-for-eternal-coliseum-and-djinn-s-dominion):
---
&gt; Hi, folks!
---
&gt;
---
&gt;We’d like to give you a preview of some upcoming changes to two PvP maps.
---
&gt;Up first is Eternal Coliseum. We wanted to give this map more spaces where players can jump around and try to break line of sight. Additionally, we wanted to differentiate between each side of the map a bit better so it’s easier to know where you are just by looking around. To do this, we’re adding hedges on one half of the map, and building supplies on the other. 
---
&gt;![](http://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/34337newcol1.jpg "")
---
&gt;![](http://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/ecc02newcol2.jpg "")
---
&gt;Next up is Djinn’s Dominion, where our goal is to reduce the ability to spawn camp the other team from the start of the game. To that end, we’ve added a wall between the spawn areas which stretches to the lamp platform. A gate will open in the wall after some time so players don’t have to run through the middle of the map to get to the far side through the whole match.
---
&gt;![](http://d3b4yo2b5lbfy.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/6c01anewdjinns.jpg "")

^(Beep boop bleep. I'm a bot. Message me or /u/Xyooz if you have any questions, suggestions or concerns.) [^Source ^Code](https://gitlab.com/networkjanitor/docker-polarbytebot-gw2-submission-transcriber)
---
So regardless of stacking chests you'll still have multiple pieces of Ascended gear that cannot be stacked...and opening the chests just consumes more instead of...Mystic Forging for the stats you need as you need them...
---
&gt;If we have 5x "Defender's Chest of Shoulders" would be nice if they could stack instead of using 1 inventory slot each.
---
[¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯](https://imgur.com/ElgE1F8).
---
I think you don't understand the scales we are talking about.  Players who full clear raids weekly for a few years are at least at an order of magnitude higher scale than what your describing.
---
Aw, that's unfortunate! Another person asked this, so I thought it might be relevant to put it here: all of my streams are saved automatically in VODs on twitch.tv, and I have the option to save them permanently. You're more than welcome to go through the video whenever you want, that way you can map in your own time :D
---
Thanks for sharing
---
Those alts are the ones already having space occupied by those chests. Again, I get your point about Mystic Forging, but still why can't we have stackable ascended chests?
---
Other:  If they release new elite specs with a living story episode or something it's be fine.  If they don't end up releasing new elite specs then it's a bad sign.
---
Yes! I actually plan to have one of my stream regulars be the "camera man" of the tour, where they would find some nice spots/vantage points to take pictures of the group (and I'm happily paying them for this). If your screenshots are good, I'd be more than happy to take them off your hands and provide a tip to show my appreciation &lt;3
---
Awesome. I'll definitely see you then &lt;3
---
Yeah that's the one I can't squeeze in. I can get the final sword 5 in most of the time but the final sword F1 is probably only 10% of the time
---
Thank you! I pretty much only play this game to do large-scale events like this, so it's definitely my pleasure.
---
You know, you could just make legendary armor and then you wouldn't need to store 400 pieces of armor for "just in case" or "fun builds".
---
So when do you think we will see GW3/get an engine update?
---
But... They de-emphasized dungeons for fractals? And then nerfed the rewards into the ground because people were still running them.
---
And then people stopped running after full "only do it once a day before rewards become complete trash" pass.
---
Rewards got upped up a little bit begrudgingly but never to the point of being on par with say fractals.
---
So.... Got exactly what they were gunning for. As designed :P
---
I think they are pointing out a similar thing. That people don't need to hoard chests upon chests so that they can stat-select as the meta changes. If they have 3 torches then that is probably plenty, any excess can be opened and salvaged, as stat changes can be made via Mystic Forge.
---
These look really cool, much more possibilities to kite and outplay.
---
Power quickbrand combines that aspect of FB with big crits and boon support. I really like playing it.
---
You hang your labels as if they held any inherent meaning, as if they were somehow self-evident. Call a lamp “fake.” Call a table “hurt.” Call yourself “smart.” But that’s not how words work. Words are supported by either a lexicon, a metaphor, or an argument. A person who says and does smart things, for example, has grounds to argue that they are a smart person. You don’t. You’re just a kid with a label gun.
---
You see, an argument has three parts. First, there’s the claim. A claim is just an opinion. You have that part down. You just love your opinions. The second part is the support - you know, the evidence? You just made a very sad attempt at that. The third step is the warrant. That’s where you explain the logic of how the support fits the claim. Again, I’m talking about logic - not handwavy bullshit. If I claim that green is square because platypus... that doesn’t work. There’s no warrant there. 
---
To be clear, I’m telling you all this because you don’t already know this stuff. Clearly. You’ve just been shitting words all over Reddit. 
---
People can’t argue with someone like you. And it’s not because of your “intellect.” Haha. No, quite the opposite. It’s because you’re not able to make meaningful statements. It’s like trying to play handball off a curtain. There no correspondence. There’s no static reference frame. There’s no establishment of priorities. You just squirm your words into whatever form your gelatinous ego demands. It’s a waste of time. Even this - everything I’m saying to you - is wasted on you.
---
But I’m going to allow you to have what you so desperately seek: the last word. Shit your words. Go akimbo with your label guns. Or remain silent and concede defeat. I don’t care one way or the other. I won’t read it anyway. Have a good one.
---
The wiki has a [great tool](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Agony_Resistance#AR_calculator) for customizing your AR load-out. Includes ways to do it without buying the game as well.
---
How do you know they work exactly like those chests, or are you making assumptions based entirely upon how similarly they function?
---
I'm talking about the ascended boxes, not about the weapons. Also I already use them when I need them.
---
that is exactly it (:
---
Coliseum update is really nice. Lots of new kiting spots which is fantastic as the map was lacking them.
---
Djinn's dominion is hmm. I guess the change is nice. Really prevents pushing far though. I think the map still needs more changes though, and they've said they're not adding it to ranked yet.
---
Yay another NA map completion..ugh :'c
---
All I see is that rack and milk
---
Well you are right. I do not understand the need to save years worth of rewards and not spend them. 
---
Is there some point that a player needs hundreds of pieces of ascended gear? I'm not being snarky here I am honestly asking. 
---
I understand how annoying it is to have non stacking items, said items would need to have a value to be saved in the first place that outweighs their sell value of its contents.
---
Wow that's pretty ridiculous
---
Nice plot
---
Yeah I just buy from the tp and use raid drops for the rest
---
Could still be better. Had a few runs that would of probably been around a 5:15, but lost them in the bear cave. A couple more skips that could save some time, plus starting with the invulnerability start could maybe make a sub 5 possible/feasible.
---
Someone bring op a beer, and stick this post.
---
&gt; I actually have 500 cooking but that was for my guild, haven't used it since
---
congrats on worlds first!!!
---
BoobWars2
---
Oh nice, same degree field here; I work in avionics systems and have to sift through the code of decades prior to see how teams of people worked to create a product, and I can say beyond reasonable doubt that similar functionality != same base code, especially if multiple parties are developing parallel systems.

We have no hard facts other than gut feeling that these chests are encoded the same way and the simple flip of a flag will "correct" their capability to be stacked. And we also don't know the impacts or limitations that exist in converting over these "single" chests into a "stacking" variant might pose. It's something worth asking for I suppose, but again, it feels like an arbitrary and forced issue that is literally solved by opening your excess chests and salvaging. The pieces have no worth until opened anyway, Ascended armor and weapons can be stat-changed, and sitting on a hoard only seems to prove problematic.
---
Ever have a customer call you asking about a tiny concern such as the in-flight software panel's dialogue box sporting the slightly wrong shade of green than they requested, and while it's something that can and should be fixed, you're trying to address the fact that the smoke detectors' relevant fault signal isn't being sent which is a much more pressing matter? Yeah that's what this "problem" feels like to me.

Whoops I mean whatever is the highest level on cooking, 400 I assume

Don’t need money to go to wvw
---
I use tp and mystic forge to stat change for some stats like berserker and raid drops for the rest. And nah I keep my old stuff, meta often swings back or another class can use it
---
Please let me [send](https://gw2efficiency.com/c/Shinalia%20Shadowsea) you all my [junk](https://gw2efficiency.com/c/Cynthion).

I don't have enough inventory space to open all that!

Nah just how you have to feed pvpers

So you're running into an inventory wall because of mismanagement?

NA, I think it was called Northern Shiverpeaks =)

I am currently crafting a ascended set for my power reaper. What stats should i go for if i want to do good in high level fractals and raids? Im thinking about going with Valkyrie but i want to be sure.
---
THE CAKE IS A LIE
---
Doesn't really look like it... but it kind of reminds me of the rabbit from Donnie Darko
---
ANet is still mostly artists.
---
I think it's more likely to get reworked maps, new events and other artistic assets than engine updates.
---
do it then
---
This is at least 5 years old
---
Never ever ever ever EVER delete old characters. Everything birthday gives you a level scroll (starting at lvl 20) dye pack you can choose dyes from (expensive dyes) and evertually get special skins that you have to wait for like 5 or 6 to get. Swapping worlds only changes what server you join for wvw. Server swapping does nothing else but that.
---
What I'd love to do is salvaging ascended gear to unlock stats for that gear, then load the stats on other ascended items with templates.
---
Salvage Ascended sword with Berserker stats, now you can apply Berserker stats to all your swords. 
---
That way we don't need to hoard ascended chests anymore. Just equip your characters, and use the rest to unlock more stats for more types of gear.
---
In addition I think people definitely oversimplify how it is to do fractals without some form of heals. 
---
It's not just burst, you need fast CC and good dodges + positioning And for the times the bosses can't be CCed. I am terrible at positioning, so you can imagine I'm not really capable of fractals without some form of healing.
---
Guess it's time to learn to farm and change your perception. It's been a while since i've heard about people spending real money for gems.
---
We're not going to get an engine update.  You can't compare a company like ArenaNet with 1-2 major successes with something like Blizzard which has multiple successful, world-renowned and pioneering IP's like World of Warcraft, Starcraft, Diablo, Hearthstone, and Overwatch.  They service and solicit to multiple different communities and extract far more revenue than GW2 does.  
---
An engine overhaul would be a massive undertaking.  I'd love for the game to receive more attention and optimization, but the truth is that it's a limited scope fantasy game that has limited appeal.  It doesn't attract scifi, loot-crawler, tcg or battle royale audience.  The reality is that GW2 has a very limited slice of the pie when it comes to gaming audiences.  We're lucky that we get updates at all.  
---
Furthermore, GW2 is B2P.  Both WoW (Blizzard) and FF XIV (Square Enix) extract a monthly subscription of what, $10-15/month? That's a huge amount of money that GW2 doesn't have access to, and honestly, many people I know would drop the game outright over a subscription.  It just isn't happening.  An engine re-work isn't on the table, and it won't ever be on the table.
---
Nope my inventory is fine I have a decent amount of bank slots and a mule character
---
While it's true that Reaper is a lot less reliant on precision than other power dps, you still really don't want to go full Valkyrie.
---
Honestly, I'd just recommend Berserker as it overlaps with every other power DPS out there, while Valk is super niche. If you're dead set on running some Valkyrie pieces, make sure you are still running enough berserker to be sitting at ~40.5% crit chance unbuffed, or else you won't be crit capped outside of shroud, even in ideal situations.
---
I would have bought the "they take too long and too many resources to make" excuse a lot more if they never put in raids.
---
don't care. I'm in love.
---
I'm a simple man, don't judge me.
---
That's fine for them but I'm not a gold seller.
---
What do TP fees have to do with not being poor?
---
&gt; People can’t argue with someone like you.
---
It's because in most cases, they are not upset because they disagree with what I said (which would be an argument), but how I said it...or...because they didn't want to hear the factual statement, because they were enjoying living in ignorance. Nobody likes it when people break their ignorance. "Ignorance is bliss" is a factual statement for a reason.
---
Maybe you have enough intellect to realize which one you fall under, but I wouldn't be surprised if you don't, considering your intellectual inferiority.
---
&gt; Go akimbo with your label guns. Or remain silent and concede defeat.
---
Do you realize your own idiocy and hypocrisy yet? You have to be a colossal idiot to expect no response with such a statement.
---
So, going back to it, you have only continued to verify your intellectual inferiority, and your insecurity regarding your intellectual inferiority.
---
Well I felt I had to remove it because people was saying I was like bragging that I had so many chests when my only intention to make a QoL suggestion that (in my opinion) it's good for all of us...

All non China stuff is open to use worldwide, there's no regionalocking for gw2 outside of China because that's handled by a different publisher.

fractals still level sync you to 80, so technically you can use them to level up, if you don't get kicked.

"We" is the reddit admins, because this isn't related to GW2 whatsoever. OP found an old reddit announcement, changed a few words, like changing "reddit" to "game", and reposted it with the intent of sowing confusing and misinformation.

Here is the original announcement that OP edited: https://www.reddit.com/r/help/comments/aea649/recently_locked_out_of_your_account_help_is_on/

Which would invalidate the reason that Dungeons give you exp.

OP: pikachu face

I've started playing ff14 and the raids all have a story mode which is pretty easy. you can wipe and some mechanics aren't exactly self explanatory but after a few runs it's clear. they also have a lfg roulette where people can join any group that needs players, for bigger rewards (especially great for leveling, even the older raids). 
---
the result is, queues for raids are usually less than 15 minutes (even for DPS, healers and tanks tend to have insta queues anyway) during primetime, there's always experienced people around and nobody flames a newby or asks them to ping LI. 
---
quite frankly, anet dropped the ball in many regards when it comes to group content, and their inability to learn from others is saddening.
---
Thank you kindly! And this is really awesome, thanks for sharing.
---
NGL as a Weaver I have definitely, on more than one occasion, picked up another Weaver's Lightning Hammer when fumbling for my Fiery Greatsword in the fluctuating glow of a raid.
---
well, the wiki could be wrong, I just remembered it and quickly checked the wiki to be sure I wasn't misremembering. 
---
but dungeon xp is still good, combined with the gold and tokens. at least until you've unlocked all skins you want, then their use suddenly drops a fair bit and ANet refuses to rethink rewards of old content. I mean brainless farms like istan give a ton more gold than running dungeons (be it at level or at 80), which is quite absurd.

If you didn't make it, then why didn't you credit the [creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONFHrt0-AZQ)?

OMG! I actually looked at the original post earlier and didn't notice

You're brilliant. Please, people, don't let pass this oportunity.
---
Not at all! In total, it'll be about 10 hours, I know for a fact that not many people can even just sit down for that long. Since this is the first time I'm doing this, I'm not sure how well it'll go. If it's anywhere near as successful as my Heart of Thorns trains, I'll likely be making this into a monthly event as well! :\]
---
I got so many requests for it, so I figured why not :D
---
I'm looking to eventually get partnered by ArenaNet, and if that happens, I can swap back and forth between servers for free :\] If that ever happens, I'll definitely be taking these over to EU as well.

No

Oh cool a new pvp map

Is this a joke...?

Machete and Obsidian Shards.
---
What's your favourite class?  Pick their best weapon.
---
There's also really no reason it should be your only Ascended weapon for quite some time, unless you're expansion-less.  Take a look into the Specialization Collections for your elite specs as those are quite attainable.  As well, if you've finished the Heart of Thorns storyline, pursue the followup you'll receive afterwards in the mail to work towards a reasonably easy Ascended weapon.

I've had mine since day 1

What a well written response, thanks for expressing your opining that was grounded in experience and knowledge.

Well done, great job!

I doubt it needs much explanation
---
Ppl alrdy have trouble with 2 weapons to do a decent rotation. Think about 3. This will break there brain so hard hahaha
---
This is perfect
---
Unlocking a weapon is a major part of professions, would be stupid to mix them up.
---
No dude not having 3 weapons, just the ability to equip a weapon specific tree weapon at any time with any build once you have the tree unlocked.
---
You would still have two weapons, but you would be able to have an axe/torch in one slot and a longbow in the other as a firebrand guardian. 
---
Which longbow is only allowed when you are in the dragon hunter tree.
---
Sylvari Thief but the Sylvari is the ranger, not the Thief.
---
Well so much for a discussion.
---
You mean the other way round right?
---
Pretty sure it would be doable to repack it as one box with full set or same pieces type.  
---
And while were at this, I wish there would be also an option to exchange these chests for other pieces with currency, tokens, whatever else items; because it's no fun when you get all the time same legs, shoulders, chest type and not boots or helmet.
---
i think OP means "espec weapons" with "tree specific weapons" and not "three specific weapons"
---
Anyone know when the Dervish / Scythe / Chainsword is going on sale? 
---
Thought I read it was supposed to be on sale this week.
---
Its been discussed to death in 2015 already

Season 3 living world had tons of ascended trinkets with the option to CHOOSE the stat you wanted (core + hot stats) why does only the second map have that option with (core + pof stats) and the rest of the maps have fixed   pof stats???!

Good - Expansions can be barriers to new players.  As an example, I left WoW ages ago and when I went to return I had to buy 3 expansions.  It wasn't worth the cost even if it meant I was playing with friends.  Therefore I don't mind that they are not investing in another expansion right now.  They know the cost is an issue.  Cast your mind back to the Release of HoT, if you bought the expansion you got the base game for free.  It made it easier for new players to get in.  
---
You can see this lesson if you look back to GW1, with every campaign/expansion more people were turned off by the cost.  I owned them all but the friends I played with dropped off one by one.  I never bothered finishing Eye of the north because everyone I enjoyed playing was gone and you couldn't always finish with the 
---
I'd rather see each living world season treated as a slow release expansion which, to me at least, seems to be where they are going.  This rewards the existing player base, keeps people engaged, and can be bought in bits and pieces to keep the initial cost of entry down for new players.

no, u

Do what i did. Drop it out in the open but not tooo far that youll lose dps. I knew everytime after that and would half ass my rotation after. (This is with my own static) i dislike weaver a lot when staff was the best to use for bosses but i learned it anyways for my group. Stealing my conjures that i hate using in the first place..what was the point of me learning then lol
---
Really nice! Congratz! Three moments: 
---
1) The fish. Sad you missed the perfect run with it.
---
2) That afk time is so funny! I definitly need to try that next year.
---
3) How on earth you and some other speedrunners are able to bounce on walls ?! Just before the big river you did it... Made you avoid the Hilbilies path.
---
if my mammary serves correctly, this is the best advertising since factions
---
Obviously Arena Net do intend for us to sit on them since it is not very hard to pile them up if you are actively playing. 
---
I accept that it is not a problem for you, i mean that is fine but that is how you deal with things. Does not mean others have to play it your way. 
---
And since we can stack exotic boxes with gear. You can stack tons of other things as well, then why are you bothered about the question of stacking ascended gear? How is this such a issue for you that you keep on protesting?
---
[removed]
---
I could not for the love of anything understand why you were upset over some one asking for stacking of ascended boxes when we already have this on exotic boxes. But then i read this comment and realise this is you having feelings about him having so many and there for decide it must be about bragging. 
---
Could it not just be about the fact that he would really want to be able to stack the boxes and reddit is a good spot to ask about it?
---
Certainly the breast advertisement I have seen from them yet..but we are yet to see tits final form yet.

the mods should nip this in the bud soon.

i was building my power holosmith and needed a rifle.

so what do you think i did choose? :D
---
Anet when reddit whines about hard content.
---
Feels inefficient, especially if you need it later on. You generally need quite a few chests to gear anyway 6 for armor and another 2 or 3 for weapons in most cases. 
---
That's 8-9 chests per pop so I'd say it's better to let it collect dust, in the event that new elite spces ever come out, lets say you have every class, thats probably ~80 chests.
---
Salvaging them all with net hardly anything compared to the cost to make them so I'd say it's worth the wait IMO, so yea.. RIP bank space

#WÜNTERBLUTEN
---
holy shit... that's 600 more times than I've died on my main over nearly 3k hours
---
Are you free to play? Or did you buy the game? Free to play can’t use most of BLTC.
---
Then after that show them few minidungeons, at 21 explain traits and at 30 do Ascalon.
---
There are a few things I do if I need some gold. I will list what I feel is most reasonable (cuz multiaccounting probably isn't your thing):
---
- Do Tequatl. He gives 2g and over 10k karma.
---
- Daily. Doesnt matter which 3 quests, just do whatever is fastest or most enjoyable.
---
- Kill the Matriarch at Verdant Brink for the Amalgamated Gemstone. Its spawn at :09 whenever it's night. Just join 2 minutes before that. No need to do any events whatsoever, it always spawns no matter what. You can even walk up to his spawn location if you don't want to wait for the chopper.
---
- Participate in or leech Auric Basin meta for another Amalgamated Gemstone. For the first time each day, you don't have to do any events; chests spwan after the event succeeded even if you join after it's done. Once a day.
---
- If you can, do daily T4 fractals.
---
- Find any event train. Doesn't matter which map, just do some events and sell all your loot. I enjoy Auric Basin and Silverwastes RIBA the most.
---
If you sell everything you got from that - which in total shouldnt take you more than 2 hours - you will have made some nice gold without being stuck in the same place forever. What I find is that doing a little bit of everything keeps you sane whilst making gold. :) If you don't have 2 hours, just do whatever you feel like doing. Most important is not to spend on things you don't need and to actually sell your stuff if you need raw gold. You'll be surprised how much you will make from materials once you stop depositing them. :D
---
Oh, that sucks! Yeah I’m just f2p.
---
At tier 4, *good* groups can run without a Druid, but they usually still take spirits via a power soulbeast and still take healing via a healing firebrand or renegade.
---
As much as I love the thought of using Scrapper Hammer without the rest of the scrapper tree, this is a bad idea. It breaks down the most notable aspect of elite specs, and opens up lots of mechanical issues (Holo sword no longer being able to scale with heat, Deadeye rifle having antisynergy with regular steal).
---
They said druid, not healer. My CM group puts the alacrity ren or the quickness FB on heal duty while not taking a druid.
---
Well yeah, obviously some little things like hp bars and common mmo mecanics are going to be in both but the style, the gameplay, the way you grind, etc is just all different.
---
we have very limited footage of the thing, and you bothered to write all this? wow.
---
anatomy... if this bothers you, i'd like to see your take on the shatterer and kralkatorrik... or zhaitan for that matter.
---
the quality of the skin... c'mon, you are literally comparing the base skin with default dye, to a gemstore skin with high contrast dyes.
---
and you seem to think that these aspects of the mount were put together simce the layoffs? sweet summer child.
---
this has more holes than any pre-release warclaw speculation i've seen.
---
A greatsword
---
I'll be honest, while this was very meticulously though out, this shit isn't even out yet.  I'll hold my judgments, especially on the animations, until the final polished version comes out.
---
This comment section is pathetic af.
---
Ok first of all, WOW, such detail and analysis. upvoted.  
---
Second, the mount isn't out yet, so what we see its probably what we call, "work in progress", it may look exactly as it is or better when it's released.  
---
Third, Devs took a step and shown something a lot earlier than then expected, they usually release teasers and trailers one week before the final release most of the time, so we get to see the new mount quite earlier.  
---
Finally, sometimes releasing new content takes a lot of time, and this isn't an expansion like release, so probably they didn't have the amount of time and devpower to make it as cool as griffon (we don't know for sure yet, it's not released), but i am ok with it because i prefer to have a new mount now than in 2 years when the new expansion will be released.
---
Having 3 paths maybe.
---
This 100% , we got to see a quite early teaser, we don't know what the final release will look like.
---
Look closely:
---
No belt. Gross.
---
Not even staring at an amazing rack.
---
&gt; The concept of dungeons was not expandable except you introduced a completely new dungeon to the game. By that concept, it would mean creating the context for the dungeon, creating 4-5 different paths (one for the story and 3-4 explorable) with their own story, new loot, new armour and new stuff overall. The token system was also, questionable.
---
They didn't have to continue doing this. ESO dungeons originally had 2 paths but with new dungeons they have pared it down to 1 path but having a good story and interesting mechanics in every dungeon.
---
Its really not, speaking as someone who likes story based dungeons.
---
&gt; At launch it was established that dungeons comes with 3 unique armor sets and a weapon set. New ones would have to follow the same principles.
---
Why?
---
If you left before they introduced Ascended that was *really* early. Ascended started getting introduced 3 months after launch.
---
At that point, I'd treat it as a new game tbh. So much has changed over the last 6.5 years, and you likely weren't super familiar with it to begin with (Not a sleight, not many if any of us were at that point.)
---
Put your max character aside (For the love of god don't delete it.) make a new character, and level is *until you feel comfortable*. Doesn't have to go all the way to 80. Read the tutorials on your level up reward, as lots of systems have been either utterly replaced or tweaked along the way.
---
When you're comfortable, go back to your max level.
---
Honestly, it's better to just avoid someone who wants to bully you. I was bullied in my first year of high school when I was about 11 years old and it continued until my mum complained to the school and had me moved to a different class. I got on much better then, I made friends and actually enjoyed school thereafter. I've had other experiences with people who seemed content to drag others down and being friendly to them anyway just harmed relationships I actually cared about.
---
Suffice to say, trying to get along with people who have no care or respect for you just doesn't work. They didn't like you then, they're not going to like you just because you play the same game as them, and they're not going to like you no matter what you change in your life to fit what you think they want from you.
---
The viper+renegade actually does a larger fraction of its damage as condition damage.  It's the SGV plus Balthazar (or Flame Legion) that's the 'power' focused version.
---
Well, that also makes sense, tbh.
---
Pretty much this. I would wait until it had shipped before delving into that level of analysis.
---
Thank you! And also, I hope so! It sort of turned into a bit of more of a "how much ridiculous detail can I cram into this" game at some point and I just rolled with it. I don't think it's going to be the end of the world even if it releases exactly as it was shown in the trailer.  I am extremely happy that we got to see the new content at all too, and I really hope people don't interpret this as "man this guy must really hate anet to have done all this" because that really wasn't my intention at all. Thanks for your feelback :D
---
Yes
---
Think of Free to Play as a generous free trial to the game. The list of restrictions is *very* large. It should be used to see if you like the game enough to buy it, and not much more than that.
---
Welcome to Guild Wars 2!
---
Best advice on bullying I can give is, just ignore them and stay away from them, they're a force of negativity and you don't want to let people like that influence your life. In any case, I hope it didn't give a bad impression of what Guild Wars players are like, most of us are pretty friendly. I'd recommend joining a guild to help you out with some of the basics, this game tends to rocket you up to level 80 and then leave you there wondering what to do next and a guild can give you some direction in that regard.

Fractals are dungeons, just renamed. The same basic concepts apply as far as gameplay is concerned. Group of 5, tackle bosses/boss events with trash in between, get loot at the end. 
---
They ARE dungeons. In every sense of the word, except the actual word.
---
I'll upload and link you sometime this weekend
---
Not only is it a bad idea that would mean we'd have people running even worse builds it would also limit future elite specs.
---
The way it's set up now they could release a future Guardian Elite Spec that also uses an axe, but gives you completely different axe skills. There is no need to decide which set is the "default" and no need to handle how that default would conflict with someone not owning the defaults expansion. 
---
It would also cause issues and limit future elite specs whose weapon has strong ties to their elite spec mechanic.
---
The bleeds are stronger with Viper, and basically negligible in Sinister. However, the burns are stronger in Sinister due to more raw condition damage stat.
---
But that isn't burst. Power != Burst. If you have a boss that would phase every 4 sec and become invul/unable to target for a few, those classes that would be able to do good damage in that time window would be considered burst. In that case, power mesmer couldn't do good damage. Power is just power, burst is something completly different. Just as a burst heal is healing but alot of it at the same time.

Agree with this so much. I played minstrel Chrono for a long time til all the nerfs; it was easy mode. Switched to full diviner’s when it came out and realized how crappy I was at avoiding damage.
