I'm happy that I won't get them anymore since I never use them.  To each their own I suppose.
---
---
---
They had to reserve the venue. Also, it's during PAX which is happening right nearby. They simply announced it early for our convenience.
---
I'm saying they create lot of new assets every episode, and then they're never used again. They spend a lot of resources on making the game look pretty, resources they don't spend on other areas, like gameplay, which would be far more important, or rewards.
---

---
They're wasting artist talent on secondary decorations, and then other areas of the company, like the programmers, look pretty understaffed. Art needs to be used better, and the other departments need some love too.
---
&gt;but the braindead grandmaster has no right giving you the highest DPS.
---
You halfway kill yourself for more damage output and to lose heat. How is that not rightfull?
---
Nice low effort post, I really appreciate your contribution to the subreddit
---
I'm pretty sure it's rigged to complete eventually whether people donate or not, you can bet your ass on it people are gonna play with the tp first tho xD
---
Lol I would if I could but unfortunately most of my account value is account-bound :p
---
Gameplay how? What kind of gameplay are you asking for?  What is it that they're  not doing that you want them to do?
---
but why should I play? Is there anything new in the loot table? Any new boss I can clutch? What is the deal? I played this content in 2013 and following year and they have not added anything new that would keep me committed more than just 10 minutes as it is the case with the beetle race.
---
GW2 has an amazing combat system and it's getting thrown out the window for arcade minigames that consist of not using your profession skills.
---
I wrote this a few days ago, did everyone miss it? :(

**[Guild Wars 2: The Calm and the Storm - Living World Season 5 idea](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cfjxax/guild_wars_2_the_calm_and_the_storm_living_world/ )**
---
I‚Äôm glad you appreciate it! Happy to share my achievement I‚Äôm proud of with you, and I look forward to sharing many more üòä
---
Sold*.
---
Out of all the items they could've taken out, they pick probably the best thing you can get from the common section. Don't forget, there is a crafting materials bag in the BLC that gives you T5 mats in there still. This reeks of a cash grab.
---
I get what you are TRYING to say. But its not really the case here.  If this was their logic for the change, which I doubt it is, it would have been an extremely poor choice.
---
I woke up early, went to the twitch page saw they weren't streaming then realized its not august 30th.
---
It's sorted by expansion, which would be fine if they had expansion headers and sorted them alphabetically within their respective expansions. It might as well be random as it is.
---
I'm kinda sad we didn't get to see the Mordrem Guard post-HoT, or the Forged post-PoF, or the Risen post-GW2 (Okay, Siren's Landing, but they were filler, the story wasn't focused on them).
---
[Some ideas about how to handle them here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cfjxax/guild_wars_2_the_calm_and_the_storm_living_world/)
---
To time for anet to promote good gameplay in open world is long gone. They have to adjust to the lower skilled community they created.
---
&gt;Or just let PBM go
---
Why should I ask that a GM that actually has/can have some impact on playing Holosmith being played differently be completely ignored due to a very careless rework?
---
Allowing the aformentioned change would actually make the trait impactful as there are positives and negatives to it (cannot control heat passively and no heat therapy till after overheating), just as one can opt to use that one Berserker GM to offset their toughness loss in exchange for not gaining more damage/burning.
---
Yes, its "bad" now, but it doesnt -have- to be with a simple fix, and saying "just adjust" to a clunkier rotation and resource management for just average dps seems a bit silly.
---
Pretty sure it's a joke/fake account, and I'm playing along.
---
It's interesting watching the voting, which I couldn't care less about.
---
Yep.. you need to make 6.. so in other words.. 120 clovers, 600 ectos, 3000 of each charm, 3000 lucent crystals .. for starters to make all 6 gift of runes....
---
&gt;the celestial infusions look like straight garbage
---
I am happy people agree on this.
---
It's wasted because it's barely replayable. You play it once, you never look at it again.
---
We can literally see the butt crack. Which horn intern made this???
---
While some of it is scheduling purposes, I assume much of it comes from the growing community frustration over their lack of communication.
---
That male boobs... so sexeh
---
I noticed the one that sells tickets for solo-fights is one of those. Don't remember the name.
---
But I'm replaying it. That's the issue we're having here. You deny that people replay that content because you don't replay that content. I'm in the living world zones quite frequently and there are always people there. Why is it that a raid I'll never enter is some how replayable, but zones I'm in almost daily aren't replayable?
---
These runes were really something I was looking forward to. I love builds and trying new things. I have leggy armor and a healthy collection of weapons. Why on earth did they implement it this way? I don‚Äôt understand. It‚Äôs almost like they secretly want to drive their veterans away. Average players are not going for leggy runes, with so many veterans who would leaving right now, you‚Äôd expect Anet to use this as an opportunity to entice us to stay. The nail in the coffin for me.
---
Thanks! And yeah, we're the wvw guild o/
---
They're talking about the prestige skins though. Can only buy at level 100
---
Please , downvote me some more. All you elite people showing off your clout.
---
Considering basically nobody has the permanent contracts, I find it extremely unlikely that they had anything to do with anything.
---
Oh boy, you don't *just buy it*. You have to gamble for it. It is an black lion chest exclusive item.
---
1) Berserkers comes in a lot of sets but just look on TP for power, precision, and ferocity 
---
2) Weapons depend on build so check places like metabattle
---
3) Rings and such can be gotten from Orr temples depending on stats so look them up.
---
4) Same as 3
---
5) If you are running berserkers gear its Rune of Scholar and Sigil of Force/Impact
---
Damn that's pretty abysmal. Build templates can't come soon enough.
---
Oh and for a back item each crafting discipline can craft an exotic backpack that has an infusion slot that will help with fractals so I‚Äôd recommend that
---
I got excited for nothing and I have nobody to blame but myself.
---
Back to another lonely month of theory crafting based on two colors.
---
Maybe waiting for the new version of Arcdps to come out? Last is from lastest patch, no today's one.
---
Thing is, those "gemstore stuff [that] looks Cantha" have been slowly made ever since 2013. Comparatively, we had gotten very few, if any, Elonian-styled gemstore stuff before PoF.
---
So to me, I draw the opposite conclusion: the more Canthan-styled gemstore stuff we get before any Cantha expansion, implies that there is **not** any Canthan content in development.
---
Are you serious?
---
Quit riding Anet's nuts, jockstrap.
---
The files have "last modified" times on them when you're selecting which ones to download. In general, it's a good idea to check if they're after the most recent patch.
---
Thanks. I just hope the game won't crash for the meantime while waiting for a new version.
---
I've been using it all day since patch and still without any crash (raids + event and fractals).
---
Because I support a game I enjoy? Ok tough guy, keyboard warrior, supreme internet being.
---
First up:  rose quartz and powdered rose quartz are buyable/sellable on the TP.  
---
Next:  you can salvage rose quartz into powdered rose quartz.  If your mining properly, you‚Äôll have lots to salvage.
---
Also:  check your mining method.  Buy all the upgrades to your multi tool except ‚Äúreconfigure multi tool‚Äù.  Run to the meteor and mark it with 5.  Try to wait until it‚Äôs fully marked before mining, but if people are slow, just get started.  Use 1 to find a node, 2 to expose it and 3 to mine it.  Don‚Äôt use your regular mining tool.  
---
Finally:  if you have two toons stationed on top of the telescope, and griffons, and are fast, you can usually mine a meteor with both toons before it expires.  Double mining! 
---
Ps:  don‚Äôt forget to buy kralkatite from the vendor at Dragonfall and the astralarium heart vendor every day.
---
Well people demanded news, Anet gave us a date for news. They may very well have announced stuff earlier than intended due to parts of the community crying about not knowing what's next.
---
Does the new master crafter event in Lion's Arch count towards either of the "Mystic Forge Researcher" or "Mystic Benefactor" achievements?
---
Thanks for replying! I'll be sure to play with them.
---
They run an mmo with no sub fee. If people want to spend cash on cosmetics more power to them! I like that there's little you can do with cash shop to get better gear (even if you buy gold you still need to craft, run content, ect to get ascended/legendaries, and while your grinding for the stuff you'll be earning money anyway heh.
---
Oh I'm sure.  I very seriously doubt they would not release legendary runes and sigils because people didn't do this event.
---
I guess what I was wondering was how long previous events like this took and educated guesses how long this one might take.
---
The title is so missleading. Dragonbash had the same for LS S4 currencies.
---

---
This one has the totals of how many are possible: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mastery_point_unlocks
---
PoF is 130 available, 102 needed for all masteries.
---
You wont be able to tank or heal in gw2, its just not that kind of mmo. Sure in raids there are support and ‚Äútank‚Äù spots but its just for raids, and even then its about class synergy and not proper roles. 
---
Before 80 its literally just not a thing. 
---
Just pick a class you enjoy the idea of and play it. 
---
We cant recommend anything not knowing your desired playstyle because a tank built charavter would be aweful for levelling(no damage and you cant facetank in gw2 at all, even shitty mobs hit you 4-5 times and youre dead) and a healer well, you cant heal and healing yourself while dealing no damage is just not an option is it. 
---
If you tell us about what style of gameplay you enjoy(slow but strong, fast but complex, glass canon or immortal minion master, etc)
---
7th anniversary is in 4 weeks, so we will probably get that stuff in a patch in 2 weeks.
---
100% agree with this idea. I would love it if we had the same for weapons and armor as well. I hate how half the player base has 1000 useless charges while the other half is eternally sitting at 0.
---
As would anyone, but neither of those things are in the same loot tier as the makeover kit.  Did you even read my post?
---
It's the build templates that prob got bugged with the new Customize panel.
---
I know, it's called fanaticism. The only cure is a healthy does of cynicism. Quit brown nosing every time someone critiques something Anet does, you're allowed to like/enjoy something AND be critical of it.
---
i agree. it also makes them worse than bad to open for new players, so they don't get to have the fun of finding rare stuff at all.
---
Oh I'm sure it will be cheaper once it's released.  That's the price I'm really interested in.
---
I guess data-mining the recipes isn't possible?
---
no worries, glad i could spare other people wasting effort getting em
---
nice man, congrats
---
actually i really appreciate it, i was going to so you saved me the work.
---
It's really close enough to five sets.  The Corsair armour isn't quite a full six piece set, but it's pretty close and covers the most important parts.
---
PepeLaugh mods don't know.
---
I'm certainly not brown nosing, what would be the reward in that. As if Anet gives 2 licks about me. I'm just in disagreement, which I'm entitled to.
---
PvP and WvW tracks give 250 in one go.
---
Nobody cares that you're poor and can't afford things.
---
Dude being wrong on the promise bit kinda blows your whole argument out of the water here, just sayin'
---
Thanks, I hate it.

Congrats!  Nice job :)
---
How does build templates make this a non-issue? The UI is horrible, build templates wouldn't "fix" this. You'll have to go through it at least once for all builds on all chars AND you'll have to go through it again for every single change you want to make. 
---
This is something they **spent time and effort** making by the way. Not some beta shit we got at launch and never got updated.
---
It'll stay an issue till it gets worked on, build templates or not.
---
[removed]
---
the mystic clover rate is pretty good tho, I dont get your problem
---
Wait I am confused, why would someone use both?
---
Oh hey look the 9000th thread that is repeated all day and already on the top commented threads, best make my own!!!!!
---
Has arenanet ever updates the textures on an infusion or even an item before?
---
Can‚Äôt help but think about how low tes the textures on the carapace leg plates/leggings (heavy silverwastes legs) are.
---
Soooo, Zodiac Armour with the Astralaria skin...  I almost respect how hilariously and audaciously lazy this one was, haha.
---
Yea I think it's cos people think you feel for it
---
If you want to play WvW then necro is great, but you'd need PoF...
---
I want to be a sparkly slut, but I don't want that... *thing*.. on my head.
---
I had more of an issue with the way the statsets are shown on the ui than them not being in alphabetical order.  I'd rather take a drop-down with the stats shown after you've selected the set / rune. I'd take that even though they do have a functioning filter-by-stat on the tp and it somehow didn't find it's way here.
---
There are so many ways this could be done better but maybe this is just a temporary ui until build templates. I hope so. Because I don't want to see what abomination they are cooking if this is their understanding of "convenience".
---
Anyway, having done alphabetical sorting, yeah it is more complicated than one would think, but it isn't rocket science, certainly not for anet. Granted, I don't know what sort of a mess they've made of their database but there are ways to "cheat" if it really comes down to that.
---
Just use build templates
---
I TOTALLY DIDN'T THINK THIS.
---
we just need party leader system,if IM MAKING GROUP AND IM LOOKING FOR SPECIFIC CLASSES I DONT WANA BE KICKED,BCS THEY FIGURE OUT HALF WAY THEY WANA PLAY IN DIFFERENT COMPOSITION.
---
Build templates are broken for the moment, because of the patch
---
I assume something around a week.
---
So raids , right ? Literally impact about 5% of the base. And yet they do them.
---
Flawed logic. But sure!
---
the usual 60
---
I heard he is too casual now, most competitive games have become too difficult for him. He has resorted to mobile games and indie switch games. So sad that he peaked so young :(
---
LOL FFXIV UI design for swapping gear sets is a lot better than this and has it's own inventory for gear.
---
And by "new" raids and fractals you mean the 4 fractals (with 1 CM) and 4 raid wings we've gotten in the last *two years*, right?
---
What's the point of perfecting your build if there's limited challenging end game content to use it on?
---
I feel like arenanet's stance towards loot is moving even more towards a players getting worthless things 99% of the time and something that actually has value the other 1% of the time.
---
Ugh... I guess eventually I will... but who the fuck thought it made sense for one component of an armor to cost TWICE that or the armor itself? Fuckin dumbasses lol. I‚Äôm in no rush
---
You're entitled to disagreement sure, but if you tell people to piss off if they don't like it then you're gonna get called out for being a prick. That attitude helps literally no one.
---
Glad you like them! I just have too many with too little need, and I want wardrobe thingies more than anything else
---
&gt; this was super expected and understandable given that it's literally their business model
---
Ah yes, removing QOL features in order to make an extra buck is their business model.
---
Fuck off, whale.
---
7 years and the only capes you'll ever get is butt capes.
---
Quick tip when trying to equip yourself using the trading post.
---
You can do a search filter on weapons and armor to help you decide what to buy without knowing the name of the weapon or armor.
---
For example, if you want berserker stats, go to TP, select weapon type, click the filter button, and filter for :
---
1) the attributes with Power, Precision, Ferocity (with power having the higher priority)
---
2) min and max level of 80
---
3) item class of Exotic
---
This will give you all weapons that match filter. You can then choose to buy the cheapest one or buy the one with the skin you like
---
Can you get out more instead of being a gross creepy incel?
---
That would make it PERFECT (i want a "swap all to" as well).
---
I really wish they'd tell us *something*
---
The uncertainty is not doing the community any good
---
It's not for legendary gear only, any type of gear has it. It allows to swap stats on stat selectable gear as well as swapping upgrades all in the same window.
---
There are no words for this :(
---
This one isn't for swapping gear sets, Hero panel is meant for that. This one is for swapping stats and upgrades in a _single piece_ of gear.
---
They could probably reuse the system they have for wvw
---
How is a skin quality of life?
---
  
---
Nice job calling me a whale in a reply to a post which states I've never spent a gem on cosmetics, great reading comprehension chief.
---
Are you okay? Normal people don't tell other people they've never met or interacted with to fuck off.
---
Anets b team
---
I'm glad there's finally a decent skin-showing/skimpy male outfit. I approve!
---
Party leadership was cancer
---
"It seems our innovative attempt to encourage headgear use has led to a steady decline of *game* use... We will not be going back on that change. We'll just add new headgear that resembles what was removed. We'll call these ~~wigss~~... uhhh... Asuran Magitech High-Strand Headwear!!"
---
I realize there‚Äôs a smaller group of players that has a decent amount of the kits saved up, but as someone with a lot of characters, I‚Äôd rather that they made both of them common drops and removed the revive orbs instead. Those feel really bad whenever they drop from the BL chest.
---
Nice!
---
There's also a Rowboat, which is basically a 2-person canoe. The sailboat is full size, too.
---
Someone having power over the party they create was cancer, okay.
---
I guess it is less cancer that people get kicked out of the party they started by premades that wanna inv 1 more at the end of stuff.
---
Amiright?
---
Gotta milk those internet points as much as we can when the train is still running, don't we?
---
You do realize, you need 3000 of each charm with 3000 lucent crystals.. on top of 6 of each condensed might and magic, 120 clovers, 600 ectos, 300 ob shards.. and however you want to calculate 300 provisioner tokens.  The charm of brilliances alone at the current price are 2430g.
---
Eh?  You can buy and convert gems to pick up the best equipment, armor, and runes grinding can buy.  It's as pay to win as any mobile freemium game out there, just streamlined.
---
Hell yeah I'll be getting my few provisioner tokens daily which will add up quicker than you expect without breaking my wallet.
---
*No one:*
---
*Literally no one:*
---
*NO ONE:*
---
*ArenaNet devs:*
---
Yeah, I hopped aboard one of the ships at the festival today, took a seat switched to first person view and enjoyed a little cruise on the water. Sometimes it's the little things.
---
Warframe gets the same; if the game gets constant updates and new content, they *have* to prioritize the new over smoothing the old. Unfortunate, but. New stuff keeps people invested.
---
I know some people really Troll and are pain in the ass but sometime it's a good Raider in an Alt account or even is main that got kick for no fucking reason when he respect the Lfg.
---
Sometime it's not about being desperate but more about passing a message. Some Nazimander really deserve it. Those Nazimander ask for experience Dps, join has Dps ping all legendary gear. He ask for killproof but look like legendary Armor and Ring prove nothing... No he want to see 250 tokens of the boss... Try to explain that those tokens wasnt keeped for X and Y reason but that Im experience like he ask (I have arround 1500 LI on main and arround 500 on Alt account). But no that wasnt "experience"...
---
So they kick me and repost "W6 CA lf Exp dps". Damn, that's a lfg for me again Im experience and I know how to Dps this boss... I keep joining every time like I was a new players that joins saying hi Dps and pinging stuff but he didnt want me for no reason.
---
I finaly join the group with my Alt account and just says: "Hi dps, Alt btw"... We pretty much oneshot everything with me on my Alt account playing subuptimal build than me on my main and we all lose 10 minutes in Lfg...
---
Please stop being Nazimander like those guys and at least try a pull with the guys if you think he isnt experience enough.
---
The abs are quite impressive on that character.
---
Damn son, you seems to be a magnet of special Snowflake. They seems to all downvote your comments.
---
Damn, was actually considering trying FF14 but if it‚Äôs grindier than Ragnarok Online I‚Äôm fucking out lol
---
A buttcrack????? In MY safe space????????
---
ANET FIRE THIS INTERN
---
I don't get it?
---
it's not meta, but then again u don't have to go meta in this game 95% of the time.
---
it got a small buff recently
---
It is
---
Ya, my apologies for being employed and having disposable income. You should try it sometime!
---
Pay to win generally refers to getting an in game advantage over people who don't spend real money. E.g. Maple Story you'd need to spend something like $10,000 to max out your gear and do maximum damage. You can't really do this in GW2 because anyone who does endgame PVE already has full ascended.
---
I think he's referring to people who complain about it. In your case it seems you were just gambling and testing, but your post isn't a rant or complaint of any kind. You just said it's disappointing, which it is
---
Overreacting much?
---
Buy crafting materials &gt; Buy boxes from NPCs
---
The only thing this community can do is complaining. 
---
It doesn't matter what anet introduces.
---
New mount: the collection takes too long
---
New legendary upgrades: UI is shit. 
---
...
---
New content DOES NOT MEAN GEM STORE CRAP
---
You can try gw2 for free and see if you end up liking it. If you decide to purchase a the expansions DO NOT use the level up to max level scroll on your first character. The levels 1-80 work as a tutorial for the game and you will learn your character better too
---
With those rates they should add a description to the rarities:
---
Common &gt; Guaranteed junk you'll wish you never dropped
---
Uncommon &gt; Uncommon and Rare junk you'll also wish you never dropped
---
Rare &gt; Super rare junk you'll accept if you drop because it's super rare
---
Super rare &gt; Lottery-tier rarity you'll most likely never drop in your entire GW2 lifetime unless you buy thousands of boxes
---
What are you talking about?
---
Gambling is *extremely* profitable...
---
for the company
---
Yes how party leadership works in 99% of games but it was so bad in gw2, right. (lol)
---
So let's make a tl;dr of 2 systems:
---
Both have upsides and downsides
---
One has the option to be risk free of downsides for everyone (starting it yourself.)
---
One has the option to be risk free if you are 3 or more people at the given time.
---
Yea i can totally see how that is much better, thanks for the enlightenment.
---
&gt;when the leader kick the members to invite his friends
---
So don't join other groups if you don't want to and make your own? There was an easy solution back then which you can do whenever just by yourself. Now you have to make sure you are 3 people at any given time to be safe.   - Bad point
---
&gt;Even worst when the leader was actualy a really bad player and you couldnt kick him
---
How is this bad? It is his fuckin group, if you don't like it then you leave is the logical thing to begin with. Again bad point since it can be bypassed by starting your own group.
---
&gt;if you are 3, you have the vote power to kick. If you are only 2, you will have to do some politics with the others
---
Explains how utterly useless this system is.
---
Yea I feel the same, pretty disappointed
---
There's a bot that always pastes the contents of the official patch notes into [the Reddit patch note thread as a comment.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cjtoql/game_update_notes_july_30_2019/evfvrj2/)
---
I'm fine with the rewards. Just disappointed no new lore related to Ep6 finale.
---
Also, I miss the old bazaar which had enemies in it.
---
Because you're not engaging with the class's mechanic. It's like if Necro got a GM trait that refilled your shroud bar as soon as you emptied shroud, making it so you just had to wait the cooldown on shroud. Or if Weavers could take a trait that meant there were no cooldowns on attunement swapping. The point of a holosmith is to manage your heat. There should absolutely be a place for PBM, but it should not be top DPS. Top DPS should be reserved for the holo that micromanages their heat. That doesn't mean that PBM should be in the dumpster, which appears to be what ANet was thinking at least at the start of this balance patch.
---
Unfortunately, I don't really have faith that they're going to make the right changes. Like most engineer players, I don't see the point of the nerfs they did, since holo wasn't this god-tier dps build.
---
Hmm never tought on the community aspect. Now that I look back, I didn't interact much with other people while playing an MMORPG (at least recently). Any suggestions to find a group, or clan or whatever. I'm usually a loner, but it would be nice to have a group of people to talk to and organize with, since I've never had the pleasure of doing so as other people.
---
I'd say that GW2 is a great entry-point into the MMORPG genre. When I first started playing (years ago) I found the game very beginner-friendly, and from what I understand it has only gotten better in that aspect. The game is far from dead, though we are kind of in the middle of a content drought depending on who you ask, but as a new player that wouldn't matter to you anyway. 
---
And like you said, the entire base game is free to play with some restrictions (more info: [https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230165307-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Types-Free-Core-HoT-PoF](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230165307-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Types-Free-Core-HoT-PoF)) so it's not like you have much to lose trying the game out.
---
I don't blame you, first time I saw a Vial of Powerful Blood I thought it was a health potion ...
---
Sounds like one of the two common items should have gained a chance to roll makeover and hair kits, rather than them being removed.
---
I dunno, I feel like rewards are tuned appropriately for this. There's tons and TONS of unlockables for festival tokens. TONS!!!!
---
It's true that not all the rewards to everyone's tastes.  But I don't see that as a big deal. 
---
If you don't want those, you could still exchange tokens for t6 mats.
---
Ah, well if you can't play long (like me) gold ofcourse doesn't come as fast, that's kinda logical.
---
Ohh boi .....my celestial blue is getting out shined by an outfit.
---
hahahaha fuck you anet !
---
I didn't fall for your overly priced useless ascended bags, did you really think I was gonna fall for this shitty, extremely overpriced piece of crap!
---
I will keep using my exotic runes, since I already have legend armor, freeing 3 more bag slots does not equate to the fcking cost of these stupidly overpriced pieces of shit !!!!!
---
I will be keeping my gold, and making some more of the corpses of all them idiots that will fall for this shit !!!
---
On that one, I do thank you in advance for all the gold I will be making off of them muahahahahahahahha
---
Oh, forgot about it. I think of it as a mistake, cause it‚Äôs really terrible (from my point of view). 
---
Guess it‚Äôs just they haven‚Äôt made a really fit raptor skin for my taste I guess. Well, will keep waiting.
---
You're not alone XD
---
The technology isn't there yet.
---
lolwat? Yall need to chill out. If someone wants to spend 2000/whatever bucks on pixels ( who is of legal age and a consenting adult who can afford it) let them go nuts? 
---
As much as anti consumer this practice is, its not immoral lol. Is owning a expensive car immoral? and maaybe leave the slavery stuff out of it ...
---
 how is that not up to the player to decide? it being armor skins doesnt stop someone from using them all together to look the same as the outfit. it just gives more options. theres plenty of armors in the game that clearly dont go well together and you can still do it.
---
This. 
---
Just let me play with a damn bow. 
---
My main ranger doesn't even use a fucking now because it's sub par DPS for end game. Makes no damn sense
---
I think its possible to continue with the griffon after the ship, so there is room from improvement.
---
Dont play, its shit
---
It's not 2019 in Tyria though
---
Why isn't it viable to tag up an taxi players in?  Why would it just not happen?
---
I do it plenty of times.  LFG for Tarir or Gerent is leading to full maps?  I tag up and start a new one.  These events don't take a lot of players anymore, as long as you're not showing up at the very last minute, there's no problem getting a second (or third) map running.  If you're trying to join and being unable to, then there's always more people than just you in the same boat.  It just takes one person to take it upon themselves to tag up and start a new map, and then the problem is solved.
---
I mean, if they added a Wuvwuv-style map queue, and you queue up and see that you're 50th in line, does that really solve anything?  If anything, I think it'd make the problem worse for everyone who isn't in the first five spots of the queue, because people would be less inclined to go join the second map and instead just wait around and hope and pray for the queue to pop before the event ends.  And then when it doesn't, they'll come and complain on Reddit...
---
You mean basically every player actually spending money on keys that opens more than one free one per week.
---
And im still waiting for the chaos gloves since years...
---
You can't buy the outfit, its BLC RNG only. At least for now.
---
You might be able to find something [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/guildrecruitment/).
---
100% a plank
---
You're just changing one "amulet" in PvP. Basically one piece of gear, right?
---
I just can't wrap my head around how people amass 5k gold over a year or even hundreds of gold in weeks. 
---
I guess it's because I'm chronically ill and disabled. I get very tired very fast so a couple of hours of SW farming is exhausting to me. I can't understand possibly how someone can have fun sitting in RIBA for 10 hours a day.
---
Search bar and "most used first". Or fav tool.
---
Probably. To me it means I'll just never craft it though.
---
You're not seeing my point. I was specifically responding to him using the argument that as long as you can afford it, it's fine.
---
His point is that **because** he has a job it's okay to support shit practices, which is not remotely logical.
---
Pretty bothered that this change comes in so long after i've already leveled 9 characters to max but at least its in now.
---
this fuckin sucks lol
---
thank you for sharing, your ass fracture is our collective fracture
---
Makes sense because of range (and yes, guardian scepter is an anomaly).
---
If i hadnt invested in this game i would be gone. They are getting more and more about locking everything behind a paywall. And to see just how scummy it is look no further than the new star outfit. Gamble your life away trying to open a loot box that has that outfit. I really hope the USA shuts down lootboxes these predatory game companies need to diaf.
---
They could just make it not "shit" like they already have in the game with other interfaces like the PvP stat selector. But of course they consistently fail to utilise the QoL they already have.
---
Many people have pointed out oversights with the design, not just ugliness. It's mostly typical "hasn't been tested" feedback as well. A step in the right direction, but also falls short of being great.
---
I mean rangers are meant to dps at range. Why should being in melee be more DPS? For pve at least
---
Rewards being lackluster... 
---
welcome to Guild Wars 2...
---
Still less than the extractor. ;)
---
However, keep in mind that today is release day, of course the prices ate very high at the moment. Wait a few weeks and the pices will go down, that's always the case. 
---
The Endless Upgrade Extractor on the other hand won't change much.
---
And making sure your map is gone after a dc/crash for sure, with no chance to get back. Unlike before.
---
i've been saving up ectos for a couple months now so i could blow em all doing this \\o/
---
So then, just remove BLCs and BLKs, and just directly sell statuettes in the gem store?
---
Dude, we are talking about design principles. Why would searchbar be possible for pvp build and not for gear piece. Explain this.
---
Can't decide on a class, huh? There is so much to choose from, I know...

I hoped for some more rewards from the treasure hunt meta. Three kites and a mini... I mean it's nice, but I already got them last year and now I have absolutely no motivation to do the meta. That's a bit disappointing.
---
The cheapest weapon was planned. 
---
But the 25 quartz are a good idea. Will do that!
---
Daredevil makes the fight trivial - you have 3 dodges, as well as evade frames on your staff3 and staff5 (staff5 is a little easier to use between the two imo). So you can dodge all of his attacks until he moves to the center and then break his bar (e.g. Scorpion Wire, Pitfall, Elite Impact Strike). Repeat as needed.
---
Have you considered taking advantage of the rush of players looking to do boss blitz and get gold time on the lfg? I see no reason why it wont be fairly active over the course of the festival but its definitely  going to be way more active on the lfgs looking for gold for the first few days.
---
check the threads already complaining about it. we dont need 8 threads about the same, uninteresting topic.
---
Unfortunately sparkly stuff sells, so....
---
I want more armor that doesn't glow. :(
---
Yea fuck it. I'm so moving on from this game
---
And don't forget putting other people down.  You don't want to miss that one.
---
I'm glad you are having such a fun time, while also being very understanding of some frustrations of veterans. I do believe you will have a good time for a long time.
---
I noticed this on my Asura, I thought it was just me not noticing before‚Ä¶ but with this I'm not so sure anymore.
---
And celestial infusion is a big sucker punch to the uniqueness of the druid spec, bu whatever right?
---
Even after all these years, initial non f2p Champions Online character look customization is far best among any mmo. One could be anything, yet there were ingame unlocks, shop unlocks, achievement unlocks and such. What you could be was limitless, yet I saw far too many ironmans and hulks.
---
Considering the other person who replied to your question I will plug in my current [go-to website for computer builds](https://www.logicalincrements.com/) since it has a looot of different tiers based on your budget (from 240 USD to 4k+ USD). You can also change the Country at the top to have more precise prices based on where you live. I usually use it as a base and then modify a few parts here and there (like maybe taking a GPU from the tier above, taking a bit more RAM or storage HDD, etc).
---
Yeah, I guess.  That's a pretty lame second hand reward for the content though.
---
Or some actually use it right to make a unique look
---
Wait, That's illegal!
---
If you're going to be on a US server, I teach a lot of people how to play. I could spend a bit of time with you and explain to you some of the basic systems. Let me know here if you're interested, since a free to play account can't message me, unless I friend you first. But I'm sure it's something you can learn with just a little bit of time.
---
technically charr should have a chest piece to cover 6-8 boobs.
---
&gt; Yeah, I am hoping that they do away with the loot box gambles. I'd rather be able to work towards getting things like this instead of playing "What's inside the box?!"
---
You'd be better off building a time machine.
---
Because pvp build is complete already, while this window still lacks build templates integration that will have all the logical and automated buttons. As you can see though, build templates look pretty close to release themselves.
---
What kind of people does this thread attract wtf
---
Me too
---
I'd prefer a time machine, but alas my wife is worried I would accidentally wipe out the multiverse with a minor paradox cascade-failing (yay, butterfly effect!) that would push us into non-existence, so this will have to do.
---
You sir, are an angel. Thank you.
---
It's a leather plank
---
The reason for this could be a little different though.
---
The Zodiac armour was added to the gemshop in 2014 and that it was created with this specific look in mind.
---
The default look of the armour isn't really what you get with default dyes though. So removing the dye you have already on your outfit probably will not result on how the Armour looks by default which will probably anger a lot of players who bought the skin. Which also means that you would find the dye to recreate the look specifically again and then this might not be a dye that is common or available to the player.
---
Looking through the dyes, the starter dye "Stream" could work but is a bit darker than what the armour colour looks like so to be able to add dye channels and be able to give players the possibility to recreate the default look of the armour you would have to use a dye that is available to all if you change it. However, if the Stream dye would be the best fit for the "available to all" dyes then they would have to brighten it up which will make any dye applied to it brighter upsetting other players as well.
---
So however they do it they would get complaints and instead of adding this they just keep it the way they wanted it to look.
---
Dude. I'm only telling you what ANet's explicitly stated intentions are. I'm not arguing whether it was a good change for the spec.
---
Also, they recently did similar nerfs to chrono and daredevil where they removed an F skill from chrono and cut the range on daredevil's steal in half.
---
&gt; And yet you want to explain me what a roadmap is/should be... again...
---
Because you don't understand.
---
&gt; You still run in circles.
---
Because you apparently have no ability to learn.
---
&gt; If you can't discuss in a polite and mature way, this conversation is over.
---
You're the one who started the insults and rudeness pal. Don't try to pretend you have the high ground.
---
If you want to make claims about arguments not being properly made, why don't you address the fact that you consistently ignore the key point and misrepresent mine - the point that you are wrong about them providing the info that we all want. Instead you pretend like my entire post above was about defining a roadmap when instead it was almost entirely about you simply getting the facts wrong. You're not interested in a good faith discussion at all so don't even pretend.
---
So how many Provisionen tokens can you get per day now?
---
&gt;Imagine commander in PvE Meta events blocking everyone if they didnt have X amount of Dps. 
---
Imagine being called toxic for trying to make something better for the people that care and try harder.
---
I see a problem with that. In WvW you have One single map that has the queue but the PvE maps are instances of a single map so you would have to manage a queue for every single map instance that is active.
---
Then you also have the problem of how it should be managed like do players stay in this queue if they are on the same map or just the instance.
---
And I think you will make the situation worse in which players will try to get on the few "good" map instances for that event and won't bother with the map instance they are on. Which means you have a lot of players just AFKing somewhere, probably near the event itself, Scaling it up for everyone else without helping just so they might get on a map instance that probably is already over when they can join the map instance.
---
why is there items in the super-rare category that are not even worth 100 g?
---
Then stop because it's not going to happen
---
i like how we cant get swimsuits,so we just get naked girl with some sparkles XD
---
&gt; Does anyone know an Anet dev who is active on reddit that one could ping (and hope that we get heard? :( 
---
They wont reply unless you are posting some quaggan fluff shit or are praising the game
---
It's not impossible those actually were a HP potion - early game design included potions instead of healing skills.
---
I stopped playing 2 years ago bacasue my guild was casuals but super cool persons. They sucked at raids and i got bored doing them with some randoms on lfg... dont even say 'git gut' before AIDS(Raids) this game was cool casual collective game. Warframe is exelent and i still haveing fun after 4k hours...
---
This is the worst fucking thing. I can literally go through 20 blchests without a single uncommon drop, and Anet is telling me to gamble against 20+ uncommon weapons and other crap to get this? I despise black lion chests with all my heart. This new item saying - haha you will almost literally never get me. 50 chests won't guarantee you this outfit, which is an already absurd amount of money/gold. 100 chests won't. 200 chests won't. Because you can just get repeats! Isn't RNG fucking marvellous?!
---
Where did they mention that in? I thought I'd been caught up on all of this stuff.
---
Have fun!
---
Did you just say a 0.001% chance for one new Scion Weapon is 'earnable'? 
---
Dragonsblood weapons were ok Skins, but a **pain** to get. 
---
Also recycling old skins is mostly what Anet does for new Ingame-earnable weapons. The Dragon Bash skins? Recycled. The Divine Sovereign skins? Recycled. The Scion skins? Recycled ^but with sparkes^ .
---
Weaver has very few 1v1 matchups that it loses, if you aren‚Äôt getting results it‚Äôs probably you doing something wrong
---
Now that you mentioned it, back at release up until first halloween. Head gear used to have hair texture on your head, under the head piece. It was crappy looking, but it was there. But then comes halloween, and everyone now turns into agent 47, when they equip 99% of the helmets/hats.
---
Dota2 route is not possible for gw2. In dota2 ( as far as I remember, haven't touched that game in 4+years) you usually have around 9 possible drops in total in chest/crate.
---
6 of them are guaranteed if you use 6 keys. Other 3 are rng.   
---
Also, dota2 shows only drop for your first key, so after that your next keys are still gambling ( if you don't buy enough of them to get all guaranteed drops)
---
Thank for your answer, i will get the ryzen 3600 for the stability :)
---
Cosmic Britney Spears
---
just dye it in the color of the character's skin, we almost Tera boys
---
Pretty sure it will determine the future of Gw2 on that Pax event. If it flops, it's over.
---
I don‚Äôt think removal is warranted, but definitely a reduction in drop rate. Haven‚Äôt played in awhile, but I was buying quite a few chests last I did, and I‚Äôve got (IIRC) 19 total makeovers. 
---
It‚Äôs obviously a money move. Maybe they see a lot of people changing their characters, so they decided to cash in on it by removing the chest drops.
---
Thank you a lot for all you answers guys. 
---
I il buy the Ryzen 3600 since he has better performances overall and seems equal to i5 9600k for gw2. 
---
This helped me a lot to take my decision
---
&gt; There's tons and TONS of unlockables for festival tokens. TONS!!!!
---
Which most players unlocked already last year...
---
&gt;You can't even say that having equally good ingame rewards has any effect on Anet's revenue when the percentage of players who even get these rewards are low, and there is zero proof that these players somehow never spend on the gem store just because they got good ingame rewards.
---
On the contrary, I think it does have a very important effect on Anet's revenue.
---
When I had cosmetics that I wanted to earn, which could be acquired by playing the game, I was very interested in playing the game. I bought more than a few convenience items along the way, as well as expansions plus LWS episodes.
---
And then I earned the cosmetics I wanted.
---
I haven't really played or spent money on the game in months, because I have nothing I want to earn in it. In fact, my mission when I *am* playing is to make it so I never have to purchase gems again. I don't want to waste money gambling on BLC's. And some of those convenience items cost more than **entire games**.
---
You could say that I could play and make money to convert into gems and get desired cosmetics that way. And you know, I might be inclined to do that - if every gold farm that wasn't Silverwastes was still working. I would like some degree of variety.
---
If there was a larger volume of rewards doled out in a more piecemeal fashion, instead of a handful of hardcore grinds, I'd be playing way more regularly and be much happier. As it stands, I log in, do my crafting dailies, harvest my home nodes, and log out.
---
The thing is if you look at the way they reward actual in game cosmetics...it wouldn't be much an improvement to not have them bought with gems anyway.
---
Yeah you could earn a mount in game, but it would like 99% of the other fancy cosmetics have 2-3 things you do for a collection or get as a drop and then say "Alright cool now go buy X, Y, Z materials to spend hundreds of gold to finish it".
---
Anet even with their in game rewards rarely ever gives out rewards for doing content or accomplishing things. Well they do....after you pay the often several hundred gold completion fees.
---
&gt; and not giving the real amount of (new) rewards
---
ONE new backpack skin
---
I thought the same thing, but I change my mind with this theory : it's a holliday festival, a large part of people will be going few days/weeks in summer trip (dev too). If the festival was high rewardy people could being mad about this bad timing. So a long festival with low reward is the opti compromise to feel free for summer !
---
But in second hand, that doesn't help for player retention in this period....
---
It was my 2 cents theory :p
---
Yeah, that's the Queen's Gauntlet Entrance voucher salesman and is especially bad, since it means you're fully reliant on RNG drops from Boss Blitz to get enough tickets to do it.
---
I do not believe he offers different items each week. Dragon Bash had a weekly vendor which offered Season 4 Currencies, and you could buy one bundle of each per week. At the end of the week it would reset to normal. I assume it's the same here, just with Season 3 currencies.
---
I'm talking about the textures, the effect that celestial infusions should have too ;) I know that the outfit is.... an aquired taste :D it's also an outfit, so RIP fashionwars for that one anyway.
---
he did look into it. this is the result. :‚Äô(
---
this is only kinda true. First of all there are at least 2 ele builds floating around. The "more meta" build is tanky S/D weaver. The second one is the Air-burst weaver. (there's also support tempest, but idk..) Thus with these two builds you fill different roles. Tanky weaver is good on side nodes and in team fights. Has good consistent DPS, but usually lacks the burst to solo kill anybody. The Air-Burst weaver on the other hand has a strong mid range single target burst, which makes it more of a +1 class.
---
The meta build for thief is +1 roamer. The really good ones might defeat an ele in 1v1, but the average S/D thief will loose this fight / not waste time on trying to kill a tanky weaver.
---
Mesmer on the other hand can be played as condi or power DPS. Condi build is fairly sustain heavy with lots of consistent DPS and condi burst while the power build has oneshot potential on a full burst rotation.
---
Tanky weaver is fairly good at fighting condi mesmer, but one well placed burst rotation of a power mes could potentially down even a tanky weaver. Meanwhile don't try to fight a mesmer with the Air burst weaver build.
---
Must take big balls for a man wearing such a feminine outfit. Too bad, there is no space for them.
---
Tbh I see this as an improvement   over time. People were complaining that zodiak isn't dyeable? Ok, fixed next time. People were complaining that celestial infusion texture is shit? Ok,  here is the better one next time. 
---
And surely they won't update old stuff, because it is already shipped out and mostly sold. Look at it as on some kind of vertical progression.
---
what‚Äôs the bottom one?
---
No one would complain about the fucking dye color being 1% different lol
---
We can still use our infusions with other sets of armour though...
---
No, this isn't a fix to either of those things.
---
Zodiac &amp; infusion weren't outfits, they could be mixed and matched to create your own desired look. This is an outfit which **will always** look the exact same, which is shit.
---
If this had been a set of skins (like Zodiac was), not as many people would complain, since Zodiac was released 5 years ago and it's okay to buy a new better skin now.
---
Well yea, I generally agree, I was refering to the notion that Anet's revenue *decreases* if there were more/better ingame rewards.
---
Keep players happy with ingame content and they will feel happier in spending a few dollars to pay back for the good feels. Players are also more likely to spend when they don't feel like they're getting continuously upsold more things.
---
The myth that people stop spending money when they get decent ingame rewards is completely unfounded.
---
says that as he tells someone to fuck off
---
Timberline Falls loading screen always had a lady with a spear/halberd.
---
fashion wars is endgame
---
i wonder how u navigate between all of them?
---
If people complain about something give them nothing at all
---
That's because it simply is a piece of wood.
---
talk shit get hit ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
it takes up less inventory space and it calms the OCD part of my brain a bit
---
At this point you only safe inventory space at the cost of a whole lot more clicks.
---
Maybe it will be better with build templates, but Arenanet really needs to overhaul the customize window completely.
---
And I just finished getting all the tokens I need a couple weeks ago... feelsbadman
---
Imo it is better to get exotic runes and perma extractor from tp and put it in shared slot. Lege rune is such let down and it cost waay too much.
---
Warframe retextured all of its old warframes with fancy new PBR textures and constantly remasters its old areas. Gas City got remastered just a few months ago. Plains of Eidolon got an overhaul of both its reward structure and visuals. Railjack will be a huge addition for Archwing.
---
Raids are pretty much the only thing WF really abandoned.
---
My only hope is that build templates won't be exclusive feature for legendary gear
---
&gt; This is such a nonargument i don't even see the point of considering it.
---
well, I wasn't really arguing against it but tried to explain why this might not have happened yet. Having all outfits with all dye channels would be great but that wasn't the point of my comment.
---
&gt; 1% of players
---
Do you have real data on this or you are just throwing random numbers?  
---
I do own a permanent hairstyle kit and I have like 8 one time use kits sitting in my bank character because I don't have a reason to use them, so this change was good for me.  
---
Also, isn't like they removed these kits, you still have others ways to get them.
---
Why fix something when they can sell you the fix as an outfit?
---
I main necro, and can confirm I do way more damage downed XD
---
I feel so bouncy as a necro, just pop right back up again
---
In a perfect world it would be a good solution, but right now squads are the only way we have of swapping instances of the map and they function as a tool for that as much as for anything else.
---
10 for the total makeover kit and 7 for the self-style hair kit. Not a fair ratio imo, but you still have a way to get it without spending gems.
---
I was asking for the benefits of making them. Not if i should or should not craft them. But thank you tho.
---
&gt;Well yea, I generally agree, I was refering to the notion that Anet's revenue decreases if there were more/better ingame rewards.
---
I gechu. I was just using that as a springboard to make the case that you're right, it *doesn't* decrease. At least in my case, it would *increase*.
---
&gt;The myth that people stop spending money when they get decent ingame rewards is completely unfounded.
---
Yeah, I'd like to see the market research that says ingame rewards hurt profits.
---
I mean you are correct, od you have all runes that you will ever need.
---
This frees my bank space, gives me goal (I'm not a TP baron so its long term) and allows me to further enrich my gameplay. Golemancer runes in open world on my engi Asura? Maybe the one summoning flesh reaper for necro?
---
Also it's a great tool for benchmarkers.
---
That was what I thought first as well but removing the dye doesn't reset it to what the outfit was but rather what is set as a dye.
---
I found [this](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/8503/remove-dye-applies-another-color-instead-of-removing-the-dye) thread from 2017 which specifically mentions this.
---
Another thing is that when you switch gear the dyes don't switch as well which tells me that the dyes are set on your character and not per equipment piece and the default value is, as far as I can tell, the Antique Gold Dye. If you look in the screenshot above you also see that the outfit has the default dyes applied.
---
But those were actually added to the statuettes in this update.
---
I am heavily convinced it's not even close to be in the realms of the possible reasons why they did not do this yet. Obvious answer is: We haven't put the time for it because XYZ is more important. This is something a player can disagree on whether it is more or less important but it's the logical reason why Anet did not do it. I think you're reaching too far.
---
light 4 skin tone and peach ice dye are very close together. i made one tonight with this combo. however the lighting in the preview window and the lighting anywhere else in the game is totally different and never turned out how i wanted it to.
---

Once you've collected all of them however, it's not very useful. It's much harder to buy season 1 and 2 minis than the exclusives in the tickets. But, I agree. Nicer looking exclusives. Wish the tickets had a mini shuffle. And they rolled the eggs into the claim tickets via an exhange. So eggs would have a chance at nearly all minis. And could be exhanged for tickets to just buy the current cycle if you're not up for a gamble.
---
HP potions and also ENERGY potions, as skills were initially going to use ENERGY
---
That energy bar then became the endurance bar, and it went from a horizontal bar to the half circle bar we have on top of the health orb. Some texts still mention 'not enough **energy**' when referring to **endurance** and back in the first few years, some skills still had energy icon and price in their description window.
---
I am not a native speaker, but thanks.
---
There are a lot of ppl who dont care about quality snd only go for quantity. They will be happy as long as Anet throws some medicore content at them every other month. Satisfying them is the purpos of this festival.
---
maybe then you can just start to do stuff that you find fun, for having the fun, not for needing to farm it for rewards....maybe that is the idea of festivals...
---
People here are right that the counter is Extractor + Perm Bank Access + 1/2 bank tabs. Not exactly cheap. However, what that set gives you is a crazy amount of value.
---
You get a very similar effect as legendary runes and sigils, but for all your characters. Also, if you're using ascended gear you can stay swap and keep your upgrades. 
---
Extractor has other uses: Infusions come and go without constraints. Pull a rare upgrade off a drop and still salvage for ecto.
---
Perm bank Access is perhaps one of the biggest game changers out there. It's simply impossible to explain the full impact.
---
Overall... Yes expensive, but it's a more complete solution than leggies.  We'll have to see what happens with build templates.
---
Build templates are almost off the table, just hold on a little longer! Meanwhile, why don't you buy some gems to get that sweet new outfit?
---
Because who doesn't have multiple of these with no desire to use them?
---
&gt; Where did I say everything?
---

&gt; and didn't get far as **the** rewards were garbage and **the** event was boring.
---
and your sample size of maybe asking 10 ppl means nothing.
---
No
---
God forbid waiting for the recipes to get out of the RNG phase and for mats to settle down, gotta spread panic *right now*.
---
Who are you to decide what matters and what doesn't? 
---
Most of the new 'earnable' weapon skins suck, while the BLC skins are top notch obviously.
---
Its Reddit..I swear there is something toxic about the the whole thing unfortunately OP
---
Been playing for 5.5 years here, still have no idea what they are and whenever I look it up I get a moment of clarity and then get confused and lost again
---
I really like the weapons from the queen's gambit
---
It‚Äôs plain irrational. If you ask anyone it‚Äôs fairly obvious. I don‚Äôt know anyone who was spending their money on this game, for instance, when we were worried about imminent maintenance mode post LS4. Wallets close very quickly at the concept of spending on a game that no one respects, cares about nor plays.
---
And over-monetization counter-intuitively soes get noticed by people who pay when it‚Äôs egregious enough.
---
You didn't bring any sample size though.
---
It is so tempting to leech on full map. Those event maps have limit of something like 40 people, so there is pretty huge chance that you can jsut stay on map and let people come there (put it in lfg).
---
Also PSA: Don't try to join groups in LFG that have more than 25 people. Their maps are already full. Go join groups that have like 10.
---
What a Sick Post..I reported this thread, how sick can you be ask who do you hope was laid off!
---
too bad its not like the other skins where its armor skins and not just an outfit.  
---
i'd like to match other clothing with it
---
They don't give a fuck about us. If they can release anything that makes them money they're going to do it even if it devalues older content such as armor.
---
I've been saying this shit for years and I'm pleased to see more people in the community realize this.
---
It's literally a slap in the face for not only us veterans, but everybody.
---
The game is constantly bleeding player. "But I enjoy it." Is not really a compelling argument.
---
"Smoking causes cancer as proven by these 15 independent studies." "But I enjoy it!"
---
See what I mean?
---
If you don't see any activity as fun to do, then just skip it. Rewards are just a bonus, not a purpose of festival!
---
And to be honest, this festival has pretty huge variety to do. Races, adventures (2x griffon one, 1x delivery, 3x race track, Sanctum sprint, Aspect arena, and I believe one more?), gauntlet 1vs1 with bosses, boss meta rush... And then you have all the achievs, scavenger hunts, and so on. Or you can just hang out, listen to singing zephyrites, open some booze and enjoy summer...? 
---
So yes, you are missing the point of festival - to have fun. And you have to know on your own what is fun for you, don't expect us to tell it to you.
---
It's still exactly what was advertised, a dev response. I think the problem is more with people's expectations that every dev response has to be impactful.
---
I like the tag the way it is, what bothers me more is that dev responses have become so scarce over the years.
---
"They buy high-end dyes and infusions through conversion"
---
"It‚Äôs very much a direct middle finger to high-end content"
---
"As someone who owns the cele red and cele blue, I just feel straight insulted by this outfit and feel like ANet is treating me like a chump"
---
You are clearly confused.  Spending to buy gems and converting to gold to buy cele infusions is not high-end content. A "whale" will be interested in acquiring bith the infusions and the skin for collecting purposes.
---
What you seek is exclusiveness and you can't stand the idea that someone can be equally sparkly as you.
---
I 've spent thousands in GW2 and I assure you I am interested in getting the skins too, I am not in the least worried that someone else might have it or if it is a bit more common.
---
Just get what you like for your toons, enjoy it and stop being sour for other people. The only thing that is getting bad is your mood.
---
There tester is a single guy named Andy. Of course they missed it.
---
The festival is filler. Season 5 is the real meat.
---
If you wanna play, play. Otherwise, don't.
---
Yeah, I feel you. That‚Äôs what I usually go for, those cool one-offs that I can slap onto an aesthetic I already have.
---
Those new heart wings? great with dreamer, bifrost and maybe some sylvari cultural armor dyed with an array of deeper purples and reds.
---
New flame gloves? great with incinerator, and a grand solar catcher.
---
But I‚Äôm not buying anything else in the shop until in-game rewards get treated proper.
---
look it‚Äôs fine if you‚Äôre ok with a mediocre festival designed to take money out of the player base ( which, before you come at me, used to be my favorite one btw, first one I experienced too when I started playing in 2014 )
---
but is it so bad when people ask for a little more substance/quality ? they nerfed the gauntlet and made it easier for no reason other than it being somewhat challenging content on the later bosses and ofc we can‚Äôt have that. They made the loot boxes even less rewarding and didn‚Äôt even change dialogue or anything relating to Aurene becoming an Elder dragon, with half  of the festival being based around*Zephyrites*. 
---
They did not try whatsoever. It‚Äôs edited now, but the patch notes even had stuff like ‚Äúthe new storm dagger‚Äù and ‚Äúsix new haircolors and accessory colors‚Äù in them, because they literally copied the patch notes from last year and apparently didn‚Äôt really proof read them.
---
Now i cant unsee it and everytime i look at it it looks like a part of my table..
---
I think the reason someone might downvote your post is that it's a personal opinion with no value other than that.
---
It's like a survey with sample size of one. You're not providing any new data, no references, no evidence and a lot of your arguments are vague.
---
It could be summed up with: **Fix the celestial infusions!**
---
We've already had a ton of those posts and they're shorter to read than yours. The screenshot comparison was the most useful one.
---
Raid legendaries, cele red, and numerous other in-game rewards that are very clearly obtained from end-game content are being shat on by the cash shop.
---
You‚Äôre not going to find a true whale in an MMO that doesn‚Äôt play the MMO a bunch. I literally have not met this unicorn of a casual whale that people claim exists.
---
There aren‚Äôt people spending in the thousands to have their in-game rewards shat on. There, however, are people who spend in the thousands on one-off utility and QoL upgrades.
---
Sounds cool, do you have any sources of how to play that? Like streamers or youtubers? :)
---
Nice post but converting irl money to gems and straight out buying a costume via the same principle is the exact same thing.   
---
The difference being one is significantly cheaper than the other so please elaborate how is converting money to gems to buy things off the trade post different from doing the same thing on the gem store?   
---
In both cases the whale did nothing but swipe a credit card except in the infusion case the gold went into the market, which barely puts a tangible dent in anything in-game related.   
---
I sooner see your whale friends being salty their infusions aren't expensive/exclusive anymore, rather than caring about the game state &gt;.&gt; I wouldn't say a thing if they made their money in-game or got the infusions in-game which would warrant this opinion, but considering they didn't I don't see the value of this opinion.   
---
You sure they aren't simply salty because their perspective of a healthy game revolves around who's the richest/most exclusive player? Because what your describing has been the issue with the cash shop since the games inception, it's not a new thing. I find it hard to believe your whale friends suddenly out of nowhere started caring about this when the costume in question is a direct fuck you to all whales. This is about money and exclusivity, not the game state.
---
Tactical downstate

Spaceballs?
---
Whats the best way to do liadri 8 orbs?
---
Well focus on getting those earrings asap, infuse &amp; attune your rings, throw in as much AR as you can (on the wiki page you can find the cheapest combo to get 150AR). Afterwards start aiming for your armor, I think it costs about 50-70g to train your crafting to 500 if i'm correct (altho material prices are up due to event). I'd pick a set that is multi class like a Heavy berzerker(DH, Power Warrior, Revenant sortof) set or light berzerker (Temp/Weav &amp; Chrono). That way you can fit in different roles (dps or support). 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I recommend joining a guild for raiding, its a gold mine and you'll drown in ascended once you get going.
---
&gt; ALL piece have either 2 or 3 channels. All they'd have to do is add a 3rd/4th channel to each piece for the celestial part, which we know is doable from the many armor pieces with 4 channels.
---
Like adding a 4th dye channel to legendary armor?
---
Nicely done, quite impressive. Shame about that fall
---
&gt; Fixed a bug that could prevent the Choya Pinata from dropping Crystal Oasis: Hero's Choice Chests.
---
Yay! I had this happen to me just last week, twice in a row!
---
Praise Joko. I have way to many of both lying in the bank. Do you think I'm a teenage girl or what?
---
Maybe it's the black part which are leathers...
---
I'm pretty sure not converting outfits into armor skins is the thing preventing me from spending money on this game right now. 
---
Developers can make key decisions that slow down whether or not I'd spending anything to a near complete halt.  
---
GGG'S ridiculous stance on trade has caused me to dodge spending money on the game, and they will continue to see nothing until it is addressed.
---
this has been heavily and reasonably critizised every single time the pavillion was open. it's annoying, and one of the times of the year where it becomes most apparent that the mega server system was never properly or fully implemented, especially in the UI. alas it now count as an "old" system, and we all know how keen ANet is on spending any resources on those.
---
bonus round: gauntlet arenas still aren't instanced either, another very valid point of criticism.
---
Lets turn the table:
---
What kind of festival content and rewards you wouldnt find boring or garbage?
---
Give examples please.
---
It absolutely is. So give us some good fashion options as drops or rewards! That‚Äôs exactly my point.
---
&gt; TL;DR: Wildly unpopular cash shop item is even wildly unpopular amongst people who use the cash shop
---
You know, this "situation" is always the same. It gets "massive" attention when it happens but after a few days everybody seems to be okay with this. Look at the Black lion chest and when they added temporary skins, when they introduced random skins for mounts from an item and many other examples as well.
---
So, while I'm not saying you are wrong this is always the same thing, "massive" outrage and then nobody cares anymore.
---
And the thing is, when you buy those things then you are supporting those things and if that makes ArenaNet money they will keep doing it. Someone will always not like something and it is practically impossible to please everyone. Personally, I think that those "whales" are less likely to walk away from a game just because of the reason they invested a lot in the game.
---
And you know what, there is always a next, more popular item coming around that you can spend your money on.
---
Look at the mobile market and free to play games! The consensus of the gaming community wherever you look is that those microtransactions are the worst thing ever and yet, somehow, the mobile market is dominating the [globa revenue market](https://newzoo.com/insights/articles/global-games-market-reaches-137-9-billion-in-2018-mobile-games-take-half/). So either the vocal part of the community is a very small part who are against this (or the others don't care) or they actively support this.
---
So, IMO this is just another thing that blows over quickly and that if it is really that unpopular then don't buy it. You don't get better food if you constantly buy the one dish on the menu that you don't even like but always say "taste good".
---
you dont need anything from gemstore for gameplay, why wouid u farm gold for gems?
---
3000g for  runes and a further 550g per weapon.... that's kinda brutal. I have four weapons. So looking at a 5000+ spend here.
---
Short version... Look how fancy you look when you go for the legendary armors and how much afford you put into this and then stand to someone with that outfit... Yes, then you feel most rewarded.. thx you Anet!
---
&gt;\`\`  If you have a group of friends or if you join a friendly guild it makes the game much more enjoyable. \`\`
---
This is not very highlighting why MMOs are special, because it's true for any game.
---
Oh those! I saw them on my elementalist! They're fun.
---
Of course it is worth it. And fluff is good. Fluff is what fills the time between content patches. Festivals, events, mini content patches √° la side stories. All fluff, all worthwhile and important. Just because you stopped enjoying anything besides whatever specific demands you have doesn't mean Anet should stop everything and only cater to you and no one else anymore. These festivals are a huge hit with everyone who still enjoys everything the game has to offer.
---
&gt;What you seek is exclusiveness
---
No, what we (or atleast me) seek is fairness. People requested for celestial auras' textures to be updated since their inception. Not only they never went through with the request, but they made an outfit that uses a higher res celestial effect and put it as RNG BLC item to rake maximum cash. This is not fair and it shows where their priorities lie.
---
To exacerbate the matters worse, Red Celestial Infusion is among the few cosmetic auras that you need to earn in game as its account bound and bought only by the cosmic essences you get from doing 100CM. With this outfit you don't even need to play the game, just buy keys until RNG works.
---
&gt; Thats 3300g for a full Rune set.
---
3000g, 550g is the estimated price for sigils
---
&gt; The Legendary Armor is at 340g a piece right now
---
You forget opportunity costs for all the account bound stuff and collections/achievements you have to fulfill for the legendary armor.
---
&gt; You can buy any 6 you will ever need for your Legendary armor and still wont bust the price of one Legy Rune.
---
Did you really expect Legendary Runes to be cheaper in the long run than keep slotting different exotic runes? They are purely convenience items.
---
I work in escalation for a software company and this is probably it. We have old software that some of us know bits about, so we're replacing it entirely rather than going in, patching this and that, and then breaking something else entirely.
---
We're a small company though, I'd really expect someone like Anet to have their shit together here like this doesn't scream professional to me.
---
you completly missed the point. we're pissed that they said they would look into fixing the textures of the infusions ages ago and instead they've put a gemstore dyable hd "infusion" behind cash, telling once again the players doing hard content for rewards to fuck off because gemstore &gt; in game challenges.
---
I think your premise of what a "whale" is, is wrong. If you have not watched this video in it's entirety I highly suggest you do: https://youtu.be/7S-DGTBZU14?t=245
---
Ye I guess my max price for the convenience would be around 100g/e
---
I am like the sole person that likes the price of these and thinks it is perfectly reasonable.
---
REEE TYRANNY REEE CENSORSHIP REEEE COMMUNIST SNOWFLAKE WHITEKNIGHT FANBOY ANET'S DICK RIDER REEEEEEE
---
Then it must be true
---
The point is, three different sets of weapon skins and at least two sets of armor skins were available during season 4. Were they a pain to get. Some where sure. There were other weapons that were easier to make as well in the same time period. Random crafted ones that appeared between stories. And the ones you could make/get from the shinies in the world boss run as well. 
---
The point is saying there's no skins to work for in the game is a blatant falsehood and it should be contested.
---
You could have said there are some skins in the game but they're grindy and I'd not have said a word, but we're getting skins from playing regularly. Maybe they're not coming from what you want, but skins are in the game. Stellar skins and Astral Skins came in Chapter 1 of Season 4. 
---
I just don't understand why people say stuff that's wrong and then try to move the bar to justify it.   
---
But the original quote that I was responding to was this:
---
"It would be nice if they actually created some new items we could earn by playing the game."
---
And factually plenty of skins have been added to the game that we can earn by playing.
---
[You tell me.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ced50i/automatic_lfr_for_gw2_a_good_or_a_bad_idea/eu21nqg/)
---
I'm a whale myself and agree with what you said.
---
I was ready to spend some money yesterday after the patch hit, I like the new jackal skin for example, but I decided not to get anything. I don't like that they put the outfit into the RNG boxes and I want to wait what they have to present about the game's future on August 30.
---
why not both?
---
It's a direct by-product of their combat system
---
It's not even convenient, looking at that interface
---
Yeah it's called progress - and without it we would stop playing.
---
Imagine having the skins, gear and title you want. What's next? You just play for fun but without a goal - next stop will be less time spend in this game and more time in other games.
---
But those ppl that grinded hardcore titles should get some regocnition for their acheivment - maybe add a "legendary' in front of it to show you did it the hard way.
---
Search on youtube and see what fits your playstyle.
---
Well I advocate for making all content a bit for everyone (particularly raids) - but I guess I had better just quit the game instead as 99% of the content isn't for me.
---
Call me picky but... I think many ppl would be super grateful if they just took a step back overhaul/touch up some of the older skins in the game. Stuff like flame legion firey bits not being dye-able, phantom hood face, zodiac armor as you mentioned and another one that annoys me is the koda leggings trim usually always white.
---
[It's dangerous to go alone, take this!](https://thatshaman.com/tools/season5/)
---
Well, that's an entirely different issue and I absolutely agree. Shitty low res textures that never get updated are bullshit.
---
While alot of this might be true, a whale generally speaking is someone that is older and likely has a family, which means time is precious. If I can buy in game currency via the gem store to afford good gear and it will allow me to experience things in the game that would otherwise take alot of time to grind for ill do it. This is the rationale behind whales.
---
While the costumes etc is great, the ability to buy 3000 gold and then afford whatever you need when starting a new character plus a max level boost is what we aim for. We can now do all content in the game pretty much, with good gear and not spend time grinding, we can assist in leveling up a guild money wise and contribute to other people when we feel like it, a quick youtube video on your class and you can practise a rotation in the mists, bam we can now contribute and understand the class. Now we have more time to hang out with friends doing dungeons and world events while feeding the baby.
---
Buying cosmetics only goes so far.
---
This was the only thing i got disapointed at. Most of us who was there last year (and the first year) already got those, so would have been nice if there was something added to work for this year :)
---
I dont decide what matters and what not. the skins are in the game. thats simply a fact.
---
you want to degrade these skins as rewards becuase you think "they suck". so YOU are the one who wants to decide what matters and what not. not me.
---
&gt;Those are like non-factors in today's economy. I've got like 6k ectos laying around doing nothing...
---
Irrelevant, 6k ecto is roughly 1.2k gold. "ecto" is just the current form of part of your liquidity.
---
It's like saying "Gold is a non-factor in today's economy, I have 1200 of it laying around doing nothing...".
---
No, but maybe upgrade the outdated stuff? Duh..
---
People seem to forget that items like these essentially ***invalidate all the future content-reward structures for all future releases*** for the players who get them. In other words: if you get full legendary gear, you never ever again have any reason to play new content that gates them if you need them.
---
Is this good for the game, even if it focuses mostly on cosmetics and not gear? Eventually, no. For many, the carrot on the stick is what makes things "fun", not the process. So... these very ultimate, content-nullifying items *have to be **progressively overpriced***.
---
Even at the current price (3000g) and at medium farming rate (30g/hour), we're looking at measly 100 hours of farming; for a kid with 10 hours of free time each weekend day, that's, like, 5 weeks of just weekend farming with no real cash - *and they never again have to play content for runes*. Throw in another month - and you got all your sigils as well.
---
And the price will adjust down. And gold is easier and easier to get each year. So I, like... don't really get this overly dramatic reaction /shrug
---
Gw2 started as rushed game, with no proper systems for competitive gameplay at all. There were no raids, no pvp leagues, no esports. Fractals had no real reason to play them and dungeons quickly became a farm.
---
Only with HoT they added proper ranked and leagues for pvp, which they later abandoned. They addes raids, which they later abandoned. At least with wvw they are consistent, neglecting it since 2012. The hard open world bosses you mentioned before also werent there at the beginning.
---
So yeah, I find it relevant point, that gw2 was not a game for you from the start.
---
At the same time, I agree with you frustration about challenging and competitive content being neglected. Anet cheated you and me and others with HoT providing some of that only to leave us to rot. I want more content like this, just like you. But festivals are not the place to stir up drama about game being too easy. This part of the game is not a subject for challenges. Complaining about this is like going to a funeral and complaining there are no clowns there to cheer you up.
---
Yup, good post. This is what I keep saying. It doesn't matter anymore. We lost. We can't speak with our wallets anymore because they don't speak loud enough. Anet has their strategy. It's no longer important how good the actual game is. It's over Johnny, that's a wrap, stick a fork in it etc. Gaming has been going downhill because of this very problem for a long, long time and all we can do is sit here and feel sad for it, because there isn't a fucking thing we can do.
---
Honestly, quality of life stuff like stat swapping and rune/sigil swapping should have been free and available to every player.
---
I like your take on it, the way I see it, GW2 is free to play with the option to buy the game/expansions to open up more of the game. There‚Äôs no subscription fee but they need to keep the servers up somehow so they run a shop that IMO works for their model. They offer cosmetics and things that enhance your experience but don‚Äôt give you a crazy unfair advantage over players who choose not to spend money on those things. If I decide to throw them $20 a month that I would otherwise be paying in subscription just to play the game in any other MMO, and I can buy some cool stuff, that‚Äôs a major plus for me, and it simultaneously supports them and allows them to continue to pay their bills.
---
The sense of entitlement people feel when they drop thousands on an MMO of their own free will for products in game that are entirely optional is so baffling to me. There are plenty of players who play for absolutely free and other players who just throw anet a few bucks now and then and enjoy what they get out of it on their end. Nobody is forcing you to put thousands of dollars into the game, it‚Äôs great that you like to contribute and all, but don‚Äôt bitch and moan about how they released something to straight up buy that you basically poured a bunch of money into their equivalent of a gacha for. Nobody forced you to do that, it‚Äôs **not** an investment you made, it‚Äôs a gamble you tried to beat the odds of by putting a lot of money into it. You got what you wanted at a cost way beyond what it ended up actually being worth and now you‚Äôre upset? That‚Äôs bullshit. It‚Äôs like if you saw a toy in one of those quarter machines you really liked as a kid and you put all your quarters into the machine to get that toy and you were really happy you got it, and then the next day you came back and saw they had restocked the machine and it was now filled with mostly that toy you spent all your quarters on, and you saw a kid get it on his first try and started throwing a tantrum, calling the company stupid for restocking the machine with the popular toy. It‚Äôs time to grow up, don‚Äôt you think OP?
---
I'm a whale in most games I enjoy such as dota. But I dont spend alot of money at once, I spend gradually. Same in ESO and GW2. A bunch of smaller purchases that adds up to alot at the end of the month. I spend because spending a few dollars each purchase doesnt affect me.
---
I'm not here to common on your opinion of the outfit, which seems to be the main point of your post. But I'll tell you this straight out, high end players are not the only whales, and I seriously doubt they're the most whales.
---
I was a whale. Spent a lot on this game. I don't spend quite as much these days but I used. And though I'm dedicated to the casual content of the game, I'm not a raider, or WvWer, or PvPer. I'm not a dungeon runner.  Buying from the gem shop is not an exclusive perview of hard core players, or people who play high end content. Anyone who thinks so hasn't seen my guild. 
---
It's a casual guild with 400 or so players, and probably 10% spend too much in the cash shop.  It's about gambling and people who like it/are addicted to it, rather than about whether you're hard core or not.
---
If you like the game and you like buying keys (and obviously people do), then you're going to end up spending a lot on keys, and other stuff as well.
---
But the point is, there's stuff for hard core players to work for in game, because casual players are even more likely to open their wallet, because they're not going to necessarily grind out stuff.
---
Saying this is somehow the purview of hard core players is at the very least misleading.
---
If 10% of the player base is hard core and a percentage of those spent money in the cash shop, and 90% of the players are casual and they spend money in the cash shop, the odds are there are more casual whales than hard core whales, at least in regard to the content they consume.
---
yes, you are completly right and this is not the issue i had in mind.  
---
if someone posts as a dev...he is the dev even in his freetime. we can't simply say: this person doesn't work for anet.  
---
just if there are 100 posts where something gets written like: my favorite quaggan is the crazed quaggan and his rats, for me at least it is a big letdown.  
---
for example there was communication about the celestial infusion and after ben left there was apparently no one anymore who "was looking into it".  
---
now the outcry by the community because of the outfit with HD celestial textures.  
---
...that could have been prevented. lets prevent such cases in the future.
---
That is what I am upset about, them prioritizing cash over QoL and customer demands
---
no one says that, but yes
---
Yes, perma bank access is much more than just a way to transfer runes.
---
I personally barely have any duplicate gear, everything it quick access from my bank.
---
I like how adding New goals and and rewards to play for is off the table.
---
Its either grind gold to gamble, or quit
---
Imagine after 2 years of monotonous cms+t4, having something unique and prestigious to play for again
---
Lol, it's not enough that ANet wants us to spend money on lootcrates. They want us to spend money on lootcrates **and** other stuff in the gem store. Like at least when I got relatively poor drops from a large batch of crates some time ago, at least I got a few useful things like a body reset kit and hair kit. I wouldn't have bought either separately from the gem store but I put them to good use.
---
At this rate ANet's going to take out all the nice stuff that can theoretically drop from BL chests and just leave in the 0.0000001% chance of a permanent contract to get people to keep gambling.
---
I know, i just wanted them to be full legendary as they are my 3 main characters, and to get rid of all those runes and sigils in my inventory
---
Well the point is that they used to develop for this sort of thing but then changed.  
---
You're not wrong though - hence why I'm almost done with this game.
---
:)
---
Then you tank the market and get a shit ton of useless items
---
Actually I do agree with you on the part, that there **are** skins to work for, that look fairly good and are something new. 
---
The point I wanted to pressure is, that a lot of recent weapon skins are reused meshes. When they then add an amazing Weapon set like the Bioluminescent Set, I wonder why they don't put skins like that out more often (to grind for).  
---
I think the Astral/ Stellar Set was implemented perfectly, an easy achievement, that I think of as *good content*, followed by a **Non-RNG** crafting system, that utilizes map currencies and is a big Time/mat sink if you decide to grind for all of them.
---
Not quite. The game has been throwing ecto at you for sneezing the past few years. 600 ectos are a non-factor because all players who would ever consider making legendary runes will have accrued a ton of them from just playing, whereas gold is a more liquid (metaphorically) asset.
---
I just don't believe there's anything elitist about it. You should be rewarded for challenging content in a way that you aren't rewarded for easy content. That is like one of the fundamentals of gaming since the very beginning. Only when you stop doing that, literally all the hardcore players who like challenging content up and quit and you end up with a barren endgame. Which is what happened with gw2. 
---
&gt;In a perfect world everyone could play the content and get the rewards and the only difference in skill is how fast you achieve something and on what difficulty.
---
I disagree. In a perfect world some content is too difficult for some, some content too difficult for most, and there are different rewards for each tier of content based on what you are able to accomplish. This whole idea where every player should be able to complete all the content and get all the rewards baffles me. And I'm not alone there, that concept is likely what pushed away the vast majority of the raiders in gw2.
---
Thanks for sharing that link. I've spent thousands on GW2 and I am nowhere near financially well-off. I wish people would stop perpetuating that line of thinking. I quit GW2 years ago when I took $500 from my savings to convert to gems to get every mini I could, some skins, and leveling a few crafts (this was before HoT). The game limited how much gems you could buy in a month back then (not sure if they still do) so I had to go to GameStop and buy gem cards (they don't limit how many you can redeem). I couldn't afford food for the next month and it made me realize I had a problem. The way GW2 is developed, with their focus on Cash Shop goodies over actual game-content, is the reason I went to FFXIV. 
---
I've hard a rough couple years and recently found my way back to GW2 and keep finding myself dropping $100 here and there. Money I don't have... and it never lasts... This latest update reminded me of why I quit in the first place. I love this game, but their gem store is too tempting when I'm feeling depressed.
---
^ this  
---
You can literally double click any item as you used to do with legendaries to bring up the customization window
---
It‚Äôs not seeking exclusiveness wtf. All we‚Äôre saying is in order to obtain a skin, an item, etc. you should have to do sth for it. Otherwise Anet could just give us all the skins, all the items right from the start. 
---
And prestige rewards, sth small to reward people for really putting in time, maybe so desirable that they get other people to also invest more time/effort/money into the game, how are those bad ? The griffon is a prestige reward and so many people went for that, a lot of them buying gems and exchanging them for gold, and having a longterm thing in the game that motivated them to log in to the game. I‚Äôm sorry but I fail to see how that‚Äôs a bad thing.
---
Aye I suspect a majority of people are put off with raiding yet fancy having the runes. There's also a massive time gate on wvw.  
---
There's people with more money than skill and patience
---
good points
---
Elegy/Requiem armor and the New Mist shard Armor is definitely a good step in the right direction. Also, making new Outfits is fine, if it doesn't get too crazy. If they do like 5 Outfits for every new Armor Set, I'm fine with it.
---
**Armor sets are hard to make** so I appreciate them not going the 100% Outfit easy route.
---
I dont get it. The only shit Arena sells is skins and convenience items. 
---
And you people feel like THEY ARE KILLING THE GAME.
---
NO. You are just bored. Play something else.
---
and thats what you got
---
I imagine the 22 week+ timegate is a major turn off for people pursuing wvw armor.
---
All festivals in any MMO are fluff doesn't make it garbage Darkmoon Faire in WoW is fluff and releases more often, yule festival in July for LOTRO is fluff. Festivals are meant to be filler content if you don't like it don't play it simple as.
---
so for the time being, i'm better off staying in ascended armour (because i hate the look of any of the legendary armour and will transmog to my look anyway) and i can just keep buying any rune i need and overwrite the current ones with new ones without extracting them, and still save heaps of money.
---
but i do suspect this is all to make their spaghetti code work for the incoming build templates.
---
&gt;The downvote button isn‚Äôt a disagree button. Try to respect the time people put into posts, and you‚Äôll have a better frontpage. This is how it works in most communities on this site.  
---
That is absolutely not how reddit works. It *should* be, but it's not. And it's naive to think it is. This site is for regurgitating popular opinion, regardless of the sub.
---
&gt; here's people with more money than skill and patience
---
/wave
---
About the price I thought.
---
Every time they do a new legendary item, the single item or the whole set always cost around 3000g.
---
is this what we came to?
---
cuz personally i'm tired of the whole "welp the people that coded X thing are gone so we'll never do anything about it ever"
---
i get that it's annoying to deal with legacy code or whatever but it's nothing gw2 specific
---
I guess my point is, if people keep saying it long enough and loud enough in reddit, that there's nothing to work for in the game, people who don't play the game who are looking to play it and maybe they'll like it, will be getting misinformation. There are things to work for in game, quite a few things as it turns out. You may or may not like them, but that's a matter of personal taste. There are plenty of cash shop items I think are quite ugly.  I just don't want to see people who don't know get misled.
---
because some people that open a ton of chests were bitching about having too many to use.
---
yeah i guess the legendary upgrades will become more popular once build templates are out as well
---
&gt;It's not about having a reward less valuable, it's about making cash instead of fixing an issue.
---
Just like the gwamm title got a giant overhaul not long before GW2. Can you guess why? Because people would have more insentive to purchase a new game.  
---
Also how is this an issue? You can get the outfit or you don't. It's not an issue, it's a reoccuring annoying tactic used to have a quick cash grab.   
---
Working on the infusions costs money and doesn't earn money. Releasing a new outfit does earn money.
---
What matters from an economic point of view is why people spend money in aggregate but without facts / data, it's not a very useful discussion.
---
Instead, we're just discussing how it feels. Yes, it feels bad.
---
I spend money when they give me actual things to do. The main issue I have with the gemstore is simply that it's not content. The biggest spikes in revenue for GW2 come after expansions. It's clear that content is what keeps players engaged.
---
Can we discuss this AFTER the Season 5 announcement?
---
As it is, I'm sure if people keep complaining then ANet will fix the issue.
---
Finishing my 32 slot bags it is then!
---
cause i like dem skins and am a poor person who cant afford anything else but the xpacs. but i aint bitching about paywalls, you are, that has nothing to do with me
---
People rage, but in the end they pay.
---
dat Chastity belt though....
---
Yes, humans like things that are difficult to get, things that are difficult to get are usually not attainable by all. Things that take a long time to get but are easy are not fun, that's just a grind.
---
Not sure if this is referring to me or not, if it is you completely missed the point.
---
Yes and no. Difficulty having an influence on priority is perfectly sane and normal. But it's still bullshit no matter the reasons, and not hard to understand why it's frustrating to grind your arse off just to get a 1992 dial-up gif of a texture.
---
what is the best way to earn gold from this event?
---
Some type of skills have a "combo" in their description, while others have a "finisher".
---
Finishers interact with combo (I think they're all fields) to create additional effects, depending on the combination. Can be regen, group invis, aoe blind, might stacks, ...
---
Usually you don't really need to think about it, but I guess it's good to know what your profession can provide. In some dungeons for example as a thief you can put down a field and blast it with your team for a long group invis, allowing to simply walk through part of the dungeon unnoticed.
---
&gt;I still remember the time and the complaints of players who don't want to sit there for 10000 hours just chugging stuff into them.
---
Right and i'd agree with them. But then you're slapping those who did in the face. In the same way those with celestial infusions get a slap in the face now, hence the comparison.
---
Let's limit that to "some people", shall we? Then I'll happily agree.
---
Invest skill or invest time - pick one.
---
The whole point of festivals is to be distractions where you participate in the activities that are fun for you.  If you don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs fun then there is no fixing that by coming here and asking if it is ‚Äúworth it‚Äù.
---
Judging by your comments it sounds like you are looking for gold/hour type of content which you usually will only find in h‚Äôween &amp; wintersday festivals.  And those grinds (IMO) are far more boring.
---
You must not remember everyone getting kicked from instances because the party leader DCed
---
Why classic is fun for me?
---
Really just knowing the interaction exists is enough. So in the future whenever someone asks to set-up a combo you know what to do.
---
Popular things to combo are: invis and might stacks basically.
---
They went full pepega huh. Guess I'll stick to having 10-15 slots occupied by rune sets / sigils and just swap them on demand.
---
Cool, thanks!
---
i know your response is quite sarcasic, but the truth is they can't control the questions and aparently have no way on tracking on how they handle things, and that is sad af.  
---
look at the new outfit and onld celestial infusion. now people are upset. it has been said someone looks into it which now doesn't work anymore for anet. aparently there are HD textures but the "looking into it" never got documented anywhere nor did anyone ever ask back or answered to the threads which popped up over years.  
---
that situation did not get prevented in the first place...something a little bit of communication and documentation could have solved in the first place.
---
&gt;"high-end dyes"
---
You know, there are many good point people made in this trade, but this little thing makes me uncomfortable. This is exactly how people are being involved in mindless spending - you slowly start believing that there are things like "high end dyes" and that they really cost that amount of money you put into the game to get them faster. Truth is dyeing system in this game is well done and there are dozens of similar (actually similar, I know, I do my fair share of fashion wars) dyes to those you call "high-end". The difference is minuscule. But it's rare, right? Hard to get! Everyone will see how rich I am, you know? No, they won't. Nobody notices, nobody cares, only you do, you, the buyer of it. This just shows how crazy it can be when it comes to spending in MMOs.
---
Dude as long as you have stuff to do the game is great
---
To be fair, 9k gold is a fuckton of money. Even if it falls to, what, 1k in a year, it just turns from a fuckton of money to a fuckton of time AND a ton of money.
---
I'm going to get them anyway of course. But it's going to skin me alive.
---
I spent over thousand ‚Ç¨ on Gem Store stuff. I admit that I like(ed) gambling/loot boxes too much and thats my weakness. Still, loot boxes are designed to  pump money into a company. 99% of the time you won't get any worthwhile item out of them that justifies the X ‚Ç¨ spent. I see that buying them is up to the player but baiting them with shiny skins just to buy boxes is outright wrong.  
---
And imagine I put another 1000‚Ç¨ on the line and buy all the cosmetic stuff from the gemstore - I don't think 1000‚Ç¨ is enough. And don't get me started on the amount of new skins that come out every month.. no one can afford that. There is so much energy and focus by anet on the gem store its sickening.
---
That's pretty sweet
---
Atm I mostly go for stuff that are earned in game instead of bought from cash shop. Legendary crafting process is particularly rewarding and allows me to get gold without relying on others or grinding one thing for too long.
---
I absolutely agree, but I just show the reason why people thought that "thing tier higher than we have the best now, with similar functionality" will have similar % price difference to lower tier like similar example of legendary armor.
---
But for that we would need some changes. Make exotic upgrades soulbind on slotting, and create account bound ascended upgrades that you can extract without use of tools. By the way, because I assume that tou're already informed about that - can one remove legendary upgrades from gear without using extractors?
---
Lol nah I‚Äôm good. Drop rate this year seems utterly rigged. Between my friends and myself we‚Äôve opened over 120k and pretty much only received monocles and 7x chaos of lyssa from super rare category and NOTHING else. 
---
So super rare is like 1/8000 at least and it‚Äôs also rarer to get some items within that category than others.
---
Are you sure you have write permissions to the Gw2Hook folder in the addons folder.
---
Would you be happy if the reward for completing challenging content was an exclusive title? If not, why not? If you are happy, would you still be happy if alternate titles were available to purchase? (for example: challenge title 'Conqueror of X', purchase title: 'Big Spender').
---
Well said. The BLC (and all other gambling boxes) is predatory to people who have the impulse to spend money in the hopes to achieve something of higher value. Iin the case of video games, it's a perceived value where the item is of higher value than the currency spent.) It's irrelevant as to the financial status of the individual because of the predatory nature of the gambling mechanics of "loot boxes". I personally have had so much disdain for this practice that I have lost interest any many online multiplayer games that enforce these practices. It's sad, disgusting, and thoughtless. 
---
There's a reason casino's have to advertise gambling addiction and to seek help, but in the video game realm companies have gotten away with earning massive amounts of money off of vulnerable people (even kids). Just because these people are behind a computer or TV, doesn't mean they don't need gambling addiction help.  Until a large amount of players start pushing petitions to their respective governments or starting awareness campaigns, this issue will continue to exist. 
---
Thanks for reading.
---
I have, and even in squads going for gold it takes too long to complete the event, spending most of your time doing Blitz so you can get 5-6 tries at Ossa is not balanced.
---
(I'm just posting below you for visibility, sorry).  This sub-reddit has heinous downvoting habits.  
---
What tends to happen on /r/Guildwars2  is that people with concerns here get labeled as toxic, negative "whiners," and that name-calling is used as dismissive shutdowns of constructive criticism.  It's disgusting.    One person concern is another person's complaint, and it fuels insecurity and stifles of meaningful discussion.  
---
tl;dr ^ - People that are satisfied with the game do not want you discussing GW2's monetization strategies.  
---
I think the main criticism of GW2's reward system right now is that it is not fun to feel like everything in the gem-store, rather, everything in the *cash shop* is an upgrade over almost anything in-game other than legendary skins.  It isn't that the gem-store is doing anything new or "unfair," it's that it's compromising the natural progression of the reward structure of the game.  
---
So, when you ask people why they're frustrated; why they're playing things like FF XIV or PoE it's because they feel better rewarded for playing the game.  They feel that the game does a better job valuing them and monetizing them in fair, responsible ways that doesn't jeopardize their natural character/cosmetic progression.  This is one of the reasons why I play significantly less.  
---
I'll buy gems occasionally, but I don't *enjoy* buying gems.  ArenaNet's built a system where they've manipulated people into spending money and buying what 10 years ago would have been their normal rewards.  I don't want to tick people off, but they've turned a lot of players into payers (The Jimquisition) because the cash-shop offerings are *that* much better than endgame cosmetic acquisitions.This is subjective, but rather than offering cosmetic "side-grades", most of what's offered in the cash shop are cosmetic upgrades -- things that would never make it into the reward structure of the game itself.  That's horrifying.  
---
I watched Dyrus (a former progression LoL streamer) playing FF XIV yesterday drop a cool mount via a FF XIV raid.  The truth is most of the rewards that you earn from endgame PvE are vapid and forgettable except things like the celestial infusions - which is why this all hits so hard.  The argument that you can convert gold into gems isn't a particularly satisfying dynamic.  The loot tables in GW2 are bland, uninspired and empty because they just want you to take your gold/money/time and spend it in the gem-store (cash shop).
---
Just thought I''d share my experience from further down because i thought it was relevant - i basically just shared the same link as you:
---
/u/deviousdelight 
---
&gt;Thanks for sharing that link. I've spent thousands on GW2 and I am nowhere near financially well-off. I wish people would stop perpetuating that line of thinking. I quit GW2 years ago when I took $500 from my savings to convert to gems to get every mini I could, some skins, and leveling a few crafts (this was before HoT).

This latest update reminded me of why I quit in the first place. I love this game, but their gem store is too tempting when I'm feeling depressed.
---
and my reply
---
&gt; I can heavily relate to this. I have so many skins from the gem store it actually makes me shudder looking at it now. Only recently I've started watching Jim and YongYea talk about these topics openly and realized that I myself had a problem. I've been at the point - literally so many times I've lost track, where I would be calculating if I transfer $x.xx from my savings to my chequing account I could just make the ~$13.00CAD for 800 gems to get that skin! or some variation of that. And I don't have that kind of money. I actually hate how much this video reflects on GW2. The "it's only here for a limited time, grab now!" "You can't get these skins anywhere else" "Spending money should be the socially acceptable way of playing the game." the lootboxes. I bought in to ALL of it. so many times. most recently as the shimmerscale(?) or whatever
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; I'm nothing but disappointed when I look at my mount skins now. I got all 20+ of them from the gem store, the same goes for my gliders. Well, I farmed to get a 2000gem gecko skin for my springer. Wiped my material storage and cost me all my gold at the time. then felt really sad that I could have just used my debit and saved....a ridiculous amount of hours spent doing content I didn't really enjoy. I hardly play GW2 anymore because of this. All the things I want come from the gem store. All the things people oggle at and ask about how you got - it came from the gem store. Why are there no mount skins attached to any content?? Because people will log in see everyone on there shiny rabbit, or shiny outfit, or shiny weapon, and where did it come from? the gem store - welcome to gw2. we'll take your card details at the door.
---
&gt;I'm also playing FFXIV coincidentally haha Honestly, I much prefer paying $15 monthly and having [actual rewards](https://www.fadedandblurred.com/ffxiv-mounts/)
---
 for my time invested. Rewards that are really cool, and that feel rewarding to get, and that you cant just buy with your frigging card.
---
&gt;I used to do the same as you, to buy gem cards, but with maplestory back in the day and NX cash. cause that game limits how much you could spend online as well. It's actually so hard for me to break these habits, but people like you, and Jim and Yong all are helping along the way. thanks for sharing your story
---
thank you as well for speaking out on this. It really does make it easier to recognize and deal with
---
You're just not the target audience.
---
I guess most people playing it either care about achievement points or haven't experienced it before.
---
I was done with it in like 10mins and that's fine - You can just go back to something else you enjoy.
---
Well, I did the GWAMM, I did my Legendary Survivor by capturing Elite skills from Boss monsters, I did farm countless times just to get stuff for those titles.
---
I don't feel slapped in the face because I know what I invested into this. GW1 isn't as active that it really would matter there and in GW2 there are so many titles that probably no one even would know what those rarer and more difficult titles would be.
---
When Ascended gear came out it was incredible hard to get them and now it is pretty easy. That is a natural progression of a game the older it gets because more and more ways are added to get something.
---
This is like saying that you suddenly can get a car for half the price which is a "slap" in the face of everyone buying it for the full price.
---
When do you guys think the expansions will go on sale?
---
Because I don‚Äôt buy outfits and I don‚Äôt really care when I see somebody in an interesting outfit because:
---
1. I know they bought it with real money or gems they farmed for hours for.  
---
2. They didn‚Äôt mix and match gear they worked hard to obtain which is something I pride myself on even though I don‚Äôt really care that people don‚Äôt care about my armor for the most part. I did it for me, it was a personal goal.
---
What I do buy, are standalone armor skin pieces if I like them, becuase I can build my own look around that. Even then, I‚Äôm aware nobody really gives a shit. 
---
What do I care if somebody with cash to blow wants to buy something fancy? That‚Äôs their choice, how is that a slap to the face to me? I just can‚Äôt imagine caring so much about other people‚Äôs choices of paid cosmetic that I would feel like it‚Äôs a ‚Äúslap in the face.‚Äù
---
Well, wasn't that a thing ever? 
---
Also, it certainly makes sense, as those weapons scale with level, thus can be equipped since level 1, while digils have their own level requirements.
---
true but not sure how this is relevant here. I dont see the Mystic Motes/Aspects Gifts of Runes/Sigils dropped from the Satchel of Loot as a reliable way of obtaining them. And considering that the MM and MA will be craftable way below the current trading value once enough donations were made, I stopped donating crystals.
---
At currently 2.3g per satchel of loot, i doubt its worth it
---
Of course, how else would you get to stand around in major congregation areas wielding said flaming amazing kick ass sword praying the entire time that anybody will whisper you in awe over all of your super impressive virtual accomplishments.
---
DE gets the same amount of shit as anyone else, you're just not fast enough to see it before it gets removed
---
Fair points, but I would like to adress part of the 3rd one. The level of grind required for any specific reward is controlled entirely by the developer and it is not something set in stone by the laws of nature. In addition, I would like to ask this: If the option to pay to skip the grind was unavailable, would the tike investment for the grind be worth it for the majority of the playerbase to get that specific reward? If the answer is yes - I will agree that the model is fair, but if the answer is no, then the logical conclusion I would draw is that it has been artificially inflated.
---
As a side note, I'm fully aware that they need to make money, everyone has to make a living, but it falls on the management of the company to find an agreeable way to go about it with the consumers and I personally feel that they aren't currently.
---
well I still wait for the forth dye channel on my LEGENDARY cloth armor...
---
As with all microtransactions, it is the customers who are at fault, not the companies. Companies do what they've always done, try to maximize profit. It's idiots who actually buy the garbage they peddle that causes more of it to appear. They wouldn't put any resources into making outfits if people stopped buying them.
---
&gt;heavy spenders in Gw2 are always looking for signs of a dying game, and stuff like this that drives community discontent, especially in ways that make them feel like suckers 
---
They're heavy spenders in GW2, how much more of a sucker flag do you have available?
---
They were bigger at launch, but they were scaled back by about a third due to clipping issues with enclosed spaces.
---
It isn't about "exclusiveness" for *fucks* sake.  It's a symptom of the reward structure of GW2 being absolute dog shit.
---
what the fuck is going on in here on this day?
---
Oh, I don't think we both use 'elitist' in the same way. I don't think one can be "elitist" about some people enjoying being part of an elite (=&gt;elitist). Maybe you meant intolerant or something.
---
There is nothing wrong with elitism per se. It just becomes a problem if elitism defines itself by denying others.
---
Like I said, if your enjoyment of something is based on the fact that others can not have it, the problem is you, not the content.
---
We could all live happily next to each other if it weren't for that problematic exclusivity. It's not enough to get it first, it's not enough to get it under the most dire of circumstances, it's not enough to be admired and envied for it - no, it has to be unobtainable for others yet still be craved by them. It loses all its value once no one cares about it. What is a raider if not envied for his gear and skins and amazing toon, huh? Nothing. Without value.
---
With a less, uh, alarming attitude we could all play the same game in different speeds and difficulties. But with one side *defining* itself about above the rest, this becomes impossible.
---
Imagine a cook stops enjoying cooking because others can achieve what he does, it only takes them longer. You know. Perseverance vs talent.
---
Like I wrote in my conversation with the other guy: let people have their fun, it doesn't infringe on yours.
---
Except that is does, huh?
---
Has to suck.
---
I agree with the meaning of your post. I disagree with the term whale. It is dehumanising and companies use it to distance themselves from owning up to the fact they intentionally try to con people out of their money.
---
An attempt to slow players from leaving while the future of the game is uncertain and Anet are area 51 secreteve about how they plqn to keep th3 game alive
---
I still don't think there are many ppl buying 150 boss kills just to get that armor. 
---
Ppl bought some specific ones, okay, I get that. But all, mayone some have done it but I don't think too many have.
---
The idea of a tool that fills slots based on roles in a group goes entirely against the core GW2 design philosophy of "no holy trinity." To be fair, that philosophy was largely ignored with the arrival of HoT, but if they base their entire dungeon-finding tool around that it just officially confirms that a good deal of flexibility in builds and playstyles is dead, which would absolutely kill my desire to use such a tool in the first place.
---
Don't get me wrong, I like the idea of anything that shakes up the reliance on the meta, but I don't think role-based tools are any better here since the game does not, at any point, even teach you what a 'kiter' is.
---
~~Small problem with that new glider design:~~  
---
LEGENDARY DESIGN IS LEGENDARY: https://i.imgur.com/0wlFen6.jpg
---
...Okay, that actually fucks my shit up. I will NOT switch all my stats by hand, fuck that shit.
---
They're "high end" because they are expensive and rare, not because they are wildly different.  The point for most people who chase these things is to *have* them, regardless of whether they actually wind up *using* them.  It's a pretty common trait among many of the wealthy in real life as well, and God bless them for supporting the luxury economy.
---
That's the point. You need to get away that holy trinity doesn't exist in gw2. They have dropped that no holy trinity concept a long time ago.
---
&gt; dungeon-finding tool around that it just officially confirms that a good deal of flexibility in builds and playstyles is dead
---
I see where you are coming from but I think you haven't grasped the concept.
---
Each boss would have a requirement preset:
---
- This boss requires 2 heals, 2 tanks, 2 dps.
---
It does NOT matter what playstyle the dps tank or heal will have.
---
 As I already tried to explain to others this needs additional adjustments in GW2: 
---
Since the system can't autodetect what you are currently playing as every class can play evereything. (except it could if there was a system detecting attribut amounts like the automatic "equip optimal equipment" in FFXIV.)
---
In GW2 before a player queues they could select **what** they are queuing for ie. tank, heal, dps as a radial menu or something.
---
 
---
The community then will evolve to have an subconciously agreement to which role takes on which mechanic.
---
I was spending way too much money on the game via blc keys, as I wanted to prolong the life cycle of the game I like for as long as possible. At some point last year I decided to stop (when they messed the economy with concentration, nullification sigil) and after the lay-offs I was offended by the information, that they were spending my money on some other games. Anyway, there will have to be a large shift in their business model and strategy for me to regain their trust and spend for anything else then pure "must have" QoL stuff.
---
"Free" or semi free business models are fundamentally evil and not sustainable, because at the end of the day, company has to make money. Facebook is maybe the best example, where the service is free on the surface, but you pay with other things like your private data. This is why I am in favour of subscription model; you have to pay, but at least you know the game will have quality rewards in-game and not some bullshit like we have now, where an RNG based outfit is nicer and has more customisation options than the end-game legendary armour.
---
When I made a post here describing how there is an obvious problem within the company, due to decrease in rate of new content and simultaneous increase in skins and items you can buy from the gem store last year, I got downvoted to a point that I cant even post on some subs anymore. Later, what happened was the exact same thing as I was describing. Thx gw2 reddit community, and go ahead and upvote that "I drew my char" post.

Okay, so, I've been thinking about ethical monetization recently, and I'm not sure how to build a store that doesn't affect you, specifically, in a negative way. Most of what you mentioned here aren't even the predatory practices, it's just the fact that a cool thing is for sale in the shop. That might come off as critical of you, but I'm trying to understand. I don't want to design a game some day that hurts people when it can be avoided.
---
Are you arguing that offering in game items for sale at all is what triggers your purchasing addiction? Do you feel that having cool skins for sale is predatory, or do you feel that it isn't something that works for you?
---
We are seeing that with the Starborn outfit already. So Anet has no excuse to say they can't do the same for the Zodiac armor except that they can't profit as well from it as it's not a fresh new shiny outfit.
---
Its 50 times more expensive before identifiying it so thank you for your sacrifice!
---
Not gonna lie, been working on my leggy armor off and on through a couple years now and a guildie that started playing this game this year already bought it off raid sellers, having converted $$$ to gold... I mean it's their money and I'm happy they've gotten it but leaves a bitter taste on my mouth. I'm still gonna do it for the QoL but I don't think I'll have that much sense of accomplishment and pride I'd have knowing you can just pay people to do it for you for a couple hundred bucks.
---
&gt; Also, runes are a lot cheaper and take less bag space than gear (1 per runeset, but 6 per gearset).
---
They also require unlimited extractor if you don't want to continuously buy them.
---
Would be nice to have those fixed
---
That's the point, you see ecto as unrelated to gold but ecto IS a form of gold. Economically, it has a name: a liquid commodity.
---
Taxes aside, having 600 ectos is the same as having 120 gold. (andmany players do actually sell them so it doesn't take all the inventory/bank slots and because they know they can just purchase some back later if they really need more)
---
Again: economically, in a similar way, your claims is like writing:
---
"Petrol is a non-factor in today's economy, I have a lot of it"
---
which is wrong because it can also be written like that, as petrol = dollar.
---
"The US dollar is a non-factor in today's economy, I have a lot of it".
---
Even eso seems to be doing better than ever since they wemt woth the optional sub.
---
if not during [anniversary sales](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem_Store/Anniversary_Sales), then probably right after their big LS5 announcement on Aug 30
---
griffon broken
---
I used to purchase my gold using gems, because I didn't have time to grind gold with my real life job taking up much of my time. Now, I don't feel like buying anything from the gem store or with gems at all. Nothing in the game is particularly rewarding. Everything you get is just salvaged and turned into gold. It is bad enough that people consider the infinite salvage items to be a required QoL item. This game needs far better in-game rewards and far less items in the cash shop. I'm so tired of people saying 'it's just cosmetics' when the game itself has very little cosmetics to actually earn.
---
It is obvious that they design the whole game in pushing people towards the cash shop and buying gold with gems.
---
I have no problem about criticism on some of Anet cash shop practices. But your final tirade about your well-thought post unjustly downvoted is groundless. And not just because it is clearly upvoted (so, unnecessary whining, really).  
---
Your post is not well-thought. You build your entire argument on a self-appointed knowledge of whales in MMO whose entire basis is ‚ÄúI know some of these guys and they...‚Äù.  
---
This is one of the most well known fallacies of public argumentation: the notion that you have knowledge of a certain population behaviour and motives based on some anedoctal experience. ‚ÄúI know some guys‚Äù. You don‚Äôt have that knowledge, full stop. There are methods of inquiry to ‚Äúknow‚Äù how and why certain populations behave. Yours is not one of those.   
---
You could have very well developed a reasoned complaint about certain cash shop practices, and it would have been perfectly fine. Instead you made a long post claiming a knowledge you do not have, and this makes this post not a well-thought one, regardless of the fact that one can easily agree (or not) with your negative opinion on the outfit they released.
---
wrong design choice then ;)
---
I've been casually playing since Beta and had no idea this was a thing. I feel like I learn something new in this game every time I play.
---
If you are early enough, sure. But if you're that early, you're still in the "groups are forming" stage.
---
15-20 minutes before the event and...at least the last time I was consistently running AB... you're more likely to have success just spamming join and hoping than you are by tagging up and organizing.
---
Those lead times are just a rough estimate, but they're on the low side. I've gotten to AB over 30 minutes ahead of time and encountered a full main meta map but not enough people coming into my tagged up and LFGed map to have more than 5ish people per side.
---
At that point I wouldn't quit the whole game like OP but I absolutely called off the meta, or at least my commanding of my side, when we had 10 minutes to go and like 5 each at South and West...and just went back to Silverwastes for my gold that evening.
---
Legendaries have always been trash in this game. Literally, give no benefit besides "looking cool" .. waste of gold and time and very poor design overall. Legendaries are supposed to make you feel more "powerful" .. yet they literally basically have the same stats as an ascended item.
---
Not sure if it's a coincidence that I'm the same age, but I agree completely.  I started in 2018, and at first played the F2P game for a week (or two?) to be sure I liked it, before committing to buy.  I distinctly recall debating on whether I should buy Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire together (as a bundle) or just buy HoT in case I end up not liking the full game.
---
Once I got running, I obviously saw what the deal was with the gem store, and I made a conscious decision that I would restrict my spending - I chose to just do without.  I did spend a few bucks here and there, but only on account augmenting items: bank slots, character slots, shared inventory slots, and I believe I paid $$ for the Copper Fed.
---
But after that, I preserved my resources and looked wherever possible to make extra gold (though I've never farmed - all my in game gold came from working the TP or just general play) and since 6 months in to the game, I haven't spent a single real dollar in the Gem store; all of my gems are purchased with in-game gold.  
---
If I see an item that I really want, but the amount of gems required would be a strain on my in game wealth...I just say no.
---
I know that eventually I will walk away from the game, and even now, many of the items I've purchased from the gem store (gliders, mount skins) remain unused as they got replaced by other, shinier things.  To me, to spend real life currency on such items is a waste.  I recognize fully that people would spend the same money on other 'wasteful' things, and I myself have saved at least a few hundred dollars on all the games I haven't bought since Feb 2018, as I play GW2 exclusively, but that is just how I feel about it, and so I act accordingly.
---
I do not, however, feel I should be telling anyone else how to spend their time or money.  If someone wants to spend their paycheck every week in GW2, as much as I might disagree with it, freedom of choice is a thing, and if they weren't spending that money on GW2 (eg if the game was shut down) they would likely be spending the money somewhere else, like online gambling, etc.
---
So the issues discussed here are not GW2 or gaming in general, but are specific issues with people, which online games exploit; and if they were prevented from doing so, some other actor would simply step up and exploit people in their place.
---
TLDR: fix people, not the game.
---
They see the development in the community and needed to open a vent to distract them.
---
Quaggan sacrifice, Mystic and Rare Ascalonian Coins auctioned together, **mass hysteria**!
---
&gt; Legendaries are supposed to make you feel more "powerful"
---
Why?
---
Absolutely hit the nail on the head.
---
This guy actually thinks people‚Äôs who have a serious addiction problem are actually going to stop playing because of an outfit. Then he brings up RuneScape and neglects to explain that RS3 is still striving BECAUSE OF WHALES. They didn‚Äôt give a shit of the terrible choices made for the game, they‚Äôve given thousands of dollars and hours to this game. They won‚Äôt go anywhere.
---
Sorry for sharing my opinion.
---
Because worrying about things Anet isn't announcing is a thing to do on this sub.
---
Alright I‚Äôll say it, celestial stuff looks really tacky and anybody who uses that stuff has terrible fashion sense.
---
To be fair, I always though legendary armor should bring legendary upgrades included inside it.
---
Still, the game should have pushed for a stat/upgrade wardrobe long ago, would have been a far better solution than any of this.
---
Pointless weapons. Who can afford to buy them di not Need them . At least gove them a differenti skin
---
i think only the obsidian stone are and maybe charged quarte are decently cheap priced
---
Actually, some hits have been talked about there. Such things as.. Will GW2 remain elder dragon focused, effects of magic absorption on Aurene, nature of the dragons and their personality, kasmeer and jory, the fact they recognise some races being left out and that they are addressing this. It all paints a picture of where they are going, ofc not a everything but im seeing their idea of the future of gw2, loving this Q&amp;A.
---
Agree. It is a common misconception to think like the op that someone who spends large sums of money on something, even more if it's virtual goods on a videogame which many would consider a waste of money, must be a wealthy person.
---
The truth I'm afraid is very diferent. I bet that person is far from being wealthy and it's much closer to your average Joe in terms of income like it happens with casino demographics. This gets even worse when considering that many games nowadays include loot boxes that bait people with gambling tendencies.
---
I did buy BLK occasionally, unfortunately I no longer can since they fall under gambling in Belgium so now they're region locked.
---
Unfortunately Anet doesn't appear to have put any effort towards finding a solution to the issue (which they promised) instead just giving the finger to people in countries with future proof gambling laws (basically Belgium states that the rewards needs to have "value to the gambler", rather than the usual "monetary value", like in, for example the UK) and trying to milk these gambling mechanics for as long as they are able (UK's gambling commission already made it clear they they like Belgium's definition better. So just a matter of the law catching up, really).
---
It's a shame but I have a hard time supporting a company with such a skewed moral compass.
---
On top of that there's long been a trend of most effort appearing to be spent on cash shop cosmetics rather than in-game rewards. The ones that are there (eg. legendaries, of which I own a few, including legendary armour) are usually gated by a boring obnoxious grind that can mostly be skipped with gold, which can conveniently be bought with real money. Sense of pride and accomplishment right there.
---
This current item might be the straw that breaks the camel's back for many, but it's been going on for a while. The bottom line is that the game's not healthy and its monetization model isn't either.
---
I sincerely hope Anet rights the ship because I do like the game, but as it stands I've barely played during this Living World season and nothing that's come out of Anet has given me any motivation to play more. 
---
At some point I, and those like me, will simply give up and stop looking for something that doesn't appear to be forthcoming anyway. 
---
And if changes are coming (of which there is no indication), then perhaps Anet should do some of that "communication" thing. Honestly hire/beg \[DE\]Rebecca for some training on how to manage a community.
---
As a developer myself (not for GW2); Your understanding of a "Whale" is off by a good bit.
---
"Whales" aren't just "rich people who've spend thousands on the game" by far. In fact, by definition of statistics they start at people spending around 100$ per month already; money you could even invest into a game if you working at a very low end job (or even jobless in some countries). Obviously there are a cases where people spend more money less often (saw a few people spend 5-10k$ in an evening, one of them being a streamer) and people who spend more money in general (a friend worked at MOLI, the studio behind IGG's "Tales of Pirates" and there was a dude casually spending 2k$+ per month..), but those are actually very rare cases. It's core issue isn't even balanced around wealth, but most of the time psychological (gambling, coping and such) reasons. The case of someone "casually spending thousands" without being affected by those points is a pretty rare occurrence.
---
Whales also aren't "skilled" by default. They are mostly either people who don't play the gamer very effective (people around 18-25) or people who don't actually play the game all that much (because of their job, family or other things) and don't want to "waste" time grinding the time they can actually spend on the game, which is why they opt in to spend cash from said job to make up for the time they would've used to grind for something. The case of someone just throwing hundreds of dollars per month at a game he's actively (and very effectively) playing 4-6 or more hours per day at a very high level is incredible rare, because in most cases (just like in GW2 with TP flipping and the possible gold/hour ratios) those people make well enough to render it basically pointless to invest real money, outside of the already mentioned cases where psychological issues come into play. In all of those cases however, how much people spend doesn't affect how well they play the game - it just affects the perception of others in some cases. It actually even goes into both directions; There's people who spend a lot on the game, but are also very skilled already, just because they actually focus on getting better instead of just grinding - just like there's people who try to make up for skill with spend money and failing at it entirely.
---
tl;dr: Whales are pretty much never "the skilled one who just got a well paid job with no issues".
---
Yup. On Friday I get my next chest of loyalty, and the last remaining Clovers I need to make Ipos, for which I might have crafted/purchased 10-15 clovers in total; everything else came from reward track / loyalty chest.   I try to spend as little gold as possible when making my legendaries, even if that means it takes a few months.
---
That is why my next project (Ipos is my 5th leg) will be legendary armor (WvW), partly because you only need like 15 clovers per piece lol.  Been playing WvW pretty regularly for about a year and change now, so I'm about 1000 skirmish tickets short of everything I need (already have a full set of WvW ascended armor) so while I agree with what people above have said of timegating, for me it's a non-issue for at least 1 weight class set.
---
The most expensive component for me will be the T6 mats (100 each of Ancient Bone, etc), which will be far far less than these leg runes.
---
I like GW2 and the community is the friendliest, so BLC are obviously not lootboxes. How dare you. /s
---
it will not only be for legendary gear though.
---
For anyone looking at these after the patch: the first and the fifth link are the recipes -- the remaining ones got changed to random gear and armor.
---
&gt;something that isn't even announced
---
[?????????????????????](https://gfycat.com/WealthyAlertAmericancrayfish)
---
some people have 23+ armorsets across way less characers. ;)
---
People say "it's just skins, it's not pay to win", but we call it fashion wars for a reason. Skins are the endgame and when half or more of that is just cash shop bullshit, it just taints the entire experience.
---
I mean for ultimate convenience that is fair.
---
25 times\*
---
Still, OP took the fall for us.
---
it sure does look like that don't you think?
---
That and you probably don‚Äôt view it as an investment do you? That‚Äôs the thing people don‚Äôt seem to understand. Most whales view purchases as an acceptable sunken cost. You never know when an MMO will stop interesting you, or when they‚Äôll shut down, or any number of things that would cause you to stop playing. You can‚Äôt be viewing money put into MMOs as an investment, because if you do, it stops being fun. Whales don‚Äôt pay money into MMOs that they don‚Äôt think are fun.
---
When I saw someone post this in discord on tuesday my first thought was "What? they finally fixed the infusion" and I was about to go buy like 10.... how foolish of me to think they wouldnt forget in game items and just shove the real texture in the gemstore.
---
Quite the opposite. Players with mutiple sets in their inventory have a harder time making sure they swap everything correctley and equip the right items, especially seeing as many icons are very similar. Atleast thats my experience after running around with 4 different sets in my inventory on one character while being "full" legendary on another.
---
Not to mention the templates are supposed to be tied to skills and traits also, not only gear afaik.
---
You're misunderstanding the description OP gave for whales.  It wasn't that whales are hardcore players who all take part in the endgame activities.  It was that whales "often times play the game heavily and are somewhat good at it".  Whether or not they spend their time raiding or faffing about the open world is immaterial to the greater argument.
---
It also includes automaticly swapping gear from the inventory, traits and skills.
---
and you think they will make build templates work with inventory? I am sceptic as all their focus recently is on systems for legendary gearing
---
It's all very simple, you see anet wants money.
---
"in the works"
---
lots of things have been *in the works* only to be eventually modified heavily or dropped entirely.
---
Good, I have a ton of these things and nothing to do with them.
---
While I do not agree with fueling blc gambling, I personally think Anet did a good job limiting "whales" mostly to cosmetics. Want to buy best in slot gear in Runescape 3? Whale/p2w on bonds! Tbh you can max in Runescape 3 in ~2 days of play time if you whale (look up "a friend treasure hunter" on youtube). Want to be powerful in most mobile game mmos? Whale!
---
I'm glad gw2 has a gear cap so whales can only get so far when it comes to gearing.
---
A lot of whales are people who have terrible lives and play the game as a escape, they dedicate themself to the game because for them, that game is better than reality, and it requires the credit card (even if they can't afford it) so be it.
---
https://imgur.com/a/LZJ754M
---
I disagree
---
Well we have a different definition of fair :) 
---
It costs way more then a legendary armor just to save a few inventory slots, im a bit disappointed honestly, i was hoping for no more then 200g per rune,
---
This is the best advice however I‚Äôd get rid of the tactics line and replace it with defense unless you need that empower allies in a raid environment
---
&gt; So why is it bad to give people who put extra effort into the game something in return ?
---
Effort is defined by putting in work not by what height of bar one can get over.
---
For example content that you and I find to be a small but not insurmountable challenge other, such as my wife, find to be completely impossible because they lack the fine motor coordination, sharp vision, and/or reaction speeds to ever succeed.
---
What is challenging content is literally different for every single person. So to lock specific rewards (especially cosmetic ones in a game where that is the end game) is like telling a portion of the play base you can never have this cool thing deal with it. That is toxic elitism all the way.
---
TLDR: By far the best way to reward effort is grind not difficulty because difficulty is relative.
---
I buy like, $10 worth of gems 4 times a year and earn the rest in gold, myself.
---
Re edit: well you made a statement in the title. What did you expect other then downvotes.
---
Re rest: whales work differently then armchair experts think they do, more at 11. You could've mentioned how whales only stick around as long as the game is healthy and they have a base of players to interact with, although you did touch on that a bit. The rest was quite an enjoyable read.
---
Yes, so...to this I would start by saying most of what I've mentioned here **is** predatory by nature. Specifically this part:
---
&gt;I actually hate how much this video reflects on GW2. The "it's only here for a limited time, grab now!" "You can't get these skins anywhere else" "Spending money should be the socially acceptable way of playing the game." the lootboxes.
---
This all falls back to the original video linked, and gambling adiction. I know what my answer is to fix this problem. Get rid of it. It's unhealthy. It's unnecessary. From what I've experienced if a sub fee can provide so much more consistent, quality content, without these practices, then I know where I see the value for my money. Add a sub fee if that's what it takes to balance the equation. But that's only my opinion and there are so many other factors to this discussion. I'm a veteran since beta, my opinion is bias. My views on rewards are just my own, and I dont feel like the things I work towards or earn in this game are rewarding enough anymore. Everything at the endgame FOR ME always seems to fall back to the gemstore so it has pushed me away. I always played this game with a love for character customization and making a unique toon that looked badass or cute or cool and had a history of getting that look that I could share with others. To me, most of that experience nowadays leads back to the gemstore and it's driven me away. That's just my heavily opinionated, really niche 2 cents though.
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about, yeah.
---
r/cantbeunseen
---
Real, but barren.
---
Eh, I think you misunderstand build templates. What we asked for is a mechanic that allows us to dump armour sets into a limbo and automatically put them on with the press of a button. If anything, that *devalues* legendary armours.
---
If Anet just implements auto-stat-swap and calls it build templates, they'll burn.
---
i wish we could also see on lfg if there's someone blocked inside. like in red text or sth
---
Delete it if in doubt.
---
The point is that whether you actually have "globs of ectoplasm" occupying bank slots or raw gold is the same and the latter is more likely.
---
"long time players, who are the ones who are the target for legendary runes"
---
Are more likely to have gold than actual slots occupied by stacks the commodity.
---
Ectos have a pretty low gold density, it's better to have gold or stacks of MC's.
---
And even players that have never touched a single ectoplasm have easy access to them if they have gold.
---
Your claim would be totally valid if it was about laurels, fractal relics, WvW tokens, shards of glory,... Many veterans have plenty of those and it's irrelevant to them if they have a huge stock of those items, yet you can't obtain them for gold.
---
Yeah but this is an outfit and that is an infusion. You can‚Äôt mix and match armor with an outfit. The infusions allow you way more customizations. The two are night and day.
---
Lmao it's Arenaet, not us. If Arenanet bothered to keep a good relationship with their users, we wouldn't be in this situation. Prime examples of companies that do a heck of a lot of communication: Digital Extremes, Bungie, Grinding Gear, Jagex.
---
My point is Arenanet need to stop being a bunch of pussies.
---
You missed the point completely.
---
As for the gear one of the most commonly asked for parts of build templates is something like GW1s weapon sets. So that changing your build swaps everything included, and I believe including the gear is why it's taking so long to build it.
---
yesterday arc-dps build template didn't work for me for some time.
---
When WvW guild raid was over, I switched from heal-scrapper to power-scrapper.
---
So, I just quickly swapped my legendary armor stats, runes and infusions + legendary weapon + sigils with the new UI.
---
It only took something around 70 clicks now... scrolling got much more irritating, though.
---
I always wished to see the stats that the name stands for. Especially for making new builds. But I also wished for a sorted list, search feature, multi-assignment, etc...
---
Let's hope this will be included in the next patch. Then this new GUI will actually be nice. ^^
---
Sweety when something is announced it is announced with details, not teased.  It must suck to go through life with this brain
---
I'm not sure how to overcome analysis paralysis in the shop without rotating items, though.
---
Umm.. 100 gold would be way too cheap. That is only 10x the price of the most expensive rune and less than the price of the most expensive sigil.
---
I still get confused on how they stack from time to time.
---
I think op was correct.. 200/4 is 50
---
&gt;a bunch of pussies
---
ah...
---
....
---
Hm. Never mind.
---
Thank you !
---
Are you going to keep this DropBox updated with future patches?
---
Rule of thumb is: 'spam blast finisher'.
---
The rest is garbage :v
---
Sorry, but this is not how whales work, and what you're describing is not a whale. The genre of game does not change the mindset and behaviour or definition of a whale. A whale is a whale is a whale.
---
You talk about heavy spending and investments. You're confusing a whale for people with disposable income and an emotional attachment who see value and choose this game as the option for their entertainment expenditure, like someone might choose to spend money on going to a club, or a night out with friends, or a restaurant, or a hobby, painting minis etc.
---
Exalted shoulders was 6 months ago, a couple of hundred dollars on keys half a year ago is not a whale. Average that out over time, it's like what.. a gym membership, or the subscription to another mmo, maybe you even justify the spending in that regard. Whales are well and truly above and beyond this level of 'heavy' spending.
---
You're not Anet's target audience for their economic decisions, actual whales are spending every week what you spent in 6 months.
---
It's the same as mobile game whales. A whale is inherently not the things you described.
---
Your opinion is actually that of an average player. You asked around in your guild chat. That in itself should give a hint that your consensus has not come from whales.
---
I sympathize with your situation and why you feel upset is valid, but your definitions, comparisions and conclusions are incorrect.
---
What you say is true for your type of player, but they are not actually the whales.
---
No I get it, his government doesn't want online gambling especially when it could be minors.
---
He can get around that (and allot of other issues online) by simply using a VPN.
---
Yeah, my only complaint would be squeezing mystic coins further. When will this game ever get a proper tier 6 common material sink?
---
Cantha Expansion and 'Half-Life 3' confirmed!
---
I'd probably stop playing if GW2 went to a subscription model. Mainly because I hate the idea that I have to continuously supply money to them otherwise I can no longer access my account. It's why I've never found FF14 or Runescape very appealing.
---
I made two characters back in the day.   
---
A mandatory "Mithran S Arkanere", who's I always try to make look more or less the same since my Neverwinter Nights days, with an 'arcanist' type of archetype that I don't think exists anymore.
---
And then a 'behemoth' archetype that looked like giant, muscular dark-skinned maid. 
---
I also really like the "Nemesis" system. You would make your enemy using the customization system, choose their archetype, their minions, their powers and personality.   
---
And when you finally capture the Nemesis, you get to make a new one. 
---
It's a damn shame Cryptic games become so grindy and boring past level 20, because they have a ton of really good ideas neatly implemented in them.
---
Meanwhile, I can craft legendary armor for less and with more features.  Hard pass on the runes for me.  Sigils are more useful so maybe I'll get those at some point but 100% not crafting the runes.  I mean Legendary Armor is cheaper, allows swapping stats and can interchange runes.  Ever since Anet redid runes to put the bulk of the power on the sixth bonus, having anything less than 6 legendary runes is pretty worthless.  Meanwhile, having anywhere between 1 and 6 legendary armor pieces is worth.

That's the breakdown per rune and per legendary armor piece.  A legendary rune will cost you about 530g plus the karma and spirit shards.  A piece of legendary armor will cost you 437g plus the karma, spirit shards and map currency.  That's almost a 100g difference per piece or 600g difference per set.  And with legendary armor you can freely swap in runes all you want.  Some will say "well it saves on bag slots" but unless you have all possible bag slots unlocked and have all 32 slot bags, it's cheaper to upgrade a 20 slot to 32 slot OR just convert gold to gems and buy a bag slot then an 18 slot bag than it is to craft these 6 runes.
---
For some anecdotal evidence the character I have the most builds on is my guardian: WvW healing, WvW roaming, WvW burn (for fun), Raid DH, Raid Power Quickbrand, Raid Condi Quickbrand, Raid Harrier Support.  From these I use the following stat combos: Minstrels, Sinister, Dire, Marauder, Berserker, Vipers, Harriers.  I also use the following runes: Monk, Balthazar, Scholar, Durability, Renegade, Thief.  Some runes are used for multiple stat combos such as Monk but I only need 1 set since I have leggy armor.  Already having legendary armor crafting the legendary runes would save me a whopping 5 bag slots (5 not 6 since 1 set is always slotted).  If I didn't already have legendary armor then it would save me 0 bag slots and be horribly painful to swap around between my 7 gear sets.  Now, if I crafted legendary armor that saves me 600g over crafting the runes AND 31 bag slots over the 5 from the runes (it's 30, not 42 because 6 pieces of gear are always equipped and having leggy armor means I need 5 new spaces for my runes).
---
Long story short, leggy runes are less useful than leggy armor and save you less bag space and they cost more.
---
What does it matter what year it is?
---
&gt; If anything, that devalues the stat swap of legendary gear.
---
Indeed, my one concern is the chance they might have some limitation on build templates to not cut into that value.
---
Those are still images, they could still be done in two takes. Make a video.
---
"Ectoplasms are so plenty that people hardly even consider them part of their assets."
---
That's a mistake. ectoplasms are roughly 0.2g whether people count them or not.
---
"Give or take 600 ectoplasm" means "Give or take 120g" whether you like it or not
---
You can make a simple thought experiment:
---
Imagine that you have a box that is called "account" with a button "Withdraw 250 ectos".
---
Behind the scenes it will try to take 250 ecto from your bank and if it can't, it will spend your gold and get them from the TP else it will convert other liquid commodities (mc's, infusions, T6's...).
---
When you need 250 ectos for a legendary, you press the button. The fact that you are "a veteran with plenty of ecto in bank" is irrelevant.
---
Legendaries are luxury items.
---
Some bring cosmetics to it, otherwise if you dont want to wast gold and tokens and your time then yes, you will be fine with your 2 sets. AND is nothing wrong with it.
---
Hearts is only faster for ember Bay and siren's landing afaik
---
50 copper each Unidentified Object
---
He has 2 Seashells and they sell for 4 copper, so 1 Seashell = 2 copper
---
2 copper to 50 copper is 25 times
---
No.
---
Asura and sylvari can grow beards too, but each race only gets 1 extra 'facial' customization, except female humans and norn, who can't get beards, and they won't even get makeup choices as that's part of the face texture.
---
I totally understand, subscriptions are definitely not for everyone.
---
I am not into online relationships.
---
&gt;Ya‚Äôll complained that ANet only cares about their bottom line, I‚Äôm making an argument for why these kinds of cash shop items will drive away people who directly impact their bottom line.
---
they do only care about their bottom line, the problem is that they are too stupid to realise that if they spent even half the time that they waste developing and scrapping new ideas, developing content and then abandoning it, neglecting modes for years and ignoring the community on balance among countless other bad decisions, they could be making way more money than they are.
---
that's still not the point
---
i think it's some mental gymnastics people use to lie to themselves that they aren't spending hundreds, even thousands, on a video game, but they are *supporting* the game. makes it easier for people to sleep at night and makes it easier for them to justify spending money on the game
---
He makes a ton of assumptions based on the few "whales" that he says he knows which is anecdotal evidence at best.
---
And that's assuming that those players would qualify as "whales" in the first place according to anet's metrics, not the op's word, which we'll mever know.
---
Can you post a timestamped picture of your guild wars account? I really doubt you played the game much at all.
---
This desperately needs at least 4 new things:
---
* A search box at the top. 
---
* A dropdown option to choose the view of the list, adding 2 more views other than the current "full length verbose list":
---
 * A list view with just stat names, and no stats, with the ascended name in parenthesis, like "Berserker's (Zojja)".
---
 * And a icon grid view so they can be shown in less space with just the icons you can see in ascended insignia and inscriptions. For example, Berserker's/Zojja is a dragon head, and Diviner's/Steelstar is a crystal formation.  
---
 * The stats would appear in a tooltip when hovering the mouse over the items in the list and the grid. 
---
The same stat icons could be used in the amulets in the PvP panel and for trinket jewels for consistency, so when you see the dragon head you always think "Berserker/Zojja" no matter what gear you are managing: Armors, Weapons, Trinkets or PvP.
---
your stats are a lil worse than if you were less than level 80 but still its a good way to level up. its just finding people willing to take you
---
I had wanted to get some of these for my weekly BL key farmer after the update, but now I'm going to pass. Minor sigils with on-proc effects are more worth than the stat increase from blues to yellows, imo. Really hard to see any scenario where bloodbound weapons' usefulness would be worth 10x provisioner (i.e. minimum  3.5g)
---
It doesn't seem that just content-invalidating things get progressively more expensive, it's anything that potentially interest players gets more expensive and locked down behind grind of stingy amount of currencies. 
---
Yes, you get legendary armor. No, you'll have to farm your ass off by doing heart 100 times in a new map to get a new mount. 
---
Then you have to farm other hearts 100 times to get just one component for legendary trinket. Istan weapon crap-farm (that people skipped because stats were mostly useless and shitton of resources needed for each subjectively fugly skin, so it got added to 'oh you didn't want to farm for those? Now you have to!' list)
---
Then I bet when new LS gets released we'll get some new "very awkward without it" transportation mode, which will again require 250-500 of each new map currency and we'll be back to farming. Blergh :(
---
I just recently did the full map exploration with a secondary character and I was amazed at how many newer people still populate the old core game zones. The game is certainly not dead, or anything close to.
---
Just FYI: whales is not a single group with a singular mind for what they like. We classify them as whales because they spend $X and more over a lifetime. In actuality, the product team will break them down in a more granular fashion to look at how often they spend money, how much they spend per transactions, how often they buy, how sensitive they are to sales, what they buy, etc. in order to inform, prioritize, and design features that targets one group or another to do what you want them to do.
---
You‚Äôre also missing the bigger picture which is the macro economics of the game, which also directly impacts spending habits.
---
I get that you‚Äôre trying to make a logical post but this is not at all insightful in any way because this is a simple and incomplete way to look at things, and it really just sounds like you want to complain about something so you strung together some half baked ideas to support your opinion.
---
Source: worked as a product manager in mobile games.
---
The base game is free so just create an account and start downloading. Then you can see for yourself whether it is worth it to pick up one or both of the paid expansions. GW2 is still quite active so nothing lost there. 
---
Do note that GW1 and GW2 are quite different in terms of gameplay, even though they share the same world and lore.
---
I came back to it 2 years ago as a "new" player and still play it daily. It's an amazing game that will let you play at your own pace with no stress to get the best gear or such. Give it a go and see what you think. E.g. mounts from PoF-expansion was a sole reason for me feeling motivated to continue playing and running arojnd the world. Have fun and do join a guild, because it gets so much better that way even if you're not social! :)
---
Pretty active. Core game is free to play - just download and see for yourself.
---
there won't come anything back. I can tell you that right now
---
Game is still very populated and if you like the game can sink a lot of time into it. And no it is not too late. The game still gets updated regularly and the devs are still developing it further. Currently some people are mad and pissed at ArenaNet for various things but that shouldn't concern you that much because you basically have everything ahead of you.
---
By the way You can try the game for free.
---
Matchmaker accidentally put a bronze team against an AT team? LOL
---
A very good initiative. Hopefully the feedback will be heard and in some way reflected upon. Good luck! :)
---
That's a very fair point, seems well thought of.
---
How brave of you
---
First of all, start with fair prices. We're talking real microtransactions, 0.50‚Ç¨, 1‚Ç¨, 2‚Ç¨ stuff. What we have now is not worth the value in any way whatsoever. Then cater to the whole playerbase, not just millionaires and gambling addicts.
---
If someone is spending too much money on the game, then your customer has a problem, and it will eventually affect you. It's like letting someone get drunk at your bar, he's gonna make a scene sooner or later, and the money you made off him won't be worth that much when that happens.
---
If the customer spends a lot of money, but on social activities, then it's an entirely different thing. Like, consumable toys to throw a party and stuff like that. The spent money should correlate with the amount of people having fun with the purchase.
---
Personally, I think monthly 5‚Ç¨ bundles where you get a few skins, boosters, party stuff, etc would be great. Separately, everything in the bundle could be 10‚Ç¨-15‚Ç¨, so you'd be encouraged to subscribe.
---
And of course, the game needs it fair share of rewards as well. You shouldn't lock core aesthetic customization behind a paywall, and your monetization should focus on details, additions to the core, that make it more valuable. Core mounts having incomplete dye channels is disgraceful.
---
In the end, your game could do great with just box sales anyway, so there's no excuse for unethical monetization.
---
If your not happy. Move on. Simples. It's a game. Not wife and children.
---
I think the main problem with GW (and maybe MMOs in general) and monetization is that from all I've seen players WANT Anet to profit from the game so that they'll keep putting resources towards it and keep the game alive. Unlike games like Fortnite and Overwatch people have more invested (time-wise, emotionally, socially etc) in MMORPGs and at the same time there is more to do and more rewards to earn than in those other types of games.
---
In Overwatch for example you have 2 things to care about: your rank and skins (voicelines, emotes etc as well but most of the focus is on skins). In Guild Wars you have mounts and mount skins, weapon and armor skins, outfits, legendary weapons/armor/trinkets/back pieces/sigils &amp; runes, minis, gliders, hair styles and character customization, utility items ranging from character slots to permanent bank contracts and probably a whole bunch more that I'm forgetting. Basically the games have major differences especially in terms of rewards, and yet the monetization is very similar and it doesn't quite work. 
---
For me that's the heart of the problem: we can bitch and moan about monetization but it's here to stay, and to me the best case scenario is that MMOs in general and Anet in particular look over the way they make money off this game and figure out a way to balance it. Ironically, since I left WoW partly because of it, I actually think offering the \*option\* of subscriptions could be a good business model: we know subs work for making money (just ask Blizzard) and as long as it's presented as more of an option (ie: pay monthly and get gems and cosmetics and maybe even a bit of gold) rather than a requirement to play the game I think that might actually work pretty well. I'd probably sign up for it, if the rewards were good enough and the fee was reasonable. But I'm open to any change in the current model because right now they're exploiting and bleeding the majority of their player base dry, both in terms of real life money and in game effort/investment, and it doesn't seem sustainable in the long term.
---
I don't get it, what's special about the starborn outfit?  Is it not just another gaudy expensive costume?
---
That's not even being a problem of being poor....I would gladly pay 700gems for that outfit, but I'm not gonna waste 700gems on keys to maybe get it.
---
&gt; You are more than welcome to simply scroll past.
---
Right back at you.
---
Close the game and not play for the rest of the day cause map is full. Done, no more gaming today.
---
nice try arena net.
---
Not even. Celestial is smack bang in the middle of the core stats.
---
I can tell from your dungeon and raid post that you actually understand the game about as well as you speak English
---
Nice try Jaw
---
God, please no. Please don't let Anet have build templates artificially suck just to prop up legendary. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umDr0mPuyQc
---
All I am saying is: They are not transparent enough and all we get glimpses of is how their focus lies on legendary gearing in an obvious preparation for build templates. I am not saying anything more. Yes you can disput it, but I am not here to defend an oppinion.
---
Gosh I love the griffon. This is amazing, thank you for sharing!
---
First, thanks for taking the time to read and comment!
---
This is actually the mindset of a lot of players, and it works as a double edged sword in a way. One, it shows a side of the community that can accept the state of the game as it is, and it shows a mentality of "whatever content comes or doesn't come, I'll continue to play" or so to speak for the most part. A kind of 'Loyal Player', if you will.
---
The second, and 'edged' part of this, comes as an acknowledgement that yes, there are in fact a large number of players who are not happy/discontent with the current state of the game. In fact, the number of those players are so large, that so many complaints and issues are being brought to the light, that a portion of the community who is tired of hearing about it had to come out with their own response: "Accept it or move on."
---
I hope that makes sense, and thanks again for commenting!
---
Being that fundamentally unrealistic about how the world works actually explains so much about these types of posts.
---
lol I wish I worked for them. Then I could tell you what might be coming down the pipe.
---
Wait, you can get dragonsblood weapons with festival tokens??
---
I can agree that there are merits to GW2's system, but rarely does actually playing the game 'feel' rewarding. As strange as it seems, that frequently matters a lot more than something actually being rewarding. There is nothing exciting about getting your 35th blue glove that you will turn into 2 silk.
---
This goes hand-in-hand with how easy most of the game is, but even difficult content like raids and fractals barely reward you. Getting liquid gold or items you can sell for gold is boring. Getting an interesting drop or doing an interesting/difficult challenge to get a good or cool item is much better for rewards.
---
I just got my first one too! It's Caladbolg Rosa. I know it's a really easy one to get but I'm still happy with it. First time I ever had to grind Bloodstone dust too because usually i toss it. Now I'll be making bricks every time I hit 250.
---
&gt;They are doing ANOTHER festival with new updates for recent events
---
99% copy-past from last year with nothing meaningful to do
---
Dragon Bash already has been completely boring and pointless. Press 50x f here, run 5 times in a circle there, kill 50 trash mobs there, collect currency number 5827, open another set of unrewarding lootbags that cost you more than you get. 
---
This doesn't feel like a good use of my time. Nothing that is immersive or moves the game/story forwards. Maybe it's fun when you see it the first time, but for veterans it's just dull and repetitive.
---
And here I am, still sad there's no griffon races in the game :(.
---
https://twitter.com/that_shaman/status/1156288515132538886?s=21
---
The biggest S5 teaser so far....
---
Except hes starting a conversation and reflecting on why he feels the post is important.
---
You are just whining.
---
Dus you play the new raid wing, answer the damn question. Also another festival, or should I say the same crap which was okay the first time it came around but starts to become boring. I don't need 3 liadri the concealing dark minis. There is literally no reason to revisit any of the festival stuff.
---
Not much difference between dislike and disagree.
---
I am sorry that someone has hurt you. It will get better dw.
---
[deleted]
---
IMO, we have no reason to think they will be. Build templates are about storing trait and equipment configurations and choices, not about saving inventory.
---
Of course they don't have any incentive to go through client demands and work on QoL when they can sell gems instead. Who cares when there is money amiright?
---
And the fact that they had no plans is even worse and speaks for their prioritization, don't you think?
---
If it wasn't clear from this post, I am actually criticizing the very things you listed as acceptable behavior from Anet, because they are not.
---
No idea where you are getting this information, but it is simply wrong. If you think about it, players with full legendary will probably have less of a use for build templates. They have 7/8 pieces of equipment plus upgrades to worry about. People who have no legendary equipment have at least twice that many pieces of equipment and upgrades to worry about. And some have three or four times as many. That is a lot of inventory to manage.
---
Which situation? ArenaNet develops a product we use the product... that‚Äôs it imagine google engineer replying to consumers about business decisions ... that‚Äôs unheard of but make the game a product and is expected?
---
I am not sure what this has to do with what I said.
---
this is exactly what i wanted to do as well and the main reason i even posted this
---
Well yeah, i understand, it's just a matter of convenience which is something very subjective, maybe for some people is still good even at this price.
---
For me 3000g for this is still way too much considering is also locked on only one character at time.
---
It's almost the same price I paid for a permanent bank access contract that (at least for me) as an immense value compared to this.
---
Oh sorry my dude I actually didn‚Äôt see that last question. My phone cut it off. To be fair I have not had the chance as we were moving and I didn‚Äôt have internet for a while. Looks really cool though.
---
I mean, people will spend $500 on a couple golf clubs and it's nothing, $500 isn't that much to spend on a hobby if you can afford it.
---
" I see most of my concernes coming from the fear of not knowing if there is a Future for gw2 "
---
Thanks for taking the time to read and comment. I've noted your response!
---
In regards to the comment: Yes, this right here seems to be the biggest concern among players at the moment. High level, challenging, end game content to keep players intrigued. Along with the continuation of releasing content on a schedule to give players a reason to keep playing. Guaranteed new content.
---
Thanks again!
---
Thanks!
---
NEW MOUNT?!? :O ERHMAGERD!!!!
---
If I may ask, what moved you from GW2 to FFXIV personally?
---
To add to it:
---
For those who don't get the connection, every elite spec has its own rune. [Superior Rune of the Firebrand](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Superior_Rune_of_the_Firebrand) for example, but of course this does not confirm new specs, it's a speculation.
---
Just letting you know that I didn‚Äôt just start recently. It was my wife. I‚Äôve been here for a bit lol. I‚Äôm really not trying to be confrontational or anything.
---
Holosmith? Necro? Revenant?
---
So go and enjoy the game with your wife?
---
Obviously people are going to vent on reddit, we haven't just started playing a week ago.
---
There's no point of asking questions because we were doing it for years and didnt get a single answer. ANet knows what we want to know, know what we want in the game and just decided to ignore it.
---
Marketing at its best. "Hey uh, I have his object and its properties are so illusive that no one can identify it so far. Yet despite its rarity I'm willing to part with one of these for *only* 50 copper. I'm taking a risk here because it might be worth a fortune"
---
&gt;i think it's some mental gymnastics people use to lie to themselves that they aren't spending hundreds, even thousands, on a video game, but they are supporting the game.
---
Jim Sterling covered this extensively. Companies purposely try to create a perception in their fanbase of "supporting" the game, in order to make excessive spending feel acceptable.
---
Now, there's obviously nothing wrong with a company wanting to make money. But the logic should be "We deliver a satisfying product, they buy it" and not: "Make the playerbase feel guilty into paying a tax."
---
There are a few exceptions to this. Such as in the anime industry, more obscure anime (Not animated by Toei) depend on the bluray sales to pay a lot of their underpaid animators and profit from that anime. Blurays are what decide if an anime succeeds or dies.
---
However, ArenaNet is not some obscure anime. They are the triple-A gaming industry with a steady income. They were so damn successful that they were able to employ over 400 people until just a few months ago. Yes, it's true they had layoffs, but that was due to company politics, not profits.
---
Apologies, I didn't see this comment earlier. Thanks for the input!
---
What content in FFXIV drove you to move to that game from GW2?
---
There's a lot of love for the game...except you will hardly see much of it here, since the salty ones (and there's A LOT of these sheeple) will always instantly downvote people with differing views and people not following the current circlejerk train.
---
He wasn't insulting anyone, homie. I'm not hear to throw a dictionary at you, but ignorant and susceptible does not inherently mean stupid and weak.
---
Also, he didn't say anything about not liking people who buy BLCs -- he's one of them. Understanding context is important.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm kinda having similar thoughts. I love all the news I get from this sub but all the negativity is just really turning me off and leaving a bad taste in my mouth. And as much as I know it‚Äôs just a vocal minority (and I honestly do believe that there is some vote manipulation and stuff going on) it still feels bad man.
---
Are you sure?
---
Yeah, it's hopeful speculation, you don't have to ping me.
---
I'm not that hopeful, since ANet has proven that they can screw pretty much anything up.
---
at least he trys something. better then those "look i made my first legendary" threads. because they aren't tiring at all. ayy.
---
It replicates the effect of in-game earnable infusions, as well as another outfit from the gemstore (Zodiac). The problem here is that for years there have been requests for being able to dye those infusions, which Anet said they couldn't; yet this one is completely dyable.
---
To add insult to injury, it's a completely random drop from lootboxes.
---
No, you get recipes for Dragonsblood weapons using laurels. This means that laurels tend to be more valuable (I still haven't gotten all the weapon recipes) and so the festivals are a better currency as a result.
---
Imagine a GW2 where every game mode gets the attention that the story gets. Wonderfull.
---
On the one hand I get the frustration. On the other hand... Suppose a television series is on it's 3rd season and everybody is talking about how great that season is. This discussion gets you interested in the series but you first have to watch the first 2 seasons to get to that amazing 3rd season. There's really no way around that. The same for a 3rd book in a book series or what have you. Or try watching Avengers Endgame without having seen any previous films in the MCU. It's possible but it's hardly the most enjoyable it can be. That's simply the nature of storytelling in multiple instalments.
---
Tbf they weren't in the wallet until some point after the last festival. Internally the currency and an inventory item might different things.  
---
The inventory item is consumed to make the currency item
---
I really enjoyed POE for a while (last I played sometime around 2017?) but as I went with higher and higher difficulty, it got very much like Diablo 3 where you had to dodge everything or get 1 shot.
---
Funny thing though, is that's what GW2 PvP feels like these days.  Maybe my time in this game will make me a better PoE player lol.
---
Rangers used to have whales until Anet took them away... :(
---
Who sat in a boardroom, saw this, and said "yep, that's ready for release"  :thumbsup:   ?
---
Just baffling.
---
Exactly! The bad illustrations I can understand, because maybe they are from early stages of the game, but all the images stacked together making non sense at all... UGH!
---
Life leech, even if you down a necro, they can down you with it and then win the down fight because their down skill #1 steals hp.
---
then you literally didnt get the point of gw2. nothing in this game is grindworthy except skins. you get everything else for peanuts. You can get a full set of ascended armor and weapons for the price of the dyes im wearing.
---
Saving trait and equipment configurations is the least. I see no reason why not to go bigger, especially considering how long it took them to finally tackle the issue. After 7+ years I demand nothing less but the ultra deluxe 9000 edition, director's cut. If the build templates don't, at a minimum, store my shit, allow me to **insta** swap *everything*, take care of my shares portfolio and walk my dog for me, I'm going to be disappointed.
---
For real though, trait and equipment configurations are the least. Not having to carry around 26 pieces of gear however doesn't sound *that* unreasonable, does it?
---
I am a veteran player, since beta.  I play a great deal and have experienced almost all content in the game in all game modes.
---
My concern.  That Anet knows clearly that a vocal group does not speak for all, especially all those many players who are too busy playing GW2 and having fun to post in forums.
---
I am one of those the vocal group does not represent.  Sure, I don't agree 100% with everything and I'd make some changes.  But all in all, I believe Anet is doing a wonderful job in making a game I love to play.  Sure, there is content in the game I don't enjoy, but I appreciate others enjoy it so it's good.  And for myself, the sheer amount of content in the game that I enjoy is quite amazing.
---
If I was to offer a suggestion for them beyond small things, it would be to create a polling system inside the game itself.  A place where developers can get real feedback from players about content.  If it's inside the game, actual real players would see it instead of the small amounts on forums.   Additionally, they could easily sort the responses based on how active the account and how long the account has been active.
---
In other words, they could see responses from true veteran players and make choices based on real responses instead of listening to vocal minorities who like to complain on forums.
---
It's often common when Anet listens to one such group, you'll have another group become vocal because they dislike the changes.  It's difficult to see through the "noise" of the Internet.  In game polling and feedback would be much better.
---
Forums can still serve a purpose, but when you need true representative polling, it's not reliable.
---
An additional benefit is when it's polling that's kept private, it helps prevent hive mind mentality which is also common on forums.
---
Gotcha. So you‚Äôre just saying that because you can currently buy a lot of the Laurel merchant stuff with festival tokens, you now have spare laurels to buy dragonsblood recipes etc. 
---
I did just buy all the home nodes with 1 day of farming so that felt great. I never got a chance to get them cuz I quit 4-5 years ago and just returned this year.
---
That's besides the point. I don't use any infusions myself but they are an end game reward nonetheless.
---
The situation where almost every hardcore player is very unsatisfied with the game. The situation where even a fluff post from arenanet is upvoted to heaven because everyone is so thirsty for any information from them. The situation where the forums are a disgusting place of censorship and clinical restrictions. Have you been paying attention at all? They suck at communication.
---
I really like the idea of an optional sub. I don't know if ESO has perfected it, but they've certainly shown it's a possible viable strategy.
---
I will never be this good on a griffon.
---
I'm really really really hoping not, been so excited to see a full in game implementation and then had this errant thought, "you know, I'd still finish my legendary stuff but some people might not feel the need if templates are as good as I hope, I hope they don't limit templates in some way to not cut into the value/drive for legendary"
---
It's paranoia, it's gotta be, please let it be.
---
It's really not that hard. You can craft using materials that are either on your character or in the bank.
---
Equipping things accessible to you is not rocket science.
---
The biggest thing for me is that there are very few MICRO transactions. a 25$ digital skin for your griffon is ANYTHING but "micro" that is the cost of a good meal ffs.
---
The problem with this game is that all the great things about it go to waste.
---
The combat can‚Äôt shine when the content doesn‚Äôt take advantage of it.
---
Adding cool mounts is moot when there‚Äôs no good reason to explore the world.
---
Not having to ‚Äúgrind for gear‚Äù is such an overrated ‚Äúfeature‚Äù because they didn‚Äôt replace the gear grind with anything. Other games with gear grinds also have cosmetics, secrets, and achievements, and have more variety in that regard.
---
Before archtypes there were free builds. One had to pick certain skills and passive at first but you could retcon freely later, being able to pick from any synergy was priceless. Wearing whatever you want anytime was also so much fun. A true heaven for pvp buids. Then f2p came and locked everyone on archtypes. Nemesis system is also great. Items were there just for the stats or cosmetic unlocks. I remember farming vampires for a very rare hip sash for weeks but it was never boring. True fashion wars.
---
It‚Äôs so true... my ADHD makes me especially susceptible to models like this and I‚Äôm not proud of it. That little burst of dopamine every time you open a box is so addictive.
---
Ah I missed the 2 quantity. Thanks for the explanation!
---
I think the greater problem is with runes.
---
With a Sigil, you make one, you are sorta set. You can make good use out of a sigil. But what are you going to do with 1 rune? Or 3? That barely helps because you need a full set to really do anything to justify changing runes. This means you basically have to carry 5/6 of every other set anyways. That doesn't help you with anything. If anything it's even more micromanagement. You really need 6 (or 7 if you really love 61)
---
So at least for sigils, each completed sigil is a hint of progression. Runes? Well sorry, but your princess is in another castle.
---
This is the deceptive nature of "horizontal progression". People mix it up with having to do "no progression" but that would not be fun. People need a goal to work towards to, people want a goal to work towards to. And why should everyone be entitled to get these qol items for basically doing nothing? Of course you grind!
---
These items are so ridicilously optional that the only thing they give you is the feeling of being "done" forever with that gear.
---
Sort of like this I heard, roughly "FF14's Shadowbringers is the best MMO story ever, but you have to slog through 200 hours to get to it"
---
That was satisfying to watch
---
[Let me copy-paste why personal wish list.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cbgkxl/if_you_could_change_something_in_general_pve_what/etfcjbv/)
---
&gt; Secondly I'd quadruple all future content. Meaning that this one big, amazing story-instanced based bossfight will stay as it is, then it'll get a five-man version of it, and that five-man version will get a repeatable challenge mote. And the entire thing gets a leaderboard slapped on it.
---
That's going to be an all-around treatment. Raids will get an easier and a harder difficulty plus leaderboards, Fractals also get leaderboards, and yes, also a CM-level difficulty. Which is weird, since Fractals technically are already difficulty-based. But let's face it, T4 isn't "very hard" and T1 "very easy". So while they don't get a fifth tier, they get their repeatable CMs as a challenge for hardcores.
---
&gt;It's important, that rewards will scale. Meaning highest difficulty drops more currency, lower difficulties drop less currency, but all difficulties drop the same currency, meaning everything will be achieveable for everyone. It's just going to take longer and be more of a grueling grind if you suck at the game, versus being good at the game.
---
Yes, casuals will not be excluded and treated like scum, and hardcores will be entertained with additional and challenging content! Le gasp! We can co-exist! Fuck everyone who doesn't agree.
---
&gt;That, of course, will require more work per content. But it's recyclable content! Instead of creating one piece of content for one part of the community and then creating another piece of content for another part of content, boring one group and alienating the other, all content will be more or less viable for every part of the playerbase, turning every release into a release for everyone, upping the de-facto release cadence for everyone. Suddenly even the single father can enjoy raids and the hardcore raider can enjoy Living World updates. And all by only fiddling with numbers and, who knows, maybe one or two additional mechanics per encounter, instead of having to create entirely new encounters for whatever part of the playerbase they're trying to cater to with it.
---
&gt;Boom, bliss and joy for everyone except for the saltiest of bastards.
---
You're jelly about my penny collection :\^)
---
All I know is that: considering the runes and sigils have no effect, the cost for the entire set cannot be justified to anyone, unless they are in a position where they have a ton of gold laying around with no real use.
---
It's all in the wrist! Also, you de-talon your griffon to alter its behavior much like declawing a cat. One beginner mistake is keeping it attached to a spike in the ground by a chain like you see with some dogs - this severely limits the maximum flight distance and altitude you can attain!
---
Yeah, and invulnerability means you can throw all their orbs at once before it runs out, if you're quick enough. It's what finally worked for me last year.
---
You need to use the "mount ability 1" keybind (or ability 2 I forget which is dive and which is pull up). They behave differently than the engage ability (just pressing the 1 key) and back (s)
---
I spend over thousand of dollars on this game. I used to buy fair amount of gems monthly just because I wanted to support the game, even if there was nothing in value or interesting to buy for them. Even when I had plenty of gems left out from previous months I would still buy a pack, just to show my support for the developers. Little to say I haven't spend a single penny for over a year now. I stopped playing the game in January, and refuse to come back, because I don't see any change in Anets treatment of this game. The pure fact they thought they can play us fools with small team throwing up one map and story release every 5 month  while they make mobile game is enough for me to not want to come back. But yet here I am still, watching content creators on streams, reading reddit. I guess you can leave GW2 but GW2 won't leave you.
---
To be honest, I feel that players made this to themselves. It is players who try to convert all the sheer content into "best gold per hour" content, and repeat it again and again, until they get (surprisingly!) bored. The design of the game actively tries to fight this, and people are again and again aggressive when devs fix just another thing so people can't run it 12 hours a day. (Or they can, but it won't be so lucrative anymore, so it is no option for those anyways)
---
Also, people fully expect for game to challenge them automatically, instead of creating their own challenges (for example taking off the armor, or not use mounts to traverse maps, or to play as level 50 in lvl 80 map, etc...). Game is jsut big sandbox for everyone, but what gets built is fully dependent on players. And this is what practically all the whiners in last months, that I read (and not only there but in mmorpg sphere in general), do miss. Then it is obvious that another game will be fun as it has different rules, but I think that in the end, it will result into the same situation, as mindset of players did not changed.
---
&gt; I know because I spend way more time playing the game than I do reading people whine relentlessly on Reddit.
---
Clearly.
---
Thank you for this great comment!
---
I will say myself, I enjoy GW2 to the point of me quitting absolutely no time soon. And I agree with pretty much everything you said. I might not use all content, but the fact that it is there for someone else makes me happy. I love to see an engaging community, and others enjoying the same game I do.
---
My main reason for this thread is that over the past few months, I've seen a large rise in complaints/concerns about the current state of the game. And as someone who is currently pretty happy with it, that makes me sad. So I want to do whatever part I can to try to help these other players who want themselves to want to play GW2, but cannot overcome these concerns/lack of content/whatever the case may be. And you're right, I don't think it's at all the majority of the players feeling this way, but I think it's enough that everyone should acknowledge whats going on.
---
If that makes sense. Thanks again! I've noted the sections of the comment related to the thread.
---
Really?  I think I did all the side stories.  If so, another point I'd add, make them very visible!  Put it in that annoying spot on the right top side of the screen.  But give the option for a player to dismiss it without answering.  That is, players shouldn't be forced to surveys and feedback polls.  If they were, they'd just answer without reading to get back to actually playing.  
---
And the polls should be completely in game not a link to the web where you can troll the responses and you lose the level of feedback.
---
There should also be polls after completion of certain content.  Example is living world.  After it's done, the poll should appear in that right top spot but only after the living world is done.  It doesn't make sense for people to answer questions on content they haven't done.  However, they could have general polls from time to time for that too, to understand better why some people dislike raids, WvW, etc.  Lots of opportunities :)
---
And it can be so customized.  That is people who don't raid or raid very infrequently might get a poll about why and what changes would make them try.  That poll would not be seen by raiders.  Rather they'd get a feedback for a particular raid after it's done the 1st time and again perhaps after the 10th time to see if it changed.
---
So on for all kinds of content.
---
You do realise some people like set suits of armour, right?
---
Large part of the reason why it works in eso is the qol/ bonuses it comes with. Like bag space, free access to all the dlc except the expansions and premium currency every month. All the dlc there cost money so paying a sub fee is cheaper than buying all the dlc and expansions.
---
The only way i could see anet implement an optional sub fee would be if it was a gem plan with the added bonus of unlocking all the lw episodes for free (good for the new players who havent unlocked them). But generally speaking the fact that the content in gw2 is free makes it not as worthy of a pricetag as in other mmos.
---
They drop relatively frequently from what I've seen. And the lucent crystals you can definitely get a lot of just doing salvages. Even as far as getting the satchel, selling the motes and aspects to rebuy more crystals to trade in if you just want the materials for other legendaries seems not terrible. Who knows you may also get lucky and just straight up get a gift too.
---
Angry much?  If you met someone with 500 hours studying physics and someone with 5k hours studying physics wouldn't the person who has 5k hours be more knowledgeable and have more thought out opinions on the subject?  Same with gaming.  The people with tons and tons of hours in this game have most likely seen all the content and been there for highs and lows.  They've experienced what has worked and what hasn't.  Maybe stop with all the Veteran hate circle jerking and actually listen to them.
---
The fact of the matter is this game has a lot of stuff to do if you are new(er) and next to nothing to do if you are a veteran.  The only real caveat to that is if you are a veteran who enjoys farming open world content and pressing 1 because, apparently, that's fun for some people.
---
There is achievement for it, and they have the sign on their heads, and I think that one even got ingame mail to check them out. And you got the achiev after picking one answer.
---
However as I said, it was pretty small scale, like single question twice and that's it. And no open writeup, just choosing one of four answers, so nothing that would be really enough so far. But tiny stuff is more than no stuff.
---
&gt; A great way to start off a story is with a lie. There's no way you 
---
"went to work on the GWAMM title immediately" on day one or anywhere close to day one. Titles didn't exist til April 2006 and one couldn't achieve GWAMM (hell, the max titles title didn't go past rank 3 for a while, August 23 2007) til after the release of Nightfall. Hard mode didn't exist til 2007 (announced on April 5), skill hunter and cartographer weren't titles til 2007, etc. LDoA wasn't a title for a while, either. 99% of people just used autoclickers for IAH, but some used a mapping technique to get it more quickly.
---
Obviously i didn't start on it immediatly as in i created a character, hopped into the game and went straight for titles. I meant as soon as i hit max, finished all content which was fairly quick, i then went for titles that all contributed towards GWAMM. 
---
&gt; Imagine a title being obtained by letting your character die tens of thousands of times to mobs to level them up. People who didn't have stable connections for 8 hours could never achieve the title. How is this prestigious?
---
You really didn't have to be active for 8 hours on end. 2 Hours would do just fine to gain some XP. How was it prestigious? Because it required dedication.
---
&gt; It went from being skill capping with boosts or an early cantha quest and logging if something goes wrong to doing a dungeon. That's barely a change.
---
The change was about 18 hours in difference and from a high risk to basically no risk. Stop talking as if you've experienced both because clearly you haven't.
---
&gt; Anet absolutely did not destroy exclusiveness in gw1. You're just writing this from what appears to be the PoV of someone who has read rants on and off by people who casually played the game.
---
I'm writing this from someone who's gone true the entire process of obtaining the titles when they were at their maximum length. Why is it you assume i'm having a PoV casual when you're the one who's dead wrong about everything we've discussed?
---
You're right, none of this is new. And I don't mean for it to be anticipated that way. The purpose of this post was to bring players thoughts and concerns, or even praises into one thread that I can summarize, rather than scour the entirety of this subreddit, going back who knows how far. So we all know that there's always going to be someone who is unhappy about something. The perfect game doesn't exist, and it never will. Because you can't please 100%. But there has been enough attention brought up in recent months that a lot of players want their voices to be heard, and they have that right. The devs and the player based community should be as close to one unit as possible. I personally find the lack of communication between Anet and the players quiet disturbing.
---
Thank you for commenting!
---
This should be the video we show people when they ask about GW2 mounts.
---
This!! Yes if you jumped in like a year ago or two you have a lot to do. Those who have been around at launch are out f things to do.
---
Anyone else have a lot of trouble dodging the knockback from Qadim The Peerless at times?
---
Feels like it's slightly delayed compared to the telegraph to me, but that might just be my ping or that I'm very dumb.
---
Most people that want to start alts are already neck-deep in tomes by that point.
---
5 more years to get this fixed before these might be relevant.
---
Honestly if ANet hates the idea of a decent scalable leveling weapon, I don't know why they even added them in instead of keeping this constantly gutted (i.e. useless) version of them.  
---
It's like "here you can use this car as you level, oh but we only offer a Lambhorghini Diablo so if you want that it's going to cost 250 provisioners"
---
5 years later, "ok now we offer affordable cars but they don't come with wheels"
---
Of course if they were free yeah, I‚Äôd get them so I could feel good about myself for being leggy but I‚Äôd still set them to the BiS stat and never swap, can‚Äôt be arsed, cause unless you are doing some sort of progression in the hardest raid and fractal CMs possible, it won‚Äôt matter either which way if you kill the boss 10 seconds faster.
---
This is definitely fake BS
---
Fair point, I can see that getting annoying fairly quickly. I would imagine that it's a case of the system not differentiating between Legendaries and other stat-selection options (where not having confirmation dialogues could be a big problem), as with the old system there wasn't any need to treat them any differently. Hopefully it's something that can be fixed fairly quickly, along with implementing some of the other improvements that have been discussed.
---
not even directly in gemstore =)
---
Go to metabattle.com and pick an open world / solo build for your class.
---
Also this is a must read:
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:Level_80_Survival_Handbook_-_How_to_Solo_Anything
---
That should make combat way easier for you!
---
Also if you have friends/guildies willing to help story achievents are much easier!!!
---
Oh come on. "Outfits shouldn't exist, ANet should just let us swap armor looks for free all the time"? Really? I get it, you don't want to spend money, but the game dies if the cash flow dies and there is no subscription fee to keep it going. 
---
Exactly what kind of microtransactions **would** you be ok with?
---
It's a joke.
---
But mostly around the idea that gender equality etc is a more modern idea (ie wasn't a big thing say 500 years ago, aka Tyria times).
---
Even though the game is developed in modern day. It's ironic and there is no reason whale can't wear a skirt besides the fact that devs decided not to allow or put effort into allowing it (ie it's Stone age decision in the modern day by Anet).
---
Spellbreaker has access to a lot of blocks between Shield, mainhand Axe, and Full Counter itself. Decent CC too for the bars, and good mobility with GS and Bull's Charge if you use those.
---
Guess they're not for you then /shrug.
---
That's really not a problem ya know.
---
completely different keys. they're titled 'mount ability 1' and 'mount ability 2' in the keybinds. i think they're set to C and V by default but i rebound them ages ago. mount ability 1 only dives while you're holding it (unlike engage which dives quite far before you can pull out) and 2 wont cause you to slow down if you reach max height while pulling up like pressing back will.
---
Doesn't change the fact that a bit of dialoge is no replacement for interesting stuff to do. I stick with my point that we're having 2 pointless and boring "events" in a row that offer no meaningful activities.
---
Sure, some rando on the Internets thinks he can get information from a company cause he knows someone that knows someone...
---
I know it seems like necro, guardian, ranger, and ele have some of the best downed states.
---
Never said it was bro, I noted on the skip part mostly.
---
I'm sorry you think that, but it actually is not. Have a good day!
---
I'd really just like to know if they have any plans on updating the rewards of the game (read: items &gt; gold).  Gold is great and everyone loves gold, but I don't feel like the game is sufficiently rewarding players that put in effort to get good and stay good.  I've increasingly felt that rewards disproportionately favor cash shop items rather than an incentive to clear specific types of content (eg; Fractals, Raids, Dungeons, even WvW or sPVP post Ascension, Warbringer, Ad Infin) progression should be an ongoing thing imo and I just feel incredibly desensitized to the amount of effort:value thing take these days.
---
That's neat.
---
If you ever happen to find the achievement for it, I'd love to know.  Maybe I missed it or did and just forgot all about it.  Thanks for letting me know. :)
---
We all love the game, it's the company behind it that we despise so much. Gw2 itself is great! (if we ignore the lack of competent balance)
---
" I emphasize the "trying" part, as I make no guarantee that any response will come back from Anet. "  
---
You must have missed this part on the Post, but no problem! Thanks!
---
A lot of people end up buying more stuff just to farm the keys, so ANet won either way.
---
Seems more like you've never seen a real thick leather section in real life.

---
Honestly the bigger problem, why spend 10m to swap the insanely overpriced runes when it takes 30s to slot in new ones and costs less than 10% of what the legendary runes do for even the most expensive set
---
&gt; They are not an indie developer
---
indie stands for independent, as in independently published. gw2 was published by arenanet (ncsoft stepped down [in 2015](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/NCSoft#History_associated_with_the_Guild_Wars_franchise)), since arenanet made the game, that technically makes guildwars2 an indie game.
---
I used to spend a lot on this game. Like a whole lot. I play primarily cm fotm and raids. Naturally I havent logged in as much recently, but I get my weekly clears. And i dont buy gems any more because im not sure if theyll keep making this content.
---
My wife and I got a budget app because of how much I spent on pof release.
---
Hideous.
---
Aaaaand I admire you again \\o/
---
&gt; Pears are also more expensive than apples.
---
Are you telling me... that my apples are not best-in-slot?
---
Imagine being poor and complaining about whales.
---
Can go completely the opposite way as well. Party leadership system enabled you to join a group to do a dungeon/fractals only to get kicked by the leader at the very end to invite his friend. Nothing you could do against that.
---
It took you 1.5 *years* to get the armor.
---
The interface is hilarious, I'd like to know what the devs thought when they created it. I assume that Arc templates will make those runes/sigils convenient, but with the current price tag? No way.
---
Ppl will be mad regardless, that doesnt mean a studio shouldnt strive for good practices when it comes to monetisation. I find gambling mechanics and paying for a chance to get what you want inherently scummy and would like to see it gone. Some other make dislike that plus a sea of other issues but we can agree that some aspects are a problem and would be better off if they were gone.
---
&gt; ethical monetization recently
---
0% chance of getting a good discussion on reddit with the current hysteria afflicting gaming discussion forums.  Naive idealists aren't going to cede any ground to practical considerations, so it's kind of like shouting into the wind.
---
I don't want to be confrontational with you, but the only rational conclusion is that you didn't answer the question because you haven't cleared Wing 7.  Which basically means that you can't really relate to players that have.  
---
GW2 got one raid in the last **9 months**.  It was cleared within *hours* including the "Challenge Motes."  It's a huge step back in-terms of difficulty compared to both W5 &amp; W6 and a lot of players are frustrated and feel that it was not worth the wait.  
---
No one is doubting your experience with GW2.  They're doubting your experience with *raids* which is different altogether.  Someone asked you a direct question and rather than answer you changed the subject and tried to skirt around it.  Having to wait another 9 months for a challenge is, well... frustrating, and that isn't unreasonable.
---
I didn't care for MMOs, it was just not my thing; but I watched the Angry Joe review of the game and I bought it next time it went on sale. I absolutely fell in love with it. 4 years later, it's the game I've played for the most time in my entire life. I've tried FFXIV, BDO, WoW and they all seem to want to waste my time, but GW2 just let's me do whatever I want and still get rewarded for it.
---
For someone like me, leveling from 40 to 80 was a bit painful but the lvl up books you get for logging in, helped a lot.
---
The game is very much alive. Give it a try.
---
If you play wvw regularly, you probably have 5k+ chilling in the wallet
---
fasionscape is a real thing in that game and people love to create outfits. People like the graphics for the retro art style and enjoy cosmetic items just like any other game. The newest quest actually released a very expensive purely cosmetic prestige item that players are clamoring over
---
rs3 (the other version of RS) has an insane cash shop with cosmetics out the wazoo so someone's buying them
---
That‚Äôs all 3 sets mind you. It would have taken 6 months less as a raider who cleared every single wing every week. Worth it? Hell no.
---
Rather pay someone else to do the work while I work in real life. That way those guys can buy some shit in game that makes them happy too.
---
That‚Äôs fine. I enjoy the change of pace  because doing fractals and dragonfall all the time can get repetitive after a while. And I mentioned the dialogue only because you said the festivals have no importance to the story, not as a replacement for interesting stuff to do.
---
no, i mean your average loot, no matter what content you play, is probably dominated by unid gear and crafting materials or containers including dropping those.
---
All those materials and gear got more expensive now due to the added demand (from the festival) and will probably get even more expensive, once the recipes are craftable. So if you dont need your loot for legendary runes, you can sell it for more gold on the tp than what you would have gotten 2 weeks ago.
---
tldr whales are idiots
---
That, my friend, is the magic of lootboxes. It's not gambling, you're just trying to get pleasantly surprised!
---
They didn't intend to have Deimos handkiting, their intent was for Deimos to eat the hands and get progressively harder as the fight went on.  They initially said that Deimos was going to be a harder Matthias.
---
Try to look at things not as complaints but as concerns.
---
&gt; The sad truth is, it's a much deeper problem than most people realize
---
Really? Please quantify the problem. Do you have a single statistic to back this claim up?
---
I am fine with the rest of your points.  But saying that it's a "win" for ANet to prioritize over armor skins because of transmutation charges is basically congratulating them for figuring out more ways to squeeze money out of the players. Which is their right as a for-profit company, but I don't have to applaud them for it, you know?
---
&gt; unless they are in a position where they have a ton of gold laying around with no real use.
---
Welcome to the Veteran's Club.
---
It's not really a gold-making festival this one. Best you've got is farm materials that have spiked thanks to people gambling on the supply boxes.
---
I genuinely don't know what microtransactions wouldn't get labeled as scummy at this point if simply selling stuff in the gem shop is being labeled as scummy.
---
for disagreeing
---
This is the quality content I‚Äôve come to expect from this subreddit.
---
Rings/amulet/accessories you can but the ruby ones off the trading post. Just search ‚Äúruby orichalcum‚Äù. Those are berserker stats. The armor runes on the Devona gear are strength runes which are fine to keep. For backpack you could buy the lucky boar backpack from the trading post or just whatever you can afford.
---
I feel like I don't get this. The starborn outfit can't combine with armor, right? It's an outfit, so it's immediately inferior. I got this as a drop and I doubt I will ever use it. Not mad I got it, or anything, I just am ambivalent towards it. You have to look like a ridiculous half naked star person.
---
Artistic consistency has pretty much gone downhill with certain outfits and mount skins
---
I've spent much RL money in GW2. I'm no longer tempted by many new things. This said I own 25+ characters ingame on my main account I have 30 or so ascended armors, I have most mounts skins, most glider skins, most older endless tool skins I have as many copper feds as I have characters, mostly cause I had 20 already before shared slots were introduced, most armor packages, the better part of the dyesets, I miss 15-20 dyes. I have 18 shared slots, most bank tabs and so on.  I have a personal Guildhall, most upgrades for the home instance... 
---
The problem is not that I don't want to buy more, but it has to compete with other interests, including other games, other stuff in RL and/or other hobbies. I'm pretty sure the outfits look nice, but I'm still not into buying outfits, as I still prefer normal armor skins, I have bought the expensive skins for several mounts but not all, cause they need to interest me enough to spend 2000 gems, and be more seductive compared to the normal skins... I own a lot of those as well...  
---
I have a serious amount of leggies (not 2 or 3, more like a dozen+ ) and some shiny infusions so....  After 6+ years I notice my interest declining and shifting, some promises were not kept or altered to recreate my GW2 into what it is  now and I have enjoyed it to the fullest, but my interest is fading, I notice myself finding interest only in new PvE episodes, with the recent Raid Wings bringing me no true pleasure or desire to persue those. WvW is something I like but hours available to me are not popular. My account hovers around 240k gold on GW2 efficiency. Some stuff I spend cash on is now available via other ways, with ingame currency other then gems and gold. Some stuff has been changed or removed altogether. Thinking about efforts I want to make... I'd like to finish my legendary warrior. I own landweapons (2 bolts, shooshadoo, howler, rodgort, pharus) , armor (raid heavy), back(Ad Infinitum), trinket Aurora ), I still need 4 trinkets, a breather, 7 runes, 12 or so sigils, 2 underwater weapons.... If or when I'm up for it... I'll try to complete those. But doing events for the 4th 5th or soon even 7th time does make the experience less interesting...
---
A good opportunity to vote with your wallet, dont support these practises that undervalue the effort of legendary armor and red celestial infusion.
---
\&gt;  Obviously i didn't start on it immediatly as in i created a character,  hopped into the game and went straight for titles. I meant as soon as i  hit max, finished all content which was fairly quick, i then went for  titles that all contributed towards GWAMM. 
---
This suggests you started well after release, which is fine, but your whole post tries to seem like you've been playing since the actual beginning.
---
\&gt;  You really didn't have to be active for 8 hours on end. 2 Hours would do  just fine to gain some XP. How was it prestigious? Because it required  dedication. 
---
It's easier to just say you never death leveled in pre than try spreading this nonsense. If you death leveled for 2 hours, I can't imagine that any of the charr would even be level 11. This is how I can tell you didn't actually get LDoA, at least not before the vanguard quests.
---
\&gt;  The change was about 18 hours in difference and from a high risk to  basically no risk. Stop talking as if you've experienced both because  clearly you haven't. 
---
I've had multiple LSs, both before kilroy and after. It took so little to bind a key to log out and even less to run a defensive build with a safe party. 
---
\&gt;  I'm writing this from someone who's gone true the entire process of  obtaining the titles when they were at their maximum length. Why is it  you assume i'm having a PoV casual when you're the one who's dead wrong  about everything we've discussed? 
---
Like I've already mentioned, the absurdity in your post and replies very, \*very\* strongly suggests you haven't done them at their maximum length. I'm sure dying this [many times](https://imgur.com/a/04t9TbX) truly makes one a legendary defender :)
---
Do you have like 20 builds for each character?
---
Id draw the line for every product that has rng elements like dyes and blc. Rest being a secure purchase where you know the price of smth makes it so theres much less emotional exploitation. Whether the anet wants their stuff to be cheap and accessible or expensive thats up to them so long as the product or services they sell arent tied to rng mechanics.
---
Hmm. A bit higher than I'd like, particularly for a full set of Runes, but not too wildly unreasonable all things considered. Also not very much in the way of time-gating, which is nice. I really wish they would increase the drop rate of the Charms, even if it meant increasing the Charm cost per Aspect, as the current low rate is making upgrade crafting a massive waste of time, but I doubt they will make any sort of changes to that part of the game before Build Templates are fully implemented.
---
Well, feel free to try your luck and buy my lucent crystals from the tp
---
I did answer the question above. Check the other responses. I said that sadly I have not had the chance to do W7 yet as we moved and I didn‚Äôt have internet for a while. Will do it soon.
---
If you assume that charging for swapping appearances will be a thing, then outfits are a win *for the consumer* because they allow someone to spend a one-time fee and have access to a high quality cosmetic appearance that they can swap back and forth from, at any time, for no cost. Now, the calculus of which type of cosmetic appearance change (small ongoing cost from transmutation charges vs. large single cost from an outfit, combined with the freedom of armor sets vs the single unified look of outfits) will be different for each person, and it very well might not be worthwhile for you personally, but having the option there instead of merely being stuck with transmutation charges is inherently a good thing. Options are good. 
---
The only way to frame this as anti-consumer is if you want to question the existence of transmutation charges as a concept, in which case I ask again: what kind of microtransaction **would** you be ok with?
---
&gt;love

I'm not going to updare it frequently, but from time to time i might update it

You definitely weren‚Äôt being confrontational. You were very reasonably and didn‚Äôt resort to name calling or even cussing. Glad to have a reasonable conversation on the internet. Lol
---
Talking point on Teatime maybe 3/4th of the way through this past weeks episode.  There are a lot of story bosses that could have, should have been recycled with extra mechanics, but yeah...
---
 A few months ago ESO had a crown sale. Combined with a number of events coming up which offer time exclusive sales, a new expansion that would bring with it a bunch of new stuff, I decided to stock up on crowns..... To the total tune of $650. I didn't mean to spend that much. But I did. Because it was super easy, and every individual transaction felt like it was separate. I wouldn't have bought that much were I actually able to drop $650 in a single transaction, or even in a few, but over 9 separate purchases over a two week period, doesn't feel like a lot. 
---
You'd think I learned my lesson when I saw the massive dip my bank account took, but it wasn't until I actually ran out of crowns, with plenty of great things still to come in the crown store, and lost my job due to the store closing, that I realized just how much I fucked up. I threw away my savings at a game that has no mercy for the financially strapped and is blatantly happy to empty your wallet for a single item. The game fed on my depression and anger and convinced me that the crown store could give me happiness. 
---
Like the person you quote, I went back to FFXIV because of the lack of predatory cash shops. I am not in a mental state to be able to handle loot boxes well or responsibly, or even a normal cash shop responsibly considering how excessively expensive many of them are.
---
Whelp, it might go there at this point thanks to EA. Clearly ANet is trying to ward off scrutiny by introducing more guaranteed aspects like the statuettes to their RNG rewards.
---
First of all, remove **all** mtx. Ingame rewards.
---
Then, seeing how MMORPGs require ongoing development, one could add a nominal ongoing fee. I would call this a "subscription".
---
That could work. :P
---
I've gotten some good information here. If you take the responses in knowing that each person has their own biased opinions, it's helpful to understand how some sets of people can feel about things. That's why I focused my phrasing on asking how this specific person feels about these things.
---
I'm actually finding that the outrage makes it easier to see which things get villified and which don't. In reality, P2W and predatory F2P are a spectrum, and it's very very subjective. Looking at conversations all over over a long range of time, it's consistent that people do not usually agree on what is and isn't unethical in F2P monetization.
---
I don't even bother with FFXIV story anymore. Just skip whatever you can and there's still 100 hours of boring fetchquests before you get to the fun part of the game.
---
I think it was more of a generalized statement, that is, any single-player story-based game.
---
Legendary equipment was already a pain to swap...
---
Right now it's hell.
---
I use only one hero, but i have:
---
Berserkers
---
Marauders
---
Harriers
---
Minstrels
---
Condi (grieving/Sinister/vipers)
---
I have 5x armor sets (with different skins so i can easily tell them apart), and ammy and 2x rings on all those combinations + diviners.
---
Swapping the legendary trinkets was the most time consuming thing, and now it's hell. Berserkers is fine, diviners is last, Harriers is a bit above...
---
Minstrels, grieving and vipers are a PITA to find.
---
There already is a searchbar in pvp... I don't ask for favorite menu since that would require UI rework maybe... But theres already room for a searchbar and that already exists in game.
---
I wanted legendary armor, then i decided id rather have the sets in my inventory and not having to swap stats+rune (like i do with weapons)... Now with this update i don't even want coalescence.
---
Build templates NEED to come ASAP, and a searchbar hotfix while we wait.
---
Edit: also a swap all legendarys to (stat) box!
---
If MMOs all went back to a subscription, I would completely quit MMOs. There has to be another option.
---
It's not about gender equality, it's about giving people the choice to play how they want with the assets already in the game. 
---
When I make a muscular macho man in Saints Row, I can put him in a cocktail dress, high heels and diamond jewlery and go on murdering spree dressed fabulously like the gods intended. 
---
But in GW2 males can't wear the female version of Apprentice armor or vice-versa. A goddamn waste of assets.
---
Splitting raid and LS releases would be a great idea if it actually allowed the raids to be released faster. W7 was even further delayed tho.
---
How many diff runes have you used in the last 6 years on a given toon or all of your toons? 10? 15?
---
The UI is so bad that, increasing inv slot by that amount and buying those runes 7 each is not only cheaper but it is actually faster to switch things around than the legendary UI. 
---
I did stat swap on leg armor after patch and hated every sec of it. Probably will switch back to asc gear swapping.
---
you can get them via black lion statuettes when it gets added to the rotation. not sure if its going to cost 30 or 60 statuettes
---
Mistakes happen.
---
If you feel you're getting some valuable insight, more power to you! I'm just completely disenchanted with vocal outrage mobs ruining multiple communities for me over the recent past.  I guess I shouldn't rain on your parade if you're finding the discussion productive.
---
A thing that might be interesting to consider that your post made me think of is the... sense of entitlement, of ownership these whales have over other players. I've sunk a lot of money into this game, I admit. My Howl is my precious little darling, and he gets all the nice things, I will not apologize ;) 
---
But, when you sink money into a game like that and think of it as an investment (and I'm not saying it is or isn't), it apparently gives them a sense of ownership, like the developers need to keep making things for *them*, and anything that isn't perceived to be *for them* is, as you said, a "middle finger" to them. That mindset is not going to lead to a healthy game community, that's a one-way ticket to a nasty form of elitism, I think.
---
I look at it, and I would urge all of your guild members as well to look at it, like... you're supporting a local family-owned coffee shop. You're buying coffee and doughnuts there to keep them going, rather than buying from a chain like Tim Hortons or Starbucks. What you get out of the transaction is the small, meaningless cup of coffee and the doughnut, not a controlling share in the shop's business.
---
Hope this is of some interest to consider, food for thought and all that &lt;3
---
(Side-note, we're calling them whales, really? XD)
---
Haha, I've been using ESO crates as a prime example of terrible drop rates. I love the shard/gem rng insurance thing, but everything in that system, even the shards, is   waaay too stingy.
---
So much ArenaNet and ArenaNet that. NCSoft nuked the Cantha district and [NCSoft has legally run aground](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSoft#Controversies). People seem to act as if they have no influence over ArenaNet, but have you ever bothered once to check out what gems (NCoins) are used in for other NCSoft titles? It is almost the exact same thing. In fact, I'm beginning to suspect they've stopped selling gem cards so they can begin selling NCoins for Guild Wars 2.
---
It isn't even just an NCSoft problem. Yes, I know that paying for pixels and shaders is a bit outrageous, yet even Warframe does this. F2P either penalizes you in by locking you with your gameplay or by locking you with visuals, and with MMOs they have to keep a persistent revenue stream. People who complain here like to compare Guild Wars 2 to WoW and FF14, but you won't find them suggesting that the pricing model should be changed to a subscription based one.
---
I wouldn't mind a subscription-exclusive server for Guild Wars 2 that did away with the gem store and instead tied rewards to achievements and progressions that would be isolated only to the characters in that server. People could play in the F2P and lock themselves to gem store shenanigans, or they could play in the subscription-exclusive server and get access to achievement based rewards previously locked behind the gem store. It would be the best of both worlds, but people would still complain, because they want it free and they want it all.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs really difficult to talk candidly about things in this sub sometimes, especially when you get auto-downvoted faster than it‚Äôs humanly possible to read a post. 
---
If you want to talk about comments getting downvoted without discussion, just check this comment out in a couple of hours.
---
But yes, it is an insulting *necessity* of the F2P market.
---
YMMV, but I still find GW2 intrinsically rewarding to play, and I even WvW (so something is clearly wrong with me). What I like about a cash shop is that it‚Äôs purely voluntary. It gives me the choice of how/when to spend my money, and I can vote with my wallet. With a sub it‚Äôs all or nothing; I have to take what they give me, and I pay even if I‚Äôm not playing. Subscription models actually incents the company to provide enough content to pay the fee but not play the game (the Health Club model).
---
And i also like that the gem store is not PtW, though I guess it‚Äôs Play to Shine.
---
Touch the sky from Brave
---
Haha, yeah, I get it. I just know what I'm getting into and deliberately wanted to see the most extreme and biased responses from this side of the argument. :)
---
You forget leg armor is also cosmetic though. If runes had achies tied to them and gave some aura effect i am fairly sure people wouldn't complain at all.
---
So you asked a few friends and can now suddenly speak with authority on an incredibly complicated topic?
---
i dont spend my money so other people can be happy, why should problems of other people affect my happiness.
---
Yeah if you neglect something long enough it will die, no matter how badly players try to keep it afloat (:
---
Prices will probably drop down to maybe 500 per piece in the future once things stabalize. Still pretty expensive as expected
---
I fucking love this.
---
The PoF weapons are super easy in comparison. They take hours as opposed to weeks. Most of the stuff you need that takes a long time is really just trying to find a group for like bounties or the caffeinated skritt. There are some items that require you have the Jackal to reach the chests, but you can always offer someone 1 or 2g to get there and use tp to friend to reach it.
---
The same bullshit that they used with last mount. Make players do more, daily.
---
The only thing they're achieving at this point is to piss us off even more.
---
But when you're in a cluster or a zerg, trying to know when the proper time to combo can be a challenge. I use a lot of combos for supportive builds.
---
Even if we could just get the provisioner tokens in WvW.... &gt;&lt;
---
The problem with the sub model, for me, is that I'm committing to 30 days of consecutive play. If I play for 15 days and change games, I'm throwing out 15 days of purchase. If the sub is sustainable with 15 days of grind, then I get to profit for my character, changing games after 15 days means I wased *all* of that 15 days. It is a gamble for me because I change games and my life changes all the time, so I just won't take the risk.

&gt;This is a reasonable, detailed description of why ANets wildly unpopular steps in the wrong direction with the cash shop are misguided. Ya‚Äôll complained that ANet only cares about their bottom line, I‚Äôm making an argument for why these kinds of cash shop items will drive away people who directly impact their bottom line. The downvote button isn‚Äôt a disagree button. Try to respect the time people put into posts, and you‚Äôll have a better frontpage
---
I think people are just sick of people posting about how gw2 is/isn't doing things that will ensure its long term survival. The topic has been done to death, at this point. If you're getting a lot of downvotes, all that means is no one wants to read yet another "hot take" about the long term strategy of a company none of us work for. No need to take it personally.
---
For the record, I haven't voted one way or another on the post
---
Pretty much. I don't give up the hope yet tho. If it's not going to be a dervish, it will be a ritualist.
---
The drop rate is pathetically low even for T6 mats, what the fuck?
---
Basically each box is 1 quartz + 2-3 tokens. No reason to expect to get anything else from it.
---
eh.. who cares about stat swapping lol. Legendaries still don't feel as powerful as they should be. For them to have the same stats as an item that is a lower tier, is pathetic.
---
Oh, yeah I think there were games that priced per hour of play actually although I don't know if any are still around. 
---
It's an interesting idea to be sure... I guess if you had to buy in 30 day blocks but quit on day 15 and never came back you'd still be out 15 days, though. 
---
So what you'd actually like would be something like a microsubscription?
---
Not just the gem:item exchange rate for both ways, but when they put mounts/pets in there as gem exclusives. That's a shitty practice.
---
Cool mood ! Very relaxing
---
F (I still hope to get Dervish back, somehow, even just as an elite spec at this point)
---
Is there an up-to-date guide to maxing out crafting disciplines?
---
Yet people will craft them in droves, making the common person wealthier (by selling mats to the crafters). Win-win.
---
Unfortunately, based on the content release cycle, Anet clearly has gemstore as top priority and actual content much further below that. There is a reason that almost every other mmo releases expansions every year, and content packs in between. New things to waste money on is not content, but maybe Anet thinks so. If only the ~300 people laid off were working on the game that makes Anet money, unlucky.
---
I'd rather they focused on expansions instead personally
---
Can't you swap stats on an ascended item as well at the fountain?
---
$1000 and you can have more prestige than someone who does 100 cm everyday for months to get the blue infusion to drop. I wonder why people are leaving the game?
---
Of course, then there's WoW, which has a subscription AND sells stuff in-game. At least it's not random loot boxes, you know exactly what you get, but I still find it greedy.
---
If you enjoy pve you'll be playing the map regardless
---
Making it more complicated, you want to figure out how to build a store that offers compelling value for players willing to spend $5 as well as players willing to spend $5000.  Sure, plenty of games treat their shops like a casino and try to make as much as they can before players move on, but you absolutely can (and should for AAA games) try and provide long term value and build buy in with those purchases.
---
The trick is how can you do that without getting too deep into the ethically gray areas.  Gambling addictions are real, and optimizing to make your gambling addictive is super unethical - but randomized loot is a really effective way to provide value that matches a customer's willingness to spend.  As offensive as people may find loot boxes, actually selling those prizes directly for $1000 or whatever would get an even stronger backlash.
---
GW2 actually has a pretty good solution for that, though the gold&lt;-&gt;gem exchange; putting your high value items in game at ultra rarity, making the gamble happen with time instead of money, and then allowing players to buy and sell the results of that time spent.  They don't lean on that enough (I suspect they don't trust the economics of the exchange), and instead make too many gem store items that substitute for in game rewards...hence the OP.
---
It is a tricky problem to crack but one worth working on, as the underlying pressures aren't going anywhere.
---
we post screenshots of legendarys here, sir.
---
I think they just mean the customize UI is trash and not as easy to swap stats anymore.
---
There is money to be earned by retaining players, and giving them reason to spend money on your game. When spending money is the content, that's not very healthy for the future of a game.
---
oof
---
Why are returning players not allowed to get the Living Story episodes they missed out on playing for free?
---
I own several outfits, so the question of what I'm OK with is really sort of beside the point here. I have never paid for transmutation charges because I play enough WvW to stay ahead of my needs in that department.  But charging for transmutation charges is in no way pro-consumer no matter how OK with it you are as a customer. From a *strictly* ANet-focused perspective I guess they're a good reason to focus on outfits since people will use them more?  But it's an artificial limit they created in order to drive revenue. It's not a reason for me, as a player, to be happy that they make fewer armor skins than outfits.
---
Oh I agree in general about mtx stores. I'm not sure it's possible to do so in an MMO. 
---
In MMOs most players put up with a bunch of type 2 "[fun](http://goeast.ems.com/three-types-of-fun/)‚Äù (and sometimes type 3) in order to wind up with either interesting stories or loot to brag about to friends / other players. 
---
The problem with "interesting stories" is that they're kind of inherently exclusionary, which has become a "bad word" in modern MMO design. In order to be the guy who opened Ahn'Qiraj for your wow server and have that mean, well, anything. No one else can do it either. 
---
In order to have climbing Everest (or beating Hand of Veesham in EQ) to mean anything, it has to be something that takes either extraordinary effort, extraordinary dedication, or extraordinary talent to do. 
---
When everyone is expected to do something (like beat Zhaitan in an instance) it's no longer noteworthy. 
---
When the only way to get something is through mindless rote repetition of easy content (like farming for gold) or luck (like that time you dropped two precursors in a row out of the mystic forge) it's no longer noteworthy. 
---
So that leaves "cool gear". 
---
So mtx is in this place where if you sell stuff that gets rid of the type 2 fun people are going to be upset because you cheapen the experience, and if you sell stuff that's cool cosmetics people are going to be upset because now they can't earn that cool gear to show off for putting up with all that type 2 fun. 
---
In games about type 1 fun (like say, Fortnite or DotA) you can sell cool cosmetics all day long without blowback, and *could* in principle be ethical about how you sell them. 
---
In an MMO anything you do is going to "break" the experience, because the experience is fundamentally about putting up with hardship to earn bragging rights of some kind, and Mtx directly attacks either side of that.
---
In order to do that you need an insignia/inscription of the stats you want to change for, and all upgrades and skin applied to the item is lost. You're technically exchanging your gear for another. Legendaries have none of these drawbacks, and can be done wherever you are.
---
My god...
---
Oh yeah, in zergs there needs to be organization or it's a mess
---
I definitely think runes should've been more than convenience items.
---
As a general rule of thumb for game design: if a new item is just convenience, then why isn't it just a base feature?
---
Then again, I'm someone who thinks armor attributes should've been "unlocked" and freely selectable, like legendary armor, rather than having duplicates with separate attributes. So I'm bias.
---

Whales are low hanging fruit for a greedy company to exploit. When there are no more low hanging fruit, Anet will have to turn to what's left. Good riddance.
---
No. Anet don't care about improving the game at all and people should stop giving them a free pass or it's not gonna improve
---
Unfortunately, it may get taken down because of how touchy YouTube is with music these days.
---
The class does interest me.  It's not my main and will never be, sure, but I used the kitless PBM build in open world and the kit one for fractal content.  Right now PBM feels horrendous, and the ECSU one is playable as long as you have 75% alacrity uptime at least (accounting for phased bosses) buuuuut PBM IS playable and can hit around 32-33k DPS for the rifle build despite feeling awful.  It is NOT unplayable, and it's also NOT reaper levels of DPS either.  Rather than reverting the change entirely, though, it would admittedly feel a lot better if they made a smaller change like... cooldown from overheating lasts half as long on PBM.
---
I don't believe you will get any answers at all.
---
But there's some things, that I really want to know.
---
But first of all: I'm playing the game for 4 years now. It's an amazing game. Has in my opinion the best combat system of all current MMOs.
---
And I would tell anyone to play the game.
---
But, and that's a huge but, only if they don't want to play this game as a part time job.
---
Like I did. I played like, 2-5hours per day in those 4years.
---
Went from dungeons to fractals, wvw, raids. I did a lot of things in the game. And there's a lot more I could have done (hunting achievments, or playing spvp) but these are things I'm not interested in at all.
---
I build a a raid team/guild, together with a friend and we taught a lot of people the mechanics of the raids.
---
I played in a gvg group, that was pretty successful.
---
I showed completely new players the game and helped them.
---
but the biggest thing: I love challenging content (did turai Ossa achievment of crown pavillion with my necro even though there were a lot of easier classes to do that with, or did the mordremoth story endfight alone for some people, that just couldn't do it and died [back when the fight was bugged])
---
Right now. The game became pretty much... Yeah it exists. But I'm not excited to play it every day anymore.
---
Wvw is just a big annoyance as I'm on a server link, that is dead. (Like every matchup below T3)
---
I'm a necro main, and I should be happy, that necro does so well in wvw groups. But I'm not. If scourge is meant to be support, it shouldn't be one of the best damage dealers in wvw (I'm not saying that I'm ok, with how other classes in wvw are doing right now)
---
And Endgame content isn't coming at a good rate. 
---
The things that are coming is every 3-4months a ls-story. That is played through in 1 hour, and if you want to get something like the skyscale... You are forced to play recycled content, like doing this world boss, or that event (that is then bugged btw).
---
So to my questions:
---
- Will there be proper wvw balance? - referring to class balance and player number balance (what's with alliances?)
---
- will there be new challenging content in the future?
---
These are two questions I want answered. But the main question would be:
---
- can the forum pls be used for feedback. From players and developers side (not just saying: here are future balance changes: discuss. But not changing anything of these changes, even though some things are pointed out pretty broken, other undertuned, and other completely overseen)?
---
Like: necro warhorn5 rework: noone asked for that, and the rework is much worse than it was before (like lifesteal of the skill not working in shroud). But was there any reasoning going on from anets side? No, not a single word, even though a lot of players asked for an explanation. 
---
And they could have just given a reason, or maybe they could have said" yeah, you players are right. We are going to look into that"
---
It feels like there's no communication at all from anets side. Well it always was that way, but I don't think, that's healthy for a game. A game is hugely dependant on players, and if you just ignore those players all the time, it's pretty obvious, that players get mad or quit the game.
---
Did you read the rest of their post, or watch the very long and detailed video that they linked? 
---
I doubt you did or you wouldn't be asking them to "quantify the problem" or "(provide) a single statistic."
---
Days are not bigger than months.
---
8760 hours, 730 hours, 24 hours.
---
Thousands, hundreds, tens.
---
&gt; everything in the cash shop is an upgrade over
---
I find this ironic. It is exactly this mentality which leads to the problem. I find some(especially the more recent additions) of the armor skins they've added to the store to be hideous yet for some people anything that is sold through the store will be considered better.
---
This reminds me of the recent video I watched about wines where simply changing the label on the bottle can make people think it tastes better.
---
There are too many people that are of the mindset that the more you spent to get something the better it is but when it comes to aesthetics that is simple not true. The exception would be if you can get exactly the same thing through two process while one allows more customization than another. For example the default mount skins versus the exact same mount skins in one of the licenses that just has more dye channels.
---
PvP and WvW it's fine but not Meta as far as I know, most PvEers will tell you it's trash in PvE, which it is definitely not the best.
---
Play how you want but know that Longbow DHs aren't topping any charts except for least used Elite Spec weapon.
---
Those are some good arguments. Looking at it from that perspective is helpful.
---
I wouldn't say that this is "not possible" I believe that these things are on a spectrum. You have different kinds of mtx purchases that have varying amounts of effects on the ethics and fun of a game. While you may not be able to do a purely ethical MMO that doesn't interrupt fun, what I believe, to be more precise, is that there is a reasonable and acceptable balance between profit and the ethics/funness of the game. While there will always be people who disagree, I think there is a place on that spectrum that most people would find comfortable.

---
There are *always* exceptions, but that's the general feeling.  I don't feel like it's worth staying good at the game when all the good shit is in the cash shop.  I did say that taste was subjective, but I feel like they make you spent far more time earning things than they're tentatively worth and it irks me.  It irks a lot of people whether you share the opinion or not -shrug-
---
It was originally meant to be for bad posts (poorly worded, obvious shitpost, etc.) or things that otherwise just didn't contribute to conversation.

Yup, I watched the video when it came out, and yes I've read their comment. At no point does anyone ever actually describe a quantifiable problem. The video lays out a _single_ anecdote to back up the claim that loot boxes are some kind of problem that needs to be fixed. 
---
I just want to know: what are the adverse effects of "loot boxes" and at what scale? Are people declaring bankruptcy because of "loot boxes"? If so, how many and how is that divided between traditional PC games and mobile games? Is there data for _any_ of this, because no one seems to be very forthcoming with it if exists.
---
From what I see the problem being described is "some people I don't know and don't care about are spending their money in a way I disagree with." That's not a problem worth addressing in my opinion.
---
**Fun** is highly **Subjective**.
---
It's not negativity, it's a cry for help. A cry for hope. I doubt any of the veterans *wanted* to quit, but it can't be helped without the help of Arenanet.
---
This is why I love the loot system in Terraria. Granted, it's unbalanced beyond belief, but hear me out. All the weapons are so unique, with simple benefits like ice swords shooting small bursts of magic as a projectile when swung, all the way up to the current BIS sword that shoots bouncing rainbow cats that tear through enemies. Plus each item has a modifier, like "sluggish" (obviously negative) or "powerful." The survival style of the game paired with gratitude for every advantage you get makes this amazing, and since different biomes offer different rewards, it makes the actual gameplay meaningful.
---
In total contrast, ANet has bent over backwards to make sure that every player, regardless of how long they've played or what challenges they've overcome, is on a level playing field. Weapons aren't allowed to have special qualities because that's not fair. And like you said, the game generally isn't difficult enough to warrant people needing any special abilities on their weapons.
---
I'm not saying they should follow Terraria's loot system, rather they've designed the whole game to make sure everything is as fair as possible, that *progress* honestly means nothing. Because no matter how far you go, you're never much better off than when you started.
---
So that means people better be head-over-heels for the content itself if you want to keep them around.  And we all already know how they've been handling content releases.
---
naw more like: final burn
---
&gt; This suggests you started well after release, which is fine, but your whole post tries to seem like you've been playing since the actual beginning.
---
I have been playing since the beginning. Since day one. And as soon as i hit the game's endgame, i went to work on titles. How hard is reading to you?
---
&gt; It's easier to just say you never death leveled in pre than try spreading this nonsense. If you death leveled for 2 hours, I can't imagine that any of the charr would even be level 11. This is how I can tell you didn't actually get LDoA, at least not before the vanguard quests.
---
Do i really need to explain to you the ranger method that involved the charm animal skill to death level? See, YOU are the one who's never deathleveled. You just looked up some guide didn't you? Try again, google is your friend, you might actually learn a thing or two about deathleveling rather then going thru the guides.
---
&gt; I've had multiple LSs, both before kilroy and after. It took so little to bind a key to log out and even less to run a defensive build with a safe party.
---
Great, you had a good method. I guess you had some amazing talent of foreseeing the future and preventing one shots. Just stop trying to make it seem like the two options were anywhere near equal.
---
&gt; Like I've already mentioned, the absurdity in your post and replies very, *very* strongly suggests you haven't done them at their maximum length.
---
You're on repeat. And it's not absurd, you are. I just explained a thing or two about LDOA yet here you are, arguing for the sake of arguing.
---
&gt; I'm sure dying this many times truly makes one a legendary defender :)
---
That doesn't mean shit. Ever been stuck on a resurrection shrine with enemies nearby that spawnkill you while you're out for dinner? Yeah you come back and you can add another thousand to the tally. 
---
At this point, you're excused. You have nothing of value to offer to this conversation. Good luck googling!
---
It might be a while, looks like a lot changed in this patch behind the scenes, and delta is trying to fully understand the new functionality before coding anything, so that his code is reliable.
---
Delta, from the Elite Insights discord:
---
&gt; Didn't have time to look at it yesterday and wanna understand how the "desired" changes to items work before adjusting anything
---
&gt; short version on why itll take a while is i wanna avoid using frmsg since that can change on me easily, and avoid searching for vt offsets because then i could be blind calling functions on items
---
&gt; and the lowest level functions that fit* both reqs dont have a likely-not-to-change pattern to them
---
Felt quite happy that i got a Monocle after only opening 105 boxes
---
Immersion was flushed down the mystic toilet a looong time ago lol
---
The game itself is a product worth paying for. Outfits aren't.
---
Eh, wiki was wrong. I had one for a few years now. Never had a sigil slot.
---
It is a breather shaped helm.
---
Good to see the runes don't cost 10 charms each aspect.. that price would have been insane..
---
I'm surprised Anet actually took this plunge when a lot of games are preemptively switching to a new scam method for taking advantage of addiction (battle passes and whatever the hell EA's ignorance is doing) or simply abandoning loot box-like stuff entirely because they know don't need it (warframe) because of the bill to ban them.
---
Raid: We have to do last updraft.
---
Was said somewhere after last episode, don't recall where.
---
Oh okay, if you stream and have all those stuff and deem this not important, its not important. And don't buy outfit, wow. Amazing discussion here. 
---
This isn't a sky high expectation. Aura came out on 2017 and there are numerous threads asking for an update since then. A dev also acknowledged these requests. Anet made numerous auras since then, and the celestial mount skins too. 
---
I am standing by the same point throughout that its unfair they shipped an outfit without acting on aura request, but thus far you are trolling with absolute nonsense like 'aura is not outfit', 'Anet wouldn't act on it as its not their incentive (like no shit)' and now 'lol chill stop arguing'. Just stop already.
---
60.
---
SPACE TITIES
---
Best part about this survey was it made me go through all my receipts.  Surprisingly, my estimate was pretty good.
---
Ideally every old skin should get updated yea
---
&gt;Sure, give money as you would a customer for any other product. But don't feed predatory loot boxes because you think they somehow need your "support".
---
Before Anet showed me they can't update the game in a way I find interesting at all the majority of purchases I made were BLK over direct buys.
---
Yes people do genuinely want to support games they like. If I buy a game for $60 and play for 80 hours and then play GW2 for 300 for free. I want to throw them money as a customer like any other game.
---
Why BLK though? Because they're far more valuable to me than most direct purchases. A set of keys gets you a decent chunk of gold, a fair amount of boosters, before now a few Hair/Makeover kits which I greatly wanted, the chance for rare shinies, in 25 keys you'll always end up with at least 1 BLW, and at minimum 25 statuetts. 
---
All of that adds up to way more value and things I actually want rather than buying things directly because of the absurd cost of buying things directly. Why would I take a SINGLE mount skin over all of that?
---
&gt; They either lost their mind, vastly overestimate how convenient Legendary Runes are, or actually think stuff like this is content created.
---
They don't fucking know what they are doing. ArenaNet balls this up so unebelievably bad and now it's Pandora's Box - you can't put it back in the box and for the rest of the game's existence, legendary upgrades will exist like this and no superior system will be allowed to exist because invalidating 3300g is something that shouldn't be done lightly.
---
Legendary runes and sigils shouldn't exist. Runes and sigils should be treated like universal traits - unlock them somewhere in the game so you can freely switch between them and access a full range of customisation. This should be a build feature every player has, regardless of their wealth, because **the game is better for everyone when all players can affordably access all builds.**
---
Making runes and sigils flexible should **never** have been a wealth or status goal, it should have been a focus of horizontal progression in the form of an unlock system. Acquire and switch between different runes or sigils, use Luscent Motes or crystals as payment to access a different rune or sigil if necessary, but make it something everyone can do without dropping 3300g.
---
The insane cost of this screams that ArenaNet rushed this decision out to "give players something" (something I don't think anyone was asking for) without thinking through how bad their implementation was. The real unfortunate thing is their implementation makes it very difficult to ever change to the system GW2 truly deserves.
---
Raid: *breaks wall directly west, where there's no updraft*
---
&gt;I'm also playing FFXIV coincidentally haha Honestly, I much prefer paying $15 monthly and having [actual rewards](https://www.fadedandblurred.com/ffxiv-mounts/)for my time invested. Rewards that are really cool, and that feel rewarding to get, and that you cant just buy with your frigging card.
---
Likewise. It seems like you can progressively get more "loot" from the cash shop than in content drops in the same time frame is a bit sad. Not to mention they are almost always higher fidelity visually than whats dropping from in game rewards. It's at the point to where I can only see the gameplay rewards being intentionally neglected. The main reason I occasionally come back to GW2 is I really really do enjoy their combat system/mechanics far better than the alternatives.
---
I wouldn't be against them adding something in between a Living World update and full on expansion that can monetized  as well.  Like a couple new areas, 1 new dungeon w/story elements outside of the main overarching story of the game and some kind of repeatable content/events taking it some steps beyond their best LW content. I feel like they would be able to push content more frequently this way and more reliably.
---
**A VIP Subscription with some kind of perks and guaranteed monthly gem allotment w/unique loyalty rewards attached to being subbed would be another good option as far as low hanging fruit goes.**
---
No, I understand that you are saying red infusions dropped from a bug, but I call it BS that it was a significant number of people who received it this way. So its not even worth discussing.
---
Also, why didn't you just add the link on the previous comment?

Actually the codpiece opens up to Hammerspace which means someone who peers in is gonna see a lot of disembodied phalluses.

---
Raid: *John Travolta looking around gif*
---
If you're going to be doing it every week for a long time, might as well spend the half hour and get all the right gear you can to save you time down the road. I found the sweet spot to be level 11 where you can get a full set of blue armor and weapons that you can put minor runes and sigils in.

Do you English not know to how?

4th anniversary mail carrier.

It makes sense, but it's hard to parse. Try reversing the two fragments of the sentence to read: if you only want to sell gems, you don't need to create new rewards that players can earn.

There's actually some pretty cool results that I didn't expect. Was totally worth the time invested.

Luckily you can kind of mitigate that if you have a bunch of laurels.

Nothing? I'm legally an X marker on my license. So not a girl or boy. I only wish there was an option that reflects that in most surveys
---
No, not really.
---
it's like the frog in water. drop it in boiling water and it will try and jump out, heat it up slowly and it won't notice until it's too late. sad fact is that most people just don't want to hear the truth, when they finally accept it gw2 will be in maintenance mode and the shining star of wasted potential will be long dead.
---
\*Responded\* Thank you for adding the "Additional Information" section at the bottom. Was happier that I could submit my opinion.
---
yes, really.
---
Do the impossible, see the invisible
---
IRL stuff I believe
---
Both Anthem and NMS were shown to have been absolute nebulous shitshows during development.  Especially in Anthem's case, where their developers were constantly getting crunched under the table.  Does that mean that all those grunt-workers don't deserve to be paid more for the hard work they put in regardless?  Those people ended up doing way more work than they got rightly paid for.
---
&gt; but it's just lots of little nicks like this that chip away optimism.
---
Pretty much. You see so much potential here and there, with simple and evident and desirable changes, and yet they get ignored and/or abandoned for years. You start feeling that "no one cares" there - so, naturally, why should *you*?
---
I play alot in bursts and whenever I can, I have very little time and am drowning in real life constantly, the upside is money isn‚Äôt an issue at all.
---
Probably would be classified as a whale except I almost never spend money on the official cosmetic stuff in any game, maybe sometime, usually it‚Äôs currency exchange, timesavers and boosting both ingame and through RMT, though RMT was only in WoW so far during Legion.
---
I set my own goals in a game like GW2 so I have something to work towards, legendaries are the perfect thing since everything I do sort of accumulates to an end result. It‚Äôs not really the end result of the leggy itself but rather the treadmill to grind for it, like Diablo, and I do gem conversion to get what I need and slowly work towards the rest. Guess it‚Äôs so I have a reason to play, cause without leggies/collections/completionism there isn‚Äôt any reason to login at all in any MMO.
---
Back when I didn‚Äôt have a life cause I went to school things like leggy armor would have gotten me motivated to get into raiding, until I got it, I used to be a mythic tank until BFA in WoW, it burned me out permanently from raiding though cause I basically had no time to play any other game, just get home from work and wipe for 4 hours straight 2-3 days per week for some pointless item levels.
---
Nowadays if there‚Äôs any type of raiding without matchmaking required in any game, I buy boosts.
---
&gt;As someone who owns the cele red and cele blue, I just feel straight insulted by this outfit and feel like ANet is treating me like a chump.
---
You buried the lede, bro. Also, I don't disagree with you.
---
Treating MMORPGs as if they can have the same business model as mobile games is reckless, irresponsible, and wrong. MMORPGs are a unique, discrete genre, and the companies that develop and operate these games need to develop a business plan that revolves around the genre, rather than trying to shoehorn their games into a business model designed for other types of games.
---
it's a freaking legendary item! like every other legendary it's not necessary! it's a long term goal.
---
 legendaries are in this game since launch. why are people still complaining? it's laughable
---
By assuming I am a troll because I have pointed out that Anet has clearly made the legendary stat swap worse, is very sycophantic behaviour.
---
"You could get the boat or the mystery box!"

"Wow! The mystery box could contain anything, even a boat! I'll get the mystery box."
---
 They are very important, they've ruined the fucking game. Only thing is, that *none of us can do a fucking thing about it*.
---
have those still as well and its disheartening how we ended up with this so called "successor"
---
Awww so many feels! Every time a holiday passes I loudly complain that GW2 doesn‚Äôt get it right. It‚Äôs gotten better, but I loved farming special drops.
---
You're wrong for two reasons, one general and one specific. 
---
In the general case, outfits cannot be made armor sets because armor sets use different riggings for different weights, and outfits use a different rigging than all three armor weights. That's why most medium armors use some kind of long coat while other weights don't; the waist for medium armor is in a different position. You can't just copy paste outfits onto armors.
---
Now, for the specific case: compare the starborn outfit to zodiac armor. Specifically, look at the waistline of zodiac armor and compare to the starborn outfit. Notice how there is a hard line separating the chest piece from the leggings, because they are made as separate pieces in the zodiac armor...but there is no such line for the starborn outfit, it's all one model and one texture stretched over the entire area. There is no way they could divide the starborn outfit into an armor set and make it look like anything other than a hack job. 
---
&gt; And since you are on the micro-transaction bandwagon, that is what transmutation charges are for. They do not need to be available in other game modes.
---
Options. Transmutation charges are fine, but they're limiting for players who like to, as I said, bounce around to a lot of looks but don't want to spend resources continuously to do so (or don't want to take the time to customize their look every time they want to change, they want an easy, ready-made look). Again, no one is wrong in their preferences here. Armor sets give much more customization and you can spend the time making a unique and personalized look with armor sets, OR you can just buy an outfit (or a few outfits) and never put much thought into your looks, but still look pretty awesome. That's perfectly legitimate of a reason to buy outfits, and remember I was originally responding to a post that was basically lamenting outfits as having no reason for existing when they could just be armor skins. 
---
Outfits have purpose, period.
---
They could have made far more with swimsuits. Just saying.
---
I said it seven years ago, I'll say it again. This is a generic MMO set in Tyria. Not Guild Wars 2.
---
Skip the gender identity. He said he specifically threw down a form to gather information about issues with cash shopping. If I threw together something it probably wouldn't be "politically correct" ether. You're only creating a bullshit post just to throw bullshit. Get over it. Pick a random answer and skip the question.
---
Let's put the griffon back into "Skimmer Salom!" wait, what do you mean I've been disqualified?
---
not a generic, just an MMO, but I get where you are coming from.
---
Multi-Core processing is a great baseline. Regardless of any gripes people have with content, competitive vs casual, cosmetics, gameplay, etc. I think we can all agree that the system requirements to run GW2 have become increasingly arcane, and the single-core bottleneck is just ridiculous.
---
i have incredible imagination =)
---
When I found out that the starborn outfit can only be acquired through BL chests it really rubbed me the wrong way. Shit decision, and players who grind for gold or players who spend a little money for occasional in-game fashion items got wrecked...
---
It honestly makes me question whether I should move on and play something else.
---
Edit: it‚Äôs not even that I want this outfit. It‚Äôs the principle.
---
i got you

Shouldn‚Äôt yearly festivals like this be low effort? It‚Äôs a waste of time developing the same festival every year. Sure, maybe they could have done something like the Snowman raid-lite content they made for Wintersday. But in general, I‚Äôm happy with the festivals being in recycle mode to put dev time anywhere else.
---
i was about to turn that stream off,when that morron yelled like 5 mins in row. is he actualy some releveant figure in gw 2 community?
---
I still enjoy unidentifying items to see what runes insignias or mods the have &gt;,&lt; even if lots of them aren't that good a certain amount if randomization can be fun!
---
This never fails to trigger me in gaming surveys. How on earth is it of any importance?
---
Oh. Guess I was the dumb one , woops.
---
No, because the only functionality breast‚Äôs have is to feed a child. Nothing more, nothing less. There‚Äôs no sexual aspect to it
---
&gt; Shouldn‚Äôt yearly festivals like this be low effort?
---
The problem Anet created is they changed how players view yearly festivals. They were the first ones to actually update and expand festivals when they came back each year. Other MMOs just repeat the same festivals with little to no deviation. 
---
Over the years Anet has slowed down heavily but early on they actually made them evolve. So nowadays when we get a repeating festival and it doesn't have new rewards/events we notice it because its not the norm Anet has given us. Once the bar has been raised you can't go below it or players will notice and see how poor you're doing.
---
This fact basically invalidates the OP's entire argument.
---
Celeastial Asuras tend to wear socks!

Looks like [Suwako Moriya](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/touhou/images/e/e7/Suwako_portrait.png/revision/latest?cb=20100830045243)'s hat to me. Now I can't unsee that.

All hail the Hat.......
---
Worst thing ANet ever did was selling those cheap accounts back in the day. I bought a bunch and don't spend real money any more. Except xpacs of course. 
---
But I know thier are some big baron types that bought tons of them and are swimming in oceans of free gold. Not to mention the other benefits of multiple accounts.
---
&gt; That‚Äôs their choice, how is that a slap to the face to me? I just can‚Äôt imagine caring so much about other people‚Äôs choices of paid cosmetic that I would feel like it‚Äôs a ‚Äúslap in the face.‚Äù
---
that is because you didn't dump enough points into your jealousy stat
---
Like the Celestial Compass, it'll likely be available using BL Statuettes sometime in the future. Since I do the weekly key farm but don't regularly buy keys, I should be able to get it sometime in 2020. My Time Preference for money simply tells me to wait for the sure thing.
---
Fashion Wars 2 is Pay-to-Win now! ... Wait.
---
&gt; The problem Anet created is they changed how players view yearly festivals.
---
As of now, they are not *do what you want for fun for a change of pace* but *an everyday limited-time chore*. "Go do these specific things every day at specific times for several weeks, and don't you dare miss a single one, because these rewards are gated and there are no other options for them."
---
\&gt;  I have been playing since the beginning. Since day one. And as soon as i  hit the game's endgame, i went to work on titles. How hard is reading  to you?
---
Titles literally did not exist at all for almost an entire year after release. How hard is reading to *you*?
---
\&gt;  Do i really need to explain to you the ranger method that involved the charm animal skill to death level?
---
The *ranger* method? You didn't need charm animal to aggro a strider that spawned on a res shrine, but rangers certainly could have level 20 pets even at level 1. If you were death leveling striders for exp, you were horribly slow and it would still take \~6-8 hours to get a strider  you could kill for any exp at all.
---
\&gt;  See, YOU are the one who's never deathleveled
---
Rofl, must mean my pre deaths are from something unrelated.
---
\&gt;  You just looked up some guide didn't you?
---
Impeccable deflection. I showed my screenshots of my perma pre and my main. Where are yours? Alternatively, I imagine you'll say you don't want to install the game to give any validity to your idiocy here.
---
\&gt;  Try again, google is your friend, you might actually learn a thing or two about deathleveling rather then going thru the guides.
---
rofl
---
\&gt;  I guess you had some amazing talent of foreseeing the future and preventing one shots.
---
Literally nowhere in the game should you be getting one-shot unless you had 60% DP, no armor, and aggrod multiple groups together.  Even ancient hero builds were protective enough of you.
---
\&gt;  You're on repeat. And it's not absurd, you are. I just explained a thing  or two about LDOA yet here you are, arguing for the sake of arguing.
---
See above points.
---
\&gt;  That doesn't mean shit. Ever been stuck on a resurrection shrine with  enemies nearby that spawnkill you while you're out for dinner? Yeah you  come back and you can add another thousand to the tally.
---
At very best, you can get 4 deaths per minute. Unless your dinners and transit take upwards of 4 hours, you're not getting a thousand deaths in. Not only that but this still wouldn't be enough exp to get a group within range of you getting exp. Also worth noting that the first 4 hours would result in less deaths than the next 4 just from them being lower level at the beginning.
---
\&gt; At this point, you're excused. You have nothing of value to offer to this conversation. Good luck googling!
---
What's it like being so inexcusably clueless?
---
After playing GW1 recently, the difference between GW and GW2 is like KotOR and SWtOR.
---
If it's anything like [Braham's Wolfblood Outfit](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Braham%27s_Wolfblood_Outfit), we'll see it in the Gem Store at some point too.
---
How about the majority of the rest map that can be explored? GW2 does not need to consistently retread over GW1 locations. Tyria is massive and has so much more to offer than nostalgia fuel. At this point I almost wish they'd make a GW1 HD remaster just so people can let GW2 actually expand the world without the constant cry for GW1 places.
---
A outfit is always a outfit and regardless of how many infusions you use on it you will look the exact same as thousends of other people except maybe a different shine but the outfit is exact same regardless. 
---
Infusions used on wardrobe and you can look the way you want to look and not be a copy of all other players that use a outfit. I think this is a big difference and whilst this outfit is a wow factor right now it will die out when every one and their gold fish is using it because you are not special if the hundred next to you have the same outfit.
---
It is like going to a party in a new dress and four other women wear the same one, you  then wish you could swap to something else :)
---
I'd say it also depends a lot on how grammar in your native language works.
---
actually minimum price is 0 since you can also use stuff like reclaimed plates, chak egg, auric ingot, obsidian shard
---
If that isn't the most 80s thing ever
---
I have that Factions box. The rest I got online.
---
It's not a waste develiping content for the game, whether it's a festival or anything else - we are all going to play it.
---
Festivals don't need a tonne of new content, but something new to liven it up or make it feel fresh is always a good idea. It's a huge missed opportunity to have no major references to Aurene's ascension here. The Zephyrites literally worship her and her mother, their ship was destroyed in an attempt to take Aurene, the finale of S4 should be a MAJOR theme of this festival specifically.
---
In general about content rewards, how hard was it to throw three new textures on the kites and add them for people who go all of them last year? These festivals skate by on relatively boring weapon skins while the gems store gets all the cool rewards. The incentive to actually play GW2 is almost gone because anything worth obtaining is purchased with money, and once you purchase it you don't have much worth playing because you can't earn much playing it.
---
It's a cycle of not playing the game that is killing it.
---
My wallet is safe
---
Probably have not figured out the mechanic and play style yet?
---
-
---
There are reasons why gw2 has lots bosses(with tons of cheats) spreading all around open worlds/dungeons/puzzles. So you can practice your play styles, setups, weapons...against different styles monsters. Learn from mistakes. I guess if one can handle them(cheating), one may be able to fight other players(w/o cheating) with skills and wits.
---
For example, Ship of Sorrows solo
---
1st time, I run Ranger. Got the achievement, but die.
---
2nd time, I run Necro Minions Master, wipe them clean. Got both achievement and chest. Swim out alive and well. Make me thinking, was it 2nd time or Necro.
---
The other example is Vexa‚Äôs Lab.
---
Ranger pick up other people's effort. Engineer failed.
---
Run right back with Necro and beat both the robot and Aszus and pick up the chest. Quit and run engineer to pick up the chest and accomplishment.
---
That makes sense. Thanks for responding. I've definitely thought about using more money to get stuff in game in the past since I have very little gaming time anymore (getting old sucks!) and I can definitely see using real money as a substitute for the play time I used to have when I was a kid.
---
My old school sense of wanting to achieve something the "correct", or really the gameplay time investment way is really what holds me back. I can't decide if that's a good reason or not but there it is. I guess I'm saving money lol.

Thank you! I missed it last year and I'd been trying this with my power DH with... minimal success. Some of the other bosses didn't even last through my opening burst, but I was having a lot of trouble staying alive long enough to get to that point with Liadri's insta-death adds.
---
Turn character limit to lowest so you only ever render yourself :)~

Have you ever been subjected to some kind of annoying noise but it's so constant you just sort of tune it out eventually and don't recognise it anymore? That, basically.

If you are only doing it for the lv10 key probably not.

wow that's cool! I didn't know the clone could distract her.

Do they have a nice icon on the map to make it easier?
---
Another great suggestion here, thank you so much!
---
[Unidentified Seashell]?
---
You can make any build work with any class, but my point is that power builds aren't changed as often as non-power builds.  We are talking about general gameplay, not what is best / puts out the best performance for raids or fractals or WvW or sPVP.
---
Anet has changed how condi works a lot more than how power works.  They change things like how many stacks vs. how much damage per stack vs. how long stacks last vs. what condi is applied with what skills.  Necro alone has had multiple skill changes which have shifted what debuff a skill was applying.
---
In other words, power is less likely to change over time than condi or any other stat (power is less volatile).  There is less variance because there is less possibility of anet changing how power works.  Where as a stat like condi, it's ability to be good is based on how anet treats it.  One year it can be amazing, another year it can be lackluster.  This is what make power more ideal as a "go to" stat/build, versus any other stat.

PS: Instead of providing a sound counter-argument, you used ad homenims to try to prove your point.  Grow up.
---
&gt; armor sets use different riggings for different weights, and outfits use a different rigging than all three armor weights.
---
And why cant outfits be mix and match? I get the rigging concept, but since outfits all use the same rigging there are some areas that outfits should be broken down (Shoulders, Boots, Gloves, and Head).
---
Also I am not wrong here. Just cause you say it does not make it so.
---
Mentally ignoring their existense. Not focusing vision on those shiny blobs at all.

Strange that she hasn't left a little statement on the site. Surely you cant be so busy all this time, that you can't make one quick edit to a site thousands used daily for multiple games. Something seems off to me about the whole thing.

I was with you until you said WoW and Blizzard is a dev who cares about their community. Blizzard has been going downhill incredibly hard lately and has been a shining example of a dev saying, ‚ÄúYou think you know what you want, but you don‚Äôt.‚Äù  Also the latest WoW expac was a pretty big failure.
---
I'm doing it mostly for QoL (as I've said before). It hasn't been invalidated but it loses uniqueness, even if 90% of people have it, it still says "you went there and did that". Even LI/KP is making me think twice now, "did that guy really do 100 bosses or was it just 1k mystic coins/$$$". That's just my opinion. It's not gonna make me stop crafting it. I'm not gonna stop playing the game for it. I was just agreeing with the guy. Don't take it badly.
---
Outrage is there, but it feels so futile to even try, we know ArenaNet won't change this bullshit gambling. Completely redesigning their f2p economy is outlandish. So people focus on something that could practically be changed - a single texture on an infusion.   
---
Asking them to take away millions of gold in value of eye cancer cosmetics is pointless too. Sad but true.
---
i remember when ppl though LEGENDARY ARMOR will have RUNES SWAPPABLE ... kinda like stats..... :DDDDD
---
Yeah that‚Äôs the problem. Someone else on this post basically said the same thing. Either take part in the circle jerk negative posts or get downvoted to oblivion. And sadly my post and most of my comments on it are a clear example. I could just farm upvotes and karma if I made dead game memes and babyrage posts all day though.
---
Don't know how long they have been this way but they have been like this long before this patch. I happen to have the scepter because the forge spat it out at me once ... and I have had that scepter since at least May 2018(that is the oldest screenshot I have that shows it).
---
Can't upvote this enough. ANet is an unethical company and doesn't deserve anymore of my money. 
---
Management take heed, this is how you burn through brand value and goodwill.
---
Truth hits hard sometimes, it'll be alright.
---
Sadly I‚Äôm getting to that point.
---
Esport ruined it. Tinfoil hat on, but I still believe we got this "easier to balance" build~~crafting~~ system because they tried to force esport, it failed and now gw2 is stuck with it.
---
Seems like the bane of a lot of games - looking at you Planetside 2.
---
Sad thing is Gw1 probably was esport ready in early expansions before power creep got out of hand and skills did 3+ things.
---
Dude, if you don't like GW2, don't play it. Why is this sub filled with people who complain when there is a very easy answer; stop playing GW2. If you're gonna sit on here and bitch on every post that GW1 is better, there is still a decent chunk of players on GW1, but leave the bashing off it. Constructive criticism is nice, but bashing because it's different than GW1 is just silly. Stop. Playing. If. You. Don't. Like. It.
---
Sometimes it takes a while though. Like for example, [Earthbound backpack has yet to appear](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/axnyv3/etherbound_backpack_glider_uncommon_blc_drop/) and this was released about 4-months ago. They just put the [Exalted Shoulders](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exalted_Shoulders_Skin) on the list and these were released on the 22 of January.
---
You might as well farm keys from map completion, lvl 10 character story (once a week) or straight up farm gold and convert to gems, and hope for the lucky drop, while you collect the statuettes.

Easy for you to say. You didn't grow up with this universe. We loved ArenaNet and we want to love them again.
---
If we were to quit, who's gonna inspire all those sprouts ? Just because we like it *less* than gw1 doesn't mean we hate it so much that we do not enjoy parts of it.
---
‚ÄúYou keep using the word Strawman. I don‚Äôt think it means what you think it means‚Äù  - Inigo Montoya
---
That aside, most of the players I know don‚Äôt care that much about cosmetics. Does that mean I can extrapolate that to the entire gaming community?
---
Just so you get how copy and paste this event is from last year : the initial patch notes were the same ones from 2018, even mentioning the ‚Äúnew‚Äù storm dagger and ‚Äúnew‚Äù hair and accessory colors.
---
You're...not refuting my point at all?  Those games were absolute shit shows *demonstrably because the leadership itself was an absolute shit show*.  Good work was done on ALL of the games I mentioned.  That some of them are great successes while others are dumpster fires is very directly attributable to how the work and efforts were directed by the leaders of the projects.  
---
Those leaders shoulder a lot of responsibility, not limited to the day-to-day operations they perform, for ensuring that their projects coalesce onto something worthy of being sold to the public.  When projects fail they are the first on the chopping block, both in terms of company position, executive prestige/trust, and in the public eye.  Once bitten, both the consumer and the investors/management will be far less likely to allow these people to execute their vision again (without extreme caveats).  Conversely, successful projects reap great rewards in all of the aforementioned arenas.  
---
In that light, calling management a bunch of overpaid louts is shortsighted at the very least.  The job market has determined that their level of compensation is a healthy worthwhile investment in attracting the best that can be found.  Team leaders, on the whole, represent a good return on investment or "evil, greedy corporations" would stop letting slip some of their voraciously coveted cash.

You can certainly argue the current usability/viability of some of these builds, but range weapons are or have been meta on them.
---
Males regognize this and larger breasts are considered an evolutionary advantage, thus sexy.

Also ever since we started walking we had to compensate for the booty not showing as much, breatst do just that.
---
IMHO you‚Äôre partially correct. The way I‚Äôd state it is ‚ÄúSubscription models create development incentives to provide content that is stretched over time, but minimizes the actual play time required to achieve stuff.‚Äù  They want your money, but they make the most money if you pay but don‚Äôt play. A free shiny only available if you show up for monthly bagel night.

Here‚Äôs an excellent example of this model at work, well worth the listen:

---
Except you haven't stated any different opinion or even counter point to my own. If you've got something constructive to add, then feel free to say. Otherwise you just sound like someone that can't take people criticizing Anet.
---
There isn't a lack of communication between the players and Anet, though. There's a lack of communication between Anet and players. If  you think Anet hasn't heard these complaints, carry on. I promise you, I guarantee you they have, though.
---
I have my collectors edition with M.O.X fucking loved M.O.X

Or if you were a new player seeing people talk about it here you would try out gw1 and love the universe even more after.
---
Dang ... so much red tape ...
---
Why, back in MY day we ... blah blah blah blah etc.
---
Health potion for vampires
---
Exactly, criticism, not bashing. I've made that point over and over again.
---
Ask yourself these questions, do you enjoy the game in its current state? Did you enjoy the game in previous states? What specifically do you enjoy? What specifically do you not enjoy? For the things you don't enjoy, what about them do you not like (ie why don;t you like them), and what could you suggest to improve the game?
---
Actually use some brain cells instead of crapping on a game with a single word. If your side of things is to get new GW2 players to play GW1, then offer up some of the better things the game does, most people are gonna dismiss you if you don't offer at least a little insight into the game. Think for once.
---
Thank the Eternal Alchemy for Jim!

To be fair the title says "late"!

The rigging is not the only reason, but it really is true even if you don't want to believe Skyy-High. If you've ever taken a look at ripped texture sheets you can see that armor and outfits do things **completely** **differently** which provides advantages to outfits. Allow me to explain:  
---
[Here's an armor texture](http://i.imgur.com/po2fALF.jpg) (Note: I didn't make this image - the person who did incorrectly guessed that the area at the bottom is for the backpack. It's actually for a naked torso.)  
---
Note how there are specific areas for individual armor pieces, and also the character itself, all crammed into a single texture. Those specific areas never change dimensions or location. The artist has to work within those tiny areas and get the best resolution out of it that they can. A boot can *only* be in the boot area, and even if you don't want to include gloves for some reason, you cannot use the gloves area to add more space for the boot texture.  
---
Also, there's a different set of designated areas on texture sheets for other armor weights so even if the meshes *could* line up, which they absolutely cannot, the textures wouldn't be in the same spot on the sheet, making it unusable.  
---
Meanwhile, over in outfit land, about 50% of the sheet is a free for all. I can't find a visual example at the moment but if you want to see one I can get one when I get home. This open season on texture real estate allows the artist to have the boots take up as much space as they want. And it doesn't end there. Because the gear doesn't have to mix and match with other gear, they can have one continuous texture spanning the length of the body. This allows them to have design elements that cross the areas where there would normally be armor seams. Armor cannot do this. Armor seams have to end nicely on that cut so they don't look like you just took a pair of scissors to it.  
---
And I'm sure there's even more to it that I'm not aware of.
---
Its not that it competes with the infusion because it doesn't, its just straight up better than the infusion. The infusion is like trying to stargaze with a glass covered in mud, meanwhile the outfit is stargazing through an actual quality telescope.

They keep making legendary (raid) armor easier, first the conversion system with li's &lt;-&gt;ld's, now the provisioner tokens too.

It sucks and I'm aware of it, but it's easier for me to not care about the outfit being BLC-exclusive because I don't want it.

Speak for yourself...

still have gw 1 installed, i log it up once or twice a year for a few minutes

FYI OP, late game update notes are when they forget to mention something from the previous patch. This is a new build with bug fixes.

First post was old notes, sorry. They posted these notes a lot later.
---
Is this a complaint thread complaining about other complaints threads not complaining about a specific complaint?
---
no one has alt and not enough token to power up immediatly to 80 . 
---
new players do not care about that

I'll note it next time.

I've spent more hours in this game than I cared to admit.

My sincerest apologies!
