'tis all about the particle effects.

If you actually have a full squad of 10 people and 1 of you is even just roleplaying as a healer, and the rest of you are just auto-attacking with gear that prioritises your main source of damage (power or condition damage - don't care about precision, expertise, etc), then you will kill it in time to get all the bonus rewards, it's that braindead.
---
ah, yes. the old argument that somehow veterans (who have played the game the most) opinions somehow weight less than any other.
---
Well, there was that time they made the gem exchange allow only gem purchases that were multiples of 400. 
---

---
People were really pissed at that. And as usual they played dumb, though at least they did make the much better custom exchange.
---
GW2 is a quintessential theme park mmo though.
---
The lore was an afterthought and you know it.
---
10?. MediocreüòÅ
---
I was expecting another expansion which brings major features as well, along with its questline and maps. Housing, side activities like hunting/fishing and vehicles/ships are recurring themes in modern MMOs, these would be cool additions to GW2 after mounts.
---
Honeymoon is known for being flashy.  NA WvW player mostly.  I think one of the first diamond legends (10,000 rank) too.
---
it certainly has much more resources put into raids and overall more consistent content flow, compared to the copy and paste festivals and mediocre story every 3-4 months for gw2
---
I think it was the strange bug that prevented mesmers from entering the pvp queue or sth along the lines.
---
Pi√±ata!!!
---
Bring Banner of Strength and Banner of Discipline, don't stand in the red stuff, jump over shockwave things. Enjoy!
---
Been working a lot more. But when Im home I typically play other games now, I don't log into guild wars nearly as much and only come around for new content and the occasional wvw. Im biding my time waiting for something new, something that grabs me for this genre and in the meant-time im playing older games or other games with weight to them. Hell I recently even got into the isle which is fun, I just don't trust a-net anymore or believe in them to make something good.  
---
I also know im not the target demographic anymore because they constantly slap their gw1 playerbase with a brick, by destroying the things we loved. So really Im not excited (Plus no expansion? Just living world maintenance mode like content, where they abandon other game modes for strikes? mmmk then.) And after them failing to deliver on the WvW restructuring/alliances (Never will happen) I just got tired of the lies and empty promises. Im still vaguely here but I don't care anymore and honestly if the game died tomorrow Id be sad.... but Id comfortably move on and understand that its the people in charge who did it.
---
you can still multibox in gw2??
---
Sorry, bit I don't get what this is about. What are multi boxes?
---
That wasn't me lol.
---
Yes and it is allowed unless you do any exploit method such a macro to controll all of them at once - which means you should controll them by your human mouseclick and human keypress.
---
Tbh, playing 3 at the same time was really challanging for me. I am not sure if they are really a human.
---
&gt; And you are representing all players?
---
Lmao! Learn to read! It was mentioned by many players here on reddit. 
---
And obviously you never talked about that ingame, I see. 
---
&gt; not a single person I've ever raided with has had these problems your claiming. 
---
Oh, Yes I Absolutely Forgot! If Nobody Talk About A Problem, It Doesn't Exist, Right? WTF!??!!
---
You and your friends never even talked about that topic, right....
---
&gt; I've been using arc and raiding with people who use it for years. 
---
Me too, do you want a price now?...
---
&gt; Your making up bullshit to try to make Anet's templates not look as bad.
---
What the actual Fuck? Wow, that's so stupid xD
---
You must be the hardes whiteknight ever. Hardcore 3rd party fanboy...
---
&gt; edit: look at all the downvotes you got. Sure seems like the bugs were not common if they happened at all.
---
Even more bullshit, it's kinda amazing. Reddit up-/downvotes decide if something is true or false? WTF Dude? Hardest Bullshit I ever read!
---
Springer cuter than skyscale.
---
Ne46b)? ed to let off a little bit of steam - how could multiboxing with 5+ scourges / engineers possibly qualify as "playing actively" as per /u/Dornsinger's [communicated stance](https://de.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9rje2l/just_got_banned_for_2160_hours_for_using_gw2/e8hpatt/?st=k32b421s&amp;sh=e71a6
---
The benefit of doing a timed meta with 5+ accounts at once far outweigh the inconvenience of having to reply to a GM whisper every once in a while. Just think - for you to have the same drop-chance as a dedicated multiboxer (lets assume 5 accounts) for the Confetti Infusion, you would need to be playing somewhat actively for about 15 minutes for each meta across **10 hours** since it the event itself is on a 2h rotation. 
---
Not only that but during these metas - from what I have experienced - multiboxers usually qualify to be referred to as *"living upscales"* since their necromancer minions / engineer turrets contribute virtually nothing towards actually successfully finishing a meta event and yet still receive the exact same reward (chance) as anyone **actually playing**.
---
[removed]
---
Look at a game like FFXIV. They have an auto queue system that matches players together. There is also a time penalty for leaving a matched group. This gives incentive to help random people regardless of skill level, albeit the content is relatively easy. There is also extremely hard content for those who want to do that. Manually forming a group, like in gw2, is also an option.

It‚Äôs just hit but for the first time in any game - this is me üò¢ time to change this
---
People seem to think that Guild Wars 2 is something other than a theme park MMO simply because it gives you fewer directions and lacks a clear endgame goal like most MMOs (i.e. obtain gear to become stronger). It is of course pure theme park though.
---
Yes I think if the lay offs hadn't happened earlier this year GW2 would have ended with War Eternal I've recently come to that view but now I think that Anet is 100% back on GW2 and depending on the length of Icebrood I expect a reveal at PAX in August next year.
---
Was there not an old mesmer trait that did damage to enemies when you took falling damage ( clearly wasnt meant for that ) and some guy in WvW used it, jumped off a cliff into enemy zerg and killed them all instantly, ill try and find the youtube clip for it.
---
It would be nice but we all know it ain't gonna happen. 
---
It would be pretty cool to revisit open world bosses, buff a bit the rewards on some of the high level bosses .Teq and Shatterer are more rewarding than other bosses, even tho they are around the same "level". But most importantly the mechanics could be improved.
---
I'm sorry, but just levelling new characters over and over sounds endlessly dull to me.
---
all yall need to join mvp or vip
---
or tts
---
Actually, a buddy sat down with me and is to blame. We had a good laugh though.
---
It doesn't matter what we think, i doubt they are ever gonna touch old content.
---
Yep, it's back on the table.
---
"He looks rediculous!"
---
"Are you gonna tell him?"
---
"F**K NO!"
---
If the game‚Äôs been dying since HoT then why has been active for the 4 years since HoT
---
Well, I better provide some backstory for this monstrosity...
---
My friend wanted to try out Gw2 ages ago, we went through the character creation process on my acc to save time. This was basically "his" character. Anyway I let him pick the outfit. Big mistake. Naturally, being the intellectuals that we are, this unholy thing was born. I have kept it ever since to remind him why I don't let him pick skins anymore.
---
Multiboxing is one person playing the game on multiple accounts at once. [Anet allows it so long as you're actively playing all accounts and individually controlling each account](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Running_the_game) (aka you can't press 1 to attack and have all accounts start attacking). 
---
The person in the picture is at a lot of Casino Blitz events (I see them at every one I go to and I usually hit it at least once a day), but they don't contribute to the events that progress the meta. They just sit where the boss will spawn then auto attack it. They do this to get loot, but primarily in hopes of the [rare infusion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Festive_Confetti_Infusion) dropping for them.
---
That if you‚Äôre bored with the game, it‚Äôs likely due to a lack of any kind of progression left for you, with all that‚Äôs left being long term goals if you even have any, which directly relates to what I‚Äôve been talking about.
---
Unless the straight vertical is more than 1050 units high (Springer's max jump height). Springers need a specially sized series of ledges for them to climb vertically faster than a Skyscale.
---
Meanwhile the Skyscale can climb 1350 high with just one full flight juice bar, over 2700 by spending two bars of endurance, and over 5000 with Bond of Vigor to do it all again. And this goes way up if there are any ledges on the way up to reset the flight juice.
---
You can use the Skyscale to scale almost every cliff in the game, but applications of the Springer are limited to special types of terrain. I've completely replaced Springer with Skyscale, except for using Springer's engage skill on the Choya Pinata.
---
Honeymoon only runs 4.. the others is a different person.
---
You look fucking awesome!
---
i dont have a Problem with no gear Progression but i find the raids way to easy.

With just w1 and w2 out i had a time i did Raid every day just for fun.

Right now i dont even clear the half of them anymore.

I Tried wow, but i dont like it.

Wanted to test ff, but the monthly costs did stop me From trying.

is there any seriousness to this? x)

I actually had one really good friend I met on the game, we really chatted a lot and he introduced me to the original guild wars. Even after both of us became a father we kept in touch and even added each other on facebook. We didn‚Äôt connect that much anymore but every few months we still caught up talking about life or the babies or the game or whatever. One day I read on facebook that he and his girlfriend had a tragic motorcycle accident. It still makes me very sad from time to time.

Basically every skill not not working if it was on a slope.
---
What Form the cash shop did u buy to enjoy playing?
---
I only bought stash etc but only with ingame gold
---
They already said when asked that they are not making an expansion. The recent investment and job descriptions on the Anet site is that they are focusing on sth new. 
---
Maybe they will change their minds in the future but from what i understand the plan is to continue with living story until further notice.
---
So much for best customer support.
---
Ridiculous? What are you talking about??? You look stunning. Work it, gurl.
---
Back in the day, those 32k benchmarks were using better support buffs. Grace of the Land giving increased damage, more stats from banners, ea, and spotter. Now, classes do more damage with less buffs. The individual damage looks only slightly higher, but if you look at team comps it's ridiculous. We take way less support and have more individual damage, example being an old team comp having 2 chrono, 2 druid, 2 war, 4 dps; now it's something like 1 chrono, 1 druid, 1 war, 1 ren, 1 fb, 4 dps, and it can be way better than than for example if you stack guardians or chronomancers
---
I believe Claw of Jormag should be a baddass, more difficult event. It's currently THE most boring and least stimulating world boss of the three dragons. 
---
It's not like Teq or Shatterer where it's in leveling zones. It's in THE core level 80 zone!
---
Give us something as hard as triple trouble, that takes everyone working hard to defeat it!
---
However, I think Frozen Maw should be left as is. Don't waste dev time.
---
Yes that's one reason but you only get those once a day and they're there many times beyond that first Hero's Choice chest. That's why I just said "for loot" also. It's for amalgamated gemstones, rare unids, and a chance at the infusion, I just didn't feel like i needed to list everything previously.
---
&gt; Especially now that we know there are no other projects in the works?
---
None ever confirmed that all projects were canceled. 
---
And when NSoft west gets a 100mil investment (in which Anet is the only developer) and the fact that Anet has job listings that refer to consoles and the Unreal engine this implies that there is sth more going on than gw2. 
---
&gt;What on earth are you even talking about? Spoilers, you don't continue to employ ~ +200 devs on a game in maintenance mode.
---
Exactly.
---
Very valid points.
---
&gt; Right, and my proof is the declining/stagnating revenue, the lack of updates in pvp, lack of updates in raids, lack of updates in fractals, lack of updates in wvw, dying raid community, dying pvp community dying fractal community, dying wvw community and sporadic updates.
---
Again, though, and I feel like I have to keep repeating this because it doesn't seem to be sinking in, **their revenues have been relatively stable, which is a good thing.** The "lack of updates" in the feautres you listed was because nobody was playing them. Spending money to further develop them would be throwing good money after bad, which would be a *bad sign for the game.*
---
The updates have been for the open world content that *people actually play,* and those have been coming at the same rate they always have, and which the community seems to accept. This content is clearly not for you since you "only play it for 2 hours," but it *is* for *everyone else.* 
---
&gt;Forgot what game you were playing?
---
Guild Wars is not an established IP, even today. Guild Wars 2 sold better in its worst months than GW1 did in most of its best. Most of the people who played Guild Wars 2 on day one never played or knew anything about GW1. The same could not be said for projects like SWTOR, WoW, Elder Scrolls, FFXV, etc. 
---
&gt;Did you not get butthurt and try to throw my own comment back at me because you were too seething to come up with your own?
---
Exactly, I did not do that.
---
&gt;Yes you absolutely can. Games take certain hours to go through all the content and have hours of replayability and/or rewards that gw2 lacks. 
---
Again, that is subjective on your part. You can "complete a PvP map" in fifteen minutes or less. You can complete all of them in about two hours. Does that mean that PvP has only had "two hours of content" since launch? Each raid boss an be completed in about 15-30 minutes, does that mean the entire raid system contains only about six hours of content? *You* choose not to repeat the open world content made available in the LW patches. **Thousands of players who are not you, do choose to repeat this content.** Your choices are not objective, they are subjective. Just because you choose to go to a movie, sit through the trailers, and then walk out, does not mean that you can complain that the movie was "only fifteen minutes long." 
---
&gt;They've cut back on wvw, pvp, fractals, raids, abandoned dungeons and open world story updates come once every 4 months.
---
Yeah, but that was all junk anyway, the open world content schedule is about what it always has been.
---
&gt;How does that change the "no expansion" part? LW is not a replacement for expansions, its shitty filler until the expansions come.
---
That's your opinion. ANet is claiming that they *do* view s5 as a *replacement* for an expansion. Like I said only time will tell whether they are right. The value in "an expansion" is not that you get to pay them $50. The value is in the new maps it adds, the new story, the new game mechanics. If, by the end of this season, they have added content *equivalent* to what we got in HoT and PoF, without charging $50 for it, then I think that's more than a fair trade.
---
&gt;Their idea of expansion worthy content is cooking 500.
---
That certainly wasn't the *entirety* of what they considered "expansion worthy." By your argument, you could say that they considered Bugs in the Branches to be "expansion worthy content" just because it was included as *one small part* of an expansion. 
---
From the article you cited:
---
&gt;MZ: If you look at the history of what we‚Äôve been doing, cooking 500 was another **one of these things.** Obviously, built-in gear templates are **one of those things** that we would want to consider in there. We‚Äôre taking on bigger projects, to be able to release those when they‚Äôre ready, as opposed to holding all back and then doing it as one boxed product. That‚Äôs the difference in the methodology.
---
&gt;**Things that we wouldn‚Äôt rule out ‚Äì but that we‚Äôre not talking about today** ‚Äì would be **like another mount, another elite specialisation, those types of things.** Those are all things that traditionally have waited until a boxed product is ready. But instead, now we‚Äôre saying, ‚Äòlook, here are the things that we‚Äôre doing. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôre releasing right now. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs next.‚Äô Some of that was given in the roadmap from February. We‚Äôre getting pretty close to being done with all the things I said we were going to do, and now going into the territory of the things that I said were on the horizon.
---
Clearly he is not saying "there, we are done, that is already an expansion, be grateful." He is saying "these are *part of* what we would normally consolidate until we had critical mass and then release it all at once as an expansion, but this time, we're instead dripping it out as it becomes available and fits the story we're building." 
---
Again, will this live up to my expectations of what I believe they intend? Maybe not. But I'm giving them to time to make their case. 
---
&gt;A run of the mill open world map with 3 hours of content, no mastery and no legendary?
---
Yes. Like I said, whether *you* enjoyed it or not, thousands of *other* players, who are *not* you, did. 
---
&gt;If they're cutting "worthless content" in order to put out "worthwhile content" should the fact that there's more "worthwhile content" increase customer satisfaction and therefore revenue?
---
Not necessarily. They don't get paid in customer satisfaction, they get paid in what stuff is available that people are willing to buy. They are making more this year than they did the year after HoT, when all that raid content was coming out, so by your argument, clearly everyone hated raids and it was a good idea to drop them. Revenues were higher after PoF, was that because people loved the game *more* after PoF, or because PoF added five mounts that people wanted to buy skins for? It would take a real math wizard to figure that one out. . .
---
Depends on the amount of content and how much the player cares about the world/story they‚Äôre playing in. I have plenty of alts and I still haven‚Äôt gone through all the personal stories in the game so for me, starting new characters and refraining from using tomes, so that I can organically level as I complete the actual content and dungeons, that‚Äôs fun.
---
Most of the people I see complaining about nothing to do, haven‚Äôt even ever set foot in a dungeon, most of them haven‚Äôt even done fractals. Most of them strictly play one game mode and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs so fucking sad. They‚Äôll complain to no end about how there‚Äôs nothing to do **but they only do raids or they only do pvp or they only do wvw** like what the fuck? How are you going to complain about nothing to do, when you **limit yourself** to one game mode? 
---
‚ÄúBut that‚Äôs all I like‚Äù yeah? Well they make specific games for that kind of content, it‚Äôs not Anet‚Äôs fault you suck at those games and only want to play GW2‚Äôs version, which they don‚Äôt update religiously **because they have a whole MMO to update** unlike those other games.
---
The game isn't dead but niche modes of play are dying. That's pretty natural though as all MMOs inevitably change focus during their long lives.
---
Housing should be supported only on new maps.
---
They need to update the springer to make it unique again.
---
That is so cool. IMO area of guild hall should be usually smaller.
---
Really?
---
&gt; You doing the farm event on queensdale 80 times a day does not mean its month long content.
---
It does if enough players choose to do that. Some games can be absolutely completed in only ten minutes. If it turns out that thousands of people *choose* to spend hundreds of hours playing that game anyway, then it is worth well more than "just ten minutes." The time a content adds is the *average* time spent playing it, not the speedclear time.
---
&gt;So, how did you feel when the meaning of "sacrifice for your friends and cause" was completely undermined by aurene using the most obvious red herring in history to come back from a cheap death?
---
I think it served its purpose. I wasn't hugely bothered by Aurene's death, because I assumed she would come back in some way, but we got to see the other characters reflect on her death, and I thought that her resurrection was pretty cool (if a bit faster than I'd expected). I was more impressed that they got me to cry over a *robot.* 
---
&gt;What other stuff have they tested in lw exactly? 
---
All sorts of things. Bloodstone gliding, the movement abilities from SAB and the Zephyrites that were later used in HoT and in mounts, interesting map design features like Draconis Mons, Unbound Magic,  all sorts of small event gimmicks, etc. The new map you so quickly dismissed had a ton of fun event mechanics, like the concert, the effigy, the shooting gallery, the hidden spy base, etc. 
---
&gt;Why would they announce these masteries? The essence/raven masteries are shitty sitiuational map locked gimmicks that will be forgoten 3 days after release, why are you treating them like they're the next gliding? 
---
I'm not saying "they are the next gliding," but they *are* potentially interesting new features that would have been "better than nothing" at that lame stage presentation. I mean, if they were going to throw out *everything* that they had planned on stage, then those aspects definitely would have made the cut, but they don't work like that, they don't discuss things that are "way far out." 
---
**You know this.**
---
I never ever needed cash shop for anything other than storage slots and on rate occasion skins.
---
All those infusions on the main V Honeymoon V account aren‚Äôt going to buy themselves!
---
It's the fastest climber when you know your route. The [Ancient Weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ancient_Weapons) adventure is doable in under a minute only by using a springer to climb up for a griffon dive.

---
I'm waiting for alliances before I return.

---
Sounds like your choice.
---
I think the last expansion was 2 years ago, not a few.
---
That one wasn't the fall damage bug, actually.  They borked the damage of the reflected projectiles (you see the Mesmer use Feedback in the vid) to essentially one-shot the Wurm if they got reflected.  Still hilarious though.
---
I think they should just fix claw of jormags wings shattering in the second phase
---
The guild halls are too big and decorations are too expensive. I miss wildstars housing system...
---
I assume this is mainly to try for a queen bee?
---
I'm thinking this is getting downvoted cuz the codes were probably already used?  Can someone confirm?

I think you mean FABULOUS

I know using an autoclicker to open bags is allowed.. I would think the gobbler would fall under that section as long as you aren't doing it afk..

I have never met a GM in game. Are they active on non-English servers?

Old zones are meant to be "in the past." They should not update these enemies, but they might add "updated *versions"* of them to new maps, like Deathbranded Shatterer.
---
Looks very strong
---
Never before in my life have I seen a GW2 character that looks like he's about to sneeze
---
I still love this game. I haven't put in as much time as other players but was able to get into a great guild with a great community. I had tons of fun. But eventually my Wife lost interest in the game, and this was "our game." And while I really like my guildmates, as they are fantastic people, my drive to play was to spend time with her and help her with difficult content.
---
If she ever got the urge to get back on though, I'd be back in a heartbeat, fantastic game 9/10. Maybe when the new story content drops I can convince her to have another go.
---
Mastery xp has to be earned in the map you are leveling masteries for. So HoT masteries require HoT xp and so forth. Honestly map metas such as Octovine give tons of xp and smaller events on the maps help a lot too. You will be surprised how fast it goes up. My issue in HoT has always been earning enough mastery points, not the xp to use them.
---
PoF is quite a bit easier in my opinion, particularly gaining the points. You will be fine.
---
And for jumping up to hoppable cliff cledges cause the jump is faster than flapping up to it.

Ackchyually, there are seven fractal back skins: Prototype Fractal Capacitor, Beta Fractal Capacitor, Fractal Capacitor, Finite Result, Upper Bound, Unbound, Ad Infinitum.
---
Fortunately we can just take a look at [Effiency's public repository over on GitHub so we can turn to the source to see exactly what looking for in that stat:](https://github.com/gw2efficiency/account-statistics/blob/master/src/static/fractalSkinIds.js)
---
* 19 Fractal weapon skins
---
* 19 Gold Fractal weapon skins
---
* Unbound and Ad Infinitum
---
* Three Fractal Capacitor backpieces

We're at the jumping puzzle fest of unlocking the skyscale.   So ridiculous how much work we need to do to get it.
---
A for the effort but meh for the rest. Sorry.
---
And a memorial for Peter Fries too.
---
Claw of Jormag definitely needs an update to make it much less of a snooze fest but we already know they are focused on new content.
---
Same here
---
Nope they are currently unobtainable. Sad to say.
---
It's so slow it's not funny. After I got a griffon I forgot all about it.
---
Damn this god of war spin off must have been made outsourced.
---
dead game getting squeezed out of the last pennies lul :,(
---
lol no
---
80% of these effects are garbage xD
---
And when they see that face, they‚Äôll just nope right out.
---
Please tell me what set the torn jeans belong to.
---
How do I delete someone else's post?
---
The job of every Ren isn't to bring Jalis/Kalla. You take Shiro over Jalis. You can easily do 10k dps on a Ren. Make the fb heal or switch to condi fb if the team is good. The more dps, the merrier.
---
try to hit it right after reset
---
Unexpected Thanos.
---
My 2 cents: they are just waiting and looking at the amount of template purchases to see whether they need to adress the feedback. If everbody say they hate it and they "uninstall the game" but the sales show that people stay buy the slots as is, they wont change shit.
---
Good post! Tagging and AFKing on Gerent is a dick move tho.
---
Eh, I'll just wait for next balance patch and see what's happening. If there's a hint it might get fixed, fine. Otherwise no more for-money gem purchases ever :P
---
Each of these events runs roughly every hour or two, but not in synch. So lining them up can be tricky. The other tricky bit is getting enough people for them to succeed, which usually only happens once or twice around reset.
---
Gameplay feels great. Same as it did before but with more depth from the nee elite specs.
---
Players are all over the world. Cooperation is needed for the events, as they are a lot harder than before. More powerful enemies as most events have champion level enemies.
---
I think you will be satisfied with the game. Go ahead and give it a shot, it's free to play and after playing awhile you can decide whether to buy the new expansion or not.
---
afaik legendary weapons are in item shop in chinese version
---
You can't hit pi√±ata with 10 accounts properly (especially tag enough to get boss' loot and a chance at infusion, not just event reward) given the random spawn and how fast it melts. I suspect this guy is using input duplicate (1 key = several accounts move).
---
This character looks like they got stuck babysitting a 5 year old girl who insisted on playing dress-up and during that they had to answer the door and just had to give this "don't fuck with me" look to avoid the humiliation.
---
10/10 outfit
---
Frozen Maw looks unfinished. That, I would like to be upgraded to have a proper Giant Ice Construct phase. If Icebrood is the excuse they need to devote resources to it, fine.
---
I'm okay with Claw of Jormag staying as is. I'd rather they finish whatever was suppose to be at the end of Bitterfrost Frontier.
---
And I'm still not playing. So fuck them.
---
I share the same opinion as you except not dead, yet, but slowly dying. I am just curios to see (in 3-4 months from now) how much build loadouts affected sales.
---
*^that ^annoying ^voice ^again....*
---
Yeah they made it pretty clear about the no afking part at least d:
---
Count me impressed. I also like the anger in his eyes
---
Because people have invested hundreds and sometimes thousands of hours into GW2 and would like it to be relevant. Almost anything that devs have done since release of PoF show that ANet has no clue to where to take this game forward.
---
As soon as I got skyscale I didn't even keybind it. It performs terribly. Griffon flies faster and with more practice even higher, Springer jumps higher.
---
The Guild Wars take place before GW1, so we've never played a game in that era.
---
This guy, as well as the big norns I see sometimes in EU, is at pi√±ata on screenshot. This thing has random spawn point and melts quite fast even if you're not on the main map. I've done it a few times with 2 accounts, and lately tried with 3. It's freaking hard to achieve proper tagging with all 3.
---
Granted, I'm not optimized for this at all. I use my normal builds, and my mouse&amp;eyes have to go through 3 monitors (2x24"+1x19"). I think that if you actually want to farm that, you'd go for smaller game client windows on a single monitor so you can quickly repeat actions on each, all built with power dps and maybe minions so just starting AA is enough to ensure tag. It's probably not that hard with 4 accounts. Maaaaybe 6 assuming you make sure you're not in the lfg map (where ppl nuke boss in a second). But 10 is definitely fishy.
---
If I go there and see the 6xnorn guy, there is a high chance I'm myself too busy trying to move 3 accs on 3 monitors. But if someone else wants to check, you're welcome doing so. Basically : if the boss spawns at a different place, they'll all have to jump on their raptor or other mount. If you see all 6 (or 10) raptors spawn *synchronously*, they're cheating. If you see them spawn one after another in quick succession, it may be legit (don't go mad if the spawns happen very quick : it's quite easy to be rly quick at repeating the same action *manually* on several accounts especially with some training : press raptor key, move mouse by a short distance your brain is used to, right click, press raptor key, repeat ... you can probably spawn 4 raptors in less than a second, but other players will still see them appear separately, not as the exact same time). Same check for starting to move toward the boss (this is the hardest part especially if you have to turn camera), stopping to move, and starting to attack.
---
Again, I think that legit 4 is definitely possible, 6 might be. 10 definitely not.
---
This build template is Anet's most nonsensical unintuitive garbage crap that shouldn't have been launched.
---
Can we not have to posts about lack of response during the weekend abd maybe wait for patchday, the time were major changes make it into the game?
---
IMO:
---
Arenanet has (and always had) a communication problem. They don't talk to their community in a way that encourages productive and constructive feedback. And when they communicate now, they can't stand negative feedback (even when constructive), so it's only natural that people get fed up with them, get frustrated and even more vocal about it.
---
Anet never learned to grow a thick skin and an "I don't care"-attitude towards uncalled whining - there will **always** be people unhappy, that's just normal. They just completely shut down and crawl in their shell only to come out with an "I don't care"-attitude towards everything.
---
Now there are some exceptions, they seem to be more communicative with balance and their intention behind changes - a thing the community often praises and encourges, yet they don't apply it to their overally company &lt;&gt; community relations.
---
Hey, what's that thing under that rug over there?
---
You should also make it as a page in some fashion magazine, naming each piece with a price tag.
---
She/her
---
Yes, you would be if you believed it.
---
1.25 hours... heh. 
---
Regardless, exactly what am I supposed to buy with that daily income? Build templates?
---
I just wanted to let you know that I have received your feedback regarding censoring the GM names in my post and I am currently discussing internally on how to address it.
---
lmao
---
Here is the best ways to make gold in sw in point form so it's easy to understand and see :)
---
1. Stay on the RIBA rotation
---
2. Tag as many bulls as possible.
---
3. Get your MF as high as possible. It's very important. 500 or above is good. Below isn't.
---
4. Use VM picking tools. Farm all map nodes. They respawn once an hour.
---
5. Open all purses, containers on a bag opener and salvage then sell (lvl 49-53)
---
6. Don't bother with LEGS if you dont need the mastery. They drop garbage loot (like 1 pc of uncommon UID)
---
7. Don't bother with UID gear on a bag opener. They always identify as 80 gear no matter what lvl opens them.
---
8. SW doesn't make that great of gold, but it's laid back thats why people like it. Happy farming :)
---
That's gonna be close on some overlapping times. And you have to get a spot in a meta map.
---
And I also hate it when people head up to the Matriarch without the chopper, or just AFK at the central pact waypoint. 
---
It really isn't hard to defend one of the central camps, it can be quicker to take the chopper than trying to glide/fly up to the Matriarch platform, and once the chopper is there it means everyone can get up nice and easy irrespective of what masteries or mounts you have. 
---
But I agree that idling at the Gerent is a total dick move.
---
r/tihi
---
Crazy and Hostile [CAH] kinda died too... Ms dad and I used to be very active there but nowadays we don't even get to see one member online anymore :(((
---
They'll fix the bugs (eventually), keep the price and keep the loadouts character-bound.
---
Children, don't look at it. I'm calling the police.
---
That CC
---
Where do i even apply those codes? Says the code needs to be something like xxxxx-xxxx-xxx-xxxxxxx and those 2 are too short?
---
&gt; This was basically "his" character
---
Your friend wasn't that much original - there's this thing that goes for years with making huge ridiculous looking Norns dipped in flashy colors
---
What the gold value of all that?
---
if they had an answer, they would have given it already. It means they don't have either a solution or an answer to the feedback yet. I'm personally glad that they take their time and don't act quickly, it shows maturity, while as I see it, the community looks like a spoiled child. 
---
I wish there would not be the templates even announced, because it was obvious people would become hypocrites, because of some gems charged. You asked for it, now you want to reverse the decision you, the community made.
---
Great guide. It took me almost 2 months to complete and it gave the opportunity to play this game again. You should put in the list to grind for currencies whenever you can, otherwise you'd end up thinking,  after skyscale reflexes, to be almost done and then you'd realize you're just half way xD
---
* All players get one extra ability preset for free! (claim expires in 3 days)
---
* Legendary armor has been exempt from the build templates system aS InTeNdEd.
---
* Get the new Whispers in the Dark outfit and dye kit today for 1300 gems!
---
Game uninstalled when templates came out.
---
Not interested anymore.
---
232 Minis!! That's at least 4 silver!
---
&gt; which usually only happens once or twice around reset.
---
Really? I've never had trouble finding full maps at any time of day (as long as I'm not late), and a full map practically always succeeds.
---
Holy crap.
---
You're dumb. Any MMORPG values your time more than a txn made / day. This is one of the reasons why they are incetivizing grinding and the rest is for you to figure out.
---
Kagebunshin-no-what-the-fuck
---
&gt; Again, though, and I feel like I have to keep repeating this because it doesn't seem to be sinking in, their revenues have been relatively stable, which is a good thing.
---
It, it like the game, has been stagnating which is a bad thing.
---
&gt;The "lack of updates" in the feautres you listed was because nobody was playing them. Spending money to further develop them would be throwing good money after bad, which would be a bad sign for the game.
---
First of all, people were playing them until anet stoped developing them.
---
And second of all, if they stopped developing them, why haven't open world updates sped up? You'd think what with cutting out development for 90% of the game the remaining 10% would get updates more often no?
---
&gt;The updates have been for the open world content that people actually play,
---
For 2 hours, then leaving the game for 4 months. Again, counting pixel's on quagan's asshole isn't content.
---
&gt; You can "complete a PvP map" in fifteen minutes or less. 
---
Actually no you can't, that's complete bullshit and its pretty easy to tell why. AI is simplistic and bland, you fight it once, and every single fight with it from that point on will be identical.
---
Players are unique and not interchangable, every single PvP match will be different with different opponents who fight differently with different builds, skill levels and combat styles.
---
So, you're wrong.
---
&gt;Exactly, I did not do that.
---
[Whops.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dw1nn2/ncsoft_earning_release_129m_usd_sales_for_gw2_in/f7mldr7/)
---
[Turns out you did.](http://prntscr.com/py2ley)
---
I'm convinced I'm talking with a 12 year old.
---
&gt;Yeah, but that was all junk anyway,
---
It wasn't junk, people actually played it because it offered rewards and replay value, because you didn't play it that doesn't mean others didn't. Grow up, the world doesn't revolve around you.
---
&gt; the open world content schedule is about what it always has been.
---
So, if they pulled resources away from all these other features, shouldn't those resources go in open world?
---
They stopped development for more than half the game... and yet the other half is receiving updates at the same sluggish rate it used to. Where did all the additional resources go?
---
&gt;That certainly wasn't the entirety of what they considered "expansion worthy." By your argument, you could say that they considered Bugs in the Branches to be "expansion worthy content" just because it was included as one small part of an expansion.
---
Not really. This interview was given right after the big presentation.
---
&gt;Clearly he is not saying "there, we are done, that is already an expansion, be grateful." He is saying "these are part of what we would normally consolidate until we had critical mass and then release it all at once as an expansion, but this time, we're instead dripping it out as it becomes available and fits the story we're building."
---
&gt;Again, will this live up to my expectations of what I believe they intend? Maybe not. But I'm giving them to time to make their case.
---
They've been preparing this saga for nearly an entire year. If they had shit to announce they would have announced it at the presentation.
---
&gt;Not necessarily. 
---
Yes necessarily. Customer satisfaction translates to purchases. They've alienated more than half the community, butchered half the content out of the game and revenue doesn't seem to be going up.
---
&gt; They are making more this year than they did the year after HoT, when all that raid content was coming out, so by your argument, clearly everyone hated raids and it was a good idea to drop them. 
---
HoT didn't launch with raids and (as usual) was a shitshow on release that put a massive ammount of players away from the game.
---
Maybe check some history before you spout bs.
---
it turns off at 10pm though.....

I would doubt the bug fix even happening. The PvP arena in heart of the Mists will still teleport you into the wall if you go through the entrance portal. It was released... how long ago?

How were classes homogenized?

The communication towards balance has been great so far. Cal even talked a bit on a WvW stream.

The problem is, they're late a couple of years.

But do you feel pretty?

As I said already Banded shoulders scale wierdly on my (male)sylvari.

I stopped when I found out Anet became from a company who genuinely wants to develop GW2 to be one of the best MMORPG to a money grubbing company where content is ‚ÄúNew items in the gem stores‚Äù.

Still waiting for alliance content where finally Guild Wars will be GUILDs WARS.

Pretty horrendous.

I stop at Pinata, it's my 20 minutes of free stuff. Although it's not as smooth anymore as it was when gemstones were worth something. Now, if you're unlucky, no-one is at FwF at the beginning, dragging it out for far too long to be able to switch over to the Matriarch, so you have to drop FwF since it repeats every hour, and then, after the Matriarch, hope for an active Pinata overflow.

---
The high fashion one
---
they give us detailed balance patch notes for how long now?  over 2 years?
---
In this current year it became clear ArenaNet as a company is done. Lay offs, CEO departure, projects cancelled. This company, and as a result the game itself, both have no future after IBS.
---
Piff the Magic Dragon
---
Don't sound surprised... This is EAnet after all
---
Yeah anet and gw2 is done for good. That's why NCSoft has invested millions into the company within the last week, they're putting out a new living world saga episode, and have been making some updates to the game(with backlash). Totally dead.
---
Who cares
---
&gt; From their perspective, it is more inconvinient to help defend the camps below.
---
What a good excuse to leech of others peopels work.
---
The VB meta event is actually one of the few of those thats hard to max out. Encouraging people to leech the loot without contributing anything is dumb in general, but its even worse here.
---
I didnt say dead, I said done. I expect IBS to be last content chapter. And ncsoft invested in ncsoft west, not anet. Game is making money still, but no serious grow will happen. They will milk it to its grave. Learn thw difference between dead and not developing.
---
&gt; the game itself, both have no future after IBS.
---
wasn't this clear already after the saga announcement? MikeZ said in an interview with a gaming magazine that Anet has no idea yet it there will be for a future expansion.
---
I wish they actually did so these annoying circlejerk hate topics would stop for once
---
For me it was clear already after lay offs at the beginning of 2019. Naive optimists are sharing "this is good for gw2" propaganda to this day.
---
If you don't mind experiencing the story out of order doing PoF first to get the mounts will make everything in HoT and the LW seasons a lot faster.
---
i do have enough gold to buy them, but i don't.
---
it's a matter of principle.
---
dead game, I hate it so much\
---
upvotes to the left

With anet being merged into NCsoft West, idk the future of anet as a company as a whole. They may just be allowed to continue business as usual. But so far there is nothing at all indicating the game is going to go downhill and die. The future for anet as a subsidiary of NCSoft is uncertain, but the game and company is not going anywhere for awhile at least. We don't know what corporate has planned for the game/company, but you're just spouting pessimist nonsense. For all we know they could be preparing to throw out expansion ideas in the next year and within a couple years start development. They've said they have no plans atm, but they could get towards the end of this saga next year and decide to start seriously thinking of their next step. The game is fine. Anet is fine atm and GW2 would just be absorbed by NCsoft if they liquidated the company and just absorb the staff. 
---
It's fine. Anything besides that is just bullshit. The game is dying or no future? Crap. The game is amazing and has so much planned? Crap. The game is stable and that's all. Nothing at this moment indicates anything major is happening anytime soon.
---
&gt; What a good excuse to leech of others peoples work.
---
Very big question mark. Matriarch spawns regardless of camp state; her rewards are static, and people do not stay till the end of meta for rewards for meta. So no, people who just join for Matriarch don't "leech", because they don't care at all what is happening outside of that platform.
---
Anet is not merged with ncsoft, only their marketing department was. Still, anet is 100% subsidiary, meaning they are ncsoft's bitches.
---
&gt; That's why NCSoft has invested millions into the company within the last week
---
Didn't they just invest in NCWest? That's not meaning NCWest is going to go all in on GW2.
---
This means when ncsoft says anet is no more, they will be no more. Anet has no comparable portfolio to blizzard or bethesda to be worth keeping on life support if their only live product is gw2.
---
Maybe they eat at a nearby Quiznos 250 miles away, hence the delay.

&gt; small developer

I hear GW2 made aids and cancer worse.

/s
---
Would you play this game if it would bear different name? Dragon Wars? Tyria Threat Tournee? Pact Commander Silly Adventures?
---
I'd say most of people pick it because it does contain Guild Wars that tells this is the sequel.
---
And as for dead *concept*, the usual complain applies - bad management, bad decisions etc.
---
This is what male norns were made for üëç
---
It‚Äôs called fashion, look it up

So because tencent bought some stocks they suddenly have 1.5 billion employees?

This show you all the xp boosters in the game. Use as many of them as you can. And don't forget the fireworks from the lunar year (can be bought on the trading post if you dont have any saved)
---
For Hot all the meta events give xp but Dragon Stand is the one i prefer because you kill so many mobs in a chunk of time. Garent in Tangled Deth have a lot of good preevents as well that poor xp on you so do Auric Basin. 
---
The adventures always give a really good chunk of xp make sure you do them. 
---
In PoF it all goes way faster and i made the basic traits for the mounts in just a few days when it came out. Remember that there are mastery points to be picked up and earned on the season maps and the story chapters so make sure you do them too.
---
https://youtu.be/8BjHpNN4syA 5:52:06 They say gw1 was the inspiration behind the shared hubs and that he and chris were big fans of gw1. He then talks abojt mmos and what he doesnt like about them.
---
I personally didnt hear a direct callout of gw2 but one could take the mmo talk directly after gw1 as talking down on gw2.
---
Still, it feels like gw1 was very beloved by alot of ppl and infuenced them to go and do great things.
---
Yeah no shit but so far there is no sign of that happening. No indication GW2s days are numbered and Anet is just receiving more financial backing from NCSoft for now. So again, the game is doing fine and shows no sign of going anywhere or starting to die.
---
Can confirm; ecto gambled away ~ 200g yesterday.  Seriously though, spending gold or gems on templates *feels* **bad**.   It's not something I want to do.
---
Ok, thank you. I got the point. This is not about playing several characters of the same account simultaneously, but playing several accounts at once. Clear.
---
&gt; detailed balance patch notes 
---
You mean the bare minimum?
---
they still aren't a "small indie developer"
---
&gt;They are a small developer 
---
GGG is pretty big and not because of tencent
---
If you are expecting some kind of response or change, then the fault is on you.  
---
ANet is gutted. I repeat, it's been **gutted**. It's 1 step from full on maintenance mode. 
---
Don't expect anything from here out, and you won't be disappointed.
---
It doesn't get any updates from LS though, but it does with expansions, that's the point.
---
This is just wrong
---
the first 5 raids were released after HoT though. The release schedule of raids and fractals is independent of EXP and LS
---
The release schedule of pvp and wvw content doesn't exist though.
---
&gt;They‚Äôre trying to be an MMO that caters to people who want to play an MMO
---
That's exactly what they're *not doing*, because the majority of their efforts go towards watered-down singleplayer-style content. That's what they're putting their resources on: linear story content. It's fair enough if you want that kind of content, but it does not play to the strengths of the MMO genre, and to use your own argument, there are so many games already available that do singleplayer RPG content better.
---
&gt;To put development resources into **every** game mode they have would spread their team too thin, they‚Äôre not making the kinds of profits required to hire more devs to work tirelessly on every game mode.
---
I'm sorry, but I'm not really obliged to consider ArenaNet's bottom line; the product can and should talk for itself. If you're not willing or able to give game modes the support they need then frankly they shouldn't have been in the game in the first place.
---
If your playtime is limited you shouldn't use it to do chores, you should use it to actually enjoy the game.
---
I came back not to long ago as well. Even from about the same time you left. 
---
With HoT, you have a new class called the Revenant. Then each of the 9 classes get an elite specialization. Each elite spec adds a new weapon for each class to use and its playstyle is changed in some way. You get a whole new story campaign dealing with another Elder Dragon. A glider mechanic which allows you to... well glide lol. 
---
For Path of Fire, each class gets another elite spec. So a new weapon to use and playstyle for each class. A new campaign dealing with a God. And just as the glider with HoT, PoF adds mounts. Each mount is different and actually behaves like a mount. They have different abilities and are very neat.
---
Each expansion adds several new areas to explore and a decently long campaign. The living world seasons also adds new areas and campaigns to play.
---
I'd suggest spending your gems on the living world seasons you missed to get the whole story. I think if you try the game out again and decide you like it, then go ahead and buy the rest of the game.
---
&gt; They are a small developer, **compared to their main competitor**, the behemoth Blizzard.
---
No one said they are indie.
---
&gt; if anybody could tell me about the most important changes that have occurred?
---
there have been so many changes to core systems since your last play that you might as well approach it as a new game. The levelling process was overhauled and the trait system is very different.
---
Is that Deebo?  xD
---
gw2 launcher at this point.  I used launchbuddy for a long time, then switched to this one.  No frills, minimal interface, but I prefer it.
---
Yes exactly .. they should've continued with other relevant other bosses like great destroyer and the claw.
---
People keep thinking it's the "whales" that buy things and make it profitable. It really isn't in most scenarios, it's the average player that is just there to play and have fun. I can't possibly imagine GW2 has enough whales loaded on money to buy enough (limited) items to offset the rest of the populace.  
---
It's kind of hard to see for items like these, but just look at skins for mounts when licenses came out. Everyone was saying whales will buy it up and make it worth it. If you went in-game, like half of LA was the new mount skins.  
---
It's not about the whales, it's about everyone else who, odds are, don't care about the politics, don't care about reddit or the forum, they just want to log in for their few hours, have fun, and spend money on the new toy.
---
well ... only with the tech and less with content. Gliding, mounts, masteries. The current story part of LS on the other hand brings events to the existing world.
---
How is it fake if the players are there?
---
That was 3 years ago though.
---
That just set them to a neutral beige. I'm refering to the colors of 1. make a brand new GW2 account 2. a friend TP's you some Ascalonian armor. 3. what colors those are when you put them on.
---
Poof\*
---
I was expecting them to jave developed the content, then put ilup the poll so that they can be all like: 'we listen to feedback aand made you this content'

You could, but who cares? I don't want to go back to do old world bosses, I want new maps, and good reasons to be on them. 
---
I liked the idea of updating the old maps, up until the Kessex Hills updates that made it all ugly. Not to mention the numerous Lions' arch updates. Updating old maps means you can't play on the old version anymore. Making new maps means that you have new maps.
---
Now, that said, I do think it would be interesting if they could find a way to combine both, to create "historic" maps, and you could join in on those as easily as joining a current one, but this would only be worth doing on a few maps like Orr where you could actually top-to-bottom overhaul the entire thing to be something else entirely on the same bones. If you're just tweaking a few events around it would not be worth it and only split the population unnecessarily.
---
Wow, this is just ... wow. And then they are surprised that people outside that happy-bubble are pissed.
---
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è it‚Äôs the players that have been invested in this game for more than 7 years that have been the most vocal, and of those there are many players that have been invested in the franchise for up to 15 years, since the launch of the original game in 2005. 
---
When the community first asked ArenaNet for Build Templates, all we asked for was for a local save of the build template code as a Quality of Life update - just like GW1 had all along. 
---
Instead, it‚Äôs been released as a PAID UPGRADE after taking over 6 years to fulfil. 
---
That same community has already been anxious for at least the last couple years that the devs do not listen to their contributions to the game, and at the end of the day if the devs aren‚Äôt making this game for those players that have made this game their main interest, then who the f. are they actually making this game for? 
---
If anyone tells me they want to bring new players to the game, you‚Äôd be a fool to think that‚Äôs going to happen. No one in their right mind is going to want to play this DirectX 9 game in 2020. 
---
In fact the better game is still Guild Wars 1 and I wish someone would update that game and push it to a new engine. 
---
FYI: Guild Wars 2 utilises this same engine from the original game.
---
I usually just do dailies
---
You can use TP to friend or buy a map specific teleport from the vendor.
---
hi
---
Do I need to finish the story of that area in order to buy the pieces and if yes, can I do that chapter, without doing the others before?
---
yeah ... show me where all of the new focus went now pls... they alrdy put gw2 in maintenance mode when they started LS4 and we have even less now then before, with not even having fractals anymore...
---
What I read from your response: 
---
&gt; *It's fine - don't worry that someone who spends 15 minutes of their time per day has a x00% chance for an astronomically rare loot drop while you would need to spend 1-2 hours of play time across 10+ hours per day to have the same drop chance! I am certain that you can buy the item later on in the trading post after the extreme scarcity for the item is relieved by outrageous amounts of multiboxing!* /s 
---
Your reply is so comically bizarre that it seems impossible to even begin engaging in any meaningful discussion. You failed to describe how multiboxing in such a fashion satisfies the stated requirements for multiboxing (that being "playing actively") and miserably failed at trying to convey any meaningful sense of fairness (towards other actively playing players) in multiboxing itself. 
---
Multiboxing is affecting me and every other non-multiboxing player, beceause events are being scaled to player count and even if that any one particular meta event does not scale in such manner, it would be over faster if people who press more than 1 on autocast participated in it. **In essence, others and myself are carrying multiboxers through meta events.** Why am I so certain of this? Try imagining a meta event exclusively run by multiboxers.
---
My b. Haven‚Äôt played long enough to have it.
---
All the evidence in most microtransaction based games to date have identified a minority of high spenders as their biggest spending category. There's a difference between the average relatively frequent spender spending like $500 on the game and someone that drops $10,000. And the gap between frequent spenders and non-spenders is huge (considering you can buy gold with gems, this is a big chunk of the population too). 
---
Like for example, when that streamer Envy came to the game, he and people in his guild from BDO bought legendaries the first week. That's like $500 in a week, and I've heard since then he's spent in the many thousands. He only played for a few months too. Those guys quickly add up to outstrip the "casual" crew, and definitely outstrip the veterans with thousands of gold who don't spend a dime anymore on gems.
---
You should be able to go craft it, sure. But there might be easier ways for you to do it, especially if you don't have much time. Some pieces of equipment that came out later already have Diviner's stats, and there's a lot of stat-selectable gear that now includes Diviner's as well. [The wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Diviner%27s#Exotic_equipment) should have an exhaustive list of all relevant pieces.
---
Can confirm, I get quite a few kills in PvP thanks to people who decide they wanna recreate various scenes from Assassin's Creed without harming any hay carts.
---
Here there are the reddit white knights down voting everything to oblivion, which might put anet in a bad light. Just go back to the forums dudes, there you got a perfectly fine echo chamber of positivity and fluff, with your anets bros censoring most of the criticism :)
---
Yes you are correct, this is the reason i posted. I want more people on fwf. Pre event is doable with 2-3 people, more ideal with 5 people. but lately, i find my self alone on pre.  The event still happens though because same group of people arrive 3-4 mins late which is bad for mat dragon. eventhough i have a parked toon on the mat dragon platform i still fail to make it.
---
Thanks for the reminder I guess...
---
Apparently not a feature of the mobile client, unfortunately. Though you can copy the link, go to the browser and then use the timestamp to share the link, inconvenient but possible.

---
You dont need other chapters. In the worst case you'll need to finish that episode, but you should get the access to vendor by just porting to the map.
---
i seriously want them to stay, or being translated into a core tyria mastery [1 point, just to let know newbies about their existence], making them baseline once activated [activated by default in pvp, added as an another unlock with 1 ability point on wvw.]
---
almost every one of these traits are pretty fun, even being particularly nich√®.
---
&gt; more incentive to play the game
---
Because home instance is the most immersive content in whole gw2 and I cant play the game without visiting it at least 5 times a day.
---
200 devs don't put out limited story content every few months. They are definitely still working on other stuff, if their job postings are anything to go by. That's a good thing.
---
It would be more questionable if they had a team the size of a subscription MMO like FF14 but be unable to put out anything but living story content and gem store.

During Lunar New Year send 126g (I think) to your alt and buy envelops every day. It's free profit for no effort. Stack them up, boost your magic find to infinity and open all at once.
---
you are dumber than the law provides
---
Gem price didn't even have a bump worth mentioning, compared to char slot/blkey  sales...
---
Like who are those templates even for, 90 % of the casuals always play with the same build anyways in every game mode (you are lucky if they even have a decent meta build), and the ones who actually use and needed build templates are refusing to buy them with how bad they are...
---
I wanted to recommend the Tip of the Spear collection but damn the [prices dropped](https://www.gw2bltc.com/en/tp/search?list=3544) hard. Can still make a very minor profit I guess.
---
If you're into raids, do the easy CMs. It's effort but if you plan to raid on that account might as well do those.
---
I've never noticed a meta event failing because there were a ton of multiboxers at the same event. There are so few of them. You seem like you just want to complain because they get more loot than you, and you're looking for ways to justify it. meta events are not failing due to multi boxers and multiboxers are not taking loot from you. If this sounds comically bizarre to you, then laugh on brother. Glad i could make your day.
---
I'm for getting rid of them. Those traits always felt like a waste of a slot and super situational. 
---
Fall damage reduction, outside of PvE, needs to be baked into something else. A war mastery track perhaps for WvW, could be placed into the gliding mastery track.
---
For PvP it could just automatically be baked into it by default, on for everyone. Or not, remove them entirely, and have people play smarter.
---
No thanks.
---
i have in the past spent money on gems, slots and the such. but because of how anet has been over the last few years and especially now, i do not see me ever spending a cent of this game past the expansions. and that wont last much longer
---
Ah good to hear they still exist in some capacity. Sometimes I wish I didn‚Äôt fall out with everything and everyone cause it was some of the most enjoyable time I had playing the game. 
---
Assuming it‚Äôs most or some of the same commanders and people, I highly recommend an EMP meta train. It‚Äôs some of the most fun to be had doing those activities.
---
Just like they're working on WvW alliances for years now.
---
And the legendary armor dye fix for 3+ years now.
---
The problem isn't so much that Anet doesn't have a solution yet, it's that them not having anything to show for a pile of other stuff and then tossing this on top isn't a good look.
---
Let's do a "reminder" on the legendary armour "feedback" thread too while we're at it.
---
While a lot of you are complaining about the triple monetization and cost involved, those aren't even the REAL problems with the system.
---
I need some eyebleach
---
Now that's amazing lmao.
---
What savings!
---
Diviner is a Core stat. So if you handle Exotic and just need armor Silverwastes, Verdant Brink, Dragon Stand choice chests will work.
---
For the Asc armor or Exotic/Asc weapons you need Serpent Jewels. Most are from the dwarf tomb minidungeon at Thunderhead Keep. Complete the South and North metas to get the the Bottom Half and Upper Half to form the Light of Deldrimore Plate, which lets you enter the tomb. The Metas are at the 40m of the hour every hour. Both can be bought from the TP and the Upper is way cheaper.
---
I'm really loving FF14. For me, the story of GW2 was always interesting, but I didn't like \*how\* it was told. In FF14, especially from Heavensward (the first expansion) on, I find the storytelling to be quite gripping.
---
I have one so I can fuck around in pvp during seasons
---
What I love about skyscale is it actually does fill a unique niche. Springer is definitely better for scaling cliffs in outdoor environments, and a practiced griffon covers much more ground or air space much faster for sure. But there are spaces where skyscales outshine everything for me, especially in closed areas like caves where low ceilings and irregular formations intrude often. I am a fan of map exploration, even 7 years in, and skyscale totally opens things up without the hassle of having to practice weird angle movements. 10/10 would do the miserable grind again.
---
Make sure to unequip half your armor if you want strikes to be remotely challenging.
---
Past 2 weeks all I did was fractal dailies like 3 days and loged straight off. It's like I care for the time I put in the game, I like the foundation of the game but I do not care about the overall product at all anymore. Idc about the lore and the story anymore. Idc about what there is to do atm and idc about the future. We should've gotten an expantion this autumn.
---
Didn't know fat Nick played GW2

are u too excited? cos the blood left your brain and went down

They make the game for the üíé buyers...
---
There have been many friends and guild mates from other games who have asked me how the game is, and my response is always:
---
I love the game and play it every now and then, but the devs don‚Äôt care for the game, NCSoft and ArenaNet don‚Äôt care for the game, all they want is for people to buy gems and tell them to bugger off. Communication is nonexistent and the devs blatantly ignore the feedback from their most dedicated players. I log in because I love the combat system and have spent way too many hours in it to just leave it. But I‚Äôm on the edge. I‚Äôm not sure how much longer I can accept the this POS company.
---
Calling it an achievement doesn't make your hoarding problem any less of a problem. 
---
You start with this, and next thing you know you have a room full of old typewriters.
---
&gt; I never used arcdps
---
Then you have no place in this conversation.  Invalidated your long post in the first sentence.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bladed_armor
---
Stat selectable: all but the chest piece can be bought for airship parts in VB
---
You don't make a great case for it by showing a reason why they should not stay in PvP.
---
Please don't pull them off.
---
By that logic Arenanet has all the financial backing of NCsoft‚Äôs total earnings. No that money definitely doesn‚Äôt go to anything other than GW2, nope.
---
Learning by failing is the way that works best for humans.
---
its faking player numbers,bcs you can join any map and you gona be HEEEEY,thats amazing every map is full of ppl this game have MILIONS AND MILIONS of players and then you realize that  50% are smurf accs doing map completation 40% are ppl doing some collections and they are all just puked on one map. Sometimes megaserver  put you on EMPTY map and you will never gona see anyone ever again XD
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. Started during head start and played 8-12 hours every day for the first months and have played between 2-7 hours every day since on average.
---
I‚Äôve spent on average almost $60 every month on the game since it launched.
---
I‚Äôm so sick of the devs continuing to ignore their most faithful players and, honestly, just giving us the finger time and time again. If things don‚Äôt change in the next patch I‚Äôm done. Over 10.000 hours and $5000 in gems down the drain.
---
Ah yes, Mrs. Fernsbey
---
To be fair, a relatively small part of the playerbase will actually go back and play GW1 if anet did anything to it, and it‚Äôs all of you guys who waste your time here. A lot of GW2 players, like myself, prefer the content that GW2 offers and prefer it more so than the first. GW2 is what makes them money, so they need to prioritize that or a new game. Less money means less content. GW1 has run its course now, there‚Äôs   no reason for them to go back to the game besides you guys on here.
---
All i do are raids 2 times a week. I don't want to let my friends down. Idc anymore about raids, fractals or wvw. ArenaNet gave me about 10k hours of fun, gw2 was my passion. I made my own investment tools for the trading post. It's really sad to see the game in this state, i don't even bother to install gw on my new pc. I just hook up the old pc.
---
Yet another fantastic example of why this game should have 'hide other players mount / item skins'
---
Looking like you actually exist in the world, while some idiot looks like an anime character sure is annoying.
---
Well, that stings a little.
---
I don't think I can ever sleep again now...
---
I'd honestly suggest watching some high level content if you're considering FFXIV. The 50 and below portion does a *really* bad job of showing why people love the game.
---
GW2 definitely wasn't awesome at launch outside maybe PVP, we were just way more forgiving.
---
Yup
---
Just chiming in here, as of Sept 2018, they only had 14 developers actually working on the PoE.
---
Oh nice, that's sweet!
---
do you think they really care about feedback?
---
I think if GW2 was a bit more.......graceful about it, they could have done it honestly. FFXIV appeals to both casual players and hardcore players and does just fine. Granted, the bar for casual in FFXIV *is* higher than in GW2.
---
14? For the live game? That would put anet to shame even further than they already do. Also sauce?
---
they still added more events to the zones after PoF
---
No I went out of my way to make this post to make you cry.
---
Dude, **you** are the only one here using the word "common"... 
---
It's okay, just roast yourself. xD
---
However, I will repeat my other comment, since because you ignored it, it shows that you know you talk talking bullshit. ;)
---
Just google "arc templates bug" and you will find several reddit threads about several different bugs including those that last until the very end of the tool. 
---
Bugs like this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/br8evp/having_a_small_build_template_problem_arcdps/
---
&gt; The issue arises when I have twilight in my inventory. Just having it in my bag seems to mess up all my builds, it always equips the twilight for a second, even though it was never saved in any of my templates, then removes it and messes with the loading of my other weapons, leaving me with no main hand weapon at all.
---
Or this:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a0r31d/psa_arcdps_build_templates_is_apparently_eating/
---
&gt; Yes, I know, we take a risk by using a third party addon on, so on and so forth.
---
&gt; However, I figured it was worth posting this so one else loses any runes until it gets fixed.
---
&gt; In my case, I was swapping my legendary gear around and it ate my runes of sanctuary.
---
Or this...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7udpqd/arcdps_templates_problem/
---
&gt; The build templates are weird all of a sudden. It doesnt load everything. Like half mirage gear and half chrono build etc. Tried to make new templates, and reinstalled the dll.. Any idea how i can get it to work as intended again?

&gt; I've got the latest version of the main and build template .dlls and have resaved by overwriting all my builds but it won't swap out the runes/sigils or the infusions. Is this happening to everyone?

---
Yeah, "No bugs". Sure Mr. Whiteknight. ;)
---
This conversation is for gw2 players, not for the small part of the community that has been demanding build templates. That attitude is why you're so unhappy. You expected this feature to cater to you.
---
My point in making it is that for many players, build templates have had absolutely no negative impact. Anet hasn't destroyed their game, they've just failed to give you what you want.
---
Not the same team at all.
---
1) Not many mmos disclose the number of players online in real time or any statistics of thid kind.
---
2) There is no need for open world lfg outside of metas and killing champions for collections.
---
3) If you ever need dungeon runs, if you start your own group it wont take more than 5-10 mins to fill.
---
4) Atm there are 18 lfg groups in raids (with only 2 selling ads, keep in mind that raid reset is on monday not today).
---
5) Doing fractals daily and I never had a problem finding a healer when it was needed (the role you wait the most time for)
---
Conclusions: People are scared to start an lfg ad.
---
The gear was the same, but the build changed. Only had to swap weapons.
---
Well it's not Anets fault that they are stupid enough to gamble.
---
I want to say those are from the Bounty Hunter set, as those are the only "ripped jeans" pants that I know of. Could be wrong, though.
---
When I first started playing I did my best to have the most horrendous Hot Pink/Purple armor. Now I do up all my armor in Order of Whispers colors - I feel bad for anyone that had to witness the former.
---
Yeah, Gail was always like that sadly.
---
The feedback thread you linked were created at October 28th. Today is November 17th. That's less than 3 weeks, *not* "almost 2 months".
---
Hmm, I'm not sure. I didn't notice there were default dye colors. Probably there's no easier way than using the wiki.
---
I dont see how that benefits any of the 4 mentioned modes.
---
Building off of this, doing something like binging back LS1 would be more comparable to WoW classic, something the devs have mentioned attempts at bringing back
---
Lmfao. One of the he best fashion wars themes I've seen. You had me dying OP.
---
Toss out the Arc comment, literally the exact next thing you stated:
---
&gt;Instead, I've completely ignored build templates and gone about my day as before.
---
A.k.a. The good ol
---
&gt;I don't have/care about the problem, so there is no problem.
---
What's so ironic is, you also think a tiny part of the community is whining, yet the second the build hit the game, the entire sub-reddit for a week straight was nothing but build template posts, there are 14 straight pages of feedback on the official thread, pre-build people joined the livestream and gave feedback for the entire month.
---
It's an absolute joke that you think this is such a small issue affecting only the smallest amount of people.
---
&gt; leeching events and outright AFKing on them without contributing anything meaningfull to get them done.
---
You are just describing the average open world player here.
---
This post won't change things much.
---
Clearly you care about this a lot so I'm not gonna be able to change your mind. I just wanted to offer some perspective. A few hundred people seem to be very upset. Maybe even a few thousand. But that'd a drop in the bucket really. The people who use arcdps and demanded build templates are much more likely to be vocal on message boards for the game.
---
You're misinformed, Arenanet asked for feedback an entire month before the post, they livestreamed the build templates and asked for feedback, which was also ignored.
---
I'm sick of all the bots and troll match riggers. Playing PvP is a roll of the dice. Anet when will you care? When will you give some hope to PvP? Just perma ban the bot accounts please. Do something, do anything. How you guys are missing out on one of the most lucrative parts of your game is beyond me. Competition brings hype and more players.
---
Some individual devs are fantastic for being open and communicative, and I feel like they would love to be engaging with the community more, but whatever this bizarre company policy/culture is, is stopping them.
---
Yes, because achievements where you have to spend most of your time buying ingredients from the TP and be stationary at the crafting station are so fun and immersive...
---
It was trash gameplay when they reduced gen2 legendaries crafting to that, and it was trash gameplay for the cooking achievement too.
---
Please, don't ask for more of that.
---
I was talking about GW2 in PoE global chat yesterday, most dudes were surprised to know GW2 was still a thing...

Last time we checked Anet had 180 (post layoffs), 80% of them asigned to artists.

---
&gt; GW1 is still there. If so many people so desperately want to play it, it's there. Yet the population is extremely small.
---
Because nobody's taking care of it.
---
WoW private servers for old content managed to remain relevant for so long for many reasons, but the biggest one is probably development. There are a bunch of different servers with their own rules. Some try to recreate the old experience, some roll out fanmade content, some tweak the balance, add new items to the loot table, introduce 4.0 features several expansions early, fix bugs, they run events and tournaments, etc.
---
We don't have that for GW1, there are no private servers. Anet is in charge of the whole thing, including banning bots and cheaters, but they really don't care anymore. People are reluctant to invest into something that has been abandoned by the developers. Private servers get by because the players are the developers.
---
Things have also lost a lot of value over the years. Old private servers shut down on a regular basis and new ones spring up to take their place. People love a fresh start and it is necessary to keep rewards relevant. Once everyone has achieved everything, things become meaningless. I'd be really curious what would happen if GW1 was re-released, either officially or as a private server.
---
Even then, private server numbers were nowhere near Classic WoW's numbers. Nothing will ever attract as many players as the actual studio making an effort.
---
We can't know how popular GW1 would be unless Anet actually made an effort.
---
Not a skin, but [Uncanny Canner](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Uncanny_Canner) is a quick way to get a nearly-free 20 slot bag.
---
i came from the diablo series with so much loot i could never hold it all, to this game (gw1-gw2) where loot is scarce and i hated it at first, but i came to understand that loot is scarce because the market for any loot would bottom out if everyone got so much. loot scarcity and soul/account bound gear and skins are meant to stabilize the economy.
---
ofc the system isnt perfect, the best fashion drops are way too rare. just make infusions account bound and raise their rarity!
---
...in very specific situations, it's maybe 40% faster at most.
---
From the town of Agua Fria...
---
I watched whole Exilecon livestream and it was glorious. My favourite part was the Einhar intro, he did so good! All the PoE devs are clearly passionate gamers and aren't corrupted as ArenaNet when it comes to money or admitting mistakes - they are releasing mobile PoE and explicitly said it's not a moneymilking mobile game, but their PC game on mobile, and if it's successful on PC then it's all that matters.
---
Also big respect when Chris interrupted the speedrun competition to say some computers had cached minimaps and they need to restart.
---
To be specific, what they ultimately did was to market it as "Templates are finally here!"  But ultimately only change the existing build system, with the "template" (loadouts) functions costing extra.  
---
The real sin IMO is that this system punishes those who requested it, who wanted and needed it.  The more you would use it, the more you are punished for buying into it.  
---
I don't even need the system but I'm looking at this and thinking, "Now how long until they do this to something I do care about?"
---
Inventory management is a nightmare ? Clean up maybe ? With the gear template (which is worse) you don't even have to deal with your gear. So i don't know how you manage it but it's fairly easy.
---
We have famous players, but you have to be involved in a game mode to know the famous players of this one.  
---
If you can't deal with the wiki, just find a guild to do it for you. It's an mmo after all. 
---
I agree with the other things you hate. :)
---
I use to play a pink Norn Guardian on BG (mostly WvW) because he stuck out like a sore thumb during zerg encounters.
---
Now I want to play him again and apply some costumes/fashion to make him stand out even more.
---
Those devs were all laid off or left on their own by now AFAIK.  They way templates worked since their release it really feels like somebody threw together just enough that it would not get abandoned, but some poor soul was now faced with a bunch of code, likely badly written, zero documentation of any kind of course, and being told to get it working.  It could also just be a result of how they've always done business;  It always stuck out to me when people would talk about the devs constantly swapping teams and working on all different parts of the game.  It didn't do anything good for anyone when bosses did this stuff at retail store where the work was pretty mindless, how could it come to a better result in a business whose work involves building complex systems and interactions?

While my expectations for the current crew in there are extremely low, bear in mind that the most of employees and the CEO who made this company such a mess have all left now and are making their own new thing over at Manaworks.  If anything, the biggest reason I haven't yet uninstalled the game is because of a great sense of curiosity about whether MZ will turn things around or keep the trajectory MO's leadership (or lack of?) had the game on.
---
Kratos
---
That's the hottest take anyone has ever had about GW2 lmao.
---
This is peak content
---
There may have been people that left GW2 but they can't seem to get it out of their minds. Take this guy for example. He left a while back yet still comes to this sub for a good old GW2 bash. Doesn't play yet most of his posts are GW2. GW2 is still going strong.
---
GW2 still has a growing player base even though there are players leaving. This guy just comes to this sub to give his daily doom shit posts. Ask yourselves how many doom posts do you see? How often is some saying the game is about to die? From the very start there were these doom posters.
---
 It's no surprise that everything has its end but Guild Wars 2 is nowhere near that right now. People like this guy just post the same stuff all the time. So yeah one day you'll be right and I'm sure you'll tell everyone "I told you so" after years and years making the same stupid predictions.
---
Well in fractals I can already see less people, it happened that I could not pug some hard ones with hard singularity has no one bothered to quequee
---
that sounds oddly specific and personal
---
Any advice on what I should do to prepare for the new content?
---
At one point in time Anet devs did talk to the community, but some guy ruined it (I forget the incident) and there was a gag order placed.  That was the downfall of Anet's communication - it was so nice to talk with devs (not just game devs but art, programming, etc) and get their thoughts/feedback on things.
---
I find that a lot of big studios / games have this anti-feedback ideology.  I find a lot of feedback is ignored and/or only for show ("we care about your opinion").  ie. Did anything actually change from all those anet hosted feedback threads a few years ago?
---
If you have a character at cap, I'd suggest doing the introductory quest for Path of Fire first as that will unlock the raptor mount for all of your characters.
---
Most of the birthday gifts include a dye pack.  The dyes you'll get from them are bound, but are account-wide unlocks and acquiring many of these dye colors would be prohibitively expensive, so I'd check the wiki and the dye panel of the character sheet to make your selections.  As an example, do you like that Celestial Blue Dye?  Well you can use one of your 7th Birthday Gift dye packs for that or spend 480 gold...
---
Nope. No preview.
---
Hi guys!! Just wanna ask a simple question. When i am in Lion's Arch,  use to see so many people with Celebration Boost with remaining time like 4 days, 3 days, 18 hrs, etc everyday. Now i know about Primer item which increases the duration of Consumables. So, is there any way to farm Celebration boosters or everyone keep stacking the duration with Primers. Asking cause i barely get like 2 boosters every month. Would really appreciate if you guys could shed some light.
---
GW2's presentation was godawful, but there's a part of me that feels like they were forced into it with little thought given to what they actually had available to show.  I heard they were doing it to try and steal some of Blizzard's announcement thunder.  
---
The only reason I'm willing to give that theory consideration is that the content that directly followed, Grothmar, was some of the best they've done in a long while.  
---
As for responding to feedback, they've historically had severe issues on their forums with trying to enforce some kind of "safe space" type of thing, and appearing to not monitor any of their moderators at all.  
---
It's a company level issue because people who simply were not equipped to handle the job were taking it on and became bent on trying to force it into the shape they wanted.  It goes beyond community managers and moderation teams as this also speaks to the higher ups in management and their policies and methods too.  
---
I'm curious as to whether the changes in the company makeup and leadership will make a difference.  The communication we've been seeing from the balance teams are an excellent sign pointing towards that.  Maybe enough of the "old guard" who didn't/wouldn't engage with the community have been swept out to allow more positive improvement.
---
Here is [a handy chart](https://i.imgur.com/s71sJc3.png) showing almost everything that's been added to the game over the years.

Here is [a great story guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/) with supplemental material.  
---
[Action Camera](https://youtu.be/-Y2czD6BREw) was added with HoT.  Many players prefer it over classic handling.
---
For birthday gifts, the biggest choice is the [dye packs](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Jubilant_Dye_Pack).  Just search for them on the wiki, sort by price, then pick the ones you like best.
---
If you think you'll buy gems eventually, then the Ultimate edition is a good value.  I would prioritize buying the Living World season packs, as they are currently on sale.  After that I'd definitely pick up a Copper-Fed Salvage-o-Matic.  Maybe some bank tabs or character slots, depending on your preferences.
---
I'd wait and grab some form of [unlimited gathering tools](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gathering_tool#Unlimited_Gathering_Tools_2) once they go on sale, most likely in March.
---
For perspective, FFXIV has actual millions of players, and if you're queuing as a dps your dungeon wait times are usually 10+ min. This is likely because of the class based queuing, but in the grand scheme waiting 10 min either way feels the same. Lack of players or lack of tanks queueing, you still wait.
---
It sounds like you're trying to make a good thing sound bad because you're unhappy with the state of the game.
---
Birthday ones last for 24h each.

Can't see other way to do it.

Wow I really can't go a single thread without FF14 shiling.
---
Yes, FF14 dungeons are so great. Enjoy your literal linear hallways of aoe - &gt; boss -&gt; aoe - &gt; boss with zero difficulty(somehow less than gw2's dungeons and non-cm fractals!) that have not changed in design since 2.0.
---
Enjoy going from 1 story MMO that you complain about being a story MMO to another story MMO with even less to do! Yay!
---
See, ANet?
---
Colin had already tried to sell the concept of "an expansion worth of content" more than **five years ago** and not only were you forced to change your model suddenly by announcing the LS2 and then rushing HoT as soon as possible with cut content all around, no: you also have a two years long black hole of content called LS1 that keeps alienating new players who have no idea what the fuck is going on when they finish Arah and are greeted by a band of chucklefucks who they are apparently buddies with. You know, ruining their enjoyment of the story, which is **the only thing you seem to care about** aside from sucking your players dry.
---
&gt; I assumed they were just bored while waiting for the match to start.
---
Your assumptions were probably correct.
---
The gem has a level requirement.
---
Me and some friends are starting with the game soon, and I'm trying to decide between Ranger and Mesmer for a support role. I really like the mechanics of both and am leaning more towards Mesmer, but I'm worried that it might be a bit too complicated for a new player. It seems to have a lot going on. Thoughts?
---
I know. Its level 80 and im level 80...
---
It is criminally underrated tbh , since you have enough burst as other power classes and you can reset your F1 so easily on so many fractals . So yea , it is great .
---
the item you slot the gem in has to be this level
---
Finally getting into GW2 and really enjoying playing through the story.... we‚Äôll see about end game.
---
The whole map and meta system are fun for now but like you said not noob friendly. It‚Äôs pretty obtuse as to what/when/why I‚Äôm suppose to do them
---
One of my biggest gripes though (coming from WoW) is the lack of mod API, I know some people have created things like Arcdps, but I‚Äôd really like to have more customization over things like bag management, Skill/unit frames UI etc... but I suppose that would defeat a lot of their potential revenue making possibilities (looking at you build templates).
---
&gt; We have famous players, but you have to be involved in a game mode to know the famous players of this one. 
---
Name 5 that haven't quit yet, and are still optimistic about the game.
---
I can think of maybe 1... WoodenPotatoes, and his viewership still pales in comparison to the "famous players" in other mmos
---
Well that's understandable: the first couple of days people were logged out if anyone would change build in their vicinity and then throughout the first week everyone and their aunt had a surge of disconnections.
---
The game was nothing short of unplayable. 
---
Even now, after two weeks, there is still no sign of fix for all the issues with legendaries and Revenant skills. Of course people get fed up and go play something else.
---
It's not gonna happen i'm afraid. The rework of the shaterer would be enough proof, people go there, get their achievements and then they quit because it's too much of a hasle to do the event for an ussually not worth enough event. I mean, the boss will be abandoned by the masses unless it can be easily done with the typical unorganized pugs. I mean, it would have to be the same difficulty level as Tequatl.
---
So, it's more of a ramp or incline and not a hoppable ledge then. Sounds like my original statement had it covered.
---
Unfortunately it takes a lot of time for a new management to actually give any meaningful results. I'm cautiously optimistic like you (mostly due to the PvP and WvW teams being somewhat communicative) but this template situation is making me more cynical than I'd like.
---
Looks like an extra beefy Kratos
---
Don't ask questions. Just consume product, and then get excited for next product.
---
Well, it feels like we are being ignored... Hopefully they will answer to our feedback sooner than later, and they should have answered a long time ago... the templates are just unfinished, and we shouldn't be charged with money for QoL update...
---
For sure.
---
The same thing happens in FFXIV too when in a 24-man raid or large open-world hunt mobs. If you get unlucky and get a few status effect classes, you can hit the cap and yours won't get applied at all. Probably because the game is running off of the original FFXIV engine. They've known it's an issue from day one, but they can't do anything about it.
---
What you're talking about isn't the combat system... It's the dmg output and balance. I think you're mistaking that stuff for the combat system. 
---
That other stuff you mentioned isn't the combat either it's the teams' playing and their strategy. You definitely have to pay attention to what skills you are using. If you are just mashing buttons to win you either have bots, match riggers or at a very basic PvP rank. 
---
The skills have in-depth effects that require paying attention and knowing how to use them properly. So I have no idea what you're going on here.
---
I don't know how the fuck they did it. After EOTN's release with no new major content to follow up, the game just managed to stand on its own for years. I missed out on its heyday to be sure as I started around 2008, but damn those were some solid times.
---
Those soulbeast gloves are truly the most hideous skin they have ever created. Nice job.
---
Started playing week 1 as well. I definitely met a lot of cool people along the way, but the way the game was structured, you had this feeling that the game wasn't really designed around getting everyone to meet up for stuff as much. Nothing close to The Deep or FoW runs. I mean okay, maybe the devs didn't intend for us to join Ooze Pit or Kath runs run by a monk or an assassin for the rest of group, but it still got people meeting up regularly for stuff.
---
Well i don't know any Wow youtuber, streamer or... and gw2 isn't marketized so it doesn't help to break the bridge
---
Where is this even from?
---
Mesmer is quite complicated for a new player, but it is also the more in-demand support overall (to be specific we are talking about the Chronomancer elite spec). Ranger is very new player friendly, and Druid is still a good support overall, but it hasn't been in the limelight as much lately.
---
That might give you more questions than answers, but hopefully it helps you decide. :)
---
MO recently admitted he was starting to work on a sequel to GW2 (he never formally called it GW3), but left.  
---
But who knows though. I have a hunch it falls on NCSoft to greenlight it and provide some capital.
---
Damage output is part of the combat system. Of combat is over in a flash then your combat system seriously stinks. You could have tried to build the greatest system you could think of, but if when it‚Äôs implemented, there‚Äôs no use strategizing because of how fast combat is over then your combat system really sucks.
---
&gt;The skills have in-depth effects that require paying attention and knowing how to use them properly. So I have no idea what you're going on here.
---
Just because the skills have in-depth effects doesn‚Äôt mean they matter all that much when it comes into practice, I finished in plat enough times before quitting PvP to know that it‚Äôs not that deep. You just have to play the right class with the right build and spam your skills faster than the enemy.
---
You can stack up anything that gives that same buff, too. So you can pop 4 birthday boosters and that would be 4 days worth. You can also add on regular celebration boosters and it will stack duration on top of the birthday ones. XP Boosters work the same way.
---
I've seen that norn before, even shared a SS of him with my guild mates. Hilarious lol 
---
But watching him with that facial expression makes it even better
---
Actual templates.
---
Who haven't left, it's hard but that's because the game doesn't release new content outside living story, and living story isn't something you can made a lot of videos of, engage a community on.
---
The eraser doesn't do beige, it is the default colors (which in your case are beige apparently). If the item sent was dyed with non-standard colors then there's no way to figure out what they are unless you still have it dyed, in that case just hover over the color slots and it will tell you what is currently in the slot.
---
I love that the first two comments on this link to the same image almost at the same time.
---
Im refering to poe 2 and what they try to do with that. Apparently soke performance updates are also comming with 3.9.

That's all balance. Not the actual system; as it can be ajusted with tweeks.

I completely forgot about the timing for everything so I casually checked /r/pathofexile yesterday and saw EVERYTHING.

---
Not really much to prepare for with this one. I'd be familar with the strike mission we currrently have but that's about it. If you like story and lore maybe read up a little bit on norn culture? Have some xp boosters to fill up your masteries quicker never hurts either. But for the most part, it's safe to go in blind to this one I reckon! :)
---
You are gearing a level 80 character, please use an at least exotic level 80 amulett. Your amulett give +1 on 4 stats. A level 80 exotic amulett gives +102 +102 +56 +56 on 4 stats or +120 +85 +85 on 3 stats.
---
GW2 is a traditional MMO, GW1 is more advanced as a teamgame. Depends what your focus is: for single player open world content is GW2 better suited. For coop gameplay (which many guilds, teams, family&amp;friends are interested in) is GW1 still far ahead of GW2.

Woah, what an insightful question from a fresh new account, it totally would not have a very predictable set of baited replies, would it?
---
Dunno, I missed most of S1 and I enjoyed it and I love those chucklfucks....
---
I'm scared to even ask but... What bug?
---
Bond of vigor on the beetle tho.
---
The problem with the LS1 approach was that after everything was over there is nothing to show for it.  It didn't leave the game with additional content equivalent to the amount of work and resources that went into making it.
---
pro or against anet? i cant tell anymore
---
Nope. The only time-limited BL key is the level 10 personal story reward, which is once per week per account (resets at I think 3:30am EST Monday morning). Beyond that, you can farm the level 40 and level 60 keys as often as you want, as well as the Into The Labyrinth key reward which you need to be level 80 to do.
---
I recently decided to spend my stacks of tomes and leveling scrolls by key farming. If you choose the right paths, you can run up through the level 60 personal story (The Battle of Claw Island) within about 2 hours. Into The Labyrinth takes about 20 minutes to complete, so for about 2.5 hours you can have 3 keys (or 4, if you haven't done your level 10 key for the week), at the cost of just 30-40 tomes and a level 40 or 50 experience scroll.
---
In addition to the keys, you get a small handful of boosters and a decent amount of low- to mid-tier materials from the level-up rewards. It's not a terrible way to use up those stacks of tomes that are otherwise useless.
---
The level requirement is not for YOUR level. It's for the ITEM's level. Polla isn't level 80.
---
Same, never seen a bot in EU Pvp.
---
I know that.
---
Why's this community so aggressive?
---
 Im not saying anything bad and getting downvoted like crazy wtf.
---
You're absolutely right, and I agree with you there. As I understand it, that's also exactly why Anet abandoned that model. It doesn't make sense to invest time and resources into content that will only exist and be experienced by a small fraction of the entire playerbase you're trying to cater to.
---
Some friends and I have brainstormed methods for them to integrate that LS1 content into the game itself (potentially through the use of a fractal-like system), but it's probably unlikely that anything will ever be done on that front since it would require investing resources into old content that would today mostly just exist as a filler. Anet is better off spending those resources on new content moving forward as opposed to looking back.
---
They've been making performance updates for years. It hasn't always gone down well with the players. Do you remember the backlash when they removed the settings for shadows when using DirectX 9?
---
It's hypocritical to use GGG as an example to bash ANet while ignoring the flaws of the former.
---
You can't bash ANet for removing negative feedback while GGG removes bad rep from a vouch thread and actively protects scammers. You can't say that ANet doesn't listen to what the players want while GGG outright ignores all the requests for a better trading experience.
---
And, perhaps most importantly, you can't compare the development hurdles of an MMO with a mostly single player experience, or a model based on horizontal progression with content that resets every 3 months and doesn't care about long-term balance.
---
I see plenty of people with more masteries than I've hairs on my taint, wielding eleventy four legendaries and with the survivability of an idiot's convictions and none of them behave like bots, mostly because the only way to kill them is to do so when they make a mistake.
---
Anet's forum mods are garbage, they remove all posts that are negative.
---
As someone who left the game very near launch only to come back in 2014, I can say that it's been very frustrating to see that line of thinking permeate the community as if it were acceptable.
---
I played constantly as the ramp up to and subsequent launch of HoT finally hit. I never played so much PvE, WvW, and PvP as I ded from then through to when PoF hit. PoF saw me do almost exclusively WvW or PvP formats since the story of the xpack was weak, although LWS4 was my favorite in recent memory. 
---
5600ish hours later here I am, taking a hiatus from GW2 until they launch the next episode this coming week. This is not ideal and I'm very frustrated at the speed and volume of releases since PoF and between each expansion in general. I'm tired of devouring content peanuts every 2-4 months, but theres the added problem of not finding another mmo I like more... /sigh I like the world, the story even, and a lot of the mechanics, its just..  sogoddamned slow to update!
---
I agree with a lot of what you wrote, but here are my areas of disagreement.
---
2. The skin comment. Guild Wars 1 was the same way. What other rewards are there? Minis and tonics. Infusions. That's about it. Why? Because we don't want the power creep of ever increasing gear stats. It's a selling feature of this game and many of us are here because of that.  Guild Wars 1 was the same way. Also you don't keep skins in your inventory. You delete them. I don't know about you but I have a ton of tranmutation charges after all these years, well over a thousand. Not worried about deleting some skins, to make room in my wardrobe.
---
3. I've found strategies that work for keeping my inventory clear. It's a bit annoying but not a major point since I worked it out. Loot boxes by the way, which stack, was originally a strategy to manage drops. Blues and greens and rares don't stack. Loot boxes do, so you could keep them and store them until you're ready to open them with less room taken in your inventory.
---
7. Lack of famous players? Most of the playerbase doesn't know who famous players are when they're around. Most players don't come to reddit or forums. Is this really a complaint about the game? I can't imagine why this matters. At the very least it doesn't matter to me, not at all. 
---
There are other minor points, but these are the major ones.
---
anet doing same shit over and over? shocking.
---
Both are pretty easy to pick up and essentially have nothing to do with their support roles in endgame as chrono/druid. Mesmer is harder to master though, but by that time you'll get used to the game and class anyway.
---
I'm sure anet could do as well but for whatever reason they decided to ditch big cool new things and rather add the what worked for the last few years formula.
---
But that's what you're asking for.
---
&gt;Yet another fantastic example of why this game should have 'hide other players mount / item skins'
---
That is already a thing, it doesn't hide the player it just makes them a generic adventurer with the default mount skin.
---
&gt; WAY better. What Blizzard did with OW2 is a dick move, but hey, they were the ones who "invented" subscription model + cash shop after all. OW2 is no more than an expansion being sold at the price of a full game.
---
Don't really want to get into an OW argument here but we don't even know how much content OW2 will have so I don't see how it can be disparaged as a dick move yet.
---
Man, heterochromia asura would be awesome
---
&gt; I'm curious as to whether the changes in the company makeup and leadership will make a difference.
---
I continue to state that I don't see why it would improve, you're moving from people who had a passion for the game, despite the issues, to company personnel who are far more likely to toe te NCSoft company line.
---
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/southpark/images/c/c8/PC_Babies_BuddhaBox.png/revision/latest?cb=20181213143311
---
Hilariously, it still applies after two changes in game director (Colin to Mike O to Mike Z). I can't shake the feeling that ANet had no idea what to do with their game after Colin left.
---
I mean, it's impossible that in a company of 200+ people no one had any vision for the future of their main game (and source of income) for five years. Maybe they really did stop caring?
---
Dunno why you used quotes, the feature in its entirety is free and saying otherwise doesn't change that. None of us had to pay for the system and it is fully useable just incredibly inconvenient, even if you buy slots its inconvenient because of how it was designed(or not designed) to work with certain aspects of the game. There is no free version or paid version, there's just an incredibly buggy system that adds more inconvenience than it solves.
---
Well you made the post asking why it wasn't working. (shrug)
---
&gt; amount of content and changes that goes into these 3 month patches,
---
Important fact too, the new content GGG adds every 3 months is almost all endgame content and aimed at their most dedicated veteran players. Anet focuses their quarterly content releases at players who log in for 4 hours per year and have the gameplay skills to match.
---
Sloth love Chunk.
---
That sounds great. I am very optimistic and can't wait for the changes you will bring.
---

Additional pieces can be crafted using the recipes gained from the same achievement(s). Each piece requires 25 Mistborn Mote. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Shard_armor
---
Festivals last 22 days, 16 envelopes per day. Have to send 352g to the alt.
---
You get recipes and you can craft some. You can also buy the blossoming version of the armor from the volatile magic vendor near the first waypoint once you've unlocked one.   They require spirit shards, mistborn motes and ectos.
---
Oh ok, thanks.
---
Makes me think of Bioware, if I recall one of the problems with Anthem was that the people in charge at the start of the project left or were reassigned and the people left calling the shots just didn't have a coherent vision or were incapable of pushing for it.  
---
It's almost like the teams went on auto-pilot, and like an aircraft can stay in flight a long time on auto-pilot the teams kept doing what they were doing.  
---
But in the end you need somebody behind the stick to land the aircraft and you need somebody with a vision to launch a good game.  
---
Cause eventually the plane is out of fuel and the Development teams are out of money...
---
For what? Spirit shards are only really used for very specific purposes like crafting a legendary, and even then you're going to need only a couple hundred.
---
I'm currently sitting on 4,960 spirit shards and despite my many attempts to find something worthwhile to spend them on, I've never found anything that will turn a profit or provide me any sorts of benefits at all, really. Once upon a time you could make a *slight* profit by upgrading WvW siege blueprints but those days are long gone. If you find a valid use for a massive amount of shards, please tell me. Spirit banners are the best thing I can find to use them on, and those are only 25 shards per banner. You don't even really need to put those up very often either, because banners are all over the world these days.
---
Considering you get a spirit shard every single time you level up after 80, and you only get tomes from a select few sources in the game, I would argue that it's better to save the tomes for situations like key farming, or using them to level alts or new characters to 80. 
---
After you hit level 80 on your main character and start doing tons of map metas, fractals, dungeons, or anything really, you'll notice that you "level up" multiple times per session and really start accruing spirit shards much faster than you could possibly spend them.
---
Though I'm pretty sure they still cap out at 1 week so don't spam them all!
---
You are missing the point. All the points, actually. There are a million reasons why GW1's situation is completely different.
---
&gt; But classic wow is litterally the opposite of a development
---
They are actively fixing bugs and rolling out content in stages, also banning people who deserve it. That's development.
---
&gt; What attracts people to WoW classic is not the type of game it is, it's primarily nostalgia and the ability for newer players to experience the birth of wow
---
Those players have quit months ago, yet Blizzard's revenue report says Classic is going strong with no real dropoff over the months.
---
&gt; People have access to the GW1 experience, but there clearly isn't a market for it
---
They have access to it. Sure. But at what state?
---
Classic works because it's not a project that was gathering dust for a decade with Blizzard neglecting it. Classic is a fresh start. GW1 is stale.

There were hundreds of thousands of people watching the "world first" Molten Core race, eventhough it's been cleared 15 years ago and is braindead easy. Yet in a sense, it's new. Everything is new. People get to race and compete for things that hold value. Meanwhile almost everything is worthless in GW1 now.

Rank 15 title for example in HA used to be such a big deal, only 5-6 people had it. Everyone knew who they were. Now several botters who can't even PvP have it too.. Would people be able to get back into this game and push for high ranks? Sure. Would there be a point to it? Absolutely not. On the other hand if GW1 got re-released, everyone would be rank 0 and the race to rank 15 would be back in full force. See the difference? This is a problem in every area of GW1 right now, most things have lost value over the years of neglect.

People are returning to GW1 every day. Most just don't have a reason to stick around because they don't have goals anymore.

For vanilla WoW to go somewhere, players needed Blizzard. Since we don't have the tools to make private servers, we need Anet even more.

&gt; I think poeple need to realise that gw1 is not som hidden gem, or ground breaking experince that has a giant market of untapped potential.

Oh right, because you said so. That changes everything! /s

Scarlet was not complex, she was fanfiction tier at best.

Thank you, I hope that my comment made you exhale from your nose at some velocity.

The only things I find fun after 3 years of play are metas (specifically the HoT ones), fractals, and dungeons (they're still great). Raids are too hard and time consuming, and I'm terrible at competitive stuff. What rewards do I want? I want some of that cash store shit to be earn able in game through quests like the griffin collection. I want cool skins that are earnable.

Agree, it‚Äôs not a stream friendly game like the FPS games or wow

GW2 has many problems but them complaining about mega servers lying to them makes me question the sanity of these veterans.

I'm more intriguied about why is there a toy broom in your shared inventory? Since they made the whole shared account bound system for the novelties, why still keep it there..?

IIRC it happened in 2013.  I'll try to find an article aboot it!
---
Edit: I haven't found anything yet but I found this hilariously relevant post from 2014: http://dulfy.net/2014/06/05/gw2-developers-are-looking-into-build-templates/

Edit2: Sorry, I wasn't able to find the incident on their forums or elsewhere.  At the time (beta till 2015) I was in a guild which had a number of anet employees (qa mostly) in it, so I am wondering if I am remembering something they told the guild which wasn't public knowledge?  IIRC the incident was with an employee on the official forums talking to players in a very unprofessional way (ie. might've been akin to flaming).  What doesn't help is that several forum posts are no longer available (lead to 404 / not found when linking from google result).

Or, you know, the **Shiverpeak** mount set lol...

underwater mount which also can be used on land, because skins sell.
