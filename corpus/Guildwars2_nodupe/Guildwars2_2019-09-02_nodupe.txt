After all, you can only send so many messages in a certain time frame. :P

it is but wow has a giant ass pop , gw2 does not, that's why neither of them release sub mode. except they dont come, everyone thinks the game is dead and ppl who tried it early said its garbage. You find 1 filled map for every event on ET , not 3-4 like before, 1
---
Hello there, my friend. 
---

---
Anet here, and yes and expansion is coming very soon. Thank you for playing the game, also buy more gems.
---
But there are MORE events. So the event that's not filling 3 servers now in AB is not an indication of anything because we have so many more maps AND events. Sure less people are running each meta, when there are more metas.  PoF metas are getting done now. So you have more things to split the player base. You can't tell from that how large the player base is.  Not unless you have a snapshot from the top down seeing every player in every area. We know populations are down in WvW, that much we do know. But again, you have to look at all players across all servers. With WvW you can do that. You can't with PvE.
---
English stands as the most necessary language to learn nowadays. I'm not a native speaker and I still can't feel bad for anyone that is too lazy to learn what is essentially the language of *the world*
---
I'm fairly certain the S5 episodes will still be unlocked by logging in during the window, but you'll ALWAYS get the prologue episode if you own the PoF expansion.
---
even if they didn't give us any of this information, I'd settle for them just telling us if the money NCSoft gave them for the now-cancelled projects was money NCSoft would have given them to increase GW2 development. a simple answer to that question would go a long way towards determining how I should feel about GW2's progress and decision-making. 
---
if that funding was just earmarked by NCSoft for the other project, then I don't feel so bad about Anet's progress on GW2, since it could just a problem of lack of funding. however, if Anet would have received that portion of funds regardless, then I'd be upset they chose to skimp on GW2 to waste money on the other project.
---
"toxic" is a buzzword used to play victim
---
They may have hinted at it using the term saga instead of the living world season.
---
The way they treated it is pretty ambiguous. All we can do is wait and see.  That's the most logical step instead of raging or calling the game dead.
---
Oh we do have years before the game goes down. And while I'm a PvP/fractal player I do enjoy living world a lot. My biggest worry is that this revenue thing might lead to more aggressive monetization. Only time will tell that though. 
---
To be fair however, I do a lot of open world and the living world content has started to feel repetitious as well. I'm not speaking just a PvP player.
---
Most devs cherry pick who they want to listen to and which issues they want to address publicly (which doesn't necessarily mean your concern hasn't been heard though).
---
Unless there's a truly massive outrage where such a large percentage of the playerbase comes together as to make it a "game over" type of deal should it get ignored (like the Jita Protests in EVE Online) the devs own the conversation in large part and even devs with the a very community friendly reputation will use that to their advantage to wipe things under the rug on occasion.
---
The difference, of course, being that good devs will get away with it due to community goodwill, while devs that have already used up their goodwill will just create a sourer and sourer environment.
---
As to other players reacting poorly to polite critique, calling someone "toxic" (or any other ad-hominem, really) is just a cop-out because they don't want to hear the actual argument, they don't want to hear there is a problem with the game (or the devs). In my experience this is most often done by players in the "honeymoon" stage, where they're still in love with the game and everything is perfect to them, anything that threatens to shatter this bubble is considered a threat and they respond in kind.
---
You made my day with this reply :)
---
I just received mine now. Don't be in too much of a hurry, it's pretty underwhelming. There is the glider skin which I don't mind. But the "Armour Pack" is not a full set. It is a choice of a collection of masks and such. These are not even a permanent wardrobe unlock, they are all single use items.
---
When I bought HoT I paid $35 for content I hated. I still hate it all to this day with the exception of AB. Sigh....
---
I agree with you, about the money situation. We might see more aggressive monetization and that is absolutely a worry.  And yes, anything I do for 10,000 hours feels repetitive.  I don't see how that's a judge of anything. I felt the same about Guild Wars 1 six years in.
---
Yea, I'm not sure how this ends well for Rubi.  I like the lady so I'd hate to see her get in trouble but you're right.  The twitter bio ties her to Anet, just like Price, and that was part of why Price got canned.
---
Orders of magnitude difference in what was said, tho.  I really hope Rubi is fine when this is all said and done.
---
Feels bad man
---
&gt;i remember back in the day they'd engage in reddit conversations, give us some feedback, hype stuff
---
As a lot of us tried to warn you all back at the time, the lynch mob calling for Jessica Price to be fired wasn't going to accomplish anything other than making sure that no dev will ever talk to the fan base again unless the company is forcing them to do it and tell them what to say.
---
Oh cool, thank you.
---
Are no more elite specs really a possibility? I thought it was a stable, and logical means of adding classes to the game. 
---
If it's something that could really happen I don't know what else they could do as a substitution.
---
You could easily build a support-loss-tolerant composition where everyone supplies boons. It's more engaging and makes more sense to min-max by dedicating support roles to classes that can output a lot of support *stuff* at once, since they need to gear Concentration to do so.
---
If they actually give a substantial response that answers all the big questions I'll pee in my own mouth
---
People ask for that AND FOR THEM TO DELIVER.
---
You completely disregarded that point to, as usual, pin the blame on the playerbase.
---
Well, I mean, people go there for karka queen, and I see karka shell farming parties fairly regularly when I go for KQ.  As for letting one map be used for multiple releases, is that what we want....or do we want a farm that's as good as Silverwastes.  Would people still be there if it wasn't such a great farm?  Would LS3 be as good if we were stuck exploring bloodstone fen, or LS4 if we were stuck in Istan?  Looking back on it, Dry top and silverwastes seem a little clausterphobic.  I do agree that HoT would've been immensely improved if the had revealed the maps over a 6 month period.  (at release we only get VB, 2 months later, AB, 2 months td, 2 months DS)
---
The more I see this happening to Guild Wars 2, the more I wish Digital Extremes would buy off/work with Anet.   
---
They CLEARLY have their shit together with Warframe. Always listening and responding positively  to the community. While they do have cash shop stuff, everything is attainable in game (just a bit grindy). TAKE HEED ANET!
---
Yeah I've been using that glyph since it was released.
---
And yet, people wonder why anet never talks to us...
---
I'm considering resubbing to WoW for classic. That's how little I care to play this anymore.
---
What is the context about phones.?
---
&gt; No i dont personally attack them
---
Cool then don't take it so personally. 
---
&gt; Medina pretty much said we ‚ÄúNEED‚Äù to give kudos. 
---
He said in context (of the layoffs) they didn't do so bad and that should part of the communities consideration.
---
&gt; After Anet fails to focus on a problem and takes the time to call a player base toxic and harassing, who cares, if its that big of problem take your employees internet privileges away . 
---
Didn't realize employees were slaves who can't talk about personal stuff on the weekends, or want more decency in the community. 
---
&gt; Im still waiting on the ‚ÄúExpansion Worthy Hype‚Äù i was told about aswell. 
---
I dont disagree with you there, but if you are bugging devs personal Twitter's over it and harassing them then it's not okay. That's what they are saying. But a Dev isn't gonna drop big news on the weekend. We will get news, just wait till Tuesday.
---
lol yeah your response was a lot more informative than mine.
---
Can you link some posts to back up your statement? I'm genuinely curious since I haven't seen anything abusive or extremely toxic.
---
after friday‚Äôs fiasco and now people don‚Äôt even know what owls are. the darkest timeline indeed
---
&gt;Starting with episode one. That mastery line will actually evolve and grow into episode two and if you're wondering what that is, it is actually going to be exploring the history of the norn deities called the Spirits of the Wild and for episode one the first spirit is going to be the raven spirit.
---
Because dev says it's raven.
---
:(
---
But we also have this https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Owl_Spirit_(object) which might as well be Owl herself very much alive since it follows the naming convention of https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Minotaur_Spirit which even appeared in the personal story
---
But anet was super inconsistent with the Spirits of the Wild and their name so who knows
---
No worries. It was more of a jab at fooz being under the impression that what you said was some obscure ancient knowledge.
---
Your delete later?
---
Same!
---
Might* love me some autocorrect üò¨
---
Two poopy gem store items, but at least they're free.
---
That is a reference to the Diablo Immortals announcement, where people were expecting a Diablo 4 announcement and they got a Diablo mobile version instead.
---
NO YOU LISTEN
---
People kept pestering him and asking him over and over about a few different things, that included. They kept pestering him about base building too and he said no every time. Sure, he lied about it, but it's also possible it was a bug or they planned to incorporate it shortly after launch before thinking (tbh I have no idea on that).
---
I'm not saying Hello Games is completely innocent, but they got a LOT of shit for not including features that Sean insisted over and over and over again would not be in the game, and they had no plans to add it in DLC, like ATVs. And they eventually DID add this stuff in as free DLC and people STILL bitched about how it wasn't in it from the beginning. They got enough hate for things they never should have gotten hate for, plenty enough to make up for the stuff they legitimately failed on.
---
You clever bastard
---
I am using Gtx 1080Ti SLI, does it work and utilize 2 GPU well???
---
haha got suspended in the forum. &gt;.&lt; well now i can talk more about it in depth in our youtube videos.
---
This is a very... touchy subject. They had the massive unexpected layoffs earlier this year and when that happened us as a community thought the game was done &amp; needed a funeral. They use to communicate a lot via reddit and for a while there few months back I was hoping for more communication cause that's what they were showing at the time. Then it stopped. I don't fully understand the reason to hype such a thing as the new trailer but hey, we got the new saga? (Wish they would have detailed more on saga) on the way. It's a future. I feel bad for wvw, pvp, raiders, hell anyone that doesn't do just story mode..
---
Daddy, no!
---
I'm kinda scared to use my second armor chest because I'm not sure its intended to receive a second one? I'm waiting for an official response.
---
Crafting stations give access to the bank though
---
Just because we will be exploring Raven's history in Ep1 doesn't mean the bird featured in the trailer is Raven. Especially because it is *literally not a raven are you blind.*
---
And after they spoiled EVERYTHING then you will complain that they spoiled too much or they wont hold their promises lol xD
---
S2 is just the rewards and story (which you can join another player for) the maps (drytop and silverwastes) were added into the core game just like southsun.
---
Mine does not have an option to add to the wardrobe. It specifically states "one time use only". I did look. This is what it says. Unless this is (another) bug. Which I guess is possible. I will see if this changes when I log out again.
---
TBH, the only thing I can think of is that they had something else they intended to drop, some sort of big piece of news, and had to change it at the last minute. 
---
&gt;MERCHANDISE
---
Not even good merchandise ffs.
---
This is just another "enjoy the game like me or leave".
---
I dunno if you meant well, OP, but it's a message repeated ad nauseam, and replied likewise.
---
Keeping it short, people care about the game and that's the reason they're vocal. If you don't act you can't expect a change.
---
There‚Äôs a lot of interesting discussion regarding roadmaps.  I thought I‚Äôd add my 2 cents to this topic.  
---
The reason why the company will not deliver a road map is quite simple.  If they delivered one, people would know 12 months in advance that they aren‚Äôt going to deliver meaningful content and then stop playing for a year.  
---
With the current strategy, since people don‚Äôt know what will actually be delivered, they‚Äôd effectively have to log in or ‚Äúwait for the reviews on reddit‚Äù.  Factor in the ‚Äúexciting content coming soon‚Äù marketing and they might actually pull in decent player numbers for the update.  
---
In actuality, not having a roadmap and failing to managing customer expectations is bad project management.  I have 8 years‚Äô experience in software development.  In layman‚Äôs terms, a Project Manager is literally paid to ‚Äúbuild a road map‚Äù and ‚Äúmanage the customers/stakeholders‚Äù.  For big software projects, you absolutely need a Project Manager if you want to succeed.  For smaller projects, you can get away with just a Business Analyst doing some project stuff on the side.  
---
Considering the bulk of ANet‚Äôs problems have generally been Project Management related, it is clear they don‚Äôt have a proper Project Manager.  I suspect their Project Manager is either an ex-developer with no Project Management qualifications or a Business Analyst doing project stuff on the side.
---
I'm sorry to hear that no one cared about the abuse you faced during your job. No one should have to deal with that.
---
Analogies aren't meant to be taken literally. You have a relationship with a game. It's obviously not a marriage. It's a basic form of English.
---
I kinda like glider, for some reason.
---
Same. Now I can finally unlock 2 of those glowing masks that I'll use for a day and then get tired of them.
---
That was added later, as a QoL update.
---
In lore they are different services.
---
All this, I really hope we get more elaborate things involved in whats to come as well!
---
Really? You want specifics? The subreddit has been nigh-exclusively complaints of all kinds for the past months. Literally anything that happened these past few months other than 500 cooking has been regarded as a fuckup.
---
Rubi's tweets are.... fine. They're disappointing, they're definitely not what the community wants to see as (currently) the sole feedback from the community, but they're completely fine answers to address a precise recurring problem.
---
Price's tweets were outright vicious for no discernible reason *and* were a direct followup to her posting work-related stuff on her personal twitter account. Trying to equate the two as if they were even remotely similar situations is *incredibly* disingenuous.
---
Genocide is unforgivable. Anything Arenanet has done is totally forgivable.
---
That statement was made a while back. I'm talking strictly about the weeks just before the event on 8/30. They only said that it would be about living world.
---
And? People have every right to complain if they want to? Complaining isn't abusive or toxic.
---
If they aren't playing and they are complaining... Well, that ridiculous.
---
Also, what assumptions?
---
- metas
---
- hearts
---
- champ events
---
- bounties
---
- node farms
---
I used taco for the nodes after I'm done with my character hearts and I try to do a meta or a champ event at least 2-3 times for the currencies. 
---
U get an extra 25 of the currency if you complete the map.
---
Buying the expansion from retailers is not illegal, neither from official partners nor others. You might get trouble if you get an illegally acquired or sold key, for example through an online marketplace. I can not recommend choosing a retailer at the moment though, since Arenanet does for some reason not extend the courtesy of offer refunds for recent purchases of Heart of Thorns to those players who bought the expansion from retailers. If you bought the expansion 1 day before it was included with Path of Fire, you get basically nothing but the 30‚Ç¨ glider skin, while someone who bought it from the Guild Wars 2 site gets either his money back or gems as in-game compensation. I do not know why they penalize people for choosing retailers so harshly.
---
i like blizzard in which they do beta testing.  gw2? well, how in the world are they not utilizing free labor?
---
guess alpha testers get paid for this and dont want their job outsourced to players who do better and for free.
---
makes you wonder if an arenanet owner checks the internal workings of his/her mechanism.
---
ncsoft someone?
---
For Istan, you can do meteorite Farm if there's any squad still doing it.
---
For any Lws4 map do the hearts on multiple characters and map's meta.
---
If you're going hardcore, some of the Lws4 map also gives currency for map completion.

People invest in friendships, guilds and various relationships here.  You're telling people to leave all that behind.  I've watched multiple discord servers dry up over the past year; and with them, the hope of staying connected to people I consider good friends.  It's really sad to see people go from excited to hang out and play GW2 to excited every 3 months for 2-3 weeks to, "I miss ThePillsburyDoughBoy."  I have a few friends that still play the game, but they pretty much login almost exclusively for raids or fractals; and it doesn't last.
---
&gt; There‚Äôs those who can express their opinions and critcism of the game in a constructive and civil manner, then there are the ***few*** toxic posts.
---
FTFY. Because let‚Äôs be honest, most if not every toxic post here gets downvoted or taken down. If there‚Äôs random users harrasing the Devs then sadly they‚Äôll have to block them.  But you‚Äôre throwing some very shady stuff, like
---
&gt;There are better ways to convey frustration than with posts like ‚Äùfuck Anet‚Äù or ‚Äùwe demand xyz NOW‚Äù
---
I‚Äôd be surprised if you could find 3 or even one post that is toxic that hasn‚Äôt been downvoted into oblivion or taken down by the mods. All of the top voted posts are constructive critism and we can‚Äôt controll individual toxic users who goes to personally harass the devs. I understand your point but at the same time you‚Äôre focusing mostly on a minority and not addresing any other problems that needs to urgently be talked about.
---
You just named.the biggest mmos of the past 20 years that market raids as something they do well and called that content niche. Not everyone plays them but its great marketing for the game. It gets a lot of players in from other games, similar to how top twitch streamers play at a different level than most but people still play the games they do.
---
You completely ignored what I said about erp as well. Niche content has drawn an order of magnitude times more players than any open world.
---
Imagine being this angry about a children's entertainment product.
---
You live in  your skin. You are talking about this guy who has a following on Twitch. He's leaving the game. I guarantee you he's not on the radar of most players, even if he is on the radar of most players here. Reddit is NOT the player base of this game and never has been. The people here are generally harder core. They're generally people who are interested in the mechanics of the game and the behind the scenes of the game. Pretty sure most of the people who log in and play are still trying to figure out what a break bar is. 
---
You talk about Anet's respect for "the community". I assume you mean the reddit community. You're probably on reddit every day and you see all these videos and these complaints. But Anet brass who plans these events, they're probably NOT on reddit every day. They might have some idea of who Teapot is, and not much more. They certainly don't get his importance to a segment of the community.
---
Is it contempt or ignorance? Are they wilfully trying to hurt you or just not following the argument of this particularly subreddit?  Because that's a big difference.
---
I agree that certain areas of the game have been neglected for far too long and I agree that the community has a right to be angry but this kind of hyperbole helps no one.
---
Unless you can prove contempt, which makes no sense to me, I'd just as soon go with a lack of understanding. And this kind of post doesn't engender greater understanding. It's just a rant.
---
If I were Anet, I'd ignore this post too.
---
How about that same day in the many hours after the press conference was held or do they not work Fridays either? Or were they all busy booking another theater to announce their response to the response of their announcement?
---
Why you are out the refund window its there for a reason it may suck but why should they give leeway to you but say no to everyone else.
---
More like 1,5 - 2 years.
---
This is strange, after planting my first batch of seeds in my two gem store plots (purchased the day 500 cooking released), they kept regrowing w/o me doing anything. I decided to replace a few of them with some new seeds and today (first reset since re-planting) I found that the newly planted seeds are Open Soil. The few three I didn't touch successfully grew.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I think this is a bug, it was my understanding that they regrew every day with the last seed used.
---
Lump of Mistonium, can be annoying to obtain. The most southern Heart in the Jahai bluffs is super easy to get with the pick up item and Dummies. But the Rift events reward Mistonium, Per Character, they spawn in the same locations. Good Luck :)
---
So you're essentially saying that in order to have the right to complain about the game, you * need* to still be playing said game? That's utter BS and I'd be amazed if you haven't realized that yet.
---
More like they should tell us that exoansions and elite specs are off the table.
---
Glider looks awesome, that wasn't the point of my comment \[which people clearly thought it was\].
---
Any chance there's a banner image to use on steam? I'm still using one from HoT.
---
The impression that I got was that by calling it a saga it doesn't lock them into the same kind of regular full episode releases. They might be able to go a few months without a major update but put some smaller stuff in an already existing map somewhere or to create some new current event and it would count as part of the "saga."
---
I just don't find PvE repetitive I guess. Obviously if you're farming Silver Wastes or Istan, sure, but if you're leveling a character from 1 to 80 by actually playing the game and going through the world / story it feels very different every time you play.
---
These people are reaching as much as possible to convince themselves that everyone is wrong about ANet, i think it's time to start ignoring them.
---
If I pay someone's salary it's not entitled to ask if they will continue to make content I enjoy
---
Yea right I played ffxiv for like 300h. Open world exploration sucks deep balls, maps are vague and do not do not have any content, you can't even jump over a fence because everything is blocked by invisible walls, oh and also there are  barely any voices in the game because they have no money, despites not only having paid expansions but also monthly sub fee and outrageous 16‚Ç¨ costumes.  
---
You mention so much amazing activities. Well let's see, hunting is literally "kill underleveled boss in 5s and get little to no loot, repeat", palace of the dead is literally square rooms next to each other, pvp is bizarre as fuck, back when I played they also added Eureka, where your purpose is to kill mobs on the map, literally just that. I'm amazed of how everyone loves Ffxiv, despites it obviously putting all the effort into quantity, not the quality. The only thing ffxiv devs are good at are raid mechanics and crafting design. Nothing more. Game despites heavily supporting fashion lacks decent dyeing or customization. On market you cant place orders and can only purchase full stack of items. A lot of spells are completely unusable because devs just made them as quick filler. Diving and flying is useless, they only added it to hype up expansions. Story quests are pure torment "oh hey you need to visit that Fisher 500km away and speak with him, then return to me". How much quests does main storyline have so far? 300-400? Most of them just having NPCs talking some bullshit and sending you to speak with other NPCs? Races. They have humans, humans with cat ears, humans with horns, humans with bunny ears. Again. Quantity over quality. Throw all the shit into the game and hope it will catter to as many players as possible. Woohoo! Also as a side note, ffxiv is the only mmo where I have been sexually harassed   purely based off my characters look, got some bloke pissed off at me because I said that I dont want to do hunts(and he really insisted that I will do them with him) as well as starting full chat shitstorm because I assumed the gender of our raids tank. I moved on to gw2 and here I truly feel like I'm playing with actual people, not smiling happy effigies trying to take away my kidney.
---
I can answer this:
---
*  No, there is no expansion, that's why they didn't bring one up. They have no plans to go to an xpac.
---
*  WvW alliances is in the same place it has been and they have no idea when it's coming out and they still have no new information to give us since the last time, but maybe september they'll at least have a release date.
---
*  Elite specializations are not and were not ever coming with living story. 
---
*  Probably one more raid, just to test the waters after strikes, but it's probably not even being worked on.
---
The real answer to this is there is no good way. If you missed living world content you're screwed because the $60 expansion do not stand well on their own. They constantly reference other parts of the game and it will be difficult for you to understand quite a bit of it if you haven't experienced that material. The writers that work on the game aren't that great anyway. Even the main crew you run with was introduced in a Living World; which was a huge mistake. This meant that anyone who missed the introduction of these characters are stuck feeling like missed something. "Who are these people that seem to know me so well and consider me their friend and ally? Have I met them before?" You can never really shake that feeling, and in many people's cases it ruins immersion and creates a complete emotional disconnect from these characters you're obviously supposed to have a relationship with. 
---
I will say the final boss fight of HoT is infinitely better than the letdown of the base game. 
---
That being said. Every other aspect of the game outshines the story by a long shot. There is always something to do whether it's joining a train to farm the Silvereastes, jumping from place to place  doing meta events and world bosses, pvp, or getting a crew together to challenge yourselves 
---
With some fractals. 
---
It is worth playing, but don't expect much from the story if you missed living worlds. 
---
I know some will defend it saying you can still buy living worlds, but a expansion should be able to stand up on its on without assistance.
---
Well, my point isn't about the content of tweets, just that posting to your private twitter account isn't a shield against being accused of representing the company.  I'm not here to discuss what Price said, or to compare the content to what Rubi said.  Just that both of them were posting to their private account, and one was accused of representing anet, and thus, so should the other.
---
Oh shut up and stop being such a baby.
---
I don't play Warframe, so sadly none of the words there told me anything. :(
---
&gt; plan it out and release it slowly.
---
That's the thing. I'm sure actually scripting traits doesn't require much work. Most time investment comes from coming up with these ideas, testing and balancing them, and creating art assets for them. The first one is required in order to make any sort of actionable roadmap. The third one is not required for traits (only the trait icons), but it is required for skills and profession mechanics - something that needs to be released first anyway, so it's already a major initial investment. So we're only left with testing and balancing as things that can be partially neglected for the initial release and spread out over the course of the season. That's not a lot of savings, isn't it?
---
Now if especs were released one-by-one, then all the resources can be dedicated to fully developing 1 or 2 specs at a time. With developers moving onto further especs as the one they're currently working on is released. As a result, specs would get full attention and be able to be delivered in a manageable time, and even balancing them post-release would be easier because there wouldn't be 9 specs to balance right away, their number will gradually grow from 1 and upwards, but as the first ones will be in the game for longer, they'll see more balance patches and as such won't be in a critical need for balancing by the time 5th, 6th, 7th espec is released. The only downside is that, yes, players that main one class will have to wait, potentially quite a while. But my hope is that it would incentivize them to try out new classes as their especs are gradually released and are temporarily the rage of the season.
---
Oh and besides, there are classes that are obviously lacking in functionality compared to some others. This way they can be prioritized better. Thief and warrior, for example, are missing good support specs.
---
&gt; Don't they already have to do that though? That's what I don't get, how is this backlash any different from that backlash?
---
The difference is in the severity. Consider if a player, that's been happily playing firebrand for 3 months, hears the news that tomes will no longer be a thing and firebrands are getting paladin auras as their specialization mechanic instead. For whatever reason. Consider the backlash regarding that decision compared to backlashes regarding some traits being tuned down numerically. Again, we're not talking chronos here, that's a whole another can of worms.
---
I think you misread what I wrote in there .
---
I don't play this game anymore and have only returned after 2 years to see how its doing
---
Yeah, this sub when i played had HARDCORE shills. They would kiss the literal ground ANET walked on. The problem when you have a community that fanatically praises a company like that, is that its destined to always crash and burn, because the company takes advantage of them.
---
Kind of sad to see it happen though, I sure didn't want the game to go out like this, seems from what i've read about and seen recently the Devs have cut support and the content is being drip feed as they move on to another project and slowly pull the plug on guild wars 2. Kind of crazy, seeing the game so fresh in my mind but i could already see the direction this game was heading after realizing how little content this game has always offered and the year long draughts of nothing (like the year after HOT holy shit)
---
Anyway back to WOW classic lol
---
They aren't and they probably haven't even started, which is why they didn't bring them up.
---
Not half the population, but a very loud and annoying minority. My grandpa didn't fight in WWII for stupid republican kids to think white supremacy's cool nowadays. :/
---
Should we tell them?
---
You have to understand that if they gave it to you for 7 days extra, then everyone would want it too. Then someone with 14 days would say it's just 7 days from the date you got it.
---
They have to pick that a date and go with it.
---
hi,
---
if you play at server time 12pm onwards, you can transfer to nsp and raid with us slayers Xd  we're one of the few who kill your yb players.
---
=)
---
our guild policy is to kill as many enemies as we can in our raid.  if you like that attitude, you'll enjoy running with us.
---
we're nice too.  we dont do server politics or what not and we often joke about life and stuff.
---
They talked about how this saga's maps were going to be designed with HoT and PoF masteries in mind, and with them being bundled *and* required to play the new saga, it's possible the expansions are just going to be treated as "baseline" material before Living World sagas take over and carry things onward.
---
The lack of gear grind alone made gw2 different. For adults like myself who like hard content I didn't have to farm. I could play challenging raids they never get old or trivialized. Up to today we cleared 7 wings a week.
---
The problem is challenge. I love open world too, but I love challenges and they keep me engaged. I played open world when I was less busy and the group wasn't organized to occupy my time.
---
But if there's no challenge its not interesting as a game. A lot of people play mmos because the achievement gives them a reward. They are no longer developing content for those people and it will really hurt the game.
---
I truly want to know how the heck did you go from FFXIV's Blue Mage to somehow thinking GW2 can have a Koda character with its own level capped story content.
---
&gt;The contempt Anet *'s own community* has for ~~it‚Äôs own community~~ them is unforgiveable.
---
Corrected it for you. 
---
Seriously, contempting heavy insults and threats against their workers is absolutely correct. This sub went too far with their rages and now they have to deal with the sad fact that all the constructive criticism got drowned by rage and hate.
---
&gt; For the first time in its lifetime, the game is in danger
---
Yeah, no. Keep in mind that - even if they can yell very loud and their heavy insults are disgusting - everything you can read in this sub and in other forums, is only about 5% of the playerbase. It's not like this sub speaks for the whole playerbase, it's only a small minority (even though it's might look pretty much). They could drop all these raging idiots and it wouldn't impact the game much. So maybe the "game is in danger" for these few people, but hey, if they think about leaving, they should go, this way we could go back to peace and have a place for constructive criticism here (Just my opinion).
---
I've argued with my wife. I've gotten angry and yelled at my wife. I have probably at my most angry threatened to leave, which is what most people here are doing. Threatening to leave. People get angry and they raise their voice.  I think the threats, insults and hate are a relatively small percentage of the population. Mind you there has been quite a bit of hyperbole. But I don't know that it's not understandable. 
---
People seem to think all anger is a bad thing. Anger can be a useful tool if you don't go overboard. Anger can drive progress.  Maybe this kind of anger will get someone at Anet to talk notice.  
---
Of course there are people who go too far, but I don't think a lot of it is too far, even if it's further than I would go. We don't all have the same lines.
---
That's not the devs, that's the marketing team.
---
The fun part is that the GW community actually paid for this farse .
---
Since when did race = class?
---
I never said otherwise. But  you can't say hyperbolic posts aren't happening they're just getting removed and downvoted. There's a guy who posted just a short while ago, speaking about Anet's contempt for the community.  These things may get downvoted and removed, but before that I'm reading them, and so are other people.  I'm pretty sure for every upvoted reasonable post there's a removed negative post that's way over the top.
---
was thinking about doing this too, but gonna be hard to go from action like combat back to tab targeting
---
I played the medic class and was a main healer (shield healing) for raiding before I left.  The dungeons were pretty fun due to the attack telegraphing.  The raid bosses were memorable in that they weren't just tank'n'spank but had interesting mechanics.  One of the encounters had a floor that slowly disappeared, reducing the battle area.  Another raid boss, iirc, had 6 players completing a small obstacle course of lasers and stuff to debuff the boss.
---
The two things I enjoyed most about that game was the housing (customization) and gameplay mechanics (telegraphing attacks; double jumping; farming/mining by attacking nodes).
---
&gt;Giving those things to other people for less work makes the rewards less meaningful for the other raiders.
---
But what's the alternative? That they can *never* get those things without raiding? How does that benefit anyone? Yeah, raiders might feel that the rewards are less meaningful to them, but better that than that other people who would appreciate the rewards not be able to get them, right? Raiders should be grateful that they *have* the thing, rather than worrying that *other* people should *not* have the thing.
---
Exactly. There is no one method. If you complete the map while doing hearts, meats, events, etc, you will take less overall time and get less bored than just doing one thing like a heart with multiple characters.
---
&gt; I don't play Warframe, so sadly none of the words there told me anything. :(
---
Basically, when DE (company that makes warframe) has an update that's way too big to handle, they split it up and release it piecemeal bit by bit.
---
They had an update that would add a new gamemode, rework the entire starchart (game map) and progress the story campaign, but because it was shaping up to be too massive, they released the gamemode, the starchart rework, and the campaign progression in seperate mainline updates of their own.
---
Now, they want to release a new update that's going to rework/reshape the entire game world by uniting it with space combat/travel and again, since its shaping up to be too massive, they're gonna split it up, and release it piecemeal so they can manage it easier and better.
---
&gt;That's the thing. I'm sure actually scripting traits doesn't require much work. Most time investment comes from coming up with these ideas, testing and balancing them, and creating art assets for them. The first one is required in order to make any sort of actionable roadmap. The third one is not required for traits (only the trait icons), but it is required for skills and profession mechanics - something that needs to be released first anyway, so it's already a major initial investment. So we're only left with testing and balancing as things that can be partially neglected for the initial release and spread out over the course of the season. That's not a lot of savings, isn't it?
---
Wouldn't time saved on actually designing the additional traitlines and making assets for them (harbinger shroud for example) be noteworthy?
---
The assets may be minimal, but the actual balance and design time is precious. You get the core function and balance of a class, and you can save time on additional traits.
---
&gt;Now if especs were released one-by-one, then all the resources can be dedicated to fully developing 1 or 2 specs at a time. With developers moving onto further especs as the one they're currently working on is released. As a result, specs would get full attention and be able to be delivered in a manageable time, and even balancing them post-release would be easier because there wouldn't be 9 specs to balance right away, their number will gradually grow from 1 and upwards, but as the first ones will be in the game for longer, they'll see more balance patches and as such won't be in a critical need for balancing by the time 5th, 6th, 7th espec is released. The only downside is that, yes, players that main one class will have to wait, potentially quite a while. But my hope is that it would incentivize them to try out new classes as their especs are gradually released and are temporarily the rage of the season.
---
I would support this, if it wasn't for the fact that anet has demonstrated a complete and utter inability to have anything resembling a roadmap or a scedule.
---
For a company like bungie or digital extremes I'd have no issue with them taking this approach, but considering anet, too many players would be screwed over way too hard by this.
---
&gt;The difference is in the severity. Consider if a player, that's been happily playing firebrand for 3 months, hears the news that tomes will no longer be a thing and firebrands are getting paladin auras as their specialization mechanic instead. 
---
This doesn't make sense for several reasons.
---
1.)Uh what? No? All they would get is just an additional traitline while leaving the current ones intact.
---
2.) Why would they remove tomes and add auras after they already released and finallized the class?
---
Your reasoning here is incredibly confusing, why would they do this?
---
And second of all, what stops them from doing it now?
---
Your issue doesn't seem to be exclusive to this solution at all, and everything you say can be applied to elite specs in general.
---
Like Treize said , nothing to worry about if you're that new .
---
Same lol
---
Thorns didn't have much buildup. It was like 1 episode really.
---
It's not a question of rights, it's a question if just being absurd. I mean, getting outraged about the dev management on a game you don't play is silly at best.
---
The end result is still the same , this doesn't help .
---
This, but also i could have my last missing glowing eye skin...  ;D
---
Possibly, but if that's the case, then 1. they probably should have been more clear about their intention to deliver that, and 2. they really could have done that anyway, I mean they had current events and festivals running during the previous season, nothing about "season" was preventing them from having additional content running in parallel. 
---
I do *hope* that this will mean more "side story" content for the game, but they did a big stage show, and didn't use that big stage show as an opportunity to convey that message, so the big stage show was a waste.
---
The pve nerfs to chrono hit wvw chronos hard. Chrono doesnt really exist for wvw right now. Some groups might run one or two for the utility, but its use is niche
---
If you *are* gonna play chrono, ignore boon duration and focus on survivability
---
The assets may be minimal, but the actual balance and design time is precious. You get the core function and balance of a class down, and you can save time on additional traits to be released and balanced later.
---
Uh what? No? All they would get is just an additional traitline while leaving the current ones intact. Why would they remove tomes and add auras after they already released and finallized the class with the proposed system (piecemeal) but not with the current one (all at once)? That makes zero sense. 
---
ESPECIALLY considering they've literally done the same thing with our current system with chrono over and over and over again and nobody seems to care.
---
Your issue doesn't seem to be exclusive to this solution at all, and everything you say can be applied to elite specs in general, but for some reason you only think its a problem here? I don't get it why?
---
Like, according to you they shouldn't release elite specs at all, because what happens when they release an elite spec, decide they don't like it, then change it? In fact this has ALREADY happened with chrono again.
---
I 2nd planetside 2. I play it on the side when i get fps cravings.

Accidentally had a couple of ascended trinkets but here you go bud :)
---
We both clearly have a different idea of what is toxic and what is harmless or tame. I'm of the idea that comments like the ones I linked are completely uncalled for and only harmful. I mean, translate them to real life... If you mock someone's appearance in real life, that's bullying. Calling for someone to get fired is a serious allegation. And yet, on the internet it's okay?
---
I have also seen and dealt with much worse myself. I'm a hobbyist musician and I've had people absolutely tear apart my work in the just l most brutally honest fashion possible. I needed to grow some kind of thick skin to deal with that. But as you said... It was feedback. Feedback is useful. Once I learned how to take it when something I'd have poured hours of work and passion into get called "painfully amateur" or "terrible", I was able to put that feedback to good use and figure out how to improve.
---
I'm not really talking about that kind of feedback though. I'm talking about personal attacks and insults: comments that transcend the topic of the content/product they should be criticising and start to insult the maker instead. Like you, I've also dealt with far worse than the comments I've linked. Not quite death threats but certainly personal insults, slurs, and false accusations. I mean, I'd imagine anyone that played a competitive online game probably had to deal with a lot of that. But that doesn't make it okay.
---
I don't know about you but it frustrates me to no end that over the internet it is so commonplace to find disrespect and offence thrown out so casually. If you (speaking in general here) have the mental strength to identify that these comments are meaningless in the end and only possess malicious intent, then power to you. But not everyone has that luxury. And I can imagine that as a dev, having to deal with comments like the ones I linked and much much worse on such a regular basis is absolutely demotivating. The game industry is of course not the only industry that suffers from this, but with the prevalence of games as a service and games by nature being something that customers put a lot of emotional weight into, it's certainly one of the industries that suffers the most from entitlement, unreasonable customers, and toxicity.
---
I'm sure this is what Rubi was referring to with her tweets, not necessarily the fact that the community's response to the announcement was generally negative. The comments I linked may have been comparatively not as bad as other stuff out there (god knows what goes on in devs' mailboxes), but in the end they're still personal attacks that I personally wish weren't so normalised.
---
&gt; which is what most people here are doing. Threatening to leave. People get angry and they raise their voice. I think the threats, insults and hate are a relatively small percentage of the population.
---
You should read Rubi's tweets about it, it's not as small as you think.

Uh what? No? All they would get is just an additional traitline while leaving the current ones intact. Why would they remove tomes and add auras after they already released and finallized the class with the proposed system (piecemeal without all traitlines) but not with the current one (all at once)? That makes zero sense. 
---
ESPECIALLY considering they've literally done the same thing with our current system with chrono over and over and over again.
---
&gt;Again, we're not talking chronos here, that's a whole another can of worms.
---
The thing is, chrono is literally proof that your problem is not only NOT exclusive to my idea, but it has actually happened multiple times in the past with the current system.
---
I'm not a sad enough person to get outraged at the plotline of a book series I don't read. I hope you aren't either.
---
And about your intelligence comment. You don't seem to be sufficiently well-read to know of the Ad Hominem fallacy. To dumb it down - for you - you are attacking me instead of my argument, which means either you can't rebut my argument correctly or else you can't think without injecting your emotions.
---
Also, I have an engineering degree. It's hard to get one of those - not that I'd expect you to know anything about that. People who can get an engineering degree don't make the Ad Hominem fallacy.
---
Cheers.
---
I have yet to receive my mail. I had hot and pof since September 2018 :((
---
Pretty sure we'll find out what's going on there in Guild Wars 4
---
Can PvE mobs crit? I don't think I've ever seen one crit before, but I also don't stare at my combat log, so
---
Can anyone tell me how to load up ArcDps, mount radial menu, and some kind of visual enhancer (sweetfx, reshade)
---
Seems like each one of those uses a .dll and I can only chainload once.
---
I read Rubis tweet. You know what's absent from that tweet. A percentage of threats/overboard posts to actually negative posts. I'm not supporting threats. I'm not supporting people going overboard. I am absolutely supporting the right for people to be angry at perceived mistreatment. To many people, they feel like Anet has been mistreating them.  Whether that's valid or not is just a matter of opinion. Their opinion isn't any better than mine.
---
I believe the threats are wrong. I also believe they're a tiny percentage of the feedback.
---
And who told them to do what they did? Jesus?
---
Especially considering they've literally done the same thing with our current system with chrono over and over and over again.
---
Like, according to you they shouldn't release elite specs at all, because what happens when they release an elite spec, decide they don't like it, then change it? In fact this has already happened with chrono again.
---
Again, I don't why "What if they change their mind?" is only applicable to releasing classes traitline by traitline, but not applicable to the current system when it has literally happened with the current system too many times to count.
---
The thing is, chrono is literally proof that your problem is not only not exclusive to my idea, but it has actually happened multiple times in the past with the current system.
---
You haven't even explained why my idea makes the problem worse, you just keep saying "What if they change their mind". Well what if they change their mind now? 
---
If anything my idea makes the problem smaller, because if they change their mind for something, they can fix it before release since they don't have to release the entire class at once.
---
&gt;I'm not a sad enough person to get outraged at the plotline of a book series I don't read
---
First sentence, already a strawman argument. 
---
Nice fail and even trying to lie by using the tired old "i got an engineering degree!!" lie to try to keep the high ground, even bigger fail.
---
I also got two, and I was missing exactly two of the skins from the box. I mean, there was a reason I never bought them in the first place, but at least they won't be part of future Guaranteed Wardrobe/Armor Unlocks
---
When I heard the waves I thought this was going to be a GW2 themed crab rave
---
Upper Management and stakeholders usually.
---
&gt; The team, though, has been through the layoffs. They've seen the internal side of things and known just how bad things may have really looked. There's a good reason to think that they made the season 4 finale with the expectation that might be the last thing produced for the game. 
---
Maybe. 
---
Maybe.
---
I didn't read the layoffs *that* pessimistically. They've never been public about the full details surrounding them, but my impression of them was that there were several "secret projects" going on within ANet that had nothing to do with the core GW2 experience, and that the layoffs *primarily* hit those projects. We've also heard rumors that in the aftermath, the actual GW2 team might even be *larger* than it was before, so my perception going into this was not pessimistic. 
---
Even if that were the case, however, they promised a season 5 coming like six months ago, players had every reason to expect that season 5 would be at least equivalent to season 4, so if they expected *community* expectations to be lower than that, then they would have needed to let the community know that this was in jeopardy months ago. If your theory is correct, then ANet's culture of secrecy bit them in the ass on that one. 
---
But *even* so, there is still no excuse for so massive a disconnect. Ever. The developers do not live in a vacuum. The forums exist. The subreddit exists. Youtube exists. We know that at least some devs actually play the game, you can see their tags. *Some* devs might keep their heads down and have no idea what the community is thinking, but that *cannot* be true for all of them. The ones who knew should have spread the word, because anyone even vaguely engaged with the community would be aware of our basic expectations. 
---
At the very least, they should have reached out to some of their casual partners and given them a heads up. The content creators and whatnot that are outside the company but can be trusted with some secrets. Give them a basic outline of the announcements and gauge their responses as members of the community. 
---
There is no valid excuse for the tone deafness of this presentation. It's not everyone's fault, but it's definitely *someone's* fault.
---
The hooplah wasn't for us. It was for drawing new eyes to the game. PAX presentations get a lot of attention.
---
It was still a total cringefest, but most convention showcases are.
---
I've seen more french guilds than AG or Blacktide too so far this week, especially Blacktide who were linked to Deso, who I've only seen RT from when we were linked, who will most likely move soon.
---
For now you seem to be in the completely wrong Tier and players and Guilds are already transferring off to their preferred servers, just like every other relink.
---
This is great advice, thanks! Do you remember if the hearts are guaranteed to reward them? Just asking because I did a heart test in Thunderhead Peaks earlier this evening and didn't get any Branded Mass, though I did get some from mining and Dwarven Chests in the map.
---
I feel the comments you listed are heard in real life all the time and do not constitute bullying. 
---
Perhaps one difference between us is that I think mockery serves a social purpose. It can be done too much and too easily, but mockery and even name calling serve social purposes that keep society maintained. 
---
TBH, everyone behaves as though what I said is true. They just disagree on what mockery and name calling is allowed. I think most don't recognize its social purpose and that's why they get caught up in moralizing/policing the behavior rather than seeing it as societal health control. (And if we try to entirely remove it then we will rescind into violence, since the mockery and name calling is a social tactic we've developed to replace the previous physical tactic.)
---
Because there are players that are private messaging her and harassing her about it as if she's responsible for it , shes a mother &amp; i dont think she finds joy in drama. 
---
Yes she choose to reply after the announcement because they privately messaged her about it.
---
Brief timeline of Living World:
---
Season 1: regular content drops every 2 weeks or so. Anet got shouted at because it was not permanent content
---
Season 2: the Dry Top/Silverwastes approach -- expand on a map. Anet got shouted at for only having 3 new maps in a years old game
---
Season 3-4: a wide ranging season with a map each episode -- Anet gets shouted at for "working on story" "3 hours of content every 3 months" etc
---
If it seems like Devs are playing the victim, maybe it's because the internet outrage echo chamber can get really mean. Not just dickhead individuals, but the amplifier effect of a bunch of passionate people talking to each other can make even decently constructive folk be really awful.
---
The announcement was a clear roadmap into uncharted territory, and I had no problems with it -- probably because I turned it off as I heard "let's hear from the VP of Marketing", ad men never say anything worth hearing.
---
Thank you!
---
I barely remember what Ashes of Creation is let alone any controversy about it.
---
Will do thanks!
---
I have an issue, I run teh installer select the defaults options, then install but the files dll don't appear in my bin64 folder. are a way to install this manually?.
---
Thanks
---
&gt;  I also believe they're a tiny percentage of the feedback
---
In persons probably, yes. But it's the same as it is on Youtube, Facebook etc. These people are the loudest, even if they are only a few.
---
How about a game you *used* to play but still feel strongly about? Hm? Thought about that?
---
Nope, don't think so.
---
Complaints and feedback keep games alive. People like you who make post like this fail to understand something so logical and obvious, its unfortunate. 
---
Anet NEEDS us to be vocal about how we feel. A game like gw2 cant survive without feedback from the community. 
---
If we shut up, we might as well just praise them for literally everything they do and accept our fate as passive and enduring customers. We would be contributing to our own dissatisfaction.  Our own unhappiness. 
---
You do see how thats silly right?
---
The bird in the trailer looks to be either a Gyrfalcon or a Broad Winged Hawk or a weird mix of both together. Please keep in mind both species have different coloring that are dependent on region, season and maturity of the raptor so there will obviously be a wide variation of colors when those species are Googled.
---
It is definitely not an owl because first and foremost, the eyes are in the wrong position on the head, the wings are the wrong shape and the beak is also the wrong shape. Secondly, most owls are nocturnal while most raptors are diurnal. This video is taking place during daylight.
---
It is not a raven because it is not black and is completely the wrong shape and size and everything. Calling the bird in the trailer a raven would be akin to saying a horse looks like a snake. 
---
It isn‚Äôt a red tailed hawk or red shouldered hawk as there is no red on the tail or shoulders. 
---
It‚Äôs not a golden eagle because golden eagles are completely brown and even the juveniles who have patchy white spots do not have bands on their chest or tails and the bird in the trailer does. 
---
The bird isn‚Äôt a peregrine falcon because peregrine falcons have a distinctive white chin with what I like to refer to as grey/brown ‚Äúmutton chops‚Äù on the sides of their white chin. Our birdy boi has an all brown head. No white chin.
---
I‚Äôm leaning more towards Broad Winged Hawk because they both have dark brown feathers on the top of the wings, barred chests, barred tails, yellow and black on the beak, same head shape, brown head, and lighter white/tan chest.
---
Rythlock and who ?
---
You're joking right .
---
Server re-pops are done around Monday evening server time (afternoon eastern NA time). For a full server to go to very high a massive population shft usually has to happen, guilds quitting / moving off server, so you could be waiting some time if you're trying to move to a very healthy server.
---
I think that they know that better than anyone. If they had that ammunition, they would have announced it and avoided this PR disaster. 
---
I agree they should just fuckin tell us already, rather than force people to slowly realize on their own, but it is what it is.
---
&gt;So, because you said so. You see, you don't have any actual data or established facts here, just your own personal theory, alongside a convenient dismissal of my arguments as a "delusional conspiracy theory". 
---
Am I to take this statement as an admission by you that you actually believe that ArenaNet are neglecting the relevant modes out of nothing more than pure arbitrary malice then? Because otherwise that statement does not apply.
---
&gt;I think I see what the issue is now. It seems like you're trying to look at this through the lens of 'casuals make up most of the game -&gt; Anet caters to them and makes the most money -&gt; everyone else is irrelevant'.
---
Pretty much, except that it's not a matter of "looking at it through a lens", but merely that that is the reality of the situation.
---
&gt;So, a complete zero-sum game where casuals win and every other group of players/game mode has to lose completely.
---
"Has"? Give the persecution complex a rest please.
---
&gt;This is clearly not how it has to work, because, as you might know, GW2 has had various communities flourish and stay alive over the years, despite the game arguably always having a mostly PvE focus, first and foremost. 
---
Except it is. If PvE is what keeps the lights on, then that is what they're going to invest their time/resources into. And if PvE requires most of those resources, then it will come at the detriment to the other modes.
---
If industry scuttlebutt is to be believed with regards to the resources being allocated to GW2 overall, that is precisely what *has* been going on at ArenaNet.
---
&gt;There has always been an influx of both new and returning players whenever Anet brings out a new change, like gliding/Warclaw, or a new raid wing. The change in population and engagement is palpable every time. Yet quite often, these changes are either lacking in something (e.g. W7's relative ease), or not what was needed, so players gradually start leaving again. This is not necessarily because Anet doesn't care. In your first post, you said "we're currently not prioritising new content for you because there simply isn't enough of you for it to be worthwhile for us to bother", to which someone responded that this is an issue of the snake biting it's own tail. The metaphor is very much apt, because the decline of game modes Anet previously put a lot of effort into is precisely largely due to mismanagement. GW2Efficiency shows that, out of 214,885 accounts registered there, Wing 1 has a 30-20% completion rate. By W6 and 7, we're somewhere around 5%. Did the raiding community just spontaneously start haemorrhaging players, or did Anet make some bad decisions in regards to raiding, rewards and balance? Hmmmmm
---
This is lovely padding and all, but it's completely irrelevant to the crux of the matter.
---
&gt;I'm still not entirely sure why you think raiding/WvW are irrelevant to this game, or why you think a game company has to focus on one game mode and everything else can go to shit. It's obviously not the case, but sometimes you just can't reach an agreement with people. Have a good night :)
---
I'm still not entirely sure what you think you're going to achieve by lying to yourself by trying to frame this as "what he thinks", instead of it being *how things are*. Bury your head in the sand if you will, but ArenaNet's actions (or lack of) is what ultimately matters, and clearly they aren't particularly bothered about those shrinking demographics you yourself have noted.

Maybe you might get lucky and the "New ArenaNet" might now have enough staff allocated to GW2 in order to give these modes more than a single employee and/or cut'n'paste jobs in the future. But that isn't going to change the fact that Casual PvE is going to continue to take priority over everything else, to exclusion if needs must.
---
Up to you if you want to continue believing that ArenaNet is going to change, but the picture you paint doesn't seem to be one of optimism, no?
---
Oh there's plenty of controversy around it right from the time it had a kickstarter. I know r/mmorpg can be toxic but most threads about AoC are on the money.
---
Speaking for PvE, yes they are completely viable. It's mostly a matter of preference. The runes of the pack have some nice advantages : they give might and fury, more offensive stats and don't give you toughness. But the main downside is it gives you less boon duration than leadership. The only thing you should really care when you build Chrono is to have enough boon duration to maintain perma boons (personally I aim to get 100% in fractals).
---
And labeling toxicity, hate, threats and insults as "constructive criticism", confirmed with a meme is the correct way, right? Have you even read this sub for the last two days?
---
Aha
---
I dont think WoW is doing fine and all available metrics indicate it isnt but its whatever.
---
Sorry because of time zone difference, may I know the day and time for UTC or UTC+8 would be great üòÇ much appreciated

&gt;The pve nerfs to chrono hit wvw chronos hard.

That shouldn't even be a sentence to begin with. Separation of balance between modes should be basic.

Regarding your whole second paragraph do you have any resources to explore that side of the argument? I'm pretty much of the opinion that the new definition of racism is just libs thinking prescriptivism is hot shit again but I would be interested in at least learning where they're coming from.

Gaming company responds to negative feedback by looking into the issue instead of just blaming players for toxicity.

WoW isn't the MMO you compare stuff to though. WoW is it's own animal and always has been. By WOW standards all MMos would be considered failures. It's like comparing all soft drinks to Coke.

Buy PoF right now and you'll get HoT completely free.

Actually, using your own analogy, at the time that would be a sensible choice. I have X money. That money can buy me a house to live in, but I‚Äôll only be able to afford a used car. Alternatively I can purchase a Ferrari and I‚Äôll have to keep renting an apartment.
---
Just because two things aren‚Äôt directly connected by their root category (car vs house) doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt connected by a sub category (things which have to fit my budget).
---
To be fair, a lot of the post are toxic. They may touch on the important topics but a lot are borderline tantrums. Which makes it more difficult for constructive criticism shine through.

I have seen good discussions on both sides, and I've seen inflamatory trolls on both sides too. You're implying flame is only on one side, which is false.

Sorry if it sounds cynical, but do you really think that any troll will change their view with this post? They don't even read more than 3 sentences usually.

Also you suggesting that the Dev team could take only trolls in account for their workflow? If true, they're not serious about their job, and I sincerely think they're not that stupid.

&gt; shes a mother &amp; i dont think she finds joy in drama. 
---
Given how close this was to the explosion from the glorified wet fart that was the event put out by ANet, I have my doubts this is unrelated to it at all.
---
&gt;Yes she choose to reply after the announcement because they privately messaged her about it.
---
I can't believe this because there's no real evidence for it.  Anyone can claim someone sent them something when nothing was sent at all. If it did happen, all I can say is report, block, and move on.  Mentioning the abuse online isn't going to make it go away.  Less savory people will see that as someone who's easy to rile up and give their try at sending their own vitriolic messages.
---
its healthy that people care about the game. :/ dont stop feedback.  its on anets part on how they should respond.  they're a company, hell, i have companies.  dont they have training on how to talk to clients?
---
you will always have a disgruntled guy, but you must treat them well because they give you cash.
---
i myself said shut up take my money to all anet future stuff, but i still feel shit when it comes to their customer and player support.
---
in the official forums for example, they would suspend you for voicing out.  emotionally, i know my workers who play this game will see that, and i dont know how 100s of them would react.  i could tell them, lets play wow instead, but, i dont.
---
as an owner, i know some management or personel is shit.  but, they elude the radar.  thats just how things are.
---
i love the game.  i dont care about the expansion etc. i like homiostasis.  so, i continue to support.  but, not everyone is like me.
---
if i could, if i owned anet, id fire their customer relations and change with new blood thats trained eq wise. but i dont own it. :/ bleh
---
I haven't seen people complaining about strikes .
---
Afk have a free sip with rewards on top of it activity ? 
---
People love this stuff .
---
It doesn't matter whether the firing was deserved or not (although it was not).  The fact it came as a mob demand meant it was going to have a chilling affect on all the other developers regardless.  The community had two choices: a world where JP still worked for Arenanet and devs continued to speak directly to fans, or a world where JP was fired and devs don't speak directly to fans.
---
The community chose the second option.  Now they have to live with it, whether they like it or not.  And if they don't like it, well, "once the avalanche has started it's too late for the pebbles to vote".
---
what is the difference between story mode and explore mode for dungeons? and how do you choose wings? did Ascalon Catacombs and it said I completed 2/4 wing or something
---
Ive been trying the free version of gw2 and I'm considering buying the expansions but I'm wondering how important are the living world seasons? The whole package is a bit expensive and I'm not actually sure what kind of content i would be buying into, therefore it's hard to assess wether it's worth the price.
---
Is it a pack of story missions like the ones i've been getting every ten levels? How long are these episodes? What type of content should I expect to find? Would I be missing out on anything important if I were to not get these rewards?
---
What game is this?
---
You need to go back to sleep man
---
Yes I should probably walk out of my job right now since we are all entitled to holidays, I'll be sure to tell my patients that StarWistStuff said it's fine.
---
&gt; I've been assuming ArenaNet just don't know what they're doing anymore. No ones actually in charge, and everything can change at a moments notice. Yes it's miraculous any content get's developed to the quality levels they produce,
---
I mean I can't believe I have to say this, but these are insults. These are not polite, respectful or constructive comments. This is toxicity.
---
If your partner bombarded you with comments like that, it would be emotional abuse. It wouldn't be the same as physical abuse, but it's still abuse, it's still destructive and it's still not OK.
---
It's fine to be disappointed in the announcement, it's fine to politetly express a desire for specific information which wasn't announced (ie: I would like to know if/when there will be more elite specs/expansions/fractals/raids for GW2) but calling it a miracle that their workers produce quality content or that they don't know how to do their jobs (and being part of a mob saying the same or worse), that's crossing a line. It's not the worst thing you can say but that doesn't make it OK.
---
&gt; Honest advice to Anet, grow up. 
---
I find this comment ironic.
---
&gt; Stop acting like you've never read a message board before, we've all seen deplorable shit on the internet before. Ignore it like an adult and move on. Because your a game development company, your not a person, you don't have feelings to hurt as much as you like to think you do, that's just you.
---
I find this comment disgusting. ArenaNet might not be a person, but every employee working there is. It should be minimum required behavior that you could treat them with the respect another human deserves.
---
Please be true.. omg.. So may backpacks I want to try, but they just don't match anything else I have on..
---
This comment is a prime example of what I was talking about. I guess, thank you for providing me that.
---
Mirror comp (2 druids 2 chronos) has become less common in pugs, in favor of 1 druid and 1 off healer like an ele or heal scourge, so it's usually better to run pack runes, because otherwise the non-druid subgroup can have trouble keeping up fury.
---
In fractals? Go nuts, but chrono isn't ideal in fractals anymore, even for pugs. Most have switched over to firebrand renegade.
---
Spitting in soup is an act of malice. No-one at ArenaNet is intentionally making the game worse or "spitting in it" to piss you off.

I don't care what issue you have with a restaurant, bank or other company - don't abuse people. Being unhappy with service, being wronged by service, being anything - don't abuse people.
---
Anet Developers are the biggest Snow Flakes in the entire industry.
---
1. If you do a bad job you will be told you did a bad job. If you spent a REALLY long time creating a bad job then your competency should be questioned
---
2. If you continually take all criticism is toxic you need to deal with that on your therapist's couch because you are the problem NOT the customers. Toughen up FFS
---
3. If you want all the "toxicity" to stop start listening to the player base for once in your life. Customers know what they want and it's a insult to continue on with the "players are too stupid" mentality that runs rampant at Anet.
---
Start by following 3 simple steps. You'd be amazed how fast that "toxicity" disappears. Also if the CEO of Anet reads this you can go ahead and shoot me a PM with a job offer to toughen up your staff. You might have to spend a chunk of change on crying closets but I'll turn your game around in no time.
---

---
Aw who's a little baby Charr cub. You are. *You are.*
---
Tbf are there any people still left from that group?
---
I'm pretty sure ANet knows who the major content makers are because they are partnered with ANet, and reimbursed financially through that partnership.
---
If you're ever looking for people to play with hot me up. Our guild is small, but pretty active and we have a discord as well.
---
&gt; Why would they remove tomes and add auras after they already released and finallized the class with the proposed system (piecemeal without all traitlines) but not with the current one (all at once)?
---
Because, hypothetically, for whatever reason it ended up not working for them. They managed to create one traitline for tomes, but couldn't pull off 6 more traits to provide meaningful choice or satisfy that power fantasy. This is a mere example. If this happened in a world where they hadn't released the first part of the espec, then they could just scrap tomes and design the specialization anew, and nobody would have known about this. But in a world where the spec was already released, that means annoyed players and more bashing on social media about their incompetence.
---
In game development this hypothetical situation happen way more often that you think. Ideas not always work out as planned. They need to be iterated upon, and often even scrapped. And you don't get to see everything that was scrapped during the game's development, you only see the end product, the "ideas that could", so to say.
---
&gt; Your issue doesn't seem to be exclusive to this solution at all, and everything you say can be applied to elite specs in general, but for some reason you only think its a problem here? I don't get it why?
---
I don't know what issue are you talking about, we're just juggling ideas here. I'm trying to show you likely flaws in your proposed approach.
---
&gt; and everything you say can be applied to elite specs in general
---
Yes. The difference is in that with one approach the playerbase doesn't get to know about all these failed attempts at designing an espec and only gets a final polished product, while with the other - it does, and that creates repercussions and may tie developers' hands.
---
&gt; Like, according to you they shouldn't release elite specs at all, because what happens when they release an elite spec, decide they don't like it, then change it? In fact this has already happened with chrono again.
---
It happened. And nobody was happy about it. Every time it caused a backlash. Imagine the same, but potentially up to 18 times (9 specs * 2 times they would need to be updated with new traitlines) over the course of one season.
---
&gt; Again, I don't why "What if they change their mind?" is only applicable to releasing classes traitline by traitline, but not applicable to the current system when it has literally happened with the current system too many times to count.
---
Mhm, no. I can only remember 2 specs which design was changed drastically after release: chrono (albeit multiple times, again, HUGE OUTLIER) and berserker (recently). Maybe also scrapper, with their gyros never working quite well enough due to technical issues.
---
&gt; The thing is, chrono is literally proof that your problem is not only not exclusive to my idea, but it has actually happened multiple times in the past with the current system.
---
Chrono is an outlier. They piled too much utility onto a class that was already bursting with utility. Chrono is a swiss knife of GW2, you can find a place for a chrono in any content. They didn't realize it back during HoT development just how OP would chronos end up being and how ubiquitous will they become in any and all PvE content. They should've been scaled back a long time ago, but ANet didn't have the guts to do it only until the last year.
---
&gt; You haven't even explained why my idea makes the problem worse, you just keep saying "What if they change their mind". Well what if they change their mind now?
---
I said everything I wanted to say multiple times how. There's only so many ways I can rephrase the same statements. I can't add anything else to them, if you didn't understand my points until now, then there's nothing I can do beyond suggesting you read them again. Or maybe I'm explaining myself poorly, I wouldn't know that.
---
You're part of the problem.
---
Auto correct is a bitch sometimes.

It's possible anti virus or anti malware has it locked and preventing it being install.  Check your  products quarantine or scan logs to see if its the cause
---
It's possible anti virus or anti malware has it locked and preventing it being install.  Check your  products quarantine or scan logs to see if its the cause.
---
Maybe if the people who are creating the toxic environment (to clarify - the barbarians who seem to think that sending hate mail and death threats to game developers in this, the year of our Lord 20-fucking-19 is for some reason an *okay thing to do*) would stop being idiots, people like Rubi would have the time and emotional energy to address legitimate complaints.
---
But when you've got a death threat in front of you, reasonable criticism just doesn't register. Or if it does, it registers as just another attack. Because that's what happens if people keep attacking you - even the most well-meant, mildest criticism starts looking like an attack.
---
And get Gw2 is dying and FFXIV is growing. Odd how that is, yeah?
---
I feel the Devs should still respond to feedback that is obviously positive.  It isn't often that they do, but when you see this torrent of disapproval I can't help but to put myself in their shoes.  As an individual, and if responding to feedback was based on my free will alone, I would probably shy away from responding to anything, either.
---
No one's to say that it could be the company policy or upper management keeping them from responding though.  If that is indeed true, well, hopefully we can see that change.  However, the responses here lately definitely would not convince that decision to change in my opinion.
---
GGG is pretty great.
---
At first I thought you were talking about the hand lotion. Then I saw the cat. I feel silly.
---
Got it, thank you! Is there any other meta class using leadership runes in either game mode? I have one of everything, I just don't want the runes to go to waste.
---
I'd crop out the personal info if I were you.
---
Some sell 5 in stacks of ones so you have to click a bunch of times. Also you can buy some for volatile magic each day in dragons stand (other than mistborn motes)
---
Welp, you don't get scrappers flying into your half captured camp on their mount once they see swords, living forever so you can't cap until 5 of their team mates arrive and start killing you? To be honest it isn't that bad, but it is frustrating. Being unable to catch people on mounts, no CC bar on mounts. Eugh.
---
However, nowhere near as bad as when you could cap/contest whilst on a mount big lol.
---
[Cultural Weapons](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cultural_weapon
---
) are relatively cheap Rare lvl 40 weapons, and most are easy to reach.
---
The Charr or Lionguard sets are good for Condition Damage weapons (like Scepter) while the Pirate or Ebon Vanguard sets are good for Power weapons (like Axe).
---
Those last 3 sets (Lion, Pirate, Ebon) also have unique skins you can't get anywhere else.
---
Oh yes, they do crit. Sometimes in T4 fractals it's a rarity to see that a mob DIDN'T crit you.
---
Throughout history there have, and always will be a small minority of bad actors. Nothing you say or do will ever change that and trying to simply gives them what they want, acknowledgement and attention. If you're on the internet and especially part of a public company you have to be prepared for the fact you're going to sometimes get some nasty shit. You can't change that. All you can do is ignore it and address the things that aren't that. 
---
If the only way everyone else, the majority, is going to get communication and answers is if the small bad apple minority stops being assholes then we're all screwed. So that's not an okay answer.
---
which is why we wanted xpacs, as seasons are just buffer content inbetween real content.
---
If I was an employer responsible for the well-being of my employees while they are at work, the last place I would tell them to go would be a community like this.
---
I wouldn't outright ban them, but they wouldn't be doing it during work hours and I certainly wouldn't be asking them to do it. This sub has reached a fever pitch of negativity and it's not coming down. It's a health hazard for employees now.
---
"Making a situation worse doesn't make it better" is the truth of the last few days.
---
Okay, that's great to know. I was worried about having to purchase an expensive stack of runes after putting all that work into getting leadership. I don't play Chrono often anymore since discovering axe mirage, but it would be nice to pick her up again. Are chronos still hilariously survivable? Because I distinctly recall swapping to a Chrono in the middle of a fractal (this is before the changes to Inspiration) and it really changed everything for the group.
---
It would be smart to follow the podcasts at least, those are a good barometer for the communities mood, happy community equals money spent.
---
Do you already have forgotten Scarlet? Season 1,2 were build up for HoT.
---
it pretty much is a crisis, since it implies gw2 is on maintenance mode.

&gt;**Context:**  then immediatley painting themselves red and claiming "white  knighting!," "shoe licker!," or any other inflammatory remark, purely  aimed at getting under their skin, then attacking them further after  they pipe up.

Not sure how your addition adds context or explains why it's ok to make broad generalizations while hating on others for doing so

You're right. Companies aren't people. Developers are. And they work for companies. Maybe I'm just old fashioned (or just old lol), but I'm personally not comfortable talking to people the way a lot of people seem to be online, because I don't draw a distinction between how I talk here, or in real life. I don't treat ANYONE like that, even when I'm angry. That's the issue. 
---
It's one thing to say I'm angry, I'm not happy, I'm going to leave the game. It's another thing to call people lazy or call for people to be fired, when you aren't working for the company and you have no idea who's actually responsible for any given situation. It's not any fan's call to do that.  Except maybe a situation like JP where we new exactly who was responsible. 
---
The bottom line is, I've seen a lot of very good posts that reflect disappointment and anger that aren't over the top and I've seen a lot of posts that I'm personally uncomfortable with because people don't deserve abuse, particularly if you're mad at the company. There is a line and that line is different for everyone. Again this could just be age speaking but it's certainly not how I was raised.
---
if you were playing alts, or spreading elder influence, beforehand, the dailies would spawn on map tiers close to what you were running, so you could easily get a t2 Alva even though the rest of your temple is t15, which could start lowering its level, and this is generally the case with all master missions (low level Zana isnt so useful etc.)
---
Because this is what you're doing:
---
&gt; manipulative word-twisting and confrontation.
---
Listen sonny my eyes are not so good so I can't tell which clouds I'm yelling at!
---
I did not word twist and your entire post is word twisting the community and confrontational to the community...
---
I think they can revamp weapon skills for certain classes and weapons  like they did for guardians‚Äô staff. A lot of people avoid playing druids or rangers because the base weapons are uninteresting. I feel like the same thing applies to base necro, but they have their elite spec‚Äôs mechanics to make it more fun. Changing some of these skills to make them more fun and interesting would definitely make the game feel new and exciting.
---
I'm just not sure how this contradicts what I was complaining about to the initial person I was talking to.  I said making hard statements like "They broke the pattern" when the pattern only existed for 1 living story into 1 expansion is ridiculous.  It's perfectly normal to be *concerned* especially if you aren't sure about the changes yet and they're being tight-lipped about the meat and potatoes of what a 'sage' includes... but using purposeful statements to make it seem like they said there's no new expansions coming ever again is spreading misinformation.
---
https://i.imgur.com/s3Cn3v1.jpg

Took advantage of that deal.
---
Another reason for Pact instead of Leadership is the "new" stat combo of Diviners: Power, Conc, prec, ferc. So basically there is now a Zerker gears that also has Conc as a main. With the extra Conc. from stats "boon duration" from Runes can be tweaked more depending on how you mix and what Duration you are happy with yourself/group.
---
Can you please tell me how I'm using a broad-stroked brush on something in this post in an offensive way?  I'm specifically referring to people who only reply to users to beat down on them, much like your original comment here.  I don't understand your response to this unless you felt as if I was personally targeting you?
---
They actually used to communicate a whole lot more.  After the PoF leaks the studio went into lockdown and stopped sharing much of anything about future plans, and still haven't recovered.
---
And yet here you are, on the GW2 sub 7 years after release ü§î

Im totalny agree with this post i play at underworld server we are linked now with abbadons mounth wich is German server... 90% of UW dont know German language.
---
It will be hardest 2 months relink...
---
That's not a very helpful criticism.
---
It may be the case that much of the positive feedback isn't productive.  
---
Threads like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxtf9r/the_rytlock_and_bangar_teaser/) are a good example of support and positive feedback in a friendly environment.  
---
But when a thread is posted about a negative topic such as being disappointed by the recent announcement, or ANet current and former staff expressing their complaints, it calls for a higher level of discussion. You have to make your case, with points and counter-points advancing the discussion.  
---
The issue for most positive feedback is that they are emotionally defensive, trying to support the game and developers rather than addressing points of the discussion.
---
While you are on the right path there, companies are what the management and shareholder make them. And those are people. 
---
Now, that being said, while attacking either a company OR the people that work there on a personal level is an absolute no-go, what Ive seen in this subreddit - and the forum and on twitter - is whiteknights taking legitimate - and often constructive - criticism and calling it slander or personal attacks.
---
Also, yes, the expression of said criticism often isnt done in an unemotional, detached way and therefore can be read as being personal attacks. But here Arenanet has to be the bigger "person", read those posts for what they really are and then start adressing criticism in a businesslike manner to stop the downward spiral of anger.
---
It is really important as a consumer in this day and age to ‚Äúvote with your reporting statistics‚Äù. Tech companies are very process driven.  Decisions are heavily based on reporting statistics which can be a combination of things like consumer activity and consumer purchases.  
---
If you‚Äôre really unhappy with the game and you‚Äôre logging into the game every day as well as buying gems, you‚Äôre actually providing ‚Äúpositive statistics‚Äù towards the ‚Äúmaintaining the status‚Äù.  It probably doesn‚Äôt matter how many well written posts you have made on social media, ANet‚Äôs not going to listening to that.  
---
If you want change then the best (and probably the most polite way) to do this is to contribute towards negative reporting statistics.  Don‚Äôt log in, don‚Äôt buy gems, and don‚Äôt post on the official forums.  It is only when the company sees the drop in player activity and revenue, will they try and do things differently to ‚Äúwin the players back‚Äù.  
---
Generally ‚Äúwin the players back‚Äù is usually something like a relaunching the game in a new direction.  In SWTOR it was the KOTFE expansion, in LOTRO it was the Riders of Rohan expansion and in WoW it was the Legion expansion.  There‚Äôs also the Realm Reborn content in FFXIV which is probably the most famous relaunch of all.  
---
I suspect the new ‚ÄúLiving World Saga‚Äù announcement was ANet‚Äôs clumsy way of trying to relaunch the game.  Unfortunately it‚Äôs going to something more concrete to ‚Äúwin the players back‚Äù.  To successfully relaunch an aging MMO, you really need to play your ‚Äúget out of jail card‚Äù (e.g. Artefact Weapons in WoW).

Yeah I've levelled every job to 70+ and most of them only start coming together by 60, some closer to 70. They really need to fix how piecemeal the kits feel pre-50/60.

and what has that to do with the argument that they "massively" promoted the announcement in advance??? 
---
exatcly. nothing.
---
do *you* even read before you post?
---
(and 1/6 is not 25% btw)
---
well you always define the job.
---
i.e. i tell you your job is to concentrate on all things related to stability.  i give you material to research, and you play the game to experiment and experience it first hand.  then you can tell me about it.
---
i tell you, if you dont know, its ok to ask.  or to a client, i'll do more research etc.
---
i give people freedom to solve things after i teach them.  i pay them to be creative and independent.
---
i mean if i have to decide for them, then id just do the task.
---
i find giving people a definite concentratio x working knowledge helps.

It's definitely low quality but it isn't so bad that it's trash.  Comments like those are usually by people on their phone and get tired of the really negative remarks.  All it essentially means is "Calm down, be happy for what you have," which in reality is the truth at this stage.
---
I can only see someone downvoting something like that because they don't want to be told what to do or how to feel--which in my opinion is worse overall than the comment itself.
---
But what do you do.
---
frankly I don't get in arguments about this often enough to have that sort of thing on hand but a quick google turned this up. 
---
https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/matthewclair/files/clair_denis_2015.pdf
---
There isn't really a primer for learning about this but this isn't a terrible article and it summarizes the main points succinctly enough.
---
&gt;  because the only thing that they have replied to is the 1% minority cherry picking the worse comments
---
ah, I see. now we have another dumb slogan for dumb ppl to use to kill every valid argument.
---
They function the same way armor does, and that has always been dyable
---
The risk of drivebay attacks behind NAT in minimal to nonexistent.
---
They absolutely have another expansion in the works but it's probably at least a year away. Expansions bring in huge profits and huge amounts of players to whom you can sell microtransactions as well. They'd be absolutely crazy to not have one planned, and there's pretty much zero chance NCSoft would allow "no more expansions" to fly.
---
Path of Exile?!! WTF! That's like comparing the most beautiful unicorn against a donkey with a plunge stuck to its head. Do a fair fight.
---
and thats why the internet goes to the shitter. nobody stands up against those morons and show some backbone anymore.
---
"I dont care", "its normal here", "it does not concern me", etc.
---
thats why we have trump, brexit, erdogan, boris johnsen, the brazilian guy and more.
---
Some sleeping pills would help, I became Immune to all of mine...
---
What about open world? Whenever I check to see what chunked my health, it's always a large non-crit.
---
She didn't address you/us but PMs she got that said "I hope you get cancer". Those are ofc not ok. But making a post about it doesn't change the pms, instead normal ppl feel adressed.
---
So the basis of my post is now mirroring suppression of individuality, freedom, and will lead to genocide.
---
I've officially heard everything.
---
I think the key difference in this case is the fact that Rubi isn‚Äôt calling players ‚Äúrando asshats‚Äù
---
She certainly isn‚Äôt shielded from repricussions if she were to start saying objectively bad things.
---
Surprise cannibalism.
---
On a serious note ggg is amazing. They were long time diablo players during the golden age of diablo 1 and 2. Their vision to basically take old school diablo,overhaul into a completely new game was genius especially after diablo 3 which didnt measure up to older releases.
---
One could say the devs are as much passionate if not more than the players, they are a very small studio but they love their game to the death which makes up for it.
---
Pointless .
---
Cheers for the builds! This will keep me going for some quite a while \^\^
---
Interestingly enough I see most posts negative. Oh, and there's no discussion at all.
---
Wowwildstar: the hardcore only game ... Great example
---
You are the one lumping together all opposition, not those expressing opposing opinions. Might want to let that sit for a minute before replying so you dont make a fool of yourself.
---
Form and function are very different in this case.
---
Back items were likely coded as weapons as a shortcut during initial development. They function like armor in the same way that weapons do, in that they are anchored to your body at a certain point and have some animation to them. But that doesn‚Äôt mean that weapons are armor.
---
Not to mention, the backend code is likely *wildly* different, especially given the horror stories we‚Äôve heard about the code base.
---
I see you fit this post's audience.
---
Yeah you probably should have added "outside the US" just to be clear.
---
If you LOS everything and burn quick you can actually get the camp 70% capped before swords even show up.
---
[Read this thread](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/86029/what-happened-to-the-question-and-answer-part-of-the-event). Even the daily Anet yes-man Illconceived is displeased with their attitude. Look at the summary he did for ignored topics. You say community overreacts, I say anet is reaponsible for this. People are starving for information, for confirmation there is something to wait for, in all game areas. In reaponse they get "yo dogs, more story for ya'.
---
I would say, Anet is acting very toxic, passive aggressively with their customers.
---
ignorant post. =p
---
I adore this game, I play casually with friends but we've been paying attention and the way they handled this whole thing has kind of killed our enthusiasim, especially when a lot of other mmo's are killing it with  customer engagement (warframe and ffxiv are starting to be our new hang out game).
---
Im a little upset because gw2 has such a great community in it but the game feels starved, hell even strangled at this point for updates and desperately needed reworks.
---
I hope Anet turn this all around, the game has such a great core premise.
---
I can't speak for ArenaNet, but this post (nor my comments) wasn't about the general letdown of the hype.  It was about people saying they want the game to die because &lt;insert Anet inflammatory remark&gt; and &lt;insert inflammatory remark against the community who support Anet despite the fact things are lackluster right now.&gt;
---
Same, was surprised when I logged in since I already got my mail.
---
Considering anet marketing and MikeZ forum posts I think they definitely dont have another expansion in works.
---
\&gt;Players in the actual game are not like this at all, I have never ran across anyone in the game who acts like you guys, and I'm ashamed to say if you do play this game that I'm glad to say we've never met.
---
The people who you are talking about stopped playing the game.
---
As someone with an alt linked worth the French this week, can confirm, we are ruined bcz of lack of communication, chats are in French, don't understand what's going on, am put off
---
Imagine actually thinking there are a only a few toxic posts.
---
This thread/topic alone is at least 50% toxic assholes spewing crap all over.
---
Just because you agree with something someone says, doesn't mean they aren't being an asshole.
---
Yeah, I get it. I'm old. Change comes hard. Fortunately, I don't live in the US and don't worry overly (beyond how everyone in the world worries about who's in charge in the White House), but I get you. The world is nuts. And this really isn't that bad.
---
The difference is, I come here, and I tend to avoid political forums, because I have enough stress in my life.
---
Guild Wars 2 is a game. It was made to be enjoyed. Some people aren't enjoying it, and those people are angry. How they express that anger is really their business.   Doesn't mean I have to like it. lol
---
Housing is the one that i want the most and the one that i dont want as well. It will suck all my time and wallet. Please make it happen but no expensive furniture like guild halls
---
Probably right.
---
Not only are you laggy, but you have poor fps.rip your PvP/wvw dreams.
---
[insert spaghetti here]
---
That's all well and good but how many death threats did they receive?
---
Dude was sweating bullets because he knew they had jack shit to present to us other than a trailer and Strike Missions.
---
Of course, but it still means that if you either know Japanese or have someone who can post for you, it's far easier to get into contact.
---
I mean you got to know English to have any chance of ANet talking to/at you, too.
---
IF you bought HOT, else you won't be even getting that
---
There is like 10% quality of life in FFX that is present in GW2 and honestly with limited time to play, that was one of the big deal breakers for me.
---
Plus the starting quests and global skill cooldown. I did love the character customization though, but that's barely any salvation.
---
Wildstar had amazing housing though. Rift was really cool with housing too.
---
But that will not be a new season, its called Saga.
---
They haven't officially replied to anyone yet. This is a really really simple situation.
---
1000 complaints. 5 threats. Which do I reply to? The five threats. Because those are wrong.
---
I don't know what gives anyone the idea here that Rubi is ALLOWED to reply to a hullabaloo of this magnitude. This is going to take some meetings and some writing and some decisions from the top. It's going to take time to figure out how best to fix things. Rubi was simply saying that you shouldn't threaten people.
---
I didn't see her lump all posts into one category. CLearly she got personal attacks privately and you guys don't care, because you're angry at Anet's fuck up. Well that's fucked up to me.
---
I wouldn't say that 30 FPS is poor. It's still well playable. It would probably be faster if I dropped to lower settings though; I'm running the highest settings because it was recommended by NVIDIA GeForce Experience.
---
They only way is found is just doing the hearths every day with every character u have.
---
Willfully mischaracterizing Anet‚Äôs response? Yes, I‚Äôd call that toxicity
---
This sub has gone down the shitter.
---
These are the people who roam this subreddit, this will be downvoted to hell and beyond.
---
What is beyond hell btw?
---
Go to a primary server, or you risk getting linked with YB and you are right back where you started...lol
---
&gt; so reporting definitely are useful.
---
from what I understood this is the ONLY way to actually get them banned or suspended. There is no one at ArenaNet or software monitoring the chat so if you see someone insult someone else or yourself you have to report them.
---
The same with bugs you encounter. I don't even want to know how long bugs go unnoticed just because people encounter them, post on reddit and expect it to get fixed instead of just submitting a bug report.
---
So what did you ask them?
---
I‚Äôm aware it will be downvoted, and admittedly I don‚Äôt mind that. I might take it down so if it does cause too much of a stir. 
---
I don‚Äôt quite understand what you mean, though. I just enjoy making a small meme and posting just as a joke, so if there‚Äôs something I‚Äôm missing please let me know. 
---
For that last one I don‚Äôt quite get what you mean?? Am I just tired or something?
---
&gt; If you feel it's not going to stop no matter what you do, you're not reporting the toxicity or letting them know that what they're doing is not okay.
---
You can report them if you like, and perhaps the moderators can remove those posts, if there is a functioning report option. "letting them know that what they're doing is not ok" is counterproductive though. 
---
**They know that what they are doing is not ok.**
---
At least by your standards. And they don't care. They *won't* care. Letting them know that what they're doing is not ok" is not slowing their behavior, it is accelerating it. It is not making them feel ashamed of their behavior and thus less likely to repeat it, it is *rewarding* their behavior by providing the reaction they desired. It will cause them to do more of it, it is causing other trolls to arrive and join into the feeding frenzy.
---
**It is making the situation worse.**
---
&gt;The same logic applies to real world comments. You wouldn't ignore somebody using a slur against somebody else in front of you unless you were okay with it.
---
Perhaps, but people in real life *tend* to be more susceptible to shaming tactics. Tactics that work in real life do not always apply to the Internet, and vice-versa. 
---
Again, **if** it were possible to "shut down" bad actors online, then great, do that. 
---
But it's not possible. 
---
So all you're advocating is feeding the fire, giving it what it wants, what makes it stronger. I'm not condoning their bad behavior, I'm just telling you that *you* should stop enabling it. I feel that *you* have enough conscience to be better than you have been.
---
NCSOFT is nor human, nor Company, it's an incarnation of devil. It's past speaks for itself, just one of the examples: City of Heroes
---
The prologue is coming out soon. We know what will happen in the story told in season 5 and some other things like reused masteries and not a new map with each episode.
---
From that, we don't know if there will be new elite specs or not so I would wait until the prologue is out so that we actually start the season to know more.
---
Only a minority are being abusive. Truth be told, only a minority are even being vocal. I'd wager most people are mildly disappointed and will just go play something else.
---
It's an important question. What is worse than hell?
---
So you think they will introduce Elite specs with this new "saga"?
---
Hm. It varies. I suppose for me something worse than hell is being forgotten all together. 
---
Or a thousand paper cuts. Really, both are just as painful.
---
No. Contrary to popular belief, there were plenty of posts doing things such as RNG research, suggestions, questions that got answered, and the occasional released tool.
---
The recent storm of complaints likes to pretend that its the only state the sub has ever been, but it's a blatant falsehood. Not *Everything* was useful, as there was plenty of fluff such as legendary construction or showing off fashion, but these things came and went.
---
It's all a matter of waiting out the most recent drama.
---
Might be wrong, but I remember that it was somewhat mentioned. After being asked, what Kind of difference there is, they said they now work with 4 Teams. And it won't always be the same Content updates, due to the 4 Teams. 
---
Now this only makes sense if it's actually more frequent. But only an assumption, after all. Honestly, would be pretty stupid to say "we now have 4 Teams, so it won't always be living world. If you get invested in it, you have to wait instead of 4 months 16 months."
---
No, but there are cool new t-shirts and bobble head figures
---
So around 6. Around SIX people. If you tweet that you're going for a shit more people than that will wish you a glorious death. I don't like modern internet, but for better or worse, it's not a safe space by any means and you risk being called human garbage by saying anything.  Stop being outraged by the outrage.
---
Rubi has a front facing position at her work and if she talks about her work as a private individual she will be judged for her work.
---
At least a year
---
It‚Äôs a t-shirt poncho cape! A tonchape!
---
No it's everyone believing that because the devs are for real this time and no one is doing other projects, the 4 dedicated teams will now churn out content in a more frequent and steady pace because they're focused this time and why would they lie to us
---
&gt; We have a climate change denier as the head of the EPA in the USA
---
Well good. Then you still have somewhat intelligent people in office in the US. 
---
But googling Mr. Wheeler tells me that he's not a climate change denier at all, he said
---
&gt; I believe that man has an impact on the climate but what's not completely understood is what the impact is.
---
which is 100% correct, and
---
&gt; I do not believe that climate change is an existential threat.
---
which is also correct.
---
Path of Exile's community managers: [Bex](https://old.reddit.com/user/Bex_GGG/submitted/?sort=top&amp;t=year) &amp; [Natalia](https://old.reddit.com/user/Natalia_GGG/submitted/) - sort by submission; and you'll see they're active members of the community.  It doesn't feel forced or contrived; it feels like they're just as excited as we are and are happy to showcase new development and content.  The parallel to GW2 would be random animated .gifs, screenshots, some controlled rune, sigil or trait reveals.  The living story has lulls where for 1-2 months you fall back into the same routine (or leave the game entirely) and these sorts of things help keep people excited.  
---
ArenaNet has occasionally done great work teasing content.  Unfortunately, it's not consistent and it makes it difficult to stay motivated and enthusiastic about the state of the game.  I know that they're trying; teasers like the animated .gif of W5 / Hall of Chains and a few of the screen-shots that popped up in that time period were excellent.  However, that should be the norm not the exception.  I think that NCSoft and upper management need to start asking themselves what other companies are doing that they are not.
---
Community: communicate to us!
---
Anet: holds announcement
---
Community: no, not like that
---
Also they usually make players:
---
* Creating dedicated heroes (buying slots)
---
* Getting more skins of all types (crafting, gems, converting gems)
---
* Crafting gear/leges (crafting, gems, converting gems)
---
* Occasionally buying extra upgrades for certain heroes like bag slots (buying gems)
---
Downside is: increased balance manpower, but it might be justified to hire more people if it increases revenue.
---
It depends on your favorite playstyle though. Necro can do direct damage (‚Äûburst‚Äú) or damage over time with conditions.
---
For leveling, I find it comfortable using direct damage.
---
Now which weapons would you use? Axe in the mainhand would be my suggestion; medium range and great burst. Alternatively dagger mainhand.
---
For the offhand, I‚Äòd recommend a warhorn for mobility.
---
For the second set: a staff is great if you want to have the possibility to damage from far away. Otherwise you could consider dagger/warhorn or dagger/focus, for instance.
---
Now if you‚Äòd rather go condition damage, you‚Äòll want to look into a scepter mainhand and dagger offhand.
---
And more generally speaking, metabattle.com is a descend place to get ideas for your build (which skills, weapons, stats, etc.). They have builds for ‚Äûopen world‚Äú too.
---
"But is it wrong to hope? After 7 years, we've seen alot and got disappointed many times. As much as it hurts to say, don't get hyped in GW2. Unless they prove us wrong once, they aren't good at it. They cannot deliver what we expect."
---
They can't deliver what you expect, for sure. I'm not so sure about me. The stuff that's delivered? Pretty much what I expect.
---
Occasionally though they surprise me. Mounts surprised me. The Skyscale surprised me and that wasn't all that long ago.
---
Not that we're exactly in a content draught anyway, but some demographics are woefully unrepresented in the plans that were announced. If I were a WvW player I'd eat my own head about now. It must be horrible frustrating. 
---
But what I expect. Nothing that happened was outside of my personal range of expectations. I tried to tell people beforehand what I thought would happen. Best I could do.
---
The truth is, Anet has met some people's expectations, because I don't think most people have expectations in the first place. Just a guess, mind you.
---
What I think will happen is that they swap over any raid devs to start making only strikes, same way they abandoned dungeons in favour of fractals.
---
The point is that even players who mostly enjoy the story and open world content (such as myself) tend to really enjoy more gameplay options. Elite specs can excite all players, not just hardcore Raiders and PvP/WvW players but also casual PvE players. 
---
Elite specs are one of the things that have the most value in terms of new features, especially because they affect and excite all those different groups of players. New story, new raids, new pvp modes, new armor skins, higher cooking level, new races, new masteries and so on will never affect all players the way elite specs do. 
---
So in that regard I disagree with you since you seem to suggest that elite specs are only for the more hardcore and/or competitive players.
---
Have you read the mesmer profession "forum" in the past? 90% of the time the established mesmer mains were civil, constructive and even offered compromises in their opening posts unlike the "buff us, nerf the rest!" mantra you'd normally expect; with a side of sarcasm from Pyro.
---
Seemingly none of these posts were ever heeded, let alone replied to. Elusive Mind was discussed at length and **NERFS** brainstormed *months* before any of the PvP whiners took issue with it.
---
But why go for an intelligent fix when you can just give it a double whack with the nerf bat to make the whiners happy? You know, the people who post things like "mezmer OP, perma dodge 6 illusions telports evry 5 sekunds bursts you ded instantly in tank gear, NERF NAO!"
---
Fighting buffed open world bosses won't make people play more raids. They were saying previously that fractal cms are stepping stone to raids - they aren't.
---
You know what is stepping stone to raids? Easy mode raids.
---
I'm not against strike missions, but I don't believe they will be what people think. They will be bounties 2.0, similar to dragon bash bosses we had recently. It's nothing like raiding and it won't push people into raids.
---
My guess is that most of the things are still under development and Anet does not want to release anything until they are ready lol
---
Truly, I think the HoT shirt outfit doesn‚Äôt deserve any credit.
---
Probably more than you can imagine, PoE Reddit posters are pretty critical (and not in a nice way usually) complains are left right and everywhere about anything and everything. Some warranted some less.
---
But instead of posting about how toxic people are, they reply to criticism with explanations and reasons for certain things. As well as updates on what their working on very often amd what they will be focusing in the near future. Theyre constantly active on reddit when concerns like this pop up. They assist Podcast (last league the lead developer and ceo was on a 2 hour pod cast )
---
I remember hopping on skype and having a quick convo with chris wilson over an issue they were having after I offered advice on the forums.  Straight up good dudes and I'm happy with every dollar I've tossed their way.
---
Path of fire had little reason for them to work on it. It came out completely unpolished and it shows. They didn't talk about it and then had no obligation of "guys its been 6 months, we can't release it like this." They just rolled out whatever they had and now it gets less play than an expansion that's 2 years older.
---
Yeah all that bad feedback they got about HoT masteries taking too long to unlock, about elite specs taking too long to unlock, about the map currencies being too grindy, about how the maps felt empty outside of the meta events - they definitely didn't immediately stop development on everything else and put the entire company on doing a polish pass on HoT. Ironically it was a response to criticisms of HoT that created PoF maps with no major metas (focus on exploration instead of on the rails single purpose meta maps was one of the biggest HoT complaints).
---
Fractal instabilities haven't changed as a direct result of feedback. They definitely didn't let us literally vote on whether or not we wanted to keep Desert BL in WvW (and in what form - rotating one week on or off with Alpine or the current version).
---
If the bar they have to meet is content before it's released then maybe it's worth looking at the history of dye unlocks from the beta.
---
Just because they didn't put in every feature exactly as you wanted it exactly when you wanted it does not mean they are stupid or do not respond to feedback. They are juggling a lot of plates, they have a limited budget and a big game to make decisions for. Not everything they want to happen can happen and it certainly all won't happen as fast as we want it to happen.
---
Everytime I see these kind of examples of how other company devs communicate with their community, I wonder if people had simply forgot about the whole Jessica Price junk. 
---
We had pretty great dev interaction, but it only takes 1 PR fiasco like that for a company to reign that all in out of fear of that happening again.
---
That and dyable weapons would make me cream my pants.
---
Sorry but whats a strike mission? I didnt watch the stream so i might have missed it
---
I would still get bored of WvW even if they had better rewards.  I want a different approach.
---
OP you're blind to anything past the surface. That's why you simply dont notice both in game and in the past, nor saw this coming.
---
These people arent trolls. They're gw2 players. Plenty of them probably with more playtime, gems bought and investment too. There has been LONG growing resentment and issues that have not been addressed. When these things were outlined, typically the posts were buried aggressively by toxic casuals and whiteknights. "If you dont like the game go play something else" is a standard response here.
---
Then after months of that and another major flop of an announcement you're surprised what you notice in game isnt the same as what you notice on reddit? Because outside of the super casual "I dont interact with people" openworld style of play this was pretty clear and has been building up a long time.
---
Also part is counter reaction against the disgusting anet whiteknights that will constantly dismiss criticism so it does turn into toxicity when the bucket flows over.
---
If you wait until casual players realise what is going on you're probably a year too late. Because to be entirely honest they simply wont realise or notice anything until it festers to a point where it's so obvious they cant deny it anymore. Any time before that its just "this isnt a problem because I can't tell it exists". Even if that says more about the player than the state of the game.
---
You are correct tho, more and more of these "trolls" are not playing. Why do you think these people want to "troll" this game / sub?
---
&gt;Contrary to popular belief the customer is not always right
---
This is what ungrateful people say when others pay them money.
---
Guys they basically said a similar things about the mini VG in bloodstone fen.
---
I think this will basically be as popular as the bounties system.
---
I was hyped for GW2. Fell for their manifesto. I overlooked some of my minor gripes with the game, but when Heart of Thorns hit, I knew this game would never be like GW1.
---
What's got me is the number of not-solid things. There are loads of vines and roots used as scenery in Caledon Forest that look solid but aren't.
---
I posted this under another comment:
---
AoC is almost certainly Ashes of Creation.  They're stuck in the Battle Royale Dev mode and it's been quite a cluster.
---
/r/AshesofCreation
---
Because they seem capable of expressing their feelings towards us on Twitter.
---
&gt; The renamed raids ("Strike missions")
---
We don't know if Strikes are going to be the replacement of raids. I sure hope it's not, and they'll keep on delivering raids.
---
Yeah everyone spontaneously dropping your product is pretty much the definition of a crisis for your company.
---
My guess: you can eat it? :)
---
Introduced friend into raids 3 weeks ago. Did all in pugs and he was surprised how chill all bosses were. It's really not that hard if you have someone in voice telling you what to do. After 2 runs he was able to go alone with grps.
---
They're *supposed* to be cheap easy options for WvW zerglings so they don't have to sit and craft or scour he TP. The portable provisioner also happens to be useful for people with a WvW allergy and thousands of badges from achievement chests to do the Big Spender daily.
---
Oh and at least the stew is useful for open world mirages because it's cheap enough to not feel bad about perma upkeep while potentially granting a 30% boost to your survivability *and* your dps.
---
They're both story rich MMOs.
---
You're the problem. You have been refusing to acknowledge criticism and actively whiteknighting for anet so long you dont realise it'll only make the game and the community worse over time.
---
You can yell REEEEE put your hands in your ears, close your eyes and repeatedly tell yourself gw2 is the best game with the friendliest community as much as you like. Your attitude prevents feedback and you have a history of being toxic even when feedback is constructive.
---
Keep it up, I'm sure itll work.
---
Waste of money.
---
Strike missions are going to be bounties 2.0
---
Gw has been on milk casuals while dedicating resources elsewhere for years. The community just getting to a point where they cant even deny it. After ncsoft and announcements everyone goes JUST WAIT AND SEE. But yet again this announcement showed anet is neither willing nor capable to do anything other than recycle their dragon story to put out mediocre trivial content and beg you for $gemz$.
---
My wishlist would be,  
---
Dyable backpacks, it's like top priority
---
Fishing, yea it'd be nice.
---
New Elite Specs (to justify making more characters)
---
New cosmetics as WvW rewards, be it unqiue or not I don't care as long as it's something newly obtainable from wvw (Sadly most of raid rewards and high grind achievement weapon/armors falls into this category, which might make some pve players very happy about it)
---
New WvW map or maps. If balance is the issue, there could be Alphine week, Desert week, Old City week etc. They don't really need to be extremely different from each other, just dye them different, sprinkle some extra buildings around and ta-daa. There could be a deviation from certain formula "3 keeps per border" even, give us an extremely small map for example, put 3 towers, 3 camps and a keep (similar to Eternal Battlegrounds) and call it a day. GvG would be so much fun with alliances coming up with small maps. Quicker I get into fight, less bored and time invested for the fun I get.
---
New WvW challange maps or mods (my idea mostly) Give us, waiting in the queue, something to do. We could capture the flag for our map point tally on small random generated maps, defend a fully sieged tower against a full siege scenario 10vs10, anything that takes about 15 to 30 minutes most. Make it pve if it's too much trouble even, I don't care as long as I don't stare at a bank npc or kill rats on a random world map just to kill time. Anet must understand, while it's nice to have, WvW players are not playing this game for the rewards, we play it for it's own flavour, which not a single other game has.
---
I often delete my account because conservatives on reddit used to be tagged and doxxed site wide. I was on one of their lists.
---
PvE leaderboards
---
I'm desperately trying to get one of you to show me where she said the thing you're accusing her of saying. Nobody has been able yet.
---
GGG is such a good example of what should be standard developer behavior. He loves to actually play the game; he loves to discuss the game and engage with the forums; **he loves to take time out of his busy developer/CEO schedule to show up on tiny fan podcasts that barely get a few thousand views just because he cares.**
---
I burnt out from playing too much two years back but every quarter I still smile at their new league/quarterly-content updates and go peek into their subreddit to check out what's going on.
---
They have the same issues of neglecting certain skills or going in questionable design or balance directions as Arena Net, but the community at large LOVES them nonetheless because they constantly communicate, indicate what direction they're headed in, explain their reasonings, and let themselves be human in a positive and forgivable fashion.
---
Bless Chris Wilson, bless Bex, and bless the whole lot at GGG.
---
Games bleed players. It's what happens over time. GW2 is an OLD ass game. People leave. That doesn't necessarily mean the game is bad.
---
Budget dodge food is fairly decent. Besides never should have been in the game in the first place.
---
Iam afraid they will be only  new version of Bounties.
---
-they said its "up to" 10 players. So it can be done with less. Probably it will scale. Basicly its not a bad thing, but less type of mechanics can be done with this way.
---
-they said it can work with automated group finding. I think it basicly will be the same as the last Dragon Bash:Dragon Arena was. You interact with a marker and you will get an instance with some random players. But till you cannot define your role it will randomly group up players. Your group may not have healer, boon support (might, fury, quickness, alacrity..etc). So if it can be done with 10 random (openworld) builds it will be very casual and very easy. I think it will be about the same level in difficulty as a Bounty so even easier than t4 fractals and then it wont help anything about the raiding.
---
-iam a bit afraid that developing this feature will slow the developing of the upcoming new raids if the same developers working on them and that would be really bad thing for the players whos seeking a bit challenging PvE contents.
---
I feel like whoever really wanted those skins would've gotten them by now

The mini VG would be viable if only 10 people showed up to kill it.

When you admit to your faults, the community can be very forgiving. Explain, condense information and show that you are willing to improve.

I feel like GGG and Digital Extremes should be the standard for companies, as you mentioned GGG CEO often joins podcasts and is active on social media and forums and most importantly he takes feedback and doesn't get offended by criticism. Digital Extremes is the same, but they have their own streams showing upcoming content, aka Prime Time. While Anet has basically fuck all to communicate with the community and the devs cry with the slightest criticism.
---
The actually good merchandise is made by the gw2 artist collective (makers of the tarot among other things). And all the exposure they got during that event is their lead being asked what she loves about gw2.
---
The garbage leggings, the dumb phonecase and the tidal shit? Yeah, main stage.
---
you are absolutely being toxic!!
---
read your comments, you are vulgar, antagonistic for no reason!
---
Anet get less and less revenue because they follow this rather dumb reasoning.
---
Sure there were more casual openworld players than wvw, pvp or raid players. Yet each of these modes are valuable and have better options for growth than casual pve. Anet went all in on one group, lost various minority groups which added up made up a lot of players.
---
Their content output, revenue and studio size have all been going downhill for obvious reasons, good management isnt one of them.
---
Ok soo no more new elite spec pls cos ppl don't have time to lean that...
---
Orly?
---
This is very shortsighted interpretation of GW2. ArenaNet is big enough to provide content for all game modes - open world/story, raids and fractals, pvp and wvw. However they are supporting mostly only one of those, leaving majority of a game with slow and half assed updates.
---
This game is built with premise of inclusivity and no gear progression. This by itself allows for much better accessibility for new players. However, lack of gear treadmill is paired with probably the best combat system of all mmos on the market. If we connect these two, it should be natural to push for game modes that utilize combat more.
---
Unfortunately, all the amazing build and combat systems of GW2 are wasted. Majority of development is focused on 30% of available game modes. And those game modes - story and open world - do not allow for satisfying usage of combat and build systems. The content there is too simple.
---
People were making many suggestions for mor engaging content. Not instead of story and open world, but as addition. Damn, the most reasonable idea was probably to make story instances and bosses into optional hard mode challenges with proper, punishable mechanics.
---
People want to play this game, but as suggestions are getting ignored all the time by dev company, the frustration arises. People see wasted potential and lackluster development outside of open world and story.
---
That's depressing, because this mmo, if properly supported, was rare example of true WoW killer candidate.
---
Legally speaking, they are. This comes from the latin persona, meaning mask. A corporation can appear in court as a plaintiff or defendant, but as it isn't a natural person, it cannot go to prison, it can only give or take money. In severe cases it can be liquidated. Then again, in the USA the law can also 'liquidate' natural persons. Corporations cannot vote in an election, but they can form interest groups and ask politely, that politicians heed their advice.
---
As for Sagas, they are like mini LW seasons? Or larger? From what I got, there are fewer restrictions when it comes to types of content released in a saga, but the scope of an individual release will be smaller. That doesn't sound surprising when it comes from a studio, that had to let go a good portion of their staff. 
---
The announcement was probably mandated by NC-Soft, who are always hungry for money. NC-Soft is publicly traded and the majority of shares are free floating and the largest owners are the South-Korean National Pension Service, NC-Soft's founder/CEO Taek Jin Kim and Netmarble Games, RoK's largest gaming company. Net Marble and the Pension fund are in it for the money. I assume the vast majority of free floating shares to be held by private investors. Taek Jin Kim was also a member of Arenanet's board, so I'd say he's the most benign of the NC-Soft owners, but he has to represent the interests of all of NC-Soft. Corporations are not natural persons, but corporate decisions are made by natural persons.
---
My bet is on achievements matching with party size.
---
And none of those sane customers are being listened to either, instead the store is complaining about that one drunk and crying about it.   
---
There has been TONS of constructive criticism, you ignoring it won't change that or validate your opinion
---
When people can't take the time to nicely say, "Next time, could you please salt it less?" and instead go with "OMG this steak was so salty, I can't believe it they did this to me! It's not what I wanted. I'm going to Yelp to give the shittiest review and I will tell others to do the same! Fuck you, fuck the cooks and fuck the wait staff!" They can honestly go suck it. This is basically the sub.
---
Casuals are locusts that demand attention, affection, content and people to play with them but as soon as games cater to them most of all they turn to shite, the top end goes elsewhere and eventually the casuals and whales all follow.

pretty sure it's a hawk

Higher in what category?

Even OSRS devs host videos talking about changes they want to include and respond to questions from their player base
---
Companies consist of people, tho. They aren't a single entity that thinks by itsself. It is people that decide on things.

Your like that aliens guy who pretends we don't know how volcanoes work so he can claim aliens start eruptions
---
your points a and b are fair, but hindsight is 20/20... I don't think they expected to do a loosy job
---
&gt; Yes, fix it. I do weekend work when needed, and while I do think we need to be careful about work/life balance, if something gets fucked up, asking people to come in and then giving them some comp time to balance out isn't unreasonable.
---
it is unreasonable, you're asking for weekend work because you were not happy with how a game presentation went...
---
&gt;Consumer backlash is precisely the balancing part that helps incentives to be unethical be less extreme.
---
if it were true there would be no microtransactions, there would be no Epic Game Store exclusivity, unfortunately for you people still buy A LOT
---
 consumer backlash barely works, consumer not consuming works though (only reason we saw changes in battlefront 2 was the disapointing sales, not the backlash)
---
I meant in terms of execution
---
Keep in mind that the worst offenders get indeed reported and deleted, sometimes even shadow(banned). But yeah, from a hundred positives posts maybe three survive, while shitting on the game has been this sub's favourite pasttime for quite a while now. Remember the ded gaem flood thanks to some twitch streamers incel army that actually forced the mods to implement regular "don't be an arsehole" rules?
---
That weeded many of the worst shitstains out, but the general negativity is still *intense*, the hostility towards people who dare to simply enjoy the game as well, and God forbid we stop this sub from becoming an echo chamber of how bad things are. Even if that were true, it's not only not productive, it actively turns everyone away who doesn't share that opinion. No-one enjoying himself wants to get bombarded left and right with negativity. 
---
**TL;DR Know that popular meme? "I never knew how little I enjoyed the game until I joined a "fan" forum about it."**
---
I too agree Anet should not ‚Äòonly‚Äô focus on casual players, but I think there might be a good reason for them to focus more on casual game plays.
---
Well, being a wow killer candidate does not necessarily mean you will have to prevail at what wow was already good at... From a different approach, as long as it meets the demand of most of its audience. Asymmetrical development might no be the worst all the time.
---
You put yourself through the struggle of playing multiple accounts at once and then say anything thaz is more than logging in is too much.
---
Yeah... why not...
---
Corporations don't operate purely on profit.
---
They care about growth. Every quarter, they check in. If the growth starts suggesting decline, they cash out. It's as simple and cutthroat as that. 
---
That's why you get situations like EA going from old-school top-tier developer to the game's industry's satan-incarnate. Studios that go corporate grow too much, bring in too many market/stock-minded people who only care about short-term, and it changes the studio's fundamental values.
---
This has been going on for decades in every industry. A callous system that promotes dog-eat-dog mentalities.
---
i agree with you. i made a few toons at launch and left the game soon after, i returned to the game at lws3.2. i had a lot of catching up to do.
---
i play the new content story over maybe 2 weekends when i know i have at least 5 hours to sit down in one go. weekdays when i get home from work i log into my 4 alt accounts for log in dailies and flax farm every 60+ toon i have (maybe 17 toons over 4 accounts) and that takes 10 minutes, then do my 3 quest/event/harvest dailies on my main account
---
i have completed the final story in dragonfall. when that story was over i went back to grinding ap from previous chapters until i have squeezed out as much as i can. right now i am in kourna and having difficulty getting 1 more cheev. i have to make an ascended banner or get gold griffon flying or upgrade all my turrets. then i will go to jahai, thunderhead and dragonfall to squeeze out as much ap as possible. i have yet to attempt to squeeze out ap from the pof maps. ap hunting gets interrupted every festival where i hunt ap and loot from them
---
i do have the skyscale and 295 masteries unlocked, 100% world completes on 3 characters, my main character has 100% on core/s2/hot/s3/pof/s4 and 15k ap
---
as far as i am concerned the stories are too fast for me. there is sooooo much to do. i havent even found time to do more than skim over dungeons, fractals, raids and wvw. i have just done enough of those to get bits i needed for other collections like the 2 legendary weapons i wanted (eternity and meteorlogicus)
---
How are new elite specs a time gate?
---
No bans so far.
---
Sure and when that constructive criticism is layered in sarcastic bullshit, whining, bitching, etc, no one is going to read it. Development for any business means taking the user's needs and turning it into what is required and at the same time functional.  When the end user is a vile tossing demon who has the emotional capacity of a toddler on crack, no one is going to ask you what you want.
---
&gt;The one thing you all are going to accomplish at this rate it showing any new or potential players that they should put down their weapons and go somewhere else
---
Implying I'd recommend this game to anybody, every single person I got to play (over 10) has left, this game is in the shit for a while it isn't something that just started. the difference is now the recurrent players had enough too
---
The first mail was the TShirt?
---
Because the story in GW2 is absolutely awful and the only people who 'like' the story are either tasteless or delusional fanboys, which is the inherent problem that is ruining the game. The people who actually cared about the game, who criticised it have been constantly bashed throughout the entire game's history to the point where pretty much everyone who was actually dedicated has quit. This has left the game full of apologists, whales and casuals who either don't care much about the game, or are eager to defend the game on everything even when it is almost undeniably terrible. 
---
I once commented in a guild how a recent story of the game was pretty bad and almost instantly a person came up and attacked me personally and told me I was the reason why the community is toxic. 
---
But I digress, my original comment was more of a meme/joke but it kinda reflects my entire sentiment of the community.
---
Don't worry, they'll end up being worse. Probably less clear visuals, with the excuse that there's no 50 players around, only 10. So you'll keep having people die to abilities they could have easily avoided if they could see them.
---
You're just buffer content between real content.
---
Preach brother/sister!
---
What I think is childish, annoying and definitely toxic is the fact that you care about karma. If everybody was the opposite you'd do the exact same shit and downvote anybody who isn't positive.   
---
Face it people are unhappy and not interested in useless, false positivity when there's none to be had, you do you fam but by the downvotes people are clearly not interested in ignoring anets failures anymore and you have 0 moral high ground to be shitting on them for it.
---
You see them getting more revenue? Putting out more content? Growing their company? Ohwait too soon? Putting out newer games? Growing their playerbase? Marketing their product well? 
---
Ah shit.
---
Dont buy it in g2a men. Buy the expansion in the official arenanet webpage.

&gt; In addition, this paper proves that the changes in the low cloud cover fraction practically control the global temperature.
---
Still unclear what causes the changes to low cloud cover.
---
&gt; -iam a bit afraid that developing this feature will slow the developing of the upcoming new raids if the same developers working on them and that would be really bad thing for the players whos seeking a bit challenging PvE contents.
---
After over a decade of designing raids most games end up recycling mechanics anyway. Would it be so bad if they repurposed strike mechanics into new raids, essentially benefiting twice from the same work? Less experienced players can pick up some of the most dangerous mechanics running the strike from the last episode, and then when it's reused in the raid (along with other new mechanics) it's less overwhelming for them.
---
Strikes could actually help raid development by workshopping new mechanics to use in raids and introducing inexperienced raiders to them in a lower pressure environment, making it easier to deal with it in a real environment.
---
I really hope Anet never does this.  Change things based on just reddit feedback?  Actually they do this already to some extend based on a relatively small number of people on reddit and offical forums.  
---
While reddit people may feel they are the majority and they represent basically everyone, it is far from the truth.
---
Real changes can include discussion and thoughts from online forums, that's fine, but decisions shouldn't be primarily based on that.  Players often think they know best when really they don't and can't even agree among themselves when it comes to actual details and implementations that are specific.  
---
If it's a change that is going to be inspired mainly by player feedback (instead of it just being but one component of many), then that should be done inside the game itself.  Set up polls and more inside the game itself to accurately acquire real, actual representation from the actual real players, not the small group that come to forums.  
---
In addition to it being far more representative than reddit or Anet official forums, that will allow far greater understanding upon which kind of players support which decisions because in the game, it's easy for them to see how active said players are and what content they actually touch.
---
Personally, I don't want a bunch of PvE raiders who never play WvW to decide the fate of important WvW decisions nor would I want SPvP players who never PvE to decide what's best for fractals and so forth.  That's just the beginning of the benefits of offering actual polls and feedback inside the game itself.
---
I guess you thought when I said "criticisms" in the original post I meant about valid criticism?  Unfortunately, no... what I meant what when someone attacks someone for little to no reason, calls it criticism and an opinion, and then the person they effectively attacked retaliates -- suddenly the original attacker cannot take the same criticism and disrespect that they dished out originally.
---
If people want to disagree on a variety of actual game issues, sure.  But I'm specifically talking about people who go out of their way to hate on anyone who genuinely appreciates the game, even if it's a small comment of appreciation -- or a suggestion that things take time, even now.
---
The people who tell others to fuck off for any reason should get their priorities straight.  I don't care if their reasoning is sound or not, it isn't appropriate and it causes their original "valid criticism" to fall on deaf ears.
---
Still sane?
---
i honestly dont think elite specs or expacs are happening ever again.
---
Fractals are dungeons with a different reward table. If you pulled fractals out of GW2 and dropped them into WoW people would just call them dungeons.
---
WoW's current take on dungeons actually has a difficult scaling system, like fractals, and additional effects on higher difficulties, just like fractals.
---
Fractals are dungeons.
---
Each  spec means 250 heros points to get.
---
You have 3 options : create one new toons and redo the easy "free" heros challenges, use your current toons and  go do all the difficult heros challenges you previously skipped, or go  pvp or wvw to farms levels.
---
It is not a probl√®me for people who do everything and have full map on all their toons but for the other it is just another content to grind before being able to play with other.
---
This happens in literally any vibrant online community. PoE, GW2, or any other game, is not an exception.
---
&gt;If I were dev and wasn't forced to work on weekends I wouldn't give a crap what community thinks during my free time.  Most people (like you and me) work to live, not live to work.
---
I probably would care and I imagine many of the devs care as well. That said, would be smart to keep anything you have to say for yourself and wait for an official response as stepping in can do more harm than good, especially if it's not your job to do so.
---
Six too many, dude.
---
You literally said there's barely any positive feedback and legitimate criticism when there very clearly is and always has been.   
---
Right now your accusing people of being radical for disagreeing with your viewpoint and your salty they aren't positive. Not all negativity is bad and def not all negativity is extreme/toxic. Your overblowing it a lot while accusing people of doing the same lmao
---
Thank you.
---
You do understand that whiteknights and suppressing criticism is exactly what leads to this right? 
---
Any criticism they respond in a backhand toxic way that everything is fine, concerns and criticisms arent welcome and oh by the way, fuck off and play another game because this one isnt for you.
---
Then you're surprised after doing this for years that constructive criticism doesnt get heard, more and more people get bitter and you get backlash that contrasts with the happy delusion you demand to portray but isnt actually representative of the state of the game.
---
People becoming upset and bitter is a pretty direct response to how criticism, no matter how constructive, is buried by both anet and a certain part of the community. What you are doing isnt friendly and wont make it better, itll make it worse.
---
&gt; instead of putting the onus 100% on devs to pacify the people sending threats, hate mail, and abuse?
---
Wow, that's so delusional. Because yeah, you were **obviously** supposed to do that. Geez, modern black/white "argumentation" is really sad. No comparative views, no nothing. Just "You either love us, or you hate us, and if it's the latter then fuck off".
---
Also if it gave rewards worth the time investment.
---
Who the fuck gives a shit, they changed something that the community wanted to change. Looking into some deep rhetorical analysis to attempt to make them look bad even though they literally do what the community wanted them to do is going to lead you nowhere here.
---
Only play wvw and you get free hero points. I can buy with my wvw token more than 2k hero points. Enough for all characters. The first day of PoF release i had all specs
---
A less toxic community would be enough :D
---
F
---
I'm a casual who you lost after you tried to justify camp 2.
---
Did T1-3 fractals discourage me from playing T4, even though I've seen the boss and heard the dialogue? Hell no. Did T1-3 teach me the basic mechanics of fractals? Definitely.
---
Many of us *want* to raid but we'll be damned if you think we have the time and scheduling availability to pencil in an organised training group.
---
I learned how to do T4s by pugging T1-3. If I could learn to raid by pugging I'd play raids, but I can't, so I won't.
---
Strike missions are a nice compromise but ultimately it'll remain to be seen whether it's enough to make a casual like me raid.
---
Sounds like a good idea to me, as long as Strike missions take less time to develop than a raidwing
---
Please, go on...
---
They haven't even shared any details yet and there's posts like these drawing conclusions.
---
Same goes for bounties, they are fun as long as you have a small decent group
---
Then, please, do something to make it better.
---
My only objective was to establish that it's a problem, not to make it better -- I don't have that ability.
---
We HAVENT BEEN ABLE to discuss real criticism on the game for years due to a portion of the community refusing to discuss or allow discussion unless it festers for months to years.
---
I'm sorry you dont grasp this but every issue that we have now was an issue months ago. They were discussed with many constructive posts. The responses here were typically "this game isnt for you, go play something else, oh by the way raiders are fucking toxic".
---
That's how the community was towards valid criticism. People becoming bitter while quitting is a natural response.
---
Too many armchair CEOs in this sub thinking they know how to run a company or a project. It‚Äôs pathetic.
---
It comes in waves because criticism is buried by whiteknights and casuals that dont want to read about issues with other gamemodes.
---
Until they cant bury it because enough people are done with the sad state of the game. 
---
That makes it very very back and forth. Many people have criticism but unless they bond together it cant be heard. That is also why broadly hating anet or these whiteknights is more likely to see the light of day than actual criticism on a less popular gamemode.
---
That's the same in every game. Not English or not English speaker ? Then fuck your feedback. And I would say that case of English speaker community getting more attention is way more spread than Japanese community getting more attention.
---
You'd ask instead? What the fuck has everybody been doing for months up until now? We are ALWAYS asking and NEVER getting any information. 
---
Like I said legitimately  dumb, cry ad-hominem all you want won't change the fact that you fail to grasp extremely basic concepts and know very little about the situation for somebody supposedly not stupid.
---
Yeah you're right. I also don't want her to die. I rather want her to be a strong hotheaded badass that looks for any opportunity to fight.
---
&gt;With a studio size of 300-400 managing one game for 7 years? Idk what to say.
---
Except until the recent layoffs, the studio wasn't just managing one game at all. Short memory? They had at least two projects with GW2 on a token staff to work on LW releases.
---
&gt;Contrary to what people believe, games focussed on "hardcore" top end players still have vastly more casuals than gw2. Because they go to flourishing games either way, as a benefit of having an active and thriving community and game.
---
And yet, League of Legends is more popular than Dota 2. Fortnite is more popular than Apex Legends &amp; PUBG.
---
I hate to break it to you, but this lie you keep telling yourself that the "hardcore" matters is very much that, a lie.
---
I always upvote Club Elona.
---
I dont agree and i dont like the way you paint black and white. Maybe you live in a simpler world

&gt;Are corporations people? The U.S. Supreme Court says they are, at least for some purposes. And in the past four years, the high court has dramatically expanded corporate rights.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood#In_the_United_States
---
&gt;As a matter of interpretation of the word "person" in the Fourteenth Amendment, U.S. courts have extended certain constitutional protections to corporations. The basis for allowing corporations to assert such protections under the U.S. Constitution is that they are organizations of people, and the people should not be deprived of their constitutional rights when they act collectively.[citation needed] Thus, treating corporations as having legal rights allows corporations to sue and to be sued, provides a single entity for easier taxation and regulation, simplifies complex transactions that would otherwise involve, in the case of large corporations, thousands of people, and protects the individual rights of the shareholders as well as the right of association.

&gt; Marketers do a great job of trying to humanise companies and make people forget they‚Äôre all about making money.
---
And that's why it looks like they aren't talking with the community - they do but in the own corporate way where there's no place for criticism, admitting mistakes because that hurts the image and profits. There's only "*excitement*" about every little shit (see the recent video from theater, the last one with chef 500 upgrade and pay attention to the wording used) no matter what smoke raises in the background.
---
Do not expect they ever talk with us like normal people because they only seem to be between 9 to 5; during that time they're just the personifications of the arena.net company (and in fact, that applies to any company or corporation) who are obligated to follow certain protocol and image.
---
Of course they tried to be more humane but that backfired because of how community behaved and still behaves here, in open and less moderated space - flooding them with all sorts of questions, irrelevant issues. Thus, AMA were moved at their own place where "discussion" can be controlled.
---
Sorry it took so long to reply , but i would like to clarify that this comment is not meant to be sarcastic at all . Im a relatively new player (450ish hrs in) and ive just received a whole expansion for free . Thats pretty much what i took away from the announcement , so im quite over the moon and having a blast :3
---
Lmao you don't have 35k Hp it's your fault there
---
May I ask why your angry? is it because people expected new expansion and only go living world episodic content?
---
Idk why, but Braham's pickup line popped into my head "Lets forge some legends together".

Sure did!

Well... r/factorio. Their devs are just on the next fucking level of awesomeness. New global update with very many changes? It will be experimental (aka beta) until we fix all the reported bugs (even though it is extremely playable from the start, I didn't encounter a single bug ever), until then we will fucking do everything we can with big bug fix patches every day or even twice a day, not forgetting about smaller gameplay updates to make the game better. Only 26 reported bugs after 66 patches? Nah, too much, still unstable. You have an idea? Post it to their forum or reddit, they will read it and very likely respond and discuss with other devs. People want to know about working process? Let's make Friday Facts where we describe our thoughts, what we are planning to do, what are devs doing and other funny stories EVERY FRIDAY FOR SIX FUCKING YEARS WITHOUT EVER SKIPPING THEM. Somebody doesn't want to buy a game and waits for sale? Sorry for you, we are certain in our price and respect feels of those who already bought the game, so we will not put the game on sale ever, even though it could be a nice advertising. If you think the price is too high, then don't buy it, we will work hard to improve the gameplay and reassure you that it's worth its money (and since 10000+ hours aren't rare here, it really is). Also we have free demo. Some quality-of-life mod is really popular? Let's think about adding this feature in vanilla game. Some mod has bug because of the way our code works? We'll rewrite OUR code and the bug will be fixed. And much, much more. I'm truly amazed.

Sure you will, I already opened account last night ;-)
---
&gt; Part of the problem is that the first 3.5 years of this game was pretty damned easy
---
Not entirely but mostly. Dungeons were pretty damn hard on release in which many, myself included didn't even do Arah for a very long time. Until they nerfed it since the community complained that they were too hard.
---
But yeah, this is a game for casuals. Hardcore or competitive players have something to do as well but they release content for their main audience.
---
In the end, we will have to see how ArenaNet reacts from all those things and going forward. If they are prioritizing the majority of the population and not add some resources to the more Hardcore players or the competitive side then the best thing is to look for a different game.
---
Which profession you picked? :)
---
&gt; And you show off around among your friends and play happily with it
---
All of my friends left shortly after PoF turned gw2 into a mediocre single player game with coop elements...
---
16K HOURS? I'm already getting dizzy, being the completenist I am.
---
I've always learned that independent of whose fault it **was**, outwards-facing the blame is taken on by the manager because well, it was their job to manage and clearly that hasn't worked out.
---
Nowadays managers frequently do it the other way around though, pocket cash but shift blame and layoffs onto the developers.
---
Yeah, some of us come here for the story and open world stuff for a little while, but WvW, PvP and Raids is what keeps the community going for the most part. You can't constantly hemorrhage veterans and expect to have a healthy MMO game. Personally if I wanted to play a story driven RPG game I'd play something like Fire Emblem and not waste my time here.
---
Yes, it was not the super hype-igniting announcment of the century but for my part, i am happy and excited for the next chapter and the days to come. Build-Templates are on their way, i like the personal story very much so far and i like the idea - as the trailer MIGHT suggest, that Jormag MIGHT start a mind-battle with our charakter throughout the next season. But if Jormag reawakened, so i bet, dit Primordus.
---
English is pretty much the de facto language of the world. Japanese is almost primarily spoken only in Japan. I wouldn't consider it the same.
---
Will it hurt the experience if I'll get expansions now? make the game too complex? or it's build gradually anyhow?
---
Anet does comment on changes in update notes but what they aren't doing is admitting that reddid community exists and it matters.
---
This is the saddest copepost in the history of the internet. You sound like a battered wife.
---
Nice name.
---
I actually came to gW2 because of that specific reason. WoW "took" so many forced hours. Raids on specific days, wipes, etc etc. I wanted a MMO I can play as a fresh father.
---
The sagas might also genuinely be able to deliver expansion level content and both us and they will see that this formula works better or just as good as expansions.
---
The issue is... we don't know, because we were not told. I'm on board with LS being the ultimate content delivery - but it needs to bring new features, new elite specs and less formulaic maps that have the same  basic concept over and over and over again. The only issue with the announcement was that these things were not discussed and we didn't get any new tangible info beyond where the story takes us.
---
yep, bestiary was bad and so was synth. BUT they recognized it and listened to the feedback. and holy shit, legion was a great league
---
As long as we get back the old LA design, I'm ok with it :D
---
Anet blames threat messages and insults, but people like you are acting as if their response also includes actual feedbacks.
---
I think it's completely fine to trash talk a company.
---
It's when you start mentioning names and starts to target specific people it's not ok.
---
Unfortunately, they did announce wvw-updates that are far from ready ("we will talk about that in a few months"), so if elite specs are planned but far from ready, they would probably still have mentioned them, unless they want to keep them a secret for whatever reason.
---
who uses windows8 anyway?
---
dude stop being so toxic
---
I'm on the group that believes most people is driven by rewards. And nowadays just skins is not enough because people is constantly showered with shiny skins on the gemstore that ussually shine more than what you can get ingame.
---
I also believe most people prefer to act like a mob where simple or no organization is required. They prefer to beat punchbags with a gazillion hp and get their reward and then move on to the next punchbag.
---
Well, that's what toxicity does to you
---
That comes later, after we gather Zhaitan's surviving fleets to kill the DSD.
---
same for me, I appreciate I don't need to coordinate IRL with other to do something in a game, that's not fun. I just want to come home from work and play, I would stay at work if I wanted challenges and drama.
---
Is this the time to praise?
---
We really did not.
---
And here is what happens when you deliever:
---
 [https://clips.twitch.tv/BlindingWrongElkBCouch](https://clips.twitch.tv/BlindingWrongElkBCouch)
---
honestly i expected nothing from that show because i knew they wont announce a new raid or anything that is more then 3 hours of stoey and map every X months and yet i was disappointed.
---
People are mad because of a recent announcement. 
---
The game isn't bad, plus you can play for free and the x-packs are now tied into one purchase. 
---
So honestly, just give it a go and see how you feel. 
---
You lose nothing
---
it's the perfect MMO to play casually
---
A blast from the past! Happy return and welcome back to Guild ~~Wars~~ Dramas!
---
Yeah, I think the community overall has been repeatedly stating that "we need transparency and information." If you need time, that's fine, but tell us that. Give us a timeline of goals. The dates can be tentative. Most of the community would be fine with that or even less. A good idea I heard is have AMA's or Dev diaries.
---
The biggest, most hype thing Anet could do for GW2 is just give us multiclassing where we can take ANY core traitline from ANY class in the place of an elite spec.  This would be an expansion level mechanic with endless experimentation options for players to try.
---
  
---
Plus, balance is already whack.  It is also addressed extremely slowly, so why don't we just throw it out the window at this point and go for the fun option that respects GW1 (which had multiclassing).
---
Mechanics:  
---
CORE Specializations of other classes count as your elite spec.  You cannot take the elite spec of the sub class.  
---
Gain the F skills and Resources of the subclass.  They are not as effective (you only have 1 traitline to draw power to the class).    
---
Example: Subclassing ranger would grant you pets.  They would have reduced hp, damage, and healing.
---
Subclassing Necromancer would grant you lifeforce and core death shroud.  Your lifeforce cap would be lower than a primary necro, and the skills do less damage and condition duration.  
---
Traits in either line that modify F skills work on both classes, unless it is LITERALLY unable.  Traits that modify the same category of weapon or skill function normally.  
---
Example:  Warrior's Shout trait would stack with Guardian's Shout Trait.  
---
Gain access to weapons and utilities based on the traitline, not the class itself, they function normally unless the weapon is shared.  If the weapon is shared between classes, use the primary class weapon skills, but apply weapon traits from the subclass normally (if it would function).  Recharge reduction stacks multiplicatively, not additively.   
---
Example:  Right Hand Strength (guardian trait) would work on everyone's one handed main hand weapon, but the sword recharge would only work with swords still.    
---
We could have collections/content designed around learning cross-class skills.  
---
You could spend PVP/WVW currency to unlock them faster like hero points.  
---
There's just so many interesting possibilities if they could bring back subclassing.
---
not anymore

Maintaining a professional demeanor (or at least refraining from calling people "ass hats" and whatnot) isn't really that hard to do.
---
gw2 is a wonderful single player game for casuals who cannot commit too much but love world exploration and collecting stuff. AND IT'S THE BEST THING EVER.
---
this is the only game which made this kind of gameplay and it's wonderful.
---
you are saying like it's a bad thing but it is not
---
Actually that's supposed to be Historian Fia, who gets you looking for gorillas in Orr :p
---
We should really make that announcement that only people who have 35k+ AP 200 duhm kp 4500+WvW rank, 10h+ of Lore speculation, 10k+h oh gameplay and a sub :29 time in the "jormarg's fang" beetle race, are welcome to post here, more visible.
---
Speaking of this: since you posed as a reply can I see your 10h+ lore speculation videos, just to be sure you are a legit poster and not one of them casuals?
---
people hated hot. dont' you remember ? that's why pof was so easy copared to hot.
---
hot was bad for the game. many left it and that's why it was heavy nerfed.
---
Walls are suggestions.
---
The game changed through time, it wasnt like this from the start which is why a lot of people are bitter about it. If it was always like this, these people would have never invested into it to begin with. Change is not necessarily a bad thing but there is always collateral, customers in this case.
---
PoF was also not delivering Paragons or Dervishes. That's something to remember.
---
You can get thousands of hours of enterainment from anything you enjoy, the fact that you are willing to give money to support it is not the same as giving money to **get more** of it.
---
That aside, what is nothing to you in terms of money may not be the same for another one, take that into account.
---
I for myself will gladly pay for content, but won't ever pay for predatory marketing schemes like loot boxes (black lion chests) which are the main source of revenue for anet at the moment.
---
I love and have always loved guild wars, and watching it take this turn of small content releases with revenue solely on cash goods is saddening.
---
Nah, ANet is actually really good at creating engaging but still clear tells in raids. Open world is where it's shit. In bounties it happens so often that you die out of nowhere, and for all the instabilities you just have to constantly look at the buff bar. 
---
Im very sceptical about strikes (unless they're instanced, hard enough and have a hardmode), but tells are not going to be the problem. W7, freezie and the dragon bash arena all had perfectly fine tells and telegraphs. It's just open world, dungeons and trash filled fractals where they suck tremendously.
---
Your post can be summed up with one sentence "it's better to do nothing than making mistakes". I can't agree with this.
---
It needs punishing mechanics, or it'll completely miss the mark as an introduction to raids.
---
See your title, insta downvoted. There is absolutely no reason to not get new elite specs since it‚Äôs the only thing that could satisfy pve / pvp / wvw players, aka everyone, for a long time.
---
And if they have a hardmode and are actually engaging enough to replay.
---
Was gonna make a remark exactly like this xD
---
You claim these are casual games yet both pump money into competition and their more dedicated scenes. Anet does the direct opposite.
---
You can say league is more casual friendly than Dota from how the game is designed, but which part of it caters to casuals first and foremost? Not the balance. Not the riot supported content. Not the novel champions or the redesign of mechanics. All of it geared towards competition or high end first, rather than the bulk of their playerbase.
---
What they cater towards casuals is their skins and gemstore. More lux, ahri and yasuo skins to sell to casuals.
---
Leagues esport scene was at a deficit for years yet the investment paid off. 
---
You can say gw2 is awful to watch, fair enough. At this point it's awful unless you really like 111111 and has next to no marketing from players, content or anet. Growth? xD
---
You're basically new player, since you dropped the game early. For you, the veteran frustration doesn't apply. You can safely come back and play the game without worrying much. There are at least 18-24 months of progression and fun before you.
---
They should have had an AmA after the reveal tbh.. it would have caused less confusion about other personal statements. Besides that the dev actually clearified / explained why she said what she said so people should rest it.
---
The raid like fractals are by far the best 5 man content in the game though. They're actively going away from fractals being an introduction to raids by not making any new CMs and filling the new ones with boring and badly telegraphed trash.
---
You figured out today that gw2 does not have vertical gear progression?... I don't even know what to say‚Ä¶ it's not like this has been one of the main selling points of the game or something...
---
Just tell pugs you don‚Äôt run pack and you will be fine with them on your Chrono.
---
They'd have to be harder than freezie and actually require a healer to be a good introduction to raids. An encounter like freezie where you can basically afk stand in most mechanics won't be a good introduction to raids.
---
I would say it is definitely on the table. Probably not with the start of it though. Especially because there are still some older specs that still need rework and some tweaks to bring them on par with the rest, plus their philosophy of trade offs. That is definitely needed to finish before we can get another ones.
---
They aren't internalizing criticism dude, people are allowed to talk about other things while the team works on a response. The idea that someone should have to sit down and shut up about the abuse they're receiving until the rest of the team finalizes a response is frankly fucking disgusting.
---
Repurposing mechanics isn't bad, but the release time for raids is already abysmal.
---
Rytlock didn‚Äôt ‚Äúneglect‚Äù his cubs. That‚Äôs how charr society works. Parents never contact their cubs
---
Because this is a sensitive subject, better no touch it at all.
---
To me the instabilities ruin any fun they could have been.
---
That's my take away from what Chris Wilson has said. They are investors looking for a return nothing more.
---
I disagree with #1. They should have enrage timers, but they should be comparatively looser time constraints than raids. Letting people take 30 minutes doesn't force them to learn or change anything.  
---
I agree with "**Make positioning &amp; mechanics matter** ", but I disagree with the paragraph that follows. The way to teach people and to make positioning and mechanics matter is to make sure *everyone* has to do them, but to make it better for learning, make failing the mechanics less punishing. Just punishing enough that a given player can fuck it up a couple times and still live/not wipe the group, but punishing enough that continuing to fuck it up over a fight will get you killed or the run failed. If only a couple people have to worry about it, it's too easy to just not be the one who has to worry about them every time. It just teaches people that they can just let others handle the mechanics while they braindead dps.
---
I am aware of this, though Bangar's statement implies that.
---
Buying maps is a pain due to map hoarders, that buy out all the maps they can, relist them and refuse to sell them to anyone unless you buy them all at once from them.
---
I just moved back to Win7 after trying to install latest Win10 feature update. It messed up everything, deleted many files and programs (glad I did backup before) and after a few boots, it simply stopped working. Win10 is the most inconvenienced OS ever witnessed, meanwhile Win7 stays quiet and keeps going without a single problem.
---
The las Living story Season has added tons of weapon and armor skins, much more than we used to get.
---
&gt;a LOT of frustration will hit PvP and WvW
---
You completely misjudge the willingness for WvW and PvP players to accept poor balance in exchange for new and interesting ways to play their game. "Game Balance" in WvW is not a real thing, there will always be something most powerful and people will run that. 
---
Check with the community and ask them: would you rather play scourge + firebrand meta for another 2 years? Or would you like to play something different, something perhaps also as broken? I think you will find that people are tired of the staleness more than the brokenness. HoT had broken specialisations as well and people were more satisfied at the end because the meta shifted and evolved; PoF has not because the changes have been minor and not enough to shake up the Scourge/FB combo.
---
Well, it's a pretty good think that GW2 focuses on story and casual stuff, because that's why people pick GW in the first place (although it was also for PvP in GW1).
---
It was never good at "hardcore" PvE, and hardcore players already had much better MMOs to pick in that domain so they never came to GW2.
---
If you want to play endgame with friendly people, its a wrong game. The community calls itself the most friendlt because everyone plays solo.
---
It's worth pointing out that a big old post about not being toxic in your responses to DEVs got a lot of toxic responses. The people that leave those are the ones that won't listen.
---
The best bet in any scenario is to ignore them entirely and only bother to respond to the more constructive criticism. There's literally no point engaging with them, they won't feel guilty for their statements. The community that have criticisms but weren't toxic just feel even more ignored if the only official response is to the toxic ones, if anything that's going to embolden the toxic replies even more.
---
honestly if there could be a one day timeout for everyone in this subreddit, because im getting tired of seeing the same shit ever since, people in this subreddit has said more than enough but until this day this subreddit is still on fire smh
---
&gt;You claim these are casual games yet both pump money into competition and their more dedicated scenes. Anet does the direct opposite.
---
Overwatch pumps large amounts of money into it's league too (and pre-emptively tried to milk it back in typical ATV-B fashion), but is an incredibly casual game. eSports is easy marketing when it works, but yet again as Overwatch demonstrates, simply pumping money into a scene isn't enough to make it successful.
---
&gt;You can say league is more casual friendly than Dota from how the game is designed, but which part of it caters to casuals first and foremost? Not the balance. Not the riot supported content. Not the novel champions or the redesign of mechanics. All of it geared towards competition or high end first, rather than the bulk of their playerbase.
---
No denies, TPs, couriers. No heroes like Meepo, Invoker, Chen, etc. The list only goes on. LoL also very much does take a "balance around L2P" in contrast to IceFrog's approach in Dota.
---
&gt;You can say gw2 is awful to watch, fair enough. At this point it's awful unless you really like 111111 and has next to no marketing from players, content or anet. Growth? xD
---
No marketing? ArenaNet tried to push eSports during the height of the heymetoo-eSports-scene fad in the industry with that ESL deal. But it fell flat because GW2 is intrinsically boring to watch. More updates or balancing isn't going to change that.
---
Which isn't really surprising, pretty much all of the attempts to artificially grow a scene have fallen flat, because first and foremost you need watchability for a game to catch on. GW2 has none.
---
Episode 2 will share map with episode 1, that should cut some development time

Kick off the mission by talking with the recovered spirit of Traherne at the pale tree.  He'll also introduce you to the Riftwalker, the new Necromancer elite spec with a mobility focus and a short, untargetable shroud.

Welcome back! Was already missing it at the start of my working week, Cheers!
---
Actually if u go to wow retail now, it feels like a mobile game. Everything is so streamlined as if pressing the "autoplay" key. I wouldnt go there for anything. 
---
Warframe is good if u like grinding and probably the best gameplay in the mmo market but it revolves around grind.
---
Asian MMOs are mostly about PvP and PvP there is P2W. BDO especially is designed for whales.
---
ESO is okay, content is coming at a decent pace but it never stuck with me.
---
Atm the superb MMOS for me are warframe and FF. They release amazing content on a very strict basis, even did massive overhauls to the engine and UI and gameplay.
---
Comaping anything to PoE is unfair. They are just on another level.
---
But yeah, they are one of the good guys.
---
Yep, the collection bit is great for me and it's really what each chapter update provides in length. Haven't had a problem with what I can/can't do or ANet's support and involvement or the size of the updates. Honestly confused about much of the criticism, because the game does have many facets to what/how you can play. I get that some areas are lacking, but I'm always seeing updates to some kind. I'll admit I'm 85%+ PvE player, I'm a sucker for story and the history of this game, but it is an MMORPG after all, you have to be interested in it somewhat and it should be their primary focus.
---
a lot
---
lol look at this, even a new player is hesitant to play the game after visiting this subreddit
---
Add a golemancer engi in golem suit with staff or GS and I'm sold!
---
That's why we need to rebuilt Ascalon and the Northern Wall, and purge all Charr.
---
&gt; But again, importantly that's really not on any individual dev - or even "the devs", as a whole - to fix, or not interact with Twitter/whatever over. The only blame lies with management not immediately making people get a handle on it right after the announcement, when the situation was instable and it could have gone either way depending on how fast the company can move. Their speed turned out to be 'Not‚Ñ¢', and that is the real (and only) problem, tbh.
---
agreed, at is core it's a top management issue (and to be fair, they should have seen it coming that the anouncement would be seen as lackluster)
---
Because OW is NOT properly balanced around its competitive level. It's high end gameplay was figured out and remained largely unchanged for years. Consequently most hardcore and competitive players left OW for other games even if they liked the playstyle initially.
---
Same for gw2. You cant throw money at esports like an idiot expecting returns. Your game needs to be FUN to play dedicated. Exact same for HS which is the epitome of a casual game that had competition but never balanced or catered towards high end.
---
*cough* Whoops. I knew that.
---
That's the point of calling everyone toxic, make people turn on one another to distract them from never getting answers to the criticism.
---
it does, a bit north of the ice wall
---
&gt;  I am still not a raider, because the barriers to raid entry are too high
---
Stop making excuses. If you know your rotation, and are geared correctly then you're ready. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6kzoyy/eu_the_crossroads_inn_raid_training_tuethusat/
---
Yeah.. I wanted to post something funny but uhh. I don‚Äôt think people liked this at all.
---
Oh it will 100% happen.
---
Raids take min 10 months to release and usually have 3 bosses. 
---
If they release 1 strike per episode, 3 bosses will take 9-12 months.
---
There is just no way they are going to work on strikes and raids at the same time, that would be the double number of bosses they have to make in the same amount of time.
---
Honestly? You shouldn't. 
---
It's a game if you are not having fun anymore by playing it like it seems you should just quit and play another game.
---
so they haven't improved their system since at least the HoT announcement at all. great. good thing they included a selection this time, so second time receivers still get something out of ANets issues.
---
Where is my housing then! I cannont even sit on a chair.
---
But there are casual players like me who want instanced content. Fractals and dungeons is most of the stuff I do when log in. I want to play with others. I just feel like this is not an mmo. Everyone just plays alongside each otther, not with each other when it comes to most open world content.
---
opposing that, The air is a lie!
---
Darn invisi walls
---
yes. THANK YOU! I whole heartedly agree. gw2's PVE is **all about** having that... quiet mini-adventure. Going on a short quest with your friends and complaining that you can't find the objective. Trading away that random sword to your bestie who uses it WAY too long out of attachment.
---
But I agree with the complainers that there are parts of the game that need just.... BASIC attention, even as a PVE focused player, I wish they'de go back and fix GLARING issues and problems with the core dungeons, and polish the core story's missions, those cut away cinematic are WAY over used in the 1-80 story quests, and it wouldn't be hard to simply take those voice files, and add in some "in-game" dialogue bubbles. it would cost man power, yes, but not much asset creation.
---
In terms of PVE, I still STRONGLY disagree with Anet adding fractals and raids. primarily because of the addition of ascended and legendary armors &amp; trinkets. Anet promised a lack of gear grind, then patched it in anyway.
---
I love the way they implemented legendary crafting and even legendary trinkets, though. a HUGE series of extremely difficult collections for legendary armor would be nice, because I'm never running a raid.... ever.
---
Strikes will replace raids, they already take 10 months minimum to release 3 bosses. So now if anet will make 1 strike per episode, thats 9-12 months for 3 bosses. 
---
No way in hell anet is going to suddenly work on 6 bosses, and many new instances at the same tiime.
---
If I'm not mistaken it's not a bug, but an intended feature.
---
Heh. Maybe. Eh, I see posting this wasn‚Äôt the best idea in the world. That‚Äôs alright. I was hoping it‚Äôd get a laugh out of people, no matter what side they‚Äôre on. 
---
Shame it didn‚Äôt work, I thought it was a little amusing.
---
But then people will just cry for nerfs, and never touch that content ever again.  Same will happen even if you can't fail them, but rewards are shit.
---
I did the hardcore rading in WoW and other MMO's (but mostly WoW) but today, I have zero interest in that, nor the time. So for me GW2 is the perfect causal game that I enjoy very much. It's not flawless, far from it, but its as near as a perfect MMO-experience I can get.
---
There is no raid boss that requires a certain dps to kill, for example Mirage might be the most effective DPS for Soulless Horror, but you could kill her with any other DPS as well
---
I don‚Äôt have any complaints about the content, only the format. There was too much song and dance for very little. 
---
While I‚Äôm excited about the upcoming prologue, they didn‚Äôt reveal an awful lot game-wise. Two of the announcements, build templates and whatever Swiss PvP is, we already knew were coming - but they still haven‚Äôt given us a date. Yet they announced a ton of merchandise.
---
You simply don't understand because you haven't even read GW2 Marketing Manager's Rubi latest tweets. She simply blames entire community for being toxic and doesn't add anything else either. She could've mentioned "we've recieved some insulting and harsh personal messages. It is disrespectful to threaten or verbally abuse developers. We've are working hard to improve our work and to clear things up for our great Guild Wars 2 community. Therefore I just want to inform everyone to respect each other...". There were many ways to do it, communicate with community, however, this particular person Rubi decided to flame community like a bratty child.
---
See you can kill the bosses mostly with whatever. 
---
But when you raid you first decide on what you play. Boon support heal or dps. When you choose dps it‚Äôs noones obligation to gear your dps Charakters. Gw2 has vertical progression and is *super alt friendly* you have power bosses and condi bosses. So you will *at least* need 2 sets of gear or depending on you class maybe another Charakter. Everyone else tweaks their build and aspires to contribute towards killing the boss. Why shouldn‚Äôt you?
---
And your example with dh is funny because it‚Äôs propably the best dps class to start raiding on- while later down the line you can just realism fb and have a condi class ready. You can play slb basically anywhere. But it‚Äôs okay to, as a raidlead, require you to practice your dps and eventually gear a p slb. As a lead you always have to consider the overall enjoyment of the group. Especially if it‚Äôs a practice run. I wasn‚Äôt there, but when I notice in my trainings are bad players who aren‚Äôt really interested in improving I‚Äôm not gonna tackle hard bosses because that will just kill their enjoyment and tilt every one. Same with dhuum wich i gave as an example. You need at the very least 4 ppl that know exactly what to do or a training there is just the first 2 minutes all over again and no one even gets to see the boss. That doesn‚Äôt sound fun right? If you have questions regarding gear, build, Charakters or how to acquire gear hit me up. But I advise talking to your raid lead In private befor venting on Reddit.
---
Why?   When I've played metas and other group content, I've \*always\* been open to map feedback.....
---
(and I've \*often\* fucked it up, and needed such feedback!!)   Especially for Queen's Pavilion group boss events!
---
I'm always open to feedback, and learning to do better.... eg: (for fucking hell dude, stop hitting that boss....turn your fucking pet off mother fucker!!!!!)
---
Such mistakes in open world get you roasted.  Equivalent mistakes in raids get you ignored.
---
Charr were playable long before FFXIV added Hrothgar. Outside of that you have various animal-eared humans.
---
And playing both, the bit about "GW is for people who like stories" is hilariously untrue. GW2 is comparable in depth to ARR and *wishes* to be as good as Heavensward or forbid Shadowbringers which both had incredible story and build up.
---
Tbh I‚Äôd argue what you said is true for every boss except sh and largos.
---
And they are supposed to scale to number of players in the group. I don't see anet going that route to require a healer. It would take them so much work to balance it for every combination of players in the group.
---
I don't remember any of my friends being upset that HoT was too hard though. I remember them being upset about class balance and other stuff.
---
It's one of those sites (cdkeys). Apparently they are in the middle of legit sellers and shady sites like g2a etc. 
---
Some search showed that they're usually scanning and selling regional copies. I'd normally be against that, but I live in Turkey so yeah I'm not gonna feel sad about buying from a cheap region :D
---
Ok you proved my point
---
I think this is what the majority of the community feels. Anet created too much hype in comparison to the content they revealed.
---
Nice circlejerk mate
---
Guild wars classic?
---
If EVERYONE, who is upset with the annoucement, took such advice to their hearts, I'm gonna tell you - the servers would be closed, and the game would be oficially dead within this year, and all those DontLikeDontPlay white knights would be crying, why their beloved game is banished to the Shadow Realm.
---
Have you thought of that? I guess not. 
---
I don't know what kind of outcome sirs DontLikeDonPlay expect from their crusade; maybe they don't want to hear all this negativity, but you don't need a crusade to use mute button, and to skip reddit posts about things they would not like to hear.   
---
What I'm sure of, they are adding fuel to the fire.
---
I do understand your point - you don't roll in a cow pie, complaining how smelly it is, but this is different. People bought the game. Bought expansions. Bought gems even. They are customers. They invested themselves in the game. They are the main source of income for Anet. 
---
They shall speak, and they shall be heard.
---
I was thinking more along the lines of the gold to gems conversion since they're relatively cheap iirc, but fair enough lol
---
They have made some open world maps, they probably will release more but as a whole ye it is 95% instanced. But they game itself is just so fast and dynamic that it blows you away, at first at least. Sliding, double jumping, walking on walls, spin spin spin etc. What i appreciate most about it is that they dont hesitate to make UI,combat and engine changes, if that's what it takes. Those devs have some major balls.
---
Collections bore me to tears. Probably why I barely play anymore.
---
I am not familiar with that HABBO HOTEL, but I agree that the game's combat is AMAZING, but it gets wasted as they have almost abandoned PvP, WvW, with raids and fractals getting little attention and they are focusing so damn much on casual PvE.
---
&gt; No staff
---
Inquest Tuning Rod would look awesome on engi though. Just like Greatsaw would fit engi well if it used GS.
---
Honestly, I think that having a pool of primary weapon skills would be a balance nightmare that would end with 5 viable and the rest forgotten.
---
GGG is one of the BEST for communicating with players.
---
at least skills mattered and it had more depth than gw2 ( so many non combat activities), fuck.. at this point even runescape does. I agree tho, the pw2 pushed me away... and the combat .
---
Neither run leadership runes. IF you are healing you go monk and if you are dps boon you go the scholar/dps runes like thief, eagle or even flamelegion(with dhs, fb and/ or ele you usally have burning) or even rune of ogre. 
---
In fractals you usually max out precision really easy with [omnipotion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinite_Mist_Omnipotion) so you want additional fury and ferocity. 
---
I guess it could work if you go mostly berserkers with a alac/boon rev. In the end you wont loose too much dps if you really want to use the runes. I still reccomend the %dmg runes though.
---
I'll be honest, if your guild's raid training doesn't accept your sb dps or doesn't want to show you the harder bosses because of a "they'll never beat it anyway"-type mentality, you should change raid training group.
---
you're probably right but it doesn't change op's point
---
This sounds right to me. I'd argue they would move up from Ice Cliff Chasms to Jaga Moraine -- maybe we will deal with the Eye of the North, or Gunrar's Hold.
---
I miss those leaks. They certainly kept me tight with the game, because they gave me something exciting to think about. A reason to play and invest in the game.
---
But now, Anet, AFAIK, is almost leakproof. Pity they don't know how to read the air; perhaps, if they leaked something exciting, something people want, hinting that it will be added to the game in the future, all this fire would be put out, or diminished at the very least.
---
Yeah, but I very much hope that they don't just take reddit into account. According to reddit, this game is pretty much unplayable in every game mode except open world. It's so much bullshit to filter through.
---
I have few golds as well. I am poor in game and in real life.
---
I play content with people constantly. That's open world and instanced. If you think you can't play content together because it's not "hard" I don't know what to tell you.
---
But those open world maps are still instanced to your party, which is exactly like gw1 was.  You can't just bump into random strangers on them.
---
'We don't want to silence you but we want to bury all the criticism in one thread where it probably won't be seen and pretend that everything is ok again" = bad. Don't worry though, Anet will approve. It's exactly what they do!! GG!!
---
Finally. Now I can enjoy players posting their first world completion and legendaries again.
---
I was more thinking about the Miqo'te and now the Viera which are more how I view the "furry" style (mostly anthropomorphic), instead of Charr/Hrothgar which are just playing beasts like Worgens or Taurens of WoW.
---
About the story FFXIV is great indeed and arguably better than GW2's, but it's mostly appealing to the Final fantasy fans (both in lore and narrative style). GW2's storyrelling is better than FFXIV's since season 2 IMO, when I play FFXIV, I mostly have huge camera-locked pages of written dialogue, while in GW2 it's gameplay integrated voice acting.
---
GW2 style is closer to a single player game, you just follow the flow and live the story. Final fantasy is text for the most part, like the typical FF style.
---
&gt; I wish Warframe had good devs, they outsource a lot of their code to  India for updates. Hence why every update tends to break the game. 
---
May we get a trustworthy source supporting that?
---
If its only casual, fun, and chill I need more chill casual fun  stuff to do like other games offer like : 
---
more dances, emotes, duels, fist-fight, marriage/family-system, housing, building and better decorate system, more activity-like mini games, dice, beer pong, cards, guild activites, two-people mounts, way to carry other player (with permission ofc) screenshot-mode to the game (better camera control), fishing, farming, ways to interract with mini,  etc etc.
---
This storm will pass in a few days, people have already calmed down and it shows in the newer posts as people come to terms of what GW2 was a few years back and what it is now. I bet mods will get downright bored after spending the last days in a supercharged subreddit with new thread every single minute and hundreds of posts withing a few minutes :)
---
Since this effect isn't a UI effect I don't see how its absence would lead to a cleaner UI. I don't think the effect is incredible helpful or even noticeable, since chances are when swapping build you well have some sort of build management window up that might even block you from seeing your toon (if you position it at the Center of the screen). 
---
tl;dr: I don't think the animation is an issue or a perk, it jsut doesnt matter much.
---
I'd like to have some confirmation of build changing, like a "ding" sound when you unlock a trait or skill. They chose level up animation and sound, which is probably the worst possible choice they could make.
---
Is there any reason not to spend an 80 boost (or one of my 5 x 60 level boosts from birthdays), and just play exactly as I would have anyway, but with more freedom?
---
The one and only tell in W7 I can't properly figure out is when Q2 does the knockback after jumping on a pylon.
---
Tf am I supposed to look out for? Atm I'm just counting down from 3 and hope for the best
---
You've been listening to Andrew Yang, haven't you?
---
... Me too
---
I havent played them long but i went inside solo and i found other players going around killing stuff. I think it's the same format as gw2 maps, each map holds about 20 player, maybe im wrong.
---
This is my point of view on GW2, this is a game where you fix your own objectives and this is what give you a sense of pride. Because you achieve what you wanted too. Guild Wars 2 is about freedom and exploration, trying to achieve what others didn‚Äôt yet. 
---
WoW or FF14 are games that push you do to something. You have only one real objective get better Gear. 
---
This is not Guild Wars 2. Because Guild Wars 2 can be for Hardcore gamers too they just have to fix objectives that stick to their play time. 
---
This is what was extraordinary with GW2 at the launch of the game, legendary weapons were extremely rare and the first player had to find the way to craft them. 
---
This is what Anet need to bring back, mystery, secret that push the community forward. To me the fact that few players got some super rare things is super nice because it push the ones that saw them to try to get those weapons or armors. 
---
Anet did it at PoF with the griffon but they should do it more frequently in every aspect of the game and with every piece of gear you can equip
---
Okay bud keep telling me how I feel. If there was a T1-3 style intro to raiding I'd do it. But sure keep making up reasons why the *majority of the playerbase* don't raid, you're the expert.
---
This would have made the best easter egg for PoF
---
Anet lost the chance to incorporate a tool to their stack by regulating its use and limiting it to big events by having the dev, who won't be releasing the tool anyway, sign a contract. There is no other reason than pride to not have hired the guy, or at least worked out a one time deal for the code.
---
Sorry but what??
---
Raids aren‚Äôt unforgiving. They aren‚Äôt hard.
---
Yea they are not face roll content which you can do with your full 10 man heal tank gear and pressing 1. But if you gather 100 ppl of them for an bounty in PoF the bounty would be as hard and fail.
---
Raids are kinda in a situation as Dungeons in the beginning or as hard as T4 Fractals just as 10 man content. Yea it‚Äôs difficult to gather 10 sane minded ppl then just 5. But people who really want to do that content can do it. There are so many build and such viable at the moment that everybody should find a way he/she like to play. Do it a Little Bit in Open world in Fractals and then join a training guild. And you will get your raid experience with some full wing clears. You just get used to the mechanic same as you need to learn new story mechanic or open world boss mechanic. Many of you now them so you can do it in raids as well. 
---
The enrage timer in raids is just a joke except when ppl play with bad stats on their gear. And yea some encounter are more difficult. But when you get used to the mechanic are easier encounter they get easier as well. Furthermore, killing ValeGuardian (1st every released Raid boss) was such a great feeling. Getting something you worked your ass up as a team was great!
---
i dont think its like that at all.
---
ff14 trials = gw2 strike missions
---
ff14 raids = gw2 raids
---
ff14 hunts = gw2 bounties
---
ff14 allince raids = n/a
---
You probably just went in with matchmaker set to public. If you are set to public, you will get put into a group that can hold max of 4 people, and if you don't get put into a group with anyone.  Up to 3 people will be able to join your instance.
---
GW2 is a good game. It is Anet with whom players are upset with; lack of communication, focusing on the trollest of trolls, ignoring real criticism, releasing a 1-2h of something fresh to play every 3rd month circa. 
---
Starting as a new player, you have lots stuff to do. It, certainly, hooks up people, or have high chances to do at the least. Character creation itself gives you multiple options how will you go through the story up to 35 level, where the story is the same for all, regardless of their character creation choices.
---
And then, there are expansions, that have different paths to the same ending, depending on your choices, and gives a little of different experience if you play specific race; like playing Sylvari, for example, during Heart of Thorns will give you different feeling, than if you played a Charr, for example. 
---
You're a minority here, yes; as long as you avoid "don't like - don't play" dogma, which makes things much worse, and adds tension to the aftermatch.
---
He's an overly simplified charr :D
---
It's less about giving up and more about I simply lack the time and/or consistent schedule to bother with it. But of course, the couple hostile experiences I dealt with has a minor effect that resides. I'd love to do the raids, but I can't sit down and go "I have X amount of free time, every week on this day to do it." I'm cautious about seeking out or joining a raid focused guild as that is hardly my focus or want of focus for GW2, when I'm ingame I tend to pick a goal and work on it, and sometimes that goal changes.
---
Because it seems that your question has already been answered , i just wanted to add this : keep an eye out for a living world sale soon , there was recently a tweet deleted by anet that advertised this sale . I anticipate this sale to drop in the next 1 to 2 weeks :3 hype
---
Mount licensing. what where the ods of getting the one you wanted again? was is mathematical better to buy the 200‚Ç¨ bundle? hmmmmm
---
And a key thing to note is nobody should be saying they go "above and beyond," they're just being good people and getting the producer-consumer relationship right.
---
The majority dont raid because they're not interested. When raids first came into the game there were no barriers, people were going in with green random gear without a clue and just wiped for hours upon hours. Still most playerbase didn't participate because they weren't interested, even without kp and training groups and li and all that stuff.
---
I speak based on experience of raiding for years, not talking out of my ass, i was leading training runs on a regular basis through lfg, i've been a part of many statics and although every person is different all raiders share some very specific qualities. 
---
1) They dont make excuses. If they wanna raid they dont wait from someone else to hold their hand.
---
2)They just pop a tag and make their own groups. You can do that at any time with no restrictions yet you CHOOSE not to do it.
---
3)They dont wanna experience the lore and maybe get a kill here and there. They're hungry for it,almost obsessed one could say.
---
4) Most people got there without difficulty progression, they accept it for what it is and either put the effort or just walk away. Again half-assed mentality is the worst thing in a raid environment.
---
These are 2 pair of shoes. In PoE all content is played by all players to an extend. The GGG post is about the amount of dailies you can get. It won't change any gameplay systems or reward structures.
---
True!  But staff would look soooo good for an inquest-centered elite spec.  And I have it on good authority that carrying big sticks is part of leadership. 
---
I do agree with you on the balancing, but my theoretical Guild Wars 2 adds new abilities to creatures to create varied environments where no single skill will be successful for long.  Centaurs, for example will trample you down and enemy Inquest now fortify areas.  Undead inflict disease and Charr use formation and tactics.  
---
Oh, and Norn attack you out of nowhere when you're north.  Price of being famous.
---
&gt;Boon support needs to be played with 100% accuracy / execution
---
That is so not true I'm actually floored that people think this.
---
You **don't** need to be perfect to complete raids. Whoever told you this is either a hardcore player who grinds almost 24/7, or someone who just doesn't know what they're talking about.
---
Mistakes are and will always be a thing, no matter what you do, unless you're in the top 0.000001%. You'll be absolutely fine if you're not a perfectionist, trust me.
---
&gt;And I still cannot quite comprehend how a healer player "targets" their heals in raids.
---
Well it depends on what healer you play. Assuming druid, you have AoE skills and point-and-click skills. There's really not much to it so no need to overthink things.
---
&gt;Even if I equip my druid with optimal gear, there is *no game mode* that teaches me how to use it, outside of raids.
---
There kinda is though, and that's open world. Seriously, you can just spam your skills, read the tooltips and learn it that way. It's really simple.
---
as if NCsoft is so much better xD
---
The ‚Äúend‚Äù beach of Siren‚Äôs reef, sky/jackal palace in desert highlands during night, some deeply branded zones in Jahai and Dragonfall, Tarir/generally whole Auric Basin, Strawberry patch in Diessa Plateau, Sea parts of Bloodtide coast...
---
Thank fuck people are finally starting to make these posts. Corporations are not people, and people acting on behalf of corporations are not people either. They are only a vessel to communicate between the corporation as a whole and the consumer.
---
If you reached out to customer support because there is a bug in the game, do you expect the customer support agent to fix your problem? No, you expect the company to.
---
To humanize corporations is to allow them to manipulate you through emotion.
---
They sell mount select licenses for 1200 gems if you want a specific mount. That's 15 USD.
---
I just wish that people learned to use vote buttons for using it based on relevancy to discussion, not based on if they agree or not.
---
&gt; Sorry but what?? Raids aren‚Äôt unforgiving. They aren‚Äôt hard.
---
Accept the fact that the vast majority does not feel that way.
---
I'd much prefer one pinned thread than pages of mixed reactions.
---
1. I would suggest getting level 80 exotics and a basic build once you hit 80. You can take your time on perfecting everything but just having proper gear will make a world of difference. [Metabattle](http://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) has open world builds and there are [other options for raids and fractals](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds).
---
2. S2 takes place before HoT so yes, you will be out of the loop on some of what is going on but most of the story is pretty self contained. Here are my [recommendations on the story](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Story) and basic overview. If you do decide to skip it (or want info on season 1) I wrote up a [quick summary](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Story_Recap) of the story (season 2 is just a TL;DR right now, I need to find the time to expand it)
---
3. Crafting will play a role in ascended crafting later on and is useful for leveling. Early on though it's mainly just a good way to get exp (~7 levels). When you do decide to level it I suggest taking a look at [this site](http://gw2crafts.net/).
---
4. Here is an [overview on rarity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Item#Rarity) but it's just white (basic) &lt; blue (fine) &lt; green (masterwork) &lt; yellow (rare) &lt; orange (exotic) &lt; pink (ascended) = purple (legendary). 
---
I wouldn't worry about the front page too much, there were a lot of expectations going into their "big announcement" and some people were let down by what little they showed for the next content. People really just want more info and a roadmap so we can get a better idea of what content is being worked on. The next section of content is a "Saga" that should take a while (maybe 6 months - 1 year?).
---
I'd prefer pages of honest discussion, not threads carefully picked to praise Anet but you do you.
---
Are the forums so bad that they remove anything that doesn't make the game look perfect?
---
something i just realized.. we can fight the drakkar dragon as worldboss.. but if you look at that esrly concept art it has nothing to do, with the dragon under the ice in gw1.. i really jope they go closer/back to the original
---
gw1: http://mikeabundo.com/2007/10/16/guild-wars-the-drakkar-lake-dragon/
---
gw2 early concept art https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Drakkar_concept_art.jpg
---
This is not an owl. But it could well be a spirit of the wild. I think in the announcement we were told that there would be some new spirits.
---
Re upset fans on this forum self-quote:
---
&gt;    Anet managed to pull off the impossible after massive layoffs and the cancellation of all non-GW-based projects, had kind of a small we-made-it party for themselves and invited a bunch of people for an announcement, but didn't tell anyone that it's just a we-made-it party with an announcement, so everyone thought the guys who never say anything have to have a lot to say if they throw a whole fucking party! So now everyone is let down by the fact that next to nothing has been said, and crazy people seized the moment to shit all over the game from start to finish because it's not the game they want it to be. Yeah no shit, hasn't been that kind of game for seven years, what else is new.
---
&gt;    GW2 is going into its fourth iteratation of Living World / Living Story called 'Sagas' and everyone is curious as to what to expect. (Because Anet didn't tell us! Yesimsalty.)
---
Re game: now if the perfect time. You get both expansions in a 2for1 and a huge sale on all seasons of living story. In two weeks the next, even bigger iteration of living story starts, this time called Sagas. You also get 7+ years of content for a steal.
---
those Director's Cut posts by Luke Smith are _so fucking good_
---
It's so transparent and obvious through that post that not only are they aware of what they didn't do well, but also that they are working on solutions to a bunch of them and learned from them. 
---
I only recently got back into Destiny and seeing that post really gave me the feeling that there is a super passionate game director (and team!) behind the game and that even if they don't do everything well on their first attempt, they will try to fix it and learn from their mistakes.
---
and all we get from Anet is silence and quaggan shitposts (and merch, yay.)
---
If Gw2 is meant to be focused on the story, why is it so bad? The story is so generic, predictable and bland that I still didn't manage to finish season 4.
---
After letting  the announcement sink in for a while, here's my feedback as a player that originally pretty upset about it.
---
The announcement itself, without taking into account its content and consequences, was a full succes. Unprecedented amounts of people were hyped and watched the stream.
---
The content of the first part of the announcement was also great. The trailer was amazing, you confirmed that you're still working on pvp and wvw projects and did not ditch them along the way, as many people thought.
---
The second half was merch. Dont do that. Pls. Never.
---
The announcement itself was way too short, considering you planned 45 Minutes in, that was not a good move. Keep the theater, plan 20 Minutes for the announcement and advertize merch AFTER or before the event has officially concluded / started pls. It might not sound like its different, but really it is. There needs to be a clear cut in between. 
---
Please keep on doing announcements like this if given the opportunity, but do some group therapy for the community before (by giving them realistic expectations). 
---
Also, you should mention gamemodes that you currently arent focusing on as well, at least with a few words (fractals - discontinued(?) but working on future concept or replacement, raids discontinued until data from strikes has been analysed).
---
Thats it from me, and even though "my" content is not covered by your next releases, i'm sure your future releases will continue the trend of ever increasing quality past patches have seen. 
---
Best regards, internet person thats not hard quitting the game xd
---
Coming back after that long you're basically a new player, I do recommend leveling normally for at least a little while to get back into the feel of the game and then saving the boosts for other characters. If you feel like you have a strong feel for your profession and the game feel free to use a boost. Really if you level normally it doesn't take very long at all since pretty much everything gives exp (especially events and monsters that haven't died in a while like yellow named ones).
---
Good thing is a lot of the new things are not made to synergise, so you can easily take 1 thing and focus on that till you feel sufficiently informed and then move on to the next part.
---
Bullshit. Fractal are rushmode dungens for idle game players and reused season 1 story instances.
---
I want my 2h Arah expirience back. I want to achieve something in a dungeon, not just killing a boss for loot.
---
Pls just stop hiding your hate behind ‚Äûcriticism‚Äú
---
When Raids can be 4 manned with enrage timers your DPS choice doesn't even matter lol
---
About that ancient jotun city - i would love to see more preserved citys in general :)
---
thank you :)
---
&gt; If an Easy mode exists, they will try that easy mode, and they will not develop that itch or get that satisfaction, meaning they'll be less likely to progress to the "real raid"... They'll simply be done with the experience and probably never try raiding again. They've seen all the boss animations, they've heard the dialogue, they've experienced the map, there's not much left for them to try.
---
Let me chime in with my own and other's WoW experience: this is totally true, and I'm sure it would (or will) happen. In WoW before LFR (dumbed down raids with automatic group maker) there were a ton of casual raiding guild. Just some people who don't want the best gear, don't want progress raid, don't mind to wipe a bit more, don't mind to get a few pugs for their raids. They just wanted to finish the raid sooner or later. Maybe that means at the end of the expansion. But that does not really mattered because they did it this way, or they never did the raid.
---
What happened after LFR? Well these guild stayed, because friendship and whatever... but almost all of them soon got disbanded or abandoned, because it was impossible to recruit. Who wanted to wipe a lot, waiting for guild members to show up, recruit new members or getting pug when you could just click on the LFR button, get into the raid at most 30 minutes, and finish with it in 20-30 minutes per wings? All of this provided almost the same gear as what the casual guilds could have achieve, so that's also no incentive.
---
Sure you can say that people do this because they want this, but just as the op writes they simply don't know what they miss. Finishing a raid with a (casual) guild is simply not the same as downing the bosses in LFR.
---
I'm not sure what these strike missions will do with raids, but dumbing down raid content to "entry level" is simply not the solution.
---
If I am ever in NZ I will make sure to visit their offices, I want to personally thank all the devs for the 7000+ hours of fun they have given me so far.
---
Do Kiwi's eat cupcakes?
---
That's a good point. I have no idea what I'm doing, still lol. I made the mistake of using a random weapon skin, while I unlocked barely anything, so it gave me a bronze axe skin.
---
I knew to fill my character slots from playing GW1, so now I have 10x level 20, 5x 30, 5x 40, 5x 50, 5x 60 boosts and sooo many 24hr +100% boosts. Guess I'll save them for a bit longer. Thanks!
---
The gemestore is a big collection I need to get
---
Not that far off from poe pricing on most things.
---
The vast majority didnt even try raids because of its stigma or because it is not solo content.
---
I dont want to grind SW or do the festival stuff and thats okay. Its there for other people. Not everybody has to like the same stuff in a game and its great that GuildWars got many different modes which please different people.
---
But complaining about smth and not really trying the mode or just say whaa its too difficult but then dont try to improve themselves or atleast getting the right gear/traits and i dont know. Playing with the bare minimum. I dont know why people want to play that content in the first place then.
---
&gt;Sure it's pinned at the top of the sub-Reddit but people are likely not to scroll through it and everyone knows it.
---
Then they should start scrolling through it. Of course it's not gonna work if no one even tries.
---
There are already a few constructively worded comments. That's how it should be instead of hundreds of what are essentially spam posts repeating the same things. Sure there are higher-effort posts in there but they get lost in the flood of low-effort posts (both defending and criticising anet).
---
I pirated it as well, but bought it shortly after I noticed I put over 100 in the pirated copy in under 2 weeks and felt really guilty. (This was before I even knew they had a demo as well)
---
I‚Äôd say use some of your boosts and try to level while you get back into the story and figure out what you‚Äôre doing again. [My guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Leveling) has a section on leveling (and other nice links, guides, and details).
---
As someone who used to raid a lot, but hadn‚Äôt found the time to get back into it, Strike Missons were the only thing that I found exciting about the announcement. I‚Äôve been hoping for a while that they would do some transition to raiding features in the game and this sounds interesting.
---
I guess all those players who written posts here on reddit about their account being terminated and they lost all their work and have to re-buy the game again also thought they could trust the key sellers.
---
Bad things don't happen until they do.
---
Core tyria is a bit outdated IMO, but gw2 is an awesome game with awesome mobility, awesome combat later on when you gain access to and understand boons and thousands of hours of content.
---
all raidbosses "require" a group setup to cover boons and dps...which classes do it is irellevant if you are not going to do a speedclear of all wings.  
---
the groupsetup over at snowcrows is the meta for SPEEDKILLS and not what many guilds run in their weekly.  
---
when your commander says that you can't use your power soulbeast on a powerboss and requires you to go on dragonhunter, then i would run from that group as fast as i could...soulbeast is perfectly viable and has a massive burst...and with the right traits even adds to the dps of your group.
---
You're wrong, I don't hate this game.
---
&gt; If an Easy mode exists, they will try that easy mode, and they will **not** develop that itch or get that satisfaction, meaning they'll be less likely to progress to the "real raid"... They'll simply be done with the experience and probably never try raiding again. They've seen all the boss animations, they've heard the dialogue, they've experienced the map, there's not much left for them to try.

If I said that by not having an easy mode, people who are put off by the difficulty will never even attempt the content, thereby rendering development hours wasted as compared to if there's an easy mode, it will be an argument as presumptuous as the argument you're making because neither of these assumptions are backed by any facts.
---
There just isn't enough information to know exactly what role these should fill. My personal favourite baseless theory is that the strike missions will be easy mode released with each episode and then towards the end of ep 3 or something they will have all been recruited by jormag, gaining their mutations and together forming a raid wing. 
---
It would mean they can double dip on content a bit while providing simpler raids. Imagine slothasor not having poisons to place and spawning less slublings.
---
Which hopefully is the point sort of strikes, you will ideally be able to go in mostly blind and a shot at clearing in a few runs if your builds are half decent.  Having strike raids have clear intuitive mechanics without too much overlap should be the goal imo. No need to have watched lots of guides and easy to 'feel out' the right way to do bosses probably with some 'you,re doomed to explode' style text for good measure and avoiding too much reading mid combat action key pop-ups.
---
So not only did they make the announcement before the weekend, but before a long weekend? With no plan to address stuff? That's a recipe for a disaster.
---
I'm talking ascended gear, are people actually raiding with just exotics?! I have a full roster of characters and only one is fully ascended (Fractals was never kind to me) after much crafting, I couldn't even imagine suddenly redoing all my gear because cond+ damage is hot stuff for one patch and so on. I generally gear adaptively for dungeon, fractal and solo play but every raid LFG message I've seen has been pretty imposing about gear and roles. 
---
But I know I'm not cutting it full slack not having done it. I can't even imagine how aggro works in a game without aggro skills. I'm not knocking raiding in GW2, I know some people love it, I'm just saying I LOVED dungeons in GW2, something the game launched with! I did them all daily and I've never had more fun in an mmo than with my pre-nerf Elementalist that caused a combo explosion with every-single-dodge-roll (this nerf came fast though).
---
So I miss it. Fractals aren't even close and raids are another beast as we've mentioned.
---
Another feature that to this day is expansion exclusive: guild halls. No guild halls were announced.
---
Don't want to get offtopic too much, but:
---
When Shadowkeep arrives, on October 1st, the game will largely go Free2Play, so at this point you may as well wait and see for yourself.
---
But if you want to jump in right now, here's my view - the past year of D2, since Forsaken released, has been a constant barrage of engaging content on basically monthly basis, and Luke basically confirmed that that's how they're going to roll moving forward. It's the game i wanted it to be since the beginning, and with Shadowkeep it looks like it's going to get even better.
---
I highly recommend checking out their ViDoc, even though it's kinda filled with old info.
---
https://youtu.be/WVk4PkTG99o
---
True but op was talking about personification of the company in order to get sympathy.
---
If you haven't bought HoT yet, how likely are you going to come close to that cap in the near future?
---
It's not gonna work, but you'll never know, so I have a question:
---
# Are new elite specs gonna be released in the nearby future, or not at all?
---
Oh wow thank you very much for the detailed answer and all those useful links!!
---
For build I'm not that far off based on what I see on Metabattle. I've been running a Guardian with great sword most of the time, and a scepter for events and pulling mobs, with full offensive stats everywhere. My traits are completely random though. I've maxed all but one, and I've enough skill points for dragonhunter when I reach lvl 80.
---
The links about the story are very helpful! I may just read/watch recaps by you and others for LW 1&amp;2, and buy it later if I'm still as hooked as I am right now.
---
As for my armor, based on what you're telling me and the builds on metabattle, I might aim for a full berserker exotic armor at first. I have nowhere near enough gold for an ascended armor, and the legendary tier is pure cosmetics.
---
Thanks again for taking the time to answer me!
---
Even if I wanted to buy all the slots, I'd still be missing the 1 that I could have eventually gotten.
---
Just playing the devil's advocate, this is exactly why some people don't see any "real" form of progression. Always seeing that the collection is not complete or some parts of the collection you know you won't ever touch but you're either forced to do them or you won't get the shinies are few examples of a different form of grinding. There are many ideas to make grinding more fun and rewarding by at this point, I lost hope for anet to come up something original.
---
Trust me, when you said fantasy life simulator, I agree completely. I used to come on just to talk to random people who are on and goof around and it was alleviating my depression. Now that I don't need a life simulator as I am living life (in a different timezone), I actually need a "game" to play and sadly this isn't one of those. I don't have 2-5 hours to burn.
---
Well anyways, glad the switch in perspective is keeping you going. I hope that I either have enough time to play gw2 or find the game interesting again to come back.
---
&gt; Why is there so much dissapointment now?
---
Players created hype around an announcement and imagined all kinds of their wished to come true. Then, predictably, they didn't, so now they are disappointed.
---
Anet hyped up the announcement on August, 30, even gathered people for an IRL event. Then proceeded to talk about what everyone already knew. Sure we didn't know some story details and strikes are a new feature, but it was barely enough for a blog post, let alone an actual event.
---
Now we have reddit giving anet PR lessons
---
True. Is that really so much of a problem? It's a problem most players would actually like to have. :)
---
I agree with her.
---
And to be honest, this subreddit has been a cesspool the past couple of years with constant negativity. I don't want that in my life so I am I subscribing.
---
If you don't like the way the company is running their game, don't pay them. If you have played the game for hundreds of hours, they deserved the 50$.
---
It might be beneficial for you to join the snowcrows community discord as well.
---
If you have questions about a build etc. there is a great place to ask. You'll most likely find someone who will answer your question.
---
You'll find the invite link under the community section on their site.
---
Why not? Theyll get back to you when they can.
---
Not OP but I'm interested in LW seasons 2-3-4 too. Thanks for the heads-up! I considered skipping them for now and focusing on the expansions regardless of the timeline, but if there's a sale I might reconsider. Good to know!
---
People would like to be missing the only slot they can't get anymore?  am I just reading this wrong?
---
Dhuum and Twin Largos both have hard enrages, and I think Qadim would eventually destroy all the platforms if the DPS on the wyverns is too low?
---
Interesting, Wiki doesn't have any information on this IIRC.
---
‚ÄúMost people‚Äù don‚Äôt care at all about this and will probably continue whatever they were doing before the announcement regardless. The game did not suddenly become worse as a result of it.
---
A lot of people think it's the best. It's outliving other mmo's and pulling people away from other (presumably) 
---
I take reviews of this 6 year old game lightly. Especially when you can straight up buy 9.5 out of 10 from the professional game reviewers. 
---
I like this sub reddit for game news, fan art and fun stuff. Otherwise it's just a place to blow off steam.
---
The barrier to killing any boss is actually quite low, dhuum for example is 32 million hp at 10 minutes meaning it's a 53,333.33~ dps group wide to kill. If you can pull 6k dps per person on average which is ridiculously low you'll clear it. Same goes for damn near any boss.
---
the thing is this is a B2P MMO. All those features need resources to continue development yet most of the money comes from PvEers that likely dont Raid/SPvP/WvW
---
Bad things happen because of bad people with bad ideas. Humans merely existing does not cause bad things to happen.
---
7 years ago i came from another game were i was a Hardcore raider and spent most of my time when not raiding grinding for special things that you as a hardcore raider had to get to stay on top. It took so much time from my real life that i decided no more. I played GW2 on the side for a while but then i swapped over and left my hardcore raiding behind me. 
---
I needed a game that i could log out from at any point because family needs. This is what GW2 offered me. I can always leave the thing i do without screwing up the situations for others. And if i want to play any instanced content i can play my time for that without having to grind 24/7 all year around. Much less stress and much more freedom. And my kid grew up and play GW2 as well now :)
---
The core game is free. This is were you level your character from 1-80. How long that takes is up to you. Some do it within days, other takes weeks or months. Be aware of that the care game is very simple. A way to learn the game and how to play your character until you reach expansions. Expeansions will make the game harder to deal with, mobs are not one shots anymore and content can feel frustrating at the start until you learn how to deal with it. Expansions are worth it all. It offer so much more then the core game do. How ever core game is also populated by endgame players because in this you will never grow out of any area. And things you gather will never be worthless. 
---
The reason people are upset at this very point are 1. We had a event from Arena Net were we expected more info but we did not get that much that we wanted. This will likely change over time and we will get more info during the 3 weeks when we wait for season 5.
---
And 2. Veterans who have thousends of hours behind them have pretty much done everything that the game have to offer and feel they have not much else to do inbetween new content which upsets them.
---
So that was the long answer, Short answer is yes it is worth trying out GW2.
---
I understand that. But it's a bad idea to make an announcement and go radio silent. Have your community managers and/or other responsible people on call for a potential weekend work to address stuff if needed.
---
2 years ago i would hands down agree with you. HANDS DOWN. Things have changed for Anet.....they, as a studio,are in a very bad position atm. 
---
I cannot stress how important this is. The biggest,most experienced,most talented devs were snatched by amazon (bigger salaries and bonuses). Ben who was the prominent figure in instanced PvE and the lead behind the amazing fractal CMs left while others were fired in droves leaving mostly the lw and narrative teams. Grouch who pushed for competitive pvp also left*.
---
So, restructuring aint ez,u shuffle people around to fill the teams but the expertise is no longer there. It takes double the amount of time to release content when u have open world devs working on instanced content and the few really unlucky ones are assigned to PvP,WvW with big workload,limited resources and low priority.
---
Meanwhile content release is slow af,people are leaving left and right while making negative feedback and revenue is lower,forums start boiling with criticism and disappointment, ncsoft starts to intervene on management to push gem store,lootboxes and prioritize to the main customer (which aint the hardcore player).
---
Anet struggle to find pace and an expansion doesnt seem realistic at this point. For HoT they hired a lot of new teams just for the expansion.I doubt ncsoft would even give them the funds when anet is unsure how the development could go. Add anets' poor management and marketing to all this and you can see how it snowballs into a tight situation were they have very little control over their product and how it goes forward.
---
I could add more to this wall of text but even i feel tired typing this....
---
I'd avoid weapons that focus on conditions (bleeding, poison, torment, etc) whilst levelling 1-80. The core game mobs are too weak to ever get enough value out of condition damage, plus a lot of hearts and events will have you attacking inanimate objects that are completely immune to conditions.
---
Your best bet is to prioritise power&gt;precision&gt;ferocity for stats on your gear, and use a dagger+warhorn in one weapon set and an axe+warhorn/focus in your other. If you use warhorn in both sets, just equip a single axe in your second set, there's no need to buy two warhorns.
---
The trading post usually has very cheap weapons for all levels from 1-79, there's no need to buy expensive rare (yellow text) versions, you'll outlevel them quickly.
---
Not everyone is going to find every game appealing. If this one isn't holding your interest, find one that does? That's my best advice.
---
The other advice is that if your training guild is being too elitist for you, maybe you're simply in the wrong guild.  Just a possibility.
---
This game works for me, because I like different content than you do.  That is, I could care less about raids, but I like everything else and everything else is doable. I play with my friends in my guild daily so I'm having fun. If you're not having fun, either change your situation or change the game. Those really are the options.
---
The first scenario was this playerbase before they had been getting ignored and condescended to for years by anet and the more toxic parts of this community.
---
The moderation here is laughable. The community is upset and people are posting threads with issues that affect the game and playerbase as a whole, they are issues directly tied to the game. Yet you now want to keep it all in one sticky thread? 
---
Yet we'll now go back to the literally hundreds of low-effort and talent art pictures that spam this sub daily, along with "yay my first world completion after 7385 years", "look at my shiny legendary" or "insert shit meme here" posts.
---
All the moderators have signalled with this is that they don't actually want game-related discussion on the sub, they just want an easy life filled with fluff posts and casual circle jerks.
---
Allmost all PoF masteries are "free", most of the HoT ones are super easy too. You should easily be able to aquire enough hps to get both elite specs in 1 hour...
---
At the same time, I have helped out far too many training raids to come out the same, and I can tell you that if an exp player doesn't plan to listen to voice, they just won't hop in voice at all. They will take chat commands and generally have a good idea of their capabilities. Yes, I have been in a few^1 odd groups that don't click for one reason or another (10 players with KP failing to make headway against Cain a few times comes to mind^2 ), but they feel less notable than bashing your head into a wall for 4+ hours trying to train a newbie group who probably turned their speakers and chat off for all the "improvement" they show.
---
All that being said, yes the number one skill needed for a good raider is communication. A simple "help, what does this mechanic do" or "lagging a bit" or "I've never done anything but use rifle warrior on world bosses, what do I do" can make all the world of difference. Heck, even a "I can't perform that role, I have never done it before" when assigned a role is super helpful (looking at you silent "I'm too cool to look at comms" "exp" raiders^3 ).
---
I will say, helping a training group through a kill is a lot more satisfying than getting a kill on the same boss with an exp PUG (assuming the training group listens and you can get a sub 1 hr kill and don't just want it to end, but are too stubborn to leave). A group that clicks however, is a beauty in and of itself, and should be treasured for the brief time you run with them.
---
(Apologies from unloading that on you, a random stranger with a good point, I've just been looped into helping train a group under the guise of "oh, we know how to raid, we've been doing this for years^4 , we just need a commander" and then having them fail MO for an hour straight, and am just super done with it.)
---
1: Ok, more than I want to admit. Far strat Deimos is especially notable here. Only 3 people have any mechanics and yet the group still dies like flies (while those 3 do their mechanics perfectly).
---
2: Come on people, it's Cairn. Yes, we have 4 people constantly up, but those are the support players, who, remarkably, cannot get a fast kill even if they weren't constantly rezzing the DPS. You're the one that said you were exp DPS.
---
3: It doesn't matter how high your DPS is on the log. If you're not doing the mechanics assigned to you, you aren't raiding, you're just doing a DPS golem that kills party members. You know who you are.
---
4: Which is true. I know, because I helped try to train them the last time they were all in a group, before the release of wing 4. They made no progress then either.
---
&gt; I've seen a lot of posts that I'm personally uncomfortable with because people don't deserve abuse, particularly if you're mad at the company. 
---
And where exactly have you seen them? At the bottom of threads, downvoted and hidden? Because that's where they are and why we, here on reddit, do not need to talk about it. 
---
We waste too much energy on this shitty discussion.
---
i think that was just some random footage with level up animations and weapon switching so they can show us "something" on screen.  
---
we have not seen any ui nor anything else regarding to that, so it may as well be placeholder footage so it looks like they have done something.
---
Since you never replied, I guess I'll ask again, did you intentionally ignore the comment past the first sentence on purpose because you had no argument against it or was there another reason you pretended it didn't exist?
---
&gt;I thought the whole point of fantasy was to explore different unique worlds and different cultures with their own viewpoints, but most writers just project their ideal vision of a perfect society based on contemporary politics instead of trying to create intresting worlds with nuanced conflicts.
---
&gt;The only two factions in the game to come close to even breaking that mold, icebrood and flame legion, were writen out of the story for the past 7 years and had their respective ideologies be flatter than oil on a pan because nobody wants to make an actually moraly grey villain with verboden nono viewpoint.
---
&gt;Writing in gw2 has never been that good or impressive, but lately it has been going on what is generally a downwards spiral, so I wouldn't put it out their reach to make jormag female or something along those lines just to spite le ebul seksists because yas kween slay or an equally asinine reason.
---
it comes down to rewards,lets be honest raid rewards are trash. this is EASIER than raids and i wonder what rewards we can expect =)
---
I get to some before they're downvoted. Two monitors can be a mixed blessing. As for energy wasted, there wouldn't be a conversation if you weren't replying. I've said what I had to say.
---
I'm pretty sure the "HoT is free" is meant for HoT content, not the additional goodies. As for the caps... I don't know, really, maybe it's the way they coded it or they just didn't realize and will increase the cap further down the line?
---
What? I never had any problem with them. 
---
Stolen keys are the devs' fault because they generate them. Marketplace is only place to sell. It's just like you accused eBay because it can sells stolen phones or bikes. 
---
When it comes to banning, it's good that a dude who has two accounts or suspicious activity can goes to the blacklist. But also he can provide documents and be unbanned.
---
You forget that Charr society has no concept of actual parentage. Thus, I assume that it's less about Rytlock's cubs struggling with who their father is, and more about Rytlock caring more about his cubs than he should (based on Charr societal norms). Not only was this hinted at in the Twine story, it also seems like Bangar is aware of Rytlock's weak spots/ aware of where Rytlock differes from the norm, which is why he baits him with such a specific insult.
---
We kinda have this with wing 4. The bosses are on average mechanically easier than the other raid wings, and there was a heavier emphasis on story (even going so far as to put in an achievement only for story, achievable without killing any bosses).
---
Yes agreed,lay offs were the result of anet neglecting the main game in favour of projects. But amazon sniping their head leads was a major punch in the gut. 
---
Im not defending Anet here. I played almost exclusively fractals/raid/dungeons and i feel disappointed but realistically at this point they cant do more than what they announced at the theater,even if they were dumb enough to overhype the community.
---
I disagree slightly. I see GW2's nature as having dedicated rewards for doing the content you enjoy. Some of that is collections, but there's also plenty of rewards for doing raids (ascended gear with unique skins) and other content (PvP/WvW skins). The goal is to have rewards that players can progress no matter what they play. But yes, in general, I agree that the idea is to find something you like and do things to acquire that thing.
---
Yeah, and the rest of the civilized world laughs about that. As a german dude who knows a bit about law and how we handle this, it's even more ridiculous than from a normal point of view.
---
Oh no, dearest. It is not GW2 itself we are displeased about. It's Anet.
---
You would, actually, learn that from all those comments, if you cared to read.
---
Just like u/TehChaza said: if you're displeased with the reddit's complains, then leave reddit.
---
I assume you're not a hypocrite.
---
Which would add like about 30 mins of grind, which is my point. It's not really a valid point of complaint to say that aquiring new elitespecs requires a lot of time or effort when they are basically handed to you.
---
I don't think you are in any danger of having to pull a carney.
---
&gt; Yes agreed,lay offs were the result of anet neglecting the main game in favour of projects. But amazon sniping their head leads was a major punch in the gut.
---
This is something I'm not certain (sorry for not adressing that part from previous post). I was under the impression that both Colin and Grouch left on their own. 2016, right after HoT, was probably the moment when anet changed their priorities and shifted devs into new projects, undercutting gw2 development. They may have decided to not be part of that anymore and moved on.
---
This is all based on assumption that official announcements from the company were sincere.
---
MO is a heavy dps check? [People beat it with no weapons](https://youtu.be/fqhHISQeqv0).
---
a. Free to play accounts have no access to map chat. This is to prevent gold seller spam.
---
b. This game is all about choosing your own goals. Play it like Skyrim instead of an MMO with a breadcrumb trail. Anything you see you can react to. Explore. Watch and listen to NPCs. Live in the world. That's the best way to play this game.
---
If you're on a US server and you want a guide, I can show you how to get around a bit better. But if you're a free to play account, you'll have to give me a character name, so I can add you. This will allow you to whisper me at any time.
---
I believe this is only on the table because there are a lot of glider / backpack combos.  Where the glider is dyeable and the backpack is not.  Could just be easier for them to add.  Weapons would take way more time.
---
Im in group 3... or 4
---
Nm should become easy mode aka easier than now and cms should become repeatable and harder.
---
Give the 2 main groups something to play so the raiding maps bosses etc seem much more participation.
---
Then go back to lv and make content like that, for example make palawa joko a 10 easy and cm raid 1 off.
---
Just to shed some light, the reason why EU servers are not active is because long before the game's current state it was generally understood that the NA servers is where people would be. It wasn't official it just kind of happened, so most people congregate there. Not saying you are wrong, the game certainly is not super popular, but I think considering it's age and how it's been ignored and forgotten for the most part I'm surprised at all the community events going on. I thought it was a lot less active until I joined one of the bigger guilds, people use guilds for pugging now.
---
Servers do not open by it self this was changed years ago. Servers open if Arena Net open them.
---
Here's a random thought:
---
Maybe putting the biggest announcement they had in 2 years on the day before labor day weekend was a shit idea.
---
The internet is flooded with disapppointment and shit after the announcement. This is a crisis.
---
That's not how games work. With this logic someone else could come up with an argument such as "I don't like doing world bosses but this one collection requires a drop from Mark 2 Golem".
---
See where the problem is? Everything can't be made optional or all we'd do would be walking around and pressing F (which is already the case with some stuff)
---
&gt; I think they're trying to avoid -any- period of content drought, including the months between episodes, by constantly releasing pieces.
---
let's see first if this is actually the case because they also had a very tight release schedule in season 1 and 2 which was absolutely not sustainable.
---
All of the above, actually. Most releases have unique skins that drop from certain events/champ bags (i.e. the Darkspear, Amala's Scythe, the Phase Scalpel, etc.). Then there's craftable weapon/armor sets like Stellar/Astral/Dragonsblood/Heroic Dragonsblood weapon sets and Elegy/Requiem/Mist Shard/Blooming Mist Shard armor sets. Then there's some that are rewards for completing the episode's meta achievements (Corsair armor) or special achievements (Staff of the Inevitable).
---
Very few people know about some of these skins (I think the random dropped ones are some of the rarest and cheapest skins outside of the base game) and there's so many of them to go for.
---
Id add https://lucky-noobs.com sc is pretty ded and does not get updates as regularly.
---
&gt; Comaping
---
Me being right or wrong has nothing to do with people ignoring raids. If some content gets released and for whatever reason im not interested in it then i will ignore it. Is it that hard to perceive? PvP and WvW have been ignored by most playerbase for 7 years,is it because they found barriers and time constraints and difficult content? No, they simply weren't interested in it.   Sometimes i feel like im talking to donkeys.....
---
Not gonna disagree, just meant to point out that the date they went with was rather inflexible since they probably would have rather it not be so long between the announcement and the next worn day. 
---
But then again they used to occasionally reveal stuff on guild chat which was always fridays...
---
Thanks for the info. So you are saying that if I talk with people I can get the idea of what I am doing?   
---
Because often I would find myself in the middle of the quest and just after I finish it find some info on what I just did. Breaks immersion a bit.   
---
This chat thing is a huge bummer though. You cannot really enjoy MMO with others if you cant hear them. 
---
Unfortunately I am in EU but thanks for the offer.
---
Why do you hate higher levels playing with you? Is there any problem to it? Very rarely will they be competing for the trash mobs with you (the few ones they can one shot) so I'm confused as to why it's an issue.
---
I'm fine with roleplay - as long as in every chat, except /map and /say.
---
It's cringey otherwise.
---
They might actually increase the cap for those that didn't buy HoT.  So still give people the opportunity to reach cap, but not let other people get to 25 if they already have all 24.
---
F2P variant of the game comes with various limitations which aim at: annoy you so you'd purchase the full game (tho, some players don't mind these and still have fun) and keep gold spammers and alike from disturbing the chat and players - second thing does the job almost perfectly (sometimes desperate spammers manage to spam but reported they disappear quickly). 
---
Questing here is different than in other games - instead of NPC that tells you to go somewhere and kill rats then return for rewards and another quest of killing boars/wolves/whatever, we're having thing that's called events. Events occur within certain area, periodically (often 10-15mins windows) and involve scripted situations in which players can participate and help NPCs in various ways (escorting, defending, fighting with, carrying items to certain spots etc.). Range is indicated on minimap as orange ovals, NPCs and objects as orange icons; event can be manually triggered by talking with NPCs and that will tell you little orange star.
---
If you type event name or at least part of it shown in orange in sidebar, in chat input line preceded by /wiki command your browser will fetch game wiki and show you the event or search results containing it. Wikipedia command is also useful with learning about items or landmarks.
---
Anyone can participate in events - rewards are shared among players that managed to join. 
---
The yellow hearts you see are basically one-time per character static events on core maps; heart hubs may indicate events happening in the vicinity. 
---
The lack of the clear direction is done here by design: you *should explore*, see every corner of the map and talk to the NPCs, help them if they do run some event. Almost everything in the game gives you exp - from events, through discovering landmarks, gathering materials to reviving NPCs and players. Do not rush - take your time. 
---
As for population - people are here but mainly occupying places where important, lucrative things happen and that cover other places you'll still about to see; sometimes starting zones are being flooded by players because world boss is about to spawn and then zone is pretty empty because people jump to next boss or elsewhere. Of course activity also depends on time zone you're in and region; it was mentioned few times in this sub that EU server is more organized. 
---
Regarding higher level players - if they're entering into maps like Queensdale or Metrica Province, they're temporarily downscaled to the content but still significantly stronger than native players. And they will be present because variety of objectives are still being available in low level maps. As for people striking mobs with mounts - you sadly can't do much about it; some people just refuse to understand that there are new players around who just started playing and striking group of Ettins for example, with Springer rolling doesn't help them at all.
---
There is this much negativity due to being unable to give valid criticism due to people like hinawerden.
---
Cant make a post outlining the issues about wvw or pvp or raids no matter how constructive. They will be buried by whiteknights that dont care and dont want to see anything negative regardless of how constructive.
---
Make a more generic post that resembles with the frustrations of these players without going into specifics and you have enough people frustrated to offset these anti discussion carebears.
---
The real issue is certain players aggressively burying anything they dont want to see, even when they dont even care for these modes.
---
To be fair, Seiran did have funny business with an Orrian Gorilla that she communicated with in sign language.
---
Sadly though, she mistook "kill" for "I feel better" and lwt it out of the cage. Trahearne had to help with that mess, before the Commander met either of them.
---
I know whats next for pve, nothing but ez mode raids for the next 1.5 years. And more of the "amazing episodic content" that we have learned to enjoy.
---
&gt; Tyria is a living fantasy world
---
Ok but we'r in the real world here bro', the lack of communication by the company about the future of the game has no excuse
---
As someone who‚Äôs played since the beginning this is how I‚Äôve seen the game for a long time no. I also play WoW so any raiding or ‚Äúhard‚Äù stuff so did was always over there. Gw2s kind of the chill mmo I play for story, some pvp and open world.
---
I mean I care a great deal about the game and I‚Äôm a casual who enjoys the story so... whatever man. It sounds like you don‚Äôt have a very good read on other players.
---
Forsaken Complete Edition, the one that goes for 40 bucks, contains everything released to this date (Base game, Curse of Osiris, Warmind, Forsaken, Black Armory, Season of the Drifter and Opulence).
---
Almost everything has matchmaking, and Bungie actively tries to not forget about solo players (like, there are achievements and cosmetics for soloing dungeons for example). A guild or generally getting to know people comes in handy for Raids, high score Nightfalls (fractals, kinda), end game PvP, or to get some highly sought after guns.
---
Yeah for most competent people its the main game modes that take more than 10 active brains cells which ironically are the same ones Anet lets die out
---
&gt;  but I was silently baffled at why they rented a theater to announce something we already knew was coming.
---
I dont think existing players were the main target group of this announcement because (as you said), apart form the LW details there wasnt much news for us.
---
I think is was more targeted at attracting new players (plenty of those at PAX West/Twitch) and showcase their **current product**, plus explaining to them what they can expect in the future from it (which we mostly already knew).
---
Yes, because raids are so engaging to play in this game...
---
Nah I just stopped bothering after your response amounted to "Why isn't gw2 racist/sexist like me this isn't fair"
---
Also check out the GW2Wiki pages for the meta achievements. Anything with an eye next to its name in the meta achievement section is a hidden achievement that counts towards the meta. When the episode started, hidden achievements would get discussed in map chat, but nowadays there's an assumption everyone has them and you'll need to hunt them down.
---
 For instance, in [All or Nothing], (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/All_or_Nothing_(achievement\)), you get credit towards the meta achievement by getting naked in the sauna.
---
&gt; a.) population: it seems as a free account I either don't have access to global chat or chat is dead?
---
Correct. Sorry. 
---
&gt; b.) quests. My biggest problem with the game is that I am thrusted into a game and I just wander around without a clear goal in mind.
---
Yeah, that's a hard one. Heart quests and events, and later collections (which are basically story quests). The game is more about exploring than, say, WoW or FFXIV. It's considerably more free-form. Look for events (orange markings on the map) and work through heart quests - they're like activity hubs. When you get to level 30, dungeons become a thing.  
---
&gt; Am I wrong or is every event in this game open world?  
---
There is instanced stuff, but open world events are a big part of the game. Higher level players are scaled down, but it's imperfect and they probably have top-line gear. When I scale down, I make an effort not to overpower things. It's a manners thing as much as anything else.
---
Thanks, as long as we are being attacked we get our fights or we will use ballistas to catch these half-flying horsecats.
---
Conversations with their twitter accounts? No, I'm not talking about that at all. It seems like you really are forgetting we had these elaborate big reddit topics after a release, lead by MikeZ himself(and O'Brien before him) with a truckload of developers at the ready to answer questions and/or concerns about a release. And that went fine, until the Jessica Price thing happened.
---
***"Stop oppressing me!"*** - Anet snowflake developers and 'community manager' that is doing everything besides managing community
---
&gt;Also worth mentioning that things like MO are still heavy DPS checks with enrage timers, require extremely specific group comps (boon supports)  
---
No, not at all. It's around 60k dps group wide to kill boss, it's in line with damn near any other boss, that's 6k per person to not hit enrage timer. When people regularly pull 25k *each* the boss isnt a giant dps check, it's more "can you not die" boss which goes for every single boss, they all sit around the 50-70k dps range to kill without enrage, that's less than 8k per person, when people can hit 3x that regularly that's an easy 4 man carry in dps alone.
---
Oh come on, that‚Äôs completely unfair. Anyone with a minimum sense of organization would favor bundling together at one place the many comments instead of letting a shit mess spread all over the place.
---
What do you want Anet to do? To browse all the different threads one at the time, some of them being repeated arguments or carbon copy from other threads? To deal with reddit‚Äôs algorithm? Get real.
---
People keep posting the same complaints from one thread to the next instead of sticking to popular threads *already addressing their complaints*, how isn‚Äôt that low-effort? Unless you think everyone deserve to have their own thread even if it‚Äôs redundant.
---
How does having everything at one place prevent people from posting issues that affect the game and the playerbase as whole? 
---
If anything it‚Äôll just make the information more accessible and *readable*.
---
&gt; The LS reveal was just that - the annual episode reveal.
---
"That communication doesn't count because I said so durr"
---
Owl returning as corrupted was my guess.
---
1. It looks like an owl not a griffon or eagle.
---
2. Owl went into Jormag's mouth so got up close to the source of corruption.
---
3. Unlike other ED, it is said that Jormag's corruption reaches the very soul. For risen and branded (at least), souls are just trapped in the body, not corrupted.
---
4. Jormag targeted Minotaur during the PS.
---
I could see a subplot being "Jormag is corrupting the Spirits of the Wild" and we see all four who stayed behind be corrupted, with attempts on others being made.
---
Traits, in my opinion, are inseparable from one another and from the core design of the specialisation. That's my problem with your approach. You may believe differently, and I have evidently failed to convince you otherwise. I have nothing more to add that I haven't said already. Now excuse me, but I want to exit this fruitless conversation.
---
The point that I'm making in the post is that people ended up expecting more information than it was announced to be provided due to the hype that was generated through Twitch and due to the format of the event ( live in a hired venue, long in duration, almost double than PoF announcement ) and the precedent that previous similar events had set (HoT, PoF announcements).
---
How reasonable that was is up to you. It was clear to me however, that there would be major backlash if they didn't announce something like elite specs at least (for example, there were a lot of comments in the speculation posts about the Twitch countdown, gathering hundreds or thousands of upvotes in total,  that were like: "Imagine if ArenaNet only talks about story for 45m" or along those lines).
---
The community has also always been split between those that prefer easier content and those that do not, but the elite specs provide so much content, essentially, that large amounts of both sides were left dissapointed, to a varying extent.
---
First, like someone else mentioned, that is just revenue, so the amount of profit is likely much lower, particularly since NCSoft likely takes a big cut.
---
Second, the game WAS back burner. This is something I think people are conflating. GW2 was on the back burner for a while, likely because NCSoft told ANet to make a mobile game to add to their existing arsenal. That plan fell through, apparently along with a bunch of other projects, and ANet has been told to focus back on Guild Wars. So now Guild Wars 2 is the focus again. The question is: what's that support going to look like going forward? I'll be cautious in judging the prologue and the first episode because these likely still have some ripples from the layoffs/restructuring but I'm curious to see what this ends up looking like. What sort of effect did ANet poaching talent from GW2 actually have? If it actually had a big effect, then it stands to reason that the releases would now be much, much better.
---
I've wondered why the gliders systems could not have been changed or even copypasta-frankensteined into the back item slot.
---
Elementalist
---
No, I'm saying you are quite active on this medium. You have a long history of actively dismissing all constructive criticism that doesnt specifically affect you.
---
By doing this you do not allow valid criticism to be discussed or addressed. You actively dismiss and bury it. It continues to fester and leads to negativity and frustration... sounds human enough. Then suddenly you're surprised so many people are upset and despite thousands of votes and people expressing this opinion they're still just a loud minority.
---
Sorry to break it to you but suppressing constructive feedback is what forces it to be more negative, more generic and in clear waves. That's something you have frequently done for years.
---
And the fact that you currently cant bury these issues with fluff should give you a hint that it's more than a minority. But keep on dismissing these concerns because the game is made for you alone and as a hardcore casual  you still love every aspect!
---
&gt;The point that I'm making in the post is that people ended up expecting more information than it was announced to be provided due to the hype that was generated through Twitch and due to the format of the event ( live in a hired venue, long in duration, almost double than PoF announcement ) and the precedent that previous similar events had set (HoT, PoF announcements).
---
Yes, I 100% agree and have made the same point. However, I think that fair and understandable heightened expectations are those that are related to living story (as this was a Living Story event), or cross between both game modes (i.e. elite specs, as you said above).
---
On your wall maybe. You will achieve the same effect, but we won't have to read it.
---
You.
---
Me.
---
All these games you mentioned announce, show and sometimes even offer for playtest several months in advance if they are releasing a raid, or a new feature/class/specialization. ESO even created lately this Season of the Dragon thing, where they tell you what is coming out for a full year, including a mini-expansion and other features.  
---
Then you can say that they do not speak of the kind of content they did not announce they were going to speak, but frankly this is playing with semantics.  
---
First, because saying "We are going to talk of the next LW season" was as indeterminate as it gets, especially after they said for over a year that LW in the future "will bring expansion level content", so in theory every possible kind of content in any game mode". 
---
Second, because as a matter of fact the point is that their competitors go all in with what they get when they present their releases. Anet does not. Even when they presented PoF they did not mention raids, fractals or WvW. Since they later did release something in all those fields, it is a mystery to me why they take that route, and certainly a counter-productive move, based on the community's response.  
---
Finally, I am just saying that I do understand there's a distinction between Features and Content, but this does not render the expectation for Content unreasonable (even though I think the lack of new Features is, indeed, the most serious by now).
---
You are.
---
Great points, as for you point 4:  there's a world of difference between a group that wants the loot and a group that wants to learn the encounters.  GW2 raids seem specifically designed that it only takes a couple of people only interested in the former to throw off the balance of your entire team.
---
Generally I'm pretty cynical about making prominant characters related to past heroes and then giving them important roles in the story, but it couldn't be more appropriate to include Jora's descendant in a story dealing with an antagonist that so specifically hates Jora. It might have been more interesting if Jhavi were male, or even descended from Svanir, yet still rejected the Sons of Svanir, but it will be interesting to see if they take a specific interest in her.
---
I think OP is right about Rytlock and Braham playing off of each other. Mirroring Braham's story with Rytlock's son seems like an obvious thing to do. I just worry they won't forget that charr and norn cultural norms are the same as 21st century western norma. Charr and norn culture developed the way they did because it best fits their lives. Normalising the charr and the norn, or humanising them, because that's how we as 21st century westerners feel will undermine the world building and racial identity they've done with the two races.
---
I half expect Bangar to not actually care about parentage of a child but he was using it in that moment to demonstrate that Rytlock has become humanized by his distance to his own people and something that wouldn't bother a typical charr might now bother him. I actually hope they reinforce charr culture by showing Rytlock's son to be a well adjusted and functional member of charr society.
---
I haven't kept track of your active history but I only "dismiss" (and disagreeing with something isn't necessarily dimisssing it btw) with stuff I actually disagree with. Why don't you find me some examples of this actively dismissing good ideas. Otherwise, I'll just assume you're trolling me, which is a pretty good assumption to make anyway.
---
Factorio devs are above them in my opinion. :)
---
Why do you support whitewashing so much? 
---
Does the idea of "the other" scare you to the point where you want even fantasy cultures to be stripped down of all uniqueness and personality? 
---
What, unless someone is identical to you in every way they make you uncomfortable? Like, godamn, grow up. 
---
 
---
That sort of thinking is be expected from someone as shallow/coddled as you though.
---
So your number 2, regarding higher level characters. You know that all of them are scaled to that zones level right? So if you are say level 30, and the zone is say level 30-35 the level 80 players are scaled down to 35. Having higher level players around for me atleast is a sign of a few things: one, the game has a community and they enjoy being out in the world. Two, having higher level players on events can assist you in making sure the boss you are trying to kill is killed. Three, I love seeing them as mentors on the map and I think that‚Äôs a really cool feature.
---
No, I'm not directing my comments towards ANet, nor am I feeding the trolls, unless you consider yourself to be a troll, in which case, kindly report yourself to the nearest mod.
---
You should write to Anet about it anyway. Your account most likely will be permanently banned with no way to cancel it. Prepare to make new one and next time better buy from licensed shops.
---
That sort of thinking is be expected from someone as shallow as you though, its a natural result of a coddled upbringing.
---
Every point you covered is exactly what I want for Strike Missions and I sincerely hope they are.
---
As someone who's never completed a raid before, I largely agree with OP. Being from a WvW background, I don't have enough PvE friends who I can team up with, and pugging would likely end up in me dragging the team down and not completing the raid. Therefore strike missions sound like the right stepping stone to get into raiding. 
---
I cannot see how this is detrimental to the raiding community. So long as strike missions aren't overly rewarding, there's no reason for the raid community to 'split'. Perhaps in the short term as everyone wants to try out the new strike mission content, but why drop more challenging &amp; rewarding content for something easier and less rewarding? There's a reason why dungeons are dead. I can't imagine veteran PvP players bandwagoning to say, an upcoming tutorial/beginner PvP league.
---
Tl;dr - Camp 1.  Easy modes will help the raiding scene grow by introducing more people to it.
---
err it would teach them that in order to succeed they have to do better?
---
No-one *needs* a chrono or firebrigade.  All this is emergent gameplay.  I would put good money on ANet never for one single moment thinking the Chrono would be the cornerstone of practically every single raid encounter AND be the primary tank class.  Why else do you think they've spent the last 2 years trying to bleed it out?
---
&gt;All these games you mentioned announce, show and sometimes even offer for playtest several months in advance if they are releasing a raid, or a new feature/class/specialization
---
Not sure your point here. GW2 does this as well.
---
&gt;"will bring expansion level content"
---
I agree on this for sure. The vagueness of the point they said before about LS brining expnasion content, and then here discussing a new LS chapter definitely left the doors open for people to interpret it as they will. Personally, I think that expecting WvW/PvP/Raid stuff is a bit of a stretch though. Maybe if it's an entirely new game-mode/feature within them.
---
&gt;Finally, I am just saying that I do understand there's a distinction between Features and Content, but this does not render the expectation for Content unreasonable (even though I think the lack of new Features is, indeed, the most serious by now).
---
Hm, I think I get what you mean. I personally found the lack of feature announcements to be incredibly underwhelming. As they said they were going with expansion level stuff with this living story, I definitely expected new features.
---
Get the 0.17 (experimental) demo, it is reworked and way better showcasing the game. And 0.17 is more fun anyways, there was very nice rebalancing compared to before.
---
&gt;at tennocon
---
Isnt that usually during the summer? :p
---
&gt; I'm not going to jump into Mirage outside of PvP
---
Try staff in open world/casual PvE. Pretty fun for anything other than tagging mobs or perma reflect bubbles.
---
&gt; And frankly I don't like the spec, too selfish.
---
Well it's *supposed* to be, but then they made it condi-focused to ensure it'll be completely outclassed in every format where the enemy does *not* incessantly whine about condi OP, anything else mesmer has, generally being able to kill them and did I mention how OP that kittening confusion is?
---
Then again they must have expected that even without reading the "forums" considering they designed the spec around one word and a stylised pink square.
---
Very interesting mister arbiter of good ideas
---
so how do I install it? I cannot find the update to do so
---
Gw2 is completely different game than wow. It's not comparable.
---
And gw2 is imo more complicated due to how dynamic the gameplay is and due to not allowed addons.
---
The problem is I think those are known within the raiding community as the easy encounters, but that information doesn't diffuse out into the general community very well.
---
I think the points you make about the accessibility are good and I think strikes might help with some of them. I think the goal of them, like a lot of ANet content, is to get you to find a good group of new friends to play with. Honestly, half of the difficulty of raiding is finding a group of people who you work well with. It sucks to have a bunch of good people and then one asshole who mocks you because you ask a noob question. I had an example, but I deleted it because it just made this a wall of text. Everyone who's tried to raid knows this sucks. The point is, Strikes (even if they're bad/don't do the things OP says they NEED to) will help get people a group of friends to play with. You go into LFG, group with some people and hey, that warrior is really nice and is struggling with you too. The Chrono clearly knows what he's doing but is also helping people by placing markers and helping people figure out mechanics. You add them to your friends list and ask if they'd like to group up for the next strike. They agree and you now have a 3-man team. Next strike, you meet a few more cool people and your team grows. Maybe your warrior friend does a strike on his own while you're doing something else and recommends another player. Eventually you get a team of 10 that can take on a raid.
---
I honestly think it's a beautiful solution to the problems of raids, one that hopefully lets the devs feel free to make raids more challenging since they can assume players will have a better baseline of knowledge.
---
&gt;Anet is the only company among those that can present an expansion like PoF and not even mention once they have "things" like raids or fractals in development.
---
I don't recall for PoF, but HoT's entire thing was that they were adding raids IIRC? Also, WoW and FFXIV are often made fun of for saying, "NEW DUNGEONS" and "NEW RAIDS" during their announcements. Mostly, I guess, because it's expected.
---
FFXIV definitely keeps things close to them. The knowledge of what the new raid was in Shadowbringers was pretty in the dark until a few weeks after Shadowbringers launched.
---
&gt;Or make an Announcement like the other day, which is supposed to introduce us to the future of the game for at least a year
---
I am not sure if that's what I would take from it. This is all we had to go on:
---
&gt;Join Us for a Special Live Event on August 30. Are you ready to catch the very first look at an all-new chapter in Guild Wars 2's Living World story?
---
That doesn't say they are discussing the future of the game, just the future of the living story. 
---
That said, I would have much preferred if they made a future-of-the-game event, and discussed a lot more of what we can expect coming our way.
---
good point
---
Do you have any idea if you get a separate key for Heart of Thorns after the acquisition of Path of Fire?
---
The map chat is a bit misconcepted there. You still  can read it and react to it (for example commander advertising some boss). You jsut can't write in it. You still can click on names in chat and PM them, you stil lcan talk in party and squad chats, or always in /say chat that is for people directly around.
---
If there is nothing going on in map chat, make sure your active chat tab has it enabled. Chat tabs can filter certain chats, so you can for example have one tab for everything, other tab for guild chat, another tab for combat log, etc. Yet, still can happen that most of people in that zone at that time don't either have access to map chat as well (also f2p), or there is nothing interesting to talk about. Happens pretty frequently if there is no daily activity or big event around, or in off-hours in general. 
---
If you really want to talk to people, jsut stick to those other chats. As said, direct access to map chat for f2p would mean absolutely easy way for gold sellers to create new account -&gt; smap -&gt; get ban -&gt; repeat endlessly, and everyone here is glad that this spam is 100% gone from the game. even PM spammers are gone in last year in my experience.
---
For hearts I have a bit to add as well - Usually the heart person can be talked to and he usually has some basic info what is going on. Or in general, NPCs around. Many are voiced and will talk from time to time if you are there to listen. Recently devs made new tech that NPC starts talking when you get close (so they don't waste the talk when noone is listening), but that did not got updated to old maps yet.
---
Also when you finish the heart, you should get some short message within the heart reward window.  And on top of that, a lot of stuff is said by NPCs when some dynamic event happens, those usually even count into the progress.
---
God Walking Among Mere Mortals and the Hall of Monument was the culmination of that concept.
---
Do a lot of small things, build up a giant reward.
---
Surprisingly enough, people do abbreviate her name when tweeting about her due to how long it is... Though that's translated to Ocasio-Cortez being referred to as AOC in general.
---
Granted, as was mentioned in a different comment, I think Ruby was talking about Ashes of Creation, which has had its fair share of controversy in the past, and not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.
---
Jesus, the coordination to make this. how?
---
The fault with this argument is that players come to GW2 to play PvP and particularly WvW, which has survived despite minimal attention mostly because there are no real competitors.  However it never became truly great because they never properly supported it. 
---
It's just very sad to see so many players sitting on the sidelines waiting for a reason to jump back into it.
---
Ok thank you very much! Tried using their support, but they just gave me a link and told me i will find the information on their product ;p
---
In the case of Qadim, DPS on Wyverns is irrelevant, as soon as you open the Lamp and Zomorros is done damaging both Wyverns, he will keep Qadim occupied until the Wyverns are dead/the group wipes.
---
So unless your lamp somehow takes so long that your kiter has to go over 6 platforms (not sure what happens when you only have 3 platforms left with Qadim and both Wyverns alive) of kiting Qadim (which I never saw happening, worst was probably moving to the 4th platform, except from the Lamp team wiping), your DPS shouldn't be a problem.
---
Same goes for the whole encounter btw, Qadim (as most other Bosses) has a much larger window than necessary, only exception I encounter every now and then in pugs is Twin Largos, where the 2 minutes per Platform often wipe groups that loose 1 or 2 people during the encounter.
---
But that still doesn't mean that you need Mirages for it, since most people who play Mirage don't understand what to do anyway, and they'd deal more dmg on other classes
---
Leaving a dot for updates because I'm wondering this too.
---
The difference between ascended and exotic armour is something close to 2% if you don't use stat infusions which most people aren't using.
---
Trinkets are free in living story maps so you only need weapons and raids throw them at you. There are several collections rewarding you with ascended weapons for 20g and less. Pugs are like 40% behind benchmarks on golem bosses somtimes. You wouldn't even the notice between ascended or exotic armour on them.
---
I agree, I think its a great idea. I never got into raids simply because its not noob friendly at all. There was no easy way for me to start or get interested, but with this ill totally be able introduce it to myself.
---
Wing 8 in march.

Elite specs - never again.
---
Guild Wars 2 has always been ‚Äúthe casual MMO‚Äù. It‚Äôs the players that have changed.
---
Third party tool usage is regulated on a case per case basis.
---
Some tools work with a simple premise that has limited uses and can be easily regulated, but others can have both innocent uses and problematic ones.
---
It's not the innocent uses like spectating during a community event what keeps some third party tools from getting even a temporary exception, but problematic possible uses of parts of it used in other third party tools, that shall not even be mentioned.
---
Trying to make people laugh? That's a paddlin'.
---
What about aurene resurrection? Everyone predicted that one.
---
I just started playing PoE yesterday actually, it's very good but kinda overwhelming with a milion different things that drop and systems on top of system.
---
And you actually disagree with literally any feedback that isnt very, very casual. 
---
But hey, if its direct constructive criticism it's easy to say "that doesn't matter, anet should focus on casual players instead." And they have.
---
Yet when frustrations of several minority groups are pent up and combined, it's clear were talking about a sizable portion of the population. But then they're propagated by streamers or a loud minority and still no valid complaints because the most casual players dont notice yet!
---
In fact, unless its criticism towards casual gameplay there is no valid constructive criticism at all. This game is for casuals, and with how you treat feedback ONLY casuals, after all. And if you dont like peoples opinion they're trolls.
---
You need me to go through your post history for a list of examples or you see what I mean yet?
---
Not now, not ever. Won't happen again.
---
Simple...because you enjoy it , if you are playing any game but not enjoying it , if it is the game itself or your community but that is a matter of your choices , than you are wasting your time . Speaking for myself I've played it constantly since beta with a few small breaks and enjoyed it the whole time but honestly that has as much to do with the community as the game itself.
---
Pretty sure there are way more people since they did the cool thing of giving Heart of Thorns for free :p
---
It was so obvious that you can't call it prediction anymore.
---
You want them to waste time and resources on a race that can't do 99% of the game.
---
Yeah no.
---
awesome guide, thanks!
---
Yea, I'm interested in it because it might be a thing that finally pushes my friends to upgrade from f2p :D
---
Humor is pretty subjective. I simply thought a nice meme would maybe spark a chuckle out of people, and I explained below that it doesn‚Äôt indicate my true thoughts on ANet right now or the community as a whole.

I didn‚Äôt wanna offend people, but I don‚Äôt see how it could be offensive. So if I missed something, do tell me.

&gt; "Sokath, his eyes uncovered"
---
Tell me what game offers large scale rvr content with a fast-paced combat system that rewards players that understand and exploit it to its fullest potential, and I'll gladly leave. 
---
There is nothing else like gw2's wvw out there at the moment. It's not that people aren't intelligent, it's that there's nothing else out there that scratches our itch.
---
I always say Gw2 could be the best MMO of the market, when anet woulden¬¥t trow a way the hugt potential, the game has.
---
My guild has tried for years to find another wvw type game that wasn't total trash and still can't. Anet doesn't realize they're sitting on the only AVA style PvP that is any good. I know it'll never hit PvE player levels of participation but if they had put more focus on wvw I think the game would have a lot more players. I've seen entire 500 man guild's time and time again finally give up and move to other games entirely but most of them will say if they improved wvw in a meaningful way they'd be right back on gw2. There's just nothing else like wvw that isn't dogshit so we just moved over to shooters and such.
---
Well... believe it or not I‚Äôve been getting kinda carried by a chill elite squad through 40 bosses so far, I play off chrono, power DH (22k) dps at most. I don‚Äôt know much about the core mechanics at all still... All I did was doing my job and don‚Äôt hurt the squad, that‚Äôs it.
---
I don‚Äôt think 150 is that hard lol
---
And yet people still try to differentiate between companies and developers \[because apparently developers don't work for the company now\]. They don't care, none of them actively care, they pretend to do so in order to keep people quiet as they're "listening to feedback", but they don't.
---
This strange worship of developers is one of the big reasons this game and others \[like Warframe\] have gone down the drain, this worshiping of the ground these devs stand on solely because they sometimes interact with the community and pretend they care. Do you think people like Rubi Bayer \[who's blocking everyone on Twitter who even remotely disagrees with her\] or Rebecca and Steve from Warframe \[who both went berserk when a video exposing the company's nepotism with extremely toxic moderators\] give a shit?

Of course not.
---
&gt; I've maxed all but one, and I've enough skill points for dragonhunter when I reach lvl 80.
---
Just to touch on this, you don't have enough skill points for Dragonhunter yet, for two reasons.  One, Dragonhunter costs way more skill points than the other specialization lines do.  This is offset by Hero Points in expansion zones giving ten points each.  And two, you won't be able to invest any points into Dragonhunter (or Firebrand) until you've already bought all core Guardian traits/skills/etc.
---
Because of that, even if you get all 200+ Hero Points available in Core Tyria that are extras above and beyond what's needed for the core Guardian, you'll still be a little bit short of completely unlocking an elite spec once it becomes available at level 80.  Some trekking into new areas will be required!
---
I don't know, dude. I am a more casual player and I enjoy the game, but I doooon't think I am a complete idiot?
---
You have a right to be upset, you want something from this game and aren't getting it, so it makes sense you're not happy. There's just no need to call the rest of us idiots for the simple reason that we are still enjoying ourselves.
---
But we already know that an expac is in the works. It's a 3+ year process, so it's a given. We know we're getting LS5, then the next expansion. That's obvious and was implied when discussing that LS4 wasn't leading into an expansion. If you can assess the situation without having it spelled out for you, it's clear that they needed more time due to cuts on staff, and reevaluating their dev/expansion philosophy - which a good dev does so as not to grow stagnant.  
---
Bethesda expansions are underwhelming, to say the least - comparable to a full LS season in my opinion. Anyway, Anet is not going to give details on the expansion now - it's too early and would give away LS5. They don't have the content to give a 10-20 second tease, especially not without spoiling LS content. Plus, the community obviously wouldn't be able to handle it - not 1-1.5 years in advance when so much is STILL subject to change. Look at how they handled changes to scope and deliverables in the past. 
---
Maybe it's just that my life isn't hinging on a GW2 update - but the trajectory seems pretty obvious to me (just like prior to HoT when people were complaining about no expansion and the game dying - I told them it would happen, that it was fucking obvious, and it did). This is definitely not concerning enough to be having an ongoing tantrum over it, unless people really have nothing better to do.
---
Thanks! And good for you ~
---
Garden nodes unlike any other nodes in home instance affected by item booster and glyph of bounty. In my case instead of getting 8 ascended materials (I have 2 nodes) I ended up with 14-16 every day, since the cooking update.
---
Well, need to move on at last right... lol
---
Solid casual "MMO" (GW2 not a true MMO anyway) on the market is Warframe. Unlike the Guild Wars 2 it is major focus of Digital Extremes and it receive both small updates with cinematic story quests and big expansions when they are ready. big one should be going live in the end of this year.
---
However just like GW2 it lacks meaningful endgame and raids were deleted not long ago to be re-implemented somewhere down the line. But overall it is just better casual game in the better state with better future.
---
Which it wont be because that's the wvw standard. :)
---
If you have an account that includes PoF it should automatically grant you access to HoT. Depending on where you buy the game thought you might be in risk of being banned (since many of the cheaper sources for keys also resell keys bought with stolen credit cards) so if you wanna avoid that the safest thing is to stick with Anet or another official retailer. You can find the list on the website.
---
I said around six in the first hour... not total.  It has been a much higher number than that overall.  And that's a single dev in this case, and far from the only one being attacked.
---
Everyone cried for ANet because it happened.
---
Everyone demonized Acti-Blizz because less than a month before the layoffs, they got a new CFO, gave him MILLIONS in incentives alongside his paycheck and they boasted that they had record-breaking numbers in terms of money made from their games.
---
I think we're all good with a little monkey business right now :)
---
Even I take a break once in a while.
---
You will not fall behind anyone if you focus on playing something else instead.
---
GW2 will be here waiting when you get the itch again, maybe when there's new story, new maps or, gods willing, new elite specializations.
---
Try doing different things with different kinds of people. If nothing and no one clicks with you, you lose nothing but login rewards and daily achievements by leaving for a while. And if you worry about that, you can just login for the dailies and move on with other stuff.
---
Raids are dead on a more hardcore level. On EU on mondays you could get a full clear done with random people in about 3 hours, faster if you got decent group. You could even do lowmans with random people for fun. Now after disappointment that was w6 and w7. It's a clownfiesta supreme, people rage quitting left and right, having to wait forever to find replacement for those rage quitters. Average clear time with any group went from about 3 hours to 6 and that's if you're lucky, it will take longer most of the time.   It's just a waste of time, that's why i have also quit raiding, its just not worth it any more.
---
Your guess is incorrect.
---
No!
---
You can salvage them now! Much better!
---
"Why not instead of making blog posts, we have little events where the people who run the company talk about what we're working on?"
---
\*gets shit on\*
---
&gt;Contrary to popular belief the customer is not always right. If people acted the way they do in some of these posts, you'd be escorted out of the mall and not be allowed to return.
---
Now tell people what would happen in that retail if they kept hyping something up and, after people took their time and money to go there, you severely underdeliver.
---
It's easy to keep blaming the customer for the mistakes of the company, isn't it?
---
&gt; Whereas in gw2, good things are given in the form of completing collections, which is a sum of long term casual gameplay and specific goal oriented item collecting journey. Even in raid, the best items and achievements are still given out in the form of collection... not killing the hardest boss with the best group.
---
I assume you are talking about legendary armor, which does require players to clear every single boss in the first four wings at least one time to unlock the precursor, so yes the rewards are from the collection, but collections can range from buying a bunch of karma items from merchants, to killing some of the hardest raid bosses in the game.
---
Collections aren't that different gameplay wise from quest chains in other MMOs.
---
Are these the same items as the ones from the portable provisioner?
---
So? You can have content to go with those collections.
---
I don't care about rewards overly, but that I can survive without dodging in open world while in most glass cannon builds is pretty unengaging for me.
---
If pve had the resources of wvw and vice versa, this game wouldn't be infested with pve casuals to the same extent. And wvw wouldn't be dead to the same extent.
---
Yeah my understanding was that more than one person could not harvest them - it‚Äôs a one time thing?
---
There is any chance that in the future gw2hook will be compatible too?
---
&gt;Yes, everyone feels bad about the actual people who lost their jobs in the restructure. This doesn‚Äôt give the company a free pass to black lion chest and chill.
---
Especially when it was short notice and I know developers who have struggled because of the way it was handled.
---
My staff ele hits 8k autos on anything zerk without vulnerability. Revs can do more. Rev gives itself 25 might and running marauders zerk is trivial.
---
Elegies only drop from the legendary bounties.  And only one person needs to take a bound. Usually the commander.
---
Dude! Thanks I was looking for something like this!
---
Those kids are having too much fun for a stock photo shoot.
---
Waframe's devs have revealed their nice guy persona is fake since Rahetalius exposed a lot of their bullshit.
---
I've lost all zeal to Fractal (I've never Raided in the 7 years I've casually played).  
---
Gw2 is the greatest MMORPG for me because i have fun not taking things so seriously like in WoW and other grindy games.
---
Tbh I thought that too when I first saw it. XD 
---
Good thing it works perfectly for a meme.
---
I'm gonna be honest with you, I don't think you're casual if you do dungeons or Fractals (past T1). You have to do research and do lengthy gearing for Ascended AR.
---
The *actual* casuals ANet is marketing towards probably just do open world and the story.
---
Personally, I love GW2 because of its casual content. I love how I can go at my own pace to get into high end gameplay like raids and T4 &amp; CM Fractals. I personally have never felt like the game is forcing me in those directions, as those things are difficult, but give nice rewards in exchange. 
---
However, year after year, I do get more skilled and I slowly make my way up (Right now I regularly do T4's and am beginning to learn CMs and Raids). Because of this, I am glad that they have slowly been introducing challenging content, and hope they continue to do so. Almost all of my playtime is in "casual play", but when I want a challenge I know where to find it. I believe the reason some of the hardcore players are so fed up is because they were the same, but then they got to the top and realized that there's nowhere they can go to further challenge themselves. 
---
I do think Anet is doing the right thing with their additions (like strike forces), allowing people to improve at their own pace to get to raids (like how t4s help prepare for CMs) and although I was dissapointed with the announcement, I admit that I'm looking forward to everything they said.
---
Its worth menionning that alot of that is from good will that the company itself generated through past events, both with beastiary and synthesis there was alot of buzz about how flawed and badly designed they were with alot of spam about its problem either in the form of videos or essays and such.
---
Ofc ggg publicly owned up and after wards adressed these issues (to a possible extend).
---
Plus i think the health and interest in the game will reflect on its sub, gw2 is by many estimated to have hundreds of thousands players if not a million, yet its sub has a smaller team than one of the top 10 f2p games on steam. What kind of audience each game attracks is a factor but its not a strech to say ppl with little hours and families chill on this sub.
---
I feel over the time gw2 has legitimately got worse in some aspects, meaningfull aspecs and that reflects on this sub compaired to poe which simingly keep getting better and better especially after the dimmortal meme.
---
This is why I love gw2 so much! The issue I have with wow and ff14 is the main reason others love them. New xpac comes out and now my awesome legendary set I grinded hundreds of hours for is now crap compared to the white that just dropped from a low level Murlock. Guild wars 2 while taking months to get your legendary, first is not necessary to play the game as ascended items are slightly less powerful and second they are permanent. The legendary I worked so hard for is still valid today and can be traded with other characters if the builds get nerfed. I see the appeal of getting the best gear and having end game goals, but working so hard on something to have it trash later bugs me for some reason. I can do it in Diablo, but I can grind diablo in a matter of days with my schedule. Wow takes coordination, and having lots of time to dedicate that I don‚Äôt have.
---
Nah, but they can add that to next wings they do
---
Did I have to post the same shit with Anet taking a blowjob by the cult ?
---
Yes this was the basis of gw2. The devs said lets take all the crap and garbage of then current MMOs, throw it away, and put in what we want.  Another tidbit. GW2 is one of the few MMOs where it's nearly impossible to hate seeing another player next to you.
---
What??? Are you saying that you have better a community relationship when you don't have an us against them mentality?
---
&gt;Problem is that this sub has lot of people who literally keep notepad file of "failings of aNet"
---
Wrong. The problem is that "the failings of ANet" keep increasing and they don't bother to neither accept it or improve. 
---
People need to STOP this damn mentality of defending ANet or companies like them as if they gave a flying fuck.
---
Do the four PoF metas daily and you will be sorted out in a week or two depending on RNG.
---
Add in a couple of legendary bounty runs here and there and you can probably cut it down to under a week.
---
Nuh bro, it's "wrong mentality". Pro raidur dude just told you teh real truthhhh...
---
Just kidding that guy is a dummy. As a fellow fractal player i can assure you most of the bosses are easier than 100cm when it comes with free instas.
---
You are probably right. I only play like once or twice a week but I am that kind of person that likes to be informed and likes to be good at the stuff I'm doing.
---
The barriers for GW2 raiding on some of the lowest of any MMO. Get out of the shit guild and find one with *real* raiders who are willing to teach and help you.
---
I mean I'll take 9+ months for a raid rather than no raids at all.
---
Not really true, even though people keep saying it is.
---
A ton of feedback from us has been listened to and influence their decision, Yoshida and his team have even flatout admitted it in the past.
---
I think you have the completely wrong meaning of what whitewashing actually is
---
Because it's an RPG you're playing with other people. Today's MMOs (GW2 included) are just action games with occasional temporary company.
---
It's not a subscription based game, you can just leave and come back later you know.
---
It's not that I don't think that content needs to be "hard" to play together (I wouldn't consider Dungeons to be hard but I love doing them) but rather that open world and story rarely incentives you to really play together instead of next to each other. That's why I'm looking forward to strike missions personally. They sound like a mixture of dungeon and open world content.
---
Naoki Yoshida and his team are unmatched in their dedication.
---
They are the proof that giving a shit instead of trying to milk the fuck out of the playerbase actually does work. His team even secretly worked overtime to make sure hundreds of items would fit the Viera/Hrothgar heads even after lamenting that it would not be possible to do it before launch. They WILLINGLY overworked themselves because they knew the community wanted this. Hell, they did both Viera and Hrothgar BECAUSE the community heavily requested it.
---
Here with ANet however, they can't add new classes, new races or even fix animations they removed because they either don't care or don't want to.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/MMORPG/comments/cy3b5l/needs_recommendations_of_some_more_mmorpgs_after/
---
:thinking:
---
Ty all for the answers, the help alot
---
I get your point and tbh, for me the game offers pretty much and I enjoy it. But I understand why some people are upset because they feel ignored. I just really hope Anet is aware of this problem and finally starts to do something against it.
---
Guild Wars 2 has immense potential but it's not used to the fullest in my opinion, like it is for example with FFXIV which seems to offer the most complete MMO experience right now.
---
if that's what it takes to be a hardcore player these days then I must be some elitist overlord at this point for enjoying raids and fractals as well as open world and having decently geared characters
---
What makes Anet's business model even more despicable is that it's intentionally targeted and designed to go for people with gambling issues and self-steem problems. I mean, every gaming company out there seems to do it nowadays, but GW2's system is COMPLETELY designed and marketed towards this end.
---
The game's story centers around your own personal special snowflake that is loved by everyone, praised by thousands, and in the end always ends up winning against impossible odds with no consequences; every time the plot tried to diverge from this, there was a deus ex, or the even in question is completely forgotten. You ARE the Commander, Tyria's Savior and arguably most famous individual.
---
Not only that, but the endgame is completely centered around cosmethics, a small bunch of decorative items that are either completely lackluster or take forever to get by doing menial, repetitive tasks, and repetition creates habits, it enforces comincg back for more mindless clicking, so the game can develop in the laziest way possible and still make people feel they're progressing, like a cellphone game. The trick here is that the best looking items are usually on the gemstore, those with particle effects, those shiny mounts and gliders. You can convert Gold to Gems, but that's also a win-win tactic that companies implement in monetization schemes; they make it look fair, but what they're really doing is giving you a free sample of the drug and then letting you sink into it deeply. If you enter a cash shop and the only way to get the items is through money, you either ignore it completely or cash in immediately. If you can exchange currency for items tho, they make you feel you can get whatever you want "for free" if you stick long enough. Loncg enough eventually can become very long and to avoid repeating the same endless grind, you take out the credit card. That's why, say, the LP system in LoL was replaced by the even more predatory Shards system.
---
Skins might not give you any mechanical advantage over others, but they're there to give the player something else: notoriety. In a game where the ultimate purpose is to have a good looking character, adding the endgame goals behind a paywall and adding in intentionally repetitive activities to reinforce the habit and wear down the player towards spending money is a good way to prey on people who wants to be noticed. Why else do you think the company speaks so much about diversity but rarely even delivers well written diverse characters?
---
This might even be taken as a joke, but it's even clear they're trying to drag the furry fandom in, in order to cash in the solitude the people that people of said group might experience. Why do you think Charr have more furry-like, appealing designs on the trailer? Why do you think there was a charr cosplay band rocking there in the presentation? From the fanart, it's obvious that the furry fandom has a certain perception of the charr race that Anet is ready to embrace and not because they care, but because it means more money in their bags, taking advantage of them.
---
They have also shown before that they have no problem on lying to manipulate emotions. They made blog posts about Aurene's Death and using death as a narrative tool, but they made the all-too predictable twist of reviving her in the first 5 minutes (even less if you don't count the obligatory slow walk they make you go through) of the episode.
---
This game hasn't a fair business model, it's cruel.
---
Wait what? Please never give this kind of information. From any unauthorized seller the code could be retrieved through credit card fraud. Any codes gotten through that get banned when they find out: no questions asked.
---
I mean I get what you're saying but gameplay wise everything is predictable. Literally. Everything is on a timer. Story wise sure though you're correct. As for the game modes being worked on more or not. I actually think yes, you might be onto to something. Once fractals get 25 diffirent instances. Fractals are done. No need to work on them except maybe some rare polish updates. Same for raids. We got 2 with 2 expacs that provide legendary armor and a trinket. Raids are done. There is no need for any more raids CONSIDERING that now we're getting a new mode- stike missions. That's the new endgame thing and that's fine. They very well might be better than raids in almost every way besides rewards (raids have very easy and cheap to get asc gear+legendaries). It's game polish. Dungeons are complete brain dead content. Fractals are easy. Strike missions is the medium and raids is the hard content. If there is such a thing as completing a product called "mmorpg" then gw2 is pretty close to completion. I think strike missions are an amazing concept I really do and just the idea of them actually inspired me to play more support roles. Raids just make me wanna tryhard numbers... 
---
To add on top they said the story will be a litel darker and gameplay wise too with Lovecraft inspired mo sters. For me, this is what the game was missing.
---
Despite my disappointment in the LWS5 reveal, I can't help but look forward to the new maps.
---
It's already been confirmed that the prologue will take us to Grothmar Valley, and that episodes 1-2 will be set in Drakkar Lake, with episode 2 featuring a world boss, Drakkar. The trailer shows clear images of centaurs with human slaves in the Verdant Cascades, and the nearby underground Battledepths are perhaps a likely site for a Jormag/Primordus showdown. I wouldn't rule out the DSD being involved somehow, but that's still unclear to me!
---
I agree. As you say it is literally the golden egg they have that people believe could make hardcore content, whether or not that was their intial aim or not, many people find it a waste not to. Even if it is implied I think many people want some definite confirmation. IMO that is not to blame Anet and that may not even have been in their scope at all, rather it is a testament to how great people think.the game could have been, over and beyond the casual only niche.
---
Chris Wilson...Feels Good Man
---
I got two and I'm missing 3 of the skins. Now I need to decide which of the blah party masks to not get.
---
Is this one of the 1% toxic threads thats been filling this sub for the last couple days?
---
/s aside, it really helps you see in a diff light how this announfement could traslate to them and ncsoft. They've noticed the power of buzz that exoacs create (like with pof) and they ought to hype up a living world season disrigarding the things that actually got ppl talking after the hot and pof announcements.
---
A ‚Äòstory mode‚Äô could help those starting late who are reliant on pugs getting some of the collection achievements that aren‚Äôt difficult but require tedious stuff to be done in between actual boss kills that a team might not want to do. 
---
I know if I ever got the time to do raids again they could be an issue. I lost the item investment and organised team after wing 2 was added and have a few of the precursor crap still not done such as the torch lighting.
---
This game is a completionist's utopia.
---
Sorry if this was asked before, I looked it up but I admit I didn't looked it up that hard. 
---
what are the meta recipes for chef  500?
---
Until today i still hate Desert Borderland, most of us hate it, rip all Red Servers.
---
Yes, ANet loves continue doing damage.
---
I wonder if it is because the seeds can be harvested by anyone, even people without plots/chef. I assume all the people with alt accounts are doing it hardcore? What about free to play?
---
While lay offs suck, those people got great severance packages and employment assistance. No sane company is going to keep people around in roles not benefiting the company out of the kindness of their heart.

We actually don't know what was going on behind the scenes. We have assumptions and some comments to go by, but we literally don't know why they don't have an expansion ready to announce right now. Is it possible they started one a year ago but it's at least a year from release? Is it possible they decided simply to not do them, thinking Living World seasons will sustain the game as well as an expansion (the quaterly earnings would suggest otherwise from what I saw). Is it possible they don't have the ability to support both the development of an expansion and the live game at the same time anymore? If that's the case, maybe we are getting the best version of what's possible with their current resources (people already criticized the slow release of episodes during S4, if developing an expansion alongside S5 meant even slower releases it wouldn't go down well at all).
---
There is so much we don't know about what happened behind the scenes since PoF launched. Some of it we do know (layoffs) but the rest is people filling in the blanks with assumptions, which is rarely ever helpful.
---
&gt; Err, this is the GW2 subreddit. Pretty sure you meant to post this to exploits@arena.net
---
I actually reported the sharing of asc herb nodes as exploitable bug in game friday and asked CS if it was OK to use it. Of course, the bug report doesnt give me a reply and the CS reply also said that they cant tell me if its a intended design or a bug because only the dev team knows.
---
SO after 3 days without fixing or at least disabling it in game, I assume its intended.
---
Let me just quickly do that Alva mission map that surprisingly also have uberlab trial and Zana, that requires me to complete Abysses in the map, that open me Depths, and it even ends with Lich.
---
Yup, with Cyclone that's around 15 minutes, unless I halfass it autopiloting for loot and not caring about Temple layout.
---
there is no global / server chat, only map.
---
The level range is irrelevant for what seed you want. It all depends on the area you can get it in.
---
And the chance is 25% so not that low.
---
I think you're misunderstanding raids and fractals. Nothing wrong with raiding with exotic gear. Ascended trinkets are easy to come by so that's something people should at least get.
---
Ascended gear is especially forgiving for balance patches as you need only to stat swap it so it'll never go to waste. Honestly it comes down to how to  how much is  a player wiling to participate
---
I've heard that some players were buying gems from them many times with no issues, so yeah, it's somewhere in the middle.
---
English language aside I'm still going to need more information from devs. This is all very interesting but it's speculation. My line of questioning is more a rhetorical one, not a request for fan theories, as well thought out as they may be.
---
I am the part of group C who wants to find a WvW community i can pick up any time without needing to constantly check in or do rep requirements because of real life. If you know of a guild, that would be great, otherwise i am still waiting for alliances so that my friends with whom ive wanted to play wvw with can actually play, because it seems like the dedicated WvW groups only want dedicated players rather than just players who enjoy WvW from time to time. its hard to maintain a community on a mode that straight up isnt as popular, so i am waiting for the day i can do that myself in the form of the guild ive owned with my friend for years now
---
And i think you're the idiot because reading, apparently is not a skill you own.
---
Yeah, probably because the villains hardly hurt us. 
---
What did Caudecus actually take from us ? One random character we hardly knew about. Kralk "killed" Aurene and she's back the next episode. I guess Mordremoth did OK in that respect and but sadly the HoT story was rushed. 
---
Thinking back to other games, I remember hating Vaas in Far Cry 3, he didn't have the most depth to him ever, but because of what he did to the PC, I just couldn't wait to get rid of him. 
---
I've only really played GW1 as far as MMOs go, so I couldn't say if anyone else does it better, but we really need to some good villains in the next patches, I'm so bored of dragons...
---
They were taking it down because they are changing the streaming room.
---
Don‚Äôt bother with them just go do HoT method. I did one gift of desert mastery because of coalescence and I‚Äôll never do that again
---
Anet: "la la la i can't hear you, i'm already so awesome!"
---
You forgot to map in the Eye Of The North :) 
---
If am not mistaken (without looking it up) it should be around where you marked the Jormag encounter because it's where the Central Transferchamber was located in GW: EotN
---
&gt;The knowledge of what the new raid was in Shadowbringers was pretty in the dark until a few weeks after Shadowbringers launched.
---
We knew a lot about the trials, dungeons and even the Yorha raid BEFORE Shadowbringers launched.
---
If you're trying to make a point, it would be far better if you didn't lie.
---
&gt; but I think a lot of people are going overboard. Not just with what some people expected to be revealed
---
Let's be fair though - Anet went overboard as well, considering what they talked about. They did say this is going to be LW, but the timer and having a live event at a theater... the expectations were set a bit higher than blogpost-level of content.
---
You think textures cant be split? Oh dear.
---
By a dps check, i meant as with all other raids, you have a timer to beat it. I didn't mean it requires high dps compared to other bosses, because obviously it doesn't. 
---
As far as casuals with random open world builds/gear are concerned, even averaging 8k dps is still a dps "check", since they're required to have that minimum amount.
---
Hope that better clarifies what i meant.
---
Yeah, GW2 really works best as a social interaction platform evolving around a relative relaxed game frame.
---
This works even for WvW as while combat is stressful it happens only rarely.
---
You're exactly right, it would be completely dead instead of slightly dead.
---
It's basically nothing when we already knew about the Swiss tournaments and the one truly new reveal was "you'll have a new armor set".
---
If you look at the FFXIV sub during the whole BLU debacle, nobody got downvoted to this level. Nobody got downvoted massively for being positive, they merely had 1 point. It's this sub, it's this community, it's becoming increasingly toxic and unhealthy.
---
Moles
---
I mean, if you thought it was boring, why wouldnt it be now? Its the same combat, its the same game. I dont know what to tell you.
---
I did not lie. They purposefully kept Eden in the dark until its launch to avoid spoilers.
---
All bosses require a set DPS to kill in raids, you can go long into enrage on some but that's identical to saying you can 3 man VG, it's just not feasible for the vast majority of groups and shouldn't even be talked about as a viable strategy.
---
Depends what was boring and I exactly you left, so without more clarification we cant really help you
---
Ah good catch! Yes, the Eye of the North (i.e. Hall of Monuments) is just east of the Jormag encounter, directly under where I wrote "Ep. 5" -- if you squint, you can see the tower on the map.
---
&gt;I certainly do believe that the disproportion between the emphasis on the announcement and the little/ordinary content they announced is a major problem. But I also think the community is focusing too much on that. 
---
&gt;For almost a year Anet has been pushing the idea that the Living World is all they need to deliver "expansion level" content to the game. Now, THIS is the expectation they should be evaluated upon, and on this account they failed majorly. 
---
Dont u think these 2 points are connected? I went  into this event, this live event with a 48 hour countdown and a host expecting to hear how lw (which was the subject of the event) would be diff and more expansion-like like they led us to believe.
---
I was also at least hopeful for a small tease on whats comming after this saga (namely expac 3) and in both fronts they underdelivered.
---
At least having the event on their inhouse stream with non of this hype building bs would help me temper my expectation and yeet off yhe window and notion that we would hear about expac like stuff in this event.
---
They are asura, I dont understand what youre trying to get to? 
---
Charrs arent cats, they are entirely different specie, look at their horns and ears.
---
Anet had perfect opportunity to shed some light and confirm we have something to wait for three days ago.
---
When did you leave and what did you find boring? We can't give you an answer if you're not gonna give us anything to go off of.
---
You did lie since they still said Eden was a raid before launch, they simply never revealed who were the bosses \[and even so, they still hinted about Eden itself, from FFVIII\].
---
This was not "a few weeks after launch", they spoke about both Eden and Yorha being raids months before.
---
I wasn't comparing it to other raid bosses. I meant the term dps "check" in a very literal sense, as in you still have a timer to beat it &amp; a minimum required dps you need to "check".
---
Casuals with random open world builds/gear with no boons probably can't even average the mininum 8k you mentioned. Thus, it's still a dps check from the literal standard of the world.
---
Though i agree it's obviously quite easy when compared to other raid bosses.
---
Thanks!
---
They are tiny smart thingies.
---
The issue with collections is that when you‚Äôre trying so hard to go everywhere and slightly dip your toes in one area of gameplay to collect 1/50 piece of the puzzle, you lose what imo what guild wars 2 was originally good for - it‚Äôs gameplay mechanic. It becomes a game like Pokemon Go, where it‚Äôs focus is not about playing the game, but idly doing random things you have little interest in to pass the time, and disguising that fact as ‚Äògameplay‚Äô. Not to mention, when the gemstore provides you with better options than collection rewards, it completely negates any interest in doing them. It reminds me of those gamification to-do apps where you are superficially rewarded for things you didn‚Äôt want to do but did them anyway.
---
They're Asura.
---
That's their species.
---
I think you're misreading what I said. Sorry for the confusion.
---
Being how secretive NCSoft and Anet are, I wouldn't be surprised if something as scummy happened behind courtains.
---
Yay! You're back!
---
Shark rats!!
---
The problem is conquest. It's boring to watch and not the most fun to play.
---
Since we can't do genetic tests, we are limited to morphology and what devs tolds us:
---
* We know they give birth in the same manner as humans. So they would be mammals, or at least viviparous.
---
* They have hair, so they are not reptilian or avian.
---
As for their closest relatives, if we consider similarities with other races, ogres have the most with them:
---
* No or little gender dimorphism.
---
* 3 toes (Elonain ogres have 5,tho)
---
* Sharp pointy nails in both fingers and toes.
---
* Sharp teeth
---
* Long arms and large hands, and relatively short legs.
---
* Pointy ears.
---
* Little or no body hair.
---
Many creatures native to Tyria have 3 toes too. This was likely done because it's easier on computer resources to have 3 toes instead 4 or 5, but it's widespread enough while not all creatures having 3 toes, that we can consider it established lore.  
---
It's usually lore what makes mechanics, but mechanics sometimes make lore too.  
---
As for elonian ogres having 5 toes instead 3, they may have been mixed with other races, or get extra toes naturally, since polydactyly can be a dominant trait.
---
So it would seem to be that some of the common ancestor of asura and ogres went undeground, probably to escape an elder dragon in ancient forgotten times and diverged from ogres.  While asura focused on getting smarter, ogres focused on getting stronger.
---
As for what was that common ancestor, no idea.
---
Expect WoW, FFXIV and other MMOs combat systems is still inferior to what GW2 has and many see it just as a massive wasted 
---
potential that anet use the best combat system in the industry for mindless 1111 boss farms/fights.
---
Same as WvW ... theirs nothing which comes close to the larger scale battles you can have here and anet just completely neglects this game mode, with zero support.
---
You know ... you can have both, offer content for more committed / veteran players with long term progression.
---
And openworld / story content for casual gamers who only play 2h per week and hates to play with other players in coordinated groups and rather login only for the story every 3 months.
---
The resources you would need are not out of proportions, if gw2 would get over is mismanagement of their dev time they could reuse assets, like giving us the epic PoF endbattle story instance as a fractal/dungeon.
---
Or make very basic versions of difficulty ratings for raids, adjusting some numbers for an easy mode shouldn't be that hard and time consuming.
---
I mean like left due to how repetive it is and there were a lot of things I heared seem good or it seem bad by other people I just wanted to know if it was worth the time coming back to it
---
And when you do come back, your ascendeds will still be ascended and your legendaries will still be legendary. You won‚Äôt be playing ‚Äúcatch up‚Äù and missing out on all the fun in the latest good content just because you took a break.
---
I used to frustrate myself when I was repeating myself in an argument, but now I made a habit to just stop engaging with the person if I felt that they are not reading what has been discussed until the point. Saves a lot of stress
---
Nope. Not with the companies current way of engaging with their longstanding supporters.
---
If you want a game inwhich a company makes you feel you are just a marketing toy go for it.
---
This is how I feel now as a player who played since GW: Prophecies (2005) and feels now.
---
BUT
---
if you are a player looking for a story then I recommend playing GW1 (GW: Factions best expansion delivered ever .) and then GW2, although some of the writing after GW2 Season 3 is kinda average. Generally speaking the writing in GW2 does not come close to the depth that Guild Wars had. Specifically Guild Wars: Factions inwhich you had several sidestories to venture through.   
---
I am hoping Guild Wars 2: Icebrood Saga will deliver many background stories in preparation for a huge expansion like Cantha or maybe something completely new and vast but I am really doubting it.
---
yep.. she ate yoko and boom krallk kills hers.. and oh what a surprise.. lich magic ressurection. how the fuck couldnt people see this?
---
&gt; SO after 3 days without fixing or at least disabling it in game, I assume its intended.
---
Weekends are a thing. Besides it wouldn't be the first time they suddenly decide something is 100% not okay *months* after it was first discovered.
---
&gt; Bethesda expansions are underwhelming, to say the least - comparable to a full LS season in my opinion. Anyway, Anet is not going to give details on the expansion now - it's too early and would give away LS5. They don't have the content to give a 10-20 second tease, especially not without spoiling LS content. Plus, the community obviously wouldn't be able to handle it - not 1-1.5 years in advance when so much is STILL subject to change. Look at how they handled changes to scope and deliverables in the past.
---
I think you missed the point. Bethesda announced next ES title with 10 second trailer and basically nothing more, that's what that remark was aimed at. I assume that you were referring to ESO, that's Zenimax not Bethesda. 
---
&gt; But we already know that an expac is in the works. It's a 3+ year process, so it's a given.
---
Well you must be some kind of physic or something because nobody else knows that its in the works and the developers haven't mentioned it before. There are speculations that they might not do another expansion at all and will stick with saga/ls. 
---
&gt; This is definitely not concerning enough to be having an ongoing tantrum over it, unless people really have nothing better to do.
---
Yea, that's fairly ignorant statement. Your life doesn't need to "hinge" on gw2 for you to care about it. With this kind of logic we should just borderline cancel social media because disusing games and other pop-culture stuff is not concerning enough and people should find "better things to do". I am also not sure in which world does "being disappointed/losing faith and discussing/sharing an opinion" equal to "having a tantrum". Give me a break fam.
---
P.S.: i was thinking of buying it from plinstant-gaming, its not a site like g2a or kinguin;not sure if it authorised by arenanet
---
That would be a dumb thing to say. Good thing I didn't.
---
isn't it an eagle? XD
---
I was taking an average, since some times they were on once a year, other times twice a year but recently they've been on more frequently but I didn't want to lie and say they are on every 3/4 months when that might not be the case :)
---
üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
---
A mistake.
---
They only said Far Shiverpeaks for Ep1 iirc. Nothing keeps Drakkar from having moved in 250 years. Furthermore, this may be a coincidence by Drakkar's look in the GW2 concept art resembles the ice pillar creature from GW1 while Jormag GW2 concept art resembles Drakkar from GW1. It may occur that they retcon Drakkar into not being the creature from under the lake but the creature atop the frozen pillar and make Jormag the creature under the lake. I hope not though.
---
I'm rather doubtful they'll move Primordus back to the Far Shiverpeaks after taking time to shove him into the Ring of Fire. Or necessarily have them fight (since that would be very cataclysmic).
---
I'm also questioning the length of the icebrood saga. Every ED has gotten at least an expansion and 4 LW episodes worth. Jormag only getting less than half that seems... Bad. And the name "Icebrood Saga" makes me wonder: if its just a name for Season 5, why not just call it "The Jormag Saga" or "The Ice Dragon Saga". This makes me think Jormag isn't the end goal but a looming presence, similar to Mordremoth during S2. Which makes me hopeful we face Drakkar repeatedly as we did the Shadow of the Dragon.
---
yes, that's literally what you just said. you are mad that she's calling out industry wide toxicity before the team has finished their response.
---
Yeah, sorry, but 
---
1) I am Russian. Not American. Omsk is the name of my city. 
---
2) Whether the customer base is right or wrong is irrelevant. The fact is that your customer base is a given, it is part of your environment. Your audience is what it is. If you want to change it - then do something about it, whining that it's bad never helps. 
---
Only the company or very strong opinion leaders can be the agent of meaningful change. Not the audience itself.
---
Yeah, I made [this concept](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/879ul9/mapping_out_a_possible_blood_legion_homelands_far/) a year and a half ago. Back when we though an expansion was coming after LWS4.
---
Can't predict how things would be; but we can say with certainty that the current affairs aren't great.

He flies to the pylon and spins in a circle. ~0.5 seconds after he finishes spinning the knockback wave comes out.

The finished herbs, people with a lot of alt accounts can log in and gather all the HI, can't it? It is easy brainless money where you can get like 100g for 20 alts

---
oh so that's why you're a raging dipshit
---
I wish that they'll eventually make new maps more connected to core Tyria
---
I saw this exact picture yesterday.
---
&gt; It may occur that they retcon Drakkar into not being the creature from under the lake but the creature atop the frozen pillar and make Jormag the creature under the lake. 
---
I don't think they will, they said something about how in GW1 you'd only see Drakkar under the lake, whereas in GW2 you'd interact with him.
---
Is this a serious complaint ? It cant be right ?
---
That's literally it (sort of, they wanted the content of an expanion - new character build options, but we will only get more story instead).
---
Use DLGamer.  Its an official retailer and PoF is $20
---
They actually confirmed that Ep. 2 will be set on the same map as Ep. 1. "But yeah, so there's going to be a dynamic growth of the map between episode one and two."
---
I hope we don't actually defeat Jormag by the end, but I would imagine we'll encounter him in some capacity, perhaps like we encountered Primordus in LWS3.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cxuwk6/mapping_out_a_possible_path_for_the_icebrood_saga/

It was yours.

yes, i explained it in this post in more depth:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cyojmr/guide_how_to_supply_your_guildsquad_with_cheap/
---
For some reason, it says it can be activated in my country, even though im not from US
---
some who play this game and are active on the forums seem unable to understand that we have a responsibility to challenge the devs to make their customers happy, just like they constantly challenge us to remain so. no one else will challenge their reason for existing in this way because we are the only ones who play their game. what we are not responsible for is worrying about the imagined feelings of anet employees who don't even make the decisions being criticized, and have no reason to be offended. this isn't 3rd grade art class where everyone gets a star for handing something in. even then, when the teacher messes up it's not the students' fault.
---
I assume the Blood Citadel will kinda be the Amnoon of this season.
---
The only part of HoT that I feel was its biggest problem were the maps themselves before PoF. Metas that needed to be completed to reach chunks of the map, confusing tunnel systems that are hard to understand at first, and being locked out of locations even after you unlocked them because the meta reset. 
---
Luckily the addition of mounts in PoF lessened that considerably, as you can bypass a lot of the barriers that are there with them and get around the maps much easier (with the exception of the still confusing Tangled Depths).
---
Someones gotta do it. They sure didnt. 
---
My thoughts as to what a Saga means. I think it means they will jump stories around from release to release. This time it Charr and Norn, Next time some other different thing with Asura.
---
I dropped GW2 for FF14 a bit ago. All I really enjoyed in GW was the WvW system but that never got much support and eventually I gave up. I'm enjoying FF14 a lot and I feel more invested in the story than I ever did with GW. The FF14 world just feels richer. You can't really compare the combat systems between the two so I won't. I also really enjoy gear progression in FF14. It made me realize how little of that there was in GW2 and how much I missed something like it in my gameplay.
---
The fact that I was only logging into WoW and FFXIV  to do my dailies and weeklies as quickly as possible with a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get this over with‚Äù attitude just so I could keep up with the latest gear and then log out is what ultimately drove me to quit, take a year long hiatus from playing any MMOs and then ultimately deciding to give GW2 a second shot since hating it at launch. 
---
The thing is I want to play an MMO and that‚Äôs what GW2 is, a full fledged MMO
---
What I don‚Äôt want to play is a gigantic lobby where I‚Äôm just waiting for my queue to pop so I can do the same mindless raids with a toxic community that uses shit to track what YOUR damage output instead of worrying about the shit damage they‚Äôre doing. Rinse and repeat.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs what the ‚Äúhardcore community‚Äù wants, but that‚Äôs not the guildwars I want to play.
---
Making them heavily reliant on having legendary gear would be the dumbest decision they've ever made.
---
That said I also feel like that's exactly what they're going to do, that and monetize them too heavily.
---
It'll be the worst blow up since they added ascended gear.
---
5 years ago the record for a 5 man run was 10:46. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E532fFj_cHI
---
Now, a solo run is less than 3 minutes slower. A good solo back then would have been sub 25 minutes. The game has really progressed.
---
Both of my missing ones were two of the party masks. For the first one, without knowing that I'd get a second one, I just picked the first one on the list that I didn't have unlocked. I figured I'm not ever going to use either one anyway, so it really doesn't matter.
---
I'm glad you mentioned it because it really puts me at ease for the design changes. I was a little put off by the concept art (it looks based on the Mordrem vine tooth model) instead of the leviathan turtle with a long neck that I envisioned drakkar to be. But since this model has some place in the lore, maybe Drakkar is just a name given by the Norn/Jotun/Kodan (since theres a drakkar Spurs location in Frostgorge Sound as well)
---
The context was "random mob pulling you back". It doesn't matter what type they are.
---
Those are some tiny maps
---
All of my characters have difficult to get armor skins that I worked hard for and flaunt. I haven‚Äôt spent a single gem on armor skins.
---
Outfits are cool and all but they‚Äôre ultra accessible for people who want them. Personally I prefer the freedom to mix and match armor sets I unlocked myself.
---
&gt; Every ED has gotten at least an expansion and 4 LW episodes worth.
---
Except Kralk because it was focused on Balthazar.
---
That's the thing.
---
All other approved tools are approved for everyone. They can't go around bending the rules for some players and not others. One thing is giving them some benefits, but another is making exception to rules for them.
---
[ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/artwork/brxKG)
---
I certainly hope they connect to each other and existing maps more than that! And there‚Äôs very little chance that in the middle of all this, primordus will just randomly appear again underground having moved all the way across the world again
---
They're as large as Frostgorge Sound, one of the biggest core Tyria maps! Except for the Battledepths of course, but being underground, I imagine it would have a lot of verticality.
---
The keys are universal except in China
---
He's clearly using Dragonhunter.....
---
This was kinda mesmerizing to watch.
---
Dude, again, we have a different definition of 'rewarding'. I'm not saying you can't be upset, I'm just saying to please not call me a moron if I am not.
---
Idc how easy or difficult or 'casual' these Strike missions are going to be.
---
I've been itching for instanced open-world group content for months now after how much I enjoyed the Dragon Bash Dragon Arena. I hope we get some 5-man versions of Strike missions, though.
---
I just got the heart of thorns veteran pack and was looking through the skins. Some of the helm skins mention being one-time use and don't say anything about unlocking the wardrobe option like they usually do. Are those options not unlocked in the wardrobe if I choose them like pretty much every other skin item I've seen in the game?
---
Then they should say that explicitly. Instead they‚Äôve said ‚Äúyeah we want to increase the raid release cadence it‚Äôs going to happen‚Äù literally over and over. Not joking they‚Äôve said this MULTIPLE times after they initially promised many raids per year. So instead they don‚Äôt want to lose people so they try to string them along and milk them as much as possible before their lack of actual content causes people to leave. It‚Äôs malicious or borderline malicious and they know exactly what they‚Äôre doing
---
While I dont disagree, Sagas do that sometimes. It Might follow another character doing something else for a while somewhere else that can contribute to the main story and a way not known.
---
Every game is repetive, especially mmos. WoW is repetitive, Black Desert is repetitive, Warframe is repetitive. Hell, LoL and Dota are repetitive, Hearthstone and Overwatch are repetitive beyond belief. Call of Duty, Counterstrike and PubG are all also repetitive. You either like what you do and play or you dont, but having repetitivness as a complaint in games is just stupid.
---
You will always be able to play through content faster than its possible to produce it. Some games take 6 years to be made, only for us to complete them in a weekend... You should appreaciate a bit more what is being offered to you.
---
Its growing so much that you sit on /r/guildwars2 all day trying to recruit people into your anime game?
---
Question while I have your attention. By "world things" do you mean lore for the personal story? or do you mean  just boss events and such, because once youve killed one King/ lord of a territory, youve killed them all.
---
Denial is a powerful thing.
---
Very interesting mister arbiter of intellectuality
---
Ah, that version is much smoother on my system, than the one a few months ago, which is fantastic.
---
Still some getting used to, but it's clearly an increase in performance
---
That's not an introduction to raids, that's just raids. It needs versions of raid mechanics that are not punishing, but clear enough to practice on, in order to be an effective intro to raids.
---
You say this and completely ignore the focus on spvp, wvwvw, and esports that were the start of the game. wvwvw itself was almost a carbon copy of dark ages of camelot which was a serious mmo.
---
it was marketed as horizontal progression, which does not mean casual. but recently people have been claiming this to cover the fact that anet is putting this game on maintenance mode for everything but casual players.
---
because I enjoy a fantasy setting with my group of friends as we raid dungeons and group up to pvp with beautifull characters weve put the perfect costumes on. Next question
---
My main reason for posting was to try and get some conversation going that's not about the recent drama.
---
Slightly serious in that I don't like racing games, but not something I'd normally make a whole post about.
---
Its called shilling.
---
Isn't that normal when the person in questions is also checking off the box for "human garbage" too?
---
I am a 500 lvl cook and I have no guild and I just put my food when I see a lot of people around.
---
 Also, before ascended cooking I discovered every possible recipe because I was bored.
---
I actually wish they would do this, but I don't expect it.
---
Article seems fine, but first comment made me wish world ended in 2012.
---
Which isn‚Äôt an issue for you ofc because you‚Äôre just going to milk them like you milk the rest of the player base every time Anet adds ‚Äúcooking 500‚Äù or any sort of market changes. 
---
Let‚Äôs face it communities are dying (I see it personally) and you‚Äôll be unaffected since your chosen game mode will always exist as long as there are players to buy your shit. 
---
Easy to not care about something when it doesn‚Äôt affect you.
---
Anyone who legit expected elite specs is naive.
---
Same thing goes for cheaters, anets cheat detection is pretty shite, only thing that can get rid of em is mass reporting by the community
---
Thanks for this. I've been trying to take my first steps into communicating on this subreddit, but I couldn't quite articulate my thoughts. Some people claim not to have expectations, but then say they are disappointed. The definition of disappointment is the negative emotions of not having hopes or expectations fulfilled, and some people don't get that.
---
With the announcement, I think there were also expectations because it was a live announcement. I think the most important result of the announcement was that it did not communicate the state of the game or anet as a company. After the layoffs and new game director, the image of the game and company is somewhat nebulous. We don't know what to expect, so there's all sorts of dissonance when **any** expectations aren't met, and there's few signs that they will be addressed.
---
However I don't believe a "spiraling shithole of negativity" is a reasonable response. There is a lot of negativity not only towards anet, but even towards less negative users on the subreddit trying to have meaningful discussion. It creates a polarized community, where nonconstructive posts and "discussions" are the most visible. 
---
I believe the subreddit is recovering from the initial shock of unaddressed expectations, and is steering towards more constructive discussion. The biggest issue in my opinion is clear communication from anet, and I am starting to see posts in this subreddit addressing that. If I remember correctly, there was a similar trend during the Heart of Thorns launch: initial shock, leading to a desire for communication.
---
I don't believe the "white knights" as some users put it are trying to defend anet, but are rather trying to preserve a healthy environment for discussion. When users start attacking other users, then that causes users to get defensive and nothing is accomplished.
---
right; I can see the narrative demanding it though; as he's destined to defeat jormag I would not be surprised if he somehow has to merge with the spirits of the wild (we've seen Owl or Raven in the trailer having become corrupted) so he has to sacrifice himself to do a thing.
---
with his growing from angsty teen to caring uncle-figure to Taimi n all that; him sacrificing himself a-la Tybalt/Sieran/Forgal would close out his story.
---
isn't that an "expansion like" feature?
---
What is point posting what other players say on the forum if it is interesting for you write there.
---
In context of anet marketing around LW since last year, elite specs was the most reasonable and on the ground expectation this community could have.
---
Hm. It what you write would be true, ppl would still stuck at fractals T1 but they learn and slowly progress. Some will stuck at 2&amp;3 but a lot will come to T4 and know how to handle things. There are also challenge mods.
---
I simple don't have the time for raids, not the difficulty and I believe that's true for a lot of ppl. Nearly every one I know does fractals T4 but only a handful do raids because of the time investment and hard entry. Training raids are ok but find one spontaneous when you have time is hard.
---
There‚Äôs lots of new things to play if you come back, in all game modes. If you want to play that stuff once and never look back, it will still take you a long time. 
---
Things like, expansions, elite specs, LS maps and story, pvp maps, mounts and gliding, new fractals and raids, new collections, new skins, etc.
---
At the very least look up the stuff that is new to you and see if it sounds cool.
---
Sorry, 500,000 comments in the sea of 1,000,000,000 other comments. There now you can address my example and DO THE MATH
---
Indeed
---
&gt;‚ÄúWe love the game! We‚Äôre not toxic jerks, we‚Äôre Nice Guys. And we want to know exactly what you‚Äôre doing all the time and if you don‚Äôt do exactly what we want you to do we‚Äôre leaving and you‚Äôre dead without us.‚Äù
---
That is one massive strawman
---
&gt; Any dev can respond to that without being at risk of speaking for the company.
---
In one of your dream worlds maybe. If one of those devs starts to insult people most companies either gonne reprimand them or will try to get rid of them, cuz they will cost them money and create bad publicity. 
---
Why is it so hard to understand that you're bound to your company when you talk shit/insult someone. Why do you think most people that are doing the insulting are using accounts with handles and not their real names?
---
The standard behavior of the garden plots was always that you could share them with other players indefinitely, so long as you (the owner) did not harvest them that day. This applied to the ascended plants for at least the first two days after the update that added them, but I haven't shared them since then, so OP's experience may be ArenaNet's stealth response.
---
Well, you should tell that to *him* and not to us? I mean there is no reason to call this thread out in another forum. Just answer him, if you want to... you know, answer him.
---
was anything they showed "expansion level content"? guess they're saving that stuff for when they rent out a theater for their next blog post about episode 1
---
There are actually a ton of people who think that the ‚Äûcasualness‚Äú of gw2 is a bad thing, because they want to grind and all that stuff. I heard it so many times.
---
For me that‚Äôs exactly the reason i love gw2 so much. There are so many other mmorpgs which are so grindy it‚Äôs not funny anymore. 
---
If you don‚Äôt like it then don‚Äôt play it, it‚Äôs as simple as that. Gw2 is one of the only games that are made for our play style and it‚Äôs such a good game, it has exactly the stuff I search in a mmo.
---
I love to just complete the world exploration, finish achievements and collections and not have to worry about some gear that is nearly impossible to get.
---
You can begin by not lying.
---
WvW was always fun when I would play with friends
---
I'm convinced Wube are just robots masquerading as humans. There's no ways mere humans can be so fast and so insanely competent at making such a deep and complex game.
---
Psst, your 500 gems will be shipped soon, hail ArenaNet and hail Hydra.
---
Using memes in their article. Must be a serious one.
---
This, so much this.
---
I talk shit whenever Anet does something silly but that's all memes and jokes for fun. I've long ago accepted that they will never do what I personally want from them and that my favourite game mode is going to be forever neglected....And that's OK, I still enjoy it for what it is, in its present state. Other friends and guildies have mostly left...And that's always sad, to see another person disappear... but it is how it is.
---
Also the fact that you scale down to whatever zone you are in so there's not really a stomping effect when going back to clear like in WoW
---
I see where you're coming from but I don't think something like "We know there are some misunderstandings therefore we will have some news early next week" would have been that much of a trouble for them. Also it's not unusual for a company to release some statement if they messed up or if there is an uproar (and yes, even if it's a day on the weekend).
---
Expansions (together with eltie specs) were released every 2 year (HoT - 2015, PoF - 2017). Now is 2019. *Anet rented a stage, made an early announcement about announcement that is a month away, created live stream with countdown, which all made a huge hype train which crashed badly because of terrible announcement with lack of information and useless merchandise advertising*. There was a pretty good reason to expect elite specs since the time gap between new elite specs matches and the big announcement event is made for something "important".
---
Oh you mean just like how it was for anybody who said anything negative for literal years? 
---
Oh but NOW it's problematic and toxic x) 
---
Check yourself
---
&gt; buy gems
---
&gt; Your money will be used to
---
&gt;  make new outfits
---
&gt;  mount skins
---
Buy gemstore skins so Anet can make more gemstore skins, amazing!
---
I've spent quite a lot of grinding for Fashion Wars myself, but these last few months the ratio of quality&amp;quantity of gemstore skins vs in-game rewards has gotten even worse. The best looking skins are gemstore exclusive (if they aren't Black Lion Chest exclusive), with dyable particle effects, 4 dye slots, high rez textures, compared to older skins. I'm talking about skins like the Pyre gloves, the Mist-Stranger outfit, the most recent celestial themed outfit which has much better textures than the celestial infusion. 
---
Meanwhile, Legendary Armor is still waiting for an update, and people have been asking for some of the simpler glider/mount skin designs to be added as in-game rewards for ages. One of the simpler mount skins, for example, could be available for purchase for elegy mosaics or when completing a PoF's map meta-achievement (or both ) to promote replayability and longevity in these maps ( 1 Raptor skin from Crystal Oasis, 1 Springer skin from Desert Highlands etc.) Similarly with HoT map currencies and gliders.
---
what is it with all these barely used but years old reddit account popping up right now here, that all only have very few comments under their hood, and all of them are, for the most part, oddly formally phrased...
---
Industry, reaping+consortium (or quickness) are good if you're on the move, most mobs are too slow to hit you before you re-mount even if they're sitting right on top of the node. [According to the wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gathering#Notes_on_additional_strikes) extra strikes are supposedly capped at +3 even though I could swear I've gotten more in the past. Then again we used to get extra strikes on Rich nodes back when WvW Mist War bonuses were a thing. Assuming the wiki to be correct the yields are reduced *slightly:*
---
* A single +33% boost will still yield almost 50% extra (47.5% down from 49.3%)
---
* Two independent 33% boosts will yield 106% extra (down from 130%, also *d'oh* for forgetting to invert the combined probability in my previous post!)
---
* A 66% boost will yield 138% extra, down from 194%
---
To the less mathematically inclined, these series for repeat rolls are **always** heavily weighted towards the first few rounds unless there is a finite pool of returns you can eventually exhaust. Forcing a hard cap would mainly serve as a safeguard against bots (silicon *or* flesh hardware...) in case they ever screw up and implement a proc chance of 100%.
---
Yes, sure, I easily agree on this.
---
Only if you play casually though. If you like party content, good luck finding new finds every time you come back...
---
Ironically, a single of their Devstreams generally has more content than ANet's "huge" reveal event.
---
&gt; I cannont even sit on a chair
---
you might want to check out No Man's Sky, they recently added that wonderful feature
---
...unless those specific developers made objectively bad moves.
---
Like Jay Wilson from Blizzard - fuck that loser in particular.
---
I‚Äôm a lurker, I have no need to post or respond to threads. More than likely my response has already been on a thread. Don‚Äôt overthink a reddit post, that‚Äôs dangerous.
---
I don't think we will see too much of primordus. They are putting a focus on Jormags character to bring in primordus would distract from jormag. Also it is called the icebrood saga which suggests they will be front and center. And early on people speculated that the red on the logo was to do with primordus but that could be the flame legion since we know charr will also have a larger role this season and we have seen icebrood charr or it is the reddish-purple from PoF/Ls4 and it is a design to show the progressive move away from PoF and ls4 to something next, with a blue logo.
---
I disagree. ANet's actually got a pretty tightly integrated internationalization team, I'd say feedback is probably taken into account equally for all officially supported languages.
---
The problem's that it's all equally mediocre most of the time.
---
HAIL HYDRA
---
What news? Should they just magically come up with news? 
---
The thing is every single thing they say will be picked apart into tiny pieces, analyzed and used against them, so they will stay quiet until they have formulated something in an overly clear way.
---
I think most people don't think about that. 
---
I mean the internet is availabe all the time, so is this sub and the game. People play GW2 in their free time. It's easy to forget that there are real people with regular working hours on the other end.
---
This is the reason I‚Äôve kept playing and keep coming back!
---
My intention wasn't to compare the games or their roadmaps but more the activity of the developers with the community.
---
Both did or still do communicate with the playerbase but had a very different outcome.
---
No one has been in the office -&gt; no one is at work to draft an official reply from company media accounts. You certainly don't want to post anything from home, as we've seen already, and the company can't make an official statement without a meeting with marketing/PR.
---
&gt; Because often I would find myself in the middle of the quest and just after I finish it find some info on what I just did. Breaks immersion a bit.
---
Informations related to the mission or dynamic event you're currently doing (dynamic events are the green circles that pop on the mini-map) will display on the top right corner of your screen. It should show you goals, objectives and needed information about your current mission.
---
GW2 model eliminates the need to talk to NPCs before and after quests. All you have to do is to enter the region where said mission is active and perform the goals displayed on your screen.
---
As for which one you should do, the idea behind the game is: explore the world and be rewarded. So, basically, do map completion until you hit the desired level. Yes, I know, map is boring. Doing hearts is boring (tbf, some of them are kinda fun, and I love doing vistas). Any kind of exploration will award you EXP: finding new areas, points of interest, vistas, hero challenges (a.k.a. Hero Points, a.k.a. HPs) and hearts. It is possible to level up without doing a single heart. Even crafting gives you EXP.
---
In case you dislike doing any kind of map completion, you can also level up through World Vs World and PvP, if those are more in line with what you like. 
---
If everything else fails, you can level up by killing random yellow-named mobs (the non-aggressive ones, those give lots of EXP).
---
Think about this game like our real world: there are plenty of options, you choose what you want to do.
---
&gt; People find some thing (skin, item) they like, they go on collecting stuff, throughout a long term journey you make it!
---
"So.. if I pull doubles at work for the next two weeks, I might be able to afford the permanent bank."  /s
---
it's very similar, however there are prevalent lag issues (if you aren't from EU or NA and on the right server, don't even bother. sorry not sorry oceania / literally anywhere that isn't NA or EU) and of course the ever present balance issues associated with pvp.
---
You could put in multiple love interests. And even then, you'll never make everyone happy. But that's life.
---
Commencing.
---
Tell him that balance patches come once every 3-4 months, fractals get added about 1-2 a year, raids come out once every 9+ months. And that pvp and wvw have stayed the same for the past 2+ years but new content is coming "soon".
---
game journalism in current year. Take all your content from reddit and youtube and regurgitate it into some semblance of an article. Oh and of course can't forget to spend 80% of your hit piece bitching about toxic gamers and death threats without so much as a shred of evidence.
---
I'm happy with what i've gotten out of this game but it's clear the developers and publisher don't believe in the game anymore and just want to do maintenance mode from here out. Other devs and publishers aren't satisfied with that and they will likely continue to do more and get more of the players away from GW2 in the future because it. Like I said, this game doesn't exist in a vacuum and it won't survive long term if they continue to not communicate and not add content that new and old players alike can get really excited about.
---
I fear they¬°re retconning that one. Why would Bangar be north then?
---
Kinda sad the Blood Legion isn't getting its own architecture too; assuming Grothmar is actually Blood Legion territory, of course.
---
I expected Daredevil auto lol :D
---
&gt;Strike missions
---
It's just one, not a plural there.
---
&gt;World boss
---
Deathbranded Shatt is a "world boss" so I guess that episode was expansion like too.
---
&gt;Improving masteries
---
Improving how?, I don't recall anything about them improving masteries, just adding new ones as with every LS episode before.
---
*Carefully folds a little pirate hat out of papery product with chromatic shine*

Here you go, enjoy =)
---
well, tbh when u stop playing Gw2 u rarly find a reason to come back, u can play the entriere game with out the neat of a guild, theres litterely very few reasons to even come back.
---
This. There is no training group on LFG that is willing to teach / carry you? Fine, make your own and figure stuff out with people that are just as inexperienced as you! Dont expect to be carried or oneshot Raid encounters. It takes commitment. My first 20 LI where an absolute pain to get, but I pushed trough and now that I am at 500+ and all KP, I dont have problems anymore, sure, because I have experience and know what to do instead of slacking around ;)
---
The [gearing guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) linked in my general guide is really helpful with getting exotics and ascended, I'd suggest getting a cheap set of [Devona's armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Devona%27s_armor) off the trading post for a few gold a piece. It comes with runes built in and is the fastest cheap way of getting the armor you want.
---
&gt;I've enough skill points for dragonhunter when I reach lvl 80
---
Getting to level 80 gets you 398 points from level up rewards which is enough to get every single base skill and trait unlocked. The elite specializations require 250 additional hero points on top of needing all other base skills unlocked. If you grabbed ever hero point in the base game + WvW you'd end up with 214, below the 250 you would need. Good news is that each hero challenge in both expansions rewards 10x the points and there are a ton available to get.
---
So is this what passes for journalism these days? Seems like a bit of a joke. They might want to proofread the article too before posting it.
---
all what you said is true and if someone who was gone for a year+ came and expected these, id understand. but after the statements made by ane since announcing s5 about s5, i dont get how you could unless you were just really optimistic.
---
&gt; How many players in the game?
---
We don't have an actual player count, but there are enough so you won't feel like the game is empty
---
&gt; And do I have to buy 2 expansion packs to play the game?
---
Play the game, no, the core game is free to play with some social restrictions. You only need the expansions if you want to remove these restrictions and to explore expansion content, but all the core game (pretty much what we had when the game came out) is all free. You also only need to buy Path of Fire, since Heart of Thorns comes bundled in with it now.
---
The game does not lack depth at all, it has several different game modes in end game which you can always keep yourself busy with. Raids, fractals, open world, pvp, wvw, etc. 
---
It‚Äôs very easy to switch between the game modes and find what you like. It‚Äôs really worthwhile to try it out.  
---
I suggest trying out some dungeons or world  bosses with him in core to show him the game. Those parts are free, what do you have to lose?
---
It's a great example. Say what you will about WildStar, but it significantly raised the bar when it comes to player-owned houses in video games.

Well, that is what gw2 always was. A collection game. That is the reason for many of those early "I am 80 but what can I do now" posts. The implementation of collections itself made it more apparent for many players and the implementation of raids as well as a shifting focus to fractals over dungeons was implying a shift in direction for others not satisfied with playing a collection game. These are the players that are now mad at the game because Anet flirtet with the idea of trying a more traditional mmo thingy but ultimatively decided to stick to their roots. Mostly because it needs way less time to design new collectables than new raids and fractals. I can understand both sides. Luckily for me I am quite fine with a collection game and getting my dose of challenging content elsweyr.
---
So they should rather stay silent and let theire employees rage about the community on theire private social media accounts. Ok.
---
I'm also followings a few other games and even the smallest studios are able to release news/statements on the weekend. I really don't see the problem here to tell an employee to post something before things escalate. It doesn't take a day to do so.
---
We have a different view on how they could have handled the situation and I respect that but I see this discussion going nowhere therefore I'm going to stop here.
---
Does anyone know how long the buy one get one free expansion promo is on for? 
---
I'm returning to the game after a long time away and I'm  not sure if I will be dedicating as much time as I think I will to it.
---
I dont want to buy the expansions preemptively,  but I also don't want to miss out on the deal. üò¨
---
on the contrary, it seems incredibly biased towards the side of a certain company. if so many people weren't disappointed or still stuck around this long to voice their disappointment, they could and would get away with an even bigger kiss on anets ass. it's full of the not so subtle opinion "journalism" that has become so prevalent these days.
---
&gt; let theire employees rage about the community
---
That's not what's happening. You know that's not what's happening. No-one can treat you like a calm, reasonable adult when you say stupid shit like that.
---
Forever, if you buy PoF you will now always get HoT bundled in

I highly doubt we will see a primordus / jormag showdown. I set my gold on a more jormag + sebbulb driven saga with primordus as an distant antagonist to jormag itself.

Companies purposely manipulate you into thinking excessive spending in the cash shop is "okay" because it means "supporting the game".
---
Forums OP got played hard. But they might be too stubborn to admit it. So if they get called out, they may be in the denial stage.
---
I like how you copy and paste this on threads.....what difference does it make whether it‚Äôs a new/old reddit account or not?
---
Bang on. The vast majority of content released is instanced one-and-done singleplayer stuff, with a sprinkling of pseudo-multiplayer content alongside it in the form of open world. I don't play MMOs for a watered-down singleplayer story once every quarter, I play them to interact with other people.
---
TL;DR: invite people to gather in your home instance
---
What you are missing is that you can PvP at any level without penalty (you get the same gear as everyone else) and at 80 you will most likely do "the same hearts and events over and over again".
---
While leveling you don't do the same heart twice since they don't reset daily.
---
So the only reason to boost is if you really like the class you are on and want to skip ahead to the fashion wars part.
---
Eh there's still a stomping effect. A full ascended berserker level 80 warrior downscaled in queensdale is still going to rip through mobs and events far better than a level 5 character would.
---
Considering the evidence non-PC versions seem much more likely to be their canceled projects they tried to put money into rather than what they are trying to release. Ex: mobile art leaks and NCsoft statement
---
Well, maybe the idea to make such an announcement on Friday wasn't the brightest idea in the first place. I also don't get it that they release new stuff at the end of the week when it is absolutely foreseeable that bugs will show up and people need to fix that asap. This is just stupid.
---
Maybe they announced the only thing they have to offer? This might just be the best they can do for now. Can't shed light on what doesn't exist.
---
Funny thing, someone took Corbin Fisher in game :C
---
what? i didn't see anyone making death threats or wishing people to be fired, unless of course you are talking about comments at the bottom of threads that had been downvoted to oblivion, of which there were a couple. people were making sarcastic jokes (not toxic), expressing their disappointment (not toxic), asking anet for a change/ news / anything (not toxic) etc. labelling them all as toxic just takes away from what little credibility you have as everyone can see that what you claim *is not true*.
---
Yes, I see this in tv as well. The especially messed up part about this in gaming is companies switched to live services models because they specifically wanted to "engage" more. They insist "engage" doesn't mean money, that it actually means engage, but then get mad when that engaging happens. Doesn't make sense. If you don't want to talk to us, make a single player RPG with no expansions or added content. Charge us 60 bucks and everyone can go about their business. I honestly believe some companies need to do this more.
---
A strong likelihood since we got icebrood charr in the trailer. I was just saying "closest scenario to the trailer ending".
---
Dwarves would be much, much more Primordus and Depths rather than far Shiverpeaks. They'd make a lot more sense in an underground/Primordus expansion. Jormag Primordus showdown would be the perfect leadup.
---
They can shed light on situation. There is nothing wrong in cancelling projects and delaying content release, if you communicate it properly. Anet doesn't communicate. If they explained what and why happened that would help fighting the frustration. Meanwhile we're all surrounded by uncertainity, assumptions, gossips and accusations.
---
i highly doubt it, anet has been making bad decisions on their own just fine. ncsoft may be greedy but they aren't stupid, sadly the same cannot be said for anet. anyone could have seen what the outcome of this would have been if you had inside information, especially given the last couple months / years of mismanagement.
---
question - if we dont get LW seasons but get nothing and then LS3 as expnasion 2, PoF as expansion 3, LS4 as expansion 4 with all maps, story, raids, fractals etc - would you be more happy?
---
I mean we would get several months(around year and half) nothing and then 6 new maps, great story, lots of achivs, skins etc. Would that be better or not? 
---
Cause as much as people tring to say LS releases are lame- they give more content each map then for example HoT or PoF maps ever give.
---
"Overestimate" but I see what you are meaning. That being said, based on your description I'd have to say you probably still play too much based on that. I recently brought a friend into the game and he was refunded 2400 gems for his purchase of HoT. Instead of getting something useful like unbreakable gathering tools or an infinite basic salvage kit, he converted it to gold and power leveled he Armorsmithing to 500 in a matter of hours, with about 200 gold left over. It's his money and he can do what he wants with it, but it occurred to me that it is not easy to max a craft in a day. He paid a large amount of gold to max it out, but what if he had to farm those materials himself, and physically harvesting aside he'd have to journey out to all the locations to actually get the materials from the nodes. This would take several multi-hour play sessions. This is not accomplished in a day. And that just a specific example. PvP is never really boring so long as you have challenging opponents. You are looking at it in more of a "reward for time" idea but I look at it as more of a reward in of itself. I enjoy the rush of dismantling my enemy or the fear of being overwhelmed by the same. I do agree that wvw needs help because that's a more open world style PvP and open world PvP needs people to populate it to be enjoyed, which means they need to be motivated. You can still get fun, spontaneous small fights over minor objectives in wvw, but it definitely needs more people. I come from Eve Online and I have to tell you that the PvP in this game is so much more rewarding and balanced. If I just could keep a solid team, I'd be hard pressed to leave the PvP area.
---
But I'm rambling a bit. I don't have the ability to play every day and when I do play I feel like I'm barely getting anything done compared to everything I have left to do. I've been playing for 7 years, and I still haven't done every path of the old dungeons, I've barely scratched fractals, I've never done a raid, I have almost all the Hot masteries to finish, I've never gotten 100% world completion on a single character, and I've only played through the story on one character. I have alot left to do. Perhaps our playtime our the difference? I have a total of about 750 hours in the game. What do you have?
---
One can easily spot players who don't play CS or WoT - by their lack of knowledge about toxicity ;-)
---
The other way round, one can relax about the calm comments in here :-)
---
No, you just have to buy Path of Fire ($30). The core game is free itself but you can't map chat and you can only whisper players on your map. If you need to buy something from the Trading Post/Auction House, ask another player, most players are willing to help out.
---
Well I kind of mean a story that seemly has nothing to do with the main story line with another place or another set of characters that in the end somehow tie into it all.
---
So another Season 3?
---
as opposed to the  circle jerk of "whats your favourite quaggan?" or "i just finished my legendary" or "i took this picture of map completion on my shitty camera phone". yeah, you are right, that is pointless.
---
Has anyone seen death threads being posted here?
---
You gotta address them readers &lt; 25 ...
---
Yes, but those statements were made in April, everything in the stream was already announced except raid-lite content. So i can understand people watching the stream and going "yep, we knew all that already, what was this super hyped announcement for?"
---
Don't get me wrong, I'd love the cadence to be much shorter, and the difficulty to be... well just there. But at the point where I am concerning the state of raid... well concerning the state of the game as a whole even, I'd take slow content that makes people I like play again every once in a while than no content at all.
---
Hey! Stop bashing the guy!!!
---
I bet he has a lot of fun in open world, and he feels bad about all the negativity thats on Reddit lately (i'm super guilty of that).
---
I also enjoy open world actually (before you murder me, i'm a CM fractal runner and a scrub raider).
---
You know what would be super cool? Instanced TD meta with 5 man per lane (or 10 man per lane with buffed gerents!!!). Same for AB!!!
---
no we are talking about a Saga. Where you get one story line, then there is another story line in the same story with different characters in a different place, sometimes in a different time. In the end though there is something that ties it together. Same story in the end. Just different components that add up to something.
---
Fire GS in the wall
---
Why? ............................
---
That is by far the dumbest suggestion I've read for a game, that's somehow even worse than Blue Mage's implementation.
---
WvW blueprints were designed with risk in mind, and are the model that should be followed. They simply stay in your inventory until used as intended.
---
I'm still updating and adding things but in general the herbs give a bonus on top of the stats you get:
---
* Cultivated Sesame Seed: Gain Health Every Second
---
* Cultivated Cilantro Leaf: 66% Chance to Steal Life on Critical Hit
---
* Cultivated Mint Leaf: +10% Outgoing Healing
---
* Cultivated Clove: -20% Incoming Condition Duration
---
* Cultivated Peppercorn: -10% Incoming Damage
---
Out of these, for PvE only Cilantro, Peppercorn, and Mint and relevant. Cilantro gives tiny DPS (like 150), peppercorn is just reduced damage which is always good if you're taking hits, and mint is meta for all healers.
---
I have an [in progress Food table here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Meta_Food) I'm still adding in some options and formatting it but it covers pretty much all meta food now.
---
Personally, I did not expect anything else other than LWS5. After anet posting announcement for upcoming announcement in a month I've started expecting something more than just LWS5 since they're making a special announcement. However that lead to such a disappointment because that announcement should've been just a blog post like all previous LWS epidoes. There was no need to rent a stage and make a month early announcement for it.
---
Have you submitted a bug report to anet and maybe even a ticket to support? I dont remember if there was a date that the free Hot for Pof owners would go into effect or if it was immediate, so maybe check on that aswell.
---
I prefer to play Star Citizen to sit on the toilet of my spaceship.
---
Those massives spikes could very easily include raids and other repeatable content that is enough to sustain the game. If the raid community can somewhat sustain with a raid every 9 months I do not see a problem with it sustaining for 12 months with four raids.
---
And yes, I would prefer waiting longer for something of quality, in Swedish we say "The one that is waiting for something good never waits for too long". Furthermore most living world maps are dead long before the next patch drops while HoT metas are still played consistently.
---
Unless they‚Äôre being sent directly to developers I haven‚Äôt seen specific death threats. I‚Äôve seen a few ‚Äúwow Anet devs suck and are lazy‚Äù type comments, but no death threats and nearly all the negative criticism I see is directed at the company and not developers specifically
---
Yeah, you make a great point. This is what I mean. Maybe they plan to do more of this.
---
I'd be stoked even if EotN turned out like Sun's Refuge. Just a cool place for us to refurbish and bring to life again.
---
I do own HoT now, as you can see in the screenshot, the problem is the gemstore still says i can't buy certain items because... they require owning HoT. In all honesty, i just want the damn shirt, but it doesn't appear on the store, and i'm assuming it's the same issue.
---
Power creep is present in core specs, too.
---
Exactly what I was hoping for, since they're using zones for multiple episodes they could even have npc's coming in over time as we improve it
---
It is online , an RPG
---
So kind of you.
---
Everything seems easy when you're an unemployed gamer.
---
I do. I do T4 on daily basis and even if my guild clean raids I skip them
---
&gt; This applied to the ascended plants for at least the first two days after the update that added them,
---
Still worked like that around 12 hours ago.
---
OP's problem seems to involved having the gemstore garden plots as well.
---
Dragon Stand. The end battle with the the boss is too epic.
---
Then I like Tangled Depths Meta...
---
For me all HoT metas over PoF ones.
---
Great map. Are there more shrines besides Wolf and Raven that you could have put on the map?
---
We need more of this kind of meme, not that other humorless entitled shit. Godspeed Charr party guy.
---
WoW and ESO are wonderful single player games. Even BDO can keep you occupied for years with just the single player content (grinding mobs, gearing up, exploring, building a worker empire, fishing, farming, life skilling etc).
---
Can we please stop pretending like MMOs shouldn't incorporate a significant amount of single player content? GW2 does a pretty good job of getting you to interact with other players for everything other than story content while also allowing you to make your own goals to work on without needing other people. It also does a better job than any other MMO of seamlessly getting players to work together on content they wouldn't be able to complete on their own (like Tequatl).
---
I mean, that's the dice though, isn't it? If it does happen on reddit, the moderators take care of it, and if it happens in mail, you are unlikely to see it, which is far more likely to happen than you think. Developers get crazy hate mail all the time.
---
no it's satire
---
/s
---
No, but the effects of that trait has been applied to all staff skills by default now, so all staff AOE skills are larger than they were in the past
---
Very well said. I also wish they had talked a bit how they're doing after the layoffs. But maybe that's not possible.
---
Uh ... does it? I already finished Vision a while ago but I don't remember having to do any mount races for it.
---
thats just speculation on some very vague statements though.
---
I would go and say Asura are the equivalent of Smart Goblins
---
Do not go invoking the name of NCSoft and think that they will swoop in and things will magically get better.

You basically have to make up your own lore because the Commander is such a blank slate. My choices for my human holosmith are either Kasmeer or Ellen Kiel.

&gt; As usual, your mouth is shaped just like ANet's corporate cock. I am really starting to think you're a paid shill.
---
How not toxic of you. No toxicity to see here folks, just reasonable respectful community members politely voicing their concerns.
---
You should make an Indian soap opera version with all the weird flashes and stuff xd
---
&gt; PoF did build up for them, like it or not.
---
Im not saying they didn't, you said they had an expansion each but PoF was PATH OF FIRE, Kralk didn't become a thing until half way, it was focused on Balthazar and introducing Joko to be the focus of the next living world. 
---
Unlike Mordramoth who had the full focus of a living world and expansion and Zhitan who had base game. Kralk was in the back seat for most of S3 and PoF
---
I think what they meant was that playing with others in an organized manner (in a party, group, squad or whatever) like you would in a classical multiplayer PvE game is not required for the vast majority of the game.   
---
It is only required for content specifically made for co-op play (Dungeons, Fractals, Raids) which is a minority of the content.
---
We could play most of GW2 (particularly its open world) completely asocially and ignore or even avoid everyone around us if we wanted to, the game gives us the freedom to do that (you don't even lose out on much at all rewards wise).  
---
But that rarely ever happens, instead we naturally play together. It's more fun and/or faster.
---
For example, I have a daily task to mine some ore in a specific region. That's a single player mission, so I don't organize a group or anything and I just go ahead and do it, for myself.  
---
The most efficient way to do this daily is to harvest a rich vein in that region, so I go to a place where I know I'll find one. To get to that place I first have to go through a cave full of monsters and kill a boss who guards that vein. Pretty easy, I can do that alone.   
---
But since most other players have the same daily, naturally others will have thought of that aswell and when I arrive at the cave a few players have already gone in.  
---
So what do I do? Well help them of course, why not? Together we fight our way through the cave, beat the boss and all get to harvest the node (can't steal it from each other).
---
I didn't sign up for a system to put me into a party with strangers to go fight monster in a cave and a boss. I didn't look for players to form a party with to do my daily.  
---
It just... happened and I think that's beautiful.
---
Now obviously this still particular example wasn't very *massive* multiplayer but the same concept is applied almost *everywhere* in GW2's open world.  
---
You don't enter a matchmaking system to be put together with people who want to have a huge epic battle against a gigantic elder dragon minion, you just happened to pass by or specifically went to where it spawns at the right time.   
---
You don't join a squad to take back a Tarir from the Mordrem, you just happened to be doing events in the Auric basin because you got distracted while doing your daily and are now coordinating with dozens of players via map chat to take the 4 vines down at the same time.  
---
(This particular one happens very often to me and I have a blast every time)
---
I've said it several times, and I'll say it again:
---
Nobody at ANet fucking tests shit they push out. This is standard Bethesda emulation, only they can't count on fans fixing their shit.
---
&gt; Expect WoW, FFXIV and other MMOs combat systems is still inferior to what GW2 has and many see it just as a massive wasted potential that anet use the best combat system in the industry for mindless 1111 boss farms/fights.
---
The problem is as great as GW2s combat system is, it's not nearly as easy to make "hard" content for. Every class in the game having a few-seconds cooldown invulnerability would damn near destroy every bit of raid content in every other MMO. That's even before other class mechanics. Chronomancer would be a an absolute god tier tank in every MMO even without boon shit simply because of the amount of invuln it can generate, but many other classes would also break the shit out of things. There's also a ton of freedom of movement so it's harder to have "soft" punishments such as FFXIV Black Mage getting forced to move is a DPS loss, and melee being forced out of melee because they can't iframe through mechanics.
---
Yeah, this comment section is filled with people calling op a dumbass because he "doesn't realize these "trolls" stopped playing because anet bad"
---
Mate, if you reply to someone with any of the lines op listed at the start you are toxic. If someone defends the announcement and you reply to them "fucking white knight" without disputing their points you are toxic. If someone complains about the announcement and you reply to them with "go play something else" you are toxic.
---
If you are offended by this post, chance is, you are using those same replies and are more toxic than you are helpful.
---
Did you just call the copper fed a pay to win mechanic?
---
Because these wretches cancerous people, shareholders, get really fucking antsy when a company's net worth isn't growing exponentially. If you had a 10 million worth growth in 2017, then in 2018 another 10 million growth isn't enough anymore.
---
Yes. Note the part where I wrote "you are not 'supporting the developers'".
---
 [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterargument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterargument)
---
*sigh*
---
Tencent doesn't own GGG.
---
any money you spend in game goes directly to ncsoft, who in turn pays the wages for anet. 
---
so youre basically bribing ncsoft to not cancel the game and fire anets employees.
---
That's a very low bar for toxic. That outfit and the merch schilling was very awkward and cringe. It felt like something off of The Nerd Crew.
---
And people wear special outfits to get noticed. He got his outfit noticed.
---
So you can show me some, right?
---
As a current mod, the last week has made me want to quit the game not because of ANet but because of the 200-300+ reported posts and comments of pure disgusting hatred and evil I saw  the last few days. It makes me not want to be a part of this anymore even though I still love the game and want it to succeed. 
---
That being said, it was not hard to find people who like me love the game and just want ANet to do better and are treating others and the developers with respect when voicing their anger to the current situation and to those people I am thankful.
---
I don't remember needing gold on any of the races for Vision.... recheck said achiv.... now a few might to go towards x episode meta achiv which you could/should need so &gt;_&gt;".
---
Obsidi- Os.  Stay crunchy in milk.
---
Verdant Brink. I will play VB anytime someone is actually organizing it. I love how mobile that meta is, i love fighting off waves, and I love how it has giant bosses with their own mechanics. It is hands down the most fun HoT meta for me.
---
In PoF I actually really like the Forged with Fire meta. It's quick but the fight against the dogs is actually pretty fun. Much better than Serpent's Ire
---
Charr need no gods
---
Sorry I meant 'in a bad place'
---
I really don't get it. 
---
They didnt promissed an xpac. They didnt promissed new specs.
---
They did promised the next LS chapter. They delivered it.
---
They also talked build templates. They announced that HoT will be free to those that bought PoF and to those that previously paid for it, they will give an ingame gratification. They announced strike missions.
---
I've got far more than I was waiting for.
---
But for some reason unknown to me, people wanted more from a Living Story chapter..
---
&gt;He's on the edge about trying this game out because he's also invested in the other games.
---
Your friend can only lose time by trying out the game, let them know the base game is free and a decent place to start even if its not a great representation of the end game stuff. Welcome them if they are interested and them them out as much as they want. If they are not so interested do your best to not become one of those pushy friends that doesnt get that, not everyone has to like what you like.
---
As I explained at the asterisk (\*), things, like salvage kits, are arbitrarly annoying to use and take up a lot of inventory space. The only reason it is annoying is to push people towards buying the copper fed salvage o matic. You get an advantage, such as a QoL improvement, by taking out the credit card. P2W
---
&gt; It's just one, not a plural there.
---
One in the preview, they talked about them in plural. Also they said the encounter evolve with future updates, talking about missionS is correct at this point.
---
&gt; Deathbranded Shatt is a "world boss" so I guess that episode was expansion like too.
---
A new world boss, two armor sets and a new upgradable instance. Yes, I would call that expansion like. Also they talked about expansion like content in LS episode *before* Jahai bluffs was released. 
---
&gt; Improving how?, I don't recall anything about them improving masteries, just adding new ones as with every LS episode before.
---
If you compare expansion masteries with LS masteries you find differences. Expansion masteries have one theme and improves it further and further. You learn gliding, then stealth gliding, using updrafts etc.
---
LS masteries on the other hand are stand alones (more or less). In LS3 each episode had it's own mastery and barely any of them are useful out of their episodes map. It's got way better with LS4, but still not on the same level as expansions.
---
Raids are not over. I've been told directly by a dev that wing 8 is being developed, but they couldn't give me any details or a release date obviously.
---
100% worth using it as well as  the gathering booster put on a character you dont play but only gather the HI garden nodes with so it barely ever ticks down.
---
play wvw, cap stuffz, kill plebs, and before u notice u have thousands of all
---
&gt;**The "spiraling shithole of negativity" is a reasonable response.**
---
I'm voting for this sentence as the new subreddit banner
---
They never should have implemented elite specs in the first place, true. However in order for that system to work *at all* we need a broad selection of elite specs to cover all roles we lost when the previous trait lines were rendered obsolete. Since the existing elite specs aren't going away I'd rather have 3-4 more so we can actually go back to having decent build diversity within each profession.
---
&gt; they do not fit in well with Gw2, at least not for the consumer.
---
We have gotten 7 years out of this game, which is nothing to sneeze at.  GW2 had to differentiate itself in the market from WoW and others in order to ~survive~ thrive, and the free to play model did that.  The Gemstore is an important part of the free to play model, but obviously comes with some down side.   I am not sure if we would have come this far if this game was subscription based.
---
Jormag is gonna attack us and asks us to join him or stand alone and all we do is fight each other and ArenaNet.
---
Then Jormag being like "Alright Everyone, Chill!"
---
More fitting with the theme imo.
---
I was almost jebaited into thinking it wouldn't have the arah p2 music
---
Battle in Tarir or Tangled Depths Meta. Their just easy enough and just difficult enough to be able to stand doing them over and over.   
---
And the music. It's probably mostly the music.
---
Because the ArenaNet forums are a hugbox where not sucking the company's cock gets you banned.
---
Thanks senpai
---
Unless YOU can get proof that a specific person is solely responsible for said 'bad move', there is absolutely NO way to know who should shoulder the blame. Every company (large and small) have TONS of politics that are in play, all the time.
---
Because they promoted/hyped it as though it was more than just another Living Story chapter.
---
Plus, it's time for new specs, gameplay, etc in the game's lifecycle.
---
To clarify; as of this date you cannot acquire a single mount skin or glider skin (both core features of their respective expansions) from anything other than the gemstore or black lion chests.
---
And the solution? Do not buy any microtransctions in any other games neither. There is a lot of money, in many different game genres, to be made without microtransactions, companies just have no incentive to make their money in another ways unless we stop buying microtransactions. If we remove the "demand" for microtransactions, we remove the supply
---
Add Attack on Titans opening 1 as back music, it ll be epic.
---
Glad to hear that. Still hope for both Blood and Ash to get their own cultural identity!
---
&gt; Timing of the announcement was awful, tbh.
---
Or was it? I'm starting to wonder if they were banking on the long weekend to weather the storm. Let people go apeshit while nobody's in the office, then release a curt statement saying they heard our concerns, and then go back to business as usual.
---
It's not that they wanted more (ok, well they did, but I don't think anyone really honestly thought they were getting more), they were upset with how the announcement was structured.
---
Anet rented out a theater and hyped up something that could have been summed up in a blog post.  The way they handled the announcement was reminiscent of an Xpac or Gw3 announcement.  I'm almost positive when they announced both HoT and PoF Xpacs, they did the same type of hype.
---
So of course players when they see this type of hype, they expected something else on top of the LS announcement.  If this was in a blog post, this backlash never would have happened.
---
Fans: (criticizes the lake of information in a hyped up presentation and still left wondering about the future of the game)  
---
Arenanet: ... whoa, that's toxic. Everyone chill. We have Jormag!
---
Is [Elder Shaman Aukje](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elder_Shaman_Aukje) wearing any gear that you can aquire? I'd like to make a Norn that looks kind of like her.
---
So hear me out here. I just power levelled a character from 1 to 80 over three days. Here's some tips I use to make levels go fast 
---
First, don't focus hearts. You'll drive yourself made trying to do all the hearts you come across. Some are fast but overall most get done passively by doing events.
---
If you pass an event, just do it. A lot of events are chains and it actually is a solid way to get exp and heart completion. Most events satisfy the conditions of a nearby heart. 
---
Just uncovering the map and passing by waypoints and POIs gives a surprisingly large amount of exp. Just walk through any new map and uncover it and you'll find yourself gaining a lot of levels. 
---
Prioritize weapons that deal high amounts of power damage. While levelling conditions like burning or poison can be really lackluster but the weapons are balanced around those conditions. Axes and greatswords for warrior for example are a good go-to. 
---
Level your cooking if you can. It only costs about 6g or so to take cookimg from 1-80. It's about 7 levels worth but the guide on GW2crafts.com has you making food that gives you 10% bonus exp from kills. That'll save you a fair bit of time. 
---
Don't rush it like me :p I had mounts to make it easier but if you don't have those you'll just grind yourself down. Learning the world is actually pretty useful and there's a lot of fun stuff to be discovered.
---
good tip thanks
---
Just a note they showed off some new gameplay for the next big update where players on the large plains map can complete objectives to help other players in space. Not the same thing but I think it's a good way to connect groups to one another.
---
i now realise it was a dumb question XD
---
I wouldn't make raids and mounts a selling point
---
What exactly am I winning?
---
Such a great idea. I would love a place like Sun's Refuge that we could build up over the course of the whole season/saga, rather than just for a single episode.
---
living Lies more like it lol
---
Haha. Funny.
---
One of the images showed during the stream was a brick building with a charr-styled metal roof. Was a 3d model iirc. So I'd bet they do.
---
They certainly *should* at least.
---
You clearly don't know who Jay Wilson is or what he did, but I agree with you on a principle.
---
I thoroughly enjoy doing AB, seeing everyone work together at each post is awesome. Also the loot isn‚Äôt terrible :D.
---
And we all know how we solve _that_ problem.
---
When the developer is actually a gamer with passion.
---
Devs have fixed contracts I am sure, otherwise we'd see half of them being milionaires by now. Profit be bigger or smaller gets kicked up while ordinary 8h shift dev doesnt see big changes in his/her pay. If indeed the cosmetics they make would be visible in their paycheck they would be motivated to deliver even more, not working on any other non gw2 related projects as it would mean less points in their monthly pay.
---
NCsoft on the other hand did see what was going on, 250 people emloyed by Anet, lack of content, disatisfied customers and a bunch of "cant profit off of" projects. Since NCsoft only cares about monthly points they wanted to change Anet's no content, much cosmetics, plethora of other projects ideology to focus on the game more. Lets be honest here, Anet shifting towards no expac didnt come from the layoffs, they didnt plan on doing it at all but rather invest in other stuff.
---
I suspect they'll work hard in the upcoming months just to please the big players upstairs.
---
Primordus underwent a BIG unexplained change as well, and the norn and asura look fairly different too.
---
Did you forget that they've mentioned several times that Kasmeer and Marjory will come back into focus?
---
As long as they drop raid loot I'm fine :D
---
The map (player map, M key) design wasn't fitting for the multilayered maps of HoT but the maps themselves aren't really that bad. Even TD is pretty simple once you work through it enough which I think is a much better way of handling exploration than the massive and empty maps of PoF. The timers were always annoying though.
---
nah that owl just had some unfinished business before it died, that's why it's still around as a spirit. didn't get to finish that nice juicy mouse before it choked on a bone
---
I really hope the new dynamic map evolution actually helps aleviate this. I agree that past seasons have had this problem (though I think Season 4 did much better at it than people admit) but their whole idea is to avoid that in the Saga.
---
Aesthetic changes are common (not sure I'd really agree with norn and asura being very different though). But a switch around is far less common.
---
Usually when aesthetics change, its to something new (in gw) and not looking like something else which in turn looks like another thing in gw.
---
Just some ideas...
---
* You can come and go as you want, you'll never be left behind.
---
* WvW is a thing, it's unique.
---
* Mixed combat system: not only tap target, but some skills are also a combo
---
* action-based, movement heavy
---
* Horizontal Progression (can be a plus or minus)
---
* You can play together on any level (pretty good downscaling)
---
* The Holy Trinity isn't enforced, or at least roles aren't forced too much to specific classes
---
* Old maps are relatively full compared to other MMO's
---
* Base game free to play and features the whole core game
---
* Not pay 2 win (unfortunately pay to look good lol jk, you can farm... for a while...)
---
* Crafting is actually worth it
---
* Endless content for achievement hunters
---
* Casual game with challenging end-game (100cm, 99cm, dhuum cm, etc. don't deny it, I come from Wildstar and it can be challenging on certain days)
---
* PvP is fair (no PvP gear that gives an unfair advantage, for example)
---
Sure, but in those cases the answer is given to you, it's not figured out. Of course it can be fun to speculate, but it would come with so many assumptions about how evolution even works in tyria and the kind of creatures: The ancestor of an asura has no reason to bear any resemblence to anything we recognise, and the best information we have suggests that norn are descended from bear-like creatures rather than primates as their current form would suggest to us.
---
you mean bunker minstrel chrono meta?
---
Copper fed is the only thing that comes close to pay to win because it makes inventory management A LOT easier. With the sheer amount of worthless junk the game drops I would have to buy 30*25usages every time I log in.
---
Final fantasy has a ton of difficult segregational content and the community is doing fine.  Its just a misnomer to blame toxicity on game difficulty.   
---
Toxicity will arise regardless of stopgaps you put in.  Look at gw2 pvp and wvw. Same shit.   
---
Even in meta events with the focus on performing tighter tasks, the frustration rises too.  GW2 isn't a bastion of friendly casuals, its just a grey gruel of blandness that rarely has anything worth getting invested enough in to fight over.
---
I still don't understand why people turn their noses up at something that was perfectly set up. It was predictable, sure, but so what? It was consistant storytelling. That's supposed to be a good thing. The biggest flaw with it was th emonths of waiting for her to undie.
---
That Yellow Journalism clickbait shit title though.
---
Really knocked that joke out of the park. Good job, you can take the rest of the day off.
---
Additional query: What does ‚ÄúRIP in piece‚Äù mean?
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
If every job still has a niche that hasn't been filled by elite specs then sure. You might be right, considering there's power/condi for attack builds and healer/supportdps for support roles for a grand total of 4 niches a job can fill.
---
I still don't think it's a good idea though. Look at the state of fractals for example, where there's a meta to run healbrand and alac rene at the moment. I think even if you get, say, thief to fill a support role with a new elite spec, the meta will still remain alac rene. Or change to alac thief.
---
What I'm saying is new elite specs are not going to really do much. The meta may change, but it'll still be stale in the end. Which would bring my back to my point with new elite specs either unbalancing old ones or being underwhelming new ones.
---
Ultimately I just don't think it's worth it for the devs to continue making new ones.
---
You make great points. There are 18 elite specs in the game already and each balance patch is filled with irate people claiming how ANET fucked up with X, Y, and Z.  Imagine how much more people go ape &amp;!%$ crazy on patch day if we had 9 more E Specs.  And how many more DPS builds do we need with their own unique take on "Spin to Win"?
---
Nan desu ka? :3
---
xDD
---
&gt; why anyone even thinks that The Key of Ahdashim is the last raid we will ever get?
---
Because they haven't mentioned raids since. They haven't said, "Never fear, more raids will come!" They haven't even said, "We have some ideas for more raids but we're keeping it under wraps for now." They have given no encouragement on this topic. Without any talking point on raids coming from Anet, players are thinking they just don't want to admit they have NO plan to do more raids.
---
Woah woah. excuse my noobness M'lord. but fashion wars? is there like some character poll/competition on armor combos like FF14? :D
---
Sorry but that just doesn't work. Macrotransactions will always win out on the purely financial level **because** they are abusive and manipulative. The only way I see to actually "fight back" is to leave all those games by the wayside despite their popularity and instead operate some kind of discussion and recommendation platform where games are *only* evaluated for their quality as actual games. Indie developers can scrape by with *far* lower profit margins and there's a plethora of completely free or even open source games out there, we just need to focus attention and support on the good ones.
---
On that note for a turn-based pixel/ASCII graphics "RPG" Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead is absolutely amazing and modded Minecraft still is the greatest free time black hole ever invented IMO. Unfortunately 3D graphics and dedicated multiplayer servers tend to be both expensive and technologically challenging so there won't be nearly as many options in that direction.
---
Dragon Fall because it's 3 organized lanes, and Dragon Stand because it's 3 areas in which players are free to do what they like between boss encounters.
---
That's actually true. Chill guys, they still have Jormag, technically Primordus, also Bubbles/steve/selbbub/underwater expansion that everyone is hyped for secretly. Also Cantha.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
GW2 punishes you for engaging with the game with the aggressive "No farm left untouched" diminishing returns.  
---
No reward worth getting due to the fear that people might farm it and get something.  
---
Wow, you worked really hard and completed the octovine meta, enjoy your barrel of literal garbage.   Ohh, we added a neat thing in the game, its now .001% chance to drop, but also you can't farm it for reasons.  
---
Ohh we added a thing you can farm in the game, better dedicate the next three months of gold farming because we didn't plan loot vectors right. Nullification sigil junk as an example.   
---
They either have no hoops that actively break your knees for trying to jump. Or too many hoops that will invariably feed back into gem to gold conversion because they have some obtuse forgotten content reward they want you to have 300 of.
---
Is that still a selling point for people? I was under the impression that ANet had largely abandoned guild specific stuff
---
Err, yes they do.
---
Just like how people with no self-awareness will unironically paraphrase that quote. Even post nerfs HoT is still miles ahead of PoF in terms of difficulty. Mounts have basically made open world mobs irrelevant and even then the actual mobs in PoF are incredibly easy. Every enemy in HoT has a specific mechanic, whether it be requiring CC (roller devils), AOE (raptors), or blocking (bristleback). The most advanced thing in PoF are enemies with optional breakbars and the ones that you have to dodge when they burrow underground. None of these mechanics are punishing in the first place. 
---
TLDR; HoT made you learn how to use abilities so even if it got nerfed it is still much more difficult for a brainless player than the current game.
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-is-free-with-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire/
---
PoF gives HoT now.
---
No, because they get removed by twitter because they violate their policies, but I can definitely show you where some of them were.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/AAefYZG.png](https://i.imgur.com/AAefYZG.png)
---
Read and reported several myself.  Might try pulling your head from your ass, cause apparently you seem to think that there aren't some people being incredibly awful out there.
---
They just changed how you wait. GW2 wait times are obfuscated, but typicaly 200-1000% greater than anything FFXIV could dream of throwing at you.   
---
Need to do dragon stand meta? better wait 20+ hours till your schedule aligns with the groups running it.
---
Sadly not, no. Norn NPCs have some really cool cultural clothes we can't get :(
---
Since the endgame in GW2 is very open ended and there is no gear progression (ascended is the highest and that has been around since forever) there is this old joke that the true endgame is fashion.
---
Every now and then there are community driven fashion wars and sometimes guilds will have them internally.
---
I don't know. Many people were quite adamant about the one thing they wanted to hear and it was always a very precise info (not the same for each of them but still).
---
Then the show disappointed said people because everything said was already known (on these issues).
---
People who would have been placated by a hollow statement like 'and remember, we care' did not partake in the hurricane.
---
Unless you play fashion wars. Then there are a lot of exclusive skins and mini's to raids.
---
In the quoted comment's (above) context I bet you've seen a good amount of actually constructive cricism in piles of reported posts *in the years before* and that's what is crappy about this subreddit.
---
Regarding numbers, the last few days are not the definition of this subreddit, because everyone - even those who tried constructive criticism before - are basically fed up with anet at this point and you shouldn't be surprised if you do get less positive criticism in the pile of reports for the anouncement like you are used to because there is nothing to be suggested on, it's just a wave of dissapointed people (me included) that probably felt like a marketing toy that is experimented on after the announcement.
---
I have been part of this ride longer than some gw2 devs but I am not the person to say stuff that supports that I and many of my guild wars friends do not agree with. If a newcomers asks me if he should join gw2 I give a *vague* no and explain when he or she should or should not join. I don't say "yes this is the MMO. Definitely give it a try" anymore and list its strengths alphabetically which makes me sad.
---
I have a friend who plays Lord of the Rings online and she said they got a new dungeon, a new raid, and a new map the past few months and they‚Äôre getting a new playable race and a new expansion probably before Christmas.
---
It blew my mind, because I thought the same as you...  But apparently they crank out content at a pace anet can only dream of.    (I mean, obviously the quality in GW2 is probably higher and certainly more detailed/time consuming to make, but still: it‚Äôs  crazy to see how involved a game we all assume is dead can be compared to ours, which is supposed to be near the top of its field.)
---
After reading the 20 page essay the director at bungee wrote for destiny 2 it makes a lot of other game company communication look like a joke. Bungee really did an amazing thing with their recent Director Cut parts 1-3 communications.
---
The official announcement page makes it more clear:
---
"Episode 1, is set in the Far Shiverpeaks, in a map that will expand to encompass new stories, activities, and places over the first and second episodes."
---
People can reply to what you had said without it being about you.  A discussion is not supposed to be about yourself when referring to a community, but I could say that your responses here show that you're likely part of the problem. (This response is now directly about you, so take that as you will.)
---
Just ranting. Just finished PoF main story last battle and nothing happened for a while so I was like, wat if I jump off? Nope, got kicked from the instance. And now I need to go back to the area to do the whole thing again. It‚Äôs also a pain just to get back cause there‚Äôs an event there. I wish this game have checkpoints for these kind of instances. FML
---
You too! Wow great yes! You do you! Astounding!

Everything you do is a gigantic collection of many other collections...

 Especially getting infusions such as chak egg sac or mystic infusion. The collection titled "grind 10,000gold"
---
As a raider, I can tell you that other than trying for Lowman‚Äôs (speedrun records too, but it‚Äôs mostly all about the lowman kills these days), there‚Äôs no real challenge or progressions left in the scene.   If you‚Äôre even somewhat decent, you‚Äôll be able to 100% the cm‚Äôs within the first week (maybe two weeks tops, if all you do is pug) of their release.
---
I would say most people *are* doing it for the rewards (big chunk of gold for minimal time every week) and of course the fun/social aspect.  (My weekly reset clear is the only time I‚Äôm even in game lately for more than 15 mins at a time, and that‚Äôs just cuz my group‚Äôs good times to play/chill with.)
---
Oh yeah, I always forget about that. Kinda dumb thing if you ask me :I.
---
Got apple in your eyes?
---
&gt;  or do you mean just boss events and such, because once youve killed one King/ lord of a territory, youve killed them all.
---
oof
---
it sounds like you're ignoring/bypassing most of the open world content if that's what you boil the experience down to.
---
good criticism wasn't reported more than any other category of posts. even comments didn't get that many reports. mostly the report hate has been towards sound of reason amongst disappointment, *looks at a certain lord*. 
---
Of course things could have changed in the past 9 months but that's how I remember it
---
I gave up on the game a long time ago
---
I am just generally concerned about the game. Things are not looking bright since post PoF era. Nothing to look to, nothing to be excited about. The information that they were working on other games/products instead of putting all resources into GW2 was not very nice for players that spend a lot of money and time on the game. Some of the latest additions to the game felt like anet is compleatly disconnected from the community. The 30th announcement was announced and hyped in a way, like there will be a big breaking point for the game. It was smartly scheduled few days after WoW classic launch, so that players can try wow classic and remember why they like GW2 more and then the big news hits. But the event only confirmed, that things are not getting any brighter soon and that all the hope was for nothing. 
---
One thing which I really didnt like was the rebranding from Living World/Story into Saga. It was never really a living world, that vision compleatly failed years ago anyway, but at leats for the current players, we know what LS is. Really it starts to feel like anet is just manipulating us with false promises, saying like they will deliver something (xpac like features) but turns out they were just making hype for nothing, marketing practices like rebranding (same shit in different package), dodging any kind of real question or concern from the community, trying to use "toxicity" as an excuse for not delivering, etc... so that they can continue to milk our money. I want honest relationship between company and the customer, lately it doesnt feel so.
---
Look at PoE which is one of the best performing RPG games of late. I know exactly when something will happen in this game in advance. They publish big list of changes they will implement in advance, so that players can theory craft and discuss things before it is actually playable. It feels good when you get this kind of information, feels like they care about you as a customer. They are very consistent and when they dont deliver, they actually acknowledge it, read the feedback and change according to suggestions which make sense and are popular. In comparison; anet just ignores every feedback (pretends like they dont tho) and then maybe fix the problem years after. I am comparing this two games, because they use a similar business model but use compleatly different approuch when it comes to communication with the community. PoE is managing a healty relationship with its customers. PoE is going up, GW2 is going down (just joking, we actually dont know where GW2 is going, because Anet doesnt want to communicate. lol).
---
grats on finally understanding how they advertised the game would be for up to 5 years before its release
---
I had a brief period where i tried tanking at ~1400 toughness in pugs. Even though I'd always ask for everyone's toughness, there was always someone who would remain silent but have more toughness than me. Now I'm full minstrel every time I'm tanking in a pug.
---
A nice fringe benefit is that it makes my traited Wells and traited mantra heal very strong for helping pugs survive. On Saturday i was doing Largos and our healer died early on left side. I was able to provide enough healing to keep the 4 of us alive and we killed Largos.
---
that view could work, if the best looks weren't behind gems for which you just need to do a months worth of fractals
---
&gt;Expect WoW, FFXIV and other MMOs combat systems is still inferior to what GW2 has
---
That's quite wild statements, while it is true that the combat is more "fun" than WoW/FFXIV, these games still have interesting gameplay (the old cooldown based, many-abilities system). And they have a way better implementation of healing/tanking (GW2 wasn't designed for these roles in the first place).
---
&gt;  anet use the best combat system in the industry
---
 It may have been true at the release, 7 years ago (though I still doubt that) but I'd argue that true Action MMO's (like BDO and B&amp;S in which the gameplay is the only highlight) have much better combat systems.
---
GW2 is still midway between true Action combat and old MMO design.
---
I...ive learned my lesson papa Q.Q.
---
These post have actually taught me the important of sipping the tea instead of trying to chug the beer in one sitting. going to limit myself to an hr or 2 a day. relax and play the game without worrying about catching up.
---
There is a HUGE difference in quality between PoF maps and LWS4 maps. Also, do you know what expansions have that season don't so far? Elite specs.
---
Can't judge for others but for me they are useless. They don't even have a nomal bank.
---
Wasn't Primodus still in the Ring of Fire from the last time we saw him?
---
It's not p2w. P2w is, for example, when you get stronger in PvP than other people, just by paying.
---
There's a lot more to legendaries than just skins- things like free stat-swapping- but between first and second gen legendaries, yeah, the only difference in the item itself is the skin- it's not like one can do more than another. The costs are different, too, since the method for making first vs second gen legendaries is different. I think second gens are generally more expensive? The wiki has more info.
---
And yes, you can make a second gen before making a first gen. So if, for example, you like Nevermore better than the Bifrost, you can just make Nevermore and never make the Bifrost. The only benefit to making both would be having two legendary staves and having both skins unlocked.
---
I was interested in guild wars 2 from the very first reveal, where they described the wvw mode that sounded fucking amazing to me. I went on to play over 3000 hours in wvw, made plenty of friends some of which I now consider far more than just gaming friends. I absolutely treasure so many of the people and memories from gw2, but where my favorite mode was once part of the core vision for the game, it's now years between any kind of significant change.
---
There are no alternatives on the market for me. I've also played mmos for over 15 years consistently, so I find you trying to redefine what a mmo is pretty funny, especially since the things you decry as not mmo are staple features of the biggest mmos on the market.
---
&gt; Sun's Refuge: really? you think this is anywhere near the conversation for expansion level content?
---
I talked about the whole episode, Sun's Refuge was only *one* point. But sure, ignoring the rest, because it doesn't fit your argument, huh?
---
&gt; Expansion Level Features: new especs, new raids, new fractals
---
I agree with especs, but the point in this conversation are *other* expansion level features than especs. Pretty dumb to argue with especs at this point. 
---
Raids, sure. We got the last wing 3 months ago and normaly get a new one every ~7 months. Complaining about not getting a new raid wing now is nonesense at this time. 
---
Fractals *never* were expansion content. They always came indepentent to any expansion stuff. IF you want to link them to anything, it's the LS, because new fractals often came with the same updates as new LS episodes. They never came with an expansion.
---
I did the worst organised Dragon's Stand today. I think one of the commanders didn't speak English, which is fine, but he was also following me *with my commander tag on* while no one took the middle lane. A language barrier is fine, but don't literally follow another commander if you've tagged up. 
---
In the end, someone mentored up on mid and I joined them. South had about fifty million people and were the slowest to complete all the phases, I assume because all the enemies were scaled up massively. They managed to pull their legendary boss out of the centre at one point and couldn't take it down. 
---
The battle on the floating islands was complete mayhem, but it's quite hard to fail that one with so many people. 
---
It was awful and the most fun I've had on that map in a while.
---
This is an ancient post. Gaile doesnt even work there anymore.
---
&gt; The commentariat was mixed about Bayer‚Äôs rather sensible comments
---
Here's the issue I have with Rubi's comments. "Don't attack developers personally" is a completely valid statement that I agree with wholeheartedly. However, she lumped in snarky comments or metaphors like "turning off the heat after you paid the bill" with creepy Hitler references and declared them all unacceptable. 
---
I like snark. I like sarcasm. I like colorful metaphors. I like when people who are passionate about things get demonstrative and hyperbolic (either positively or negatively) because that's how passion is expressed. Even if you don't like those things, they are not abuse of developers worthy of being called out for. 
---
Toxic criticism is bad, but not all colorful criticism is toxic.
---
I mean, it's not like it happened recently, but EA did release good games with original IPs once.  Their slip in to corporate cash grab territory just happened to spearhead the movement for most of the rest of the companies that have since followed their model.
---
I expect another forum post from Mike Z giving us a pat on the shoulders and the community suddenly goes "best game ever".
---
Searched the quest on Wiki, doesn't say anything about recovering the letter if you delete it
---
I know, but I'd never seen this.
---
Haha, I haven‚Äôt done Tequatl since release. I do however remember waiting with so many other players, for Tequatl to spawn...*reminisces*
---
I *love* tagging up for Dragonfall and leading a squad into glory, helping out the commanders in the other two lanes as needed. When it's coordinated, it's *glorious* and you're right that there's so much to do. Putting "take out the pylons" in the squad chat and watching the number drop rapidly is a good feeling.
---
This article is doing its best to kiss ANet's ass without generating backlash. They paint the consumer in the worst light possible, and would eagerly call them all racist incel nazis if it wasn't for the fact that ANet is absolutely in the wrong here.
---
And maybe what's "great" to those people isn't what's "great" to everyone. I think the casual design of this game is pretty great, personally. It's different than other big-name MMOs. I came here from WoW because I was tired of the bullshit gear grind (and the sub fee) over there, despite enjoying the game a lot in most other respects.
---
You are not going to get any further "definite confirmation" of a casual focus, and it's stupid to expect that. Such an announcement would only do incredible harm to the game, because the people who feel rejected like that would set everything on fire on their way out (they're already setting everything on fire, but it would be even worse). I don't understand why people need an explicit announcement, anyway, when literally everything about the game has screamed "casual" from Day One. 
---
Oh that's right -- because people make up expectations in their own heads, and then scream bloody murder when the expectations they built up for something weren't in line with reality. Just because some people want something doesn't make it true or mean they'll get it, yet they'll cry to the heavens that they were *promised* this thing, anyway, despite there never being any indication whatsoever that this thing would ever happen. This isn't just a GW2 thing, it's a thing that people tend to do with literally everything (especially dating/personal relationships, but that's a whole 'nother post for a whole 'nother subreddit).
---
its reddit, i dont play the game and i realy dont miss it, i can keep interesting in whats going on and still dont have to play
---
I have made many critical posts in my time on this sub, many of them this year, several in the past week. I manage to do it without attacking the appearance of one of ArenaNet's staff members just fine.
---
&gt;  I'm sick of the fucking attitude game devs have adopted now on social media.
---
Not a single dev has done that. Not one person has dismissed all criticsm as a personal attack or a death threat, not a single dev has said the community should just be happy with the announcement. A community manager has made specific, qualified comments about actual harassment that is commonplace in the industry (harassment like being unable to go on stage and do your job without mocking threads made about you online by "fans", or having your comments mischaracterised into a strawman ironically doing the exact thing so many falsely claim Rubi did).
---
If you think "player writes constructive post online" is newsworthy you don't understand how journalism works, I can't say that any other way. If you can't understand or see how so much of gamer-developer interactions are incredibly harmful, abusive and toxic, I don't think anyone can help you, or maybe you are just not paying attention. Not ALL gamer-developer interactions (Rubi isn't saying that, the massively article isn't saying that, I'm not saying that), just like saying sexist men exist is not saying ALL men are sexist... I can't believe this shit still needs to be explained like this still. 
---
For the record, I'm one of the disappointed people. I wanted elite specs, I wanted an expansion, years ago I wanted more dungeons instead of fractals. I've been disappointed too and I've publicly said as much several times, I still somehow managed to read Rubi's comments without thinking she was talking about me.
---
I haven't seen a single developer or reporter say that that all of the disappointment is toxic or abusive, but I've seen plenty of people on this sub stating that to be the case.
---
No-one is pretending like constructive criticism doesn't exist. Plenty of people are pretending like gamers abusing developers doesn't exist... and many of them are doing while simultaneously being abusive to developers.
---
I am I toxic for doubting you on this? :)
---
Ok maybe it's true, but good criticism gets down voted to hell and then people are anchored. There's a phenomenon where when a post already has downvotes future people are much more likely to create their oppinion much faster based on the existing downvotes. This is because (now I pull from afar) as apes we had to rely on society to warn us when enemies are nearby. When another ape rushed to us and said "there is tiger" it *was safer to believe it than to not do so.* You also could loose respect and rang when you gossip to other apes about false information putting anyone in danger and loosing rang &gt;!which was equally to loosing identity and loosing identity meant death of the ego and death of the ego is translated to death by the mind.!&lt; Many people aren't making themselfs aware of it but we *subconsiously* still have this behaviour as a left over from our ancestors. This is heavily influencing this subreddit threads. I often see numerous threads with non-native english get downvoted to oblivious because people aren't trying to create their own oppinion of something hard enough by grasping the content that is not written in WP levels of english. 
---
I am also not native and that  is also part of what I experience on here. No one likes to be in the bad light so when something is already downvoted better downvote it as well to stay relevant in the circle-jerk.
---
 Dungeons, WvW and PvP were all means to be challenging and "hardcore" parts of the game since launch. 
---
Dungeons were meant to be the ultimate PvE challenge indeed, it doesn't mean they were difficult in the way hardcore players could expect (nothing compared to what the other PvE games have to offer).
---
They were perfectly challenging enough so casual players could spend some time trying on them but still succeed.
---
WvW and PvP can totally be played casually, they wasn't even ranked arena at the release. 
---
All of these game modes could be played and "completed" (for Dungeons) by players with "casual" schedules (as in less than 10 hours / week of game time).
---
&gt; Anet wanted the content to be accessible and respectful of your time 
---
Yes, that's basically what catering for casual means, and it's not a bad thing indeed, people with little time and with small/medium investment could complete pretty much anything in the game.
---
It's a pretty relevant concern. Stop sucking corporate cock and maybe the public perception of your mouths will improve.
---
An easy mode definitely would address accessibility. As another comment stated, Fractals has this, and it works wonderfully. T4s are still respectable. 
---
People say there's good raid training groups but why burden other players with the training when you could literally **permanently** implement a form of training that's both rewarding and effective and give the experienced players more time to enjoy the game every other way?
---
Strike Missions sound cool and I'm looking forward to them, but it doesn't achieve what an easy mode or difficulty tiers would do for raids.
---
It's specifically the amount that ANet earned for NCsoft, so it is pretty much pure profit.  Operating costs would have been taken long before that point, and it will also be far from the total profits of the game as NC doesn't take 100% of the profits.
---
I meant that you could possibly find the content of the letter.
---
I apologize if my account being older and me posting for the first time offends you, that isn‚Äôt my intention. I‚Äôm not good at posting things, and I‚Äôve always been the person to read, instead of post of reddit.
---
&gt; Why is it time? Because you think it is?
---
Path of Fire came out two years ago next week. Yes, it's time for a new expansion pack.
---
if there are no worthy comments been made no reason to allow for more
---
Yeah, just finally rebeat it :D. The only issue I have with this is that it follows directly after the previous instance so if you leave the instance for some reason, you get directly teleported to the entrance of the previous instance. Since I didn‚Äôt unlock the close teleport point, the run back to the battle entrance is just annoying with constant lightning strikes at your face. I think it took me 4 tries to get back &lt;.&lt;. 
---
Anyway thanks for the answer, just wanna rant XD
---
I want him to be in my ranger pet

---
&gt;As a current mod, the last week has made me want to quit the game not because of ANet but because of the 200-300+ reported posts and comments of pure disgusting hatred and evil I saw the last few days. It makes me not want to be a part of this anymore even though I still love the game and want it to succeed.
---
Path of Fire was released aprox 2 years ago. Two years before Path of Fire, Heart of Thorns was released. 
---
The main post-release story of PoF recently ended. Previously, LS's changed the world to set up the next expansion, as was done pre-HoT and pre-PoF. A dragon is now dead and Joko is dead, etc. 
---
On top of that, the gameplay is getting stale. You can only get so much run out of the specs and classes. I build expirement/test and so forth. There isn't much left for me to meddle with. They went past the point of diminishing returns in balancing/tweaking the current spec choices. They messed with Chrono so much that they kind of killed it. That's a good sign you need something new. 
---
And if you've read the subreddit or anywhere else in the community, including Wooden Potatoes and such, most of the community senses there needed to be an expansion. 
---
It's clearly not just me.
---
The comment says sales dude. Sales are revenue.
---
And the gap it took to make the best xpack the game has ever had. Why not just make another xpack? What were they doing for two straight years before the layoffs?
---
I haven't seen anyone say they were expecting them for free. Some might have, but I doubt a lot of people did. In the communities I'm part of, or was hanging around during the announcement (twitch streams, raid/fractal discords), a lot of people were prepared to pay for some kind of Season Pass.
---
It took 2 years to get the next set of elite specs after HoT, so at the time it was reasonable to think that 2 years after PoF, we could get the next set. Personally, I was hoping that they would all be ready and released together. But in any case, I think most people would prefer whatever release cadence ArenaNet could manage ( one or a few every episodes, etc ) than none at all.
---
Core Tyria: The Straits of Devastation has one of the best-paced metas in the game. It really feels like you're leading a charge into Orr. 
---
HoT: Tarir... tagging up, starting at north and working your way round the whole map, gathering people as you go is just really satisfying. DS is great for epicness although I Laranthir said "ley energy" less often.
---
I really like the Istan Paladawan raid, although farming it has rather killed it for me. It's varied and well put together. The Kourna one is short and sweet.
---
yeah I just relogged and it worked, idk why I didn't think of that earlier
---
Being mocked and ridiculed for your appearance while doing your job is something no-one should have to deal with. If employees treated a co-worker the way those commenters treated that employee, that co-worker would have a legitimate HR complaint to make.
---
Employees are not punching bags for your entertainment. Mocking someone's appearance is one of those things that a respectful community doesn't do. Your bar is for what's appropriate behavior and treatment of other people is too low.
---
It's been 7 years. 
---
You know what you are getting by now.
---
i upgraded my laptop to win10pro to see if i like it, my laptop can easily play gw2 in ultra settings, but i play on my desktop.
---
win10 keeps updating during play, minimising my game and requiring 3 clicks to get back into the game. i made a lot of organisation changes to prevent updates, but they still happen.
---
win10 just hasnt sold me as a gaming platform, i have stuck to win7 on my desktop because it is very stable and clean.
---
Wish the game had more low barrier to entry challenging solo content like Liadri or WoW's Mage Tower. They were both fun and difficult challenges requiring practice and granted decent rewards.
---
That's every company ever.
---
If we don't get armour with nipples, huge codpieces, and fantastic butt shots, I'm gonna be disappointed.
---
So what's the alternative? No one spends any money at all on the game? 
---
It would have shut down long ago then.
---
That and the Olmakhan "opposition".  Still have their Kids raised in something Fahrar-like, but they also live with their families. 
---
For all we know, preventing cubs from seeing their parents could be very unnatural for charr and just a thing enforced by social Situation.
---
There really needs to be some better indication of who the fuck some of these characters are, because while the art is charming it really doesn‚Äôt tell much visually.
---
oh HELL YES
---
&gt; win10 keeps updating during play, minimising my game and requiring 3 clicks to get back into the game. i made a lot of organisation changes to prevent updates, but they still happen.
---
I've been using W10 for years and this literally never happened to me. It's set to be updated automatically and I only realize something has updated once I turn off/on my computer and the update is applied during boot. If you upgraded from a previous version, some old setting might be conflicting.
---
You might want to dial back your safe space circle a bit there.
---
Yes. But those people at the top won't keep a game going that brings in no money. 
---
They would just shut it down. 
---
All you are describing is corporate management in any company.
---
My girlfriend who recently bought PoF (and therewith HoT) has the same issue. The gemstore doesnt see she has HoT. Thus cannot purchase living world season 3. (In addition to glider skins etc)
---
She can start HoT story. She can make a revenant. On her account it says she owns HoT. But nothing in the gemstore HoT related is available.
---
We want the living world season 3. She can't get it..
---
I still think it is bizarre that people dont realize GW2 is ultra-casual and mostly social in nature.
---
They demand more hardcore raids or pvp content that most of the playerbase would never touch, blissfully unaware there are other games that cater to those demands (of course, GW2 raiders typically cant handle raids in other games so...)
---
Yeah ‚Äúsuch communication! Much transparency!‚Äù
---
by playing off and on, including a year off.
---
&gt; If a newcomers asks me if he should join gw2 I give a vague no and explain when he or she should or should not join. I don't say "yes this is the MMO. Definitely give it a try" anymore and list its strengths alphabetically which makes me sad.
---
^ this makes me sad, ive sunk 4k~ hours into this game, i want when my friends ask me "is gw2 good?" "Should i check it out?" to tell them "yes its very solid rn" but i said that rn i would feel like im lying and this makes me very sad.
---
OP, please!!
---
This got me more excited than the 45 minute presentation.
---
That announcement was definitely a "mist" opportunity.
---
https://twitter.com/Gaohmee/status/1168606141145743365
---
its based on the crafting profficiency level needed to craft the food, the wiki page of the composter i linked has a table that shows which level ranges give which output exactly.
---
I simply went with consumption level to determine their prices because you can sort your filters on gw2bltc by consumption level but not by crafting level.
---
Sanity.
---
gw2 casuals: what is Arah?
---
I still dont get how it being a simulator not focused around fractals dungeons raids etc allthat jazz excuses the lack of cadence.
---
No, we are aware the game has become increasingly casual - but you have to be delusional to not realize that the game was sold with pvp and wvw as core components.
---
So you prefer drama posts, complains and such? We don't. Bye!
---
I LOVE gw2 AND FFXIV... But if the two game types would merge it'd be literally perfect.
---
FFXIV :
---
raids and duty difficulties
---
Linkshell system
---
Houses
---
Trusts
---
Retainers
---
Gw2:
---
classes 
---
Pvp
---
Wvw
---
Glamour/wardrobe system
---
...glamour's overall...
---
Dying ability!!! (Choosing what color to dye each section of the armour)
---
There's more but what a great start.
---
Excellent, I can certainly make that happen for my guild. Thanks!
---
Sure, that's fine. But you can't ignore or not address the fact that y'all are acting like a bunch of tools.
---
I'm a huge PvE player and I love playing Living World and I'm also disappointed at the lack of information and how the reveal was over hyped, much of which is of my own doing. I should learn to tame my own expectations as should you all.
---
But y'all suck more than A-Net by acting this way.
---
I‚Äôm an ffxiv guy who came over for awhile.   Just tell him he‚Äôs right.  There isn‚Äôt a lot of depth.  The story isn‚Äôt nearly as good, and it‚Äôs missing a little of the creativity that the Japanese put into their storylines.  But it‚Äôs a lot of fun, it‚Äôs not nearly as grindy, it has some the most user friendly  crafting and inventory,  it scales well and encourages helping low level players, and most importantly it‚Äôs free.  That‚Äôs really the biggest thing.  No monthly fee so you never really feel trapped to keep playing.  It‚Äôs like ffxiv lite.  Won‚Äôt mess your life up with huge time commitments.
---
Plus, WvW is unbelievably fun and unique.  Ffxiv has nothing like it.
---
Truer words have never been spoken before.
---
I would like to play something new in gw2 thank you very much
---
Maybe if the community wasnt a bunch of entitled shit bags with pitch forks. It's a video game if you dont like it dont play it. People have no right to criticize to a point they can cost people jobs. Again because they are a bunch of whiney cunts.
---
&gt; WvW and PvP being neflected. For years now ANet has failed to communicate on any of this. 
---
We literally just got updates about both these game modes and both the updates were about things we already knew about. Clearly they are communicating about WvW and sPvP... there is a thread on the forums right now which follows a similar one a few months back with proposed balance changes asking for feedback. They are communicating literally right now.
---
&gt;  And this is where the discussion should be, not about death threats, toxic comments, and division within the community.
---
It must be a nice luxury to not wory about those things, but for people who experience death threats, harassment or abuse, not talking about it only creates an environment for it to thrive. We should demand better from our own community and we should expect better from ourselves.
---
It definitely feels like maintenance mode here. Perhaps the recent fallout would've accelerated it even more. We don't know. But i am sad
---
Paying for your friend to stay??
---
Lol that‚Äôs too desperate man.you don‚Äôt keep friends by giving them gifts.
---
lupi and alphard had me stressed with those close calls
---
I've invested 6 years &amp; several thousand hours into this game, it's been a part of my life. I have every right to criticise it &amp; the direction it's taking, if i don't like it.
---
The fact that you're trying to say I'm not allowed to voice my opinion, regarding something iv loved for so long, and then going on to call ME a shit bag is just.... Ironic to say the least.
---
Your hypocrisy genuinely amazes me.
---
We have death threats. Fucking. Death. Threats.
---
Well. Gotta start somewhere, but they definitely lied about "raiding for a year"
---
Communication is a strong part of it. Take bethesda for example. One thing they did really well was how they let everyone know elder scrolls vi would be coming and a rough timeline in terms of games between release.
---
Anet on the other hand would rather leave everything vague like expansions for example when they know very well if that will still be a thing or not.
---
I just hope it isn't that much family drama as it is boring AF.
---
Increasingly ?

Dude....It was super casual to begin with. Every content was literally a spam 1 zerg and nothing besides legendaries required the minimum amount of work to obtain.  
---
With HoT came difficulty and, besides the contet drought period, it drove away a lot of players that were too "casual" to learn to play a bit properly to navigate HoT.  
---
PoF softened up the situation a bit for the open world etc, but LS etc also managed to release hard instanced content, from fractals to raids.  
---
So, I can agree that GW2 had a small set back from HoT to PoF, mainly in the open world section, but GW2 was never hardcore to begin with, and time only did good to de-casualize the game.
---
lol he plays on his own now for the masteries and stuff, but before it was just too expensive to get those things so i just got them for him. i dont think he would have quit but it def helped him move along with it
---
It's not unintentional.  Picking out the most negative statements (or creating them) and using them to delegitimize the opposing side has been an effective social manipulation tactic for *decades*.   And it's far, far easier then discussing points or sharing information.
---
The comment is incorrect. The 13m is taken from NCsofts earnings report, which accounts for only the amount of money that NCsoft received from ANet.
---
Sorry think I'll stay and put annoying entitled twats in their place.
---
Path of Exile hasn't been relevant since 2013 or so? When D3 players were upset about how D3 was essentially a P2W, untrue successor to D2. That's great that a small company has that sort of freedom, but these comparisons need to stop.
---
yeah but gw2 mounts arent that compairable to other mmo's both in function and variety availability.
---
You get the archetypes by playing but if you want to costumise them or find a diff look for them then the only option for you is the gemstore.
---
Wow and ff14 have alot ALOT more mounts available through gameplay, collections, drops, prestige rewards etc.
---
I wish speedrunning was a bigger thing... It works better on raids, but still awesome to see on dungeons too.
---
I wonder if some kind of "fractal tournament from 1 to 100 see who's fastes" would work, and how long it would take.
---
thats cause theoretically you are higher than you should be.
---
The fact you don't pay a sub and you can play the base game and opt to buy xpacs and missions (which are 90% of their cash store offerings, not cosmetics)?
---
It's not about quantity, it's about quality.
---
I just quit my raid static and got wow classic. my static is imploding. 
---
jawgeous left, teapot left, nike left. you'll notice these people played multiple modes as well.
---
I just came back two days ago from a 5 year break.  I think the funny thing to me is, this is pretty much exactly what the community was doing when I left.  There was a ton of complaining about the state of the lack of content and the first expansion hadn‚Äôt come out yet.  
---
So I started up the download because I‚Äôm between games at the moment.  Checked out lions arch to see if it was rebuilt or whatever.  Went online to see what was happening.  Holy shit.  I mean... I almost decided not to play the game and uninstall it immediately.  
---
But, instead I sat down and played a bit.  My 8 year old asked me what I was playing, so I let him try it.  I think that gave me a good perspective on what GW2 actually is.  It‚Äôs a pretty good game for kids when you think about it.  No blood, gore, or R rated themes.  relatively simple mechanics.  Easy fights.  I think that‚Äôs what I didn‚Äôt like about it 5 years ago, but my 8 year old LOVES it.  He‚Äôs been playing all day.  I had to make him stop.  And he doesn‚Äôt know how to manage inventory, or even pick up loot.  He just runs right by it no matter how many times I tell him to pick it up.
---
So I guess it comes down to your expectations.  If you‚Äôre an 8 year old, GW2 is the best video game in the history of the world.  If you‚Äôre an adult, you‚Äôre probably expecting more because of the way they approach the marketing of the game. 
---
It‚Äôs still fun to play, and gameplay and systems are designed really well.  It‚Äôs just, without the grindfest aspect they really need a constant influx of content.
---
Again, wrong, since it's not the "shitty community" doing this, it's a few idiots with little capacity for thought.
---
If you gave a shit about those people you would just be sad they had to work overtime to fit something into the game before release to please fans. Crunch time is notirously bad in the video game industry (https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/dec/14/new-union-video-games-workers-launch-uk-game-workers-unite) and it's really unhealthy for workers.
---
For the record, ArenaNet has also had devs that have been very passionate about the game to point that they have done overtime to get things into the game before they released.
---
It says a lot about people's entitlement that the expectation of a good dev is people working overtime to please gamers.
---
&gt; We literally just got updates about both these game modes
---
No, we got those updates earlier last year.
---
honestly people are just fucking stupid...we knew it was new living story episode so all we needed was story direction and why got that.
---
Interacting on this sub is now a liability for the devs. The mental health of their employees is something they actually need to worry about now because people are so shitty. We did it to ourselves.
---
And the people who make me want to play are gone. I don't play mmos for a single player expierence
---
They only talked about the first 2 episodes and the Prologue. There wasn't enough there to really say there ISN'T expansion level content, there wasn't enough past that point to talk about.
---
I've been taking a break for most of 4 years now, only occasionally playing. At this point, the next break will be permanent.
---
Everyone who plays wvw has the expansions, lol.
---
Nuuuu i want there to be actual connections between maps
---
But I've seen on reddit that pvp has healthy population. We should all just be positive because negative opinions are hurtful. /s
---
Ah fair enough, I meant hardcore as in when people call raids "hardcore".
---
Though I do think Anet wanted PvP to be super hardcore but the rest of the game more casual as you say.
---
&gt;But for some reason unknown to me, people wanted more from a Living Story chapter..
---
Because they booked more time for the event than the PoF presentation, only to use the extra time for youtuber-like merch peddling.
---
Was that an attempt of an insult?
---
&gt; All ArenaNet needs to do is ignore these people, but by responding to them they're just spinning everything into a political statement, and provoking them even more. 
---
It's easy to say the guy having rotten fruit thrown at him should ignore it when your sitting in the stadium next to the people throwing the fruit. It's much harder to ignore it when the fruit is being thrown at you.
---
Pretend for a second we are talking about people here. They shouldn't ever be expected to deal with harrasment or abuse or anything less than respect for another human being. This should be easy stuff for the community to stand up for. If people could just do that, while also making their complaints in good faith, this would be a lot better.
---
Y'all are so desperate to turn a blind eye to mistreatment of other human beings because you think it means you won't get your written letter of apology if you acknowledge that unacceptable behavior is taking place.
---
I'll let you in on a secret - your criticism will be no less legitimate if you also call out the disrespectful or harassing behavior. In fact, you will make it easier for someone at ArenaNet to read your criticism if it's not constantly paired with attempts to legitimize the harassment ArenaNet is receiving, or if you make unwelcome the people who are not giving feedback in a constructive manner.
---
&gt;Rubi: "our great GW2 community"
---
&gt;&gt;you: "she says the entire community is toxic"
---
So either you havn't seen them because the mods are doing great work or you have a very different threshold when it comes to what counts as harassment. Because I have seen dozens of clearly harassing statements and hundreds that were clearly over the line, even if not outright attacking specific people.
---
For power DPS it depends on ths fight and if you take on average 1.5k damage per second. The general rule could be to use  the lifesteal food in general scenarios for the scholar uptime if you are not getting too much damage in. Even for condi DPS that could be worth for general sustain (also following the same 1.5k damage per second). But for example I would say that on Dhuum you are most at risk of the bombs (damage spike) and right after the soul split (when you are not usually able to hit the boss much) so I would say that the -10% damage would be more interesting there.
---
How do you suckle with closed nostrils?
---
I've been on the internet a long time. When you focus on the crazies, congratulations, they've won.
---
They aren't serious, they aren't calculated, they are malicious and rabid idiots spewing vitriol at anyone within earshot, but most importantly *they do not care about anything but getting attention.*
---
Sure, for a while this tiny and spiteful group makes a neat little shield to hide behind when the community at large is upset with something you've done, but you can only do this so much before people start realizing you're just "what about"-ing them and leaving the actual issue to fester.
---
Death threats are so easily lied about, so difficult to verify, and so hilariously prevalent on social media that the moment I hear someone complaining about death threats I instinctively take them less seriously. No one with a lot of internet experience is genuinely rattled by a handful of practically-never-credible threats sprinkled into thousands of upset voices who disagree with you - it's just seductive to try and redirect the upset horde against an effectively imaginary evil instead of actually discussing the problem with people like rational humans, because that might make you uncomfortable and might, maybe, possibly, conceivably mean you have to admit you were wrong.
---
As unpleasant as it is to imagine, if someone genuinely wants you dead, how likely do you think it is that they'll have the courtesy to contact you about it beforehand?
---
If you *do* play the game and "complain", people will tell you to just quit; if you *have already* quit and you "complain", people will tell you that your complaints aren't valid. So then what? It couldn't be that you just want one big happy echo chamber without any criticism at all, right?
---
As to the announcement‚Äìjust no. It was underwhelming even for a LW announcement; they basically told us *nothing*.
---
Likely because that's what it's labeled as on the world map. But that doesn't meanvthe capital is there, or that small area is *all* of the Blood Legion Homelands (the latter is what lore implies).
---
I'm telling myself[ that's a troll](https://i.imgur.com/s3AOB9f.png) because I don't think I could handle other explanations well
---
Puh ... my poor heart.. :)
---
And right here, we see exactly what he and the OP were talking about: People trying to divert attention from the actual problem by focusing on the tiny amount of crazies going berserk with insults and death threats.
---
Thank you for proving both of them right and for accepting you're part of the problem.
---
So you're gonna let a couple of hundred (out of the thousands of fucking players) stop you from playing a game? That's the problem. That's the problem with developers, and communities. You let the 1% dictate everything. You let them control the conversation, and you let them control the outlook. You will NEVER remove those people. They will always exist. You just act like they don't. They do not represent the community, they do not represent the developers, and they do not represent the morale or feeling towards the game. That being said you need to understand that showing discontent, anger, and frustration is not toxic, and it is not bad. Anet needs to be told that what they showed was bullshit and underwhelming.
---
Nice to see a positive post
---
&gt;  players are free to do what they like between boss encounters.
---
Unless they want to maximise keys. Dragonstand is a better example of rewards incentive allowing players to freely do what they want as long as it's contribute. The machetes (DS keys) are given out as the meta progresses to different stages (waypoint unlocks, towers reached, towers cleared, Mordremoth defeated) and they are given out equally to any playing with participation. This frees me to spend my time helping the fight in any lane at any event without having to rush away to tag another event.
---
Dragonfall gives a key for each event completion (I believe three four a few of the "bigger" events). This creates an incentive to tag as many events as possible (without finishing them because that's wasted time) to obtain as many keys as possible. It also makes players angry at other players for "finishing events too quick" like the bridge event.
---
&gt;They only talked about the first 2 episodes and the Prologue. There wasn't enough there to really say there ISN'T expansion level content
---
You do know this means over a half of year of content right there, right? If they didn't say anything now, at the start of the Saga where this would matter the most, they quite simply won't do it later on.
---
Yes
---
In the 15 years I've been involved with Arenanet, they have never, ever, communicated with their community well including during the sporadic times when rabid members of the community insisted they did. 
---
When you have a sec like Arenanet who communicates in anyway that aligns well with the expectations they set, you can't act surprised.
---
Is there a ruleset you are following? Since u didnt want one shot lupi with wall push and reflect
---
It is not the responsibility of a community member posting feedback to verbally admonish or atone for threats and insults that they had no part in creating and cannot even see for themselves.
---
"we'll do X thing for PvP/WvW"
---
We've heard that for years and they do either nothing or barely deliver.
---
Of course not.

I would never mix up anything, sir. How dare you?
---
What? In any case, the mods would know who's spamming the system with false reports, and avoid the actual harassment some users are getting right now.
---
Or are you by any chance implying anyone aside from the mods should see who is doing the reports? Because that's pretty dumb, not a single website out there does that, and no one ever said it should.
---
&gt;  I presume this to be a relative increase and thus almost worthless overall, possibly even working like magic find where you only get upgraded into a different loot table. 
---
That was my assumption as well but it turns out to be wrong from my observations the other day. Forgot why I went checking.
---
I checked it on soft, hard, elder and ancient wood.
---
It gave 2 stacks of 1 log not 1 stack of 2 logs. The highest I've seen so far was 5 logs with one tree and this without any booster or glyph, just the guild boost and sometimes banner.
---
&gt; Guild boosts and banners aren't worth paying for.
---
If you mean the unlock then that is probably true although it depends on the size of the guild but once unlocked it doesn't cost anything except loading time.
---
Disappointed by the lack of big charr ass at this big ass charr party.
---
Game is too far into it's life cycle to justify adding another 10 or whatever specs to balance. It's not pretty but that's the cold hard truth of it.
---
I mean, ok? Death threats happen for literally fucking everything. Let's not pretend like this is the first time it's happened. I'm not saying it's ok,but realistically, what the fuck are you, me, or anyone going to do about it? Nothing. There are thousands of players all over the fucking world playing this shit, playing wow, playing ff14, etc. They make death threats over simple small dumb shit. This happens in every "community." But acting like the entire fucking community is saying them, and backing them up, and acting on them? That's the problem. You will never rid yourself of the gigantic toxic pieces of trash that thinkt he game is so important that they write dumbass death threats. You report it, and ignore it.
---
&gt;The (certainly existing) constructive criticism has been overshadowed by the behaviour of seizable parts of the community.
---
No it hasn't, here AGAIN we see you specifically trying to make it far worse than it is. If you bother to check ANY of these threads here, Twitter or even the forums, you will barely see any bad behaviour.
---
It's people like YOU that are making this worse, trying so desperately to make the bad part of the community seem far bigger and having it "overshadow" the legit criticism, which IT IS NOT DOING.
---
Like many adult humans with fully formed brains, I am capable of holding more than one thought in my head at a time. I can say I want an expansion or elite specs while also saying that abusing ArenaNet is wrong. It's not just the death threats, it's bad faith criticism, it's people selectively ignoring things ArenaNet has done to argue they don't do anything for certain game modes, it's mocking the appearance of their employees, it's insulting them by saying they don't know how to do their jobs, it calling other member of the community the enemy because they don't want the same things as you etc.
---
Adult humans are capable of holding more than one idea in their heads at a time. I don't lose anything by calling out abuse or destructive behavior, my feedback isn't any less valid. I genuinely don't understand why people find it so hard to separate the two things rather than treat them as mutually exclusive - no-one at ArenaNet has done that.
---
Okay, you're being rude but for some reason I couldn't stop laughing at this.
---
I'd say you've got the area for the prologue chapter about right, although I suspect the map will end up being a bit larger than what you've outlined - based on the size of the maps of S4 the new one should stretch to cover all the lakes in that part of the world, encompassing pretty much all of the GW2 Charr Homelands.
---
Moving on from there, I get the feeling you've got the general layout and route right, but the maps are far too small; if ANet wants to make a modern version of Dry Top they're going to need to stretch it out quite a bit, otherwise the area of the map devoted to each episode is going to feel small compared to what we're used to. If we use Bitterfrost Frontier as a reference, I'd expect each S5 map to be at least three times as large, maybe even larger, whereas your ideas are only about twice as large at most, which is actually smaller than many of the S4 maps.
---
I'd also be very surprised if it ended with some sort of confrontation between Jormag and Primordus, unless in so doing it doesn't end definitively for either. Unless ANet wants to stretch S5 much longer than they've done for previous seasons, up to 8 or even 10 episodes, then in terms of narrative pacing it would make more sense for the events of S5 to lead into a climactic battle with Jormag at the end of whatever comes after it, either S6 or a new expansion. Taking out one or more Elder Dragons at the end of S5 only really makes sense if you want to get through all of them as quickly as possible and move on to other things, and from what they've said on the topic in the past ANet decidedly isn't in that camp, as popular as it may be with some members of the community.
---
They basically did that in HoT with a Sylvari Commander and Canach. Some of their dialogue can be read as flirty, I‚Äôm not sure how the male VO voiced the lines but Jennifer Hale definitely made it sound like flirty banter.
---
DR has the musical players, BC has the CAH players, always there.
---
&gt; I should learn to tame my own expectations as should you all
---
Or maybe Arena net shouldn‚Äôt hype an annoucement weeks before and start a livestream in a rented theater only to show us less content than previous episodes? They even started their stream 48 hours before to start a timer to hype us up, geez.
---
Cant blame Anet alone...the community have a big share of the blame hrre....wintraders, cheaters, hackers, bots, you name it, Anet didnt force players abuse old Guild Rankings or duo queue too wintrade easier, plateys did it, many sitting at high ranks, which are the ones that most bitch about it...people just got tired of this shit.
---
"Creeping influx of cash items" wait when was that supposed to have happened? Pretty sure we have a slower cadence of cash shop items than we had 2 years ago.
---
&gt; They never had a dedicated server (bless!)
---
O, I can see that chat cesspool filled with Cyrillic script. "*XAXAXA*"
---
Actually, and i can't believe i'm saying this, it could've worked here.
---
The problem is that the actual content isn't worth it in the end, it's quite short and there's way too much being funneled into the Gem Store over and over and the money from all of it wasn't being funneled back into the game \[and you ALL know this, it got to the point NCSoft had to step in\]
---
i wouldn't be surprised if some of the worse trolls are actually shills on alts, like a [false flag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_flag) or something. it wouldn't be the first time it's happened, there was a tumblr post a couple years ago that called for a war on 4chan's /b/ board and to post progressive messages (anti racism, lgbt etc) of course 4chan won, but it turns out that the original post on tumblr was made by someone from 4chan in the first place, they just wanted to kick the hornets nest (/b/) for fun.
---
As someone who was super involved int he game and community for a long time, but isn't anymore a lot of the tweets and talk about the community have been confusing to me. The community has it's problems, every community does, but overall the community seems great from what I see. People are keeping good discussion at the top, not 'game sux now uninstall' or just the angriest people. 
---
Gamergate couldn't get a foothold in this community, and it wasn't for lack of them trying. I had accounts flagged that where trying to make this subreddit another GG battleground. I downvoted them, but I was far from alone. They easily brigaded a lot of gaming spaces on reddit and this community quietly and resolutely said no. People whose only gaming was GW2 were able to keep on without even being impacted. This community's dedication to good discussion and no bullshit squashed the brigades that easily steamrollered nearly every other gaming sub I was in the time and y'all should be damn proud. 
---
I wish I could spend more time here and in game, but due to an injury I need to strictly limit playtime and can't do stuff like fractal anymore. Teaching fractals to new players or people who found them intimidating used to be one of my hobbies. I miss it. This community is great and I wish I could still be an active part of it.
---
PRAISE
---
i mean we are only waiting for spvp at update and alliance wvwvw for 2 years...
---
I said it that way because you said grind for ranks, which implies that your doing it for the ‚Äúrewards‚Äù ranks give, and their defenently is a difference in play time (not at my computer atm so I can‚Äôt check) but that‚Äôs more because I started playing in high school so I had a lot more free time then cause I wasn‚Äôt a very sociable person, but my point on crafting still stands, you can look up a guilds for crafting, and armor smithing only cost 80g (if your buying ALL of the materials) at the time of posting to get to 500, which you should assuming you don‚Äôt spend your time afk‚Äôing in la would at beast take one of these multi-hour sessions of yours, or just a week of causal gameplay as I currently only get a hour or two to play nowadays and I can normally get ~40g (this is by playing wvw only)
---
&gt;If you want to complain, great, turn it into a constructive argument.
---
I'm sorry, but that's just not how it works. Not everything has to be a "constructive argument"; expressing *emotion‚Äî*be that disappointment or positivity‚Äîis a perfectly legitimate use of this subreddit.
---
&gt;Don't come into another games forums
---
Talk about gatekeeping.
---
If you don't gather from the nodes, you'll never need to replant them. Get alts to gather from them or have your friends gather from them. You won't get them on your account but never have to replant again. Have your friends share the wealth with you for providing the nodes.

My reaction to this post, people are still playing GW2 in 2019! Wow!
---
&gt; the only response from the company so far has been telling me that I'm the asshole for having this expectation.
---
When did they do that?
---
So in your mind, if I pay to play once and then support Anet by buying Character slots, Bank slots and other upgrades for my money I‚Äôm still not allowed to complain about how lack-luster the future is just because the content is given to me for free? Even if someone has bought HoTs or PoF they‚Äôre still not allowed to complain? *This* comment is a prime example of how to not treat the community, *this* is toxic behaviour that prevents quality updates.
---
&gt;Like many adult humans with fully formed brains
---
Unfortunately, you're not one of them with how hard you white knight ArenaNet and do exactly what the OP said, wanting to focus on the tiny amount of toxic idiots \[which will NEVER go away, welcome to the internet, took you long enough\] instead of focusing on the problems that have plagued the game for years.
---
You keep saying people selectively ignore things ANet has done, while both you and ANet themselves selectively choose what to respond to and what to ignore. Let's not forget here the "what's your favorite quaggan?" thing, which DID happened.
---
Saying the same thing over and over again isn't communicating.
---
Pretty sure some of them are, along with some of the "hey, i just happened to arrive now, is the game worth playing uwu?" posts. It can't be coincidence that every time there's a big discussion or controversy, suddenly there's an influx of these posts.
---
I‚Äôm not denying that toxicity has sprung up, but the frequency of it. I‚Äôve been looking over r/guildwars2 for a week now and I‚Äôve found many more constructive posts or comments than toxic ones. In addition, the toxic ones are usually downvoted as well.
---
If you look at the history of this game, it's "biggest" moments have always been controversial, nearly nothing positive
---
I mean at this point most of us who are frustrated aren't concerned with helping arenanet unless thing change. I'm certainly not encouraging anyone to play this game at the moment.
---
There's not much choice to be honest, it's just same food effects with a 3rd bonus effect which are mostly irrelevant for dps.
---
We‚Äôve always been on a path of fire
---
She needed to be fired. No company that takes money from players should pay an employee to bash those same customers.   She was 100% in the wrong.
---
&gt; If you only do things alongside people and never interact, that's your own fault.
---
No no no, not a fault but a choice. Not everyone wants constant interactions.
---
Hmm true. Thinking about it, since the territory we currently see in the game is all Iron, it might be that only Iron legion does these excessive metal builds, whereas Blood for example goes only for some metal reinforcements. I definitely think it's a cool style though, especially the parts in the back behind the archway and to the right look very interesting.
---
It's really common online for people to even create alts to send death threats to themselves.
---
LMAO how is enraging the most loyal part of the community ‚Äùpushing the right buttons‚Äù? The only thing pushing is my credit card back in my wallet.
---
Literally this.  It's like no one does the math and expects that 215,000 subbed people (plus the ones that don't sub) aren't going to shit out a few god awful comments here and there.  Obviously this isn't an endorsement of those comments, but just a fact.  There's literally no way to prevent this from happening
---
Not that it would ever happen but it sounds like a bimonthly "devstream" similar to the devs of warframe (Digital Extremes) would help the company and the cummunity alike. While guild wars 2 and warframe share the similar, issue of a content drought, at least in warframe players always know what the roadmap is as well as what is and isn't in development. Surely something like this would increase the good will people have towards the devs; I don't really understand what counter argumet they have.
---
The corrupted weapons are jormag skins lol. Also that skin is based on the og icy dragon sword from gw1
---
I had a speed running team up to a couple of years ago and we'd use every wall glitch, AI exploit, and trick in the book to speed run every dungeon, in order, each day and man - it was an absolute blast. I miss those days; when ANet announced that they were discontinuing support for dungeons my team was so demoralized most of them quit for a good couple of months before coming back, but we never ran the dungeons again like we used to. It really felt like speed running any game - master mechanics, figure out tricks and glitches to drastically improve run time, and keep pushing and drilling muscle memory to improve times. We were a speed running guild in GW1, so naturally it was kind of already our thing - a lot of them still play GW1 for that reason. 
---
I definitely wish there was more fresh content to speed run, and a larger speed running scene for all content, not just raids. Personally I'm kind of done with raids after legendary armor and don't really have much interest in the legendary trinkets, but reinvigorating dungeons with in-game monthly leaderboards and some superficial rewards akin to PvP would be incredible.
---
I think they are trying to rally the company morale and reset things from the layoffs. They are probably doing the best they can with what they have. If at the time of layoffs they didn't have an expansion in development (or it was very early in development) it's not like they can make one in six months while restructuring their development teams.
---
I think it's fair for them to hope people would be excited by the direction of the story, a norn/charr expansion was actually talked about with great enthusiasm on this sub a few months ago, many people expressing a preference for it over Cantha. A lot of people actually were and still are excited by it. Lots of people got caught up in the hype for elite specs (and subsequent disappointment) but the overall feeling for many was positive.
---
I really think the event was an attempt to drum up some excitement and coverage for GW2 and it worked. They probably would have benefited from someone popping in early to clearly state there would be no elite specs once that ball started rolling.
---
Kinda what inevitably happens when player vertical progression is largely halted and mobs are continuously updated. This is probably still manageable for the most part, and not really too imbalanced, but powercreep *does* work both ways.
---
you‚Äôre wasting your time - pointing out that this community is relentlessly negative, often towards devs, will only get you accused of being A Shill. I‚Äôve seen comments wondering if rubi should get jessica price‚Äôd for, like, saying harassment happens and is bad or whatever
---
And barely anyone plays a single mode too. We're all in this together, like it or not.

Yeah... what have you done.

I need to work tommorrow.

It happens all the time, and these last years have been awful.

Of course, many of them are just "conspiracies", but when there's too many coincidences, something reeks.
---
They should add a final tier of it with only a title, and have that title just be "Fractal."
---
Can we just get an expansion focusing on Jasons nipples?
---
They gave the date of the prologue path. It's September 17 when we can go to Grothmar for the charr party.
---
I do agree it was a bit details light. They mentioned cool rewards from strikes but no details about what they are, it's also unclear about how they think S5 will be different from a regular season (returning to previous maps is something S2 did). I also think it would have gone a long way to tease concept art or story hints at the next raid and fractals (assuming they aren't far enough along to use gameplay footage).
---
Dismissive and uninformed about what?
---
Actually, the problem is echoed in the intent of people right here on reddit. Most want to know if there is some kind of magical hype train to get on or if they should just quit the game entirely. All the "respect" paid to a business doesn't amount to $$$ in the bank, and the game needs a sustained population so that certain content slots keep being filled. In other words, we need a critical mass of players, and Anet coming out and telling you you'd have more fun playing someone else's game isn't exactly good business sense. Their PR will continue to relate the good and smother the bad until the day they officially unplug the servers. Asking them to shoot themselves in the foot because you have nothing to tear the goal posts down about isn't very practical. If you are already considering quitting, do yourself and everyone else a favor and commit to a break period. Come back in 3-4 months and see what's happening.

I tink you will not have the chance to get the shirt skin if you get the HOT for free. Shirt is for the ones oh realy pay for the HOT xpac. Thats me tinking. Not 100% sure.
---
Using his logic, if someone sends a stupid message on Twitter or to your phone, even if you have dozens of good messages being sent, you should focus entirely on the bad one instead of continuing your day and listening or enjoying the good ones.
---
Hot take: gw2 is in a maintenance mode for at least a year now
---
That's not a hot take.
---
90% of the game, in my vision the races would be able to be played in  their own story line, interacting more with there own race and sometimes with other race (giving us more a view from their side)
---
Bit by bite more access would be made available but the beginning would be just be story and the season they came from, we have to start from somewhere right?
---
It's clearly unintended. I wouldn't expect it to last long in the game.
---
&gt;I was disappointed in the announcement, I wanted an expansion or elite specs. I also think the anger is massively overblown and the abuse (and dismissal of abuse) is real and should be called out.
---
Well, I think the anger is real and should be called out, and I think the abuse is massively overblown, if real at all.
---
While I fully understand the overall community's response to the announcement, I have gone back and looked at the email they sent out, the blog, and tweets. Aside from the 48 hour countdown, they were explicit in that the announcement was specifically for the next chapter of the Living World.
---
I definitely feel they made some missteps with the announcement, but expectations outside of the Living World Story were almost entirely created by the community. We have to be better about keeping our expectations in check, especially expectations that venture outside of what the announcement was officially supposed to be about.
---
Didn't change the fact that they didn't address things that the community wanted to know, but the simple fact is that they had a huge reorganization and layoffs just 6 months ago. Looking back at my jobs and team changes in tech the last 10 years, when you're new on a team or been gone a while there is a timeframe needed to get back up to speed. On average, that alone takes ~3-6 months to do (in my experience). Sometimes shorter, sometimes longer. Factor in that they were spending time reevaluating their plans and probably didn't do a lot of actual dev for a week or two (no, we devs don't spend 100% of our time writing and testing code/features/etc) - again a guess based on my experience - expecting them to deliver what they HAVE is miraculous.
---
I would guess that there's even a chance that ANet themselves didn't want to do a big announcement for this either, but may have been pressured to by NCSoft. I could be wrong, but I'm under the impression that after the layoffs, NCSoft took over marketing duties for GW2. This opinion is strengthened by the fact that the merch guy during the presentation was from NCSoft, not ANet.
---
As for the future of GW2, I think that the gamedev community is starting to catch up with some processes in traditional software Dev and IT practices..... One of those being fewer, if any, large releases (outside of initial release) and more frequent, but smaller iterative releases. Gets content/features/fixes out faster, tends to be more stable than large releases, tends to be easier to find a root cause to a problem when there are fewer changes to look through, and (most importantly) creates a faster feedback loop from customer to company (I chose not to use the word community for a reason). And before people talk about that being a bad idea, there are years of studies and evidence to support every claim I just made about shorter release cycles.
---
Finally, all of this is just based on my experiences in tech, what I've seen from ANet, and my own opinions. I could be completely wrong/off base.
---
Medium Legendary Armor looks so cool on Charr.
---
Fractals are not a gold farm? Running daily fractals nets you nearly the same amount you got from running dungeons back in the day. What other reason do people even run fractals other than that and gear? 
---
I am not sure how Arah was a failure, could you please elaborate on that.
---
Well, I don't typically make much gold because I'm not focused on it. I play about 2 days a week and the last thing I want to do is a focused resource grind. I get boosts in gold from the random one offs like finding a rare exotic or something. But as for grinding out that profession, I'm not sure if I 100% believe you. My friend was actually following a leveling guide and still spent quite a bit of gold. Idk, I'd have to micro analyze what all went into it. I leveled my crafting more naturally at a casual pace over the years. It helps that most of my crafting was sitting at 300ish when the end game material market crashed super hard. But I digress, the importance of what I was trying to say was I think a little bit of introspect is in order. Going back to my WoW days, I was always a bit of a hardcore raider, pushing lead content. When the Ahead Of The Curve achievements started coming out, I was always getting them done on time. I'd dedicate days off to learning boss fights weeks before they were released. Around Legion when I quit, I found myself bored with the game. I was ONLY logging in for raid nights, and only to raid. Nothing else was worth my time, and I didn't even enjoy the raiding unless I got an upgrade, which by the time I was done I only needed one item in the game which never dropped. My guild at the time had cleared the content on release night on Normal and pushed several Heroic bosses that night. We had heroic done by week 2 or 3. The point I'm making with all of this was that I lacked self awareness. I was focused on one goal so obsessively that I failed to notice that I was the problem with the content. Of course, Blizzard groomed us to be like that with the RNG nature of progression in WoW, but ultimately the fault is mine that I wasn't enjoying the game. I've drastically reduced my overall game time and now enjoy games at a slower pace, and I find myself not running into the same issues that you are talking about now.

&gt;And right here, we see exactly what he and the OP were talking about: People trying to divert attention from the actual problem by focusing on the tiny amount of crazies going berserk with insults and death threats.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Thank you for proving both of them right and for accepting you're part of the problem.
---
But you don't understand! Content is not the problem! Those pesky Russian troll superbots are! They came here with their toxicity to destroy us!
---
The price of peppercorns has dropped about 10% since this morning, and likely more than that from the evening before.
---
No. Secret World has been in maintenence mode for years bow. It's evidenced by literally no patches existing at all.
---
Declining release cadence is not maintenance mode. It may be a symptom of impending maintenance mode, but the game still gets regular updates.
---
It is actually people like you who fuel the fire!
---
King of the Jungle - for boss design.

Scarlet Mecha Maid (Marionetta?) for steping on me.

Kudos
---
Go find me any piece of launch era promo material that presents the game's vision as "super casual"
---
That was never the intent, the playerbase drove the game that way with this weird carebear attitude that the game somehow unintentionally cultivated
---
Yet they seem to do that all the time. Wvw mount during alliance work is basically what you're describing.
---
I'm more of a rational person and expect updates to happen more than once in 1/2 years. If they cant bring new content, they could at least push balance patches more frequently since it's one of the easiest type of content for end game.
---
I've made a promise to myself to not recommend gw2 unless the person asking is hardcore casual or a rper. It hurts to get so far and then run into a wall.

I don't mean to berate you or anything and I'm glad you bothered asking but it's a shame that this is seen as a controversial take considering how insanely easy the information is to find

**Third gender**
---
Third gender or third sex is a concept in which individuals are categorized, either by themselves or by society, as neither man nor woman. It is also a social category present in societies that recognize three or more genders. The term third is usually understood to mean "other"; some anthropologists and sociologists have described fourth, fifth, and "some" genders.
---
Biology determines whether a human's chromosomal and anatomical sex is male, female, or one of the uncommon variations on this sexual dimorphism that can create a degree of ambiguity known as intersex.

I mean, everytime I had to give a presentation for just my class or my college project where 100ish people came to watch. One of the main thing every teacher/coach or just normal person gave as advice was look decent, this doesn't mean wear a full suit, but just wear normal/casual clothing that still looks respectable. As someone who wears ripped jeans 99% of the time, I would never give a presentation in ripped jeans because it's not fit for a presentation.
---
Same goes for tshirts that have way to busy designs on it. The fixation of the presentation has to be on the presentation and NOT your wardrobe unless it's a fashion presentation.
---
This guy is the VP of marketing, he should realize his outfit is not fit for a professional presentation for thousands of people. I do not condone bullying, but imo having a laugh at a blatent mistake he should not have made isn't bullying atleast growing up we often made jokes about stuff people were wearing in my highschool and people knew it was banter.
---
Many of those food items have other sources of demand, such as Drooburt and other achievement sinks, or are just white quality which can't be salvaged. Many festivals will likely be a good time to restock, sure, but any depressed costs will only be temporary.
---
&gt; It's people like YOU that are making this worse, trying so desperately to make the bad part of the community seem far bigger and having it "overshadow" the legit criticism, which IT IS NOT DOING.
---
The only thing all of this is doing is show everyone how ArenaNet would rather spend resources on scummy tactics instead of being upfront about the problems.
---
Why would anyone trust them if this is how they deal with problems? You can't keep shoving garbage under the carpet forever.
---
On the one hand, sure. On the other, I‚Äôm a very story focused player and seeing the announcement had me super hyped. Then I came here and found a bunch of people throwing full on temper tantrums. While there‚Äôs lots of VERY valid criticism going around, I personally am seeing so much vitriol thrown at the devs and it feels really crazy toxic. As such I also really get the discussion about the community‚Äôs behavior.
---
I‚Äôd love to see a real roadmap and better clarity as to what‚Äôs next, don‚Äôt get me wrong. But seriously, the behavior is a big problem, and I think ANet is happier to be open with us when a premiere place people go to discuss their game isn‚Äôt filled with arguments and bitter anger. They‚Äôre coming off the back of a seriously rough time for them as a studio and I‚Äôm eager as anyone to find out what they‚Äôve got in store, for real. Here‚Äôs hoping they listen to that part.

Strictly speaking of meta and removing any monetary gains from a meta, Dragon Stand for me.

Some of the story bosses and particularly achievements require that. And of course I do run Fractals and dungeons, just not daily and not hard core. The point is I am playing with other people, we're usually on voice and usually coordinating.  Even for just stuff like bounties.

Thank you for the links, explains the abundance of light-roasted coffee on the trade post. I hadn't actually made the food yet, was just looking into various recipes to get a sense on how much I could expect food to cost in the future. Point still stands that the compost will become more expensive, especially as the ingredients of the more popular choices increase in price.

What controversy surrounding destiny was that? The one with the stealth xp nerf?

I think you missed our party yesterday. Or you may have seen it on lastest u/gw_fox video.
---
Plenty of people still playing. Most of the content I'm doing I get done quite fast. And there are more metas events than ever, more zones than ever to divide the playerbase and they still all get done.
---
Diversion and gaslighting. If Anet keeps pressing on playing victim in this situation, they'll keep losing my respect personally.
---
.... one should hate how Anet has "steered" the conversations.....
---
You shouldn't?  Good grief, 10-30 hours a week on a *single game*?  What a waste of a life.
---
Money ain't the issue.
---
Can‚Äôt wait till people stop posting so much about this :/
---
I had already decided to keep an eye out for the next sale given they regularly put it on at least 50% discount or so, but it depends on how and if they nerf the multi-harvesting. If a party of five can still do a full harvest than it's likely worth it.
---
This subreddit.
---
Nah, just kidding. I like the Silverwastes, but it‚Äôs hard to find a large enough group to do it with sometimes.
---
&gt;I have gone back and looked at the email they sent out, the blog, and tweets. Aside from the 48 hour countdown, they were explicit in that the announcement was specifically for the next chapter of the Living World.
---
You're acting like this is some sort of hidden arcana knowledge nobody could have possibly posseses before sherlock holmes came along.
---
We know it was going to be for living world, the issue is that they hyped it up and they said that the new season would include expansion worthy features.
---
All this ontop of keeping us on the dark for 6 months and ontop of all the hype they built.
---
&gt;but expectations outside of the Living World Story were almost entirely created by the community. 
---
No, they weren't. Anet themselves said that following season 4 the game would immediate go into 5, and that it would include expansion worthy features. This is what people were expecting. Expansion worthy features as announced by anet themselves multiple months ago. A new mechanic ala gliding or mounts or new elite specs.
---
This is not the community's fault.
---
Always appreciated.
---
If you have RES, start flagging those people you see posting those messages. You will very quickly notice that they pop into nearly every thread spouting the same things over and over, and massively contradicting themselves constantly in an attempt to defend ANet/the game.
---
It becomes harder and harder to think of them as anything other than shills.
---
It's just a diehard whiteknight, you can check their older comments they are all of this type.
---
&gt; I talked about the whole episode, Sun's Refuge was only *one* point. Ignoring the rest, because it doesn't fit the own argument is a bad move. 
---
Ok, lets talk about the whole episode, which at this point I barely even remember since I haven't been back since skyscale.  
---
World boss: Barely, its the end of the meta for the map and not really that interesting imo.  
---
Sun's Refuge: Sucks.  
---
Armor Set: Getting a free set was good I guess. Never thought about making another one. Adds on to the fact Sun's Refuge sucked.  
---
Everything Else: Was there anything else in the episode? That's how irrelevant Jahai was after doing the story once through.  
---
ANet could've talked about LITERALLY anything that they were going to add that they thought was expansion level content and people would've been happier than they are now. "Oh were adding especs at some point in the saga based on the lore developed" BOOM people talking for months about what they could be. "There's going to be a raid at some point tied directly to the saga" BOOM predictions for months since we probably have at least 6 more before we get another wing going at their pace. "New features coming like x y z eventually in the saga" LITERALLY anything. But they didn't. And that's why a decent bit of the community is peeved.
---
Because they have always been against subscription models. And say what you want about Anet they stick by their principles.
---
Why do you think they have problem with money?
---
The fuck you want me to call each side then? Good guys and bad guys, huh?
---
They can all go into a pit and kill each other for all I care. No one who tries to infect a community with politics is on my friend list. What about yours?
---
I look at this and can't help but think this is ANet's attempt at emulating the legendary Elite Tauren Chieftains.
---
What you should do, is not try to profit off of your fellow players.
---
To add to this, you will likely be doing the PoF metas anyway for amalgamated gemstones, either to avoid paying for them (which takes a lot longer than doing the metas for the elegy mosaics), or to reduce the amount you need to buy.

I don't know, why are you against expansions then? ;D

If memory serves me correctly,  the golden scarf was bugged on release and people could sell it.  It was never intended to be sold.

&gt;deformities
---
Congenital abnormalities do not equate with red hair, the fuck is wrong with you?
---
I really don't understand the attitude that when sharing your home instance and nobody pays you for it, you consider it "mooching". 
---
Half of my whole motivation behind getting a full home instance was to share it with other players, the key word being share. I just don't understand that expectation of reward for it, it's just weird to me.
---
No, it's literally just a term created by those who are anti social justice... So by using it, you're actually making political statement
---
This should have been the Challenge Mote tbh
---
Why don't those devs say then "ignoring all those death threats, can we address those suggestions and feedbacks that our best community made"?
---
Everyone seems to praise how good of a community gw2 has, but as soon as there's some important topic, they all seem to forget that.
---
My two paragraphs is monumental amounts of efforts over your passive aggressive stream of question marks and snips. 
---
&gt; lets have a cucumber gender for all i care. 
---
Pointless. There's no compromise to be had here when one is as convinced as yourself.
---
Istan at release was alright .
---
Arah was a failure in that no one played it and it wasn't worth the dev time. Fractals actually have difficulty settings and remain interesting.
---
Regular rational people would raise an eyebrow at a cucumber gender.
---
Well, yes. I was just curious.
---
This is it. I'm surprised there are still a few of them left on the TP if that's the case.
---
No but they should do a Gem Shop season pass where you get a bunch of stuff for a flat amount.
---
How do you think most of the money comes from buying expansions. Most of the money most likely comes from gem store skins. Most recently that's mounts. How many mounts skins do dedicated WvW players buy, by comparison. If you're a PvPer you're probably using standard models anyway to cut down on lag, and skins would be meaningless.
---
They come from Norse mythology, but the game tweaked their original characteristics.
---
I was just wondering if anyone could name an animal that they resemble in the real world.
---
I guess now‚Äôs not the right time to ask for a better Mac app...?
---
I think a subscription would be great if it's just a bundle of gem store goodies on discount steroids.
---
Never said it was their intention. It was probably a mix of factors imo.
---
They tried to rewrite the genre by not giving it the trinity, while the game was and is popular for that, at launch they just weren't able to give the game a valid "path" to follow for the combat....which got refined with time and culminated with HoT. They understood that a total lack of trinity is impossible for a meaningful encounter and thus pushed support roles, healers and a tank for extra tactic needed in raids.
---
They had a big lack of experience with such a new system. They had the idea, but didn't know how to evolve it in a proper way, plus the whole game needed a big skill/roles etc restructuring to create a proper enviroment for the new gameplay. 
---
They probably also needed to rework the AI to not follow you around corners, but instead they just decided to avoid obstacles inside places where you have to fight, thus not risking to break the game while fixing the problem.
---
So there wasn't much of a super casual attitude from the devs, the game was just ridiculous gameplay wise....and when everyone can clear stuff by smashing their face on the keyboard, it's normal that everything looks casual. Since there's little to no skill involved.
---
The rest is pretty much the standard setup of any MMO. Nowadays people want stuff, they want it now, they want it for free and they do not want to put any kind of effort. Everything gets dumbed down after a bit because they know that the casual players want to get on par and so on.
---
Plus, the market speaks clearly...Even if not at it's apex anymore, this casualish approach pays off much more than going for the old "hardcore" route....look at how wildstar ended.
---
Value is and has always been the issue.
---
Mount Maelstrom in Gauntlet Gulch, just north of the \[&amp;BI8GAAA=\] Forge Foundations POI there's usually a few Verdant Herb nodes around that greenery.

I wanted to know if they resembled an organism in the real world. All the other species in the game did, so I wondered why the asura apparently do not.
---
That would be a matter of opinion. However,  he isn't wrong. In game or out of game we encounter people that rub us the wrong way. Ask anyone who does customer service. This doesn't mean we need thought police.

---
....That's.....not....F2P....
---
F2P means there is no cost to play. At all. It is **free** to play. GW1 was, and still is a retail game where you purchase CD keys for the content. You know, like, all other retail games on the market. 
---
GW1 Arenanet was pretty much a masterpiece - that's not to say it didn't have flaws, but the company wasn't even 10% as money-grabbing as they were even less than a year into GW2. They cared much more about the actual gameplay, end-game content, and players first.
---
GW2 is a game where you kinda have to set yourself goals. It gives you very much sandbox like freedom at max level.
---
i think you cant buy it either, there are in the tp because the people who post it havent take it out, i was never intended to be sold
---
That's basically what the supply drops are already.
---
When did I say anything about enraging the community? Check your eyes man, I'm talking about hype. H.Y.P.E. And the resulting self made emotional crash.
---
you mixed dragon fall for dragon stand XD
---
Tried too hard.
---
I invested in my home instance for three reasons: 1) Completionism. 2) The home instance provides long-term benefit. 3) Very quick thing to add to a daily run and effectively auto-completes 1 of the 3 daily achievements each day.
---
Guests that I invite into my instance are benefiting off my time, effort, and invested resources. It's basically a 'service' that we instance home owners provide, and while some share their instance regardless of any return I feel my time can best be spent else where rather than waste it twiddling my thumbs for people that rarely even offer a 'thank you', let alone a tip or some form of compensation.

We asura, too, like to "party." Eternal Alchemy? More like [Eternal Rock-my world](https://imgur.com/DrQDy1e), now featuring boom-boxes!
---
Unfortunately GW2 isn't really an MMO or a RPG. It feels like a single player, action, story and collection game.
---
If that's the only target then why have they released any raids at all?
---
That's nice, honey.
---
If you think raids are out of place, then you have a poor understanding of the game's development pre and post launch, as well as the history of the franchise.
---
It's a bunch of deflection. In the end either the game thrives (though at this point I think most folks would be satisfied with it merely persisting as it is today in terms of activity, whether that's "thriving" or not) or it fades away as the player base continues to shrink.
---
Based on the apparent mismanagement and lack of vision that ArenaNet continues to demonstrate, I'd bet heavily on the latter happening over the former.
---
Continuing to demonize the "community" and treat all negative sentiment as unfounded and ill-conceived will only make the game's failure more certain and more imminent.
---
Seems like pokemon community when the national dex controversy hit. Don't worry, once it's out everyone will play it.
---
Well...it's just an outfit...I mean. They just wanted to put something cool mist related, nothing more.  
---
I mean, we also had Canthian outfits much before...zodiac stuff that is never seen anywhere (beside the weapons that are from gw1), timekeeper stuff is added randomly and not even related to chronos....they're just costumes. Defiant glass is another random stuff....oh, and wings much before.  
---
The game had plenty of stuff that isn't lore-justified since launch xD I don't see why quitting with the Mist stranger outfit.
---
Actually GW universe is pretty well developed, especially compared ot other genre-mates, in this type of prehistorical / biological lore - were not told everything by word, but what we see usually makes sense when held against the rules of nature. F.e. Tyrian "bats" are not mammals like those on earth, but draconids; youll rarely see multiple species of predators that share the same food source in the same area; the way Sylvari got their human appearance, and their "original pourpose"; etc... 
---
My guess is its likely linked to the development of elder dragon lore, or maybe theyre just really into that stuff.
---
He just deleted his account lol.
---
Goes well with all threads that got deleted earlier. Some people are either very bad at trolling or just pathetic.
---
You suggested that the amount of occurrences  was negligible, so me pointing out that it was in fact dozens if not hundreds is not a strawman. And while yes, ANet is not a person, devs working for Anet are. So while attacks that target individual devs are especially vile (and there have been several, as pointed out before) attacking the devs as a group e.g. by calling them thoroughly incompetent or even calling for their firing is not a critique of a company it is an attack of one or a set of people working for said company.
---
And I don't midn doing what OP was reffering to, since I have stated my position that we do in fact need to talk about the inexcusable behaviour that parts of the community have succumb to while other parts have failed to make clear that it is in fact inexcusable .

When you wait 10min for a match you're going to get matched with people 200, 300 ratings under/above you. Even if you're the god of your class and win every fight you go into, you can't be everywhere at once. If your team loses everywhere else, you'll lose the match.
