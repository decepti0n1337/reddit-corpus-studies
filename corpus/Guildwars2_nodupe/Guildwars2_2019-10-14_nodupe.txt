Dude that looks BRILLIANT !!!! love it &lt;3

You need t3 raptor to get springer/skimmer and t3 springer/skimmer to get jackal.
---
Any valid PoF key will unlock HoT. Key word being valid.
---

---
G2A is iffy on that front and as a result you stand a good chance of having issues like a ban if you buy a key from them. A lot of how they get keys is through stolen credit cards and other nefarious methods.
---
I am quite busy since my school just started the fall term, but I’m part of a friendly and helpful guild I may be able to invite you to! I’ve been friends with some of these people for years and they’re wonderful people. You may not be able to get the same person every time you want to play, but it could be one of your options?
---
It will appear soon in the Black Lion Statuette merchant. Save the statuettes you get from opening chests for another rotation or two of featured items at the merchant. This outfit will be 60 statuettes.
---
Oh man thats excellent !
---
I dont know if the AMA is still open, but how is the wiki funded? Something I love about the GW1/2 wiki is the ad free nature! If it is funded by ANet, what kind of regulations must you follow, and how much freedom would you say you have in the wiki?
---
It is not possible to put yourself in a situation in which you can't reach more mastery points and get stuck. You can get the communing with places of power, with open world achievements, and with event achievements. 
---
The chapters that gives Volatile Magic Resonance gives access to more mastery points than needed for it.
---
Go to your achievement panel and look for the purple mastety icon. 
---
If you register in GW2Efficiency and set an API, this link will show you all the PoF masteries you are missing and could earn:

Now do Quackatorrik

Best loli that i know !
---
Well... Are you in t4s? If so, you can practice in lower tiers. Sorry, maybe unpopular opinion but I don't think it's unreasonable to expect people to know mechanics by the time they get to t4. Lower tiers everyone else is in the same boat, so don't worry about that.
---
1 million gems!
---
Slut.
---
Warrior, Guardian, Ranger, and Necro all have very easy Power-based builds.

More like a crowd of kids begging for candy
---
Omg I need unsee  this :'(
---
Technically you don't even need endurance, you just need mirrors up because those will trigger mirage cloak too.  I'm not sure how common target breaking is on other professions or how well it actually works on mesmer (never seems like it works correctly for me, but I'm not sure if that's the skill bugging out or if it's just good players), but maybe one solution would be to give a trait for non-mesmer professions that causes target break on dodge *or* give *some* evasion skills the ability to break targeting?  Breaking target this way wouldn't shatter clones, but would at least require mesmer to retarget for the clones to start chasing again.
---
About ur theory, then skyscales are digglets? Roflol
---
Do we really want an elder dragon to consume more?
---
does the ebon vanguard shoulders box drop from the physical chests that spawn after the boss or from the bouncy UI event chests after the boss?
---
[removed]
---
i agree - no idea why people are downvoting, they must be missing a huge chunk of their brain - also legendary armor. it will be totally pointless to have it now no?
---
Is this the legendary blue eyes white dragon?
---
the story instance will 'belong' to whoever starts it (they'll be in control of decisions / talking to npcs / appear in cutscenes etc). but as long as everyone who entered is on that step of the story, they will be given the option to advance to the next step when the current story instance is completed.
---
Ninjazzy - I'd be happy to join you and your guild ^_^ my discord is Angry_Radish#2844 I'd give you my in game name, but I'm on my phone right now and don't remember it &gt;_&lt; 
---
As for posts and videos that map controllers, they aren't detailed enough or they assume you know more than I do. I'll check the post you suggested, but I'll be honest, I'm cautiously optimistic lol
---
&gt; Which is odd, because the Dragon Bash Festival only mentioned Zaithan's death, not Mordremoth's AFAIK.
---
The latest one mentions both and Kralkatorrik's.
---
Which is another thing about ArenaNet's treatment of spoilers. Dragon Bash this year was celebrating the death of Kralkatorrik, while Festival of the Four Winds had many mentions of Aurene - a spoiler for Season 2, Heart of Thorns, and even Season 3 content. It also mentions the Zephyrites crashing in Dry Top and even the Master of Sun's death during Season 2. There's even dialogue between Ellen Kiel and Evon Gnashblade about her meeting Zalambur in Elona.
---
Those two festivals, especially Four Winds, are downright *stuffed* full of spoilers.
---
What did you do to this poor guy?
---
Problem is the newer fractals(Sirens Reef and Aquatic rework) are horribly made/balanced. I always tell my static both these fractals are always one tier above what you're doing. T1 sirens? It feels like a T2. The balance on them is so bad and its what makes them really unfun. Also if you get T4 Aquatic with bad mistlocks it is 100% a T5 or possibly T6. It really is that brutal and I've seen so many pugs add it to their "skip list" because its not worth the hassle.
---
Mini Zuzu, Cat of Darkness. +1
---
not really.
---
for spinger all you need is a friend or random player with mesmer portal. you can even just teleport to friend.
---
It definitely started as ink focused but a lot of people do it as a "draw a drawing per day according to inktober prompt lists" regardless of media choice. Still lots of ink out there, but non-ink works still sort of count.
---
This wasn't phrased like they participated tho, just as commissioning art *because* it's inktober. Might've found a nice deal because of the occasion?
---
I love the CMs and wish they would make more, there's some amazing fights there.
---
No.

You will have to buy another account, because chances are you will get yours banned.

Awesome! I’ll be home from work soon and I’ll try to get that started :D
---
I beleive it's just the bouncy chests.
---
Kinda in a rush so I'm only gonna answer 3 but focus is a better condi weapon and dagger offhand is a better power weapon, that's all there is to it. Focus Fire 4 and 5 are really really good and dagger fire 4 and 5 are really really good, focus for condi and dagger for power.
---
You know you are supposed to give each person a unique color, so we can tell them apart. Right?
---
Just in case you got the dates wrong Halloween releases on Tuesday and Build Templates will release 2 weeks later.
---
Honestly your brain is amazing. Also, thanks for answering seriously. If I had asked the majority of players the same question I would have gotten the equivelant of a dry anal probing. You have turned me, I’m making my second thief a Charr. (Can’t delete my petit human female cuz she is just worth way too damn much X3)
---
It should not be taking that long. Did you get an auto response when you created the ticket? If so, check your spam folder they may have hit you up already.  If you didnt get the auto response you likely need to make a new ticket.
---
Looks like normal pvp interaction, pvp is basically the Dead Sea of guild wars 2, it has the highest concentration of salt in tyria
---
Hah, no worries.  It's a common train of thought that most people seem to follow.  Charr thieves are relatively uncommon, though became moreso after the Deadeye was released since a charr deadeye seems so thematically appropriate.  But I approach charr differant than many, anyways.  IE: My refusal to go bulky, and insistence on trying to keep the character as sleek, but stylish, as possible despite being male. XD
---
Great work. I should get back into drawing.
---
Firebrands can do a good job of providing party wide [quickness](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Quickness). Here is an example [power build for fractals](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand) that does decent damage while keeping up quickness. For raids the [power build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/power%20quickness/) changes slightly (changes runes to crit cap, you don't need the diviner pieces if you have a chrono using [SoI](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Inspiration)) but you can also run the [condition DPS build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/) as quickness hybrid and it will hit higher numbers power but again needs a chrono to help cover quickness. I don't suggest building the [condi quickness build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition%20quickness/) since it really cover caps on duration needed and uses different gear compared to condi DPS.
---
love this!!
---
&gt;Maybe they'll use the same explanation as they did for Primordus's changed look between GW1 and GW2. :)
---
The explanation for Primordus was "what we saw was never confirmed to actually be Primordus" (which was false but hey, interviews don't count anymore). But Drakkar was a nickname given to *what we saw* in EotN at Drakkar Lake. So they can't use the same retconing explanation.
---
Originally, the creature in Drakkar Lake was intended to be Jormag. But they thought it was too small, so they changed it (mid-EotN development) to being just a dragon champion like the Great Destroyer. Incidentally this was similar line of through used for Primordus' model shift for S3. Despite the GW1 Primordus' look being far more interesting when you see the details (no forearms or wings, but instead four tendrils; and four gargantual spike-like dorsil fins; implying that Primordus' GW1 model was designed for swimming, not walking).
---
That said, the "new Drakkar" look, looks a lot like the [ice column statue creature](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ice_column_statue), while Jormag's new look looks like GW1 Drakkar. Which makes me think they might be reverting their early development change, despite newer lore telling us Jormag woke up farther north than Drakkar Lake (well, except one NPC who does say Jormag woke beneath Drakkar Lake).
---
Given this model was recently added, it's likely to be for Episode 3 or 4.
---
Me getting ready for templates   
---
 https://imgur.com/0eSQplL
---
This is really good stuff! Look the griffon's eyes!
---
That damned Aegis that ruins screenshots again...
---
Equipment templates only exist in PvP, not both modes. Are you sure you played GW1?
---
So wait, Aurene is now a flying dog? What's going on with the legs? looks super odd.
---
I think it really depends on who picks it up and how much work they actually have on their hands.. I’ve submitted several tickets and sometimes they solve my issue very swiftly and sometimes it takes days.. I have had one time where it took 2 weeks and I just sent a “?” and that finally triggered them to answer me. Seems a ticked sometimes gets lost in the sauce and they require you to comment putting it back on top of the list again.
---
I really hope ANYONE that tells another player to "kill yourself" gets a serious ban. Fucking evil, shitty thing to say and completely moronic over something as trivial as a pvp game.
---
Yeah, in no situation is what he said called for. Report him and move on.
---
I am so torn on her resembling Glint a lot now. I mean, it's a very beautiful and elegant look, no doubt. But I loved her appearance before ascension, and I was hoping she'd keep it after as well. 
---
On the other hand, this model is clearly unfinished, so we'll have to see what else they're gonna add.
---
You never know what the future holds.. I started out as the casual partner of a gamer as well. Now I’m hard balling it and I have surpassed his achievements masteries collections you name it. He is also my ex now, so it’s extra satisfying to see my account and experience being much bigger. He’s the casual now ;)
---
If you scroll through enough of these Posts you will notice that New ppl are Always told its worth it even by the saltiest of veterans 
---
They understand differing viepoints from 0hrs palayed to 7000hrs played.
---
Hmm so $69 ... Niceeee
---
1k self dps loss or 3-5k more overall dps with rene running shiro or more stabs uptime if they run jalis. Which is the smarter choice?
---
Hey there! I'd love to join you whenever I'm on. Feel free to add me in-game Mogarc.2173. What timezone are you in? :)
---
Should be noted that if your playing condi dh actually does it better since the traits allow it to auto apply cripple and vuln whenever it applies justice passive or active.
---
Consumables are really a beautiful thing.
---
Looks good
---
Can you flip that card over and show me the CCV? ^^^^^^^^^^^^^Yes,I'mAwareThatThisIsAStockImageAndNotActuallyYourCreditCard.....
---
Once again I'm reminded that people think this shit looks good.
---
Fractals don’t follow the normal day and night cycles - they are fixed times of the day. Urban Battleground is a day-only fractal. Based on the wiki link you provided, it doesn’t look like it needs to be nighttime for you to do the achievement?
---
Wow! I can really tell which of the three armour weights you are!
---
Thanks ArenaNet!
---
Completely agree with this. 
---
The dots is super aids to see. 
---
I've been trying to get that damn concert fireworks one. By the time I can see the dot it's over.
---
I want this as a wallpaper! So cute.
---
The celestial infusions came out in July 2017. The Griffon skin came out in November 2017.
---
Oh god no. There is already too much target breaking in the game as it is... and that's JUST MIRAGE. Can't fight fire with fire here imo. Do mesmers have to re-target when the enemy is out of stealth in order for their clones to home in? I always assumed that wasn't the case.
---
Why does playing the game for a long time entitle people to cheap or free future content and features?
---
Oh wait. It doesn't.
---
You aren't a shareholder. You are a customer. This isn't a loyalty scheme where you can cash in NornBucks for discounts.
---
You forgot that the game can be "instance" depending on where the player is on the storyline. Changing voice over lines and characters is trivial for anet.
---
Naut! N-club lives!
---
It's worth slightly more to a player who:
---
1. Currently wants T5 mats, or ectos from the yellow gear (selling for gold and then buying back T5 mats wastes TP fees).
---
2. Does not have capped magic find (you get luck by salvaging, you get none if you sell on TP).
---
3. Has unlimited salvage kits from the gem store (costs a bit less to salvage).
---
4. Has not unlocked many of the commonish skins (you only unlock the skins by salvaging).
---
Identifying is no longer affected by magic find, that was removed in a patch.
---
So if all those apply to you, you should generally identify and salvage, if none apply, you should generally sell.
---
Eventho there was sarcasm implied.. in every joke hides a bit of truth. i actually know quite a few veterans/elitists who tell people to not play this game. And I get why, game modes are being ignored such as pvp. The rewards don’t seem worth the grind anymore for those who have “been there done that” . Maps and collections are dying because metas are not being kept alive.  For example to start the sw armor collection is a mind fuck of a grind now due to silverwastes not being properly populated. To many instances for a non popular meta. The game pushing us to purchase gems to get a mount skin the gold farm being pushed back to push gem to gold conversions etc etc. 
---
Understanding the annoyance and feeling like you don’t really wanna recommend that annoyance, will it really matter for a new player? On a perspective of collections and masteries? Yeah it is a more tough grind. But will a new player experience the game that way? No cuz they don’t know better. For a new player it is a shit ton of content for 70 euros/dollars total to have all expansions and living world seasons, going in there unaware of how things were. To them all is new and enjoyable. Someone who can still bring up common sense knows this, unfortunately not every veteran/elitist has this common sense. 
---
So saying “ no one of us would tell you is not woth” is not true. As unfair as it is, some will advise against it from their own perspective.
---
I think most people are misunderstanding your cumment vut you're right. My squad kicks people who join and only ping dps, that's just the jame of the game. I want people who can and will flex, and people who volunteer for mechanics because while mechanics aren't as hard as rotations, they are infinitely more important. Same goes for support roles.
---
Players have to show us they can carry their weight in more than one area and they're in. Otherwise they can find a pug who will take their type because they are useless to us.
---
Lazy route is just a notepad.  Definitely not going to pay for them in-game though.
---
My fastest i bothered to check was 58min (with one of the CMs being a daily too). So 3 more than you, and thats running with heals... Seems theres not that much difference huh?
---
Whats funny is that if you do not play the spec (you don't even have the gear for it) you are most definitely not qualified to teach how to play it.
---
Also its super cool you share your builds and stuff, but i seriously don't know what you want me to compare =/
---
As you said: " Everything is just tighter so you can't just afk and watch netflix on your second monitor. " I 100% agree with that, and thats why i wouldnt even dream about running with that build.
---
Id rather take 2 more minutes and have 100% success rate WHILE DOING SOMETHING ELSE, instead of tryharding the same content for the 1200th time.
---
If you have fun with that, more power to you... For my my way is much more efficient and fun, and i do not care to do it your way. Its just making the run harder for the sake of it, i couldnt care less if its 2, 5 or even 10 minutes faster (which is totally not, because i can consistently clock 20-25min for cms, and no, no one does them in sub 15 min because thats world record territory).
---
legendary armour has always been more of a prestige thing rather than necessary.. but I doubt they will become pointless, cuz I’d assume you’d still craft different sets? If you have all the legendary armor sets and most trinkets/weapons on you can just save yourself the coin of buying this feature. So it’s never gonna make legendary pointless, it will just be the cheaper option for those who have it not needing the templates or for who wants it for prestige or does not want to purchase/convert gems.
---
Looking awesome ! One idea to add that I thought of is that since we don't have horse mounts, that new deer/stag jackal skin is the closest you can get to a horse and you can dye it completely black. I think that would be absolutely perfect for this !
---
Cidd is obviously the MVP
---
Huh, in my experience, it's usually the supports who can't be trusted.  There have been countless times where I've had to slot stability myself on either my soubleast or guardian to cover for a support who's shit tier.
---
You say that but when they are constantly nerfing the fuck out of meta events killing the maps because they generate “too much gold”  and killing loads of collections for new players (or players who come back for a collection) to be done on dead maps. 
---
Adding no significant good worthy rewards, not even a single mount skin, unless you create enough alts to farm your 1 single precious little BLC key a week.
---
With killing the meta events killing the gold income you need to sustain the ingame rewards on those dead maps, pushing you to buy gems to convert in gold to get your in game rewards, or to have a skin on your mount that you can actually dye more than 1 colour mixed with an ugly combo of what you can’t dye. Or expand your bank in mats and personal to be able to store the very insane amount of materials you need because you can’t afford to buy them any time soon unless you convert some gems again.. etc etc etc
---
You’d think they are making enough microtransactions off of us to give us this one convenience a lil cheaper at least if not that being a one time global account bound purchase...
---
a 32 slot bag costs about 110 gold which converts into about 250-275 gems in value. so a bag slot and a 32 slot bag is about 650 gem value.
---
Fact is, most of the player base has put money in the game, years of patience. But they are not rewarding us for our loyalty that much. So for people to wish for a idea comming from the community to be not too expensive is not a weird thing to ask.
---
Airship and Bastion load alot quicker than Mislock does tho.. for those who don’t have an i9 with 2x RTX 2080 and 64g ram X3
---
There's always truth hidden in such sarcastic comments, it's just a way of ppl to save themselves Soo they can reply like that.
---
"Dude I meant it sarcastic, so relax."
---
I'm not stupid my mate
---
Looks lame, just another claw of Jormag like creature. The design preview at the 30 aug panel looked better.
---
Let's be real, can't even trust anyone anymore. Need to clone myself x4 times for a good party these days.
---
Stealth consumables also underrated.
---
Everyone deals with my shit just fine, because apparently i'm pretty good at the game (not that thats any accomplishment, you know... This game is pretty easy).
---
Anyway i play with an alacren friend (two actually, but the BS is not able to play for a bit) and we make our own groups pugging DPS.
---
Although we can all DPS fine and both my friends are way above average at it we prefer playing like this.
---
Also i have never once been kicked of a CM group when playing solo (and come to think about it, i don't think Ive been kicked from a T4 either).
---
So, i'll keep waiting, but don't hold your breath because it's been a few years and still didnt happen ;)
---
Outfits are bad now?
---
Ooh I get that, but still like I said, for every 10 downvotes you might at least make 1 person think. Not to mention all the people who read and don’t vote either way at all. Usually people tend to unfold tho when they are reading.  I do however completely feel you on the downvoting for the wrong reasons tho. I could not really take the point away from your previous post haha,  but I feel ya..
---
Don’t forget for holiday JPs to also use the scaled wings backpack and equip a Binding of Ipos in addition to playing a max size male charr and using an embiggening tonic.
---
Doesn’t solve the gear template issue. Can’t make a build without it being in gear storage. Unless things drastically change and you can use the ones in your inventory.
---
Don't  xD Once you start you can't stop....oh god please help me stop xD
---
technology and engine are not quite there yet.
---
Is your game installed on a hard drive or an SSD? The hard drive might be old and slow / dying and not loading the files fast enough.
---
Got past it with rev tablet first then diviner's rev mallyx second.  Also, projectile reflects/absorbs stop a majority of the conditions.
---
I am missing one axe and the sigils. Gliding would be nice to have. I heard the bunny jumper mount is „easy“ to get and usefull in HoT so that was my goal for now. My ingame is Emporio Istani. (account name is bugged atm)
---
You weren't kidding about your account name lol
---
Yeah, they just made perfectly functioning randomly-changing models for NPCs and then never ever released them to players.
---
I see no problem here
---
Yes. Fluoride.
---
Well, this is awkward.
---
Who's gonna tell them?
---
That one's from my [actual character](http://www.ideaura.com/eng/gallery/noir/13_noir_vinocacao_cosplay.php) tho.
---
Except I sincerely enjoy the game and was poking fun at the fact that this guy asked the GW2 if the game was worth playing. Other people can have their opinions, but I don't agree with many of them.
---
So you may not be stupid, but I also wasn't trying to save myself. I was, believe it or not, actually being sarcastic.
---
I'm guessing the AoE that turns you into a Moa that's centred on a player and follows them around until it goes off.
---
&amp;nbsp;&gt;:o
---
I really like how interested the griffon looks :&gt;
---
Since when is Silverwastes an unpopular meta?
---
Well, I hope you get your account back before Tuesday where the real Spooky Murdering will happen in the Lab! Good Luck out there!
---
Also as a seasoned player I can pretty much keep up a keep by myself. Easy if there is 1 or 2 other players till you have to go underground and the vine itself I can’t manage alone logically. I can tag up on lfg all I want but in an hour of lfg I might port 1 or 2 people in, or a small group from another instance. The meta itself is not dead, but too little players stretched around too many instances is a problem. Elitists/guild squads not switching instances to merge cuz they can do it with a small group and don’t care about newer players needing the help, or other people completing the event in general is also a problem. The communities on these maps are thinking more of themselves rather the community. It’s pretty simple to think, hey let me check or put up the lfg so we can make a full instance. A lot of people just don’t care anymore. Yeah seasoned players can still farm nicely there, but doing the masteries and achis there is not a fun task anymore.
---
I hate it when they put the skin in the randomized licenses. I've only 'bought' the Shrine Fox Jackal Skin. Since it was perfect.

she looks roughly the same size as the model they used for [Glint in All or Nothing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/File:Glint_render_01.jpg)
---
despite what anet says.. someone will put out a build saver  some where lol
---
We are waiting for your story
---
No
---
&gt; It’s most likely the games poorly configured engine
---
Sorry if I have to nitpick here but "configured" would suggest they could "configure" it differently and make it better, however, that is not the case because the engine has limits, in this case, it is mostly the main thread of the game that does most of the work instead of unloading certain things to other threads to not be throttled by certain tasks because they take longer. Which means, that it can't just be configured differently but those things are the baseline of any game and making changes to it is really time intensive and can break a lot of things if you suddenly lock up a thread because it waits to be synchronized.
---
Another thing is that d912pxy is not a fix but a workaround. [here](https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy) is the github page.
---
Because of wording like this, we have confusing statements that "profession X is not viable" that are really hard to get rid of.
---
here are the links to the wiki and how you can get those tonics that make you bigger and smaller
---
[Endless Embiggening Tonic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Embiggening_Tonic)
---
[Endless Miniature Tonic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endless_Miniature_Tonic)
---
This is obviously a support who's there not to actually support but because they think they can't be replaced.
---
Honestly, the only reason I am still doing fractals in GW2 these days is due to the 2 CMs. I dread the T4s at times, as any bad instabs will cause wipes at normal areas, which is just frustrating to deal with.
---
This is awesome af ! LOVE IT !!!
---
I once had to fight a fairly good core necro and I know what happened...
---
If you 1v1 this dude, you'll get stripped off all your boons, your stabillity will be turned into fear, add some more skills to inflict fear on their own and you gonna get feared until death. No counterplay. Core necro condi "bomb" isn't rly a bomb.
---
It's a painfully slow death, where you only can watch your chara die, with 0 control over it. THIS is a shit way to die and extremely unfun to "play" against. So I can understand the anger, but I can't support the verbal fallout. People gotta learn to controll their anger!
---
\----------
---
Ps: What made me fuming as well was the fact, that full counter would get interrupted by corrupting my stabi into fear, unblockable fear would be applied, when I tried to use my shield and 3 stun breaks weren't enough to exhaust the necros many options of applying fear. (point of view form a warrior)
---
No, you just will get banned
---
SYG and F3 tome should be enough stability.  The Elite mantra is only 1 stab every ~25s or 18.75s with alacrity.
---
Is this your art? Great job!
---
I dont have all exclusive and rare dyes...  but from my experience none of them really worked super well. I have all the common and uncommon dyes and those ones worked the best. I mostly used shadow abyss, darkness, glossy black, white or mithril for the second channel. 
---
Keep in mind lighting plays a huge part. If you use shadow abyss for the second channel, you will look less sparkly and more fleshy during daytime but you will look extra dark in shadows or at night. Using whites or lighter grays will give you a more consistent tone across lightings but you will look a lot more sparkly.  
---
Sunrise breeze and pastel pink look pretty pink in character preview, but in daylight look fleshy. I find pastel peach is the overall best one for most lightings. 
---
It all also depends on the skin tone of your character that you're trying to match. Pastel citrus works well for more pale skin tones. I also came up with some combos for darker skinned characters but I dont remember the dyes off the top of my head.
---
Was that double tonic effect achieved by having one of them in your inventory instead of in the wardrobe? I've never tried combining any before. Always assumed you couldn't.
---
Welcome to the edge of the world)
---
Probably because chasing someone that is hard to kill is a big mistake in any objective based pvp, there are ussually more important things to do like securing the objectives. Not sure if that was the reason your teammate was angry with you, but if I disagreed about this I just simply wouldn't follow you, so we might be missing some other context.
---
And this is actually how I turn and win most of my games. I bunker up on a side point and never die 1v1. Every second somebody is wasting trying to kill me in a 1v1, they are losing points, and I hold the objective. Even better if I can hold on 1v2 or make 3 people chase me while the rest of our team secures the other points. If they actually chase me, now that is really dumb from them, as I will ussually run in the opposite direction of where they should go. So if I see people doing that on my team, they are probably terrible (or just bad) too, but I wouldn't really call them like this, I would however emphasize to fight on points, and not slam your dick against a bunker wall.
---
+1 on this, get the dx12 mod, it boosted my fps from 15-50 to 30-120, also on a Ryzen.
---
"Up to potentially 60 items" because they count all upgrades on full asc/legy gear, full infused&amp; attuned, and the amulet enrichment. [That's exactly 60 items.](https://imgur.com/a/OQPemw7) And those take 19 spots in my inventory, underwater equipment included. It should cost less than a bagslot. It offers less besides "equip all" (which we have with arc), you can only store equipment in it, and if you can't directly drag&amp;drop it into your bank there's also extra inconvenience if you swap gear between characters.
---
Mmmm
---
All you need to do is to have a hot-key copy/paste buffer. It's not even against any ToS, since you only interact with your copy/paste buffer (which is not part of the game) and then use the regular paste to get it in-game.

This is actually amazing

Don't worry, technically it was aurene who ate/killed joko.

Does the mad King stand a chance against an undying elder dragon though?

They should just make all buffs removable by right-clicking them.  Iirc that's how WoW does it, so not unprecedented.

Well twelve-year old boys do.

Unbind the turning keys, set A and D to strafe, and keybind skills according to your own preference. You should be using your mouse to turn your camera for movement
---
Other players can moa you, and a lot of pugs don't SA key it. So sometimes you have to dodge/jump away from them.
---
If he was running really far from the point, no need to chase him. If he was just harassing the point, leave your support firebrand there to just hold the point and you leave, unless you can bunker the point and survive against this rev in which case you stay and your support fb leaves.
---
2 players being occupied against one guy without getting a kill is just bad.
---
it has a cooldown but it's not 10 sec with alacrity
---
yes you don't really rotate around soul barbs in fractals, you sit in shroud till you can use skill4 2nd time, and your off-shroud rotation is "get back to shroud asap"
---
corrupt boon is especially trash because NPNG boons happen as "chance on hit", it can appear immediately or be delayed by seconds. you're better of casting nightfal and WoC and have them tick so you can be in shroud on time. that's why you can have rene not go mallyx if certain conditions are met (short phases and at some bosses rene running absorption sigil to supply more corrupts when reaper cant)

Did you ever change runes and stats on legy armor? Short answer it's annoying as hell esp if you combine different stat combinations. The only thing that makes it good to use is without arc templates.
---
Furthermore explain me the prestige of pvp or wvw legy armor. They got no special skins. If their template "feature" is released like in the preview it's going to be bad. You paid the price for 6-7 armor sets and get less functionality yeah great job Anet. Why less functionality you ask? Cause quick switching armor without templates works just fine while quick switching legy stats and runes does not.
---
Perhaps it's the asura diet
---
In pve? No. In pvp? You can play an annoying tanky bruiser and it'll be fun sure but at a higher level prot holo and tools holo will get you farther. In wvw? You could go full dps and in melee clashes top the meter but people are pirate shipping really hard right now and straight up melee clashes are few and far between so you're probably going to be better off on a scourge/weaver/rev. Roaming its good at least, you even get to stomp people with the gyro sometimes and can be a ton of fun even in the usual days of slogging through nothing but soul beasts, mirages and thieves just trying to find a good fight I still have a good time because the class is so fun at least.
---
Lol. Some people

As u/rhetoricalgc said fractals always have a set time of day, but if I recall correctly you need to be in the Fractal at night Tyrian Time. Even though it will look like it's daytime in the fractal the game registers it as being night and you can get that part of the collection.

Yeah, how to edit pages would probably be the most useful. Maybe you could find a content creator who knows how to make video guides and teach them the basics about editing the wiki.

It could be a boon, if the guide creator also has little knowledge of editing the wiki so he starts with the same knowledge most players that would watch that video have.

You have to wonder what kind of state someone has to be in playing a game that they would say such shitty things to a random other person. If they told someone at work to "kill yourself" and go on a massive angry screaming rant about how everyone who works for the company sucks apart from them and they should all just leave and die, they would probably be sectioned.
---
The one where you start in Cliffside, then jumping platforms, defeat anomaly, run through snowblind section with tentacles and final boss is the legendary gladiator charr that you need to electrocute to get down his shield and who usually wipes half the pugs because nobody CC's.
---
Lmao I always wondered how his shield went down ... I usually ask if pug has cc or run for my life. The permadaze is annoying but daredevil can easily permadodge it and stay in range.

All in all not a very exciting frac tbh.

Ooh I agree the way palawa was was ridiculous.. but the insane rose quartz nerf was killing for the collection. I get why you think that I meant it that way. But they do really push towards microtransactions since there are so many failing metas.

People from around the world play Guild Wars 2. For most of them, the game is not presented in their native language. We localize for French, German, and Spanish because those gaming communities are large and there is a solid business reason for doing so. However, we do not have plans to localize for other languages. By the same token, we cannot accept and implement community-translated text, because verifying and implementing the input would be very time consuming and costly. (Consider that inputting text involves things beyond words -- it also can involve videos, animation, and more.)
---
We have received offers to do community translation for Russian, Hungarian, Czech, and several other languages. We regret that we are not able to offer Guild Wars 2 in every language, but doing so simply would not be feasible, even with the kind offers of the community.
---
I've talked to players from around the world, and I actually asked many of them what language they chose when playing the game. A surprising number of them, while they were native French, German, or Spanish speakers, told me they preferred to play in English. Most cited the opportunity to practice their language skills; some said they liked to play "exactly what the devs created." I hope that all players are able to choose a language that allows them to join in! - https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/307741/#Comment_307741

If you go to a bank you have a tab called Wardrobe Storage. In there you can search and preview any armor or weapon skin in the game.

If you look up the core condition engineer build, you replace tools with scrapper 1 3 3 and rob yourself of somewhere in the neighborhood of 5-10% of your DPS depending on vigor, swiftness, and superspeed uptimes. It's a terrible idea because core engineer would be higher dps and condition scrapper barely generates barrier; holosmith would beat both. From best to worst dps it goes: condi holo, power holo (about 200 dps apart, at 34K each), condi core engineer (32K), condi scrapper (29-30K), power core engineer (27.5K), and finally power scrapper (24K)
---
As far as boons, you can trait alchemy to provide boons based on conditions you cleanse, and you also natively provide stability (if you run elixir B instead of elixir R), protection, regeneration, vigor, swiftness, and small amounts of might.

No and it will probably never be, as Holo is intended to be damage focused and Scrapper is intended to be

We're talking here about Inktober I didn't once state OP said he participated in the challange or the original artist. I was using the OP as an example of an illustration.

Reading comprehension
---
Eh, I don't PvP so that's not really a problem for me.
---
Just saying doesn't apply to work such as OP because by every definition ever that is an illustration and not an inked piece ;)

Since your example doesn't apply to situations like these
---
People dont realize it but engi is actually good dps, better than dragonhunter or soulbeast after the first like 20 sec or so. Hard to understand why it isnt meta in any compositions with all the utility it brings alongside that dps
---
Finally! Nice work there
---
I see your mistake - you decided to play pvp in GW2.
---
Have an UpVote as I too support Hong Kong and am Boycotting Blizzard
---
Coming from WoW and doing PvP things Warr is currently the easiest to start with. Engineer next due to scrapper and holo being not hard to pick up. Last I would say Thief &amp; Rev are the hardest to play yet the most rewarding in terms of fun/accomplishment.
---
Hope that helps

Thank you. Someone told me ingame aswell and I sent a message to the support already. I hope they can fix fast :/

Then do it with a single friend on t1 difficulty

Quackotle?

You may die now

You got 7+ years of content ahead of you with new content being produced while you're working through the old one, the game is healthy, has 1-2 million players like 50 different gamemodes for you to dabble in.

Make your own decision.
---
Even dragons are not safe from addiction.
---
First mistake was taking the time to type lol when you potentially could have been casting more abilities
---
People like you are why I love my holo. I shit out CC like crazy whenever I need to and my DPS doesnt change, I can self-rez every 30 seconds, I provide my own fury and might, i have stability almost my entire time in the forge, and I even heal myself through heat therapy. It's nice when you have time for me but I don't need you as bad as the rest of the pug needs you
---
You are a dumbass for chasing around one guy instead of actually capturing points. And now you want some kind of self-approval in this echo chamber that you did nothing wrong. Fuck off.
---
Does anyone have experience with playing condi weaver on 250+ ping?
---
Squeezing everything into weave self is ridiculously tight, with less than a second left.
---
Is it something that gets easier with practice or do I have to live with it?
---
A couple times when as a pug we've shown real grit and determination to finish but we just arent getting it, ill be like, aight, ill go heal scrapper so we have a healer at all instead of no healers, and in those times, when someone dies, most of the time they say things along the lines of "sorry i ran off stack/didnt dodge/etc" which is nice cause i already feel self conscious enough as it is running such a thoroughly *not* meta healing build
---
Likely because of what he wrote about combat. There is litterally nothing more annoying then having a person looking like a nuclear disaster next to you. At this point it over all have gone too far and people are annoyed about having to wear glasses infront of their screen to be able to see the combat rather then the nuclear disaster. 
---
No offense meant to the person writing it just explaining why i think he got the down votes.
---
it doesn't matter what you link, the behavior in the game is one and only, and it's chance on hit. if you get lots of hits then yeah it's pretty instant. imagine adds on arkk (archdiviner/charr), if they would get boons as soon as they are hit then axe 3 precasted to hit as soon as they are spawned would immediately remove 2 boons. and it sometimes works, because its rng. and sometimes they get boons a bit later.
---
If you think you dont have to learn mechanics as a dps because the supports will heal and stability you through them, you're part of the problem.

Zhaitan's (final) model and Primordus' GW1 model, to clarify.
---
Only Kralkatorrik and Primordus were seen in GW1. Technically, Jormag too. But what was planned to be Jormag was retconned into a dragon champion (nicknamed "the Drakkar Beast" by Jeff Grubb and thus "Drakkar" by the community) before serious GW2 development on the basis of being "too small". And it seems they're retconning Primordus in GW1 into being a dragon champion too, under the premise that "we were never told it was Primordus" (which is incorrect, but it was Jeff Grubb in interviews who said that and ArenaNet is treating interviews and forum posts as throwaway lore - which means that their explanation for the dramatic change in model and size can be ignored when we revisit Primordus, too, which I hope they do because Primordus' GW1 model was fascinating af - no wings, no forearms, just four massive curved spines where he should have forearms, and some massive dorsel fin-like spikes indicating a body meant for swimming).
---
She's not supposed to replace Zhaitan or Mordremoth, nor do we ever actually see her use their powers. We don't know if Aurene actually consumed that magic from Kralkatorrik, if we're being technical.
---
Ultimately, established lore from S3 and PoF tells us that we will need multiple replacements to rebalance The All, and that Aurene cannot burden it alone. Hopefully they don't retcon that.
---
He's not wrong, even if he could've refrained from using an insult.

Lmao fucking Bondulance.

You're going off about art as a profession under a commission labeled inktober*
---
The other commenter is saying your definition of inktober is too narrow and you're defending it with an unrelated rant about art as a field. You clearly have a lot of feelings about this but they're really not relevant to the OP or the comment chain you posted them under.
---
I hope at least this time Arena will hear.

I'd argue that a lot of people create the legendaries mostly for the skin than for the ability to stat swap. That together with it still being profitable to create and sell legendaries I doubt it will affect the price that much.

Hey if i may ask a dumb question, how do you do 30 golds in an hour by doing a full Dragonfall Meta ?

What do you sell exactly ?

I think i'm not doing things right , do you open you unidentified gear ? Do you sell them ? Do you salvage them then sell the components ?

I know those questions has been already asked multiple times on differents posts, but i'd like a clear answer if you can take the time to explain me :)

Alright guys, i installed d912pxy and cleared my temps, and it seems to have worked!
---
Thanks a lot everyone who tried to help!
---
AFAIK, players ask for cyrillic-supported chat, not a translation.
---
This is beyond amazing!
---
Directx9 and AMD Graphics had some problems, as far as I remember.
---
At least thats what I know from running stuff in wine under Linux.
---
You might want to use dx912pxy, which translates from directx9 to directx12 or, even better on AMD hardware (in my opinion) use d9vk, which translates directx9 calls to vulkan and performs insanely good even on older AMD graphic cards.
---
Download the .tar.gz from the assets of this build:
---
https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/d9vk/releases/tag/0.22
---
You should be able to extract it with 7zip. Maybe even WinRar.
---
Put extracted files into 'C://Program Files/Guild Wars 2/bin64/', especially the d3d9.dll is important.
---
You can also rename the d3d9.dll to d3d9_chainload.dll if you are using arcdps.
---
This is how most Linux user tweak GW2 to perform well under Linux, but I found that it benefits windows machines which have graphics cards with great Vulkan performance.
---
Shat is still the hardest, just because its so mechanics focus to doge everything or you die on the last boss encounter. Chaos is perfectly design in my opinion, very
---
My advice is to get one of the packs like Branded or Mad Realms when it is on sale because then you get 1 new skin for all mounts basically. Better deal than 1 random skin that may look worse than what you have

And if you want to change one of the variants? You have to take the pieces out of the template, go the forge, change the stats and put them back in. With legendaries you can do this  much faster. and just change the stats of a piece with one click
---
Nah I agree. I WAS chasing the rev around a point he was trying to capture. I should've moved on as I did waste too much time protecting that one point.... 
---
That said... This interaction occurred literally during the last 50 points of the game (with the other team sitting at 200).

But yeah, I guess I should keep my light hearted-ness to myself during these cases lol... Lots of angry people I'm finding. Haha

Didn´t know eggs where this round, soft and warm  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
They will have to realize sooner or later they have to create some way to make 'replicas' of bound legendary gear so each character gets to use the legendary gear you bind to the account without constantly moving the gear between characters, as they are already account-wide.
---
Just a bit of adjustment so it's not possible to equip two replicas or the original and the replica for legendary weapons and trinkets that can be equipped in two slots at the same time until it's bound twice, plus a way to craft the collection-based gen 2 weapons again so they can be bound twice, and that should do it. 
---
Then legendary gear will remain just as serviceable for players with alts.

3D Ripper DX and Ninja ripper both give you textures for your rip. 3D Ripper will also maintain the ingame pose so you might want to use Ninja to make the rigging easier.
---
Another way to extract models is [Gw2Browser](https://github.com/rhoot/Gw2Browser). It will take some time to find what you need and you won't find your PC there because of the way GW2 builds characters. 
---
Small spoiler warning: there is always a chance that you find something that is not already ingame.

Yes, the CM99 and CM100 are the best fractals, hands down.  Nightmare is probably my favorite overall but Arkk is my favorite fight.
---
Seems they managed to forget this, as Twilight Oasis, Deepstone, and Siren's Reef are all absolutely terrible.  
---
It seems Anet's new strategy for 'challenging' content is just constant AoE Spam rather than intelligent or unique mechanics.  The final fight in Siren's isn't challenging at all, it's just stupid.
---
It's just not fun (certainly for me). The same 5 maps, expectations for every player to be instant experts and then berating your team for not having a plan when they only talk 5 seconds before the end of the game.
---
After getting smacked around far too many times (and the requirements to get the backpack at the time) I just thought 'why am I playing this if I'm not having fun?'. So I left it and felt much better.
---
Haven't played GW2 in a while.  What armor even is that?
---
Give us a chance to speak with our people on our language, ArenaNet. Is it harder than include and support chinese and korean languages, really?
---
That's another one that needs to change.
---
Instead having a set of slots per character, gathering tools should go in their own gathering panel along a gathering rework including gathering masteries and new methods and minigames to gather like 'hunting grounds' where you can set traps you can check weekly for materials and fishing rods in a new "Tools" category of novelties that you can use in bodies of water to start the fishing minigame, so fishing isn't an AFK activity and you can attempt to fish anywhere, without them having to set fishing that limited where you can fish and instead have entire areas where you can pop the fishing rood novelty and play the fishing minigame, allowing for secret and 'weird' fishing spots like a well, lava or clouds in the air.
---
Then convert the permanent tools into an account upgrade, and make glyphs account unlocks too. The first time you buy an unlimited tool, it'll unlock the skin, the infinite gathering and the glyhp. Buy a different one of the same type, and the price will be discounted for the infinite gathering, and you'd only pay for the skin, and also the glyph if you don't have it already.  
---
If you don't have permanent tools, you can still keep separate tools per character in the slots in the gathering panel. The account unlimited tool upgrade will simply allow you to gather when the slot is empty.   
---
Then the skins would be selected individually by each character in the wardrobe panel, and the glyphs individually by each character in the gathering panel. Players will still have to buy 3 of a glyph to put them in all 3 tools, tho. As they will be unlockable 3 times before they can't be unlocked again. Glyphs, like minis, will no longer be account-bound
---
The vendors that sell gathering tools will not be changed. When a tool with its own power is equipped, it will simply override the selected glyph until the powered tool runs out or a tool with no powers is put in the slot instead.
---
Also, create a way to store different appearances and customization per characters. Like the build loadout slots, but for visuals. Give 2 slots for free, allow earning another one with a method of your choice (complete personal story, earn in WvW or earn in PvP), and have a few cheap free ones on release plus a sale for an account-wide option. 
---
This way most people won't just buy 3 tools, 3 account-wide slots, and be done with it, but have more reasons to keep buying more and more gathering skins as they are released to keep multiple styles and appearances in multiple characters.

This is why I get frustrated when 1 or 2 of your team just straight up give up and afk when the score gets to like 95-210. Or sometimes even if we lose the intial mid rush. Sometimes it takes a minute or two for a team to gel.

Topology ! :D

+ orbs + karma + violetale magic + new currency (enough for daily currency so anoter karma and exp reward) + 10 greens are better then what you get in dungeons for the time you do the mission.  
---
  
---
And if we talk about mechanics dungeons bosses usually are only get them to corner and dps. They dont have flying snowballs (that teach players to stay close to get boons) they dont have that aoe you need to go on other side of the boss (teach them kill aoe mechanics for raids), they dont have that ice waves you need to jump or dodge over (good for teaching players to be ready for lets say Samorog) they dont have that one wave you cant dodge or jump over you need to use that save spot to jump and glide (teach players there sometimes are mechanics you cant dodge in raids)  
---
As you can see they put lots os shit there. Strike mission haters dont want to see that. Yes strike mission actually teach something to casuals, I am sure there will be one with break bars next.
---
Alright. I'm a druid main in raids (whoo) so feel free to ask questions of the class. As for your questions.  
---
1. Yes, absolutely. The main reason is because that build provides lots of buffs, healing and utilities, there are a *few* things you can do depending on the raid comp but for the most part yes. You can take Search and Rescue (and said trait, cut sun spirit or Tides) if you are experiencing a lot of downs, take lingering light instead of GOTL if you have 2 druids (more healing) Nature Spirit vs entangle or glyph etc. But that's all situational.   
---
2. Stat swap ascended gear and you can do LWS3 for easy trinkets! The exotic insignias are on the TP for ultra easy armor and weapon changes. Make sure to unslot any infusions first.  
---
3. No, infusions are a min/max type thing and not needed at all. If you want to go all out one of the golems (Infuz-u?) In fractal lobby sells +5 healing +9 agony infusions but it's like a 1% difference at best and is honestly not worth it unless you are going for records or low man attempts.
---
It might be tautology, but then again it might not be.
---
You can only copy&amp;paste Skills+Trait templates.
---
You can't copy&amp;paste gear templates.

Viable? Yes.

Optimal? Not even close.

Thank you for your insight ScapeZero :)

Hey all :) , so I used to play GW2 a year ago, but quit a short while later as I was overwhelmed by how different the game is compared to other mmorpg... now after playing games like Dragon Nest, FF14 and Blade &amp; Soul, I decide to try GW2 again, currently on NA server Crystal Desert as a Necromancer.
---
* About skill builds, traits and such, can we reset them anytime? I wouldn't want to simply customize using hero points only to realize I can't reset them later.
---
* Regarding gems, is real money the only way to buy gems for cosmetics in game?
---
* I know Halloween event is coming soon, and I'm wondering can a total newbie like me joins the event? Will it be hard?
---
Thanks in advance!
---
&gt;Stat-swapping a full legendary set takes so much time 
---
I also find it pretty expensive, especially when you take into account the cost of replacing runes etc. That said, I'm pretty poor.
---
Whatever gives you mystic clovers probably is what I’d vote for. Saves time/gold in the long run if you plan on making legendary items.
---
First of all thx for taking the time to answer all the questions and proposing me your help !
---
So if i understand correctly, i don't need the stats infusions first, i can earn raids with my ascended gear with AR infusions and even with Exotic gear :)
---
So nice to read this :D
---
i'll look into LWS3 trinklets :) thank you again !
---
Holy shit that last panel.
---
Yeah, I had the same problem with buying outfits and I don't want it to happen with skin mounts.

Get what exacly ? :D
---
I mixed some armor, dyed Black,the reapers hood is dark grey, and some parts are dark green (the nazguls in Shadow of War uses)
---
The mount is Raptor with halloween skin dyed black/dark green)
---
&gt; And about 99cm, yes, encounters themselves are good, but the whole structure of this fractal was very raid-like. Boss-event-boss-boss. At this point it there was the whole "fractal cms are the stepping stone to raids!' thing that went nowhere, but I still think that fractals should be different and have more emphasis on dealing with stuff other than strict boss encounters, have trash that you can kill safely/effectively/skip, have more varied puzzles, some mobility elements. In that regard SR actually has a pretty good structure (gasp! "SR" and "good" in a single line!) and 99cm is too basic.
---
I mean, boss-boss-boss is exactly what I want in a fractal.  The trash mobs in TO (the ones that aren't skipped completely) are tedious and annoying with their AoE and control spam, and the deepstone 'puzzles' are boring as hell.
---
What I'd actually like more of in Fractals is lore.  Stuff like Uncat and Thauma are interesting to me (assuming that both are the destruction of Rata Novus).  Or the Searing in Urban.
---
Skyscale so slow though... Griffon feels like it's got rocket boosters in comparison.
---
Thanks you for all your answers Keruli.
---
I've never seen those chests you can buy, i'll take a look at it !
---
For your last point, if all the guides are outdated, what's your advice to have an optimal gear with the proper stars your class needs ?
---
Thank you, yeah, this is what I will do. I won't buy a license that gives a random skin. I don't like playing on luck.
---
pick whatever gear you can cobble together, you have forge recipes which allow to swap stats for the price of ecto, some spirit shards, and an exotic inscription
---
All join the crossroads discord and try to get back into the LW for the currencies, thank you very much !
---
* stocking up triumphant hero armor for build tinkering;
---
* unlocking all hero weapon skins for triumphant hero exotic weapons with selectable stats;
---
* stocking up bloodstone (S3 map currency) for ascended jewellery with selectable stats that can be reset super cheap;
---
* stocking up boxes from S5 that will probably hold multiple currencies in the future (if the reward track is not bugged anymore) for easy access for said currencies in case they're worth something;
---
* get the Gift of Battle reward track to almost the end so you can finish it with 2 ticks in case you'll need it, but it doesn't take bank space this way.
---
The real way to make gold in WvW is to spend other currencies instead.
---
[](/kangelgrump)If anyone has to be worried it's the rabbit.
---
But can you send me what gear to run on PI DH no spotter please ?
---
My bot is plat just saying
---
Yes build and story pretty please
---
Ouh ok thats how thx

---
No offense but I just googled "gw2 big character" and first two results shown how to achieve that.
---
Downvotes, here I come!
---
I'm running through kessex hills myself right now with a new character and I was stumped by this one too. I knew it's an underwater cave somewhere but fuck it I couldn't find it anymore.
---
The Gear Optimizer seems a bit more beginner friendly than the dT one. Thank you for your dedication!
---
Good stuff! Thanks to all the people that put work into this update!
---
"Hey guys - I was super nice and all but this guy is being a dick. Did I do something wrong? :)".
---
:|
---
As long as you have stat insignia. Which means you'll have to farm trinkets and backpack
---
They changed them to last forever now.
---
Also the large tonic gets toggled off when entering water yet the minture one does not and makes me sad.
---
Thief runes, full berserker and 3 baguettes
---
You can also get the mist rings, trinkets, and amulet from the pristine fractal vendor if you are running fractals regularly. They are neat because you can select stats and later rest it if you change your build or want it on a different character.
---
I’ve had nightmares of the conversation from crafting so much in Rata Sum.
---
Nice.
---
Was thinking the same... even just some animated shorts in this kind of 2D style would be epic.
---
Just make them display visually only in-combat
---
Don't buy from them anymore you might not be so lucky next time you buy gems from them.
---
Yup so in the end i need to farm for those stats, ok, noted thank you !
---
I'll look at it, never seen them weird ... I need to FOCUS ! ahah
---
Yoooo thanks a tonne for this and especially the website guides. They are a blast to read and an invaluable source of info.
---
I've seen a good amount of replies to people who ask "how do I make gold" and usually these replies are something to the extent of "just play the game normally/do your daily tasks". I was hoping for more clarity on this because I'm trying to farm out the gold for the remaining crafting materials I need for ascended gear.
---
So outside of the 3 dailies for the spirit shard, 2 gold and some other small chest rewards and daily fractals, what are some of these "playing the game normally" ways people make gold? 
---
Note: I have watched many of the YT videos from a content creator well known for massive giveaways, most of the things this person suggests seem like a waste of time (though I might be wrong) or like they are long term goals, I was hoping for a different perspective.
---
can i go scholar and run 5 baguettes instead?
---
Holy cow there was no thieves or mesmers?! Haha
---
Heroic Edition includes some skins that can normally be bought in the gem store so it is legit.
---
Anyway there are prepaid cards that you can buy and use, or at least there used to be last time I checked. You could try and use one. 
---
Otherwise some banks give their customers the ability to make virtual credit cards (don't quote me on this though). In theory you can use them for online purchases. In practice I've never had any need for that so I can't say whether it works. Sorry.
---
I'm in the EU. Often my debit cards work online, as they have the 3 security digits. I have never used them with guild wars 2 though.
---
What I do is use my PayPal account with absolutely no problem. No credit card on PayPal either - just from my balance (a little money I make from online surveys every week) or directly from bank account.
---
When does Halloween start? Midnight West coast time or sometime tomorrow?

Lmao you confused me

Consumed for stealth, low cd.

I think Scrapper as a meme was added to the game before the Purity of Purpose trait
---
Oh I see what you are saying. 
---
Maybe. Not ringing a bell, but could be right. Either way, looks really badass. Love it.

I understood that reference
---
I had trouble finding it too, and found it just yesterday evening. At least I'm not the only one who struggels with these.

Commander: "Aurene you still hungry? Because it's time for dessert. And it's pumpking-flavoured with the scent of insanity"
---
Hey sorry to come up a month later but i was reading all the thread and if you don't mind give me some additional informations it would be great !
---
When you say you sell blue and green you mean unidentified gear right ?
---
And what do you mean by "if they're worth something", i have sometimes yellows that worth in instant sell 50 silver,  worth it or not ? When you  do sell, is it instant or do you put en price just below the lowest ?
---
Still looking to improve my use of the TP ...
---
Thank you \^\^
---
Nope, not intended. Just a trait that slipped through the gaps. I'll add it today. Thanks for the spot :)
---
Good question! The answer is, you're welcome. :)
---
Oh yeah it's not optimized at all for mobile because you shouldn't use it on mobile. We didn't do server side calculations because I'm not paying that bill. Heeelllll nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
Neat, thanks for this.
---
Only if the buildings are very tiny.
---
See: Upper area of DR
---
Can I ask what your PS4 controlled has to do with this? Can you use a PS4 controller with the game?
---
So the only unidentified gear worth opening is the yellows because they have a chance of actually being orange, but even if they’re not orange they might be worth 50+ silver instant sell, anything around 30+silver a piece is worth instant selling if you want to make quick money. All the other unidentified gear is better sold in large stacks, you can make a few gold that way. You get so much of it that eventually you hit a point where it makes more sense just to sell your stacks rather than break them down for mats and luck. I only break down for luck when I have small stacks from doing events and stuff. If I’m doing metas where you get more unidentified gear than you could possibly ever want, that’s when I sell them off for gold.
---
I always instant sell, I don’t list anything that isn’t immediately worth a profit because it might never sell, given the nature of GW2’s market system.
---
That would annoy people who like the graphic.
---
Ofcourse, and no it doesnt have to be tiny buildings. But the city would probably have to be big as queensdale for it to be in real scale.
---
Interesting factoid: Dragonhunter with perfects inscriptions is strictly better in fractals if you have the mist omnipotion.
---
This. I hate the grip, but love the mouse...
---
I'm actually thinking about boring a hole to where my ring finger lays for grip. I don't ever use g shift, my ring finger needs to grip something.
---
Very cool.
---
But I'm a little confused who it is supposed to be.
---
Redesign?
---
1. Skills, traits can be swapped out any time you're not in combat. You'll get enough hero points to max everything out, and then some extras too. 
---
2. You can trade gold to gems as well as purchase them. 
---
3. Halloween has stuff in the towns, and the halloween only areas scale your level to 80 so you can participate no matter your level. The Labyrinth during Halloween actually used to be a really good place to level up, I'd assume it still is.
---
Bouncy chests, so you have 3 chances if you get it done fast enough every day.
---
Alright, thanks for the information!
---
One more thing- just to clarify, I can do Halloween event on even level 1 character? I read somewhere about needing level 30?
---
Hi I'm a regular visitor of the benchmark page. Is there a chance you could do the LN setup (that is, no food, with all available buffs) on benchmarks numbers, so that it will be easy and cheap to practice rotations?

---
I have fought against really good ones, fact is the core shroud is badly designed &amp; at the severe end of the rock paper scissors end when facing a number of specs.
---
I was doing WvW for a while. Even got myself up to Rank 990. Problem is, I'm kind of on a dead server [SF] that just recently got abandoned, and I don't really want to pay for yet another transfer. Their premature announcement of alliances killed any desire of that for me over a year ago.
---
Excelente, felicitaciones por el diseño... quedo muy cool... y la expresion de los rostros mientras leen el mapa... genial
---
&gt; what's stopping you?
---
Likely the way it was coded back in GW1, and all the spaghetti from GW2 hanging over it now.
---
If I tried OCtember, I'd be into NotDoneYetvember. &gt;.&gt;  
---
I might have too many character slots.
---
There's a killswitch and build templates / arc often needs updates for new offsets when a patch hits.
---
Probably because spending time on fixing potential issues with the update coming tomorrow is a waste of time for something that needs to be disabled in two weeks anyway?
---
Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!
---
Motivation to play pretty much dead. Depending on what anet do about it when they release will basically determine if I will continue to have fun in this game or not, how did we even manage to get here?
---
&gt; everyone
---
How nice of you to speak for *everyone*.
---
Pretty standard for Asura tech, really.
---
So no build templates?
---
It would be nice if you could add [peppermint oil](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Peppermint_Oil) as a cheap option for builds needing concentration.
---
Everyone has to go without build templates for at least 2 weeks, and when they return, you have to pay for &gt;2 slots when they were previously unlimited and free.
---
So yes, *everyone*
---
There's a guide in the sidebar of the subreddit for returning players, should have a big spreadsheet that shows stuff that's been added depending on when you left. 
---
Major gameplay changes involve stuff like break bars, elite specs, mounts, masteries, which you should be able to read up on in the guide. 
---
If you want to hop right into HoT you can, if you want to see all the story you missed you might want to pick up living world season 2 before you do, which should also be covered in the guide.
---
So many warnings not to run on phone...
---
Too bad I don't have a throwaway to brick XD
---
you liking it doesn't mean you aren't getting fucked over
---
This is gonna be totally fun, first without templates at all and then with trash templates. Guess it's time to have a look at some games I always wanted to play, but never started.
---
You're not stupid, just dense.
---
Yes, I've seen them. I have a pile of screenshots, although I can't get to them now.
---
Well... we screamed for over 7 years now that we want build templates
---
MANY voices every said that they would pay money for it.
---
Here we are.  Anet gives us want we wanted.
---
&gt; Everyone has to go without build templates for at least 2 weeks
---
a lot of us have been going without them for 7 years.
---
Checking his post history, his second-most recent post had this to say:
---
"For the interaction code I've been told it'd be nice to have them disabled on the 15th (though it's up to my discretion on when I want to) so depending on how I feel or, more likely, if it breaks on the 15th will be rip templates functionality"
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dcbxtd/should_we_be_backing_up_our_arcdps_build_templates/f27fvql/
---
I trust my own judgement more than yours, sorry.
---
That's a documented appearance in just that one location.  It's meant to both show how the rifts are causing chaos in the Mists and other worlds, and also just to be silly.
---
I have foreseen this and created alts with different builds ready, because you cannot rely on anet templates
---
Did I say no one’s happy? No. I said everyone’s getting fucked over, which we are. Reading confirmed harder than raids.
---
They came from City of Gods. [T O K Y O](https://youtu.be/6OPW-RdzStA?t=123)
---
I see what you did there, taking a picture with a tower in the background
---
I don't think you are competent enough for claims like "everyone's fucked over". I'm not.
---
Thank you! As long as it doesn't get twisted
---
This... is Berk
---
Go read my other reply to see why, since you’re incapable of thinking for yourself
---
Just because you justified your statement it doesn't make it true in my eyes.
---
:p

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=nhxr9cYwGfQ
---
The truth isn’t your opinion. We’ve gone from free unlimited build templates to paying for &gt;2. It’s indisputable fact that we’re being fucked over.
---
&gt; stocking up boxes from S5 that will probably hold multiple currencies in the future
---
Careful. They could just update the track with new boxes instead.
---
Native templates are offering options I don't have with arc. I feel satisfied. Also, I'm not gonna pay a dime for them. On most professions 2-3 slots are enough and on my main I'll expand templates with gold (which I have no other thing to spend it on).
---
I lose literally nothing with native templates and gain everything. So, how about you rethink your opinions and stop acting arrogant thinking your personal feelings are universal facts.
---
And I'm pretty sure if anet didn't allow you to taste arc in the first place, they wouldn't have to read those complaints today about netive templates.
---
Lesson for the future - don't allow 3rd party tools ever again.
---
Wow i can't even understand a line in that document i'll need time but thx !
---
 "Gathering Notes, using them for volatile magic and buying shipments is also important. "
---
I'm sorry .. But can you develop that, i saw people talking about gathering nodes et volatile magic a lot, i know what they are but i don't understand the use of it in that case... In fact, i don't know how to make gold with it.
---
Does the google sheet answer that ? 
---
Thank you again for coming back on the post and taking the time to answer me :)
---
That's what people overdramatizing native templates situation do, however they don't call it like this directly. There are people I responden here, who claim it is universal fact I'm being cheated by anet templates. Like how arrogant can they be to tell me what to think or feel.
---
It sucks that it's come to this being turned into a freemium feature. I get that anet has to sustain themselves somehow, and they have the right to make this decision, but they're doing it at the expense of their core players. Despite the effort they may have put into build templates, it just feels like an easy cash grab / deflationary tactic. I guess it's always been that way with everything else in the game (inventory / bank / character slots / w/e).
---
I would easely buy 10 more Shared Inv slots  but NoOOoOooOoo...
---
FINALLY. I am so kittening sick of raiders using arcdps as a means to discriminate against players who have lives and, GASP, can't tryhard for hours on the golem. Get rid of the nasty tool used by the nasty part of the community.
---
no, we fucking wouldn't.
---
Imagine being sexist.
---
Yikes
---
Max height norn are around 9 feet tall, whereas 9 feet tall is meant to be "average." Average height norn in GW1 are as tall as max height norn in GW2. I'm not meaning to say the tonic gives them their "real" height, but alongside the fact that they made norn shorter after the beta events, I am skeptical they are as tall as GW1 norn.
---
Not everyone. People who never used ARC templates are not fucked over. They will get something extra and will not loose anything. ArenaNet's build templates are probably not going to satisfy you and most other users of ARC templates. But it would really help if you (and others) would stop making claims for the whole community. That would also stop people like BorisMeateater trying to make his point in a way that makes you angry.
---
So when they say your phone will die, they mean break or that it will drain your battery?
---
Because you literally are. If you cared about build templates, you previously had infinite for free and now you have 2 for free and a few more for money. You can't claim to care about build templates being added to the game and also not have downloaded arcdps templates at some point in the past. I never used arcdps templates either but I can still see that everyone is getting cut. "Fucked over" is kind of strong but everyone is certainly getting a functional downgrade. If you weren't using arcdps templates before, templates can't really matter to you and you're not the target audience anyways. For people who were using arcdps before, this feels like a veteran tax and even if you pay as much as you can it's still a downgrade.
---
I find myself trying to climb over things more so I find the skyscale more useful.
---
So the whole game is endgame then? lol
---
I didn't try, but the worst case would be the page crashing. It just means it's not very usable on mobile, so don't be scared off by the fun phrase :D
---
They could have sustained themselves with an expansion, but they've decided that low-effort story releases with microtransactions are the way of the future. With the boom of mobile gaming, who can blame them?
---
I don't want an equipment-build I want an equipment template. That's what I mean by it. If I use it on one character I want to be able to have a template on another character using the same item so that I can move it from character to character without recreating the build every single time I swap an item from one char to another.
---
ANet seems to like making April fools's pranks cannon:
---
* In GW1, corporal bane arrives every year to help him change history. You help him, he leaves, no one remembers him. He says he lost the rest of his team.  
---
 * He's from an alternate version of the future in which the war between charr and humans never ended, and so their weapons developed way past the current technology all the way to the levels of Earth in the 2010s.
---
* In GW2, we see the rest of his lost team, who got stranded on the way. Showing us that both traveling to alternate versions of Tyria and time travel are possible through the mists. 
---
* Also in GW2, SAB is a real thing.
---
* Old pranks were turned into toys too, like the aviator package and the bobblehead laboratory. I guess we could make the headcannon that the April Fool pranks where the result of some experiment gone wrong while researching those toys... Why haven't they done more of those anymore? I'm not saying it was because of China as always... [but I'm not saying it wasn't either](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/04/01/no-joke-april-fools-day-has-been-banned-in-china/).
---
Making the jokes canon also helps keeping them around even if some authoritarian government were to strongarm your parent company through a local publisher into forcing you to remove them, since they won't really be jokes anymore. Yay loopholes.
---
Lesson for the future: don't implement something that you cant support, especially if it exists already.
---
They cold, but to keep performance under reasonable limits in lower end machines, they would have to place the buildings in a way that covers as many as possible in any view, like dividing the city with large aqueducts or alternating tall and low buildings, so the parts behind the dividions can be culled, since GW1's and GW2's engine doesn't do progressive scaling as well as open world games like GTAIII and later, Just Cause, Saints Row and Prototype. 
---
GW2 will mostly hide what you are not seeing and replace things in the distance with flat impostors. They do have transitional modes, but nowhere as many. With max settings most you'll see a house or a boulder getting replaced by a lower res one after walking away for a while, some get replaced by an impostor if they are large enough and they are far enough, then no more changes.
---
You do know that with the new build template, it's easier to gear check people now
---
Any explanations why? Or just "won't work, becuase I say so"?
---
ironically those people probably wont even have a second set gear that they could put in there...
---
*build check, you don't have chatcodes for the gear because they are tied to the specific items if I understood correctly.
---
How about giving a useful answer instead of this?...
---
Portugal. We also have a service that creates virtual cards with specified amounts, that work as credit cards online - except you never give out any real card number and you limit the amount the seller can withdraw (among other advantages). 
---
Debit should work yeah. I just prefer PayPal so I've never tried it with gw2
---
You can always check if any bank near your area offers rechargeable prepaid credit cards or giftcard credit cards without having to create a bank account.
---
Like raids :)
---
&gt; I lose literally nothing with native templates and gain everything. So, how about you rethink your opinions and stop acting arrogant thinking your personal feelings are universal facts.
---
I lose nothing therefore everyone has to shut up.
---
Applause. I love this argument so much.
---
You can use hot join arenas for duels
---
Ah, okay, then I'll skip.  I need to save my tickets.  I can't play to diamond every week (some weeks I can barely log on) and I only have legendary armor for a few character and  I'm trying to get legendary armor for all of them so it will take the tickets.  
---
Too bad we don't have an easy source for selectable exotic weapons in the tracks.  (Exotic selectable armor doesn't need the tickets.)
---
If so I was informed wrong. Hmm I was kinda hoping to see the shit show from that as well. Oh well.
---
lol
---
I'd happily join if chat was all muted.  It's the nice thing about duels in WvW.
---
thats your personal problem if you refused to use an allowed solution
---
A "useful answer" to a guy looking how to continue hacking the game... LMAO funniest joke I hear all week.
---
So I don't rob people of discovering it by by themselves, I like to tell people to google "sump cave" or "siphon cave" when they ask about this one. 
---
Once they see what's that, they should get what to do right away.
---
Banned hack?
---
About the gear templates, my problem is that I have a lot of ascended/legendary gear that I share across multiple characters, taking advantage of the "account-bound" aspect of ascended+ items.
---
The problem with templates is that as soon as you want to move an item out of a character (to your bank), it removes it from all templates, rendering them pretty useless in my case.
---
its so ironically how people always complain about toxic elitists but in reality the toxic casual community is the worst part i've ever encountered in games
---
I never said people to stop complaining. Look at the context. I said people who whine should not talk as if their opinions were facts. Are you unhappy? Cool, talk about it. But don't act as if everyone was.
---
&gt; Can we talk about
---
We did all over reddit, for half the frontpage, for weeks since the announcement.
---
[Anet told him to.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/329262641040195585/633350463202525214/unknown.png)
---
&gt; it would be an amazing game.
---
...for you, not the average player who never visits any game's reddit.
---
arcdps templates were greenlighted by ArenaNet, they just said they won't help you if something goes wrong. I've never heard of anything bad happening with arcdps templates.
---
Regardless, you seriously act as if you are the only one that matters.
---
&gt; From your perspective, you may lose something. But why should I care? It's my experience that matters for me. 
---
Like wtf man, that's just a messed up way to see anything.

Is that builds for a single gamemode in PvE? Wow looks like for most classes it's already at or near the limit

Because RAIDS is the only game mode right?

"hacking the game" lmao, what a joke.

Sorry for expecting a reasonable conversation, won't happen again.

Goodbye everyone, I'm off to FFXIV for the foreseeable future.

Come on, everyone can see how they grasp at any straw from their massive strawmen to demonize people and then run them over by sheer numbers in that small echo chamber they created on some social media site.
---
Because with game update addresses in memory will change and if not updated properly in ARC, it may look and hook to the wrong part and cause unintended behaviour which will most likely make ARC not work or just crash the game.
---
&gt; Like wtf man, that's just a messed up way to see anything.

that's exactly the way template whiners see things - only from their perspective and what they lose, they accept no reason, no argument from people happy about native templates - case in point: you

If you read the context you would know why I joined the discussion. Thanks for personal innuendos, now you proved my point perfectly and I can't be more happy.

I'll miss my builds :(
---
&gt; putting out inferior build templates than arcdps has had
---
Fact is that the official templates are better in every point expect for the equipment limitation. You don't need to buy any build slots, because you can easily save them via txt file, you can hotswap builds/equip via hotkey, you can store equipment in your equipment slots. Oh, and the build changes won't bug around every 2nd time you switch your build (at least I hope that :P). All this are a way better solution than arc buildtemplates was. Only the (max) equipment gear slot limitation is a point arc templates were better (even though there weren't a equipment storage).
---
&gt; How come something that came standard and was an easy feature to use in Guild Wars 1 has to be expensive, complicated, and delayed by 7 years in Guild Wars 2?
---
Because GW2 is not GW1. In GW1 gear templates were limited to PvP only and were way easier to made, because you could create and delete PvP gear as much as you wanted. In PvE on the other hand weren't any gear templates at all.

Also GW2 has way less possible builds than GW1 had (for a good reason). Especially the whole time before HoT came out there were no need for healer and supporter classes. Even condition builds were very rare. It changed only with HoT release, especs, raids and the condition rework. But even then barely any class had more than 2 usefull builds in PvE. And later, when build templates became usefull, we got arc templates. At this point Anet weren't forced to bring official build templates as soon as possible, but could take their time to make it right.
---
yes but that’s because raids are terrible content and a waste of dev resources.
---
Lol, why are you downvoted
---
It's been another disappointing GW2 Summer for my treeboi.
---
Sure sure, whatever you say.
---
Like celestial melons.
---
Does average player need templates to begin with? I know people like to circlejerk how it's always the vocal minority that's unhappy about every change, but who's the actual target audience for templates? People that are a huge majority of the game, who use rare gear and roam around in open world doing achievements? I doubt it.
---
You just change to raid builds before raiding and back to non raid builds after. DONE!!!
---
All the Pr0 reidurs cry here all the time they just log to raid once a week so it shouldn't bother them either.
---
Cometh the internet weirdos and spam this sub Reddit with "My Cat Hateth These Templates!".- Just joking but I think we'll get more posts on this topic soon. :)
---
had something for this third thing...
---
I don't a f\*\*\* about the price just gime my 20+ templates. Thanks
---
they'll sooner rule out ArcDPS as against TOS than implement their own DPS meter.
---
False, you can only save the traits/build in a text file and NOT the gear.  So, for those of us that have legendary armor and over 6 builds on a character with leggy armor it completely devalues it.  Not to mention the fact that the gear template is combined with the gear storage thus making the gear storage pretty worthless for characters with legendary armor.  Fuck Anet
---
But Scrapper is good at
---
Which is why I said "a lot of people", not all.
---
why tomorrow i though anets build templates will come 1 week after patch
---
Tbh I think legendary armor is crafted by people who are into BiS gearing, prestige, something to do, or future proofing for meta changes.
---
PvP/WvW gear can be explained this way - it at least to me seems to be the more plausible answer
---
Yeah, that's my main point as well. I just want gear blueprints ;x;
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
It's OK guys, we talked about slavery being an issue for about 2 weeks let's just let it go now.  You don't get things to change by just talking about it for 5 minutes then remaining silent.  We need to keep up the pressure and keep talking about it only then, maybe, will Anet actually listen and do something about it.
---
Wait, it isn't? Damn... /s
---
Under 1g now.  Down down down they go!
---
Yeah, I'm right with you here. I just want gear blueprints. :(
---
&gt;Those, who don't will only have things improved with native templates.
---
If things roll out as they are, no. A max of 6 templates (not even per mode), 3 of which would have to be bought (per character), *and* they autosave whenever you switch a trait on your current loadout.
---
I was kinda looking forward to messing around with builds more (since I could switch back with a press of a button), but I think I'm just gonna skip out on it if things roll out as they've been announced.
---
This is what happens when you reduce supply faucet by 60% while increasing demand though achievements and legendaries that double the requirement of the said item.
---
oh god, this is a nightmare for me. I swap builds SO frequently that the next 2 weeks are going to be hell lol. i'm not looking forward to the anet implemented templates but this is just awful. i don't know about you guys, but i'm holding onto the old build template file until it breaks completely.
---
Because it would break down into thieves and mesmers using insta kill builds to nuke people from stealth.
---
Giving feedback to people who need it goes a long way towards improving runs. If a condi mirage is underperforming by more than 10k dps than what is considered "average" for Cairn (as an example) then there is something fundamentally wrong with the way they are playing the class, and it result in the fight going much slower, and that is one fight that gets progressively harder the longer it lasts due to all of the mechanics that get piled onto the group.
---
If you're such a carebear that you think you can get by autoattacking a boss in Nomad's gear and you think that's acceptable, then I'm honestly glad I don't play with people like you either. It's a two-way street, friendo.
---
Just think, though... now you have a whole other set of item slots of glittery garbage from the gem store!
---
... And you can buy EVEN MORE storage on the gem store to store more store-bought items from that store! It's never been so easy to spend so much on so little of value!
---
Did you miss the "not even per mode" part? Three slots for free **is what we have right now.**
---
Let me know if something gets announced to the contrary, with source.
---
Replace all world bosses and open world champions  with legendary subject 6. The moment boss shields up, is the moment bodies pile up.
---
My guess is that the RAM and/or cpu usage of the optimizer can be well beyond what your phone can handle, so the program (and maybe the phone) would crash.
---
I know about this and I wanted you to respond with exactly this argument because even this one is not valid.
---
Before templates I am bound to use currently available slots for pve/pvp/wvw builds. With native templates I can swap them to suit my playstyle - if I want all of them to be e.g. pve or pvp only builds. Not to mention I don't have gear slots now which I'm getting with new templates from Anet.
---
So, back to my original argument 
---
&gt; by definition an improvement, no matter further customisation or system limitations.
---
You're conceding my point that we're not actually getting any new free slots.
---
I think this depends on what you are looking to do. If you care about lore at all, do the personal story and then the Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire stories. If you don't care about a spoilers that you won't really have the context for to understand the significance of anyways...
---
# Get a glider and unlock masteries
---
Start Heart of Thorns and complete the chapter Prologue: Rally to Maguuma and you'll unlock the glider mastery track and masteries. Then you need to get enough XP to train up the first tier and 1 mastery point to spend on it.  This doesn't take long at all (maybe an hour).
---
# Get a mount
---
Then stop and switch over to Path of Fire. Complete the prologue and the first mission you will get will be to save a village. After that mission, you get the Raptor mount. No need to gain a level and mastery here. You can use it right away. This also takes maybe an hour.
---
# Finish the campaigns
---
Now that you have a glider, raptor, and the mastery system opened up, exploring the world and story will be exponentially easier and faster. So go back to the central Tyria personal story and play through chronologically.
---
I recommend doing story not just for the lore but also because it takes you all over the continent so you get a good idea of each zone along with a bunch of waypoints to fast travel around. This helps a LOT when you want to map around quickly later for world bosses or events. There are also unique rewards.
---
Finishing Heart of Thorns story will open up a quest that lets you create an Ascended weapon. Ascended tier gear is top tier. It shares the same stat distribution as Legendary. Legendary gear is ascended gear with unique skin effects and swappable stats. It is an expensive and lengthy process to get Ascended gear, so the free weapon after finishing story is really nice.
---
Finishing Path of Fire story will open up more mounts (manta ray, bunny, sand dog) and unlock access to the griffon flying mount.
---
# World Bosses
---
By now you will be fully decked out in exotic gear, have all your mounts, a bunch of masteries, and the world to teleport around in. You may have incidentally run into some world bosses while doing the campaigns. But there are many. Check out a timer like  [http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/events.php?serverKey=107&amp;langKey=en](http://guildwarstemple.com/dragontimer/events.php?serverKey=107&amp;langKey=en) to see when and where they are going to pop up and use the LFG in game (press Y and click magnifying glass icon) to find groups. These bosses are farmed for unique skins, gold, achievements and ascended gear.
---
# Fractals
---
Fractals are mini dungeons. They are harder than the normal PvE content and have unique boss encounters that can be a lot of fun. They are infinitely repeatable and scale in difficulty level 1-100 (you will start at 1). These are farmed for gold, unique skins and ascended materials. Every time you complete one you get some fractal specific currency that can be used to buy ascended rings and trinkets. Use LFG to find groups for daily fractal runs. Make sure you start with "t1" groups until you have some ascended rings/trinkets and by some agony infusions (don't worry you'll figure that out)
---
# sPvP
---
Click the pvp button at the top of the screen and choose "Enter" to go to the PvP zone (you can also queue from anywhere but you should go into the zone to explore merchants). If there is a league season going on, then do qualifiers and play that for PvP currency that can be used to unlock ascended gear (and progress slowly towards legendary) and unique skins. This is played for pretty much anything; you earn gold playing and can select a reward track that regularly rewards you with gold, gear or crafting materials. PvP uses specific build setup with almost everything unlocked for you to use regardless of whether or not you've unlocked it in PvE. Some things need to be unlocked with gold.
---
# End game
---
By this point you will understand pretty much everything. Open world, fractals, pvp, ascended gear. You'll naturally find the best farming locations (you'll know by all of the commanders and big event trains running around). Finish unlocking masteries, refining and gearing characters, preparing for raids, unlocking achievements, hunting rare stuff.

# Pro-tip
---
Do not ignore dynamic events and event chains. They are your bread and butter for earning XP and farming. They are indicated on your mini map by orange circles. They usually occur or begin near the hearts on the map. This is where most new players get lost because they are looking for traditional MMO quests (? or ! above NPC heads) and there really aren't any. Dynamic events are the quests. Look for them, do them, jump into the middle of ones in progress, listen to NPCs to see if a completed event is going to chain into another event.
---
I am sorry for people who are losing this. I'm one of the scrubs that won't install third-party software no matter how 'safe' it's deemed. So this does not affect me personally, but I know how many people rely on this, and how much Delta has done for the community. Glad he's keeping up the other portions. I hope you all have a better day soon. &lt;3
---
You got it. Give some time for the robust system to die so there's less of an outcry when that sweet, sweet profit rolls in later.
---
It's straight up IGM attitude which would make sense for a highschooler.
---
How unique
---
Im all about being unique XD
---
what skin is that?
---
ANet? Doing something about it?
---
Mountgate was addressed when Sterling made a video about it. ANet's reply was "1200 gems to choose your mount, and thank me for that".
---
Price was addressed because Twitter exploded over a weekend and several online tabloids screamed misogyny. ANet's reply was "fire Price and hope it dies down fast".
---
Banwave was addressed because the European Union placed itself between ANet and its customers. ANet's reaction was "take 2500 gems and fuck you, we only banned few people anyway".
---
The only way they'll address templates being an issue is if the thing blows out of proportion, like Mexico saying it will pay for the wall but only if ANet fixes template limits... And even then ANet will do the bare minimum to save face.
---
more gamemode more build
---
That's a very fair observation \^ ^
---
Rata suuum
---
Bye feliciaaaaa
---
If a cat didn't have a butt hole, then what would they stick in your face?!
---
Wait until level 80. Contains level 80 gear you can take with you into end game content and make life much easier. It's useless and wasteful to you at the moment.
---
If you remember the darker skin combos, please let me know. I'd love to mess around with that on my Norn.
---
They will exist forever in your heart.
---
It only reads so if you're dead set on reading it so.
---
I'm immensely glad we're getting an official transparent, pretty, supportable solution because it fits my needs perfectly:
---
* I have 20+ alts and on many, I have RP-thematised niche builds and gear that are not always useful for when I just want to play the latest map or to fill a different role in fractals; for that, two equipment + build slots are perfect, and all are free, and I still have a slot for PvP or WvW if I'd so desire.
---
* For my mains, I'll simply pay for a couple more slots with gold - just like I did for bags - and put all the leftover ascended stuff to better use, finally sorting out some outdated builds and hopefully getting back into fractals.
---
* I no longer raid because I got all the legendary gear carrots I desired, and I now have more interesting and time-consuming endeavors to pursue in real life. Life's been hard in some aspects and I'd rather enjoy the more relaxed parts of the game at random times when I'm not busy and I feel like it.
---
All I basically want is for people to acknowledge that different perspectives exist, and since GW2 as it is now favours those heavily, and thus their decision makes sense. But the "hardcorest" faction is so dead set on aggressively condemning everyone and everything that one is but forced to retaliate.
---
Hassan doesnt look like that.
---
yea, and I got the lucky bat in the back too, looking like another Fell Rider :D
---
If you so desparately needed build templates, why not use arc?
---
Sorry i click skills on cooldown, not randomly ;)
---
Also: context. Maybe you do need to focus on the game for content as easy as cm fractals, i'm sorry i don't have to :)
---
So you're saying its bad to try and help people who aren't doing well? How else would people see their metrics?
---
No lol both of the things you mentioned are thrash level. The engine is almost unusable and their hardwork is just reusing assets. I mean the art team would be able to make a nice loading screen but that's about it.
---
Yeah only people who are positive about the game are allowed here! Let's pretend like the game has no issues, and if you think it's not perfect be sure to keep that all to yourself and quit the game quietly!
---
But it only tracks 6 players at a time and you can't buy more than 6.
---
Basically the RAM usage is mental. If you do anything without infusions, it'll work fine though.
---
an in-house DPS meter would be contrary to what their core playerbase would want. Raiders are "a minority" after all, and our toxicity shouldn't be enabled by official tools. :)
---
It's the wording that matters!
---
Also NOONE forces you to play with snowflakes, just make your own groups... Not very hard to do.
---
I've done the same, just i made the male norn. :)
---
T3 human. Never seen in on a male character before ;)
---
The wording was as far from "helping people" as it could...
---
Also you do not help people that don't ask for help, thats a pretty rude thing to do.
---
 
---
&gt;With GW2 game engine and Anet's hard working
---
ehhhhhhhh... No....
---
They are. You can save gear configs and hotswap with a button (just imagine preboon as Harrier FB then *INSTANTLY* swap to DH with 2 keys!!!).
---
If you are too lazy to equip gears once per week or do not know your builds by heart i don't know what to say to you... Former tells me you are lazy beyond reason and second tells me you are not very good at the game.
---
How is that even a question, Cidd of course!
---
Yes. Give them feedback again so they can ignore it or do the opposite of what the community asked for.
---
&gt; What aspects of these keep you coming back?
---
CMs and associated bonus (and unique) rewards
---
&gt; What do you wish was different?
---
I hate bulletstorm mechanics, but that's just opinion. Also, it's time for fractal armor.
---
&gt; What could we have done better?
---
It's related to CMs as much as regular fractals. Every map should have CM. Also the changes you made to molten boss are obnoxious (together with deepstone as a whole). Skips and fights are what people want, not lame puzzles that stop action. Also - dialogues stopping progress are awful design and makes me miss skippable cutscenes from dungeons.
---
&gt; What did we do well?
---
Unique skins and titles related to challenges. Long term progression of fractal god title. Focus on bosses, less on trash mobs (and please no more Deepstone ever again). Skipping mobs puzzles / corridorrs are fine - invisible floor labirynth to slow the run is not. I love Siax for its ability to wipe the team if people not paying attention with aoes. Skorvald's mechanic to kick players of the arena is also great against slackers.
---
I love fractals, but the one thing I would like to see changed in them more than anything else would be for instabilities to be completely removed and for the old fractals to continue to be tweaked/improved and reworked to be engaging and challenging on their own. I'd rather each fractal be the best possible hand-crafted experience every time instead of the variation from instabilities which often don't add much in my opinion. The CMs already hold up well without them and annoying, but easy, instabilities like flux bomb and social awkwardness only detract from the experience (I'm also not a fan of having to gut my build in order to deal with no pain, no gain at random). Most of the time instabilities are pretty low impact and add little or nothing to the fractal experience and other times they have really unfair interactions. Sugar rush + npng + any damage multiplier is ridiculous in Siren's Reef and We bleed fire + two damage multipliers in the CMs can be painful for less experienced groups. In my opinion, consistent, well-thought out design is always better than random variation.
---
I wouldn't mind seeing some of the old instability mechanics (like last laugh) implemented as consistent mechanics for specific fractals where they fit in best (or even just to certain mobs/parts of a fractal) as long as each fractal could become a consistently good experience. The consistent, engaging mechanics of the CMs is what keeps me coming back, not the instabilities. We get plenty of variation already from the cycle of dailies and the addition of new fractals.
---
It's condi optimized...
---
This is pretty interesting behavior then.  If this is the case, that means everyone in the party has a 20s cooldown that starts  when the target is hit by them.  If the target has the boons already, it doesn't reapply them and puts their personal application on a 20s cooldown separate to everyone else's cooldowns.  This would give reason to some of the janky, seemingly random behavior of this instab. 
---
That's not how it's supposed to work at all, but it does explain the few edge cases where boons have been instantly reapplied outside of TO and SR.
---
&gt;What aspects of these keep you coming back?
---
**Boss rush**. Had these challenge modes been of Deepstone or Siren's Reef, or with all the RP that the regular version have, I don't see me running them. Our 2 current CMs are straight forward, 3 bosses, each with increasingly mechanical complexity, some short puzzles inbetween, no bullshit. It plays to GW2's biggest strength, which is its excellent combat. The challenge comes from the mechanics, not the pressure from ads or instagibs.
---
Also rewards. The extra ring salvage a day is really cool, alongside the additional encryptions and relics. The CMs *feel* very rewarding.
---
&gt;What do you wish was different?
---
&gt;What could we have done better?
---
Can't think of anything that I want changed with the current CMs, to be honest.
---
&gt;What did we do well?
---
The bosses are interesting mechanically. They require delegation of duties, but don't require insane coordination. Each boss has a gimmick that needs to be properly dealt with to win. Each boss has distinct phases with a *couple* new mechanics, without adding too many.
---
The Harbinger. I don't even care if there is no end game to him, just let him show up in new CMs to be intimidating.
---
I just meant in general for if you would have an off meta build in the future thats power. If you want to get a good condi tempest go to the elementalist channel in our public discord and ask people there, they are always able to help out
---
Nightmare and respectively it's CM are the shining gems of what 5-Man content should aim for.
---
Speak for yourself, child
---
* It rewards not only for high dps but also for proper management  of foes, including "trash" mobs. Event between MAMA and Siax can be done  exceptionally fast and smoth with utilization of various mechanics or  it can be a nightmare.
---
* You are not falling asleep in the middle of run.
---
* Mystic coins, Infusions.
---
* Nightmare could use more intense enviromental transition at the  end. For example, tower's walls falling down and players begin to see  something.. unsettling on the horizon. Its never enough to add a handful  of epichness. Yes, its more expensive to build.
---
* More Harbringer. Seeing someone on lv100 is soo amuzing (and envy inducing)
---
* Rare recipes as potential drops. More uses for solid ocean  fragments - its much cheaper to buy cubes from players than promote  fragments. It was balanced in the very begining, but not afterwards.
---
* **No meaningless, booring tasks. No bland enviroments.**
---
* Good balance of what players can do with some effort and what you asking them to do in order to achiev the final goal.
---
* Reasons to use unusual sigils/potions and consumables. Thanks for not nerfing them btw.
---
Both fractals were and still is very promising. I personally expected  to see Arkk eventually change how Dessa's Observatory works. (think of  custom maps in Path of Exile/Atlas of the Worlds). It must be outside of  realm of possbilities due to tech and money limitations, but.. well,  man can dream, right?
---
Thank you for reading.
---
SC retired, can't update site, can't even record PoVs, don't get me started on guides lmao
---
Found myself \[&amp;C1cAAAA=\]
---
Something I thoroughly enjoy about both CMs is their focus on positioning.  You are rewarded wel for competing the fractal &amp; you are punished pretty severely for being out of position at the wrong time.
---
Best parts to exemplify this are the bullet phase of 99 &amp; last burn phase for 100.  It’s all about standing in the exact right spots otherwise you eat a lot of damage that you don’t need to.
---
Yes.  Keep commenting negatively on threads to grind your axe.
---
Rose Gold on second channel looks good.
---
You gather Mistborne Notes, and consume thiem, you get volatile magic from that and you can use that to buy Tophy Shipments from any LS4 map [for example heres Ethall from Sandswept Isles](https://i.imgur.com/NV3K2Tc.jpg)
---
&gt;it could qualify as a 5 man raid
---
That's why to me personally 100CM is my favourite 5man content. Amazing by itself, and really good as a stepping stone to raids.
---
&gt;"won't work, becuase I say so"
---
haha, I wish it was down to whether I said so, 'cos then I'd just say "no" to all this and this wouldn't be happening. Anyway, what the other guys said.
---
Something tells me you haven’t pugged raids much... what the dude said, absolutely has happened MANY time over.... in fact, was just looking at a log, that INCLUDING AUTOS, was still maybe 30 skills total used. (Auto chain would count 3).
---
In case you didn't know, there are 3 types of legendary armors in the game right now: 1 from raids, 1 from pvp and 1 from WvW.
---
Here, I have some more exclamation marks for you: !!!!!!!!!!
---
Oh I see ... And if I understand correctly, then you get mats from them that you sell ?
---
And you are not able to tell that guy wasn't playing well without a dps meter? If so (in my oppinion) you are not experienced enough to command a squad.
---
Shattered has the most perfect reward system in the game.
---
You have short term rewards ala fractal drops but you also obtain the special CM currency which you can use to buy unique rewards or you can just sell it to vendors for extra gold. In addition to that, you have RNG drops as well like mystic coins, ascended mats, decorations, infusions, tonics, in addition to fractals’ regular drops.
---
The gameplay has been spoken for but the reward system is just so good that it bothers me that they don’t implement it everywhere else.
---
&gt;Noone cares for a &lt;1% optimization BS, infusions, and that other stuff that serve no practical purpose other than to appease peoples OCD.
---
You'd be surprised how many people actually cares...
---
chuckle, Even my PC crapped itself for about 30s with all the infusions turned on before it went and calculated everything.  Dont want to turn my phone into a hotplate.
---
Thanks for the tool, it more or less spit out close to what I expected but its nice to double check.
---
I will poke you after they change or make a new fractal with players feedback in mind, if they will ever do that (just like they did with class tuning few days ago)  ;)
---
What? Arcdps itself isn't being abandoned ie the damage meters, only the build templates.
---
Is this a question about the individual fractals or the entire game mode? I'd like to suggest getting rid of gear bound agony resistance. I am at level 100, why do I have to equip every build with 150 ar?
---
NCSoft isn't a big name in gaming? Not to mention the monetisation of GW2 is Anet's choice.
---
I mean, technically, yeah. That's a thing that's there.
---
Really though, I am just personally not familiar enough with it to give any sort of primer or know where to put it on a critical path for progression. I haven't entered WvW in probably around five years.
---
I want to mute the "War can't last forever" NPC in the human home instance.
---
You don't have it because you weren't logged in at all during it's window of release. Once a new episode is launched, the previous one becomes buy to play. So start saving up your gold and just exchange it for gems. You don't need a single real dollar.
---
"Just give it to us, even if I have to pay for it"
---
Look at their post history. That account spends so much time bitching at people in the most petulant way I'm starting to think it's some kind of performance art.
---
im uninstalling arc not the game
---
out of here with your constructive feedback guys
---
i am uninstalling arc, not the game
---
I still don't really know how best to farm for gold (I'm mostly sitting pretty at 7 gp right now from selling ecto) but once I have time for it/get the hang of it it'll probably be no problem
---
**What aspects of these keep you coming back?** / **What did we do well?**
---
They are challenging enough where even when you know exactly what to do its still fun to dodge and move at perfect timings to avoid incoming attacks and do individual mechanics. But its not too difficult to the point of being extremely punishing if you do occasional mistakes, which is nice for challenge but less nice for repeatable content.
---
I also like the 5-man aspect where there is overall a larger personal responsibility (compared to raids).
---
Decent rewards also help of course.
---
**What do you wish was different?** / **What could we have done better?**
---
My biggest issues are with Artsariiv and Siax, where I feel that it sometimes is just a bit too spammy.
---
Something else I would love is a bigger focus on learning boss animations for knowing when and what attacks are coming, rather than all these orange circles on the ground. Currently I don't think this is possible though because of all the particle effects on bosses, but doing something about that would make fights more dynamic than mostly dodging orange circles. One of my favorite raid bosses is Samarog simply because he is so large that there are almost no particle effects on him and you can very clearly see his animations to know what attacks are coming. There's no visual clutter there.
---
There has been -- four words in fact:
---
"Your Mad King says..."
---
The only reason you hate bulletstorm mechanics is because they're too inaccurate for you to tell where you touch them and where they fly past:
---
\- KC
---
\- dhuum
---
\- sabetha
---
\- fractal 99
---
etc.
---
well it is all situational, those are the perfect choice if that is what everyone around your target is wearing for some reason
---
Seriously, devs asking for feedback after 3 years ??? Getting worse and worse but fine he asked, first step of communication. 
---
Well replayability because of rewards, more challenging, no time wasted. By time wasted i think about the dialogues, the trash mobs packs, ...  
---
It's just fun boss with some mechs, 1 fast event to teach mechs of bosses.  
---
Random instabilities remove the fun sometimes but that's fine to not do them every day so.  
---
It should be the basis of end game content.
---
&gt; What aspects of these keep you coming back?  
---
The rewards to be fair  
---
&gt; What do you wish was different?  
---
Honestly they are pretty good and there isn't much to change.  
---
&gt; What could we have done better?  
---
   
---
Nightmare does everything near perfect, but the ball event in shattered observatory was a bit too finicky and strange.  
---
&gt; What did we do well?

I think a big plus these fractals have over the last two is that the arenas are big enough but manageable (Deepstone's was too large, latest one was too small) and that mechanics rallied upon the players themselves instead of the entire group unlike the elemental from deepstone or the cannonade. Also the breather phase in nightmare is amezing, both keeping pressure up and allowing people to still get their calm, plus the revive after it allows the entire fight to be both a lot harder and less punishing
---
i think they said ideally they would want tomorrow but they understand if Delta took longer
---
How do you get it? I am new to the game
---
Congrats
---
Hmmm. 1 year, 1 fractal. Logic seems sound.
---
I don't mind instabilities but there are some that are extremely stupid.
---
e.g.: 
---
you have encounters where you need to fit players at set positions to not die wipe or be annoyed vs social awkwardness.  
---
I really like it if they require you to play an encounter differently or use a different setup. It's nice to have some change. I also like it how there's a balancing of instabilities by giving you an advantage while giving the enemies one too.
---
this was a nice video and he's also got a nice narrator voice, very calm
---
Skippable cutscenes :)
---
Huh. Great save. Gotta give you that.
---
I think the issue is around what "it" ended up actually being. People aren't just bothered by the cash grab, they're also saying it's a subpar implementation of the feature. I think people would have more readily paid a single fee for an unlimited and well designed feature.
---
You can't please everyone of course, but that doesn't mean every solution is equally acceptable, either.
---
The rewards for the CMs are fantastic. You can get MCs, ectos, guild hall decorations, and a lot more. You also added a lot of very nice cosmetic rewards (infusions, skins, tonics, etc) that have been mostly absent since those two came out. The fights are fun, the music is excellent and there are no annoying trash mobs or time gated areas. Even the trash mob area in 99 allows you to split up to speed things up considerably. I'd like to see more fractals where skilled players can split up and do mechanics/events separately to speed things up (having fractals only be mini-bosses could get old pretty fast, so I don't mind having little interesting events/mechanics in between as long as they aren't time gated - see the deepstone pit as a prime example of an annoying area). 99 is one example and even the little labyrinth in the pirate one is OK, but thaumanova is really good at this. 99 and 100 are just really fun and challenging.
---
The environment of the final fight with Arkk is pretty epic (his dialogue, collapsing towers, space theme, huge machine in the background, etc). The 99 final fight is a bit more bland, so if I had a wish it would be slightly more stuff going on in the background during final fights. 
---
Less about 99 and 100 and more about fractals in general: some instabilities are just plain unfun. In particular, the new social awk has me yearning for the old one and the bleed fire desperately needs either tuning down of the damage, or a better tell so we can position ourselves to avoid it.
---
For me they work well. I really like them, they're a nice change of pace.
---
one time i forgot to fix my armor and my chest plate and pant wear both broke.   
---
Just so happens to be the only armor to be broken, huh?
---
u start by entering the dragonfall map and then u complete the living world story, when ur done u start the quest by speaking to gorrik att skyscale eyrie.
---
Nooooooooooooo, how can i play this shitty festival without my instant farm build swap...
---
Really nice! I love the detail and the shading is just MMMM so good.

---
Oh cool! I'll check that out
---
I really like the permanent agony there, so you cant just outheal them, you actually have to evade them
---
I wish you would just use the full word for achievement.
---
Even when I don't have time to play, I make sure to log in at least once a week so this doesn't happen.
---
And also so my guild doesn't kick me.
---
BOTTOM TEXT
---
Wait, are you telling me PUG raid trolls are so frequent you need a dps meter to weed them out, all while LFG is either raid sellers or nothing like 95% of the time?
---
So much for "the best community in an mmo"...
---
Also im not saying "not attacking" or "poor dps", im saying a guy that fakes kp and does trash dps is clearly noticeable due to failing every single mechanic (and if not failing mechanics... honestly... you should be able to carry it, since people nowadays are 4 manning bosses). Anyway, if its a troll, and they are so common, idk what to say.
---
Yep. In general having healing pressure is good, but a failsafe on mechanics like this preventing cheese really makes them more fun.
---
There are mechanics in CMs that don't exist outside CMs.
---
just remove NPCs talking for 30 sec before you can continue,remove trash mobz,remove retarded JP or running thru empty areas.
---
i also love the cms, but I still wish, if they at least could increase the boss hp by like 200% or even 300%, so people cant skip most of the mechanics just by having max dps.
---
No, the main reason it's being monetized is because it took dev time to work on this. Bag space is one of the excuses they have to monetize this, but the company needs to offset the cost of paying devs to develop this. This also is/was one of the top things people suggested when others asked "what would you rather they put on the gemstore instead of cosmetics?"
---
Oh, i was under the impression you can low man raids, clear them in greens, etc, and that the DPS check is like... 15k?
---
Theres also people literally selling raids where the buyer(s) does nothing.
---
And yet you speak like one person doing no dps but failing no mechanics will make you unable to kill the boss; if that's the case yeah, i stand by what i said, you shouldnt be commanding outside your guild/static.
---
At the end of the day the DPS meter truly breeds toxicity. You should be able to see your own and your own alone.
---
Also, your unsolicited advice won't make them play better instantly, so they need to leave anyway.
---
Thank you.
---
&gt; but I never thought they'd still be this popular.
---
there is nothing else to play, its either do CMs for 500th time, or quit the game
---
any new rewards/collections, and 3rd CM, so 2 could be on daily rotation
---
The only one of those that is "universally disliked" is SR, which is mainly because of the terrible boss (which I dislike for all the same reasons I listed above). The other 2 fractals are popular as far as I can tell.
---
This wouldn't even be an issue if Anet didn't drop support for dungeons and claimed fractals would be their successor. Ideally we would have raids for engaging bosses, dungeons for explorable instances, and fractals for scalable micro-instances with gear grinding. 
---
When anet tries to mash dungeons and raids into fractals instead of actually putting the content where it belongs, we run into issues like this.
---
Nightmare and SO aren't bad content, but they don't belong in fractals. But that's just a side effect of anet reinventing the wheel 1000 times like they always do. And now it's even worse with yet another instance type "strike missions"
---
Omg this was me the other night (I'm pretty sure the cold medicine made me do it).
---
Depends on what you are looking for. If you need Lucky clovers all those that can be made one time only give you 7. 
---
If gold then Crystal Dessert reward track. It will give you tons of crafting materials and rare items but it also give you trash items worth anything from 10 silver to 1.5 gold. This is what will give you the most gold back. You also get a end chest with exotic gear in it were you can pick any stat on it as you like. 
---
If you need currency from season due to some collection. Unlock the map reward track for the specific currency you need and pick that one.
---
If you need 20 slots bags then now or rather from tomorrow and a few weeks ahead you will have the halloween reward track. Each finish of this give you a free 20 slot bag.
---
It's the internet, it makes people less considerate, way less. Which is why you should not really pay attention to the shitty things people can say or do. It only affects one in a negative manner. Report and move on is my advice, always.
---
Save from what? did you literally think I was going to uninstall the game because of this?
---
Interesting! Why memory addresses change with every build? Can a program be programmed in a way they never change? Can ArcDPS be programmed smartly that it can find the changes?
---
Remember to use the official retailers, [&gt;&gt;list here&lt;&lt;](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/), to prevent any complications when buying the game. ArenaNet cannot help you with unauthorized sellers and using fraudulent keys can lead to account being suspended.
---
you can and they have considered that but there aren't always enough mesmers willing to run between points.
---
 **What aspects of these keep you coming back?** 
---
\- Nightmare and Shattered Observatory are fun to  play, because they feel a lot more challenging. I also love twilight oasis fractal, but that has no cm yet.
---
 **What do you wish was different?** 
---
\- for cm especially I would love to see more sources of agony. the normal  modes are fine as they are.
---
 **What could we have done better?** 
---
\- more unique rewards for every cm boss encounter; like weapons skins,  combat tonics &lt;3 , or whatever
---
 **What did we do well?** 
---
\- I really love ensolyss as a boss, his dialogues, his appearance, his mechanics. And I also love the challenge mode version of Mama, just because it feels like it is the hardest of all cm bosses. Also the reward systems of cms is great. i like how every boss rewards you sometimes with a few gold or even unique item
---
Wait... oh...OH... okay...
---
I’m saying, when there’s a bunch of other things that you have to pay attention to, a dps meter does give easy access to alerting you when there’s an issue. Low dps, or even bad boons... these things prompt you to look at that player to see why... are they stacked, are they doing mechs, why are they underperforming.
---
Without a meter, the possibility of seeing this is FAR lower. Not even if they are trolling but just being super lazy.
---
As for failing mechanics, that one is clearly visible... but if they never get a mech, or don’t get assigned one, you cannot use that as a prompt.
---
Now, is it fair for someone to be lazy, not do mechs, and get the reward that other people earned by carrying them? No. It’s not fair for someone to leach and get rewarded for it. Can it be completed, yes, but that’s not the spirit of it. 
---
As for your question that we “need” a dps meter to “weed them out”. Absolutely. The presence of a dps meter, and it KNOWN, means that people who intend on being lazy, know that someone could be watching... and one of two things happens.. either they fix it and try to be good (then we have no problems), or, they pray they’re not outted. If there was NO meter, then as long as they LOOK like they’re doing something, no one can claim it was them. 
---
The presence of the dps meter, or at least the possibility of one, is somewhat of a deterrent. Like a dummy camera in a store, doesn’t always work, but having it there stops more than you would think.
---
Decorations aren't features, has anything at all been added to the guild halls since release that aren't decorations? New structures, new levels, new vendors, new anything
---
You: * Unlocks Skyscale *
---
Game: Get That F**ing Rift Mastery!!!
---
&gt;LWS3 and 4 come IN THEIR ENTIRETY with HoT and PoF
---
They don't. Not even partially. You must have logged in during their free periods, thus unlocking them even if you didn't own the expansions allowing you to play them.
---
Every Living World episode release since Season 2 began had a "free period". For Season 2, this was two weeks. For Seasons 3 and 4, it was "until the next release" (thus being between 2 and 4 months). Presumably Icebrood Saga will function the same as Seasons 3 and 4.
---
Every Living World Season (sans Season 1) is to be purchased independently from the expansions if you didn't log in during that free period. They cost 200 gems from the story journal, or you can purchase a "season pass" bundle from the gemstore at a 10% discount rate (it also discounts the episodes you own already so no double purchases). If you own any episodes without purchasing, then you logged in during the free period and nothing more.
---
Which could have been for any number of reasons. Don't be so quick to jump to conclusions.
---
A person doing bare minimum dps would likely be failing mechanics left and right as well. Not always obvious that they do, and it will more often than not be covered by the healer since not every mechanical failure is a one-shot. Not to mention, there's likely going to be at least three dps players not pulling their weight, if not more.
---
It's very clear that you've never raided in a pug if you're speaking in hypotheticals such as this. 3-4 underperforming dps is standard on NA pugs. lmao
---
ALSO without dps meters, monitoring boon uptime percentages across 10 players is nigh impossible. So you can't really tell if they're underperforming because they're not doing even a half-proper dps rotation or because quickness is low. You'd then compare it to other players - if other players have fine quickness uptime and it's not self-generated, then they're not positioned properly. That's harder to determine with Quickbrand in particular due to their mantra AoE being a frontal cone.
---
There's a lot of nuanced information that dps meters and logs can provide that can be easily missed if you're just doing the run without evaluating performance whatsoever.
---

I agree, it's stupid

Hi, I fall under semi-casual or semi hc and I don't hate hardcore players! They're the ones that figure out how to play the game in different ways.
---
Also, mesmer alone has more than 6 builds for raiding.
---
Telling people to quit does not aid to this discussion.
---
Cite some sources for Devs hating on hardcore players.

---
Thanks!
---
Yeah, it’s...honestly pretty bad in NA pugs. EU pugs are more toxic with their KP requirements, but their pugs are actually worth a damn. 
---
Btw, NA pugs DO double healer...because of this... and sometimes, it’s not enough and they even suggest triple healer... (SH for the longest time was aura/scourge and two druids... same for dhuum)
---
I'm not sure if mirage cloak applies to clones in the process of shattering (or if they can even be hurt at all, now I'm curious because I don't think I've ever seen my clones get stunned/killed while shattering), but if they are, making clones in the process of shattering ineligible for mirage cloak, or if they're invulnerable during shattering, giving them xx% damage resist instead might help.  Wouldn't be perfect but would give people a little more time to stun/kill the clones before they shatter.
---
I would highly recommend trying out mirage yourself though, it's what my Chrono became after anet removed Signet of Inspiration's boonshare\* and it's a lot of fun, hyper-mobile (probably not as much as Daredevil, which has been on my list of things to try), and has a fucking doorbell as one of the skill sfx (can't remember which one though).  Additionally it'd probably give you a better idea of whether or not it really needs a nerf, or if it just needs to be better understood.
---
\*This was one of anet's poor balance choices that was spurred on by a community who didn't understand, or want to understand, how Chrono worked.  The result was that an entire play style which revolved around slapping boons on allies by interacting with summons (lesser signet of inspiration was the first to go, which made boons on your phantasms get transferred to you when they expired, leading to phantasms being a boon multiplier and making the whole rotation feel very fluid) over hitting things with sticks, *the one which got me hooked on this game*, was killed off.  Chrono was a bit overpowered, anything that can give 100% uptime on nearly every boon in the game to their squad would be, however it was extremely disappointing that Chrono lost its ability to be a true support in the process, and up until about a month ago I only logged in to get lw updates because of it.
---
Thanks for being more reasonable.
---
This has already been said and debunked in a previous thread.
---
The best solution would be for gear storage to work like a bank tab between all characters. Since for whatever reason gear templates resets when you take out gear out of the gear storage.
---
Yeah I'm happy I waited for Requiem haha
---
being super tired =.=
---
pros : they're fun, they have their own mechanics, they are centered around their main fights with few annoying parts of trash mobs (opposite of what was done to rework fusion duo for example), they even have their own rewards
---
con : they are the keystone of "raidifying" fractals, making them harder to learn, making it mandatory to run with a full experienced group and not possible to just randomly jump in to have fun like it used to be possible to dungeons (rip) or early fractals. I know t4 is not mandatory but let's face it nobody will want to run the lower levels once they know the place, given the reward structure. Those 2 fractals are not the only "raidifying" thing (all reworks also count), but they're the central part in that direction you took. I know there is "challenge", they're not as hard as raids, and so on. But it drove me away long ago. Not that I can't clear them (they're rly not a problem for me), but when I want to raid I join my static group or look LFG to carefully make a good team and then focus on good playing and beat the bosses. Fractals would be perfect content for the opposite : just coming back from work, joining a random team of 5 people and playing through without worrying about anything but having fun. It's just not possible anymore. I'll have to join an actually good team (best for this, join cm+t4), be meta (or close, taking a character I didn't already learn for raids is not an option), probably prove that I have experience (kps), maybe wait for quite a long time in lfg (alone or in a team that needs a specific member to be meta and ensure a smooth run), and then either have a good/fun/satisfying run or see it become extra annoying (with risk to disband and go back to lfg time waste), no in-between in my experience. tldr : I don't like how fractals are now closer to 5man raids than casual group content especially since their is not such content anymore (strike mission might become that content by the looks of the first one, but ironically they're supposed to be the stepping stone for raids  ... so for now I feel like fractals and strikes have their roles switched)
---
But people who want native templates could have just downloaded arc templates. You don't gain anything new from native templates you couldn't have had before, while vets with lots of arcdps templates are losing functionality and having to pay. I've never used arcdps templates because it hasn't been important enough to me to bother setting it up, but I can see that people with lots and lots of builds are getting thrown under the bus.
---
This game has the best wiki. Thank you for all your hard work.
---
I've tried it. It doesn't do anything except stand there like a HP sponge with stab and barrier. Great if you want to be lazy and auto-attack your way through meta events or if you're new to level 80 content, but for anyone looking for something a little bit more gameplay wise and wants to actually contribute to what's going on around you, avoid it.
---
Its like 18 hours left?
---
I like how you're pretending that NCSoft is as big as SquareEnix, and has as much clout, and resources.
---
there are going to be chat codes for builds, but not gear loadouts, so some checking is going to be possible.
---
yeah agree  simply meant that I don't think most pwople craft ledgie armor for the skin...weapons are a different matter.
---
I just want to say that I think you go too far with 100CM aoe spam. I dont find it fun, more like anoying, I feel tired after it. 99CM was way better. Make bosses more clean, more simple visualy, harder dont mean more things flying everywhere.
---
Here, you may have missed this post:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dhspu0/arcdps_build_templates_to_be_disabled_tomorrow/f3q8w8h/
---
Someone named InariKamihara posted:
---
"For the interaction code I've been told it'd be nice to have them disabled on the 15th (though it's up to my discretion on when I want to) so depending on how I feel or, more likely, if it breaks on the 15th will be rip templates functionality" 
---
It kind of shows that anet doesn't want to make certain that they're unusable, as they said it was up to him.
---
Strong punishing attacks, yet easy to see/telegraph so we can evade them. This is the main difference between MAMA or Ensolyss VS Amala. Amala is a fight I don't like because there is so much fucking going on (specially at portals phase) that I can't even see where am I so when I die it gets frustration "what did it even hit me?" style. On Mama and Ensolyss you can play and you are only punished because you didn't dodge that obvious attack or something. You actually can understand what hits you and that's somehow engaging.  
---
Add wyverns to shattered observatory.
---
&gt; What could we have done better? 
---
I feel the "move the bomb to those 4 corner pylons" on Arkk fight is really frustrating with pugs, because a player can (by accident or purposely) corrupt the experience of other players and it happens often.
---
Mama and ensolyss challenges are fun and engaging. It's the correct way of creating a challenge, NOT based on a timer or a DPS check. I know lot of people like those but it's a lot more engaging when there is no time pressure. Sioxx I didn't like it because of that.
---
I believe they mentioned the “some of us have been waiting 7 years” comment. Which, if you refused to use an option, that’s on you. Templates were a thing, they were allowed as a stopgap by Anet, and you refused them... that means you don’t really have much in the discussion of “fucking over the players”. 
---
Impo, especially since trait/skill templates could be free and stored locally instead of on anet’s server.
---
Well how about we wait till the Labyrinth is actually released first so people can test out the builds
---
should still be either shortbow thief or flamethrower engi.
---
So from what I can tell, the benchmarks haven't changed much since the patch? I still see the same runes etc. is this correct?
---
Legendary gear can be in several build loadouts at the same time with different stats. They will not lose usability for the same character, only for multiple characters, since it'll be a pain to move them between characters with all the unequipping and requipping. 
---
Since all legendary gear is already account-wide and accessible to all characters, then the hassle of constantly moving and transmuting legendary between characters is the only thing that needs compensation, and cost for legendary replicas should be based on that.  
---
So the only way I can see replicas of legendary items working is making it a feature for alts: 
---
* Replicas will say "Replica" in the item description instead "Legendary", to make sure it's distinct. They may also have a different item color, like Cyan.  
---
* They require you to first bind the original to the account, obviously. So for tradable ones no one would be able to craft, replicate, keep the replica and then sell original. 
---
* The same character can't use a legendary twice in the same set (legendary &amp; replica, or 2 replicas in offhand and main hand) unless the legendary has been bound twice (i.e. Twice Told Legend).  
---
 * Until a legendary is bound twice or more, the original and its replicas will be considered 'unique equipped'.
---
 * You would still be able to a different gen legendary and apply the same skin to both, tho. 
---
* Replicas would obviously not work for achievements. They will not not count towards Legendary Collector, Legendary Armor, Twice Told legend or anything else. 
---
* It should still have a decent cost. At least using ascended gear as a base. Like a mystic forge recipe:   
---
 * 1 Item available from Hobbs for a reasonable cost after binding the legendary, like "Soul of Bolt" after binding Bolt. 
---
 * 1 Piece of ascended gear of the same type, like an Ascended sword to replicateBolt. 
---
 * 2 other items with a cost adjusted to be reasonable for the feature, not so low it can be done by just anyone in one evening for all characters in their account, but not so high it'll be impossible to convert ascended gear for all equipped characters into legendary. For example, something that costs 20 spirit shards, an a stack of 20 obsidian shards.
---
**TL;DR:**  legendary replicas should only be a QoL feature so you can use your legendary gear in all of your characters without having to constantly put them in the bank all the time instead having it all stuck in one alt of having to make full legendary sets of all characters, and while keeping different skins on each of them, and they should still require to gear characters ascended to use the replicas. 
---
For fashion there should be separate appearance slots, without having to use build slots for that.

for what it's worth, the build templates addon still works right now. i'd hold onto it for a bit and see if it breaks completely come tomorrow. if it does then yeah, time to let it go

Hi, I’m a ex-semi-casual, newly casual (mainly because Anet has been making more and more choices that push me further away from a game I love), and I find more hate from the Toxic Casual side than any elitist I’ve met. 
---
Also, your comment reads like &gt;1% of players raid.. which isn’t true.. it’s probably closer to 20%.
---
I answered in that thread and am too lazy to repeat it here  
---
My point was that in general cms are muc hbetter designed than fractal that followed them, but I lack any social recognition for doing those; in Classic when you have BiS gear everyone can see it, we do not have any items that are both easily recognizable and only, let's say, top 10% has access to.   
---
Adding things like that would serve as a walking advert, skilled veterans would walk around with those, and new players would get interested.   
---
tldr, I'd like to see more account bound gear that looks cool and is locked behind semi-hardcore (like 20min/cm map) gate so that it's not common
---
Hello, someone with 28 characters here..... nearly all my characters play &gt;3 builds. My mains play closer to 15+.... templates from Anet are still shitty.
---
Same as last year - nothing changed. 
---
So engi with flamer and thief with shirtbow, no trinkets equipped, pls don't open doors unless the commander says so.
---
Chrono has:
---
Power boon (no variations)
---
Condition Boon (2 variations)
---
Power (no variations)
---
Condition (no variations)
---
And theres condi mirage, with no variations either.
---
Snowcrows lists 6 gear loadouts (guardian has more lol).
---
Maybe (just maybe) consider that swapping a weaponset or a few accessories is done with 2-4 clicks and doesn't deserve a build slot.
---
Source for devs hating HC? No HC content
---
Souce for casuals hating HC? reddit, the game.
---
shortbow thief as someone mentioned is pretty low effort. personally i enjoy necro w/ staff + wells. looots of aoe potential
---
Can someone explain to me, a newbie to the game, what this means? What are build templates, what is Delta, what is arcdps, and what is Anet adding as a feature to the game in replacement?
---

The SC viability competition currently does not happen anymore due to limited support meaning limited amount of gems that can be handed out per competition = less incentive to participate or host the competition. With the decline of the raiding scene, it'd be nice to participate in a casual competition like this once in a while :)
---
I think another thing that is great about the 2 CM's is that the mechanics that have to be dodged are pretty much all clearly visible and are not hidden underneath a ton of other special effects.
---
Fights that are pretty to look at are good for a few times, fights that play out nicely because it is always your fault if you don't dodge somthing that was clearly visible have a lot more replayability imo.
---
I feel like a lot of the newer fights have way more unnecessary visual clutter.
---
Yes. (Depends on build)
---
Thanks for the help
---
Totally will be seeing “Ping your build on join”. Which, imo is just a step off of “ping your build AND gear on join, also KP”. I mean, at this point, just add the gear check. Other mmo’s have them and nothing toxic I’ve seen from them yet. In fact, super helpful to know if my tank or healer is undergeared, so I can correct my playstyle to match.
---
1. Farm Dragonfall
---
2. Farm Silverwastes
---
Also, you can do Fractals because T1s are easy, though it's not even close to your best option, but it's more fun than mindless farming, at least in my opinion
---
P.S.: Dragonfall also gives Volatile Magic, which you can use to buy Trophy Shipments (gives T5 and T6 materials). The gold to buy it you can get by salvaging and/or selling the unidentified gear that drops on the map
---
As of now, it goes like this:
---
* If the enemies will come to you (e.g: Cursed Shore temple events), then Engineer is the best. 
---
 * Put a flame turret and a thumper turret on 2 of the spots where incoming enemies stop being invulnerable, and spam away with flamethrower all over the place. 
---
 * Also drop Napalm and mortar fields so other players occasionaly tag more enemies for you with combos. 
---
* If you will be constantly on the move in a zerg, bring a shortbow daredevil. 
---
 * Drop choking gas regularly hile spamming 1. You will tag a lot with bouncing sot, and everyone else will combo with your choking gas and also add some extra tags for you. 
---
 * Impacting Disruption will add some nice extra damage against veterans and higher HP enemies. Everything else will probably a splode before the pulmonary impact kicks in. 
---
Conditions are to slow at tagging anything, so it's better to go full damage and bring Berserker gear. This will make tagging a pain for anyone else and reduce the overall loot everyone gets, but nobody else is going to bring soldier gear or remove their trinkets, so it's everyone's fault, not yours alone.
---
you are not looking to deal the most amount of damage to farm the event, you just need to hit a lot of mobs as fast as possible
---
Firebrand book 1 skill 1. Use the trait to recharge justice on kill. Its the closest to loot stick we got left.

The majority also plays, wvw, pvp, only logs in to get daily, and “rps/erps in towns”.... you have to have some sight... considering context of who actually would be using templates, yeah, the majority of them is being screwed.... that includes wvw and raiders.
---
Wvw, because they won’t be able to weapon swap on the fly if they stored a weapon in a build.... huge hassle at least.... raiders because they’re going from a free unlimited to a “2/3 pay for more, max 6/6”.
---
As for the 2 week “dry spell”... the amount of people who do use arc templates, are all being screwed.
---
This is also absent of the fact that you’re not using the templates, but claiming that you’ve been “waiting for 7 years”. Iirc templates have been a thing for 3 years? So, if it was an issue, there’s been a fix for you.
---
Without this, you don’t have much weight on the conversation. You’ve got about as much stake as a pvper talking about raids, while never having done it.
---
No need for it http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PWABc+t/lRweYIsKmJO8WXPVA-zRRYLBhZG9cnjR9KIUK4YaSxaE-e
---
Congrats you aoe burn around your target when you tag stuff, you aoe burn around them when nearby people tag stuff
---
Looks like she has a third eye and I legit wish Sylvari had a couple faces with a third eye now. Beautiful art.
---
You seem to have misinterpreted that as “no weight”, instead of written as “much weight”. The arguments I see all the time is “casual people didn’t use templates before, they probably would barely use these”... well, those people are not a factor of the issue. 
---
I see a lot of similarities to the “BLM vs ALM” disagreement.... yes, all players have a say... but since you’re not part of those who are having the issue, you don’t have much weight.
---
Those who had templates, and need the templates, are being screwed over... and yeah, it’s pretty much all of them....
---
The ammount of maximum templates is the real issue .
---
Mace/mace is stronger for CCs, but hammer's not too far behind. Tremor double-hitting is what makes the difference.
---
I'm stupid lol. I havent visited LN website till now and I've just  realized that they have their own benchmark page (with LN settings).
---
Your....grammar here makes this statement confusing... you need a bit of punctuation. 
---
I can read this sentence a few ways:
---
&gt;I always describe things -I decide on my own- as, “I’ve been told”, that I need to do something.
---
&gt;I always describe things I decide on my own, as, “I’ve been told” that I need to do something.
---
&gt;I always describe things, I decide on my own as; “I’ve been told” that I *need* to do something.
---
I’m genuinely curious what was the intent of that sentence.
---
You only mentioned two out of three gem options.
---
Don't hold your breath tbh.
---
Meanwhile, I quit FFXIV because there hasn't been anything new and overly engaging (the engaging part is subjective and my own opinion, of course) since they added a single raid and a gold farming dungeon in [July](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/special/patchnote_log/) (Patch 5.05 in the link.) Just repeated holidays.
---
In the past, I've breezed through their new story content in an hour or two as well, so I'm not sure why people complain about getting that amount in GW2. Admittedly, it often is accompanied by a dungeon in FFXIV as well, so there is that. 
---
For me, though, it really doesn't feel like it's worth paying a sub for it when I run out of things to do in a week after each update. "Playing GW2 once a week for my weekly raid clears" is exactly how I feel about FFXIV at this point. That was all I was doing, and it was growing boring fast. I keep a couple classes geared through raids, and then I just end up farming the same content on repeat for... Some reason. 
---
Same thing I do in GW2, but in GW2 I don't have to pay for it.
---
couldn't agree with this more. This also sheds some light on an issue. I love deep stone fractal, *because* it's more like a dungeon. However, it's also true that that makes it more of a pain in the ass for fractal dailies. I feel like there is a place for both kinds of content, and that would be the difference between a fractal and a dungeon (or a low man raid).
---
&gt; but I never thought they'd still be this popular.  
---
and i thought they have all kinds of statistics where they can see what players do? hey, i did good, replayable content, and players still do it. *pikachuface*
---
Oh I definitely agree with you there.
---
Textual tone needs clarifying marks. Either a /s, or some *italics*, maybe even some CAPS. Especially if you’re implying something. Otherwise it’s to be read as a statement.... which isn’t really a joke.
---
The lower the DPS, the better.
---
The snow crows servers will probably be overloaded for the next 2 weeks, as many players will need to change their build frequently and don't know the exact traits. 
---
Some access statistics to this website would be cool.
---
3-5 business days seems to be about the norm at the moment. Just hang in there :)
---
The issue is that these are not saved templates, these are extra loadouts that change any time you update gear or skills in them. That's not what I want. Not to mention the way they set it up so you have 2 gear slots only per character for 2 (3 if you count weapons in PvP) modes and many, many different builds.... sure you can buy 4 more slots *per character* but even then every profession has more build variants than that in just PvE. I'm happy putting money into the game for QoL but this isn't at all what I want and it's at a price (at least the 400-600 they suggested) that's way too high when it's this needed.
---
It's not coz tomorrow I will throw money on an other game and not in the gem store.
---
*pats you on the head*  Shhhh.  The adults are talking.
---
The fuck do you think we're testing?
---
The point is to have a low damage build that spams AOE.
---
A whole 10 people.
---
Ill get right on it after my berliner bol holo bench
---
I actually like condi soulbeast with the raven equipped. The skill that pulls in the mobs is cool and drop traps and torch 5 and win
---
sometimes you need to punish someone on your arts team. Send em to design and implement anuses to the mini pets!
---
Tag later
---
Try actually having a proper sentence structure, and be less condescending next time.
---
The point you were attempting to make is now void.
---
Regardless, we’re discussing two points, that don’t counteract with one another.
---
One, is Delta’s statement. He was told the 15th would be nice time to stop it. So he’s doing then.
---
The other, is the reasoning behind why Anet wants it stopped. Which is, if a free version is out there, no one would buy their extra slots.
---
“The other” is the comment you replied to using “one”. Which, is moot.... since Inari was talking about WHY Anet wants it stopped, not what delta said.
---
Try reading comprehension, I heard they teach it young... it’s possible you missed it. Now, go back to the child’s table *the adults are talking*.
---
So tomorrow **don't download** the latest version of arc template as it should be able to work for an other 2 weeks. Let's hope that ANET won't break it before their thing goes out.
---
Man no offense but if i have to believe either SC or you, i chose SC.
---
Also seriously? Are you listíng "no spotter" as a whole different build?
---
Offtank another whole bulld? Hahahahaaaaaa... Cmon...
---
PS: doesnt snowcrows have the meta builds? Why are you playing NON META (Aka worse) builds?
---
Well, the thing with that is that we ask people to do benches, back then people didnt ask for logs and just assumed it was legit (because I wouldnt expect guildmates to lie about this tbh). If a bench was done with writs it would go on the website without us knowing it used writs. SC was never intentionally trying to pawn off benches with writs as legit.
---
Fortunately now everyone just shows food or links a log in their description and its fine (dont hate on me for not showing food in pslb bench please...)
---
1.) The rewards. Having a specific challenge mode reward that can be used to purchase the red infusion is really cool. The additional pristine relics and fractal relics per day make it faster to get to desired goals that would otherwise be timegated more heavily. The secondary aspect is the challenge. The CM fractals feel like the mechanically hardest fracs in the game. They don’t just require team coordination, but individual skill (especially the tiles, combined with splaying rings, the deathballs, and anomoly on Arkk). 
---
2.) Different? making sure fractal instabilities don’t either kill or trivialize the encounter. In general, balancing classes with high-level fractals in mind would be great, as we went from being able to Run druid+chrono, or scourge+chrono or Alacrity Rev w/ quickness firebrand, to just Alacrity Rev and Quickbrand because the balancing team didn’t have 5-person content in mind.
---
3.) Honestly I would love it if the actual graphical effect of the space creatures was released as an infusion (i.e. the harbinger of woe). I really want an infusion that actually looks like that effect (with the destroyed world). Currebtly the red cele infusion just changes your skin. Also Viirastra has special leyline legging that don’t have the skirt, and it’d be awesome for that to drop somewhere.
---
4.) See #1. But especially I love the moments where a single player or 2 can clutch up when the fireteam dies and saves the encounter, or really, when any individual can sort of have breakout moments. The best experiences in 100cm I’ve had were barely eeking out a win on Arkk with 2 people by doing every correctly and thinking quickly.
---
Just don't dwl a new version of template tomorrow: it's not like delta can disable the version you have now.
---
That will be a truly sad day for this game.  My enjoyment of the game will be significantly reduced.
---
Anet is adding their own build templates in about two weeks. People are crying because they're manchild and can't save 20+ builds and will have to decide between about 6 or so stat templates to be able to instant swap between. They'll still be able to swap as much as they please, but god forbid they have to manually click some buttons.
---
I'm at the "grind map materials and pay 5 gold per collection item" phase and I can't exactly say it's anything close to fun.
---
&gt;Putting Fractal mechanic on open world. Let people learn stuff a bit. instead of jumping right into T4 which is crazy to see many uninformed people joining the run
---
That is what T1-T2-T3 is for.
---
You’re in the wrong because you need to blur out tags when posting content like this because reddit has an extremely strict no-witch-hunting policy in place for liability and in some cases legal reasons. Gw2 tags aren’t like steam or blizzard and you can directly identify an account with just the name alone.
---
You can get a subreddit banned for posting content like this, especially if it gets out of hand.
