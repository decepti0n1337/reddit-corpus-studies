Was this just one time event? Cause I never camp in LA so I missed it :( I'd love to burn my mithril for a title! :D

leaked legendary runes and sigil recipes?

Tailoring, Leatherworking, and Armorer player crafters can make them too (in with descriptions appropriate to the craft.) There are a zillion of them at the Auction House, priced very reasonably, as making a bunch of bags is often done while leveling crafting skill.
---
This is honestly really cool, would be awesome if they kept the "progression" with the two rings, giving you the fully evolved effect once all 4 are complete
---
I dunno about other folks, but when I saw that Vision was tied to Aurene, I was **really** hoping it would utilize the crystal aura effect from Prized Possessions when drawn.
---
The fact it's identical to Aurora is boring, even if they change the effect when stacked.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I never crafted Aurora, despite having all the achievements done and that unique gift fully made. I didn't because I don't like the effect. I was hoping Vision would be different, or at the very least we can hide the effects.
---
I'm a bit worried Coalescence will end up being the same thing as Aurora and Vision, with a bonus effect change if you have all three....
---
Unless it gets updated, I'll probably only finish the group events for the Vision achievements, and work on finishing Stellar, Heroic Dragonsblood, and other things before returning to finish Vision.
---
I just brush them off at this point. Or banter at them and salt them up.
---
thanks! seems weird we still dont have a megathread for the collection yet
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
TTS used to do it once a week. I did it several times, as recent as a few months ago.
---
I just finished my first legendary last night. I think I lucked out on that one.
---
Definitely thinking that
---
This was my reaction too. I love the idea that combining them gives a new effect. But alone they’re both the same? Such a disappointment.
---
Yeah he can do that too...just doesn’t usually. Too bad they haven’t fixed this since I’ve reporter it probably 30 or more times since PoF release

&gt; **Bug Fixes:**
---
&gt;
---
&gt;* Fixed an issue that caused the Black Lion Delivery Box to reward incorrect materials when expedition teams were assigned to certain locations.
---
&gt;* Recharging Teleport to Friend: Attempting to teleport while defeated will no longer cause the cooldown to be applied. Additionally, this item may no longer be used by characters under level 10.
---
&gt;* Fixed a bug that prevented the Branded Ley-Line Anomaly from appearing in the Domain of Vabbi.

Thx, I knew I should've crafted those ahead of time.

is this just for the two accessories or will the system be applied to the ring, too?

---
Is this legit? Not just somewhere in your inventory? Typed in the search bar and everything?  Not stacked with other +9s you might have in inventory? 
---
I’ll be hella pissed if any of my infusions are missing
---
Only 500k? Those are rookie numbers boy
---
Ahh I expected the draw effect to be something like the aurene ascension effect but its the same flying balls with the "cells attempting cytokinesis" effect when combined &gt;.&gt;. A colour change wont make much difference for me since Im a necro main and this effect (and most legendary auras) does not hv that 'spot on' aura for a dark-themed character :(
---
I agree in principle, but I fail to see how the test environment would miss how it would work on the live servers. The failure of the rewards to trigger is one thing, but I think the bigger issue is 5K karma for such a huge amount of resources is... not good? Like, anyone with a brain would tell you that this isn't a good idea. Hell, if ANet wanted to do this, why not just add a vendor who converts Mithril to karma at some fixed rate? Lore justification being that we're donating building materials to Elona.
---
If it's anywhere remotely evening-ish NA timeframe on Friday or Saturday I'm at work. I can play earlier in the day most days of the week (up to 3pm Mountain time) but that's never when anyone organizes anything. Even on weekends things get planned later, around reset time (3 hours later).
---
jokes on you,i found out about this *event* from reedit and i missed it completly. rip my 5k karma
---
Yeah, the last part of the event badly needs a rework, the invulnerability uptime on the boss is way too high. It needs more than just a slight reduction on the bosses' health.
---
OMG YES
---
Yours is always the one I recommend!  Love it's minimalist aesthetic.
---
Confirmed. Happened to a bunch of us. And this is an **old** bug too. wow
---
Still have Almorra and Dwayna's directive buffs despite. Oh well.
---
Well I sure as hell didn't attune and infuse rings and not slot agony infusions in there... And yeah I searched my bank and inventory.
---
This, I really don't like the effects of the legendary trinkets and not being able to toggle it off means I won't waste time working towards it since I know I won't use it because of how it looks...
---
While we're at it how's about fixing the animation so the balls orbit smoothly without stopping for half a second after each animation cycle
---
atleast make the ball colorable
---
Tempted to get both for the bubble effect, but most of the reason I'd go for the trinket rather than a weapon is because the trinket is half the cost... looks incredibly meh without both though.
---
With both, love the bubble effect. Weird that they share the *same* graphic so if you only wanted one accessory the choice doesn't matter.
---
The roadmap we got a while back mentioned legendary runes and sigils. I'm betting this is part of that, which isn't meant to be visible to us yet.
---
Mr. Miller is homeless no longer!
---
Low key hope he becomes the next hobotron.
---
Uhhhh that sawed off shotgun pistol, yes please.
---
New legendary trinket good thing ive been saving my gold.
---
in gw2 case is T5 matts that sell the most
---
and they removed the event after 2h , with a loss of half of TP stock lol
---
This is great!
---
How is that not how a sink works? That's literally how a sink works.
---
Update also removed the [recipe for the Gift of Upgrades](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu6tnx/new_mf_recipe/)
---
Removed with the hotfix update.
---
Can confirm
---
I mean it's not "bad" but it's not 4000-5000g good
---
Oh that's interesting? Is there some hidden legendary sigil recipe? That's kind of exciting
---
Interesting they changed Branded strongboxes to Branded Geodermites but still haven't fixed Branded strongboxes not dropping a piece of gear.
---
Damn your buff, she wants REVENGE. SHE WANTS THAT DRAGON *CRUSHED TO* ***SAND!***
---
When PoF released and both bounties and the new metas were unpopular with little reward, I shelved the game. Planned to come back if it ever got patched or when Season 4 ended, so I've only been back a couple weeks.
---
The ease of starting/stopping is one of the best features of this game. Let's me play when it's fun and not try to force myself to when it's not. But wow, they really should have patched the rewards a lot sooner it seems.
---
Join a guild with people who are online at the same time you are then. 
---
If you join a guild without a purpose you'll most likely be stuck without a purpose unless your purpose is only to make friends. The best guilds are the ones that have schedules and do things (eg. WvW guilds mostly, meta guilds, fractal/raid guilds, roleplay guilds, etc..).
---
Youre not missing out really. the core game wasen't made for mounts. ones you'll get to the expansions the game will give you what you need .
---
Personally, I wish it had a hide option.
---
that was kind of the point of this post..i have yet to find a guild that is active when i'm online...
---
I feel you man. I gave a couple of extra stacks, nothing much since I'm poor but I wanted to help and had some ingots in the bank, before the event was over my internet went down like it's been doing for the past days and when I came back the event was over and got nothing.
---
not trying to be a buzzkill but... that's super disappointing. It's uh, kinda goofy looking and not really that much of an upgrade.
---
Thanks! that's all I needed to know :)

Thanks!

you can see what the infusion looks like here  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu6mo6/mystic\_infusion/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu6mo6/mystic_infusion/) 
---
basically just like the halloween reverb infusions but lightblue/white
---
(I hecking agree with you but hot damn apparently 7 days of timegating is a holocaust now).
---
have it display like the one in the video if you have both.. but have vision a whole different color by itself..
---
That's what she said ...
---
That's what I was joking today about. Coalessence probably gonna have same aura and a moon spinning around the waist. 
---
I rly hope it will be something unique. Dislike both accessories, so I wanna at least have a ring.
---
Roughly 3 days. They removed the 24 hour daily reset gate between collection tiers, but the skyscale feeding still needs daily resets (they changed it from 3 feedings a day for 4 days to 4 feedings for 3 days), that's at the fastest if you buy all the time gated stuff like Skyscale Food and whatnot, but also not counting the time-gated crafted skip treats for the jumping puzzle section of the collections.
---
3 days min if what I hear is correct and you can still only give 4 feed/day in one step of the collection
---
General path: collection in dragonfall x3 -&gt; time gate -&gt; collection in the world -&gt; charged quartz lamp and feeding (22 charged quartz total; 12 feeds over 3 days) + killing things collection -&gt; time gate -&gt; jumping puzzle/boss collection + play with skyscale -&gt; time gate -&gt; saddle crafting (250 of each s4 currency) -&gt; visit rifts collection
---
And when build templates come it'll be so much better
---
you can't use numbers in character names
---
If you think PoF is hard then I imagine you must have a really shoddy build, on top of using really bad or default keybinds.
---
We would sooner see a video from you on your gameplay so we can give advice on what you are doing wrong, then a video guide on PoF.
---
If you really insist, there are plenty of let's play videos on Youtube, but I doubt there are guides to finish the story. This isn't dark souls.
---
I consulted no videos nor guides and breezed through everything, no difficulty in mastery points or story instances. All I can say is you probably aren't trying hard enough, especially for the mastery points.
---
BIG YIKES
---
Some people are still picking up the game for the first time and curious about raiding. What's old content to us is new to them. I think it's a giant plus that new players interested in raiding can come into what's about to be 7 wings of relevant raid content as opposed to ffxiv where you get 5 bosses maybe two more if you attempt ultimate.
---
LOVELY! I WANT THIS!
---
Which is 1. turning Mithril into an account-bound currency rather than a publicly-traded one and 2. in order to turn the karma back into Mithril, a huge percentage of the initial mithril is lost.
---
Happened to me aswell... this is so annoying, costed me a lot of gold

So how did u get it?

You can donate 10k Mithril to me...i will send n00dz
---
I legit stopped playing my necro because I got bad habits from it. I never bothered to dodge, the life steal, damage reduction and two health bars gave so much survival it was crazy.
---
Complete opposite of my thief where 99% of damage mitigation is dodge / be somewhere else when hit lands.
---
Fractals were tweaked to discourage pugging. 
---
And many lone wolfs stopped doing fractals.  
---
Fractals were recently tweaked again to make them less hostile to pugs.  
---
I keep saying I will get back to doing them. But find myself doing other content, less rewarding but less hassle.

Beat the story the start the [Newborn Skyscales](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Newborn_Skyscales) collection which requires you to collect scales, buy medicine (which takes 10 events in each lane), find sick skyscales, find eggs, wait till reset. Next is [saving skyscales](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Saving_Skyscales) where you have one large collection broken up into 12 parts one for each egg type, most require you to just go to 2-3 locations that are all marked on the map, a couple others need events done or to just kill enemies or revive allies, all pretty easy just make sure you unlock them all first since there is a lot of overlap and you may have to do the [dwarven puzzle](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Rune-Locked_Doors) in desert highlands unless someone is there to port you. After you wait for the time gate again you can do [raising skyscales](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raising_Skyscales), you can now feed up to 4 times per "day" so you need a minimum of 3 resets to feed your skyscale. You get some toys (a few gold), some treats (drop pretty fast from kills of the listed types), and importantly a [grow lamp](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grow_Lamp). The grow lamp and food both require [charged quartz](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charged_Quartz_Crystal) so make sure you have it or get ready to buy the finished items. After reset again you get [Troublesome Skyscales](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Troublesome_Skyscales) where you have to go to a bunch of jumping puzzle locations and a couple events. play with your skyscale the wait on reset again. [Riding Skyscales](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Riding_Skyscales) importantly needs 250 of each living story season 4 currency, 1500 volatile magic,  and 500 trade contracts as well as a total of 35g. You can see a way [more detailed guide here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/brs41g/complete_skyscale_unlock_guide/).
---
Yeah lot of people have left the game by now. Could have been so much better earlier
---
I just put things players might want in the guild bank.
---
K so we can't clear this raid while naked then
---
Raid chests don't stack mate :(\*
---
&gt; Plus my guildmates, as the game calls them, constantly go Leroy Jenkins and pull in other mobs not involved in the battles I started. 
---
Then why is this an issue?
---
Honestly I do agree, I'd love if GW2 could support all its audiences as well as open world/story, but I also think it's pretty clear they realized this was the most profitable way to budget their labor quite some time ago
---
Personally I couldn't care less.  I'm happier with a shipped product, without a unique aura, than a not shipped product.
---
I know! How dare those peasants be given such access to something that should belong to the the idle rich with the time to grind out chests across maps for months and even years.  I bet they won't even appreciate the beauty of each song.
---
If you're going to quit the game can I have all your stuff?
---
&gt; Ectoplasmic Stone
---
Yeah, at 25 ectos is just too expensive. And ecto price is currently jumping.
---
That is the implication when you bring up how the story has "massive battles" and "goes on forever", when HoT story instances can be longer and involve much more fighting with larger groups of enemies. 
---
PoF mobs melt by comparison, how long can they take?
---
There are at least 5 mastery points that can be accessed without anything else but the raptor, and with the mastery points from the story, I don't understand how you couldn't have canyon jump on raptor yet.
---
What else can you have spent PoF mastery points on? Volatile magic collector? If that's the case you only slightly gimped yourself for going out of order, even though the game gives you more than enough freedom to do so if you at least know how to get mastery points.
---
You need a total of 102 mastery points to max every single thing, but there are 130 points available in the game.
---
That is likely the next step up or it combined with the raid one, since clones with aurora are showing the combined aura for vision+aurora.
---
The barrel roll saves the skyscale imo, but griffon and Springer will always have a place with my toons. I think anet's done a great job specializing the mounts so far, that they each excel somewhere others don't.
---
It happened with this patch.
---
Except build templates won't help you with the "needing to have and carry around multiple sets of armor/trinkets" issue at all.
---
Slightly better quality screenshot: https://imgur.com/HGmuTl4
---
It's just annoying that they pull random stuff instead of the same mobs I'm attacking. I didn't notice this being a thing before.
---
Farm for gold. I don't understand what your point of posting this is if you don't want gems.
---
You put in your ticket.   
---
That's the best course of action.   
---
They'll get to you.
---
this is all heresay; but I think the stat-reset went by the following rules:
---
- **Was it stat selectible on purchase?**  
---
if **No**: Don't reset!  
---
if **Yes**: ask following questions:
---
 - does it have all stats available already? Y: Don't reset!
---
 - is it part of a collection? Y: Don't reset!  
---
(source: my weapons from the elite spec collections didn't reset)
---
 - has it been stat-swapped? Y: Don't reset!  
---
(source: you lose runes/infusions on weapons when you stat-swap them as the forge replaces it for a different weapon)
---
 - Is it something you buy for currency, but it has only limited stats? reset!
---
 - Is it from a box which had limited selections available? reset!  
---
(needs confirmation)
---
Are you sure?  I was able to pick the stats on my Mawdrey after this update.
---
Why not wait until they change it to get it? If you get it, that sends the message that it's okay.
---
by those rules it should be resetable
---
did you already have it crafted and a stat selected? mine was equipped when i logged in with the stat i had on it originally
---
Ah ic, ty for info.
---
&gt; is it part of a collection? Y: Don't reset!
---
Mawdrey is a collection.
---
The rerolls mostly didn't happen, so we have no idea what's intended and what's not.
---
Example, none of my LS3 trinkets on my characters reset with the update. Most of the trinkets in my bank *did* reset. But only *two* out of the *three* Black Ice Earrings in my bank reset. Same item, same place, only two out of three.
---
does that include Diviner's? (I haven't checked my Mawdrey yet)
---
i will not even talk about how fuckign lazy it is,but when you wana this effect on more chars,you are fucked.you can have 2 chars with 2 auroras or 1 with vision.
---
Considering how stage 2 is actually uglier than stage 1, who knows at this point lol
---
what collection? as far as i know, i never completed any collections crafting it in the mystic forge with all those grow lamps and copious amounts of gold
---
That would be all well and good, if the reset was consistent across multiples of the exact same item.
---
Like I mentioned below, none of my LS3 trinkets on my characters reset. Most in my bank did reset. Except, I had three Black Ice Earrings in my bank, and only *two* of them reset. The third one still has stats.
---
You're making it too big of a deal.
---
thats what im wondering, mine didnt reset, but i was banking on it reseting so i could put diviner's on it, this guy says his reset
---
so its broken atm? is everyone having issues?
---
Thanks, people in my guild will help with this, too, if needed.
---
well i need to infuse it anyway i guess, i might as well try that
---
I wonder how this'll mix with celestial infusions.
---
it's not even that, it's just that mithril comes from fucking everything, there are too many nodes and it is the most common salvaged ore.
---
Is it going to be in the store? I see people wearing it but no way to get it.
---
Because it is OK. What? This isn't come controversy. They have changed (some very drastically) legendary effects in the past.
---
The cosmetics are not why I am getting the legendary, at least not the whole reason and there IS a cosmetic change that goes in to having two. I already have aurora so I will get this cosmetic alteration even if ANet don't change it. 
---
I was simply putting in my two cents that I wish they would change it, not at all that I'm on some kind of high horse boycott because its an outrage. I will save my outrage for something important. Like anti-consumer bs.
---
I rather have a Zhaitan World boss.
---
Love this community. I had this generous guy who gave me 20g and another who gave me 250 Elderwood. They were people I just met while running around during the World Bosses events.
---
To think there are people that call this game "toxic"
---
why you weird ppl just dont sit on mount,when you wana afk anyway? kinda funny how all ppl cryed about timegate and now all who rushed skyscale just afk hover in la..
---
Thank you for the album! Handsome character, too!
---
And to think players from other mmos call this playerbase "toxic"
---
He's right about everything and only exists on a higher plane of understanding than everyone else. History will look back upon us with a baleful eye because we didn't heed his words.
---
He's quite literally linking a post in which the community generates and votes on feedback
---
Every other playerbase also calls eachother toxic, yet this one and warfarm are the only ones that seem to not give a damn. Go figure
---
He just linked a thread
---
Same, ~50g wasted. Also I have to do some champions multiple times to get the relating achievements unlocked
---
I think by "trinkets" he only meant the two existing ones.
---
Anyone who's ever had a stack overflow error will beg to differ. Fun fact: GPS has had to reset TWICE because it literally ran out of numbers. We are now on the third GPS epoch.
---
They definitely should have done something like twilight and sunrise. Dark and Light, it would have made a color combo effect similar to the equinox weapon sets.
---
Ex: people want to have the scyscale as soon as possible, so they need to get working on the time gate. However, they also want to be one of the first people to complete the new raid.
---
Do you have a source for this? Where did you pull this from?
---
Box of Viper's Gear gives me a bunch of not Viper's Gear choices.
---
https://i.imgur.com/StVc0uY.png
---
Tbh I wouldn't be surprised if this trinket was only added because everyone was really upset that there wasn't one with episode release. It'd make sense if they share the same skin. Too bad, I thought it was gonna be Aurene themed, due to the patch notes, "relive your journey in guiding Aurene to fulfill her destiny".
---
They probably really did only plan on Skyscale as the endgame collection for LS4, with it being more accessible to everyone.
---
Someone save OP and buy it xD
---
Did they ever add a way to disable these effects? Not a fan at all of having orbs constantly floating around like that, but would like the convenience the items give.
---
I jumped the gun and bought this immediately. Disappointed its just some generic skyscale. Does anet allow refunds for this? I can keep it, i knew chairs aren't dyeable, just sad to miss out on such a cool feature for this novelty item.
---
Gorrik wouldn't lie to you. He is an Elonian prince and he will make us all rich if only we send some money his way
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pile_of_Elemental_Essence
---
Not much i'd say.
---
iirc, there have been hints from devs suggesting that Evon's victory would have lead to a more-prepared Lion's Arch when Scarlet finally attacked. Theoretically, we could have saved Lion's Arch from total destruction under Evon's lead. How much of a difference it would make beyond that is anyone's guess.
---
Mount interactions?
---
Oh wow. They moved fast on that one. I sort of feared they would forget about it  Thanks!
---
LS1 was the best Lion's Arch. We got to experience Pirate LA, Vigil Keep LA, Under Attack LA, and Rubble LA.
---
I love them all dearly.
---
He's quite literally linking to his own post.
---
Getting a hundred-or-so upvotes on a Reddit thread doesn't turn his personal criticisms into "community feedback".
---
I’m 17 dyes away from completion. I doubt you are offering anything I need, but god damn try me anyway and I’ll let you know. I’m so close!
---
\&gt; not stack too many obnoxious auras but at the same time   
---
Yes, players are already more than capable of doing that themselves.
---
"Defend Akili while he recalibrates mirrors around the Astralarium" is super-bugged. you cannot complete the event. he just rubberbands back and forth

got his own gs,trinkets and now CLONES!

I still don't have half the mounts :(

I didn't really look into what I want right now. I guess something that would be too tough so I can get the gist of things. Any Recommendations? I'm a spellbreaker who uses a dagger and axe btw.

---
Generally speaking, the response time to a ticket is about 72 hours if it's something more complex than just say a refund. Particularly with account ownership, care has to be taken. Probably doesn't help that this was a holiday weekend and there were likely less people on. 
---
Obviously there's a queue for tickets, but I suspect tickets are sorted into stuff anyone can help with and stuff that has to be bumped up to a higher up in the chain.
---
There was a period of time were tickets were backlogged for weeks but that's been over a long time. You should have your answer pretty soon.
---
Most importantly, never create a second ticket. Always update your current ticket if you're adding or requesting information. Making another ticket just moves you to the back of the queue.
---
Ahem, phrasing.
---
Did Forged with Fire today. No hero’s choice chest.

Imagine how many people that quit just left things posted. Everytime you search for something it gets the data on all those listings.

When you decide that you want one and you have a full functional set of gear for the builds you like.

I've been doing T3 fractals for a while and I think it's time for me to move up.  I've been playing mostly Reaper, but I've been learning Healbrand as well.  Healbrand seems to be much more desirable from looking at postings in LFG for T4.  I'm at a bit of a loss though for what to do with my utility skills.  Mantra of Solace/Mantra of Potence/X/X/Feel My Wrath! seems like what I'd run every time.  I don't really know what to fill in for those two slots.  I've checked the MetaBattles page for HealBrand, but my understanding of specific needs for specific fractals isn't strong enough to make much sense of it.  I suppose what I really am looking for is an in-depth guide to skill loadouts for all T4 fractals.

No mention of statue updates... come on wild magic 🙏
---
It won't take very long if you plan out where you're going to get pieces (many methods to choose from) and start slowly working towards it.
---
Also pick a gear set that will be useful for the end game build you want to use, there's no other point for full ascended.
---
i have tried it. 3 times. also multiple areas now. always the same. i cant make achivements to pop up. :(
---
You literally are saying you are not the community to someone... and then hiding behind "the community" which you think are people who share your point of view Lol.... take your own advice "stop trying to speak for all of us". Toxic ass mob thinking mofos.
---
which map are you on? a few of us in Sandswept had the issue of doing the wrong rift multiple times
---
Same.. i have the precursor for aurora for a long time but never made it because I don’t like it. Was very excitedly working on getting vision and so happy I was basically almost done with it (only need 3 more astral weapons) and now this... -.- I’ll just finish this collection and then have two legendary precursors, whatever.
---
did Path to Ascension yesterday after the patch - no hero's choice chest so far
---
Having the particle effect evolve as a result of collecting more legendary trinkets is ingenious. As others have pointed out, the advantages include minimizing the visual clutter and encouraging late adopters to go back and complete old legendaries, therefore populating old living world maps again.
---
I think ArenaNet has already considered the cons of this approach, which is mainly, alienating those who didn't like the effect of Aurora in the first place.
---
I don't think there's much ArenaNet can do for that demographic unfortunately, other than to deploy a QOL fix to allow users to turn off the particle effect so they can at least go for the legendary stat change feature.
---
The request to at least have different colors for the base effect for Aurora and Vision is a reasonable one though. I'll further add that the evolved effect of having both Aurora and Vision should be even more defined. Hopefully ArenaNet will get around to making these changes.
---
If you think these are long fights, in Hearts and Minds (the finale Of HoT), have Brahmn come with you into the dream. That blighted Ranger (not saying anymore because of spoilers) is super hard to kill. Took me an hour and a half to get her on my Druid.

Someone tell noxxi to make this into a video with the laughing latino dude

Be sure to check out the video on the post itself.
---
Focus really isn't useful to you. Just run scepter/torch and axe/nothing, when you weapon swap you'll use the torch in both sets with the need for a second one. Condi firebrand isn't really "meta" in fractals since power dragonhunter and power (quickness) firebrand are much better. Firebrand is one of the more bursty condi DPS builds but it still doesn't compare to power builds in fractals. I would look at the [condition firebrand build for raids](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition/) or even metabattle's [condi fractal build](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Firebrand_-_Condi_DPS). If you do decide to gear power [dT](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand) and [SC](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/power%20quickness/) both have builds on that as well as the [condi quickness](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/firebrand/condition%20quickness/) version in raids.
---
If you're only talking about open world metabattle's [open world variant](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Firebrand_-_Burning_Tome) does list sword, focus, and greatsword as options as well. I agree with their suggestions since sword gives a teleport (and a little projectile protection), focus does have a good block, and greatsword has a pull. Overall though these weapons don't have any synergy with condition damage builds as opposed to axe and torch that provide a lot of bleeding and burning.
---
Well you don't need it if you don't want it.
---
From what I guess you mean that trinkets, accessories etc should be skins as well, so you can slot them on other characters as well.  
---
Yes, this should be adressed. But please, work on your wording. That is horrible
---
It's been in the game since the sigil/rune salvage rework. I have a screenshot of it from December last year.   
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/0pwPt6N](https://imgur.com/a/0pwPt6N)  (screenshot of the discord message with date + the original screenshot)
---
  
---
I have no idea if it would have worked back then since I didn't have enough materials and the recipe seemed to randomly disappear (turning into the "get one random rune/sigil" recipe instead).
---
I'm also a warrior, I just finished crafting my Eternity greatsword. I've always really liked Incincerator for a dagger, there's also the option of Frostfang for axe.. Do you have the expansions? Gen 1 legendaries are a better place to start then Gen 2 legendaries, Gen 2 legendaries are more complicated and more expensive to craft.
---
You'll want to start off by getting Map Completion for every single zone in Core Tyria. Just sweep the world map by map completing every heart, vista, POI, hero point &amp; waypoint. This will get you your Gift of Exploration.
---
If you don't play WvW, you'll need to start. Assign the Gift Of Battle Reward track in the WvW tab, otherwise you won't be progressing towards your Gift you need for your legendary. Using XP boosters, food, banners, to maximize reward track gain IS VERY HELPFUL to minimize time spent in WvW.
---
Across your travels, you're going to acquire materials and gold. I would recommend salvaging all junk or gear you won't use for more materials. Youre going to want to get as many materials as possible, you're going to need a stack of every single T6 material for your gift of fortune. That gets very pricey. You will also need a stack of ectos, and a stack of obsidian. 
---
A good way to get ectos is doing Dungeons that are above level 68, buying the rares for 30 tokens a piece and salvaging them for ectos. You can get rares from doing just about anything, ectos will come with time.
---
Obsidian has MANY MANY ways of obtaining it, I'd reccommend checking the wiki and seeing which currencies you have the most of to spend on shards and work from there. I mainly used Bandit Crests and Volatile Magic as means to buy my Obsidian.
---
If you don't already, you need the corresponding crafting professions at max level for the legendary youre making. For example; I'm a warrior and I was crafting Twilight. So I needed Armorsmithing and Weaponsmithing maxed. Then you'll need to buy the two corresponding Gift recipes for that specific legendary you chose from Miyani by the mystic forge
---
Crafting the precursor is a good alternative to throwing rares into the Mystic Forge and hoping for a precursor that may never drop. If you are crafting the precursor, you're going to need LOTS of ascended materials.. Start doing your ectoplasm refinements every single day, (because you can only craft one per day) and make as much deldrimor steel as possible. You can pick the Recipe for the Precursor up from the Vendors by all the crafting stations in LA. They're standing on pedestals, and also marked on the map, so they're hard to miss. 
---
Save all your Mystic Coins from your login rewards, youre going to need LOTS to craft your 77 clovers you will need for your gift of fortune. You'll also need lots of spirit shards, and more obsidian to craft clovers. 
---
TLDR: Lots of Youtubers and online guides will explain this far better than I ever could. I hope I included a few tips or insights that you can find useful. It's a long and expensive process, don't try and rush it just enjoy the ride. It's more fun that way.
---
Completely missed this event... gg for those living in different parts of the world.
---
I think they should enhance the combined visual effect, the effect difference isn't that much considering you are crafting 2 legendary trinkets. I just hope they enhance it a bit more, they enhanced Eternity effects before. This is almost the same idea, a combined legendary with greater visual effects.
---
It's 5% listing, that makes 500g.
---
10% is only when trade is successfully made
---
[Black Lion Garden Plot Deed](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Black_Lion_Garden_Plot_Deed) as well
---
Right -- so this *brand new content* would be more likely to use that tech if it existed.
---
just wait til we find out that coalescence is just the same effect on its own and a slight alteration when equipped with aurora and vision
---
This is the result of being forced to make it the same because there is no game tech to make them dyeable and also no game tech to turn their effects on and off. They have to look good together st once or you can’t get the stat perk of having more legendary gear. Anet needs to just understand that at some point they need to stahp building new things on totally dated tech and finally do what needs to be done and allow all items/weapons/chairs/trinkets effects/infusion effects/etc to be dyed, and add toggle switches to effects. There is no other intelligent way to move forward. Honestly I would be down to delay content so they can fix this. I mean just look at the uproar of the skyscale chair being undyeable, all the hundreds of ‘can’t dye this weapons’ posts, the list goes on and on...
---
True there's some skyscale specific things to do
---
This is probably what happens when you add the ring that will come in a few weeks
---
Blazeridge is ***south*** of the rental, not north.
---
Please, I agree... Fix this and make it the same color and or skin, PLEASE!
---
Condition firebrand is fine in raids where the bosses give enough time for your damage to ramp up. If you want to be pure DPS in fractals then DH will be better pure damage and burst with the hybrid firebrand build provides much needed quickness to your group and partially replaces the need for a chronomancer (it's best run with a [renegade](https://discretize.eu/builds/revenant/hybrid-renegade) to cover alacrity). If this is your first character or build getting the optimal power gear is still a lot easier compared to condition damage. I'm still in the process of updating the guide right now but [this guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) has a lot of suggestions and options for getting gear.
---
Does the silverwastes still give tons of this stuff?
---
Springer: have us sit up against its belly
---
Beetle: we lay on our backs on-top of it
---
Skimmer: acts like a hammock
---
&gt;I also want to note that, for this version of the World Meta Event, we did not have enough time to make any changes to the Defend events that occur as a part of the Arah Metas. These defend events will kick off like normal after a successful attack and do not have additional rewards for completing them. It is our intention to address this if we run another event that targets the Arah Meta attack events, but we won’t be able to do that for this event.
---
Killing bloodstone crazed creatures, doing HoT events, I think you can also get them in the airship cargo in Verdant Brink, doing the dailies, from events in Silverwastes/Lost Bandit Chests, possibly Dry Top events too. Some people have a bloodstone node in their home instance so you can ask around to see if they'll let you mine it.
---
Except instead of doing this within a year like HoT 2.0, they took almost 2. The timing of this improvement only seems to make more stark the amount of neglect suffered by GW2 as a result of the resources squirreled away to other projects until the layoffs.
---
I've been using many exotics level 80 for the past half hour and tons of ectoplasmic stones. I've spent at least 150 g and have gotten:
---
The Legend
---
Spark
---
Sunder
---
Fealty
---
Venom
---
as my main highlights.
---
Also if im not remembering wrong, home instance was changed little too. Before, you couldnt jump over the "fence" in the stairs and had to go thro all the stairs. Now you can jump over them.
---
I might be wrong tho, I barely go there outside daily gatherer
---
The vision is disappointing. Same effect is just lame and really makes no sense, because the look of Aurora is not very compatible with many fashion wars looks. It goes well with mesmer, but for example fire warrior theme with purple balls do not match well. 
---
The combined effest is also disappointing. It could be class specific, it could be many things, but it is just an additional animation to aurora animation. Why not special effect for different skills, classes, like new leggy GS has. I mean this is a leggy trinket, which is not a skin, but items, so it should be even more special than normal leggy skins.
---
I dont mind if it take 6 months, i just want to see anet saying that they will change this asap.
---
Yeah Ive got stacks of them now from just a few runs.
---
So, you are aware her plan isn't done. The plan of replacing destructive cycle of dragons isnt done. The problems of magical corruption is not fixed. The only thing that is accomplished is aurene becoming an elder dragon.
---
So saying her plan is completed is objectively wrong.
---
Probably coalescence which is in game but locked until w7 releases
---
Could... could he be E?
---
Bugs that make it to live game make it 100% uncatched for us though.
---
Do it. Give in. If you're a support-type player, there's tons of that in GW2! Tanks are... as others have said, pretty much just raids.
---
But you can be a tanky support with good positioning I suppose. The flexibility is good. The lack of trinity bugged me too, now I love it. Healer does still exist in every bit of content though for a number of professions.
---
I've seen a couple people today with the Junundu Whisperer title on, so I'm not sure if more people are going back to these maps, or they did a pass on some of the events that were buggy.
---
jahai gave me a consumable item that made me crystalline for like 60 seconds
---
The Flesh Golem elite for necros already works like this. First press summons, second press commands it to charge at an enemy
---
Wow, mesmer nerfs came early
---
I mean, with the "Leader of the Pack" SB Trait, Stances behave like Shouts. But yeah, commands also overlap with potential shouts functionality.
---
Any chance you can /wiki both of those? Maybe they sneakily added a new version of it...Do they have the same exact name?
---
So, are we ever going to get the ability to transmute to Aurora. Having it on one character is quite lame for a legendary. Especially with the effort required. Henge was a true chore.
---
It's lazy, it's unoriginal, it's the new Anet way
---
“Yes”  
---
In reality, you’d only be able to sell like 10 a day, so that 700g would take a while to come in
---
1. When you hit level 80, start collecting mastery points and unlock auto-loot first.
---
2. If you're in HoT or PoF, the meta events are all around, and each map has different ones. Auric Basin has the Defend Tarir event, which is on a timer, so check the wiki for that. Same with the other HoT maps. The wiki is your friend. therefore, sometimes you can't start the event when a timer is what decides.
---
Honestly, just play the maps and you'll learn what's the event. Check the LFG too for that specific map! If you want to try to get good at meta events in general, start with the Silverwastes. Drop-wise, Chak Gerant has a TINY chance of dropping an aura. Each meta can give a precursor if you're super duper lucky (so can any drop in the game). You're mainly gathering materials for yourself or to sell.
---
If you want some videos, try googling Defend Tarir, Chak Gerant, Dragon's Stand, Virdent Brink meta, etc.
---
IIRC Amalgamated Stones were worth around 1g/piece, and you can het one from each Hero's Choice Chest from all 4 HoT metas. All HoT metas have a BLC device announcing them.
---
Also devs stated in this post all the metas that will be included in this week event:  https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/weeklong-bonus-event-meta-event-rush/
---
As per items, if doing them [the metas], you will get ton of loot. Basically, just get into LFG and look for metas, as they will be advertise there by the commies. Or, just get into a map and look for commies. 
---
This site will help you a lot as well: http://gw2timer.com/
---
Good Luck!
---
Sorry i wrote that wrong, I meant PoF armor skins. Is there even some armor to unlock ?
---
what if?
---
Cool thanks. Is the unlock auto-loot in the options?
---
Cool thanks. Are metas only on level 80 maps?
---
But we know when, how and why he went to the mists. What am i missing here?
---
Nice one, wasa wasa wasa.
---
Cool thanks!!
---
Im on board ever since I made Quip for stat switching.
---
arc build templates don't help with that, if anet is smart they will make proper build templates have multiple gear slots so our bags are free
---
Please no. I like my legendary items for the convenience of stat and infusion swapping and not the visual effects. This works fine for legendary armor and weapons but the forced visuals on legendary trinkets is really disappointing. I want to make the ring as I really enjoy raiding (despite its faults) and it is the main content I play but it will sit in my bank or never go past the precursor if it looks as gaudy as this without an option to hide.
---
Next time please hide nicknames, thank you
---
If you play trough Living world Season 2 you're going to find your answer there, I won't spoil much :)
---
Is that intended? Or an oversight on ANets side?
---
So once you hit level 80, you start collecting mastery points which are rewards for certain achievements or just somewhere on the map. Then, you put them into different mastery lines to unlock the skills. 
---
https://imgur.com/a/fS0h1c0
---
Then, I think you can turn it on/off in the options afterwards.
---
My work vacations end in june 4 :(
---
From what I've been told all exotic bags you open on a lvl 53 char then salvage and sell it... if it's an exotic weapon then yeah sell it. The things that are "worth a lot of money" would be infusion like aurillium from auric basin meta but it's like a needle in a haystack rng... good luck.
---
For meta events make sure you search the LFG and find a squad that's doing them or you can pray that coms will tag up to attract more people later on as events are being done... you'll know if it's meta after a few times familiarize yourself with the pre-events. You can tell if it's a meta usually by looking at the map description in top right hand corner of screen e.g; auric basin meta is usually stuff like "0/3 pylons activated" or "mordrem are preparing to assault tarir".
---
You can check which map you are in by typing /ip look for a specific number to those listed in LFG to see if you are in the same map and if not you can join squad and then right click on anyone that's greyed out -&gt; "Join in ____ map". Gotta be on the same map name though + the map mustn't be full for it to work.
---
Lastly is gear yourself for DPS + know when to CC. CC meaning crowd control which relates directly to many bosses' green/teal looking bar (one below the health bar) that needs to be broken and when that happens everyone tries to dump as much DPS as possible. CC (hard or soft) can mean any skill that does knockbacks, knockdowns, pulls, pushes, even some conditions like slow, immobilize, fear, chilled. Some bosses CC bars function differently in that you absolutely need to CC within a certain time period or get rekt by some OP skill as opposed to "just CC it over time".
---
Hope that helps. Auric Basic is probably my favorite (and easiest) meta if I had to choose one.
---
Not sure what they'll do regarding the aura, but I'd guess that the rings will have something of their own. It makes sense for the unsheathed effect of the accessories to be near the head. I'd think that there'd be some unique effect around the hands or waist.
---
Anyone got a screenshot of this before it gets patch?
---
they're only account bound. you can put them in your bank or a shared slot to move them between characters
---
I've tried playing DH/DPS FB and I just don't enjoy the skills.  I like Reaper (geared) and BS Warrior (lacking armor/weapons) much more, and somewhat enjoy playing Elementalist (both elites geared).  I wanted the Healbrand so I could have more options in groups.  I would rather play Reaper/BS/Elementalist if I was going to be DPS.
---
[Here’s a thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu8jb8/clones_have_a_different_effect_with_aurora_vision/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2)
---
I feel you. Spent a month crafting Astralaria. Was happy for about 5 seconds until I put it on my charr :&gt;  
---
oh looorrdddd the[ CLIPPING](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/106961097591902208/571973151135629320/unknown.png). Burst into tears on the spot.  
---
 Remember to ask others that has the weapon to test it out on the race you will be using it on.
---
I like that they have a unique effect when combined, but I would have liked to see Vision alone have something different from Aurora.
---
Why are you expecting a sink to give you something worth?
---
i lost one because of this
---
I dress whatever I want and just wield the legendary.
---
Why? It's a special weapon that's why.
---
What's the point of it looking unique and out of this world if I force my character to make it blend in.
---
At minimal my clothes' colour scheme will lighten or darken to match the radiance or darkness the weapon is themed after but that's about it really.
---
Played since launch, and if I've beaten him before, I still dont know who he is
---
I think? Depends on the armor you’re talking about. More gold from selling amalg and some drops are more common, metas are predictable. Each armor set requires something different so you gotta find out if the update changed anything to help with it.
---
Sadly..you're wrong. It's not even the default color. It uses custom dye channels.
---
Same here, and yep it's the combined Aurora/Vision effect
---
&gt; instead
---
can people like different things? sheesh
---
It's not even that. I had a Berserker's backpack on my Weaver that reset. It was skinned over but the original item was Mawdrey (which means it's been Berserker for literally years but hey now my Mawdrey can select any stat in the game!)
---
Gliders are from HoT, so you wont be able to get that. To get mounts, you just need to get to level 80 and do the first chapter of the PoF story. That will get you a raptor.
---
I'm still waiting for that explanation.
---
Well they have said that the rune/sigil crafting change was in part for legendary runes/sigils.
---
Nope, they just added it to feed the gemstore like they did with the LS3 one. At the rate you get materials it would be way faster to just go to the zone and farm it. Also, for people that don't want to farm intensively zones theres the home-instance node. I barely much playtime on Istan myself (no palawadan farming for me) and still had more than 8K ore. It was predictable that the new trinket would require them. The main fear people had (me included) for quite a long time is that anet might have asked for the entire weapon collection and not just 6.
---
If you want to think of a real thing they changed to make the craft of Vision easier it's the increased drop in elegy mosaics and the removal of the cap in funerary incense. (Consider that the Legendary raid ring will probably need these too since it's a PoF legendary). The cap would have been very annoying.
---
I wish someone gave me a 32 bag slot tbh
---
There's literally nothing you can do. All you can do is hope Anet look into it and find the cause of the inconsistency then do another reset.
---
Spoiler tag real quick! Before people who haven't done the story see.
---
I wonder if it wouldn't be better for this weeklong bonus event and regular playtime to just put the Orr temple events (back) on schedule just like HoT and PoF have their meta times. Unless of course modifying these chains in proper way is time-consuming task which is not worth investing for core map content, especially of such age. Still, adding one and maybe even boosting rewards (especially chance for all those exclusive exotics like Dwayna's Embrace, Rotbeard's Treasure or Melandru's Bloom - two first dropped for me once *before* megaservers update and never after) would make this part of the game attractive again - especially considering this is a place that ultimately leads to fight with the elder dragon; attractive and an interesting alternative for HoT, PoF and Silverwastes openworld content.  ranted, if schedule would be implemented then people would farm temple events as they do with HoT and PoF but that would also mean these maps would become more alive, active than they are now and that's the main positive thing.
---
Back before megaservers update, I was doing temple events on daily regular basis but after that, it's just literally once in a blue moon. If I recall correctly, the explanation for removing map copies and world synchronization of the Orr temple events state was that those should feel epic and require some community participation. That certainly *didn't* worked and neither feels epic to have a luck of being in map that has reach necessary events progress.
---
Who needs Firebrigade when we have Gorrbrand.
---
10k gold for this garbage ? 
---
The effect is dogshit
---
I have found myself that the first time you interact you won't get the buff, you have to wait a little and interact a 2nd time.
---
The one bug i have found myself is that Amala doesn't give credit for the Istan collection with the correct item in the inventory.
---
Triple Trouble is  on bloodtide coast,  Tequatl is on Sparkfly Fen. Having said that, the definition of a "meta event" is a bit fuzzy, some people may not call these metas. The Orr maps have some metas, but they aren't played much.
---
It's cool that *Drakin Cinderspire* finally got some love but I still believe this champion along with its meta should be turned into regular scheduled world boss. Unless this is just a nod of where were heading in Season 5.
---
I noticed you said you don't have HoT. Auric basin is a HoT map, so you wont be able to do it. Silverwastes is probably the most popular meta if you don't have HoT.
---
As others have pointed out you can get Bloodstone dust various ways
---
[here are some more ways](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pile_of_Bloodstone_Dust) like Verdant brink Airship cargo or Crystallized Supply Cache in Tangled depths or the Jade Fragments in lake dorric (though requires season 3).
---
You need the Bloodstone to create [lesser vision crystals](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Lesser_Vision_Crystal) that you can get from an achievement, the "feed-me" items like Princess. You can also get it from salvaging other Ascended gear. HOWEVER, If you want to get a particular ascended gear stat you have other ways to get it and select or even swap the stats that you need.
---
You can find them in Fractals and earn them in PvP and WvW. In PvP and WvW you need to first unlock the exotic piece and then can buy the Ascended piece with which you then can select the attribute combination and even have the precursor for the legendary armour.
---
Btw the Greatsword looks also awesome on the other classes and has special animations. The showcase in the trailer was only on a Mesmer.
---
2 and a half years for a single legendary trinket is **ridiculous.** full stop.
---
Because it also states "Visions of a Dragon" which is one specific category within those collections.
---
The end of your print key?
---
A researcher stands next to the mystic forge in LA and wants Mithril Ingots.
---
Would recommend getting the HoT expansion so you can do the story in order at least! You'll find mastery insights on a lot of maps (they're grey mastery icons when you have not gone to obtain them) and are unlocked like commune hero points. Some are also from achievements. Another user answered your mount/glider question, so I'll leave it at that!
---
700 karma on dragonfall for me
---
As long as they're unlocked, you can find them in the same location as the other mount hotkeys.
---
If you have not unlocked the corresponding mount, its hotkey will be hidden in the options.
---
Chuka, Astralaria, HOPE and Nevermore do, but they realized it was way too much work to keep doing that for every new legendary.
---
Missed opportunity for your text to say "I am Lamp" -- damnit modrem moth.
---
This is clearly an oversight. Do not abuse this, it'll certainly be patched.
---
What, people should use their head before committing to something ? Who would have guessed.
---
You don't even need to afk for ab you can just show up after the meta and get your free gemstone.
---
Doesn't that literally defy the reason of being a mesmer? Your illusions aren't supposed to have different/distinctive effect.
---
I joined the game today. I'm trying to exchange 2000g with gems. Whenever I try to exchange it says network error and when I try to buy equipment from TP, this message pops up "wait 4 days for validation".
---
Could very easily see golemancer as the next engi spec with a perma pet. Even maybe elementalist after the whole ohmalkhan thing with their effigys. That smelt like an elite spec to me from day one.
---
You can skin over Quip and will still be stat changeable.
---
I don't understand why they put these nodes in the new maps anymore
---
Who in their right mind wastes their ore picks on mithril?
---
They could even be added in your wardrobe with a counter of how many you have. So they would retain their cost for a longer period of time.
---
Eg. You want that specific infusion on 3 characters? Need to have it in your wardrobe three times.
---
Or - you want to stack this shiny infusion 7 times on the same character? Go get the infusion 7 times.
---
Obviously like this it would need to be seen how Wardrobe unlocks would affect this; e.g. only get a random infusion added if you have unlocked everything else?
---
Imagine not understanding the difference between content gated by difficulty and effort, and content gated purely by time
---
tbh, the wolf eats the little red riding hood too
---
Exordium is not pink and purple. And dont know about you but it also fits my guardian and my ranger.
---
I think the combined effect is rly cool but did the base trink have to be an exact copy-paste of Aurora? Jeez.
---
And here I was thinking I was going to start doing that collection lmao
---
Now they only need to let us use mounts in home instances.
---
Hmm, this looks like something that could be part of the coming legendary sigil/runes system.
---
Imagine being so indignant that any content that is slightly difficult that requires cooperation with other people is considered something you can't access. Raids in this game are not hard. It does not take long to learn raids. Even if you play 1 hour a day you can progress in raids. There is absolutely nothing preventing them from releasing two different modes, one so that casuals can access the story, and having a game that is actually playable where you can progress and do something slightly more engaging than the rest of the content where you can literally press 1 on everything and win.
---
...for the new dual-sawed-off-shotgun Warrior elite specialization!
---
Great! Thank you, I didn't look at that page.  
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Options#Control\_Options](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Options#Control_Options)  
---
Was checking there and the other mounts aren't mentioned thus my confusion.
---
Yeah me too same problem. Gonna delete build  template and reinstall again. I hope that works.
---
Cmon guys, it's in the end chairs, mount skins... are just forms of immersion, and the fact that the skyscale chair doesn't match our skyscale breaks that immersion. I don't really need a chair for every mount, but I'd really appreciate if they would let me dye the chair.
---
Bloody red goes so great with the skyscale...
---
Anything better thn current LA
---
You're absolutely right, I've never seen one here in the local stores so I completely forgot about it D:
---
you can buy glyphs with karma?
---
I did that 2 times, hope it works for you tho.
---
&gt;You could've just accurately predicted you were going to need this material that has no other practical application when the game launched in 2013 :)
---
even in comparison to my own post history this is a new level of retardation holy fucking hell
---
Honestly a simple color swap would be nice. Like have it like aurora but blue for example since aurene and shit.   
---
Since I swapped away from mesmer only now am I seeing how a lot of this stuff can hardly be combined xD I'm sure there's a few guardians out there who'd appreciate a blue variant
---
Yes, you have to wait 72 hours before you get the full access. It’s done to prevent gold sellers and bots.
---
No1. Implying I afk often and in a hub city  
---
No2. Implying I'm hovering instead of hanging on something  
---
No3. Implying people didn't afk on mounts before this one?
---
Just use default skin and colour forever x)
---
you HAVE TO WAIT for the 28may build update for ArcDPS, so until that releases, there's no way to fix it.
---
It’s already cold as it is, now will be even more colder!
---
Perhaps these are all just minor components in what will be a far greater legendary..... now to wait till living world season 8
---
And you don't waste food when changing between condi/power/etc as well
---
There's a guide on metabattle about gearing up, there's a lot of ways to acquire ascended gear.
---
funny, true and sad at the same time :/
---
I’ve never tried pvp or wvw yet. More open world roaming. I don’t get as much time to play as I’d like, hence the question. I think I like the idea of being very mobile in combat which leans me more towards the daredevil. But the idea of a 2 handed reaper is very appealing too. Admittedly I boosted the Revenant without trying which was stupid I know. 
---
Thanks for the feedback so far :). I’ll make my decision later today
---
This. I spent 3g last night trying to get the exact copy of that color. it's the default but with better shaders so we can't really replicate it (the grey, pink on wings (and brown of ridges) is more saturated).
---
Oh, they have already been reset, and I've already chosen their stats. But now, after selecting the same stat combo again, these ones have lower stats than my other ascended accessories that were reset.
---
What in tarnation even is this? If anything, that's a UI element, not a character effect.
---
No, as it normally only works for non craftable exotic insignias and inscriptions, so I'm very sure it's the same for this armor.
---
Is.. is this diary entry?
---
Sorry to be a bit offtopic but: u/LordRumpo what configuration do you have on your PC? (Videocard/Proc/RAM)?
---
The video is very smooth so I presume the game runs the same way?
---
Full screen? V-Sync OFF? Details Medium or max? 
---
Thank you in advance.
---
Most likely not as the rule of thumb is you can only salvage inscriptions/insignias which are not craftable.
---
When Aurora came out they said they planned the whole set in advance, so probably? Looks like mesmer clones already get the tier 3 effect for some reason.
---
It makes sense, since accessories can't have skins so they just give you a visual effect based on the number of legendaries equipped.
---
After all was said and done
---
I sat in dragon. It was fun.
---
What is this? I'm away for half a day and miss this. I'm finding no info in game or this subreddit lol.
---
Yeah probably, but I never understood why :/
---
Ah cool - thanks. :) Gutted but I understand.
---
It shouldn't be a fcking mmo then if everything needs to be soloable.
---
Does anybody have sandswept island, domain kourna, etc. timer?
---
This discussion is not that broad as you think it is but about a very particular case of the personal story.
---
IMO the personal story should stay the way that you can play it solo because it is not about playing as a group but about experiencing the story. Arah story path was actually mandatory as a group for a while since release until the community said that this is not a good thing because you will not always be able to find a group and therefore not be able to play or complete the personal story.
---
Fractals, dungeons and raids should contain story but not have a drastic impact on the main storyline.
---
So it is not about being locked out of any story but about the whole "this is my story" part.
---
As a Reaper you are basically immortal in open world, but slow as fck. As a Renegade you burst shit in no time, but you are glassy as hell with no other way of protecting yourself then kill them before they'll kill you. As a DD you are almost immortal, and everything dies just from your looking at you. I play all three, love all of them. Though most time I spend on my DD. Recent change of F1 skill sucks a lot.
---
Are we playing the same game?
---
Steal CAN NOT strip boons.
---
That still doesn't mean that individual items can't at least be recolours. Not everyone wants to craft *all* legendary trinkets, let alone raids in the first place.
---
That's a shame. I hope they fix that as the skin is in our wardrobe and other achieves work this way.
---
But if a shitty move if they don't as it takes quite a chunk of matts/currency
---
Thanks for the routes! I've been farming these using your guides for... way too long... So hopefully I'll get a drop soon^^^^ish now that they've buffed the droprates :)
---

The true heroes of Tyria
---
So I just logged back about a few minutes ago and tried again. No dice - still couldn't craft it.
---
But I did go on another character with max Cooking, popped into Sun's Refuge and asked Gorrik again for the recipe. This time, for some reason, it worked.
---
Hoping this helps someone!
---
Your second question answers your first.
---
I'd say it's pretty much the perfect balance they've stroke this with season where there were 3 sets of weapons with basic/simpler aesthetic that could be upgraded into shinier versions and 2 full set of 3 weights armor that had the same basic/simpler version with an upgradeable shiny one and a 4th set that wasn't shiny and more realistic - the corsair set.
---
I don't get the complaints now.
---
Yeah, my charr horns clip through the wings, and I'm not even mad
---
I've never thought that map switching while mounting would cause this. Nice job on finding the reason for this.
---
Maybe you shouldn't guess when trying to make a point? 
---
It is, everyone started without those masteries after all (heck many of us played before they even existed in the first place), and it is fully possible to play without them. We are getting new people in our guild from WvW relatively often lately, and most of them find it fully possible to play even without those extra buffs.
---
Not dissing the joke, was quite good (~~I laughed~~), but he probably is talking about how, for example, booster's buff doesn't trickle down when offline, only when online so it isn't tied to in-game clock.
---
Healing in t4 is really not required, but I guess if you absolutely wanted to play a support class I'd tell you play harrier tempest, earth water tempest, dagger warhorn, run every shout. Use wh4 on fire and earth off CD to share booons and might, spam the utility shouts for damage reduction/healing/boons. Use elite shout for high pressure moments, and heal shout for situational group burst healing. Fire overload gives a lot of might to squad, and earth overload blinds and gives protection so prioritize those. If you party gets damaged obviously swap to water, the only skill that doesn't heal in some way is dagger 3. Air overload is a good opening skill because of the nice vuln it gives, but unless you are running a more offensive build it won't help you much after the first use, maybe swap to it during phases, so you can precast overload just as the boss is becoming targetable again.
---
Your main cc skills will be, warhorn 4 on air and water, imobs and cripples from earth and the magnetic aura shout. You can swap one of your utilities for icebow for better vuln and a good cc skill on 5. 
---
Your main healing skills outside of water are your shouts, which should be used whenever you have them off CD, so you give people boons through the auras they provide.
---
Before I go I will tell you again, healing is really not necessary in fractals, and some groups in higher tier groups will not take you unless you follow a more meta build, however, this should do fine on your average t4 group, being able to give 25 might, protection, vigor and Regen to 5 people.

As a mesmer main it is one of my part time job lol

PvE is like hanging out at the church where everyone is nice (to your face)
---
PvP is like hanging out at the boxing gym where people stop all the fake friends and being polite.. and start getting real (it’s time limit skills based combat... you good no problems.. you suck.. get good, by practicing!!!)
---
This is like this in ALL games and was way worse or better depending on your perspective in gw1 where it was far far more serious PvP (gw1 pvp = real world prizes even wayyy back in 2006 so shit was very real, very fast, and VERY serious) so if you think gw2 PvP is bad or toxic or in any way “srs bsn”... I got some bridges to sell ya, waterfront view.. beautiful vista’s, the works.

I sometimes refer to my Daredevil as "bouncing ball of death and destruction"

---
The (presumed) effect for the upcoming ring has been "leaked" by mesmer clones [here](/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu8jb8/clones_have_a_different_effect_with_aurora_vision/). Given that this only appears when wearing both Vision and Aurora, and the combined effect of Vision and Aurora appears on clones while only wearing one of them, I think it's safe to assume that the ring will in fact combine with both for this new effect.
---
I just got home from work, what was this?
---
Can anyone link me the build for Chrono to solo fractals? Only tried daredevil and need something new :) Not sure which is the correct build on metabattle. Thx
---
I had a magi backpiece on my druid stay Magi, but the magi backpiece on my scourge reset.
---
They're capable of trimming and shaping those zones to their liking, though; no reason except "we don't want to" for them to not make the bridge area available to mounts.
---
If I remember correctly... Gray dyes are largely the black collection like Abyss, and other stuff. They -are- highly coveted, and because of the rule of cool the price is jacked.
---
However. The Black dyes do not sell well. They are overpriced and currently have a very low demand. Whats more is that dark colors/ off blacks or whites are much easier to get and interacts far better across gear.
---
A true Norn doesn't give Jormag's left testicle about the cold - no, a true Norn revels in the cold! They thrive in it!

My friend is in love with the raven warnhorn lookin' thing. I like how simple the skins are too.
---
I did a double check and even asked for anyone to provide this exact piece of info - and the only news they stated was with the fractals. Never anything about raids. If I'm wrong, I'm still waiting for someone to link this statement from Anet.
---
i'm an Asura, but I visit my Norn friends... need to find a new place I guess.

Wow thats quality tea!

&gt; PvP is like hanging out at the boxing gym where people stop all the fake friends and being polite.. and start getting real (it’s time limit skills based combat... you good no problems.. you suck.. get good, by practicing!!!)
---
Yeah... no.
---
Yep, the most prominent change is that you will receive a bunch of materials instead of a single one per roll like with the last boxes.
---
Then just save those gems or even better gold&gt;gems
---
Agreed. I kinda hope the skyscale matches the appearance of ours given the absolute hell the 'adventure' lead to.
---
wait. Why on earth would Kralk call Glint "mother"? That makes no sense
---
That's looking quite good in my opinion. Of cause some materials will plummit during the event but for own use it is quite decent value. Given that we will receive a couple boxes (between four and six as far as I know) per meta I am quite happy. Will be a busy week for me.
---
This game was never meant nor advertised to be what you want it to be, pointless critique
---
I don't have stuff that old but my TP is still slow
---
Considering them it's taking them almost 2 years to release it, it wouldn't surprise me one bit. Since it will save them fuckload of time and money.

It's evident that these do work though, and if anything we need more of them.

You can usually see the progression of the meta listed among events, basically what is happening in the meta. Example 'Help the outposts upgrade before night falls' (not the exact words, but it's in Verdant Brink), basically tells you current stage of the meta. It should in most cases guide you somewhat on what to do. 
---
Keep in mind, some zones have more than 1 meta events, and the info will change depending on which 'meta zone' you are closer to.

Gw2 is still on DX9, no plans for DX12. Also the game still have both 32-bit and 64-bit clients.
---
The confusion is probably related to a tool called d912pxy which is something recent and not official that basically translate dx9 calls to dx12 calls and can increase performance.
---
oh really now? interesting, maybe that's one of the parts that is causing me issues.
---
Al thought I still can't get the game to run in 32-bit mode, even by downloading the 32-bit launcher it downloads 64 and by adding -32 to the launch parameters it STILL launches in 64
---
Lol no it's a good way to discourage people from even bothering, tbh. It's not even unique, and in order to get the UNIQUE effect you have to have TWO legendary trinkets.  I'm not going to reward their laziness with my in-game effort or gold.
---
This is called culling. they are not being rendered because there are too many in that area which looks like the fire elemental map Boss event.
---
You can go into your settings and set the Character model limit higher. However, you should know that this will impact your FPS negatively and you might end up with a slideshow. Generally I would put Character Model limit and Character model quality to low or lowest. Judging by the screenshot your graphics are already not at the highest so you could be struggling with FPS when you set the character model any higher.
---
that is a good thing to know, thanks for not being a dick about it as well.
---
now I just need to find a way to get it to run in 32, the 32 launcher still installs as 64 and the -32 launch parameters does nothing either.
---
I was having issues with this yesterday on both my own character and various NPC's (specifically Crystal Bloom NPC's in Dragonfall). Invisible textures. Textures incorrectly place it just displaying wrong. I thought it was just my system. Some NPC's didn't even have tops to their head or their face texture was all garbled. It was horrifying.
---
What a hero
---
Hmm, true.
---
I would really like to see a ghillie suit as an outfit (my thief is not a salad, sa[la]dly)...
---
I just thought about the jungle explorer.
---
from my experience:
---
what got reset:
---
- diviner trinkets (3x mist, 2x bitterfrost, 1x siren's landing)
---
- viper trinkets (bitterfrost, lake doric, mist, ...)
---
- commander trinkets (2x bitterfrost)
---
- **bolt**, diviner
---
- caladbolg scepter, viper
---
what didn't get reset:
---
- anything with harrier stats (banners of amnoon, mist)
---
- anything with core stats - specifically: berserker and magi
---
- armor with selectable stats (berserker, commander, viper, harrier)
---
- raid trinkets but I don't think they were supposed to reset anyway
---
TL;DR: only HoT stats were reset (including diviner) for me; no armor was reset
---
not sure how to do that unfortunately, maybe /u/that_shaman might know something about it?
---
Maybe it's a hint at upcoming new hair/facial hair designs.
---
According to the following post they are a random drop from the mystic forge (if you use the new stone) and can also be traded on the tp  - https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu2hld/new_ectoplasmic_stone_research_thread/ep6e351/
---
If there are other ways too, we will see
---
Thing was just 180g for me
---
I... have considered this in the past. It is largely complicated by at least some skins have multiple source items, each with their own recipes, and then recipes have various points where you can choose between purchasing or crafting the subcomponents. In the past this would have blown out the daily update time for the site considerably, but I think I've optimised enough that might be ok now. I'll consider it - probably not in the near future though.
---
Likewise links to gw2efficiency (possibly gw2spidy as well) is a good suggestion, although again the difficulty can be multiple items. Easier to achieve though.
---
so uh... those are from the ectoplasmic forge stones?
---
I don't see any problems with infusions, that's the first thing. Why even change?
---
But I didn't talked to you...
---
I really hope not. I 100% prefer Aurora + Vision over whatever the hell this is.
---
From MF event in LA, which is bugged now.
---
He probably just hasnt ever seen a horse, how would he know for sure what they looked like?!?
---
Some are kill proofs ofc, but most of them I keep until I have enough to craft a golden trophy. 
---
I started with silver for my guild hall, but 9 of each silver trophy would be too much, so now I save them up in my bank instead.
---
LOL It's look like a character in GTA San
---
How do you supply fury like that besides Rebound? Just wondering
---
I also think this is what Aurora + Vision + Coalescence looks like. If I remember correctly the Bounty skill where you slowly charge up with Ley Energy and need to discharge, with a similar animation as this, is called Coalescence.

Good job, Tybalt!

Small tips that will improve your experience on a massive scale: 
---
1. Dont boost a character who's class you havent levelled the classic way at least once
---
2. Play the game step by step, including the personal Story ^(in Orr, pick the seaside assault) 
---
3. Ask on mapchat if you have Questions (f.e. the exotic gear stuff) the community is very helpful 
---
tl;dr: try starting anew, you indeed did scam yourself
---
Skyscale masteries are locked and not available until you unlock the Skyscale. So, no.
---
Yeah,fixed that, shame on me... -.-
---
wtf in what way is he racist?
---
Thank you!
---
This happens to a lot of people who boost their character to level 80 without at least leveling a character to 80 the traditional way.
---
For your thief, I'd recommend sitting down and reading your traits first. Figure out a set up that complements other traits. Read each one. 
---
Once you have that read each of your skills and find ones that complement the traits you selected. 
---
Play around with that build and see what works and doesn't and adjust accordingly. 
---
As for your gear/stats, you'll either go condition damage or power damage. Read each stat next to your character in your Hero panel &gt; Equipment section. Again, try to complement what your traits and skills are. If you feel too weak in one area, adjust your stats to add to that.
---
Once you have a better understanding of your traits, skills and stats start playing with some builds or you can do this in tandem while your learning your stuff.
---
www.metabattle.com has a ton of good builds. Even basic open world builds.
---
Those map currencies you were supposed to get when you were playing on those maps. They are not supposed to be farmed. You want to get a bunch of achievs on those maps as well, anyways...
---
It was zero issue for players that actually spent nonzero time on those maps. It is certainly issue for those, who played the map for 1 day and then logged off for 3 months waiting for next map.
---
The collection is actually good one, above average. It is not meant to be rushed, it is fruit of over year of gameplay.
---
&gt; (75%+ of the player base).
---
Would never unlock Skyscale that is mandatory for new legendary trinket.
---
8,172 of 183,736 (4.448%) on GW2 efficiency have Skyskale. And this part of community tends to be more hardcore...
---
First link, read the category titles, that helps a lot.
---
Both doing great! Less sleep than either of us would like, but that's how things go. Thanks for asking!
---
Thank you to all who do such great things with the Wiki.  You are all very appreciated.
---
&gt; edit: i guess this post is just a rant. I boosted to 80 and maxed the elite specs out using HP trains, so essentially i leveled up in a cheap and game-breaking way. I lost out on the core mechanics and the fun of the game and that sucks. 
---
Nobody stops you from playing through the story from start to end. It's now just a little bit (VERY) unchallanging.
---
Maybe replay the leveling zones with a new toon while you dip your toes into the expac stories and early fractals with one of your boosted dudes. Boosting in general isnt too smart for beginners. You will get lost in the amount of content that hits you if you dont have a veteran holding your hand for a while. You can always ask in map chat but that also gets you this far. Take it easy and try to discover things one by one. Dont try everything at once.
---
The dragons blood ones aren't progressive either. You only need go make one dragsonblood weapon to be able to buy any of the heroic recipes
---
According to the following post they are, yes - https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu2hld/new_ectoplasmic_stone_research_thread/ep6e351/

if they are smart and competent, they can implement both solutions, pal :)
---
I tried to pick up the site some time ago, good mix-matches actually get downvoted vs white/black/particlefests, people photoshop their stuff then flame when called out about it, you'd actually get downvoted for criticizing others' outfits with no real explanation, some armor combos are actually good but the amount of self-entitlement is real, good styles would get buried while stuff with 3-4 pieces of the same set gets gold. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Also stuff that has nothing to do with what's ingame (silly styles) get more votes...
---
People outright ignore the site's guidelines.
---
It's at a point where you think "everyone should have a voice... not a way".
---
Anyway, I've never really seen a Mix-match guild or something like that though I'd enjoy being part of one so, maybe make one? Or let's just add each other? I'm sure you'll find some of my mixmatches very interesting. (Rfreak.6591)
---
Sometimes I park one of my characters close to a bank and see people actively stopping, that just makes you feel all warm and fuzzy.
---
Also, could we get a subreddit where we post our stuff, no frills required? I think Anthem's subreddit's a good guideline about how we'd want to display our styles.

This has to be a bug.

You are not alone with the problem of "I boosted a character and now I don't know what I should do".
---
You basically joined the tour de france as someone who just got a bike for Christmas, obviously you will not be able to compete with other players who have the experience in the game because GW2 is more about the knowledge about the game and your profession.
---
Just because you boosted doesn't mean you are at the end of the world. Create a new character and start the game from the beginning, you can always use the other character when you know the game again.
---
&gt;  But i feel like im fucked endgame now, because I have no idea what to do. I'm lost when it comes to raids, I get owned in pvp, and I dont know what fractals are or how to get exotic gear
---
Don't worry, you'd still have no clue about any of that even if you leveled up 50000 characters yourself, because absolutely none of this matters below level 80.   
---
Don't drink the "LeVeLuPyOuRsElF" kool aid that the other commenters generously suggest, it's a waste of time. Go read the wiki instead. Heck, if you have any questions at all, google/wiki are your friends while Reddit is definitely not. You want objective information, not opinions.
---
I love the idea itself, it's a nice way to show off a legendary level without creating *too* much visual clutter. But at the same time, I am very disappointed, because I really dislike Aurora's effect (and the combined effect, since it just builds on it). I would've made Vision if it was different and better looking. This way, I won't bother with either of them.
---
Check out ViP if you see the tag around. 2000+ members across 5 guilds. I joined their HP train one day when i was leveling and then joined the guild. They run weekly HP and MP trains. Everyone is super helpful.
---
Vengeance in Power is the guild im in but they have others.
---
I suggest looking for a big active guild that does events.
---
That's unfortunate but I don't see how that's relevant to either my question or the situation OP reported?
---
I personally prefer W6 to W5. Personally preference I guess.
---
You say that as if the story is challenging when "level-appropriate", however level-appropriate it can possibly be after having been butchered several times in a row with changes to level requriements and progression.
---
Yup that's it ty.

According to the Damage Calculation page on the GW2 Wiki, kits use their own weapon strength midpoint based on the rarity of the weapon you're using in the main hand (for example, exotic or ascended). As far as attacking with the grenades for damage the only thing that'll factor between a 2h weapon or two 1h ones would be like Gulbasaur said, the stat differences (a stat difference of about 1 point I believe).
---
As for other things, like your toolbelt skills, those scale off what's in your main hand (so you used double pistols, it'd only take the weapon strength from the one in the main hand).
---
It'd arguably be safer to use a rifle if you wanted more damage but it shouldn't really affect much if you didn't as long as your highest tier weapon is in the main hand slot.
---
If your doing any sort of farming  on the character where you have to tag mobs while running, like mad kings lab daredevil  is amazing, with like permanent swiftness  and short bow 5 skill and auto attacks that bounce I usually  use my dd to farm stuff like that
---
&gt; Alright, and how many of those suggestions could just magically be added?
---
And who is asking for "magically added" features or content?   
---
Anet could start with acknowledging WvW as a fully fledged play mode and build a dedicated team to support and develop it.  
---
There is also a fine line between "magically added perfect balance" and "imbalance so gross that the meta remains stale for **years** on end and many if not most playstyles are downright worthless, unacceptable, and not viable". The world is not black and white. It's not necessary that they would release perfect balance patches every week that would overhaul everything. But when a rigid meta remains the same for years on end, that's simply unacceptable. 
---
&gt; Removing links and merge servers will for example shit on people who prefer playing on smaller servers without massive map-blobs everywhere.
---
You just need to answer one question. What is the core idea of WvW?   
---
No really, is the core idea of your MASSIVE PVP mode to have empty maps with tiny ass fights? Why have it in game at all? The same can be achieved in sPVP easily.   
---
I've touched upon it in other comments, but anet need to clarify the vision they have for their game modes, communicate it clearly, and then act on it. "Try to attract everybody and their mom to milk the sweet $$$" is not a vision. Abandoning the mode almost entirely is not a vision.   
---
&gt; Balance is being done, over and over and over again.
---
Yet where is the result? Why do the "balance" patches only intensify the imbalance as a result? Why do they fail to acknowledge some core issues that permeate the GW2 core combat like abundance of unique effects like stability, stunbreaks, area CC, and projectile reflection? The tiny range of team buffs enforcing blob meta? Low target caps on AOE skills working towards the same goal? Tiny maps with lacking differentiation of objective types?
---
Or a (placeholder) 4th?
---
After all if, tire 1 effect + clone = tier 2 effect, it could be that the clone is doubling the effect parameter somehow.
---
So if 3 trinkets form tier 3 and 4 trinkets form tier 4, then:
---
Aurora + Vision + clone = tier 2 + tier 2 = tier 4.
---
He doesn't &amp; cannot unless he brings air.
---
Heal ele has among the strongest heals in the game too( making them extremely overkill), so its not like he would loose anything buy dropping water for it unless there is something doing a ton of condition damage in which case he should drop earth.
---
Hmm I fed after the patch yesterday but I don't have this, and it still says I need to wait....
---
Is it really necessary to go so far with such comments because of an image used on a tool that is supposed to help people in a game?
---
How odd.
---
Well it's been [updated now](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/x64/)
---
Getting downvoted for supporting the game.
---
This subreddit never ceases to amaze me.
---
Take a minute and goto metabattle  or snow crows and look up builds for what you want to play there's usually  a  bit of a summary  explaining what the goals of the build are and how to play them, these are usually  well thought out to synergize  with your other traits to make it a really great build that other people  have usually  done the math on, next you can go back and do your personal  story, while its definitely  aged content  and not as good as heart of thorns or path of fire stuff it will help you get meshed into how your new build works in an environment  that's not going to RIP you apart, if you jump right into heart of thorns you probably  will get smacked just because  the open world map content on that expansion was made to be more challenging and in fact probably  is more unforgiving  than  the new expansion  path of fire difficulty wise. You really  need to  understand  how the build you play works before  hopping  into pvp or you'll get farmed by people

Lmbo did i make the image? Did i say the tool isnt useful? What i said is FACT. You are uptight because i called it out? HOW DARE HE POINT OUT A RACIALLY INSENSITIVE IMAGE!!! lmbo pathetic. Reddit is pathetic.... I didnt attack OPs character. I said the image used is racist and a lot of people would find it untasteful... A mexican guy with a sombrero and mustache next to a taco. I get the taco being there with the overlay called Taco, but why is the mexican caricature there? Please enlighten me? Oh because mexicans eat tacos right?
---
It's because of all those mithril ingots.  
---
Miller was right!
---
Well at least 75+
---
Just to mention, befor ppl throw out money for nothing.
---
mirage and the chrono build youre referring to fill completely differend roles.  
---
the chrono build is a support build, pumping out boons.  
---
the mirage build is a dps build, purely focussing on dmg.  
---
since its a condi build, its not that effective in fractal, so experienced groups wont accept that.  
---
but they are some LFGs up every day that take everyone, so you will be able to find a group, but it might take some time on some days.
---
I have so many birthday boosters.. the only bad part is back when I was leveling on EOTM you weren't getting any waypoints. 
---
Now I just have so many experience tomes I can probably level up 5 or so characters to max.
---
this is such a laughable inaccurate generalisation. sure there are trolls and dickheads, maybe even more than there are in PvE. yet somehow people do not get as easily offended in PvE, and at the same time forget how easy systems like teamchat make it for said trolls to create an audience. then there is the issue of toxic casuals which /u/Lovaa already dived into.
---
if you ever stepped into a squad's voice room, you'd know that most people are pretty damn relaxed and crack jokes all the time unless they're mid-fight, and don't care at all about what idiots from both sides throw at each other, only siphoning chat for scout messages. and these people are the ones that ultimately suffer due to people's ridiculous rumours about the mode based on some black sheep, and parrots like you that spread them as if they were fact.
---
So sad.
---
Account bound currencies' main function is to make sure that you complete and participate in a certain amount of specific content, which rewards the currency.
---
This populates maps.
---
And if they add new choices of rewards you can exchange for the currency, it makes playing those maps more appealing to players.
---
Yeah, seems that way for all of the mounts, but I've been able to get relatively close for all of them except for the Springer and Rollerbeetle.
---
They spoil every story in every living season patch notes, it's nothing new and nothing unexpected.
---
So we know how Aurora + Vision + Coalescence will probably look like...

\[Exclusive preview of the 5 combined legendary trinkets effect\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuyJNIoCBRw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuyJNIoCBRw))
---
Mirage is borderline useless in T1/2 - any condi class is - and might improve in T3, and becomes pretty decent starting at T4. You don't have any burst, but if you know how to play mirage, you will frequently be the highest damage against bosses, partly because you don't have to interrupt your rotation to avoid mechanics.
---
Chrono in fractals is usually support. DPS chrono is a different build, and so is mirage. I'd actually suggest playing a burst power class until you reach T4, and I say this as a mirage player. Stuff at T1/2 just doesn't have the health to let you ramp up your damage.
---
Imagine crying about being incentivized to play the game that you play.
---
It’d be the item code that changed if they don’t stack with each other.  The name can be exactly the same.
---
8-bit quality, maybe.
---
your ankles have been out there for years? don't you miss it?
---
Definitely an improvement.
---
So u got 6 precursors from how many tries?
---
Didnt play during lws1 huh?
---
Have been farming in bitterfrost frontier and got lots of bloodstone dust from the frozen chests there.
---
So the raid ring will give you a piece of flying shit over your head?
---
Grow lamp price is really minimal when you have charged quartz crystals though. You won't even be able to craft it without playing a bit of dry top. Drytop gives lots of quartz crystals btw and one of the story instance achievement also gives 5 of them. It rewards for long term players yes. But new players won't expect everything to be available on day 1.
---
Look at griffon, people know that flying on griffon feels great but it's luxury. They won't have even close to enough gold only by playing story. They have to focus on side content on the way to achieve it. In griffons case it's raw gold of 250. Similarly in you won't get skyscape just by playing the story alone, you need do side stuff in this case it's map currency
---
You might be right there. I got dawn from 5 attempts with the new stone and impalers....
---
hmm? they disabled it?
---
im using the -32 flag and its still a 32 bit client for me as far as i can see it...
---
I think the difference is now, we have so many big events that you have at least something to do at any time. Actually, there are so many events that you can't possibly hit them all, because there is always overlap.
---
a little tip: there are very cheap food and nourishments on the TP for just a few copper. when you use both all the time they give 20% experience bonus. (10 each)
---
Ow... just realize I lost 1 :(
---
I like the new effect and I'd rather not see it changed.
---
There -- a comment praising the decision, which you will promptly ignore, like you've done with all of the other ones.
---
This fits the TIFU subreddit perfectly
---
I am so unbelievably excited about these new skins. I hope ANet hears everyone's praise and starts to focus more on these unique-but-not-excessive skins. This is the sweet spot, right here.
---
Not all capes wear heroes
---
Anyone want to clue me in as to why "[The Streamer](https://i.imgur.com/nfZsU22.jpg)" I don't even know or care about should have special privileges by having people hold events for them?
---
The feeding achievement now takes 3 days rather than 4 days.
---
The charged quartz crystals may take time, but they do not cost gold and are not even tradeable. 
---
Even if you just wanted to buy it from the TP, it's only another 25 gold. Is 75 Gold a lot for some newer players? Yes, it is. It's still nowhere near the Griffon, though, and that was your original comment.
---
you need the Gw2.exe and not the Gw2-64.exe as far as i can tell for the flag. idk if its still on anets website otherwise i could upload mine somewhere.
---
Well now its already released so they are not going to change it because that would upset people who spent time to get it. Same as every other time people are whining about a skin.
---
Definitely better than when an object or invisible creature has no name and it just shows an empty space.
---
The problem with any condi playstyle is that they have a long starting time than the direct damage playstyle. You need longer to get to your max damage than other playstyles and depending on the boss fight and their phases like they are cleansing, transferring or even are invulnerable to conditions you lose a lot of damage that you have to ramp up again each time that happens. On the other hand your conditions ignore toughness but that is not that much that this would make a difference.
---
I played Condi necro/reaper/scourge for a long time in fractals but this was purely casual and not something hardcore. I also beat all of the Challenge motes with semi organized groups and still didn't lack behind in damage.
---
You can play what you want in fractals as long as you find like minded people, even in T4. Not every playstyle might fit into a speedrun group. From my experience I have cleared T4 fractals daily faster than some trying to get an organized group together.
---
If you can get decent damage out of your build, not the optimal raid benchmarks, but decent damage and know how the fractal is played you won't have many problems.
---
Which is how I feel about Dragonfall.
---
Which exotics are the cheapest? I have never gotten a precursor from any drop before. Which ones are you using with the stone?
---
or no because you have 30 completely equipped chars
---
Finally got hounds on the timer too.  Idk why it didn't get it's own bar in the first place but hopefully it gets people into the forge.
---
I'm gonna say no on that theory too. I have three Black Ice Earrings in my bank, in the same bank tab. Two were selected as Assassin, and the third was Dire. After the update, one Assassin reset, as well as the Dire one, but the other Assassin one is still Assassin.
---
Never mind that my ranger's equipped Caladbolg Orchida was Berserker, and it got reset. But it was the only piece of equipped gear that got reset on my account.
---
using the new stone or the old mystic forge stone?  I had crap luck with the new one.
---
Its gw2. It trains its players to become mindless and borderline idiots. If they arent the players get bored pretty quickly. Natural selection favouring those who are terrible at games.
---
OP, curious if you donated mithril to the forge during the event?
---
It's got nodes which you mine bloodstone dust from with a chance of blood rubies, if you found yourself lacking it's easy to gather there.
---
Looks awesome.
---
50 mystic ecto stones later - 2 rare weapons from this patch. Thats it, nothing else.
---
at the moment I don't have very precise results
---
but I can tell you that depending on how much you pay for the ecto and the weapons, the price of the infusion changes
---
example:
---
Ecto 15 silver Weapons 90 silver = infusion cost 6357 gold = Must Sell for 7479 gold for go to the par
---
Ecto 17 silver Weapons 100 silver = infusion cost 7957 gold = Must Sell for 9360 gold for go to the par
---
Ecto 17 silver Weapons 110 silver = infusion cost 8587 gold = Must Sell for 10066 gold for go to the par
---
F
---
I think the whole hero panel is a coding mess from what I've heard.
---
Nope cause it was apparently bugged
---
It's the same with any pick as far as i know, you can get 3 also with top tier tools, there is a chance to get one on any strike, not 1 per node.
---
I think the ones that feel the worst are ones you don't  have power over when they start. When you're unsure when something starts it makes it hard to run it. But if you have control over the start (ala Silverwastes and Dragonfall) or theres a timer (all of HoT) its a good fit. A nice mix of both is what is needed versus just a single method
---
And the game seems to thrive because of it.
---
Just because you personally think raids are brainless doesn't mean it is the same situation for other players as well.
---
Can confirm, they are. But not all of them are in the game (turais shield is missing e.g.)
---
Haven't bought yet. Wanted to reach higher level. But I'll look into the candy thingy. Thanks!
---
Halloween food is dirt cheap and gives a 15% boost to experience from kills instead of the usual 10%. I used it a lot on my alt account when I was leveling up characters and didn't have access to stockpiled tomes. It's good value.
---
Speaking as someone who is solidly liberal both socially and politically:   
---
Please stop.  And go away.
---
&gt; No, mmos were always very broad and appealing to a market as large as possible.
---
This is simply not true for early (pre-2004) MMOs simply because the potential demographic for MMOs in those years was limited and subject to a variety of filters.   
---
On top of that, while games like UO or EQ could feasibly be considered "prototype AAA games" in regards to their market positioning, there also were games like PS or DAOC that had one core gameplay mode and were only pushing that.   
---
&gt; Mmos lost a huge part of their market share by not modernizing along with other games. League is competitive for new to professional players.
---
&gt; The majority are p2w or grind2win with or without RNG  
---
I'm not sure that the type of modernization you suggest is possible while retaining core MMORPG gameplay and values. For instance, LoL is easily accessible and competitive for a range of players because it has little to no elements of grind and leveling up, while grind for direct character power in one way or another (gear, levels, stats and so on) is one of the core aspects of the MMO genre.   
---
&gt; Gw2 lacked basic competitive systems like matchmaking and leaderboards
---
Yes, this is another reason why it failed as a competitive PVP game. That said, WOW does have competitive systems in PVP like matchmaking and leaderboards and it's not helping terribly much.   
---
&gt; Gw2 wvw has no competition and it's the only game the gamemode survived its neglect this long.
---
Yes, but there is no need to force the same types of competition on mass pvp game modes as on instanced arena pvp game modes due to all of the differences.   
---
Instead, things like faction or guild pride/competition could be ingrained in the game design, but this is not the case in GW2, obviously, and it's not clear about how they could feasibly introduce such.
---
Hey eshmoon,
---
I'll give you the best truthful advice I can. Despite your guild, friends and server and the potential of the game, you should quit. Sooner rather than later, your guildies and friends will do the same. Play other games with them if you like.
---
Play one a month or for a week after a realise, until you realise even that isnt worthwhile. Anet gives no fucks about wvw, or anything else. They're just milking money where possible. Despite Ben and raymond, wvw updates and improvements wont hit the mark when they come 5 years too late.
---
At this stage I'd have more hope for a private server than anything anet and the remaining community produce. A sad reality can be quite real nonetheless.
---
How many forges did you do?
---
Oh you can have 2 different. I have only been using one of them. Thanks! Just gotta make sure I have space in the bags. Fills up quick
---
If you're naked..sure. Only slightly outlines the skin. Def not worth the money honestly.
---
Well..I'm about to grind your gear even harder.
---
Check under hid neck, its basically paper thin and literally attached to the body.
---
Ayyy the legend himself!
---
Did you read the fanfic in the epilogue instance?
---
(I mean, i think it was a follow up on the jahai bluff ones, might be wrong)
---
You get it at a very low random chance by combining 3 rare or exotic level 76+ weapons with the new ectoplasmic stone in the Mystic Forge.
---
I used the 45 or 46 mystic forge stones that were occupying my bank for the last 3 years.
---
After that, I tried the new ecto stones (10) and then I stopped.
---
Those are probably unicorns.
---
Pvp and other modern games nowadays still  market themselves one way or another. That's part of capitalism and perfectly fine. Regardless mmos were plenty with pvp, pve, exploring, crafting, economies and a wide range of activities aiming at a wide range of different players. Unlike gw2 at this stage, because the game must be for casuals.
---
Gw2 was modern and has no grind or p2w for pvp. In general its grind for bis is very low. Grinding wasnt really a thing on release. took me 2-3 weeks for max level and BiS gear, less than it took for lvl30 and 1 bis runeset in lol. So honestly that isnt the issue.
---
Gw2 refused to make a skill based ladder for 4yr + to avoid telling bad players they're bad. You could freely swap team or leave losing games for years. So pvp was doomed because while they avoided grind, they refused to do basics for competition. Wvw struggles for the sane issues.
---
Gw2 wvw has design flaws that make competition impossible. See transfers, no rewards for good gameplay or effort, identical rewards for low effort leeching which effectively griefs your team, ... and as the game progresses these are PROMOTED by casual players who think its in their favour. Yet they still wont play because they're carebears that inherently hate competition.
---
Wow is an OLD game with a very non fluent combat system. Still wow pvp and wow at it's time was huge. Nowadays wow doesn't innovate. Churns out mediocre content to milk its nostalgic players. Same for the rest of this genre.
---
Perfect:-)
---
useless af..
---
How many precursors did you get then?
---
Can you combine it with polysaturating infusion? I'm wondering because mystic outlines body and polysaturating outlines armor and hair only.
---
did it start again?
---
or was that a one time thing?
---
The collection was fine and really wasn't that bad. Now that it's every 2 hours I feel it's much more in line with where it should be as well. I had almost 0 currency from each map, except Dragonfall since it kinda tossed stacks of that stuff into my lap. Overall it took me 2 days of very casual gathering to stack out on all the LS4 currency. If it's a problem to play the game for 1-2 days to gather those materials then maybe you should just drop it.   
---
People always seemed to forget that the Skyscale isn't a must have thing. Your Mastery Level doesn't HAVE to be maxed. You don't HAVE to unlock every single mount. Yes, I get it, I'm a collectionist too, I did it solely just to have to have it, but I enjoyed the journey and the gameplay it provided along the way. I couldn't imagine doing all that if I disliked the game enough to bitch about gathering some (very easy to get) materials.. I mean i get it, it was something i groaned about at first, but after doing some runs, hearts, events, ect.. I found that it was super easy and actually fun to replay the maps while they were repopulated
---
Nope. Still disabled while they fix it.
---
Cool thanks!!!
---
We've definitely had an issue like this before on another similar achievement.
---
Some people haven't been keeping their charged quartz stocked.
---
If I remember correctly he explains only his encounter with Balthazar but I was more so talking about an explanation of exactly how he became a revenant. He also gives a vague summary what he can do as a revenant in HoT but still never explained how learned how to do it, or moreover who taught him, if that was the case.
---
How to get it?
---
God i want a paragon spec for ranger so badly. one of my favorite things in GW1 was to play random arenas as a spear ranger
---
&gt; Gw2 refused to make a skill based ladder for 4yr + to avoid telling bad players they're bad
---
Same reason why they don't want to implement proper combat logging and DPS meters. That's exactly the issue here - you can have either one or the other, not both. If you want to pander to casuals, well, no problems - but then it's logical that the more hardcore/competitive systems suffer and players from that demographics aren't that interested, or at all.   
---
Ironically, you can still service both audiences (except for extreme casuals who cannot stand any kind of competitive mechanics) by having a skill-based ladder matchmaking, but not with the opposite.   
---
&gt;  Nowadays wow doesn't innovate.
---
Sure, WOW is nothing to write home about in the recent years. MOP was the pinnacle of WOW, and, coincidentally, the end of major system overhauls/innovation.
---
So you are OP vs cripple. Anet nerf this shit already /s
---
I made this exact same mistake when HoT just released, RIP my gold and free time
---
As punishment for being ugly on charr, I transmuted it and put it on my necromancer
---
They don't even need to "fix" it for me to enjoy it, they just need to let us toggle on/off specific features of a legendary, such as the arm sleeves
---
No, they raise the population for a good while longer than that, unless you're maybe on a dead server.
---
Personally play on Piken Square and queues do go up the following weeks after events, and not to talk about updates, when the pip system came it was packed, when the warclaw came it was packed.
---
You literally play on a dead server, or you have no clue what you're talking about and you just like to shit talk the gamemode.
---
mine is insanely slow but only since the last week or so i think, maybe 2
---
This is much more time consuming than the griffon :S FUCKING ANNOYING !
---
people complained the griffon was expensive as if 250g is a lot of gold.
---
Now, we get this piece of shit with time gates all over the mfucking place !
---
I HOPE YOU FUCKERS ARE HAPPY NOW !!!!
---
What size bags are you running?
---
Now that’s the real Ecto Gamble
---
Or N Commanders And N Catmanders
---
Oh yeah, forgot to change it. I'll think of something.
---
Wait, how do you Continuum Shift without returning to your original location? To move faster than Thief
---
Yep that's my experience as well, have been playing a Reaper since returning to the game and I'm just insanely unkillable while still being able to easily mow just about anything down fairly quickly. Wish there were other profs that compared because I like switching between profs for variety but I actually hesitate to use my alts now since none of them feel as powerful as the Necro.
---
So you‘re whining because there‘s items and mounts that actually take time and effort? If you don‘t want to do it, don‘t do it. Some of us actually enjoyed the new collection.
---
Anyone got like a gallery ?
---
It will. Tons of people ran it last night.
---
You cant use mimic and continuum split anymore
---
I rolled in the mystic forge 40 times with ecto stones and 93 times with normal stones, 0 pres. Just saying its all RNG still guys ;)

You can still use it to spam a lot of alacrity to reload.

There are dozens of us!

If you equip the mirage specialisation and equip a sword you will be faster then a thief I think. But with mounts this isnt really necassary
---
Waiting for a gw2 private server that isnt bound by anet or the most carebear and deluded gaming population I've seen. The game had potential, too bad.
---
Personally idc about open world, but all they have to do is give part participation rewards and part rewards based on contribution by you or your group. Then make some more difficult events with better loot, too. Then you create healthy incentives for, idk, playing the game.
---
???? Like idk half the games on the market. 
---
Imagine you're a company and you spend resources to develop your game. Then again you can also just ban discussion about wvw matches entirely, ignore all of it and pretend it doesn't exist, while still spending money on hundreds of developers and artists. Decisions decisions.
---
Can be in places where you either can't mount or where you spend most of your time in combat unable to mount for that reason...
---
Great guide, thank you! One small correction:
---
&gt; The achievements are some world bosses, the events for the cathedrals in Orr and a bunch of events in Kourna. 
---
You don't need the service medal achievements for this; those are only mandatory for the ascended version of the banner. For the Kourna Vision collection, you only need to have crafted the base exotic version of the banner.
---
It's disabled right now because the event didn't end properly (so people left and didn't get a reward because they thought "that's it")
---
Quite the contrary, i do. And its an issue that i am denunciating for a long time now. But while you are right that WvW has a moderate climate in comparison, that doesn't make it good. I don't even get why this is an issue in the first place, because its all human beings interacting with each other - but i sure am naive for thinking why this interaction should be any different online or not.

What does this mystic infusion look like?
---
Absolutely bankrupted me, got nothing in return.
---
Show us what it looks like!
---
New season.
---
Guardians (specifically Dragon Hunters DH) are pretty good at gathering. Aegis to take hits and remain out of combat (OOC) while harvesting nodes is great. DH F3 specifically blocks all attacks for a 3 second period helping remain OOC. Granted Thiefs could be considered better with stealth, but just slap a Superior Rune of the Trapper on your DH and you have stealth and blocks.
---
What if it's a different stage 2 depending on which combo of trinkets
---
Ty ty
---
Need to see this with Ritualist outfit dyed similarity.
---
Just buy them on the TP only 10k gold. Kappa
---
I use a fiery outfit on my reaper. It almost feels like I'm the firelight emerging from the darkness, giving it a more hopeful and happy theme. That's the only idea I got though lol
---
LOL ... not doubting this one person's rng/luck, but it would be a great post to get silly people to buy up all the exotic weapons and people will be cashing in on this.
---
Idk I’d enjoy a donating to “science” reference, personally
---
Pls pack your stuff and leave the Internet alltogether with your uberpoliticalcorrect bullsh**... Holy moly ppl these days are strange
---
whats this?
---
What are the stats on the gear you're using? For pure damage builds you want power, precision and ferocity. For condition builds you want condition damage, expertise.
---
Half your build is to have synergy between your weapons and the stats on your gear. For longbow you want power gear, for instance.
---
Also your build can be optimized by picking the right traits :)
---
Are we sure that's the right rift? Every correct one has an indicator over it, but that one doesn't.
---
I'm using berserkers currently. I am currently crafting my ascended gear but haven't chosen which stats I want yet.
---
Oh but is it planned to return or was it just a one time thing?
---
Were it trade-able ask anyone and they'd dump like 17 stacks on you. Geeze the stuff piles up.
---
The best change I can recommend is to switch to a build that uses Greatsword instead of Longbow. Longbow is great in PvP, but terrible at PvE (unless you need to break the range limit and pew pew something from a thousand miles away, ofc).
---
 [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast\_-\_Power\_DPS](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Power_DPS) 
---
Here's a build example from metabattle that uses Greatsword + Sword/Axe and is specifically geared towards fractals. As with any build suggestion, you should consider your own play style and try to learn why the build works so that you can make adjustments as needed. But don't let others put down the idea of following a pre-defined build like this - they're a great foundation and can help get you on the right track.
---
This particular build is essentially the same as their raid build, and I use it in fractals, raids, open world, dungeons, etc. Very solid and enjoyable once you get the hang of it\^\^
---
tbd?
---
Good job putting spoilers in your title!!
---
I hope the right people see this, but THANK YOU SO MUCH for these weapons!! Its so refreshing to see weapons that look like they belong in this world, and not the constant rainbow glitter vomit we often get.
---
Looks like it’ll be good on any fashion that doesn’t have a lot of armor. So good for all the skimpy looks. Not worth the prices it’s going for now tho.
---
Love the core before you love the spec? I created 3 guardians in gw2 that I ended up deleting, because core and DH feel exactly the same, and I don't like that playstyle. I absolutely love every kind of firebrand though. It's completely different.
---
Glints plan will only be realised when elder dragons of old are gone. Primordus and Jormag going back to sleep is temporary measure (and lame story from player perspective). Tyria is not safe.
---
The "happy ending" we got season finale is not justified by what was established before and cements the rumours that it was supposed to be conclusion of the game. Thank god for ncsoft so stop anet madness.
---
What do I suggest next? Well, hiring competent writers sounds like good start.
---
We have had armors and weapons full of flames from the very beginning. And for a while, that was the only effect they added to any armor or weapon. Breaking immersion was always easy.
---
And those yoga pants are from launch.
---
Will probably return soonish, it's promo for the new raid (coming in june)
---
Any chance you are playing a new larger character?
---
Sand Swell. In wvw necroes spam these so siege golems can go faster   by using it. 900 range near instantly created portal, that lets you go back and forth, refreshing the barrier it applies each time.
---
Given the leaks we now sadly know that Arenanet was planning for this to be the last episode before the company was able to restructure
---
The fractal team is basically dead after the two leads left or were fired, and i also think raids after this next wing will be heavily delayed
---
I love this game but it will slowly die, the parent company NCSoft has basically given up hope and now Arenanet is going to ride things out with minimal effort and resources 
---
No funding for expansions, no more fractals, raids will probably be once a year or less and a delayed living world season will be the only thing left until Arenanet decides to pull the plug
---
I hate aurora but like the improved effect.
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
You can avoid doing the rifts twice by opening the rifts, afking nearby for ~2 minutes, then opening the rift again. That will give you the buff you need. (It seems like you only get the buff after the rift has spawned all the VM.)
---
We go to cantha to fight the water dragon after a tsunami forces them to ask elona for help and elona call on the commander
---
What’s the best way to get dividers accessories, do any of the living world stories give selectable stat accessories that contain the diviner stat?
---
Condi dps in Fractal is mediocre at best. Anything is viable if you don't care about pushing for faster clears, etc. The meta for T4s is all power.
---
What process did you do to get these?
---
/sign  
---
This would be awesome, my friends and I were saying yesterday we'd buy the chair if it updated with dye and skins.
---
Well duh.
---
The worst was kung fu tea. Skyscale is only bad. Bad design is common thing in gw2 :)
---
Nope. That's how we get it as far as we know for now.
---
&gt; DH F3 specifically blocks all attacks for a 3 second period 
---
More specifically, all attacks from the front.

---
Wing 7 is confirmed the last wing to come out.
---
After doing 52 rolls wasting 1300 ecto and 100g+ on exotics THIS IS NOT WORTH WHILE!!!! DO NOT DO THIS!!!!
---
Theoretically, with the patch yesterday, all stat selectable accessories should have diviner's as an selectable option now.
---
&gt; NUMBER OF NEW WEAPONS
---
New weapons?
---
Yeah, I know, and I think this isn't a big deal. It all combines for a greater look. I agree with it. It (should) make people want to make all the trinkets to gain something awesome looking. Its progress. I see both sides, honestly, but I can appreciate what they are trying to do. I just get the feeling people are thinking Anet is being lazy.
---
That's a huge amount of ectos for an infusion that gets hidden by The armor
---
You are not getting extras. You are just losing the other materials.
---
Nodes can already give 0-3.
---
I'll invert the question: why should they?
---
What does it mean by new weapons?  Are they new skins?
---
Been like that for weeks/months. Nothing new.
---
Is this your first time using the mystic toilet?
---
I've tried all of them and I like Reaper and DD. I never got into Renegade and prefer herald. The only thing is that Reaper and DD are very melee-focused and Renegade/Herald can at least do decent damage and feel fun to play at range.
---
Well, to get feedback from the players maybe ? About what they are planning to do.
---
Between [gobblers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Converter) and crafting/selling [ley-line infused tools](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ley-Line_Infused_Tool), I'm able to keep my surplus under control.
---
Can'tkles.
---
Depends on your luck, but yes.
---
I laughed way too much.
---
I’m a brand new F2P player. 
---
Where exactly do you get these bags?
---
But then people will be focusing on future builds and don't bother playing the current way.
---
They release changes, people play and give feedback, they change what they think they should and release it. It works. It's a cycle. The goal is never to reach a perfect balance, it's to shake things up constantly, that only works with the element of surprise.
---
Why are human female metas obsessed with that scarf, chaos gloves I understand, but that massive scarf is a mystery to me.
---
Yeah.
---
200 try with normal mystic forge stone =
---
0 precursor
---
0 new weapons
---
0 infusion
---
Very underwhelming. They should fix it to be wayyy nicer. Its just a blue-ish Polysaturating infusion.
---
Yeah I believe that_shaman has a post with the new weapons names, they are pretty generic overall but some a decent.
---
&gt; 52 rolls
---
https://i.imgur.com/RtwtKB1h.jpg
---
No but that doesn't mean I can warn others who get swept up in the this buzz where Anet is just trying to make us sink our ectos with gambling like I did. If I can stop some people from going bankrupt like I did then I'm happy.
---
The rich ones get richer..
---
*Last Train Home plays in the background*
---
Leaks? They themselves said ls5 was a last minute decision.
---
Why do the devs not do something they often do?
---
during me: still not a single pre playing 1000mio hours since first beta. and im sure the first pre i will find will be an underwater pre worth 60 gold...
---
Because they also don’t need to listen to everything players say need changing. For one, usually only a vocal minority will complain, and they won’t have the big picture like devs do.
---
Yeah, well, I used to sell ley-line infused tools all the time. Crafted about 10 of those and sold them the day the skyscale released, before anyone knew we'd need charged quartz.
---
Needless to say, I don't do that anymore.
---
Sold by the vendors, you might need to do the "complete enough events in the different map areas" achievements, but those will get done naturally as you earn the zone currency.
---
The currency is pretty plentiful, too, so you can earn the items pretty quickly similar to Bitterfrost, except you get to actually have fun playing the game instead of mindlessly gathering from nodes.
---
another mesmer nerf? :)
---
There's a bunch of them like Falchion etc. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bucjsb/this_was_one_of_the_best_updates_of_the_year/?st=JW9974RW&amp;sh=88033fb7
---
I've talked to multiple devs and they all say the same thing: "Because most of our playerbase can't form coherent sentences with proper spelling and grammar."
---
Seriously though. 1. They have recently. Post-layoffs they did a post going over the changes. But 2. They don't need to/gain anything from it. They're not going to undo a change based on community feedback because most of the time the community is shit when it comes to understanding balance (except scrapper when they first re-did it). All these posts do is get hate regardless of what they end up doing. It could build hype, but only losers like me get hyped about build changes.
---
I have a birthday booster active all the time. The magic and goldfind adds up.
---
Sorry, I've been hiding under a rock. How do I get the 15 cheevos?
---
Cantha is were in the World , west of elona or north?
---
Yes and no.  Yes, they can only be used in one tool at a time.  No, because you can keep your tools in a shared slot.  I just keep a regular set of tools in each of my chars inventories.  When I login I click the 3 tools to wield them.   This moves the regular tools into the shared slots.  Before I logout I click on the three slots to move the tools back into shared inventory.
---
It took a while to remember to do that but now its just part of my login/logout process.
---
Yes. He has both equipped, unequips one, equips both again, and unequips one, so on.

---
He says how bad the rolls are right here, lul
---
This is pretty comprehensive and a good explanation of the strengths of each class.
---
Power Berserker belongs on the Warrior too. It loses some CC from core warrior, but adds a shitton of damage. Great class.
---
DH also has access to a lot of utility options at the cost of some DPS. Reflects and stability primarily. I promise this is a completely objective fact: DH is actually the best class in the game : P
---
I disagree with Power Holo being one brain cell. The rotation has to swap between a lot of kits and you need to manage heat. It's simple enough though.
---
Daredevil is more useful than Deadeye on like 90% of all encounters, despite having slightly less theoretical damage.
---
In fact, most of the  "one braincell" things should be taken with a grain of salt. Even Core Warrior. Yeah, you can do passably with minimal effort since the main reason you're brought is banners and CC and the rotation is simple in theory. But the optimization for that class is massive. The difference between a good Core Warrior and a one brain cell Core Warrior is going to be extremely obvious.
---
Yeah. That about sums things up.
---
Mesmer is the class that can do the most. They're ANets favorite for sure. But it's also the most complicated class.
---
Warrior is also extremely versatile, and a lot easier.
---
To be noted that, for instance, quartz node could give charged quartz sometimes. So people could get everything needed for the skyscale without ever manually charging some.
---
Plus, I'm using infinite unbound/volatile magic tools, so the more I gather, the more value I get. Gathering all the nodes from LW3/LW4 every day brings me free trinkets every few weeks/months.
---
Yep on sandswept isle there was a similar thing within a collection.
---
In the game client you can type:
---
/wiki pile of elemental essence
---
and the client will automatically open the wiki page for that item in your default browser. You can also ping the item after putting "/wiki " in the chat bar instead of manually typing its name by shift-clicking the item.
---
So it's my fault for not stalking your profile?
---
You have yet to actually state here what you would have preferred, other than the extremely petty "I want better writers." I want ANet's writing team to step up their game too, and when they fail my expectations, I try my best to offer better ways they could have handled it. None of your criticism in this thread is constructive.
---
Until you actually articulate your desires for the story, you're just going to be an aimless angry presence.
---
It worked for me after I grabbed the first 2 or so VM and then going back sitting there waiting a bit. Kinda buggy
---
I've got nothing against flashy skins, but I agree that they don't always need to be. Bonetti's Rapier is probably my favorite sword skin, and it's...just a rapier.
---
i liked!
---
What invisible dlc one?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu297b/datamining_upcoming_features_from_the_may_28_patch/
---
Was waiting for this. Thank you!
---
I've had a blast so far. 
---
A big long arsed collection, like aurora is just what we need.
---
Now you made a personal attack which is against sub rules. Thank you for giving me an opportunity to shut you down.
---
New region (at least as far as masteries are concerned) with a new class of masteries.  Obviously masteries themselves are living world fodder already, but those are based on the expansion masteries from which they derive, and use expansion mastery points.  They could create a new class that are unrelated to previous expansions, with new unique regional points.
---
Globs of Ecto, Anthology, and the Ectoplasmic Stone light up, but it doesn't take the infusion unfortunately.
---
https://i.imgur.com/aMCOotz.png is my setup and these are my settings: https://i.imgur.com/HN9LD7G.png I put postprocessing to low for the vid. 
---
FPS is a bit higher in the vid than usual, because I was looking at the void in the Mistlock Sanctuary. Also, I recorded at 1920x1080 but rendered in 4K, because it increases the bitrate when watching the video at 1080p on youtube.
---
Hmm, I just did the Melandru's Tears collection event and it didn't count for me.
---
Thanks! It seems that you can put a exotic weapon like a sword but yesterday when people tried only the animation happened and not the combination itself...Strange!
---
I'm also a bit out of the loop as I wasnt there. Feel free to correct me.
---
My understanding is there is a dude by the mystic toilet asking for ppl to donate mithril. I think there is a bar that fills up as more and more ppl contribute. 
---
It rewards AP points and also you get 5k karma. Only thing is, when it filled up, nothing happened. So some ppl left the map, others may have switched instance or even thought that was all and left. 
---
Maybe some instance was bugged or took a long time after max bar to reward the players and reward was not viewed as worthwhile. This is probably what people are mad about in the map chat
---
That's my best guess I've been able to piece together.
---
We do often get a preview post a week or so ahead of a patch outlining some major changes, outlining reasoning and intent.  Those are welcome, but different from discussions earlier in the process when feedback could still be incorporated.
---
just let us dye the sleeve/weapon :(
---
As if I said anything about what breaks the immersion, except mentioning fire effects? I simply said it has been possible since launch.
---
For me the Dragonfall action one triggered after doing the collection events that happen at the three camps - Melandru’s tears, Soul Binders and Embers.
---
I tried all sorts of other events, and the bridges (someone said that did it for them) but had no luck. As soon as I did the collection events it pinged. You have time to hit up all three just to cover yourself.
---
I'm thinking S5 might be an update season. As in we return to some of the lower-quality core maps and update them to 2019 standards. All the while we take on smaller local stories.
---
Yes, but I don't think many people are complaining about the combined effects. Just that individually they should be different from one another, then when combined give that same effect.
---
&gt; Like “why am I going to bother learning to play necromancer if in the near future they are going to nerf it’s damage?”
---
For each of those posts, you'll see 50 millions others to the tune of "DA FUQ?!?!?!?!?!?!?! Y U NO NURF OP NECRO DAMAGGG??!?!?!?!?!" if that was indeed the case. And if it wasn't then nerfing necro damage in that situation would obviously require explanations, communication of the end goal to the community, who would be rightfully demanding to know why that is happening.   
---
I fail to see how that would be worse than just getting nerfs out of the blue with weak retroactive justification at best.
---
Did the currency patch affect all of the lws4 maps? Because I don't feel any change in Domain of Kourna.
---
I went up there last weekend and was very disappointed find out that neither the roof nor the mountain are solid.
---
On the other hand, I now know what the underside of the map looks like
---
Oh I hope I can make it finally getting back into this game and lots of stuff I missed out on
---
An actual full mastery track within a single lw ep would be awesome as far as I'm concerned. if they'd done that with season 3 and 4 we'd basically have two expansions worth of masteries to fill out from lw alone, so it's a shame they weren't necessarily going the full way from the get-go.
---
Maybe some formatting would help this post. (:
---
That being said, the biggest thing season 5 has to bring in my opinion are especs. They are the one thing relevant in all game modes and the very first thing associated with "normally exclusive to expansions".
---
It would be a real shame if they fail to deliver them.
---
I have doubts that raid trinket will be so directly tied to LS ones.  Dedicated players will probably have all three, but they are still obtained from very different kinds of pve. 
---
I would also like to see some new effects on the ring. No more balls, please.  Especially if you have to physically gather all three thrinkets on one (and only) character to get full effect.
---
Im having similar issues, non related to beetle. Could be the fact I'm using 2 screens and windowed fullscreen. Either that or for some reason my standby isnt being cleared regularly.
---
Hopefully the first episode will be the biggest of all in term of features. I wouldn’t want to be drip-fed limited amount of elites per episode.
---
So I’m hoping we get at least all elites in S5E1. As for what main big feature we will get I’m not sure. We still don’t have an underwater mount. They could also make it possible for us to *walk* underwater. Build templates are coming too.
---
We’ll also likely get a new guild hall so I wouldn’t mind new guild content.
---
This right here is why people clamor for removal of infusions and other visual noise.
---
I run these monthly, so keep out for the first Saturday of the month! \^\_\^
---
I mentioned this on the comment above, but I run these monthly, so keep out for the first Saturday of the month! \^\_\^
---
Hmm, gonna have to check that out! :)
---
I managed to buy it for 2.9k gold and I have 13 infusions applied including the mystic infusion. Unfortunately it doesn't stack with winters heart infusions but it does stack with my polysaturating (purple) infusion \^\^
---
Alright , there goes my last hope to stat swap some gear to try out a diviner's build in fractals.
---
No. It has been like this since Ep. 6 came out. [GW2 PvP: Maverick Hunter X](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bpiu20/gw2_spvp_maverick_hunter_x/)
---
Note that this isn't an -increase- of bots. It is just now that the bots are more apparent since the human player population is busy with Ep. 6 stuff. I.e. imagine if GW3 released who would be left in GW2? Die hard fans, fans out of the loop, and all the bots still left running.
---
Anet **should** be aware of the situation and deal with it however their current policies are. In the meanwhile report your little heart away and adjust your META for a bot game.
---
#Bot Meta
---
* Capture 2 points.
---
* Sustain on the 3rd point. Tick win EZPZ.
---
* Bots only capture nodes and hunt players. So if you don't actually lead them to map objectives, e.g. Bell, Tranquility, Artifacts, they can be easily taken. (There are a few exceptions).
---
* Only ONE person go for a map objective if they are completely bot free.
---
* Bots can't jump. Find a tricky to get to perch and they are putty in your hands.
---
how did you get passed the bugged skyscale rifts? they never seem to work for me any ideas?
---
Welcome back to the game! I pride my trains on being new player friendly, so hopefully this will be a good way for you to get back on your feet again :D
---
Thank you for such a detailed response!  My long term goals are just to be able to do T4 dailies and do the required CMs to get Ad Infinitum.  I know it definitely won't be optimal, but do you think running this build would accomplish those goals?: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage_-_Condi_DPS_Chaos_(Fractal)
---
They must be pretty excited to make out with that bird
---
How about 
---
"I can lay down my banners and inspire my allies"
---
"I can endure any amount of damage for 5 seconds straight"
---
"I can shout really loud and energize my entire squad with my bravado"
---
"I can crack the ground with the impact of my leaps"
---
Act I think the most impressive one is
---
"I can hold my totally mundane shield up and nothing will get through"
---
I've been thinking about either creating an EU account or transferring servers at some point. We'll have to see! :\]
---
Should clarify I was just throwing out alternatives for what they could mean.  New elite specs, or new specializations in general (maybe smaller scale changes that can be slotted in as normal specializations, which maybe don't have to include a new weapon) would also fit the bill for sure, and could be fun *if* they have ideas ready.  Totally plausible.
---
I have the wierd feeling that some of the people I played t4s today with were bots too .
---
As with all forms of gambling, it's most profitable for people who are not about to go broke.
---
If you teleport using a skill (Blink, Phase Retreat, Etc.) while ending Continuum Split (CS) you will teleport to the point you started CS then teleport immediately to where your teleport skill would have taken you anyway essentally allowing you to "Triple Cast" teleport skills with mimic even after the nerf that made it so mimic couldn't be reset by CS.
---
I have personally found that tweaking the config file can improve a lot of in game freezing and stuttering.
---
However I will not be able to give accurate causality on the what and why so I will refrain from doing so. The site had a lot of helpful information on what each setting modified. https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Custom-configuration
---
Anyone know when a sale on HoT is coming? I really really want to buy it but life you know. How often does the sale come up?
---
nah son. His fashion wars game is good. Infusions destroy the fashion always
---
There are basically two types of changes, balance changes and design changes.
---
Balance changes they don't need much feedback on.  Players point out what is over/under performing, which can be checked against internal metrics and adjusted.  You could in principle have a discussion of why things are over performing, but that is pretty in the weeds.  There is only so much to discuss here.
---
Design changes are a different beast.  There's definitely untapped value in opening up threads on design changes to crowd source ideas, and they should do more to encourage that.  There are a lot of creative players, and while most ideas are poor a few are truly excellent.  
---
As for evaluating particular design choices, besides a sanity check on really bad ideas players don't offer too much.  Most feedback on a particular design change will be negative (status quo bias).
---
So they would certainly benefit from doing more, though still less than I imagine most players think.
---
&gt; I like the new effect and I'd rather not see it changed. There -- a comment praising the decision,
---
Do you fail to understand that
---
* **no one is asking to change the NEW, COMBINED effect of 2 trinkets equipped together**, and
---
* **people are asking to change the OLD, REUSED BASE effect on the new Vision item only**
---
so that they can get some fashion choice instead of a visual duplicate of Aurora?
---
in addition ranger going Paragon and gaining Shout skills back.
---
My guess is they didn't want to add Chants or are changing the F5 to a selectable chant that gets refreshed on shout.
---
Unfortunately charr with long horns will clip into the wing.
---
I'm not really a Mesmer player so I can't say anything about the build itself but since it is rated with a 4.6 I think it will work.
---
1. There's a sale every 3 months or so for half off, I'd just play around in the base game for a while until the next sale.
---
2. Only Season 1 was pulled, but you can read up on what happened both through a story thing in game or on the wiki.
---
3. metabattle.com for pvp builds, best realm is up for debate.
---

5. Tons of future content planned, company is holding together fine, just had a major story release.
---
6. I'm US but I haven't heard anything bad about EU.
---
7. Game is great if you like to just work on your own goals and not worry about having the top gear all the time. If your style of fun is gear grinding this isn't the game for you. You can get BIS gear in a month or so and be good forever. I'd say that's the main difference from other MMOs. Also get raptor as soon as you buy PoF, I couldn't play this game before mounts.
---
it's not a bug, it's to prevent players from multi looting maps
---
So a skin post-processing infusion. Looks like it'd work great with Ghostly Infusion.
---
Human female meta is like "[AND THIS IS TO GO EVEN FURTHER BEYOOOOND!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8TGalu36BHA)"
---
Theres been a guy in SW afk farming for god knows how long. I reported him several times and even tweeted at GuildWars2 with a picture. Didn't get a response.
---
They did however congratulate and retweet people for getting the skyscale or the new skyscale chair.
---
We'll see.
---
Yeah I play max settings with a 1080ti with 120Hz
---
Elite specs would be ideal. If you ask me there had been numerous hints at classes to come with stuff like the ohmalkhan and several utility lines being renamed due to difficultys with spreading such as engineers having entirely unique utility lines and suddenly they rename only scrappers? I feel more changes are coming in this mannet and it can only imply that its cleaning up for stuff that can be passed along. 
---
Things like elixers and gadgets could be moved to say thief and rangers and now that ranger shouts got renamed to commands it suggests an elite spec with a pet is coming. Probsbly on ele or necro possibley engineer like a golemancer that has been forshadowed for anlong time with taimi. She does actually have a class yet and blish was clearly dropped as a method to save taimi that could lead into a golemancer spec easy.
---
The patch mostly just made changes to various PoF maps, not LWS4 maps. I think the only change that would effect Kourna is bounties dropping double the amount of Elegy Mosaics.
---
Thats a much better shot.  OP's is terrible
---
But you *do* act like what he said in his comment. 
---
You didn't brought up a single argument, no constructive critism, nothing. Your comments only aimed to run his arguments down, in a dirty and childish way. 
---
And no, "I have enough argements, there in those other threads" is *no* argument. 
---
So before you threaten other people for "breaking sub rules", you should search your own conscience. Nobody likes hypocrites or assholes.
---
as lovely as new especs would be, i just don't see them happen because i suspect when they say xpac content in LW i'm assuming they mean in smaller quantities and especs just can't be split up into smaller quantities without a massive shitshow
---
Hi stalker
---
I was playing a character I made almost 6 years ago, a Sylvari. I remember before the jump animation would get me up top of walls and stuff, ramparts. But the jumps I was doing now barely reached the height of the wall or rampart bit. Like the jumps were looking a little lower when moving visually then I remembered.
---
If you're lucky you only need 25 ectos.
---
I realize this is probably an unpopular opinion here, but... I like many of the "blinged-out" weapons. I don't think they look out-of-place in a fantasy setting at all -- particularly a fantasy setting where magic is at the center of the main plot, and where technology is also advancing and is canonically used alongside magic (see: almost everything the asura do).
---
There are definitely some weapons that cross the line even for me, or just don't fit my personal taste, sure. And I think it's awesome that we're getting a whole update of mostly normal-ish weapons, too, because those also have a place. I just don't understand all the hate for shiny stuff. If I'm going to play a fantasy game in a fairly unique setting where magic is approached in a somewhat scientific way, you better believe I'd prefer to have my heroic character using something that looks like a fantastical magically-charged weapon rather than running into battle with a plain old sword. There are tons of games where I can dig -- and play -- the plain old sword aesthetic, and even more where I can run around with a "real" gun. But this particular game supports crazy shiny magic-spewing stuff very well, I think.
---
the rifts for this aren't bugged. ya just gotta do 'em twice. if you pay attention, you'll notice that the first time is just collecting volatile magic, and the 2nd time gives you a "buff" to show how many you have left to hit.
---
I see two horns so shouldn't we call them bicorns ?
---
They kinda already did stuff like this though. Think of [Fort Salma](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fort_Salma), the ruins of the [Tower of Nightmares](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Viathan_Lake), and just the entirety of Lion's Arch. Like the Personal Story's main points are within instances that they display the original old instances of a map while openworld sections takes place in a more recent timeline.
---
yikes that's seriously clingy
---
1) look at the Anet retailers on their website, and see what sites have sales going on. I'd advise against using sellers not on the list of retailers. 
---
2) no, sorry, we can't access season 1 anymore. Everything is accessible, but season 1 was done so differently that all you can do now is read or watch the story
---
3) 2 things here.
---
A) they've put in a lot more PvE content since before, more instanced content, more exciting open world events, etc, so if you're a PvE player I'd advise looking into what's changed
---
B) try joining a guild for WvW, they'll be able to help you out a lot. If you look at leaderboards, you can tend to find which servers are doing better, and you can find PvP and WvW builds on metabattle. Try watching some videos too (can't recommend any immediately) to see how different classes play in sPvP
---
4) for builds: metabattle, snowcrows (raids), discretize (fractals), and I believe that vabbi is up to date on WvW builds
---
For achievements and collections: check out dulfy's guide
---
For other things, the wiki is good place to start. There are guides for almost everything, just depends on what you need
---
5) yes, season 5 is coming next, that's for sure, after that is unknown but likely an expansion. No guarantees of course about that
---
6) populated
---
7) check out the returning player guide on the sidebar. Other than that, just feel free to jump back in. A lot has changed but a lot has also stayed exactly the same as it was before
---
Can we seriously get an option to hide all infusions on other players? I’m tired of seeing epeens flopping around. This game has children that play too, geez.
---
Not everybody stalks people, even if you assume that (as we can see in your previous comments).
---
All the time on dlgamer (official retailer).
---
You can't really draw any conclusions from only 45 roles. It could be all luck, or there could actually be something wrong.
---
weird flex, but ok
---
Play nice.
---
But you weren't sleeping :thonk:
---
Dps increase, say nothing /s
---
How *dare* the marketing team do marketing stuff!  For Shame!
---
Also just because you saw someone doing effortless farming doesn’t mean they aren’t being responsive when devs come by to check on them.  There is just no way to “know” because anet doesn’t provide readouts/responses to players for results of reports that they submit.
---
Lmao, this video is legend  💛
---
do you have tomes of knowledge? At level 80, each tome equals one spirit shard
---
Other than that, it's just a matter of farming experience. Once you've gotten all the masteries in a region, then every time you level up you get a spirit shard instead
---
I don't know if it can get more decent than gw2 wiki, which is the first result after you google something about gw2.
---
In case you didn't know, you can craft ascended with core stats and stat swap it in mystic forge to avoid unnecessary materials required for crafting ascended gear witg HoT/PoF stats (also found on wiki). For weapons there's plenty of collections that make them basically free.
---
Yep, its all circumstantial evidence. Someone will get extremely lucky and be like "Wow guys see, its not all that bad!". You have to go based off of the average, and OP is definitely in the minority case in terms of pre drops from the MF haha.
---
Oh, lol. Took me a second to get it. Nice find!
---
importanly, did you make a proffit doing this?
---
&gt; - Vision of Equipment: Dragon Champion Armor - Complete one weight class of Tier 1 Mist Shard armor. This requires to complete 6 achievements from War Eternal : the bridges events, the waterfalls achievement, the champions achievement, and the 3 achievements where you have to complete 10 events in each area of the map.  
---
I did all of that but choose different weight on each piece (3 light, 2 medium, 1 heavy) because that's the ones I liked. Achievement didn't count, I guess I have to craft the missing parts.
---
I actually didn't know about that. The way I go with crafting it is I bought the recipes and now I am gathering the materials. Mystic forge is still a complete mystery to me.
---
I never said they shouldn't just said I didn't get a response, which you reiterated in your message. No need to get worked up.
---
maybe,but color is still same,last time you seen purple/pink necro,warrior,ranger,guard? btw,my whole post was joke,you keyboard aragorn.
---
No tomes of knowledge left. And I am still a long way from completing any masteries anywhere unfortunately.
---
He edited it...15.
---
And then the oceans swelled. The clouds dispersed. And a wave unlike ever before touched the very skies.
---
Selbbub has come.
---
Holy shit, how many characters do you have? gotta be like 20+ right?
---
you know you can craft those things right? 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Diviner%27s_Intricate_Gossamer_Insignia
---
What’s the point? The stuff you’ve got isn’t even worth the price for those ectos and exotics.
---
Those weapons will be like 100g in couple a days and even most expensive precursor isn’t more then 750g. 
---
But I guess someone has to do it so everyone could see that’s not worth it ;)
---
Is it a legit website? I was looking around and people are dating you might get ban cause there’s a chance 3rd party website use stollen cards.
---
I see, just thought you were convinced that the god's realms were all that existed in the mists :P Honestly during the joko thingy i would have enjoyed having mad king thorn and his real come into play somehow, they had deep hatred towards each other after all. Mists have such potential that i don't know where to begin on what i would like to see haha
---
Aha! I see! Thank you very much!
---
This one is, you can find the list on main gw2 website.
---
Wow very cool! I like it more than my skyscale\~
---
Revenant is pretty much everything in one class with Kalla + Shiro.
---
Shiro has amazing DPS, fair amount of evades and disengages and some CC removal. With 2 skills he is able to spam quickness and double strike plus perma super speed. You can easily melt any normal mob in half a second. And if you use offhand sword, you can blink to a second mob for another half-a-second burst. Shiro is pure raw, burst damage.
---
Kalla has CC able to remove most champions blue bars with one skill, and healing powerful enough to jump from 1% to 100% hp (even while surrounded) with what I think is life link (health on every hit) . Too many times I have been near dead, popped Kalla's elite and got back to full HP just hitting #1.
---
In practice, the class is amazing if you like jack of all trades. Weapons really give you the choice to do whatever you want, but I just enjoy way too much hammer &amp; 2 swords. I still run full berserker's even in WvW as long as I'm part of a train and I'm able to tag, kill or scape anything I put my eyes on.
---
God I love this class. It gives me the feeling of originality and satisfaction that only Mesmer in Gw1 and Warden in LOTRO gave me. I like playing "the original class", "the class" from an MMORPG, the one that is unique to that game and you won't see in any other, and Revenant IS **the class** from Gw2.
---
**EDIT**: I think I forgot about OP question since I got distracted with my love for the class. 
---
[What does the rev excels at?](#s "ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING")
---
Hey this is a good reason to do dungeons again, you can use the dungeon's currency to buy the exotics.
---
Well its not that it is a straight up flag announcing that that is indeed the path they are taking for the story, but hey, one can dream :3
---
so to get the torch I need to mix 3 exotic torches with that Ectoplasmic stone?
---
*\*ktch\** "Uhhh, commander?"
---
\*Commander sighs, deeply\*
---
Yeah, but given that both swords are now up and running it feels like a waste not giving it to logan at some point. Unless they give it to one of Doric's descendants heh
---
Oh sweet. Maybe I’ll buy it next time.
---
Fuck the rap shit my gangsta been solidified
---
Not in Tyria, anyway.
---
I come from dark souls lore, nothing is ever straight up flag announcing, but one can dream indeed ;3
---
Pic?
---
&gt;What can we possibly do right now to finish Glint's plan?
---
Find replacements for Zhaitan and Mordremoth, since Aurene shouldn't handle the weight of three Elder Dragons, and since the world dies if there's fewer than four Elder Dragons, finding two new, benevolent Elder Dragons like Aurene to share the burden also gives the world a buffer for when the next Elder Dragon becomes a threat.
---
That said, the description for Primordus' and Jormag's slumber matches the ending of Dragonfall meta, where Kralkatorrik encases himself in crystal to heal himself. Inactive, immobile, but awake and feeding. So I don't think they're actually asleep - and Jormag should still be accessible with a bit of work, just like Kralkatorrik was.
---
We do have respite, and I like the ending myself, but we're a very short time from the next major threat. Though I do believe, based on the Guild Chat 85 two weeks back, that the next plot won't be a "world ending plot" but still dangerous. I expect something on par to the White Mantle situation, just without a horribly written Balthazar "plot twist".
---
This should be fixed with the latest hotfix.

I think its fine if you dont stack so many different colors. Personally use an ember+auri+bee+kodas and a poly gray. Its when the mix of the entire rainbow with x8 of every infu comes together that my eyes bleed.

Love this video! The subtitles are pretty spot on :) Funny how people think they're ebtitled to more rewards than the lootboxes and ap's that were stated in game though. :p
---
I feel bad for the pvp community
---
Can we beg devs for some blurry gifs? Oh god I would love one every week until we get next ls.
---
2,369 days, nothing thrown into the forge in a serious manner, I've gotten 6 precursors as drops. So the whole "I never get precursors and I play since beta :(((" Sounds like all they do is AFK in LA and expect precursors to drop from the monthly chest or something.
---
I really wonder how many people play concurrently at peak times. I willing to bet the game doesn’t break 35k. Maybe only on big patch days and I doubt it ever breaks 50k... which is sad but this is what anet wants and this is what the majority of the community wants. You can’t piss on all dedicated content. It’s a vicious cycle. Anet wanted a casual game and marketed it as “you can leave and come back whenever you want”...what kind of game studio... No! A company markets its product like that? This is what they wanted, this is what the majority of the players support and DO NOT wish to be changed (be honest with yourselves, you do not want a change for a more hardcore direction) and so, this is what you get. Honestly idc at this point anyway. This game forced me to become casual so...i dont want the game to change either now, let it be what it is.
---
Ghostly looks different
---
In which PvP League do you play? I am curious because I never saw a bot in my last 50 or 60 games this season.
---
tried 100 flushes, didn't expect anything but pulled a pre.
---
tried 8 hands of sandstorm, then 32 more with the winnings, +700g and a merchant =D
---
/r/UnexpectedThanos/
---
Nice try but no.
---
I'm not saying there hasn't ever been a PvE player who has joined WvW and acted like a dick. What I am saying is that for every 1 time that happens, WvW mains tell 100 PvE players to kill themselves.
---
I opened it in the app
---
Some of the living world maps don't have direct access from the open world map and after being transported there for the story you have to get back using waypoints or tp scrolls.  Bloodstone Fen comes to mind as an example.
---
How do we roll for a precursor?
---
I can wait a bit longer for a full legy set, but give me a new elite spec for mah ranger and build templates and i'll be in heaven  hehe
---
u need to choose all 6 part of armor same class. e.g: all 6 armor heavy class. not 3ligh 2med 1 heavy my dudu XD. in your case i think u can craft 3 rest of the light armor and get the collection. write " Diviner's Mist " at craft page u will able to craft it becuase all 3class is giving u "Recipe Book" when u unlock 1 class.
---
That's all i need? Thats easy fam
---
that's a really good point that I hadn't thought about. On the one hand it's not like we have a shortage of hero points at all and it'd encourage people to go back and do the hp challenges on old maps, and finally have a use for those points? but that could also lead to strange moments where someone who only has PoF or something is having trouble getting their second elite spec because of how far they'd have to go, getting pretty much every challenge avaliable to them.
---
Wow this look better than another picture I saw. Making think it was crap. I'd get it if it were 300 gold max. I would not pay more than that since it doesnt have foot falls or a trail, as people mentioned.
---
I think you're basically right. Nothing else is expansion exclusive apart from new 'types' of masteries.
---
Would it?
---
Honestly, I think that'd be a great way to release them.
---
*Especially* if they're going to revisit central Tyria.
---
I'd love to see an extended S5 where episodes alternate between a new map episode followed (or preceded) by a revisit of a region. Say...hunting down clues as to the whereabouts of a lost legionairre throughout Ascalon in episode 1, then in episode 2 you follow those clues into the Blood Legion Homelands. When you are searching for clues, you learn about the new elite, then in the new map, you gain access to it.  The insatiable drive to fill out your elite may even drive you back into HoT and PoF maps for extra HP. 
---
Figure 5 regions (Ascalon, Shiverpeaks, Kryta, Maguuma, Orr), that's 2 elite specs per region, that you might as well introduce two per episode pair, with one alone in the last pair (personally, I'd say take us south to Cantha next, save Orr for last, have the last elite spec be Necro, then have the new zone be an archipelago between Orr and Shing Jea island that's inhabited by risen, afflicted, and the undersea dragon's minions...as well as quaggans, krait, asura, and human and tengu outcasts from Cantha...with a few largos skulking about.
---
Whatever the over-arching story of the season, we're following clues left by...*someone* (or some*ones*) intentionally meant to take us here.
---
Maybe rather than the rather overused (by now) trope of the pact showing up in force, we would have a LS based on sneaking around with little support, focused on intrigue more, and less in large scale conflict. 
---
For a dragon we know so little about, I could see its secondary domain, after water, being deception, or secrets, or something...the inverse of Lyssa's domain of trickery with water secondary...and she would play prominently in helping the small group of heroes fight from the shadows using trickery, disguises, and misdirection.
---
Was sarcasm. Apparently my sarcasm game is weak :/
---
Yeah, when I first tried the infusion out my character had pretty much all skin aside from the face covered with armor with a blue/purple outline poly on in the light on a light skinned character, so it was fairly easy to miss it. Tried again in a darker area with some borrowed/traded other poly infusions and an outfit and it was more noticeable than before.
---
That is beyond fucking amazing OMG dude.
---
I fucking love it.
---
I dont know the slightest thing about Clay, is it possible to color it? That would look dope!

The Detail in the Hair Ü\_Ü

Basically if you're whiter than a clean sheet the effect is pretty hard to see.

They won't announce anything on E3. It will most likely be like with last one, just for business/industry meetings.

Our God dulfy has abandoned us. Couldn't take the skyscale bs, so she moved on. Godspeed wherever you are Dulfy. You were a light that shined bright in the dark world of collections. Thank you for everything.
---
That's been around for years.  One of GW2s cryptids .
---
They are for bots.
---
  Bots will try to mine them, then anet can ban them
---
Have you seen the ring effect with it as well?
---
It's more than 2 items, the two earrings are similar and combine to make an item. I agree it may seem lazy, but 2 identical earrings to create custom one that looks good to me i'm a fan of personally. 
---
The ring and the definition of the name of the ring. Coalescence makes sense literally and figuratively and even visually. To that i'm a fan of.
---
Join some guilds.  There are plenty that advertise in map chat.  There is also another subreddit for guild recruitment.  Find one that feels right, and you'll feel much better.

Sculpting is just my new hobby. I don't know anything about art dev stuffs.

RIP those who blew money on mithril ingots while they were at their highest.

Awesome job dude!
---
Probably depends on what kind of clay you’re using (like, whether you have to worry about it exploding in a kiln or something) but... at least with polymer or epoxy clays, I’ve used aluminum foil over the wire. You can use foil to the point where most of the volume is foil with a fairly thin layer of clay over it — also helps tweak things for balance (tho seems like you got that part down already!). Or if you don’t want the bulk, wrap the big wire loosely with some thinner wire, so it has ridges to anchor the clay. 
---
Good luck, hope you keep making &amp; posting these!
---
The feels.
---
Thank you for that reference
---
Expansion-worthy features can also mean completely new systems that you usually would expect from an expansion, like some sort of housing system, or something that expands on the combat system.
---
Rise up
---
I cheated on the balance. The wire from the frame extends downwards past the foot and into the wood.
---
I'll have to try the trick of wrapping thinner wire around the main wire. I had some foil in the chest, but that's it. On my first attempt with armature, I ran into an issue where I made the foil too thick and I wanted to avoid that here.
---
As an NA player you can mail items to EU players too, you just can't play with them.
---
The only fractal where you can kind of justify running Condi Firebrand is Siren's Reef, just from the sheer number of adds to cleave. For the rest, definitely run Power Dragonhunter.
---
Does this game get any new players? And does it have a consistent playerbase? Me and a friend would like to try it, but seeing completely empty "noobie" zones is very daunting and dull.
---
Also a lot easier to farm. I think you forgot Vision is a Legendary, an endgame prestige item you don't need. But if you want it, you gotta work for it.
---
the other thing thats inconsistent with other lws4 maps is that istan literally craps out shittons of kralkatite.
---
Engi is great for gathering too. Throw elixir S for stealth, use elixir U for quickness (quickness works for gathering and opening chests), also you can drink elixir S for further 3 seconds of OOC, and it doesn't interrupt your gathering!
---
This is what happens when people farm a single map and meta for over a year - ANet needs to introduce a way to drain them from the playerbase.
---
End result? People who weren't farming said metas suffer.
---
Istan hearts give 5 times as much kralkatite as the other hearts give their currencies, and it's easier to get from other sources as well.  The extra cost for the weapons isn't outrageous in view of that.
---
Thank you! Will look out for it next month!
---
does it make the eyes glow white?
---
Each heart in Istan gives 75 Kralkate per character.  Meaning 4 of them gives you 300 Kralkatite.   So do hearts on 2 characters = 600 per day ~ 5 days =3,000 ore.
---
WvW and PvP, it is possible to be downed there ;-)
---
How do you obtain this infusion?
---
Seeing all these posts about new players I think it has a lot of them. Core game is free with some restrictions so it doesnt hurt to try.
---
Oh thank Grenth, that sucked last time.
---
The noobie zones are anything but empty.   
---
1. New players come in all the time because the game is F2P, and players from certain big MMOs are exploring other options at the moment.  
---
2. Existing players still make new characters, and these characters still need map completion.  
---
3. There's always reason for max level characters to visit new player zones. Whether it's daily achievements, jumping puzzles, collection achievements, new player zones are not just for new players.  
---
3. There are major event chains that happen in each of the new player zones. I won't spoil too much but this results in huge influx of players every once in a while.
---
&gt;And is not the only way to bug the collection at this part. If in the 3rd part (Miasma Research) of the Brandstone Research Collection, Yasna gives you more than one Particle Collector (yes it can happen when you interact with Yasna more than once the same day) and you keep it in your inventory while doing this event, it won't count for the achievement. It won't give you the Mirror Calibration Readings.
---
Yea this just looks like eye-cancer to me
---
Thanks for the link. I knew there was a build site that I used to use, but couldn’t remember the name. This is it!
---
Nothing original?
---
The majority of those laid off werent even working on GW2. Those that took the fall for their coworkers not included
---
Hm I had my warrior on a condi build waaaay back when. Then I stat changed his ascended set to zerker lol
---
Noxxi is a fucking legend
---
I'm waiting on high res versions of lots of things... Have you seen Heavy Carapace legs?
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday with Aurora, so it doesn’t seem exclusive. 🙈
---
I'm so glad you mentioned 3 and 4 being a newbie and seeing the veteran players in end game gear is always fun, cause as we all know.. fashion is end game. And these major events and things that affect the entire world is a nice change of pace.
---
&gt; No waypoints needed
---
&gt; For the train, please make sure you have:
---
Shipwreck Peak Waypoint
---
We've all been cheated and lied to! 
---
But joking aside this is insanely useful.  My main character STILL hasn't finished the Tangled Depths due to certain hero points.
---
Sure, but you can still redeem your false legendary status. I'm not entirely sure what point you're trying to make. Other than people downstate in PvP/WvW more frequently, but again, maybe they're not so legendary after all?
---
Renegade doesn’t have constant superspeed, only Herald. And only if you’re constantly using upkeep with the trait Rising Momentum.
---
As someone who started the game just over a year ago, I hated this though. It was so immersion breaking. It really throws off us newer players.
---
That prefix came from the search and is a content filter, though not the one I personally use. sf seems to be no shout-outs and no fluff.
---
Another thing you can do with sculpey and things like the claws, to make them harder, is put them in the freezer for a bit. Works for lots of situations... want sharp geometric edges? Freeze a lump &amp; cut with a sharp knife. Want tiny individual feathers etc? Freeze them before attaching, so they won’t squish if you look at them funny. 
---
Tons of cool sculpey tricks out there :D
---
OMG, this is terrible. I got only 2 pieces reseted. A trinket and backpack. They got agony and didn't get removed. You should report a ticket for it, immediately D:
---
How did you got it please? Do you have a screenshot of the infusion by itself?
---
Thank you! Basically a tl:dr of the current meta. I appreciate it.
---
I know people have asked similar questions but I haven't found the exact answer. Apologies if I missed something.
---
Is there now an easier/different option to get/craft Diviner's gear other than Exquisite Serpentine Jewels from Hammer's Head and Thunderhead Meta?
---
Further Questions: I have an ascended chest piece I want to convert to Diviner's so I would assume that Serpentine Jewel's still only drop from the one place.
---
Otherwise, are there any easier ways to get stat selectable Diviner's that wasn't possible before (i.e. a HoT or base game meta that now gives PoF stats).
---
And yes, I know about Fractals, Raids, WvW, and PvP.
---
Hm. What would be a major event in Plains of Ashford? I legit can't think of anything.
---
This is an annoying thing for legendary backpieces too.
---
Was saving black lion tickets for it then they took it out of shop right before I had enough :’)
---
 \- **Vision of Landscapes: Domain of Kourna** \- *tbd*   
---
it is on top of the mastery point of Allied Encampment Waypoint \[&amp;BFcLAAA=\]
---
&gt; except maybe a few backline roles in WvW
---
Scourge and rev should be mostly zerk with maybe a couple cav trinkets. Weaver should be mauraders/zerk.
---
They should either be on timers or function like Silverwastes and Dragonfall where players can easily see and manipulate progression.
---
I'm REALLY hoping we'll get more Guild oriented updates with season 5.  The three decorations in Dragonfall are beautiful, but I would love to have a HUGE SCRIBE UPDATE with a good 50+ decorations.  Now /that/ would be expansion worth... to me....
---
Um. Each heart gives 25 per character, not 75.
---
Dont they only give 25 kralkatite per character?
---
I was having a bad day. This made me laugh. Thank you.
---
This discussion is pointless, this is annoying bug.
---
Its still from 3.5.2019 so no new patch out there yet.
---
I have like 5 and can't keep up.
---
It looks great!
---
on the other hand, 5000 karma is a rounding error.
---
This is incorrect, each heart gives 25.
---
This has been a bug since Gw2 launched.
---
Just got around to trying necro, this is what I wanted. Thank you for the input.
---
This looks so much better.
---
niceeee work
---
It’s sad because it has to skyscale grind
---
I give a lot of shit to these awful "art" posts that swamp this now shitty sub, but this is genuinely impressive. Good job, dude.
---
But... The four *horsemen* in the underworld
---
Poggers!
---
So when the servers are down can you play as the raptor down there, jumping over pyramids and palm trees?
---
It’s a nodachi. They sadly never released the Katana and Tanto skins.
---
None of the weapons are even over 100g. The infusion is the only expensive thing from this update. 
---
Don't want to gamble? Wait for prices to stabilize over the week and then buy the skins you want.
---
Edit: Just kidding, link not working :( Hopefully someone else can show you it
---
No problem. If you finish 3 daily achievements you will complete the Daily Completionist achievement. Which awards Achievement Points, 3 Spirit Shards, and 2 Gold. Note there is a cap to how many achievement points you can get this way. I think it is currently capped at 15,000 AP. Either way you still get the shards and gold for completing it.
---
You seem to have completely ignored the primary use, indicated by the fact that the name contains the phrases "recharging" and "teleport to friend".
---
"heads" up
---
Yes, I...sitting here...with my vision...am very hurt. How did you know? What gave it away? The fact that I stated a fact?
---
 **Vision of Landscapes: Jahai Bluffs**  is way up above the central tower of Displaced Towers.  This guide describes where the memory fragment for the Skyscale collection is.
---
I'd be sad too if Joko was dead
---
Personally I'd rather do any of things you listed before waiting. Skyscale collection is mostly just walking around and picking crap up.
---
You are a legend! Thank you so much!
---
someone probably already said this but
---
thief’s mobility is the reason i main it. granted with mounts, the difference now is small but i love gathering with my thief cus of shortbow and shadow refuge. and a decent dps class with power dd in raids is fun too.
---
It is in Armistice Bastion, WvW vip lounge -&gt; https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Armistice_Bastion_Pass
---
Which is a good thing, imo. It always bothered me that everyone flocked to one stat build. It’s nice to hear that isn’t necessarily the case anymore. Even though it sounds like 60-70% of the sets are still useless. 
---
I wonder how my guard would do as a condi build? I’m just using an open world power dps dragonhunter build from meta battle right now until I get the hang of my class again. 
---
But you’ve peaked my interest into some sort of Viper Guardian build now...
---
Thanks for that link!  I didn't realize there were so many options with solid documentation.  Should make increasing performance a breeze!
---
I hope so, I haven't finished the associated achievement. My OCD is itching.
---
Take a look!
---
I cant stop disconecting, its been an issue ever since last patch. What do i do?
---
WRONG! You didn’t sculpt the armor clipping issues (hahahaha) 
---
Jk, Great work!

I have friends irl. You should try it. And in the game I have world completion on 11 chars so if I want to join a friend online I just wp.
---
If the name was so clear why all the nerfs. Obviously you were not in the frontline when handing out intellect
---
She looks wonderful! Extremely well done.
---
In this pic I was actually using 13 infusions &gt;.&lt;
---
Redeker Kithicor is my main character.  Can't remember my account ID off the top of my head.
---
Elementalists can gather from nodes *while downed*. They can pop their mist form ability and harvest while in it.
---
So if you are getting rekt while trying to harvest, you can get that last hit or two in before you die.
---
Very impressive
---
 [http://gw2timer.com/?mode=Tile](http://gw2timer.com/?mode=Tile)  as well, enjoy!
---
Ooh, good question. Guess it depends on a) how thin you want it, and b) how important it is to have it made of clay. Here are some random ideas off the top of my head:
---
* use wire mesh for a full-surface armature, like with the index card. I know you can get small quantities of lightweight mesh with a fine weave sold either as craft material, or for general metal-screen uses, but I've never tried it. You could use a rolling pin to roll it into a flat sheet of clay, and it'd probably then be able to hold position reasonably well
---
* Use tinfoil etc to build a support beneath the wing surface, instead of an armature that goes inside. Drape the clay how you want it, bake with the foil in place, then remove the foil after
---
* Use a wire armature but disguise it as wing features (bones, veins, sinews whatever)
---
If you're willing to use materials other than sculpey for the wing, you could make the rest of the sculpture, bake it, and then use something else. Don't bake them afterwards lol. Ideas:
---
* fabric + fabric stiffener (you ever make those cheesecloth ghosts in kindergarten? good drapey effect) 
---
* silicone, like they sell as mold making material. Comes as a liquid, but you could probably paint it on something flat or shaped and then peel it off (good translucent-leather effect)
---
* 3d printer pen, if it's something like a bug wing or spiderweb, or you want a gossamer effect
---
* craft plastic, comes in sheets or pellets, you use either hot water or a heat gun to soften it up and then let it harden at room temp
---
Or finally:
---
* use the fire-separately method you tried, but just choose the attachment point so that you can hide the seams underneath some scales or feathers or whatever
---
Yessss the community in GW2 is freaking amazing! But I wont forget this incident. 
---
Last year, in the same week I bought the game with both expansions, I was lvling my first character in Caledon Forest. Someone said on map chat "The first 5 people who get to the top of Spekk's Lab JP can get 1 item of anything they want from the gem store". That day there were not many people so there was barely a response. I was near the JP so I thought oh well this could be fun. 
---
Turned out I was the first person to arrive. I thought they were joking so I stood still, unsure to ask about the reward. So they whispered me "hey what do you want?" and since I knew I would get the mounts when I do PoF I just said "would it be okay if I ask for the exo suit skin pack?" Literally after 5 sec I got a mail. They freaking sent it! I thought they wouldn't since it costed 2k gems but they did! I was soooo happy and kept thanking them. Other people who arrived then asked for kit, outfit skin etc but none of those item costed near mine so I felt (and still do) guilty for asking too much. That person is soooo cool. Hey if you happen to read this, thank you so much!!!!
---
then again, anyone who donated beyond last achievement without any idea what would happen, anyone who donated after the bar was full without any idea what would happen, anyone who bought 4s+ mithril ingots without any idea what would happen while it was obvious the achievs would be cheaper later ...
---
they deserve those 5000 karma :D
---
(seriously, no donation event ever came with insane rewards, or with better rewards for the guy who donates more than he should)
---
I really think it’s excellent!
---
I am returning after not playing for about 3 years and just bought both expansions but can't decide which profession to play because I have no clue what each one is like at endgame.  Is anyone able to give a rough overview of where each one is at or their playstyle?  I'm not looking for what is best, just a basic description of what each is like and their potential playstyles.
---
They are horrible
---
To be fair, bans are being handed out to extrem abusers of these kinds of oversights. We're talking about people multiboxing the everliving fuck out of that shit. Not of some random bloke who jumps one to three maps once every two hours for half a day.
---
What value do you use for *surface_limits* ?
---
There is something related to new players or returning players, i also experienced this myself with an Alt account and with returning friends.
---
Accounts that hasnt logged in for several years seem to get better items than someone who plays every day. (Probably to let them stay?)
---
🎤 I have a Charr warrior, I made it out of clay. 🎤
---
🎤 And when it's dry and ready, with Charr warrior I shall play. 🎤
---
How am I supposed to get into MMOs when the endgame is like this.  Stopped playing GW2 at level 70, for reference.  What got me to stop was being taken through the boss loop by the guild i just joined, evaporating the rest of the magic from the setting.
---
It's a small step for a player, but a giant leap for raptorkind
---
I'm hoping vision is bugged currently and shares the same same effect as Aurora unintentionally. 
---
How I think it was designed: 
---
1. Aurora is Aurora. 
---
2. Vision is the purple bubbles currently seen when you have both. 
---
3. The clone effect is what the effect **should** be when combining both Aurora and Vision.  
---
The clone effect seems like a clear combination of the bubbles + Aurora - the rotating globes are the same as aurora aside from color and the dark orb they are connected to has the same fluidity as the bubbles.
---
Looks like orbiting anal beads.
---
Oh, the bees.
---
I guess I'm too poor to see infusions properly.
---
Well, it doesn't seem like I can send you anything using that name. Just hit me up with the account ID or if you end up loggin in.
---
If they are unwilling to put in the work to fix the vanishing bowstrings bug or the mount spawn bug then i cant see why they would do anything about something like this, when it comes to polishing their game, Anet is super lazy.
---
Miyani. 25 ecto. New ecto gamble. Unique skins. New infusion.
---
But the raid content (just like elite specs) are locked behind the ownership of expansions. Content "normally exclusive to expansions" pretty much means elite specs and raids, no? Every other current aspect of the game (mounts, masteries, fractals, story instances) have been available in Living World.
---
Will Smith?
---
I'm guess the one with the most meta events will have the most people on. So, Orr and Crystal Desert.
---
I figured out but thanks for tryna help it's appreciated :)
---
This was already postet before: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/brwdu3/a\_simple\_guide\_to\_d9vk\_on\_windows\_for\_guild\_wars/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/brwdu3/a_simple_guide_to_d9vk_on_windows_for_guild_wars/)
---
We can even look to the initial rollout of elite specs in HoT and how many people did not like not having quick-to-immediate access to a fully unlocked elite spec, nevermind the idea of only having certain profession's elite specs available.
---
Core is always included with the expansions.
---
My god I can't even tell
---
I hate this map , weapons and events in. Its pure brainless farm fest with -10 fun. Cant wait to end this disgusting map.
---
Core game is free already. So yes, you can play it if you purchase either expansion.
---
Pay2convenience.
---
You’re not winning anything. You’re not beating any other person. Time. You’re in a battle with time. So yes, pay to defeat time.
---
The core game is free, even without PoF
---
So no, you do not have to purchase the core game as well if you buy PoF
---
Ah thank you. That's good to know
---
Which equipment are you talking about? Some stat selectable equipment won't be reset as is stated in the patch notes.
---
Holy crap how did people already unlock this?
---
There's no time-gating like Aurora?
---
Ok. I got the game 6 years ago and I thought maybe you had to buy the core game plus any expansions you wanted.
---
I'll try out a couple of these and see what I like best. The wire mesh idea looks most promising. Thank you for answering all my questions as I shamelessly pumped you and WulfyZef for tips for my next project.
---
That mesh looks like a good idea. I like how it turned out. Also, what type of clay and tools did you use for that hand? I am curious how you managed the dents in between the fingers. Also thank you so much for all these tips.
---
Theres:
---
-ghostly infu
---
-poly purple
---
-bee
---
-kodas
---
-mystic
---
-celestial
---
(And multiple of a few of them)
---
With the way you unlock especs in horizontal lines in pof, you could spread each spec over 3 releases.
---
Aren't there big restrictions on the "free" game that people who buy the game don't have? And does that mean that by buying an expac that it counts also as buying the core game at the same time?
---
I don't think that's a bug. The change affected many items which could reset as a result and istead of writing a script to fix that they notified the players that they might need to reselect stats on some items. In the blog they said "When this change goes live, many pieces of attribute-selectable gear will reset." "Many" not "all"
---
You can buy the plates for the dwarven tomb from the hp, I think that would be the fastest way to get jewels. As you get a lot fof rare unids back it's not that expensive.
---
You can get trinkets with diviner-stats from ls3 maps now too, but if you mean armor and weapons, I can't think of a good new way.
---
you have both committed the cardinal sin of wearing another professions armour (regardless of whether rev or warrior... or god forbid; guardian), fashion police dispatched; do not resist arrest
---
My post was mainly to post about the new version 0.12 being released
---
For curiosity what happened? My wife needs to do this still and itd be good to know in case we run into trouble
---
There are some restrictions on free accounts, however once you buy an expansion, doesn't matter which one, all those restrictions are lifted! I think the only real big difference between buying the core game all those years ago and free2play accounts buying an expansion is the amount of character slots they have as default.
---
Still not wheelchair accessible...
---
Also, apparently it makes bright hairstyles even brighter. Celestial hair color gets you lit up like fireworks the 4th of July. Gondor could call for aid with your head.
---
I'll have to try using that tool more. I never thought about carving away stuff after cooking it. I really appreciate the time you and Tis_Unfortunate have spent answering my questions.
---
No because just having CC without any dps/support is pointless. You can always take utility skills that are focused on CC though, if you absolutely need it (for certain world bosses for example), but it's not something that meta builds are really focused on.
---
NOOOOOO WHY DID YOU SAY SOMETHINNNNG
---
They gave some exceptions but I thought some things like living story trinkets and raid accessories would all be reset. Looks like I may be mistaken. But it is inconsistent, like I have many black ice bands. Some are reset and some are not.
---
I have 67 characters.
---
Exactly. I think OP mixed it up with the description of **Vision of Dragons: Aurene** in Jahai.
---
Yeah that would be great, I bet there is a ton of bloat because of everything it has to load.
---
Players being mercilessly scammed by npcs is a lovely tradition of this game at this point XD
---
I only picked the game back up a week ago so maybe it's a recent thing.
---
I don't think that they will do elite specs, and the only reason is that they would have to release them piecemeal and the whole community would be in an uproar because someone else's class got chosen before them.
---
However, it will be interesting to see what they will do because as far as we know they said they wouldn't keep doing new map every release necessarily so what extra will they do instead? Or does it just mean that the scope of the story will be bigger?
---
I mainly need it for the "If I may Interrupt" Achievement in Jahai. Where hard CC is needed and when everyone is not paying attention.
---
Did you buy all of those, or did you grind the gold out for the gems? Seems crazy to me to grind gold for gems, but probably because I'm not super advanced yet.
---
skyscale was the timegate. plus stuff from older episodes, but people that did those diligently when they came out could finish it very quickly after the patch. it's the same as aurora basically, if you completeed each episode including optional content, you had no timegate there either IIRC.
---
What music track is that? Also can  you reupload without it?
---
\*Drooburt smiles in the underworld\*
---
"Nice.."
---
No.
---
i got mine for 2.9k gold but so far i have seen them go between 4.5k-8k gold mostly. i guess i got lucky, for now \^\^
---
Build templates are confirmed.
---
np! it's all great questions :&gt;

---
~~There are male characters in this game?~~ Yeah it's like the eyes are turned 90 degrees or something, really weird. But hope it gets fixed soon
---
Dude on the right is a perfect example of why you don't skip leg day.
---
Not that one. The horrible one at the start.
---
PvE, though if you are into PvP there is that too, in two different formats(5 vs 5, and cross server battles taking castles and stuff).  Core game is free to play and you can do dungeons/fractals endgame content with a few restrictions to combat gold sellers.  Expansions are totally worth it for elite specs/gliding/mounts.
---
Yeah, but also we already know that we can get raids as a part of living world. I'm talking in terms of content that still is exclusive to expansion releases; i.e. it will come packaged with the release of the expansion and not at any other time. While we've gotten masteries, mounts, maps etc in living world, elite specs are the only big feature that hasn't come packaged with a living world update, which is why this is exciting, since it sets precedent for elite specs being released whenever the devs have them ready.
---
The basic version is available in form of F2P, which is limited in certain features (map chat access for example) but offers almost everything we had until first expansion was released. You can give it a try right away
---
I'm playing it for almost 7 years and for me the first best thing is that players work together - there's no PvP in open world (whole mode or actually modes are separated from PvE), no kill stealing, no fighting over carrots or ore. The second is that there are no classic fetch quests but dynamic scripted encounters instead that allows other players to participate and thus, working together. Also the fact that level cap wasn't raised and my gear is pretty much same all the time (sans the small changes like jumping from exotic to ascended tier). Not mention the combat and overall movement which feels pretty well done.
---
They are always there, but they get hidden when you look at them when not in Halloween.
---
The hiding sometimes fails for a split second, but never for long enough to use them.
---
The only issue with that is that I have no clue what I'm doing on each class.  I don't know what their strengths are or anything so I don't know WHAT to try on them.  I guess a better question would be what should I try for each class if I were to try all of them?
---
Are you running any addons that you haven't updated since last update? ArcDPS for example can do it to me sometimes.
---
You have just sold me on this.
---
[Crimson Tide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crimson_Tide) is still bugged. Instead of giving 2% life force per hit, it gives exactly 2 life force per hit.
---
that is excellent news for me :D
---
I just crafted 6 weapons, 5 on one character and 1 on another and I didn't get credit. They were all weapons I had not yet crafted, so I'm not sure what's going on with Vision of Equipment: Dragonsblood Weapons
---
In the context of high level pve:
---
Warrior: mainly used as a hybrid support dps with banners. Solid team buffs with ok damage. Other builds are kinda eh.
---
Guardian: my favorite. Amazing top tier burst with dps dragonhunter. Easy to pick up too. Supporting as hybrid firebrand or healing fb both require heavy situational awareness and knowledge, but has decent dps or amazing healing depending on the build, while still having amazing choices of utility. Used in high level fractals and can be used in power raids. Decent bursty condi fb build too.
---
Rev: power rev is nonexistent. Condi renegade is a close  second for best condi dps in the game. Support as alacrity ren is used in combination with quickbrand in fracs (aka firebrigade) and power bosses. Heal variant exists as well. Hard to learn class.
---
Ranger: druid as healer is outclassed by firebrigade in fracs. Still heavily used in raids. Easy to play. Slb is the meta class in fracs. Amazing dps, potential to buff team a little. medium difficulty.
---
Thief. Staff DD is amazing dps as well. Easiest rotation in the game. Good for fracs, amazing for raids. Boon thief build for 1 raid boss. Very niche. Rifle deadeye can only be played effectively on one raid boss. Condo thief is eh.
---
Engi: dps is a little under average, but still great to play. Power holo has great dps. Condi holo is an ok option. Don’t even consider scrapper.
---
Elementalist: weaver has the highest dps in the game with sword. Kinda low survivability, relies on support. Power tempest is better on some fracs for better bust or something Im not sure. Condi build is eh. Heal temp can be used as a secondary healer in niche cases.
---
Mesmer: chrono support is amazing in raids. Not so much in fracs. Hard to play. Power chrono can sometimes be used effectively. Condi mirage is the best condi build atm on almost all condi bosses.
---
Necro: a little under average dps but still ok. Power reaper has some self buffing and good dps. Heal scourge can be used as a second healer as a niche pick. Condi scourge is ok.
---
Remember to play power dps for power bosses, condi for condi. Check [snowcrows](snowcrows.com) for specific raid builds, [discretize ](discretize.eu) for fractal builds. 
---
Comp wise the meta is :
---
Fractals: firebrigade+2 Weaver+1slb or firebrigade+bs+Weaver+ Slb 
---
Power bosses: firebrigade, druid, chrono, bs, rest dps
---
Condi bosses: 2druid, 2 chrono, bs, rest dps
---
These are all OPTIMAL comps, so don’t worry about getting them perfect (like the power comp is only used by speedruners). Nice to use as a guide though.
---
Feel free to ask questions :D
---
I would really like to do works like this !  
---
Could you please spare some time and giving me some infos on the material neededs and so on ? Like...type of clay, a bit of the working process (without going too much into detail, like for example it if needs to be cooked etc) and useful tools ? thanks !  
---
Right not i was experimenting with a thermoplastic, but it's hard to make fine details with it, as the heating process tends to make the whole zone malleable. Still it's a pretty nice choice for less detailed stuff. Especially since it's also extremely sturdy xD
---
From an analytical point of view, ArenaNet has been trying to increase their revenue significantly after the lay-offs. We can see this due to:
---
* Significant increases in communications
---
* Re-introduction of week-long bonus events
---
* A more spread-out content cadence
---
* New and unique BLTC content
---
I think that they've decided to make Season 5 a filler season in the same vein as Season 2, 3 and 4 were. 
---
The reason for this is exactly due to their plans of increasing revenue. An expansion simply brings in a LOT more new players and a LOT more money. To give Season 5 huge, expansion-only reserved content would be a bad financial decision from their position because it would lesson the impact of an expansion significantly.
---
Things we're certainly not expect from season 5 are as follows:
---
* A huge amount of maps dropped all at once, akin to the release of HoT or PoF.
---
* Generation 3 elite specialisations.
---
* A new, huge mechanic (Personal Housing, a new crafting discipline, anything that has a huge amount of content, really.)
---
* A new playable race.  
---
Things we could expect from season 5, however, are the following:
---
* Super Adventure Box world 3 (and world 4 the year after, but the chance of them being released at once seems bigger)
---
* New types of novelties (similar to how Chairs were new)
---
* Extra content created from currently existing content (like a Bestiary in which you hunt/collect these beasts for information, a Library for collecting books and other readable items, in a similar vein to how they released the entire novelty collectionable aspect)
---
* More content in existing maps that are barely played, with the option of expanding existing maps to become bigger in size, with more content as well.
---
* Fractal and raid releases.
---
* PvP new game modes (like 2 V 2, maybe even Stronghold remake)
---
* WvW improvements like World Linking
---
* Legendary trinkets, runes and sigils
---
* Build Templates
---
* Cooking &amp; Jeweller to 500
---
I'm personally very excited for Season 5, since it has a lot more smaller tidbits of content that I'm more attracted to. Admittedly, gen 3 elite specs are probably the thing that will brings me back to the game for months on end, but I have the patience for them to finish something great.
---
We'll see what the future brings!
---
Honestly. I can't stress enough how amazing GW2's wiki has been made by the community. We are one of the largest gaming wiki (after WoW, which actually holds the record for being the single most populated wiki....) . As of now, I'm waiting for the amazing crew to update the Vision and Skyscale wiki pages with all the goodies. I have depended on them for ages. Wish I could contribute but unfortunately I'm a casual and I have 0 clue how to wiki so I wouldn't want to screw it up. 
---
Again, wiki people; thank you &lt;3

I do not know the percentages of exit of the objects. I believe the time has come to do other tests. XD
---
In therms of which classes are the easiest, necromancer and ranger are basically faceroll (ranger has better endgame potential). Guardian is also pretty easy and in a good place in terms of endgame. Other classes are normal, I guess. Mesmer is maybe a bit difficult if you're just starting out for the first time, so maybe avoid that and the elementalist and thief are probably the most difficult. In terms of endgame, every class has some niche, but not every class is good for everything.
---
What event was it? Wiki link?
---
You could give constructive criticism in a far more polite way, did it ever occur to you try that instead of being a massive dick and saying the art should be deleted because you don't like it
---
No friends sadly. Just randos and a ton of people who prefer to fail the event for the legendary trinket vision. Which is kind of annoying.
---
this is hilarious
---
I did it without even knowing it's an achi so I had just a normal build  meaning it's probably not very hard to get.
---
Try using holo with rifle (or shield), bomb+mortar kit (good hard and soft cc), battering ram, something like net turret, tool kit or similar CC on low cooldown. Make sure you trait as many of them for even shorter cooldown.
---
Wow, well done that looks stunning and so detailed, I could imagine you getting some commission work for some of these. &lt;3
---
Thanks for the guide. I just started this one today. I hear it's a bit of a long slog and have to have lot of the currencies. I have 3-400+ of the mistborn motes so far. Not sure about rest yet, but thanks again for the guide!
---
There is no onus on anybody to give constructive positive feedback, so i see no reason why i should have to give constructive criticism. If anything, a "wow the shading is shit" is better feedback than the hundreds of vapid "wow so cool :3" posts that get upvoted, as it at least tells the OP something valuable.
---
and you need 5 from thunderhead too. maybe you use your brain and understand that the currencies in istan and thunderhead keep are very easy to farm for everyone.
---
nobody suffers because other ppl played a map exstensively.
---
this comment is so much higher quality and more well-reasoned than my original post, so i think you're op now
---
&gt; I struggle to think what an expansion-like feature could possibly be implemented in a season that hasn't technically already been done. It's what makes me so curious about what they meant by that.
---
Raids, while technically released during season, are also technically gated by expansion access.
---
&gt; I won't be getting my hopes up in case it's less than what players would consider expansion-like.
---
Yes, Anet taught me to never hype and only care once I can play the content.
---
If they must split it up due to timing, a good way to handle it would be that all elite specs come out at once, but they only have a single traitline, with traitlines 2 and 3 unlocking on episode 3 and 6 (or even 2 and 3 if they can pull it off) respectively giving them time to balance/tune them out.
---
PoF paved the way for that by having traitlines unlock horizontally instead of vertically, so it could work as a last resort.
---
I didn’t know this existed, is there a page on the wiki?
---
There's always the odd feature they could add like fishing/expanding on their current book system. I don't think they need a new movement system when they can just add newer mounts? But yeah they'll probably add something like that.
---
Are you seriously telling me that you think it's intended for two of my Icebrood Horn Backpacks with the same stats and no infusion would have only one of them reset? [There is 0 consistency for which items reset.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bu3ygz/patch_bug_thread_28_may_2019/ep6nc4h/?st=jw9u537x&amp;sh=c3ae26b5)

Maybe you're on the right end of variance, friend.

It has thief, PvE focused game though it has both

&gt; That aside, maybe they've figured out a way to deal with all the complications of adding a new race and that's what we'd get. 
---
Tengu are the #1 candidate for a new race. They got a city next to a starting area, they already use charr animations, they were in the works originally anyway, they are the only race unique enough to actually stand out and be combat able, and their city is just sitting there in the middle of the map waiting to be explored.
---
Does it stack with winters heart?
---
Your performance is roughly equivalent to what ai can achieve... 
---
Is that impressive or sad? I can't decide
---
Unequip?
---
I don't think a new book/fishing system will be a big draw for players even remotely as much as mounts and gliding is.
---
You want each expansion to be more impressive than the last, not less.
---
A brand new shinny system that's as groundbreaking as gliding and mounts is the best way to impress existing and potential players into joining/staying.
---
didnt know there could be bots doin it, but now it all makes sense. Explains most of the matches i tried to do before i stopped playing for a few months, sux since that was my main way to do the daily stuff
---
That’s what I run, since goe is gone I put in stone spirit too
---
What build templates? There's a mod for build templates?
---
Tbh the current purple one looks more like monk blue
---
Correct. I made these routes while ago so no need to update:-)
---
I hope the achievement time window is larger than the first time around.  The mithril event ended before I even got home from work.
---
Its an awesome concept instead of adding the recipes they are involving the community
---
That's really cool! Only a bit sad it won't be announced a bit prior (not what items are needed, but when it goes live).
---
I really like the idea of this, though! Great work! :)
---
Lws1 is gone!!! We go from punching Zhaitian to suddenly being in Brisban for no reason with character we dont know who we are suppose to be connected too!!
---
Wait so if you work for a living you're SOL on the achievement? Yikes..

&gt;- Fixed an issue in which events related to the Vision legendary trinket collection could consume Memory Essence Encapsulators from players&amp;#39; inventories, even when they&amp;#39;ve already received progress from those events.
---
&gt;- Fixed a bug that caused attribute-selected Harrier&amp;#39;s armor and weapons to have extra stats.
---
&gt; ~~involving the community~~ sinking mats from the economy
---
FTFY
---
I'm still updating it (so double check the items first) but there are good options in [this section of the guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character#Viper.2FHarrier.2FDiviner_Armor). 
---
&gt;Is there now an easier/different option to get/craft Diviner's gear
---
Even before the patch season 3 trinkets gave diviner stats as an option and now you have the extra exotic stat selectable gear mentioned above.
---
&gt;I have an ascended chest piece I want to convert to Diviner's
---
Only way to [stat change](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) ascended armor is to use the [exotic insignia](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Diviner%27s_Intricate_Gossamer_Insignia) and that uses the jewels.
---
&gt;are there any easier ways to get stat selectable Diviner's that wasn't possible before
---
Fractal armor chests now select from the larger stat lists of assaulter, defender, healer, and malicious. Some of the harder collections got stat selections, you can check the guide for other options.
---
same here
---
&gt; For the achievement hunters among you, you'll be able to earn the related achievements throughout the event series, so don't worry if you didn't get it the first time--you'll have more chances!
---
This feels pretty bad, TBH.  If it gets completed as eagerly and quickly as the first time then it will be really annoying to try to participate without taking off of work.
---
I sincerely hope that once they are done with the series they allow some way to still get the achievements afterwards (by sinking some of the relevant mats even if it doesn’t progress the community event).
---
Agreed, I think it was roughly four hours or so?
---
&gt;  For the achievement hunters among you, you'll be able to earn the related achievements throughout the event series, so don't worry if you didn't get it the first time--you'll have more chances!
---
I'm sure you didn't miss out.
---
It does involve the community. Also people are always complaining there are no sinks for materials bar the zephyr sanctum. Anet add a mat sink and its a bad thing somehow.
---
A return to limited time bullshit that will exclude some players. This is a step backwards.
---
Agreed. But at the same time, they've made gemstones such a gigantic gold sink necessary for legendaries (which I'm sure is a big part of why people gold farm to begin with), so there will always be that subsect of people searching out metas simply for gemstones. I think thematic skins, etc. Are a grand idea, but given the way that they have chosen to release most skins lately (massive material sinks), it may be more incentivizing for them to add things to the market that don't have many current avenues, but are necessary for things like legendaries. For example, mystic coins and gemstones. And if they were able to do that on a rotation, I think it would better incentivize people to run content like Orr maps or lesser visited living world maps. Potentially adding a special currency you can accumulate to unlock skins, etc. Something akin to black lion statuettes, perhaps.
---
Dragonfall 8 mistmotes, a shadow companion and something else I dunt recall
---
I mean that's nice but if the event always starts after a patch then people who work are still screwed.
---
The amount of people complaining probably isn’t more than the people who hate may sinks like this.
---
I assume they'd make it so that you can save gear sets, but they'd still need to be in your inventory in order to swap between them
---
I meant that as in it acts like a mystic forge stone, not that it is, sorry that I was not clear enough about that.
---
You can get currency from the renown hearts jfc calm down
---
Nah i rather destroy 10 Queen Bees one being a glitched item so they all 10 stacks 2 chak egg sacs and 6 aurillium infusions 2 confettis. Then giving a casual pleb like you 1 copper.
---
Invading Awakened is a thing at least. Maybe the underground vault ghost bosses that no one does? But ya not a whole lot in that zone besides a couple people waiting outside AC.
---
other than maps and maayyybe a new playable race or 2, they could add new weapons or tie a set of masteries to learning skills used by lesser races
---
Looks like an F-15 doing a flyby of the pyramids.
---
Then again, the loading screen for Crystal Oasis, the statue in the top left corner has a penis as well, if you were asking me.
---
Can't say I've seen it block stuff from behind, outside of the initial Aegis you get for activating the skill. In regard to AoEs, if you face the center of it you'll block it.
---
[It can be both.](https://i.imgur.com/WXfuedi.gif)
---
I did a quick controlf on that page, but templates are only offhandedly mentioned in the patch notes, how do you get the templates addon? Also, I can't figure out where the download for the base plugin is?
---
so what is the recipe for this?
---
it just ended so fast, because ppl wanted to know what it is. next time it wont be so fast.
---
Can you link me, or just explain what you're doing with that?
---
oh.... yea... the mount version doesnt even seem to have the same color as the chair version... i had to dye it with ASH
---
? they look awesome
---
I like the idea but I don't like the idea of this being a material dump. The community *lost their mind* with this event and mithril rose in price so drastically with no real reason or purpose. Having this happen again with other mats over the next few weeks will just be insanity for no reason.
---
I might just grab it today or this weekend. I’m getting level 80 soon. And don’t want to skip the story. But we’ll see.
---
Did you even read his comment, or are you that ignorant? He didn't say he has 0 time, he said he couldn't do this event that lasted only for a few hours, because it was live during his working time. Of course a LOT of people will miss an event if it's THAT short.
---
I think you underestimate the community's desire to unlock skins.
---
Very bottom of the page, says download x64 current,from there the main DLL is in that folder, and the build templates is in a labeled subfolder.
---
iirc one of the other addons (under extras) does stuff like remove the green personal story tracker, or used to I haven't used it in a while so dunno if anything changed lol
---
Dulfy went inactive? I've lost proper internet so I'm about a month out of the loop for gw2 stuff.
---
It was just a hobo npc by the mystic forge begging for mithril donations and for some reason people donated thousands and expected something decent in return
---
The ring alone would probably be the default aurora effect. Then it would get the current effect when equipped with a second leggy trink and yhe effect shown above when all three are equipped
---
I think this thread needs a campaign to get it more attention, heh.
---
Be more specific.  What are you running? Power? Condition? .. Hybrid? 
---
Best link a build or fill out a [GW2Skills template.](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/)
---
So... as someone rather new to the game, what does Vulkan(hadn't heard of it till now) does differently than directx? Why are there people using it instead? How's is it better?
---
What happened to her site? She just doesn't do gw2 anymore?
---
Keep in mind that the story order goes:
---
* Personal story
---
* Season 1 - no longer playable, [recap options here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Story_Recap)
---
* Season 2 - gem store purchase, only really worth it for the story (can join someone that has it without owning it)
---
* Heart of Thorns - first expansion
---
* Season 3 - gem store purchase, 6 new maps, good ways to get gear
---
* Path of Fire - second expansion
---
* Season 4 - any episodes you logged in for will be unlocked for free including latest one episode 6, rest of them gem store
---
Oh right. Duh. Gimme a few minutes lol
---
Disgusting luck
---
He updated it many hours ago
---
arc here: https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/x64/
---
templates addon here: https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/x64/buildtemplates/
---
Grab the .dll files and place them in your bin64 directory where your gw2.exe is.
---
That's it, handy shortcuts to know are alt + shift + T, alt + shift + H and alt + shift + D.
---
Alt + shift + T will bring up the settings ui panel.
---
Alt + shift + H will toggle all arc window visibility.
---
Alt + shift + D will toggle build template ui. 
---
If you can't see any arc UI, try alt + shift + H. If you still can't see anything try alt + shift + T.
---
If it's still not showing, try this combo with alt shift pressed: T, H, T, H.
