Thank you so much!! I feel really happy that you like it :D

Dont get hyped up, Arenanet always disappoints.

Thank you!! :)

I think druid as a spec is way too tailored to healing to make good use of it. A boonbeast build would probably be better.
---
you cant just call your own impressions facts, thats not how facts work
---
besides thats just what i said, they take significantly longer for inexperienced groups. decent groups currently blow through encounters whether theres mechanics or not

Servers only matter for WvW.  Servers are completely merged for PvE and PvP; and that includes the LFG.
---
Hi! You can find more of my artwork [here](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Elfenschein). Someone already bought the shown flower light sculpture though, so I can only offer to craft something similar again :O
---
Thank you so much!! :)
---
Maybe you can try megai2´s d912pxy(you can find a thread of it if you scroll back a bit), heard its a little unstable since its a pretty new stuff but on the other hand it can skyrocket performance for some. The game will run on low settings without this anyway, but maybe for raids and WvW you can try it if it gives you a more smooth experience.
---
GL!
---
Auric Basin is the prettiest map in the game, by far.  I love it there.  Nothing in PoF or LWS 3/4 compares.
---
My favourite part is that the boss spawns right on top of you after you barely manage to retrieve a chest or hold out against the ghost assault. Not even a single second to get out of combat and get a hold of yourself. Who needs that anyways? This fractal doesn't waste time! /s
---
Yes :) You can find me [here](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Elfenschein)
---
That's fantastic. How long did it take you from concept to completion?
---
My pleasure! Glad you like it, was a really fun piece to work on (:
---
Not complaining, thought it was kind of funny.
---
you just cut the devtime by about a month because anet will now just do the same. kappa
---
Damn, there was only one RIBA group running the time I played yesterday, so that one group is the only one in the whole of America region? Thanks for the explanation 
---
ESO pushes out DLC packs not content.

Well, they aren't a raid boss for a start. It's an event like spirit run or river road. But each of those individual statues would make for a much more interesting encounter were they elevated to raid boss status. Out of all of the single encounter traditional raid bosses, CA is by far the least interesting to me and it's very boring to fight. Even Cairn and Mo are more fun.
---
There has been a lot of interesting comments regarding the uncertain future of the next expansion.  Personally I hope the next expansion has not been cancelled.  
---
I’ve been playing MMOs for more than 10 years now and I’ve yet to see an MMO that has moved away from the expansion business model and survived.  Generally what happens is the developers say “we’re moving away from expansions to focus on more frequent updates”.  What actually happens is a reduction in the overall quality/complexity of updates and a reduction in bug fixes.  I’ve always suspected that “moving away from the expansion business model” is a cost saving exercise to cope with a reduced amount of developers.  
---
I actually have around 7-8 years’ experience in the software development industry.  Big, “project sized” updates (like an expansion) are really important for the overall longevity for a piece of software.  From a release management perspective, it is really hard to add big new features and/or fix legacy issues in a smaller release schedule.  Typically it is the testing side of things that take up the most amount of time, which is why it is best to manage things as a proper, large scale project (ideally using an Agile methodology).  When a big update is “done right”, the user base see the software as something brand new which in turn brings the software “back into the spot light”.  When you don’t do big updates, you’ll typically see comments like “I did not know people still used that software”.  
---
In all honesty, I think ANET needs to move away from the Living Story business model.  The original version of the Living Story, used for Season 1 didn’t work.  I don’t think the second version of the Living Story used for Seasons 2 – 4 is sustainable (also causes a lot of confusion amongst new users).  I’d much rather see an increased focus on expansions that add exciting new features that attract new players (which is the lifeblood of an MMO).  The Living Story could be reworked into “post expansion updates”.  Buying an expansion would automatically get you access to the “post expansion updates.  The past Living Story episodes could be bundled in with Heart of Thorns and Path of Fire to keep things consistent with the new business model.  
---
LWs6 is first. We're more than a year away from the next paid expansion.
---
Only one tagged up and in LFG at that exact moment, yes. Depending on when you play and what content you're looking for it changes a lot.
---
Thank you!! I'm glad you like it :)
---
Confusion is much stronger in PvE balanced instances, so much so that the difference is staggering, and while the tournament will take place in the guild hall, organizers thought it would be much fairer to limit it to 2 mallyx revs so that the Banish Enchantment spam doesnt get obnoxious. I think.
---
[removed]
---
Bullshit, SR is actually isn't any longer than most of usual t4s and goes under 10 minutes. Unless you die on every phase of a final encounter ofc. 
---
And stupid (apparently actually fucking stupid) pve players that need 45+ minutes on each fractal should stay and learn on lower tiers. Hows that for an idea.
---
Well a couple of years ago we had Rythlock showing up in Masters x Masters during his time in the Mist but that was another NCsoft IP (now defunct). There was nothing on GW2's side though. 
---
And a long time ago, the Aion cross-promotion, that added exclusive Aion wing emote in GW1.
---
Except for that ArenaNet and marketing or cross-marketing... not their strongest point. But yeah hunting down some of GW2 largest and most vicious predators would be fun I guess.
---
It takes longer to get up to speed, but from the data it is faster. I can upload some data if you want!
---
That is Nonsense if you play your core build  with a little bit of research you are as good as 90% of all players. I play a Frikkin Minion Necro somethimes in Fractal and still get more damage out tahn most other players because i KNOW  my class. The whole UUUHHH IF YOU DONT PLAY META YOU ARE A BURDEN is made up by people who dont know how to play their own classes good enough.
---
I love that stuff. The only place in town that sells them has run out of my fave... Gotta go exploring to find more lol
---
Not really the best condition class. It's just really good at bosses who have lots of attacks( cause confusion spam) other bosses with long phases have other condi classes who do more damage than a mirrage
---
I was hoping these would be sized to scale.
---
yeah now we all definitely know they're being sarcastic.
---
Not having any issues with surviving, at least not yet. I do feel like my DPS is low compared to watching other classes kill the same mobs as me. Still trying to figure out conditions and how to use them to my advantage on this toon. On my ranger I just healed through the ones that hurt and ignored the rest, LOL! Thanks for the info!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I wish they sold panties in this game like black desert. I'd buy some in-game lingerie for 30$ if it gave me a bit of magic find. :^)
---
There is one thing which I I really do miss from other MMOs (such as .... yes, WoW) and that is the very low drop rate of some particular item, mount, etc from certain monsters. I know there are many players in GW2 who are allergic to the rng involved in that sort of thing, but on the flip side, we’ve become more and more accustomed to special and unique items generally coming from the gem shop.  I miss the subtle chance of those unique drops - it would be, in many cases, enough of a motivator to do a lot of these types of content.
---
Okay, I’m glad I’m not the only one who thought about this.
---
Chrono tank and off chrono are both support/condition chrono that momoa1999 mentioned. They're the same thing except the tank has 1 more toughness stat than the other chrono (boss aggro is determined by toughness for some of the encounters) and needs to know how to position the boss. (ie off chrono needs to just give quick/ala/dps while tank chrono needs to know how to position the boss in addition to quick/ala/dps) Support chrono gives quickness/alacrity while doing power damage while the conditon chrono gives quickness/alacrity while doing condition damage(it's only used on Largos, Soulless Horror and Matthias so just worry about the support chrono or just refer to the Snow Crows website like others have suggested). 
---
momoa1999 mentioned power chrono because you can't use condi mirage everywhere. Mirage is good on condition fights but some fights heavily favor power and because power mirage can't compete well he mentioned power chronomancer. 
---
Read up on what Nizzywizz has to say about it then go look up the snow crows website again. They cover it extensively. Don't say you understand something when it's clear you haven't even ingested the content properly. momoa1999 literally linked how each of the builds fare on every encounter and you choose to overlook that because it wasn't an easy answer of "yes mirage works everywhere no matter what".
---
Good luck with playing mesmer. There's going to be a balance patch next tuesday so I'd hold off on gearing your mesmer  (if you haven't started it yet) for now so you don't waste gold on having to stat changing your gear.
---
Marauder's gear is from HoT? I'm surprised about that.
---
Either bad luck, bad timing, or you’re not looking often enough. The past seven days at 11-1pm EST NA there are a couple of guilds that did a t4 run if VB. Maybe go into the map too because I think I ran into one or two that weren’t on an lfg. 
---
"I wonder if they plan on introducing expansion-level features into the release of Season 5, like new elite specs or another gameplay revamping feature like mounts or gliders.
---
They are! :-)
---
Mike: But now we're raising the stakes and we're actually starting to release what we'd consider expansion-level features, alongside these things, when they come online, when they're ready.
---
We're not saving things for big expansions anymore. These things come online when they're ready and we're going to keep releasing them."
---
They probably dont intend to release an expansion. maybe not soon. looks like they gonna try a living world + expansion model
---
You have to purchase the recipe for the inscription from the vendor next to the crafting station.  Then make an inscription, make the base pieces of whatever armor piece you're trying to craft, and then in the discovery tab, put the inscription and two armor components together to craft a complete armor piece.
---
Instanced content doesn't compare to WoW, but the combat and movement is fluid and the graphics are better.
---
This is so much clearer than anything I have read on the internet. Thank you.
---
Sort of. The base game is free, but there are two paid expansions (can get both for like $50). Until you get to level 80 you really don’t need the expansions to enjoy the content.  Even after that you could theoretically do stuff without them, since they don’t increase max level or drop “better” gear, just progress the story and give you access to new features. 
---
Levelling is also quite fast (I started playing again two weeks ago, started a new character, and he’s level 78 right now). Granted I had some time off but still, but my longest day was like... 5 hours of playing. Average was probably an hour or two. 
---
Thanks for confirming my theory, You have my down vote as well.
---
The one piece of advice I'd give is don't play this like you would World of Warcraft. Unless all you care about is end game content or PVP, take your time and explore the world. Everything (fighting, exploring, crafting, mining, etc) gives you XP, so you'll always be making progress. 
---
The world map is fairly large, they've also been adding a new zone every 3 months or so with each content release.
---
You can definitely play with friends in every part of the game (story instances, dungeons, fractals, PVP, raids, open world PVE).
---
I'm using double-staff build for my mirage and have gone all the way from T1 to T3 without much difficulty. Actually I think staff mirage gives you much better survivabiliy from chaos armor, mirage mantle from traits (cause you don't have to choose the axe trait), and just being a ranged DPS, although you'll have a longer ramp-up time and deals a little less damage than axe mirage. Currently I can hit 13k+ DPS doing fractals with my staff mirage without a support in the group, I think it can contribute enought DPS for the group and at the same time can be quite useful in some quite messy boss fights because you can cope with the mechanics more smoothly and not die so often.
---
Kind of.  As far as I can tell, anyone can craft it-it's technically a core stat set.  But it came out at HoT launch, and the stuff you make with it is always account bound.
---
I am really confused here, how can you possible say that from one post?  What a stupid thing you say "Mate"
---
No problem! Sometimes the wiki can be a bit unclear, GW2's crafting is really weird and unintuitive at first until you really get the hang of it.
---
This is a fair question, why do you have to insult me?
---
I got 2 black lion key drops in the last month.... someone in map chat pointed out that it was either that or a pre, which was depressing. 
---
Give this user a cookie :)
---
Unless I am mistaken, it just dumps it straight to your bank which has limited inventory or am I wrong?
---
So after the initial release, the earnings seem more or less consistent. Though I'm happy to see that it's not a downward trend. One would hope for an upward trend. Oh well. As long as the train keeps rolling.
---
It's totally fine. Mentioned situation got cleared.
---
Think this way: If sending gold to someone would be bannable, there wouldn't be an option to mail someone gold.
---
&gt;Cauterizing Fire: While attuned to fire, gain immunity to chill and convert a damaging condition into burning with every passing second, take 50% reduced damage from Burning.
---
because the old diamond skin wasn't bad enough
---
Crafting materials have a specific tab in your bank in which you can deposit 250 of each material and can be expanded with gemstore items. 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Material_storage
---
These and awesome. Too bad we don't have them in game.
---
You're both talking about the same functionality in different ways. They want to be able to bind hotkeys to use an item especially for shared inventory slots.
---
I am more in favor of that implementation than having more UI on my screen. I love how simple the UI is now and I would hate having an extra bar just for consumables. 
---
To add to this, the core game already features a lot of content for level 80 characters. The expansions consist entirely of level 80 content.
---
A big benefit of GW2 is that you never truly "outlevel" zones, as your character level always scales down to whichever zone you are in. That way, you can continue to do content in low level areas (nearly all "endgame" world bosses, which attract huge numbers of players and drop decent loot, are in non-level 80 zones) without it being trivial.
---
Balance patch announcement will be, uh, next week maybe. Or the week after. And a week after whenever that is, there will be a balance patch. Maybe.
---
We can say though. Because if the new players we got were greater than the players we lost then PoF would have been a lot more like HoT's. Since it wasn't, and was an obvious course correction then we can know that we lost far more players than we gained.
---
Iorc luck can be used in a few scribe recipes? Other than that, no.
---
First of all, impressive write up. Gotta respect the time and effort you put into it. 
---
Also it's 3 AM and I'm on mobile so I hope my post will be somewhat decent. 
---
**Earth** 
---
  - **Executioner**: Earth weapon skills deal 2% increased damage for each % of the target's missing health.
---
Bruh.
---
If I understand correctly, at 75% target health you deal 50% (2*25) more damage
---
At 50% target health you deal 100% more damage.
---
At 25% target health you get 150% more damage with Earth weapon skills.
---
That is just a metric ton of free passive damage. 
---
Did I miss a line regarding a base decrease in damage for Earth weapon skill (in order to create a bigger ramping up effect over time where you start with low damage and as the target loses health it gets better and better)? If so, wouldn't that be redundant with the way condition damage itsef has to ramp up over time? 
---
That would make staring a fight in Earth very unappealing in terms of damage. Of course it is just speculation based on what I understand and imagine you are trying to go for. 
---
Out of curiosity, when you say "earth weapons skills damage, does that also include the condition damage of the skills? (bleeding mostly) 
---
I see a lot of good and creative ideas in your write up (although one could find certain concepts debatable from a design standpoint) but I think you shouldn't try to get exact numbers for now as it might hurt the credibility of your design and the quality of the feedback you receive: people, will nitpick and argue over balancing values rather than discussing the concepts and mechanics themselves.
---
Yes if you add every single thing POF has more content (although ESO has 2 xpacs for every 1 GW2 xpac) but ESO content is more consistently produced and on time, you know what you're going to get and it gives ZOS more consistent revenue.
---
Plus I will note that following:
---
I have spent more time in Summerset than in POF areas.
---
Mounts have barely changed the actual game for me. 
---
The Psijic skill line came with actual quests.
---
Thank god, my inventory is now free.
---
Still RIP to all those materials I destroyed before finding that out.
---
Holy crap that's amazing!
---
/u/primordialtrade I second OP's sentiment. You have an incredible style. I adore everything about this. Rough and artistic in places, sharp and detailed in others. And the lighting/colors have so much life in them despite being a very dark outfit.
---
Keep doing you thing, man! Looks great!
---
What we had was bad publicity because of a VERY noisy segment of the population which was bad for business. I'm pretty sure more people currently play HoT than PoF.  And people have complaints about POF based on how different it is than HoT.
---
Your judgement on this is based at least in part on how much you disliked HoT. But I like both expansions and I'm relatively sure that HoT ended up being more replayable/popular over all. 
---
The  hot metas are more entertaining to people than bounties for example.
---
Let's not forget that mounts themselves are a huge part of the reason people bought POF and you can't tell if the expansion is better because it did better financially.
---
Not to mention several blunders Anet made before HoT lauched the had the community up in arms.
---
There's  a lot more to this equation than just more people less people. You simply can't tell.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
jackal should be fastest at 625 u/s ... well maybe can't, ever seem to get a stable speed reading for beetle
---
I agree, there's lots of cool ideas, but there's also some that I didn't like/had other ideas that have similar role. 
---
Some trait numbers and additional skills seem a bit too much though. 
---
WvW might be a problem little bit particularly in a blob fight since i m also using laptop with a little higher spec (i7, 8 gb ram, 930m). Also fps drops in pvp when team fight happened, otherwise i am fine (with graphic setting set to lowest).
---
Does every lws3 map have its own associated ascended backpack collection? Like wayfarers henge for Draconic mons and relic of abaddon for sirens landing?
---
I wonder what's wrong with your brain. 
---
&gt;It's clear you enjoy gimmicks and have no interest in healthy gameplay, counterplay or design.
---
WvW is itself a massive gimmick lmao. You just whine about everything like the entitled WvWer you are. Stop fucking playing instead of whining about everything because your gamemode is literally not important in the slightest to anyone. Was that way from the beginning: a side thing. Not a main thing. But you can't see that, because you're so scared of being exposed as the fraud you are.
---
&gt; noone with a bit of sense is really that much agaisnt it 
---
I mean the game needs rewards. The reason to go into the dungeon and slay the dragon at the end is to get the treasure. Yes the gem store needs to make money, but getting 1-5 APs and two blues and a green isn't working. Games need rewards that can be earned in game. It doesn't have to be this chair, but right now GW2 has a big rewards problem.
---
Also, they need to kill that incredibly uncomfortable posture across all chairs that have it, and come up with something better.
---
&gt;Compared with just using a Druid and a true DPS build, the opportunity cost of a non-Druid healer and offensive might share is too high. Druid remains an outlier that should be reigned in and balanced properly, along with Warrior.
---
This is why clearly fractal compositions no longer use druids: it's too strong obviously
---
You can alt-click on the map to do single 'personal waypoints', if that's what your looking for.
---
&gt; I think they could have some bigger thing planned for 2020.
---
You really think this? Based on what?
---
Top marathon runners maintain around 20 km/h on average. 7.5 m/s is 27 km/h so for shorter distances that seems reasonable, it's not like you often run 2 hours straight in the game.
---
Wearing armor though makes it a bit more impressive :D
---
Yeah, it's [this one](https://youtu.be/d17gwV4vXOg)
---
Exactly.
---
If it is a finished item you should either sell or salvage them.
---
&gt; \- LWS3 sucked a$$ 
---
I really liked LS3, though mainly because it gives me easy access to ascended stuff.
---
If you value your sanity have everyone gear a a different support toon so you can switch off and let others big balls dps sometimes.  I have a chrono and a Druid geared for that very reason and I’m working on a renegade right now
---
How about you bring up real points instead of sarcastic vitriol.  He said the opportunity cost of a comp using a DPS to might stack compared to a Druid doing it is too high, not that there shouldn't be an opportunity cost.
---
Maybe he's wrong, but unless you want to say why and how he's wrong and provide examples, you're offering nothing to the community and just sound like a cunt.  Learn to present your counterpoint better.
---
Oh, wow. I'm glad you stuck with it! The final product turned out great. Beyond great, actually. I love it. Very well done!
---
I think the expansion team is working o living world season 1 so thats why we are getting season 5 before an expansion.
---
yeah his face looks like a pancake
---
how can you fuck up a dragon...
---
&gt;the commanders were usually WvW players ( i dont know exactly why they were there)
---
they were bored of their own matchup or learning how to command :P
---
back when I was learning how to command I definitely went to eotm to get some easy bags. It's good at teaching you how to read the map and basic tactics since it's basically unorganised pugs vs unorganised pugs compared to proper wvw where you and your unorganised pugs would often run into experienced guild groups.
---
tbh I preferred commanding in eotm over proper wvw because unlike people in proper wvw, people in eotm actually knew how to stack and read chat for instructions. People in proper wvw often refuse to go into voice comms and yet they also ignore chat.
---
Exactly the reason didn't bought the expanions.
---
Wheb i heard first about GW2 i heard about gow aweseome it is to play content and get loot. And you had lots of armor pieces that can match with a lot of other armor pieces. 
---
I had such a blast for over 200 hours with the main game and before the first expansion was announced o saw that they would rather make a new outfit in gem store than adding new armors to the game. I really don't enjoy buying the skins, especially when there's morw outfits rather than armor pieces that you can do different sets.
---
And even then buying from the gem shop instead of having new content with new drops killed the game for me. I really miss playing the game, but as it is now is expensive for me to get back just to see that the end game is the gem shop...
---
Essentially yes, whenever we need to kill the next dragon. We might even get in a very tight spot just so full grown Aurene can swoop down from the skies and help us out. I really don't see a "better" way to write her of without it being cheesy "I know you have to go" type of talk or killing her off, when the work of many years with her goes down the drain just for a new Deus Ex Machina by Taimi. 
---
&gt; Backpacks are closer relatives to weapons than to armor (which is why we can't dye them)
---
&gt; 
---
It's why we cannot see then in character select, but I doubt that's why we cannot dye them. Otherwise, we should be able to dye the aquabreather fine. :P
---
oh i saw the same message in my instance. but i just kept killing and suddenly he spawned and people joined in to defeat him. hopefully this will work for you as well though  
---
depends a bit on the class, but 30% is an exaggeration. Also honestly it's not a big deal unless you plan on doing endless 99 and 100 CM speed runs on the regular. And even then you can still do them if you know the mechanics and your group is competent.
---
Looks like there not running the same graphics settings. 
---
Since I'm still currently playing BnS, the drop in sales for the most part was a generally un-welcomed patch released that broke many classes and there was many korean and chinese players that quit. As for our own version, they decided to hold back on releasing this, but it is getting stagnant as we wait for the next raid to come out this year and watch people blow through their wallets to clear it. 
---
Any reasonable person can see if you want money just pump out mobile games and let the remaining mmos go to server shut down once people stop spending money on them. 
---
The expacs regularly go on sale for like $10-15 USD. Sometimes you can get both for like $25 USD.
---
That being said, there's plenty to enjoy even without expacs, we've been getting more and more F2P recruits in my guilds and they are having fun without expacs
---
I killed Immelhoof about a week ago. I usually do a short Leather Farm as a part of my daily routine and for it I look for a lfg group. I'd like to assume that whenever a noticeable amount of ppl gather in the same instance, new one is created. So try to camp lfg a bit to see when a large'ish leather farm group is up and then get into lake doric. 
---
I see, that makes sense.
---
neat
---
maybe a blue neon color would have help with the glow of the flowers
---
On a slightly unrelated note, what's rifle is this? It looks gorgeous. Art itself is beautiful too. 
---
Sure! My commissions are open, just PM if you're interested (:
---
so sad that the feature in the game industry are mobile games... but yeah you can just simply rip off your player base much easier on that platform, while you get away with way less investment in content and quality on these games...
---
XD
---
Pretty sure that's light armor too so maybe Pistol Necro? @^@
---
They probably meant Aurene.
---
Spoiler time is over.
---
unranked Queue is anything but competitive. People test builds, run it for dailies, run classes they dont main or play in groups bigger than duos. You dont risk rating loss and dont gain any either, and as such it's more loose and relaxed, and should be taken as such. 
---
My point is: don't take it to heart. Unranked queue is nothing to be taken so seriously. The "serious, competitive" queue is ranked after all. 
---
Maybe near future. Maybe never. Search function would have helped you easily, but why do sth yourself when you get everything catered
---
If it happen I deeply hope its a hard fight unlike mordremoth DS fight
---
Exactly! The Korean mmo style, Inused to love gw2 because it didn’t contain this clown fiesta, not anymore... pvp is almost dead with terrible punishment system, fractals became boring, crafting doesn’t exist except for the legs, just nothing fun to do
---
Rytlock has had a pistol since beta but warriors still can't use them. Npcs don't follow player classes. 
---
phasing in this context is a specific term that means that every player gets their own version of a map based on story progress - for example, a green and growing orr for a player that finished the story, the opposite for one that did not. 
---
Totally different from phasing out old content in order to create new stuff, but it's one of those weirdly specific MMO terms.

Let's get banned together!
---
you managed to make a drake cute :)
---
Doesn't seems bad to me, but they should really go for more features and better microtransaction deals.
---
Speaking as a daily player here since Gw1 and 2 beta...
---
PvP is indeed toxic. Most hyper competitive games have toxic players this is nothing new. Spawn camping is also a strategy if the enemy team refuses to come out and feed that’s on them as well. 
---
Keep in mind that that each game is set to last 15 mins you should be okay with playing a game of that length the moment you queue up. You should be okay with the idea of playing those 15 mins. 
---
💀💀💀
---
It’s on a timer they created the technology to do changes without a patch.

That's good to know, I didn't know about that. Thanks!

Used for a repeatable achi pluss people investing and indtarelisting and people just unloading their opening loot at higher price point

Money invested and time spent doesn't have any correlation to the quality of raids. I don't follow your point, sorry.

Welcome to Tyria. My advice, change the roll action, from double tapping a movement key to a specific key. Save yourself a lot of headache later on.

2.5 ???? Wat
---
Probably talking about weight types. (Heavy, light and medium)
---
Some people refer to the shard based legendaries (eureka, pharus, binding of ipos, etc.) as generation 2.5, while the collection based ones that came out with the expansions (astralaria, chuka and champawat) as generation 2
---
Gen 2.5 are what the gen 2 legendaries are referred to that were added with the living stories and just requires a lot of crafting, no collections.
---
OP is Traikill, the one with the drake. Wuff doesn't have reddit ;3
---
Druid can maintain full Might and the necessary Ranger-unique buffs without any real detrimental impact to their healing which is already more than enough to solo heal every encounter that allows solo healing.
---
Also, what has the fractal meta got to do with scenarios of 25 might over 10 people?
---
Wuff outdid herself, like, group photos is such a scary task. GOOD JOB WUFF

---
Spawn camping for a whole match is toxic.
---
1. If you do sPvP or WvW reward tracks, you can get easy access to any stats on an exotic piece.
---
2. If you want to go the ascended route, you can start by doing low level fractals, get some asc trinkets, put AR on it, then climb higher the fractal tiers until you can get a full set of ascended from fractals.
---
3. I have a Harrier/Minstrel healing firebrand that works reasonably well in fractals. The main issue is that inexperienced people even to this day still think that running away from allies when low on health is a good idea. But other than that I have had no issues healing people through T4 dailies.
---
4. Unfortunately, harrier/minstrel will leave you somewhat screwed in the open world because you do very little damage on your own.
---
5. If you want to be an effective solo healer, you pretty much have to abandon hope of doing decent damage on your own. However if you just want to be a boons-bot or a secondary healer, you can still do decent damage solo.
---
This wiki page might help with stat selection.

---
Everytime I opened envelopes I kept an eye on my magic find indicator. Open all is by far not fast enough to open before the counter drops from 1112 to 962. 
---
BUT! Major but. The game might be coded that the magic find is measured from the moment of selecting open all, not the total runtime. I didn't take the risk and made my own macro.
---
Your result is either very lucky or it 'remembers' the magic find. I expect that you are right. I might test this with unid blue gear to save myself some tears if I want to try the envelopes again another year.
---
Surely if you have already made a gen 2, it's going to be cheaper to craft a gen 1 as your second and skin it as gen 2??
---
I already mentioned that the gen 1s are cheaper. Im just asking about the collection precursors.
---
Spawn camping is absolutelly normal in pvp... I dont know how is this news for anyone. You lost because you let them play by their rules, which is ok by itself
---
From what I've read, a range unit is "essentially" equal to an inch, not exactly equal.
---
Quick and dirty test: standing at (-1037.71, -453.01) I cast Lava Font at max range. Run to it and try to stand in the center. Now standing at (-1038.23, -423.45). Distance formula = 29.56. So 29.56 of whatever unit MumbleLink uses.
---
1200 / 29.56 = 40.58.
---
40.58(ish) is *essentially* equal to 39.37 (inches in a meter), for all practical purposes. But not exactly equal.
---
Siren's Reef is IMHO mechanically the worst fractal ever made.
---
Ah soz.
---
Well I think the reason why u can buy essence is because we might lose them between crafting stages.
---
I accidentally list bit and had to repurchase
---
How does it work without the -email and -password input? Does it autocomplete the login form when we enter our passwords into your client? Should we feel secure in using this tool or do you store our information somewhere? 
---
I don't get why EotM isn't just used as another Borderlands instead. There are 3 borderlands in total, why should 1 be different from the other two?
---
If ArenaNet is concerned with people waiting to get into WvW, there should be MORE  borderlands instances to contest. Not a temp holding area where are there are no stakes and no reason for WvWers to play in.
---
In fact, I'd propose day-long borderland instances that close and tabulate results to make win-loss in WvW more salient than it currently is. At this moment, realms start giving up the week-long fight by Monday because there's no way to overturn the results. So there's really only two out of seven days of the week where WvW is competitive. Shorten the cycles and see the activity go up.
---
I sense your new. Just wait until you have months with no event lol
---
I'll take it off your hands ;)

Omg I want one 
---
Sorry for the late reply, no, rev is not allowed in any capacity. 
---
Sorry for the necro here, just finished the story and browsing for spoiler threads I've been dodging. 100% agree with you. A lot of people clearly dislike Aurene's departure, but I applaud Anet for this assuming she stays dead. I've been able to basically "read" the story for a decent amount of time now, but this cliffhanger completely caught me offguard. 
---
Think about it for a second, deeper than what we normally see people discuss. She was more than a "symbol of hope" that we have been counting on, she represented the culmination of effort and energy on the player's part. Her death makes us ask the question: what were the last 2 years for? Her loss is OUR loss. For players that REALLY liked her, it's kind of a meta thing too. That plush aurene backpack your character is wearing is now a hell of a lot more.
---
Anet told us already that the fight would kill Aurene (the visions that freaked her out), but both players and ingame characters alike had a strong naiive hope that we would overcome this impossible task like we always have. And, well, we didn't. They broke the "main character plot armor" in a great turn of events. Some people say they hate where the story is going, but I love it. Assuming she stays dead forever, of course.
---
&gt; I hate to rain on your parade... :(
---
Haha, I don't mind. I would be scared if no one was critical.
---
During opening I always kept an eye on the magic find counter. Using Open all the counter is on 962 for most of the time. This made me write a mouseclick macro which was very fast. It can open a stack of wvw potions in half a second (my gw2 test sample) and online click testers agreed that it was fast. But envelopes are a different beast, they drop a lot of stuff and thus the lag gets insane when a lot of them are openend in a row. That's why I updated the clicker to only click for 0,5 seconds after a 3,1 second wait.
---
I know for sure that the smaller stacks are opened within the 1 second because I had my hero panel open. I waypointed a lot to clear the right side of the screen to reset lag.
---
But I know this is my word vs yours and the only way to convince you (and all them nay-sayers in map chat) is to record it. Sadly my poor laptop has trouble recording as it is, to open with a recorder would just be silly. I did one test run, but my screenshots were more reliable than the slideshow I had recorded. If/when I get a better setup I will probably revisit stuff like this and be able to record, untill then you have to rely on my honor as a bag opener.
---
Technically living story isn't free.
---
It's just delayed paid content. You have to purchase an expansion to get living story, so it's part of the expansion cost and just released later. 
---
If it was free as they state then it shouldn't be locked behind expac purchases :)
---
Beautiful! I would buy this if you sold them,  actually I think a lot of people would. Good job!
---
Been playing since headstart with about 10K hours and I also have 0 tomes at any time haha. Not enough WvW and PvP. 28 characters though. 
---
I'm not OP but I've played plenty of PvP and WvW and whilst spawn camping sometimes happens, for it to be done for the duration of a  map is regarded as toxic by most
---
We had ro wait here and there, some people had to relog, because they couldn't respawn or ressed after a gg, we where chatting a bit, we weren't totally focused, but the run otself was smooth.
---
Playing DH for 3h years now, I can definitely tell you that GS is the best DPS weapon. The DH's burst is huge and thanks to Lithany of Wrath, if you don't get CC, you will be able to destroy any groups of foes. 
---
In the case multiple waves, just walk back a little, switch to scepter / focus, DPS (also a nice one, many underestimate scepter 2) then switch back to GS and cleave.
---
This is the same debate going on, but condis classes struggle more to cleave foes as you need to stack condies for your DPS to be good. 
---
I cannot for the life of me understand how anyone can think that you can sustain a game such as GW2 with Living Story content only. They need expansions to generate revenue; revenue from the expansion and from ensuing microtransactions. "Expansion level content" without an expansion is basically giving things away for free when you could make money off of them by bundling them and selling them as an expansion. It's a nice idea, but economically stupid. It would be really surprising to me if they didn't release an expansion this year. Unless they are actually slowly winding GW2 down, but I don't think there have been large layoffs to suggest that they are.
---
nice art, liked it! :)
---
What addons are supported?
---
I said desert BL attracts shit players. This is also true for piken home bl, but that's a piken problem and not a general problem. Piken just... well it mostly teaches players some pretty bad habits. 
---
You say the north towers on desert are easier than on alpine, this is true. Except where on alpine you have objectives where people will go towards to defend that aren't "the north towers". The easiest actually defended towers on alpine aren't the north towers. On desert, south towers will NOT generate you any action 99% of the time. After that your easiest objectives are straight to north towers, because the keeps are absurd.
---
About that, if T2 hills is "harder" for you then idk what to say. T2 hills takes less supply, less effort to get into, fairly easy to control lordsroom too. Just gotta manage to get over the bridge, which on EU is usually pretty fucking easy. 
---
 
---
&gt;Even if the other group is competent you can still force a fight outside air keep lord. Stand at the top of the stairs, let someone with a blink stand slightly in front to get the doughnut and run down the stairs to either side if an organised group comes. If the lord resets you can just start again after your fight. It takes so long to run there from earth keep you can then take the lord down before anything but stragglers are there to stop you
---
Why would any enemy group push from front / stair side if they cannot take a frontal fight? I know this is rocket science for some pug groups but it's possible to poke enemy groups without dying like flies, too. Also if you stand on top of the stairs you can be hit by acs from a dozen different spots and you're regularly pushing back and forth past chokes while having places for defenders to cast from almost 360° and on two levels around you. Again I get that with / against piken this is entirely irrelevant. But if i'd say fight with kodash group on desert bl, neither of us will take objectives that are defended unless we ignore them and fight anyways. 
---
&gt;None of the objectives are worse for being trapped at than getting caught at hills or inner bay or garri lord. They each have spacious spots to cata from except arguably for air and earth keeps which are still less bad than hills for this
---
Hills has better cata spots than air and earth keeps. You talk about getting "caught" but for fight player sthe goal is to get enemies to come to you and fight you. I WANT to get caught and have them come defend. I don't want them to sit there and shot 10 unhittable acs at us while nothing comes; or a full pug zone comes to clown on inner (altho this is decent farm and the only way you get piken to stop running away 24/7). 
---
&gt; If what you are doing is tapping a gate and backing away the moment you see defenders, then congratulations you are fighting a group that is happy to fight you open field and practically nothing you have argued here actually applies. You are "luring" the group to fight you in a preferable place, just like you could be doing on desert with all the great places to fight I described
---
One day you'll understand that there needs to be objectives that aren't from the point of view "one side is much weaker and needs significant advantages to be able to put up a fight". This isnt' "fights", this by definition is farming players. If you have EVEN groups desert bl has no place to "lure a fight" and even less "lure them openfield". Those "great places" you described are almost all not actually near enough to pressure objectives properly, have chokes in between them and the objective which and are regularly hitable by the mortars / acs / siege from the objective WHICH YOU CANNOT CLEAR. 
---
"Good fights" means you can have even groups fight eachother for objectives. There are no "objectives" that are easy enough on desert bl to fight over. They're all a major advantage to one side, not a small advantage. And they don't actually make groups converge either, but rather pass eachother without noticing to end up on other sides of the map. Which makes the whole deal dog shit for fights. Don't get how this is difficult to understand, then again piken perspective. 
---
&gt; Furthermore, if you get caught while inside the increased room inside the objectives on desert border means you are less likely to have to retreat than on alpine, that is unless you have already got to the lord and have a choke point to use in your favour
---
The only lordsroom that is more difficult on alpine is garri. Sorry but controlling the lordsroom on bay and hills is pretty fucking easy. Controlling the lordsroom in air is doable but you are forced to play lord minigames. If you go down the area is again close to not controllable for attackers. Fire keep is the same. 
---
They can build ACs on complete opposite sides. They can jump down and glide to lower levels whenever required to avoid death, then run back up on both air and fire. I mean I really don't get it. 
---
Anyways, doesn't suprise me it's a piken player telling me desert bl is amazing yet somehow, even piken doesnt' come near that border if there's actually enemies on it =/ 
---
The fight is good, I don’t think people bash the fight so much as the model.
---
nO cAbBaGe PaTcH?
---
You actually can win and it’s by doing a mix tbh
---
Middle mouse button click is a great option for rolling/dodge. Also, google "gw2 tips you wish you knew" (without the " ").
---
Casual game, devs don’t want to focus on actual repeatable content. 
---
just a few sidenotes (not all). 
---
\- Always use skill 2 right before leaving Celestial avatar. The flower it spawns will release healing after you leave the avatar mode, succesfully charging your bar a bit to go into the state again.
---
\- If you are using the trait 'quick draw' (skirmishing line top right), it is wise to switch to staff and back to axe warhorn once in a while. The reason is as following: it reduces the cooldown on the first skill you use. This means that after you switch back to axe, you can use the warhorn 5 skill twice really fast.
---
lol
---
&gt; Last Question: I still have one lvl 80 updgrade left and I can't decide which class to pick. Most of the time I play alone running through PVE, farming or doing some events. Which class could you recomend? I like the design of the revenant and the mesmer, but cannot judge if they are suited for me. Would love to hear from you guys.
---
you can always make a level 1 char and go to the pvp area to test the full level 80 class on all the different golems there.
---

Joko was a joke. He had two fights, and lost both. How the hell did he get such a big name? Only redeeming thing about him was his speech, now I loved that, he actually talks as he witnessed history itself. 
---
Didn't play gw1. So I had really high hopes for joko.
---
There are dual pistol mesmers in Draconis Mons too.  I thought that was going to be the new elite spec weapon for PoF.  Guess it's only for Npcs right now.
---
In my experience as a plat tier ranked pvper that has played since launch, it's not common to have a team that is so inexperienced or poor at their class / role that your whole team gets spawn camp farmed for an entire match deliberately. I have never seen this happen, done this, or known any group of players to do this. Most teams just wanna get their reward track points for a win and move on to the next. So, yes, it does seem like you were grieved by opportunistic players who found that they were significantly more skilled and coordinated and could use that advantage to completely control your team. However, I will say, even some ranked matches are a wash and the other team, either through more experience, skill, or a certain composition of classes, will steam roll even a relatively competent team and put the team on the defensive. In ranked where players are much more coordinated and skilled, it's very hard to control the opposing team that much that you can spawn camp and still win, but I won't say I have never had a couple teammates give up and let the other team basically keep us in the base due to snowballed control of the map. It happens, but it's extremely rare and usually caused by a disconnect.  
---
Wash-out matches happen, but I think what is particularly uncommon about your situation is that the opposing team deliberately did not cap so that you all would keep coming out of the base so they could repeatedly kill you. This is highly irregular and I would not base the climate of the entire game mode on a poor experience you had because a whole guild team of ranked players played cat and mouse with you. What should have been done if you were getting beat that bad was to just not keep feeding them kills. They would have eventually realized and then capped to win the game. This can happen in un-ranked because there's no matchmaking considerations made and you can queue with up to 5 people if you like. At certain hours of the day, you can go in an un-ranked match and have a match with very good players from ranked and have the match be as difficult or more difficult than a typical rated match because it's a free for all. Anyone can come in with a full team of players they know and are on voice coms with -- my guild does it all day every day. I can assure you that, while there is a difficulty curve in learning PvP, this problem is not at all common and is not representative of the game mode or an average match climate.  
---
There's really nothing ArenaNet can do about the behavior because it's essentially a free-for all mode. If you want a better shot at getting placed against teams of similar skill level so this won't happen, that's what ranked is for. Unranked is not a competitive mode. You fight other players, but there are no ranks so it's not competitive. Same way that going to an arcade to play street fighter against a random teenager is not competitive street fighter. Here's what you can do to avoid this even though I assure you it's not at all common, you just got a really bad team matched up against a good one...find a guild, find players to teach you to play your class and role correctly in PvP, and don't let a bad match up make you feel invalidated; it just that, a bad match up. 
---
First thing is to figure out what exactly is killing you each time. HoT Maguuma is known for having dangerous areas with mobs that either move in packs or are more solitary but harder-hitting. Thief, on the other hand, is known for high single-target damage that relies very much on good positioning (e.g. flanking) to shine. It's possible that:
---
a) You are engaging with too many enemies at once, and before you can kill them all, you get overwhelmed.
---
b) You are engaging with one enemy at a time, but find yourself unable to dodge or mitigate its attacks before you do enough damage to kill it.
---
Maybe it's both. The trick is to change your thinking and learn to assess each situation and its likely outcome before you engage.
---
Are there too many enemies? Perhaps you can try pulling them one at a time from range. Not possible? Perhaps you should stealth past them and not engage.
---
A single enemy giving you trouble? Learn its attack patterns. Is it firing projectiles (e.g. a bristleback)? Bring reflects or other projectile mitigation. [Smoke Screen](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Smoke_Screen), for instance.
---
As a thief you rely on your ability to stealth, to blind, and to dodge. You have a huge number of different skills that allow you to do one or the other (or both, e.g. in the case of Blinding Powder, which blinds enemies and stealths you). If you can't dodge an attack, blind the foe before they hit you. If you are overwhelmed, stealth and disengage with your high mobility. You need to be familiar with your arsenal of skills and when you will need each one. Since you're navigating the jungle solo, this would mean that you should take a look at your weapons and utilities and change them up for different scenarios. Don't focus on damage only, if your initial burst once exhausted isn't enough to kill everything.
---
Also, just because you can hit things doesn't mean you should always engage in a fight. Sometimes it's better to stealth and avoid combat altogether. As a thief, this is exceptionally easy for you -- you can blast or leap through [smoke fields](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Smoke_field) (e.g. Smoke Screen, Pistol 5) or you can use skills like Shadow Refuge. Be sneaky.
---
Remind me, When did we see the head of Jormag? I don't recall ever seeing it.
---
My bet is somewhere between 1 year and never. 
---
I have yet to hear any complaints about The Silverwastes, if anything is nothing but praise. It really is a fucking great map.
---
I mean what I tried to say is that many elite specializations borrow mechanics from other classes like Spellbreaker is essentialy a mesmer with all the interupts and boonremoval. 
---
I’m not saying that this is bad, but you compared my mechanic to be a core engi. So it’s nothing like the scrapper being just core engi+.
---
I borrowed a mechanic that already excist, that being conjure weapons(ele)/kits (engi), and adjusted it to thief. Because why event a new wheel while there is already a functioning one? Plus it fits a thieves theme as well, stealing weapons.

---
That's why my guardian gears end up legendaries.
---
I'd have to disagree. By virtue of the combat system, fluidity, and other factors, the instanced content is definitely more engaging than 90% of what WoW has to offer. For most of the WoW leveling experience, I never felt even remotely threatened by mobs and with the traditional tank and healer roles in WoW instanced content, there's really very little you have to be aware of or react to there in comparison. Normal or Mythic raids and, to a lesser extent, Mythic+ dungeons are the only exception, but I think GW2 raid encounters are just more visceral and better designed in most cases (Deimos for example) to compliment varied encounter mechanics beyond what you get in WoW, which is pretty much tank and spank aside from raids where you may have to pay attention to one or two mechanics as a DPS. There's really nothing about WoW that makes me want to ever consider playing it again over GW2, especially because it's subscription based.

"why am I supposed to hit them once in a blue moon when I could wipe them from the face of the earth...? screw that."
---
9x max size bags because im not bothered about inventory sorting in general, and 1x invisible bag where i keep all my runes, trinkets and weapons
---
Got all 10 with the basic pack, Uncanny Jar, 7 Halloween Pail and the 32 Slot Reinforced Olmakhan Bandolier.
---
I used a variety of bags over the years but I ended up with this.
---
* the basic pack is because of nostalgia (and I'm not that rich to get higher than 20 slot bags)
---
* The Uncanny Jar, well, free 20 slots if you complete the collection
---
* The Halloween Pail are great and pretty cheap for a "no restriction" type of bag with 20 slots at halloween
---
* The Olmakhan is also a collection thing and fairly easy to get
---
I also used invisible or the 20 slots from fractals before but I wasn't happy with the loot stacking in the middle of inventory (since I don't use the "show individual bags" option).
---
Yeah it was weird, but I like it now that I get it.
---
I don't carry a massive amount of gear.  Like 1 extra set and weapons.  So I haven't needed to go outside 1 invisible bag.  Store my unid gear and stuff I don't want to randomly sell or deposit in there.
---
Other than that the 1 32 slot Olmakhan bag (consumables go in there).  Half is full of consumables I use.  
---
Rest is 7 20 slot normals.  
---
Yea I’m too lazy to craft it 😩
---
Now you've turned into some kinda mad scientist.
---
I never played gw1. But I heard someone in a video once say that there was a map where you farmed obsidian armor, and that it was hard and time consuming and prestige, and I really want a zone like that in gw2. Requiem armor? easy, legendary armor? Easy, but time gated (fucking turn off) Luminescent armor? Actually good and entertaining, I enjoyed getting this one, a lot. Plus, free ascended. I know, I got off topic, sorry.
---
I mostly play Mesmer and Revenant.
---
 Mesmer can scratch any itch you might have except for ranged. Mirage is a lot of fun to play in PvP and WvW, tons of movement, clone spawning, and
---
 teleporting. Chronomancer can play support or power very easily. Support Chrono drops Wells that proc after 3 seconds, lets you extend boons on your allies, and has a fair bit of crowd control. If you raid at all you're expected to tank more or less every time, too.
---
 Power Chrono is incredible easy and has high single target damage but low leave., you have 4 phantasms you drop every time they're up, and you use a clever trick to refresh their cooldowns so you can spawn 12ish phantasms one after another. You fill your downtime with autoattacks and sword 2. 
---
I only play condi renegade, but it's my favorite condi class to play. It was the recipient of my first legendary. The raid rotation can be a bit complicated, but open world you have a fair amount of cleave and shortbow as a ranged option. You do have to manage an energy mechanic, so that turns some people off. 
---
I wish they did the same with Braham's outfit, when they released the shoulders as individual skin.
---
Lmao.
---
This looks wonderful, awesome job, I always love them in game, they give such magical, mystery atmosphere!!! 
---
I played and enjoyed BDO until about level 40, or should I say that I played until I learned that after a certain level any player can kill you in open world. That's just not my cup of tea, so I bailed.  I never really got to the end-game experience, but I heard it's all grind and rng, and some people like it, and I guess I am not against it, specially since the combat is fucking great. I never explored the other aspects of the game, but I guess they are good. 
---
What I like the most about gw2 other than gameplay is ACCOUNT BOUND ITEMS, specially skins, I am an alt-oholic so this is like a match made in heaven. Honestly my answer is going to be biased since I've played for over 2k hours so far, I don't like PvP or WvW all that much, but sometimes I need a gift of battle and have to play it. But other than that I pretty much enjoy every aspect of pve.
---
I am brand new just downloaded the game but havent logged in yet so I know nothing. I was wondering how to pick a server? From what I read all NA servers are hosted in Virginia so  I don't have to worry about finding a central time zone one. Also apparently guilds are cross server. I don't seem interested in WvW pvp so is there anything I should consider when picking a server? Will being on a lower population realm be better to avoid lag? Will I not be able to find people to play with unless I play on a big server? Any feedback  is greatly appreciated. I really want to jump in and start playing but want to make a good decision on this first. Thank you
---
From what I understand you need educated arguments to force her to try GW2 while at the same time you want to avoid BDO (and for good reasons I say).
---
I have a proposition for for you: if you have access to it then let her help you in trying BDO and in exchange you can help her in trying GW2.
---
By the way, GW2 can be grindy as hell. 
---
Well she'd be right there, the level "grind" in GW2 is pretty lax and short, even the gear grind is fast.
---
The game is very alt friendly and is all about making your own adventure, some people still invest mot of their time into 1 or 2 characters, but you can easily get multiple max level characters and switch between them when content  calls for it.
---
The game is more about personal skill than how high your stats are, you will hit the stat wall fast, and then it's all about skill.
---
collision would be a nightmare if you had to get that close
---
Yeah, but you have 6 legends you can swap between. 
---
Hope some talented people can find a new family

I admit, that comment can be confusing ;) B2P mmo concepts only really work if you manage to keep your longtime players spending about roughly $10 each month, be it through DLCs or gemshop. Otherwise you have to stop developing parts of the game, which in turn means you attract less new players etc.
---
So my question was rather meant in an inflammatory way, since most gw2 players just LOOOOOVE the game. But then only play it on the side without spending money in gemshop to keep anet flush enough to develop more. And thats mainly due to the fact that you can just not play the game for months without missing out on anything... no playing, no exposure to gemshop, no money for anet. Gear treadmill would keep players logged in and tempted to spend more.
---
Server only matter for WvW  and currently in WvW some server are regularly "linked" to try and create balanced population for match-ups.
---
Outside of WvW the exact server you pick (after you chose whether you wanna be on EU or NA) has no impact on ping, lag, or who you can play with in PvE/PvP.
---
Willing to help if you're on NA
---
The funny thing about that is pre-HoT everyone said the game was too easy. Careful what you wish for I guess lmao.
---
Hi There!
---
I play both BDO and GW2 and I love both games, I've been playing both games for more than 2 \~ 3 years.  However, my main focus is on BDO at the current moment (until I get burned out by it and switch back go GW2 for a while).
---
***(Side note: A lot of the things are based on MY point of view and MY opinion, I'm not trying to encourage or discourage people to play either games, simply my opinion &amp; pov).***
---
As I'm close to the "end game" or "Softcap" as we call it.  BDO is oh so grindy... The hours that I need to put into grinding just for another 1 or 2% of exp is... long.. 
---
The community of BDO is oh so toxic... Sure there are a lot of nice people out there and I've met quite a few of them, but the closer you get to end game the more toxic it gets, especially in popular grinding spots.
---
The most distinct difference that i can give you is that BDO is a lot more stressful compared to GW2.  
---
95% of all the elements in BDO are heavily based on RNG.  Gear enhancement, especially boss gear enhancement will cost you a fortune and cause a lot of frustrations depending on ur luck.  
---
As a new-er player, it is very hard to get into the game and it takes a long time in order to catch up to mid-late game players.  
---
Once you're out of the "Olvia-servers" or "Noob-servers" you'll get steamrolled and PK'ed by late/end game players with full boss gear, most of the time without any specific reason other than: "cuz we can, cuz its fun".
---
There is also so much irl money involved in order to get the most out of the game (not required but if you want to be as efficient as possible).  
---
E.g. 5 pets are almost a must for grinding (maximize speed, time is exp &amp; money!), costume sets for exp boost (not required, but nice to have), monthly Value Pack for inventory space increase, inventory weight inc etc. (again not required, but very convenient to have).  Sure you get a few free pets during certain events, however you will "have to" sink some money into the game if you want to be as efficient as possible.
---
This is all I can think of as of this moment while at work.  Again I want to emphasize that the things I've mentioned above are from my perspective as a player who plays both games.  Feel free to disagree but please keep it civil.
---
Hope this helps!
---
I don't think that is the approach for GW2 to take. There is a market with those kinds of games already. It is better to find your niche and build on it, rather than trying to cater to players outside of your core audience, and risk alienating your current players. Raids were already a tricky enough thing for this, and I don't think taking it further in that direction is the right approach.
---
But thats just my opinion at least. :)
---
F2P is more like a trial since of the TP and chat limitations. That said, you have access to all the core content and it's going to take a while for you to run out of things to do. If you were level 80 you are probably pretty current since the level cap didn't got up. And if you had a nice stats armor that is also current, maybe Meta build changed but that is always changing due to anet balance patches.
---
My advice is have fun! Level a new character and get a hang of how things are =D
---
THAT sounds cool and illuminating.. especially the 3rd paragraph. 
---
I always did WvW but never even stepped into pvp as I know I suck and I'm a casual player.. when it comes to builds id just copy the ones my guilds have and never question anything lol so I guess theres a lot to say about personal achievement there and wanting to be good and competitive and such. 
---
So BDO has no challenging PvE either? (I would assume the challenging PvE for GW2 were t3-t4 fractals and raids but maybe not then?)
---
Fantastic. So if we want to pay through the core game to try it out we aren't going to be gated by anything?
---
Right. I guess some people see it that way.
---

---
I think we have a resource for returning players somewhere, someone should link it... ^.^
---
"max level", so level 80 is still the max level nothing changed in that regard, F2P-players now have pretty much the same access to the game you had back then with the core game except for limitations in chat/whisper usage and restrictions in the items you can trade on the Trading Post.
---
The two Expansions most importantly give access to 
---
* The Revenant profession
---
* Elite Specialisations (one set for each class per expansion which includes a different take on mechanics or now machanics as well as access to a weapon that was previously unusable by that class)
---
* Raiding, former wings are tied to Heart of Thorns, current wings tied to Path of Fire
---
* Movement mechanics - Gliding with Heart of Thorns and Mounts(!!! + ! ! !) with Path of Fire
---
* Access to the respective expansion areas, living story areas are locked behind the respective living story chapters which are available in the BLTC for gems (and were for free had you been active during that time). [though I don't know whether you can buy for example ls2 chapters only owning Path of Fire].
---
No new weapons and no new races (e.g. tengu) though.
---
When creating a norn character, the beginning cutscene features a small silhouette of Jormag’s head. Also, we haven’t directly seen it but Braham has most likely seen Jormag as well.
---
HoT was not too hard imo, but it was too grindy for sure, especially when elite spec unlocking required you to spend 400 skill points per character. Also, HoT broke dungeons and no holy trinity, which were the core design philosophies of the game. GW2 is a very different game right now than it used to be and it's not necessarily a good thing, to be honest.
---
wow players are used to content existing and content working
---
it being good content is another question but i think the phrase is "don't kid yourself"
---
HOT wasn't hard, but Verdant Brink was too complicated and unforgiving for a starting map.  Also the reward systems were just bad.
---
first 5 skills depends on what weapons you wield. a two handed weapons will give you 5 predetermined skills, one hand weapon will give you 3 and off-hand weapon will gives you last 2, you also have 2 weapon sets you can swap on most professions. then you have 5 utility skills you can choose freely.
---
Some professions have even more way to change skills, like elementalists while changing attunements, or engineer while equipping kits, and also, every expansion gives you an elite specialization, wich gives you access to a new weapon, actually every profession have 2 elite specializations, there's a list of all weapons every profession can wield (M stands for Main-hand, O stand for Off-hand, T stand for Two-handed, and U for underwater weapon).  
---

---
Weaver elementalists can wield: Sword (M), also have dual attunement, wich gives even more skills by merging elements; Tempest elementalists can wield: Warhor (O).
---
Mesmer:
---
Sword (M, O), Scepter (M), Pistol (O), Focus (O), Torch (O), Greatsword (T), Staff (T), Spear (U), Trident (U).

---
Scouge Necromancers can wield: Torch (O); Reaper necromancers can wield: Greatsword (T).
---
Trust me, the possible combinations are huge...obviously, if you're looking on a specific weaon to use you may first decide wich build uses it at the best and then select a profession for it \^\^
---
If you're indeed coming back that means you plready purchased the game when it came out. That means you're not a f2p player anymore. As for your girlfriend, you can check out the [restricitions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Free_accounts) here.
---
I'd advise you to just play the game, pick a class which sounds fun to you, level up, do some dungeons and random events, check out the festival in the human city which is currently going on and so on. If you like it, you can still buy the expansions later on, but they only provide level 80 content.
---
Be aware though that GW2 isn't a really typical MMO like WoW is, it doesn't really hold your hand in any way (which is nice for some things and not so nice for other aspects of the game). Basically, pick your own goals and keep working towards them. If you have fun, great! If not, maybe GW2 isn't the game for you.
---
We also have a pinned [weekly questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aos6qb/weekly_rguildwars2_question_thread_february_09/) thread in this subreddit and you can type "/wiki [thing you want to know more about] in the ingame chat and it opens a browser window with the corresponding wiki page.
---
For example "/wiki ranger pets" takes you to all the available pets that can be tamed by the ranger class.
---
To be honest you cant really judge bdo unless you have played it alot more then you have (nothing against you just being serious, its a game with so much in it you cant possibly experience it without putting in thousands of hours) 
---
That being said BDO is a giant waste of time and not worth getting into at this point unless you buy an account or are willing to put close to 500 hours of grinding in to catch up to where players are (Low balling that, RNG is a joke in that game)
---
thanks for this input!
---
Yeah that sounds exactly like the kind of player my sister is actually.. she often tells me about people she rolls over 'cuz i can and its fun' which i never understood. What do you enjoy doing in BDO and what do you enjoy doing in GW2 if I may ask? And why do you enjoy or why do you think other people enjoy such a heavily based RNG grindy game?
---
Hell yeah that's great. Alright we gonna try it this weekend! Thanks!
---
Very noob friendly, you will love it &lt;3 welcome to Tyria!
---
Nope, your girlfriend (she is probably a f2p player?) will have some restrictions but they are mostly chat and trading restrictions to stop gold sellers and the likes from spamming people.
---
We can still form a party together right?
---
Core game is F2P, but if you *do* have it bought on an account, use that one. You get more character slots and less restrictions to trading post. Also, you might have some living story chapters on that account.
---
For a new player, buying anything is not necessary. I recommend getting (close) to max level before buying anything. After that, you can get the expansions (or just one of them) to lift F2P restrictions and to get more content. Also, mounts and gliding are awesome!
---
If you want to play through the story in chronological order, things get a bit messy after hitting the max level. You can't play LS1 at all, which is a shame. For LS2, mounts or gliding would be nice to have, but they are introduced in story missions that chronologically happen *after* it. Also, in my opinion, PoF is much more newbie-friendly than HoT; alas, HoT comes before it chronologically.
---
Do they? Hmm... Yea I can see the issue now. Didn't think something like that would be possible so easily. Kind of ruins the whole concept because of that. What do you suggest in order to make this concept work? 
---
If you'd like to start new characters, the core game will last you a while. As soon as you hit lvl 80 and finish the core story you might want to look into getting the expansions, which adds gliders and mounts. And they really shake up how you play the game in a good way!
---
Ellipses are incredibly annoying as well... their presence indicates something negative has been left unsaid... in dialogue... but in a written comment... generally means the guy using them hasn't got the balls to just say it and would rather "imply" their negativity without risking being called out for it...
---
Anet being reported on glassdoor to pay below industry standard is not something blizzard devs will consider imo. Anet has a reputation of being entry-level employer for game devs, not a company experienced devs aspire to get to.
---
Activision-Blizzard laid off about 800 employees, mostly from "Non-development positions" as of yesterday. Mostly marketing, eSports and community managers so far. But at least two boss encounter designers are confirmed to be gone as well.
---
This came right on top of the corporation announcing that they had made record revenue numbers, and the CEO said that they had to lay off people to "Maximize their potential".
---
Around 800 people from the Blizzard-Activision group (so include people from various Blizzard teams) were laid-off. The timing also looks pretty ironic considering profit have hit an all time high this year for them.
---
Devs didn’t get cut loose, mostly PR or community people and legal teams.
---
The backpack is actually different for gold wings and wings of love though. The wings of love fold up whereas the gold wings just kinda hang out. Just think that's important to point out.
---
Me too! Can't say the same for the rest of my guildmates, but at least I have fun :D
---
Ohhhh, those are awesome. 
---
Leveling in GW2 is extremely simple. Even if you are totally new to this sort of game you have a lot of time to learn and no stress since we have no gear tread mill like many other games do. We have had the two same sets of endgame gear since the beginning of the game. The only thing that is changing is the stats which you can swap easy. 
---
So join the game play it in your pace and if you get stuck just ask people around you for help or explanations :)
---
17k hours of gameplay, had first pre drop after reaching 300% MF after 15K+ hours of gameplay, and was Lover (I hate taht shortbow).  
---
Then few hundreds hour later dropped the Venom in Silverwastes.
---
Honestly, I'm just glad we can craft those now, feels waaaaay more rewarding \^ \^.  
---
Gw2 pros : Gear stays relevant forever, better balanced, not p2w, has pve(dungeons,raids,story),
---
Gw2 cons : Bad optimization,Very slow content releases(unless you only care about story),Worse graphics that bdo, instanced.
---
Bdo pros : Very fun and flashy combat, Open word, Getting new gear feels very nice(because of the rng I ll talk in cons),Pvp has meaning, Very good graphics
---
Bdo cons : P2W(pets,maids,value pack,kama blessing,cronstones,artisan memories and even getting in game currency), Very grindy (a casual player will never get to softcap), Rng heavy, No pve(brainless grinding mobs is not pve), unbalanced, Only the gear matters in pvp (if you have worse gear you lose automatically). Very slow content releases (we only get like 2 new classes every year and maybe a new zone to grind mobs and thats it).
---
It's player vs. player.  
---
You're occasionally going to run into people that do things that you disagree with whether they're on your team or the opposing team. 
---
I'm afraid that's just a part of both life and the game.  Truth be told, the more you maximize interaction with them the more you feed their ego/satisfaction.  If you can't handle losing in a humiliating fashion then you shouldn't play player vs. player.  ***It happens occasionally,*** and if you're going to get all bent out of shape over it then I'd urge you to not play pvp. 
---
Learning to not take it so seriously is difficult alt-tab and listen to music or calm down and watch some YouTube or Twitch.  You're not going to get very far in sPVP if you can't accept a loss graciously.  If you team had truly given up all you really had to do was AFK or alt-tab until the game was over.  You may have lost, but you only really lose when you make an active choice to let your enemies affect your emotional-state and well-being  Yes, they should have ended the game.  However, what you need to realize is that by getting so frustrated and upset all you really did was make for appetizing entertainment.  
---
&gt; Any tips for new + returning players
---
Well, its harder than you remember from times of vanilla GW2. However, plenty of things can and imo should be done with small group of friends, no as part giant zerg.
---
This seems pretty awesome! 
---
Good Job! 
---
Am I the only one who manages just fine without Invisible bags? Haven't accidentally sold a Legendary or Ascended item in over 7k hrs played. Besides I just like to have my gear at the top of my inventory.
---
1. No it's not challenging.
---
2. Yes, expansion gives you hundreds of hours of content, very fun and mostly OP (compared to base game) Elite Specializations and mounts (PoF exclusive) which are incredibly fun and well integrated in the game.
---
3. Just buy Heart of Thorns + Path of Fire, if you have extra money to spare, buy the fancy versions of them that come with gems and other goodies and use the gems to buy chapters of the episodic "Living World" so you get even more content to play.
---
* If you have any further questions about GW2 feel free to send me a PM and I'll gladly answer them for you.
---
life never gave me pre drops but gave me infusion drops
---
One of the most noob friendly mmos I've ever played, been playing for years. You can pretty much jump into any content almost always someone is willing to explain/show you the basics. I do just fine in fractals/dungeons on core DPS warri and guard if that gives you any idea.
---
The expansions are absolutely worth it, especially PoF due to mounts being the many wonders of traversing making mobility smooth &amp; less frustrating.
---
If you like PvP it is 5v5 conquest nodes but you will wanna check out websites like metabattle to start off with builds... learn the basics/rotations etc. There is also WvW which is basically large scale combat e.g; zerg fights 50v50v50, roaming, capture objectives enemy territory if you're into that. It's easy to spot a commander tag and join the squad and get some bags, comrade.
---
Hope that helps answer your question(s).
---
Omg it looks amazing!
---
Contrary to what most peopld are saying, I would not call GW2 noob-friendly for a person that has little to no experince with MMOs, especially if playing solo. The combat is fast paced and depending on your class and build you can have a pretty hard time starting out. Most likely you will die a lot before ypu get the hang of it, but once it "clicks" the game will become extreme easy outside the end-game. 
---
The best way to mitigate the injtial hurdle imo is to play with someone. It doesnt have to be a friend, you can look for random people in your area doing the same activity and just tag along, you dont even need to group with or talk to them if you dont want to.
---
And yes, the expansions are worth it for the story and specializations alone. Also, I believe each will give you a shared inventory slot and you MUST put a copper fed salvage o matic from the gem shop in one, eventually ofc. once you are sure that you will stick with the game, that is probably the single best value QoL investment.
---
None, the end game "dungeons" that we have are just tankier mobs (Hystria &amp; Aakman).   To be able to grind there you need to grind lower places for 1 or 2 years prior in order to get the gear to grind there lol.
---
Wait, I'm out of the loop, what happened with WoW?
---
Why not just put your invisible bag on the first slot so yout gear is at the top of the inventory? 
---
Ps: sending you jinx protection vibes, fren. 
---
That is sweet. Reminds me of my first days in GW2. You keep at it. This game stays fun.
---
Tbh i think you need to accept that she is in to BDO now and stop trying to convince her. If she jumps in because you force her she will dislike the game anyway and not give it a try. 
---
I have a gaming friend and we played together for years and years in different games, i started GW2 long before him. He was still hooked in the game i played together with him before GW2 and he wanted to finnish the last raid wing before leaving. 
---
I went on with GW2 and tried to tell him that he should really give it a chance. But he was still invested in that other game just as i had been but got out of it and i realized i had to let him do what he wanted and hope he would change his mind at some point. 
---
At some point there was a free to try weeken (this was before f2p) and he tried it out and got kind of hooked. But it was not until i showed him a video of me and my guidl raiding in WvW were he said i want to do this. Took a bit of effort to convince my raid leader to pick in a total noob with no knowledge of WvW what so ever. But i know my friend and i knew he would adjust in to it fairly fast, and he did. And what seemed totally impossible months earlier changed with that video and he left the other game and we played GW2 since then.
---
Thing is he now often grumble at me saying why did you not convince me to play GW2 earlier and i try to remind him of all the times he just rolled his eyes at me for trying to force him to try out GW2 when he was not ready for it.
---
So sometimes people just don't know that they want to play GW2 and you have to wait for them to reach that point when they are open for it. But you can not force that, just wait and be ready if the time comes with good information and videos about things she like about games. 
---
you could also give her the expacs as birthday or christmas gift and hope she try it out at some point when she have a day were she is bored of grinding the same mobs at the same spot for 6 hours and open to try something else.
---
Not WoW as a game but Blizzard fired nearly 800 employes. Blizzard owns a lot of games and not only WoW is affected by it.
---
2x invisible
---
2x standard/starter
---
1x fractal masterwork 
---
1x fractal rare 
---
1x material
---
I was worried about that 1.6 Ghz core clock of the CPU but it seems to have the turbo boost feature so it goes up to 3.70 GHz... seems like perfectly fine CPU and the RAM and GPU are more than sufficient for the game too.
---
But as the other commenter pointed out, the game will not run smooth in all occasions, no matter how good PC you have you'll drop to like 30 FPS or lower in some huge fights.
---
Don't you love it when you get waves and waves and waves of mobs, while you have to focus on a boss that has three AOEs, *and* those wind thingies?
---
Oh. And when you're lucky, you get birds! What an awesome Fractal. &lt;3
---
1. Don't look for GW2 builds on YouTube, there are two sites which are metabattle.com and snowcrows.com (the latter being leaned towards endgame content/raids) that provide you with plenty of great, well researched builds for every class and every game mode.
---
2. You can't base how well you can play by comparing your performance in the core game, which is not challenging at all.
---
3. No matter how good you are, you're not supposed to "solo" most of the Maguuma Hero points, ask in map chat for help or wait for an "HP Train" to pass by and help you out.
---
4. Regarding getting your ass kicked by random enemies, as a thief (or any profession for that matter), you should learn what your skills and traits do. You gotta actually read them and learn to apply them on different situations; eg. you see a pack of monsters which hit really hard, you can use steal (F1) to get right in the middle of them, use Black Powder (Pistol Skill no. 5) to blind everything and then cleave them down with pistol whip (Sword Skill no.3 while paired with pistol).
---
5. If you want even more survivability you could use Invigorating Precision (Critical Strikes grandmaster trait) that heals you for 10% of your outgoing critical damage (20% with fury).
---
6. Both revenant and mesmer classes are in a great spot right now (although mesmer pretty much has always been), and in my opinion, revenant is absolute aids to level up, so I'd use the boost on him.
---
On the Auric weapons grind have you taken all your chars through to that part of the story?? Doesn't take that long and if you check out the wiki I seem to remember there's a table showing which 3 weapons each class can choose from. Can figure out the best options to tick as many off as possible and it's a ton easier and means you don't need to craft many. Think I only ended up crafting one from scratch iirc because I also got some from PvP reward tracks from PvP farm
---
There are puzzle rooms in Deepstone?
---
Also, hint: dodge completely stops your movement even when Slippery Slope is active.
---
Ah very useful! Thanks!
---
I regularly play with some US folks and the ping shouldn't be too bad (I think someone had 300ms vs my 50ms as an European) and ping doesn't really matter all that much I guess.
---
English is fine, sometimes you just see people spamming their guild ads in the map chat in Polish, German, French and whatever :p
---
Dodge or jump? Because when I dodge I gain even more momentum with slippery slope, which doesn't help at all.
---
Let me rephrase: dropping support for dungeons and the introduction of holy trinity were against core design philosophy.
---
BTW, played the game since launch. No need to be toxic.
---
Yes. I salvaged 2 excellences from about 20 living story amulets. I had a lot of spare mats from daily home instance gathering. Unlocked 1 excellence
---
and sold the other to get a legendary and some 32 slot bags. :)
---
Dodge. Jumping is wonky, but you completely lose momentum after finishing dodge.
---
The maze was fun. Well, yes, I really had fun seeing people falling around and failing to skip the last orb via the edge run^^
---
No.
---
Please keep thieves quiet.
---
&gt; Mostly marketing, *eSports* and community managers so far
---
eSports dreams \o/
---
that rabbit mustache 😂 but great work, OP :)
---
People also complained that beta/release GW2 was too hard so they dumbed down enemy AI, nerfed dungeons numerous times, and made multiple other changes throughout the years.  Some people were happy, others said it became too easy. Can't please everyone, unfortunately.
---
Then change the camera settings
---
If you felt like you were spending too much personally wouldn't you find ways to cut down on spending? It's the same with companies
---
At arenanet, everyone is a Dev. 
---
Mhhh, Male Kirin Armor OwO
---
Really? I haven't noticed. Well, the "FUCKING GAME" is with the current engine and with this kind of multi threading. Don't like it? Tough shit.
---
I know that the kids want all kind of stuff for free and feel entitled to no end, but the real world doesn't work like this.
---
There are several core tyrian NPCs with skill animations from more than one profession or with gear combinations that we cannot achieve. Maybe lore-wise we are efficient heroes who only utilize viable gear to our profession. This brings up a question for why magic users use heavy armor vs. light armor vs. medium armor. If guardians, revs, and druids don't need light armor then why are the 3 other casters wearing more vulnerable armor? Also, Revs, Mesmers, and Eles seem to cast magic from any weapon they use so lore-wise they probably should be unlimited in their weapon-range.
---
gotta keep the scene moving (servers) somehow
---
Definitely read that as “Anet responsible for firing in Blizzard” and was wondering how they hell they pulled that off
---
Thank you very much! Didnt want him to waste that just so we can play together. 
---
Account related things are not being lost because, well, they are account related and not bound to a character.
---
However, since you said "he started **again**" I wouldn't suggest on deleting the characters. When you delete them you will lose any progress you made with them. this is mainly towards those birthday gifts.
---
So if he has character that are a couple years or even a year old then he would lose that completely and start new with any character.
---
They did not have profit records, they had revenue records.... there is a massive difference there. 
---
Taco's clean. Look up Tekkit's workshop for the plugins that give you signposts and farming routes and stuff.
---
One of the biggest things is that they said their focus this year is community communication. Then they fired most of the CMs. 
---
Our party spent about 8 minutes there and it really extremely annoying. Now imagine when we get birds and we bleed fire with slippery slope there...
---
The funny thing is that Anet disabled slippery slope at the next section, but not at maze. Dunno what they were thinking when not falling to death while moving on a flat large elevator was hard so that they disabled SS for it but staying on a narrow path isn't.
---
Overall, those instabilities are really badly thoughtout. People said this multiple times for weeks. Anet really should do something.
---
Beetle 100, griffon max speed 51, how is the griffon faster? Unless im missing something
---
I think making more languages in the game, at least for the text, would make more interested in the game.
---
Make no mistake, there are many people who turn down various good games simply because "It's not localized in my language"
---
There never was a event tied to it except for the friend thing that you can participate in but that is not a ingame thing.
---
Pretty sure the core game dev didn't get fired. Mosty marketing, sales, community staff get fired. Lots of E-sport related stuff have to go due to canceling Heroes of the Storm official  which is domino effect from letting Destiny go from Activition- Blizzard. 
---
Wait. There meant to be WvW statement soon this or next week. They plan to remove servers and group players for WvW depending on guild. 
---
At least wait until this announcement, we hope to get update eta but who knows.
---
Anyway, deleting old heroes that have some significant birthday rewards is not a good idea so wait some more to avoid it.
---
Income and revenue are two different things. Record revenue is good if your costs haven't increased a ton because your net income can fall anyway(in fact active/blizzards net income was in line with expectations). You can't judge a company's health based on revenue. 
---
It's easy to criticize and judge corporations when you have less understanding of how they work
---
Based on reports its mostly pr and esports people not actual devs 
---
I really cant recommend that.
---
GamezBDO is more of a build test server than actual game. The game is full of glitches and the exp is so fast that the games becomes confusing.
---
BDO is a brainless grind game. You play it because you enjoy grinding.
---
May sound stupid, but playing on 100xp servers will just take the experience away from you.
---
Announcement is not related to alliances. 
---
You leave my salad people alone!
---
ArenaNet does what Blizzardon't. 
---
&gt; permanent portable provisioner is a feature long forgotten by the devs, and only really useful for the big spender daily.
---
Even for that you only save 5 badges per Big Spender, instead of the buying a Badge of Tribute from any guild hall for 30 badges.
---
Ah, I miss not being there in that lineup, but Tarveth's time was due and he needed to advance a career outside the Warband. Maybe he should've petitioned the Centurion to be the Legionnaire of his own Warband under her banner....  
---
But this is great to see with some of the old faces but many of the new out front.   
---
I SALUTE YOU SHARD!
---
I stopped doing fractals after instability patch, mostly because of slippery slope. I dont't find it fun at all, and most of the new instabs range from obnoxious to annoying too.
---
Took me three years to get my first pre and it was the spear that i sold for 50 gold. Then it took about half a year and the incinerator dropped. I really wanted that one but i wanted the Meteorlogicus more. Was the first legendary weapon i saw someone had in game and it looked like he held the world in his hands and i said then that i have to have that. When the incinierator dropped i sold it and bought the pre for Meteorlogicus. After that i have had numerous of pre drop for me. There was one time were two dropped in just a week and one was from a Hero challange, crazy!
---
Anyway you will get more, don't worry :)
---
for a long time i just bought golems for that daily, because BoH are virtually worthless
---
I think I'd rather have the green looking cabbage instead of the dried grey one.
---
"We hear you."
---
It is not alliance related, they even stated that them self.
---
Would you like to send one of those to Portugal?
---
That work is simply amazing 
---
As a PvE-only player I never had more than a few hundred of them from achievement chests, so it's nice for a no-effort daily :) (and some glacial progress on a WvW reward track)
---
Wow, that’s incredible! You definitely have a lot of talent.
---
I checked out your Etsy shop and I’m so tempted to buy something. It’s all lovely!
---
They said a bug..  there could be multiple
---
People found hard PoF story instances, like for real, and in the end Anet had to nerf a few encounters.
---
&gt; I really have no idea how to level without It
---
Just run around the world, explore, do events. Everything gives exp. With stacked boosters I get like 2 levels during the 15-20mins I spend on daily event completer maps. (crowds upscale the events to have tons of enemies)
---
This right here is why snow crows isn't the rght place to send noobies to.
---
I think people missed the part where devs aren't the ones affected by the layoffs
---
If you care about the story and want to follow the plot, definitely yes. Otherwise, not that much necessary except for a few select maps.
---
However, you can buy ascended trinkets (amulet, ring, accessory and backpack) with the currency you obtain in these maps, and some of them are really easy to farm. Let me write a quick list of the most important ones.
---
* **Season 3 Episode 3 (Bitterfrost Frontier map):** This map's currency is extremely easy to farm, and you can buy ascended rings, accessories, backpacks and aquatic breathers.
---
* **Season 4 Episode 1 (Domain of Istan):** It's a pretty good map to farm mats and gold in general, but it got slightly nerfed as of late.
---
* **Season 4 Episode 3 (Domain of Kourna map):** This episode will let you unlock the Roller Beetle mount, otherwise unobtainable.
---
* **Season 4 Episodes 4 &amp; 5**: The interesting thing in these two are the mount masteries you can unlock. They'll let you perform more mount jumps/skills (Ep4) and dismount mid-air (Ep5), but don't offer any other advantage.
---
You can buy ascended trinkets in almost all maps, but keep in mind that some stats are locked to a certain Season. For example, in Season 3 maps you can get the Viper, Commander and Minstrel stats, to name a few. The most used ones in Season 4 maps are Harrier and Diviner.
---
Willie hears ya.  Willie don't care.
---
Not really sure that's true. Need dye channels made in the first place to dye something.
---
SPOILER: They didn't hear shit.
---
After the diablo announcement, communication sure needed fixin.
---
Good grief, Anet needs competent PR and community ppl more than anything.
---
I think you missed my point. HoT introduced the trinity because Druid was the first ever healing spec. Whether it's the best healer or what it brings in the current meta is absolutely irrelevant to this topic.
---
I got the beetle yesterday and for sure, it is so fun and getting drifts right is very satisfying. Cant wait till u unlock the tricks mastery

“We here at ArenaNet have thought extensively about how to handle WvW and what updates could make this game mode more enjoyable to the player base. Over the years, we acknowledge that our lack of updates has caused the WvW presence to drop severely and need to find a fix.
---
In an effort to make sure people are getting consistent updates, we have decided to scrap WvW entirely. We believe this change will be beneficial as it will allow previous WvW players to focus on the updates we make, specifically PvE and PvP. This change will allow the players to do a single instance of Istan farm and then join PvP for the same level of salt and toxicity they are accustomed to. 
---
We hope this change is for the better, since we have no intention of reverting it. “
---
Yeah, read like that, then read tweet, then read title again and didn't get how is Anet responsible for that. English is hard.
---
I’m the casual that thought someone got fired in a snow blizzard and Anet was responding to it?🤦‍♂️ lol I feel so dumb

He should be able to simply change his server for a cost of gems, correct?
---
Thanks
---
I just noticed I could get the whole S3 with just 720 gems (25% off) so the 1600 gem pack for 20€ was enough for S3 and S4. So I'm good now, thanks for the reply though, will save the tips for later (I'll definitely want to get the beetle, it's so fun)
---
Hey, did you know that the coming announcement isn't about the thing you mentioned? Do you? Are you sure you do? Like, really sure?
---
Do they? I feel like Devs would be a better investment, considering content comes out at a snail pace in the form of non-repeatable living world patches, which I don’t personally find interesting or enjoyable because the story isn’t great.
---
When I imagined GW2, I imagined a changing world. New events with each patch, fixing old events, removing outdated events, and making an actual “living world” that changes over time. I don’t think they delivered anything CLOSE to what I was expecting.
---
Their only saving grace is the fact that their combat system is one of the best I’ve ever seen, and yet, look at the state of WVW and SPvP. SPVP itself is a hot mess of balance issues and a dying base, due to lack of any interesting new developments. A new PvP Lobby was released last year... but we still have only one official game mode. Ranked queue is still duo queue. No queue for solo players, unless you want to be stomped.
---
The devs really dropped the ball. No amount of PR can really fix that.
---
Props to the guy that "applied as a build template specialist."
---
Thanks to adopting the leaf as legal tender, we have all of course become immensely rich.
---
However, we have encountered a small inflation problem on account of leaf availability. Therefore to revalue the leaf we intend to...burn down all the forests. 
---
You didn't post anything.
---
Am I the only one beeing upset that the list starts with B and A is missing?

Imagine if they hadn't put out a "please don't be excited" post before blizcon. Everyone would have expected d4, and got.... that.

I have heard they had become really competent in telling out of season april fools jokes tho.
---
After twice wiped at the room against air elemental+tornado today, everyone in my pug group left party out of frustration. Its not just because that part is harder as dodging with SS wont help you escape being pulled towards tornado, further encounter would be ridiculous as well with SS that its not worth all the frustations to complete it.

Can ascended armor from armor chests get a stat change through the normal process?  I am a recently returned player who was gone for about 5 years and am working on my first ascended set and was blessed [with this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ferratus%27s_Armor_Chest) but really want Viper stats for Firebrand action.  Not sure if all armor qualifies for the stat change, so just curious.
---
Thanks!
---
Hmmmm "Alexa, what happens to stock prices when you mass fire employees?"
---
Anet sends their regards
---
Yeah, I'm struggling to find truly "small things" that GW2 should implement. A lot of the more glaring issues that GW2 has or should implement are larger changes (player housing, Guild revamps, more underwater changes, etc.). Build templates are probably the smallest QoL on a lot of people's list, and even that isn't a small change.
---
I haven't exactly heard great things about working for blizzard either, though.
---
It could be the [Mini Stardust Jackal Pup.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mini_Stardust_Jackal_Pup)
---
What exactly found difficult? really?
---
QA is actually a very integral part of the development process. We are considered developers too :) just want to point that out! 
---
Didn't Blizzard not lay off anyone doing that stuff? It was all non-developmental? i.e. marketing
---
the company is a shadow of itself after it got acquired by activision, but before that? the portfolio of games you could include in your resume was awesome
---
Well ATVI is up 7% as of right now today.

&gt;Shoulda just sent it Scruffy
---
Get in the damn robot S627!
---
“Rains over Ascalon” plays in the background...
---
I see your points, but I don’t see how layoffs create better performance. Their games tanked because they were poorly implemented and execution was way off. Laying off 8% of support staff doesn’t fix that problem. 
---
Merci beacoup! I've always enjoyed these atmospheric, ambient videos which showcase GW2's narrative storytelling and stunning environments. Tyria is such a beautiful (and sometimes beautifully ugly and creepy when it comes to certain enemy areas) world, and it never ceases to amaze me how the artists manage to make each region so distinct with its own signature features so that we can easily figure out which part of the world we're in by just looking at each frame. Keep up the good work with your videos! :)

---
Yes, all ascended armor and weapons qualify. 
---
Welcome back!
---
All ascended armor qualifies for stat changes, you can change it to Viper using the standard Mystic Forge recipe of 5 Globs of Ectoplasm, 1 Anthology of Heroes, 1 Exotic Viper Insignia and the armor piece you want to change.
---
Keep in mind that both rune and infusion in that piece will be destroyed (but since it comes from a chest, it won't have anything of this). Also, for future reference, it also converts your piece to a "Standard" version, so if your piece is a precursor to the legendary set, it would lose the precursor status. Keep that in mind!
---
Meters per second vs miles per hour. Added mph because it is close to / breaks 100.
---
Well its cool tho, not like you oneshot like in WoW - you still die often even in old maps if you pull groups of enemys.
---
Better release schedule. Don't bundle everything into one. Release stuff when it's ready, not before that but don't delay things so updates are bigger. 
---
Stop wasting time on temporary content that could easily be permanent (the wintersday raid for example) and just make it permanent content instead.
---
The worst level I've played. It may be good as a challenge mote, but not fun at all as a daily.
---
yeah sorry, typo, it's 962% and 1112%
---
Layoffs are common in the game industry and a non compete clause would be a dick move.
---
One of them should learn how to update the engine and work with their in-house map making tools to update dungeons, if they are all devs.
---
Yeah I also checked the number and it's indeed what might be happening that the moment of the click on consume all the % is fixed. I still have 1900 envelopes which I'll probably open in the weekend, I'll get back to you with those figures. It would be very unlikely if I was this lucky twice.

You didn't address your improper use of a "fact" and use of analogy that has no relation. If you say there is a study, then the burden of proof lies on you to show that. Not that it has any relation to our original topic, STILL, about Mordremoth's design. Why should I care one way or the other if cars are slower or faster in cities? What does it have to do with the Jungle Dragon or GW2? If you need proof ANet is a Western company, check the wiki on the sidebar of this sudreddit, because the fact I used actually has relation to the game and original topic of this entire discussion.
---
Where did I say my statements were facts beforehand? I never used the word fact until you decided to crawl out of whatever hole trolls live in and start this heedless, one-sided rant of antipathy. We aren't debating whether or not Snaff died, we're talking about whether Mordremoth has a likable design.
---
&gt;Everything you wrote, you wrote as facts and you protected your "facts" by other "facts". Ofcourse it's your fault that ppl missunderstood that. Nobody knew you only were talking about your own opinion, because you told nobody.
---
The only person who is assuming this is you and you can speak only for yourself in full capacity. So if YOU had a misunderstanding, you can make that claim, but I would say any information has been relatively easy to understand up to this point. You just have some sort of personal problem, now. As for chilling the fuck out, you still need to. If one use of the word fuck is hurting you in your special little safe-space, I would take this as a sign to realize that maybe you need to re-sort your priorities in life.
---
It looks fine, but you probably don't need that much Diviner's gear if you use food and an oil and can swap some for Berserker's or whatever for more damage. 
---
I like the original better haha
---
Sorry for long question, but automod said I should comment here instead of post.
---
So I am a relatively new player, both the expansions, and at the moment of writing I have a mesmer lvl 80 with both elites, and a Ranger, thief, Revenant and an Elementalist in the early level ranges. However, I only have time to play casually and I don't think I will be able to even get close to really mastering another of the difficult classes as I did with my mesmer. And since I currently only have 5 char slots, I plan on deleting my ele and picking another class.
---
Now I am torn between two classes: Necro and guardian. Not engi, because that one is supposedly also pretty difficult, and not warrior, because I just don't feel attracted to it.
---
So my question is: is the skill floor for these classes indeed not too high, can I pick them up easily? And if yes, which one would you recommend?
---
Also, I have two level 80 boosts still lying around. On which classes (that I mentioned I had (or not)) would you use them? And why? 
---
you're right, but you can hold your pride when you can boost your carreer working for such company, while anet is mostly an entry-level dev employer
---
Currently have x10 32 slot bags on my mesmer. All of my important items are up top so they're never moved by compact inventory, while all my spare trinkets/armor peices/runes/infusions are at the bottom inside invisible bags.

Matchmaking for PVE content, like dungeons, raids and fractals. No more obnoxious killproof or requeriments, everyone is "anonymous" and some kind time penalty for rage quitters. Also official build templates.
---
If you are crafting a shit ton of any one thing, you are crafting inefficiently. Recipe discovery is where the crafting XP is, and it's one of GW2's crafting system strengths. You're not just checking boxes on a list (though most of the recipes are formulaic); you see that your stuff can be used and it's up to you to find what you're missing. It's not a little thing, but I like the way that FF14 handles crafting - it's a full profession, not just a side thing - with actions, abilities, and gear all its own. Gathering is well done there too, where you cannot even see the nodes unless you are the gathering class to harvest them. While GW2's gathering system is easy and open, I like the focus that FF14's system has - you go to gather, you're gathering; combat classes just do combat.
---
I had great fun watching as 2 people left before I even wrote "let's do solid ocean instead". 
---
I mean some people don't have anything against trying to do content for a long time. My first 100 CM run took 6 hours, but we managed to finish it somehow. I even liked it, I had plenty of time to understand and practice mechanics. The problem with group content is, that I can't do it alone. I'm gathering a fragile party of random people, who sometimes leave after one dumb wipe. This means I spend more time in lfg than actual fractal. I don't want content to be easy because of that. I want hard and challenging content, but not ridiculously broken and annoying content. I want to be punished for my and my teammates' mistakes, not for unlucky instability combo that makes people ragequit. 
---
Also, HoT and after really ramped up the difficulty of enemies everywhere in there respective content. But it gives you a real chance to learn your characters full in and outs. IMO it's awesome. 
---
A lot of CM and support roles got let go as well. As someone who works in software development, you don't realize how important some roles are until there's no one doing them.
---
I didn't say that I'd support the system, I just explained what it is in this case.
---
Why? Seems like they are safe with their jobs and Acti-Blizzard is one of the most successful gaming companies currently. Many describe it as their “dream job”.
---
I doubt there will be any sort of exodus from Blizzard in the form of developers.
---
BUILD TEMPLATES
---
I just did some statistical calculation (well some site google recommended did) and it appears that if we look at the golden trophies which are the main factor to determine your profit, I should get on average 247 of those based on a probability of 5.25% for 960mf (based on the 70k opening also here on reddit). It seems there is about 2% chance I'ld end up with 280 or more golden trophies (I had 280) so I guess on average for every 50 people doing this there should be one person this lucky.
---
1/50 people isn't an astronomical figure so this means I probably just got lucky. I do however will let you know how the last 1900 will go by opening them as I did before
---
The Standard Aquabreather in fact has 4 dye channels.
---
Here's the "trick" (requires 2 different aquabreather Skins):
---
- open hero panel
---
- Hide your headpiece
---
- go to Wardrobe and select an aquabreather skin that's different from your current one ( **don't** apply)
---
- now navigate to Dyes
---
The aquabreather will take on the colors of your headpiece and you can preview them. If you have a Helmet with 4 channels you will see the aquabreather will take on all 4.
---
https://pasteboard.co/I0Zg4eD.jpg
---
(my current headpiece only has 2 channels, but you get the point)
---
He says in OP he wants to polish it until end of February 
---
I think this is the best small summary of it I've seen yet.
---
Just to be clear, it's Wuff's art, not mine... I'm just the one who commissioned it.
---
Like I said, just a bunch of things I wasn’t expecting, Open world enemies that can stun lock you, NPC bosses that have more mechanics than a freaking God, that sort of thing.
---
yes, it is, with some exceptions. for instance, the first dungeon - Ascalonian Catacombs is the hardest first dungeon i experienced in ANY MMORPG i played. i was very surprised. being a wow player, i would compare it to at least M+5 keystone. Some fratals are extremely hard for noobs as well. even on first tier. 
---
on the other hand, you dont need to grind gear for PvP, you can start right away at level 2 or so. And gearing in general is not hard in GW2, you dont have to raid or do those hard fractals at all for ascended armor/weapons. They are all craftable. (well, some runes must be obtained from group content or pvp). 
---
Solid Ocean consists of running/skipping, short time clearing adds and then mostly waiting. Hardly an engaging or fun activity.
---
Hey guys,
---
Been playing GW2 for few weeks now and am ready to fully dive in to it after a year break. My questions are just a few and unrelated but would rather post it all in one post rather than spam the subreddit so here it goes.
---
* Does Griffon mount collection require a certain character who finished the PoF story to start it ? I want to do the collection on my new character I have been playing for the past few weeks but don't want to start PoF story yet as I wanna go through the correct order on the story(LWS2 HoT S3 etc...)
---
* Best way to get harrier trinkets? I checked some posts that are quite outdated by now as some say to wait for living world episodes etc. I have a few raiding shards (magnetite) which can be used i guess but is there a way like getting Vipers on LWS3 ?
---
Thats all i would like to know and thank you in advance for your answers!
---
Armor/weapons I never use except when screenshots call, and useless junk. #packrat
---
You can do bandit encoded orders to clear the item cache since it works as a cut scen btw.  Save yourself son WP fees and loading screen times
---
Oh I’m not up to there yet. Kinda curious how it works, but hopefully I won’t need it....hopefully :P

Copy the [Zaishen Menagerie](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Zaishen_Menagerie_Grounds) from GW1 so my ranger has a zoo where all my unlocked pets can frolic around.
---
While i'm at it...
---
* Obligatory GW1 build templates.
---
* Polymock from GW1 (But using your minipets)
---
* Make minipets wander around a bit similar to GW1
---
* Capes from GW1.
---
Not from GW1:
---
* Ability to initiate a duel/1v1 in open world. 
---
HoT is also worth it for gliding, especially if you wvw.

Sorry I guess I'll rephrase. I really don't know how to level without it in a way that doesn't make me want to paint the walls with my brains

Dynamic upscaling was present during betas [acc. to wikipedia](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dynamic_level_adjustment#Trivia)
---
In the normal add-on selection you can choose from: arcdps, buildtemplates and mechanics log (I'm going to add more depending on which are the most popular)
---
  
---
And in the "expert"-mode you can have **literally any add-on.**
---
My favorite funny line is...
---
&gt; **Agni Ironcrusher**: Did someone say beer? I've been sober so long, I can actually feel my face. I don't want to feel this face.
---
Yes, at the end of february I will follow up with another thread explaining every single feature and showing it all off.
---
It will be available for download at [https://guildlounge.com/](https://guildlounge.com/)
---
I've seen comments from devs that indicate they measure all of this internally in "Tyrian inches per second", which I assume is referencing range units. We were told a while ago that boosted beetle was 1800 Tips and griffon superspeed was 2000, but this kind of data on all mounts is certainly interesting to see. If I wasn't a broke student I'd gild you.
---
Anyway there's a story about how the griffon ended up being so fast, and it has to do with collision limits. The short version is that apparently things have the possibility of getting a little... weird... above about 2500 Tips.
---
For this reason the fact that you can hit 200 m/s with skill 8 in bloodstone fen gets my attention. Did you experience any strangeness doing this? I may have to test this myself...
---
While you're still learning the dungeons and fractals should provide moderate challenge, but if you want the proper challenging stuff (see: raids) you'll want to grab the expansions. They're occasionally on sale for up to 50% off + bundle deal, so look out for that while you're getting into the swing of things :3
---
This would be dope, i imagine it will drive down transmutation charge sales though. (Not that it matters for a big part of the playerbase that  gets free charges through PvP/WvW.)
---
This happens all the time though among the game studios. .. usually I see this posted on Facebook and talents share it around now and then.
---
Not much to do with capitalism, really. They're already profiting. If they don't realize that they're playing with a market that has limits, they're just being plain stupid.
---
I may have been making an assumption based on consume all vs auto clicking... maybe it is possible due to it being faster.  I’ll try this out later.
---
Im not really into all the types of bags and never really dealt with all the different ones. I have 8 normal ones and 2 invisible ones. All 20 slots, cuz 32 is way to expensive for what you get.
---
nice one :)

---
We did this a week or so ago and wanted to make a better time before revealing, but guess the cat is out of the bag now.
---
You know that there are seperate pr teams for different games, right?
---
Sure it took a little longer than on normal days but it was fun. Seeing ppl and myself slide of a dozen times at the mace xD fun to watch tbh. Also it makes ppl comunicate and talk to each other..
---
Why allways complain if stuff is not instaclear easy faceroll.
---
Just unsing your brain and watch where you step for 10 to 15min should´nt be that hard.
---
 I would say its super friendly to noobs. I started it as my first MMO a month ago, and so far it's been great. Its easy to find people willing to help out or answer questions. I haven't had any issues finding a group for world bosses. I die a lot still, but haven't received any flack for it. To date I've only encountered one person who was a bit of a jerk, and even then someone else nearby was willing to help me instead (I cannot figure out jumping puzzles to save my life).
---
I found the early story stuff to be easy enough, it gets more challenging over time. Dungeons are a little harder, even with help. Difficult enough to make you think about what you're doing, but not frustratingly so. 
---
Have fun!

"Time Start: 2019-02-06 21:53:24 -5"
---
Pretty scuffed Boon Thief gameplay, you could've really thought about it more. Black Powder and Smokescreen are huge overall DPS increases, proccing Inepitude randomly. Without that only running Sword Pistol is just poor effort. Sword Dagger is a huge personal DPS increase comparatively.
---
Lay-offs are done if you don't need the workers. Simple as that. Sometimes you have to lay off employees because your company is going under. But that is actually quite rare. Mostly it's simply about the company just not needing the employees any more.
---
This is exactly what is supposed to happen in a capitalist system.
---
You make me sad :(
---
Lol
---
But at least she got a song out of it.  You know, the one they made Fur Elise...
---
Why is that?
---
With all respect, if having a civilized discussion is this hard to you (instantly labeling different viewpoints as circlejerk) maybe it's time to look in the mirror.
---
The other comment never said there aren't toxic people, there always are some.
---
"Aradune is stinky"
---
I think it was a cat or dog? I’ll take a look through the wardrobe again today too
---
Endgame content + no P2W
---
It is the definition of capitalism. If they believe, that they can maximise profits by firing 800 people, that's exactly what they are supposed to do. And if they believe that they can maximise profits by hiring a new CFO for 15 million, that's also what they are supposed to do.
---
According to Blizzard they cut some departments to hire more Devs.
---
It seems like you are doing Low level fractals or Low level pug for raid. Everyone with a little Experience knows that you can't ignore downed players 
---
wait, so is the log time inconsistent or consistently incorrect?  
---
And the CFO bonus is no argument for not firing 800 employees if you don't need them anymore.
---
Noo wayyy :O..., but thank you!!! :D I am very happy you like it.
---
i guess you haven't played PoF, 'cause LS4 is the same difficulty as PoF imo
---
This is so beautiful! please make it again so I could buy it for myself.
---
or you can get both for 1.14g on the TP
---
This is situational. If someone is downed early on in the fight, the DPS can expect someone else to revive them. 
---
The literal definition of capitalism is profiting from something, not necessarily *maximizing* profits.
---
There are a few new instabilities like the new social awkwardness and the iterations of flux bomb and mists convergence, but there are a few like outflanked (inconsistent registration dependent on latency at times with extreme punish, birds (frankly annoying to waste dodges on and still be panlized), and slippery slope that have made me annoyed with fractals since the patch. I prefer they rework these or simply change them out for a better idea. 
---
why was this post necessary?
---
Automated que system for dungeons, at least story mode.
---
&gt;If people go down. You resurrect them. Always. It may impact your personal DPS, but it impacts the whole squad's DPS much more if someone dies.
---
You know what impact your whole squad's DPS even more? Two people going down.
---
While I get what you are trying to say, resurrecting someone in a situation where it would lead to you yourself getting downed is usually not the best idea. 
---
Don't forget an interface you can customize and grace periods to reconnect to your old map instance. I really don't understand why they removed some of the QoL features GW had while making GW2.
---
You would be unpleasantly surprised. 
---
&gt;Far too often I see someone downed with only one person trying to rez them. Remember that resurrecting is faster for each person attempting to do so: it's much faster with all 5 people than it is with only 1. 
---
I don't think it's faster when the Boss starts spamming AE on the downed.
---
''Yo dawg, I heard you needed a job''
---
How do you know THAT wasn't just PR, huh? 
---
Ew. Rip.
---
Nobody ever forgets their first group of pocket raptors, or smokescale... 
---
Thank you!! I also sell and ship my art to Portugal. More of my art can be found on [etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Elfenschein). I also gladly accept commissions there.
---
Thank you very much!! :)
---
99CM is rather easy...
---
**If you can use your brain properly.**
---
/sarcasm
---
You have a *dps check* in 99CM since you need to solo kill an Add without your team helping you.
---
So you kind of need at least some training / knowledge of your classes dps rotation. As for builds you don't need to run meta ones truly, they're build around an ideal group composition and permanent boon uptime. So if you get CC'd or lack some buffs (Dragonhunter without Retaliation for example) you will find yourself lacking performance.
---
I usually end up swapping my skills, traits and weapons all the time according to bosses.
---
If my team could use Stability boon in a particular fight I'll provide it, same goes for Reflection etc.
---
You need to anticipate the boss encounter and if you wipe you change your setup depending on whats needed or whats your group lacking.
---
You kind of need to look at the bigger picture and what is required to make a fight run as smooth as possible. Its dumb running core meta builds without twerking them and then dieing all the time while running your head into a wall.
---
Get to know your class, look at the boss --- *THINK*
---
If you play dps your job is not to win the competition. You can contribute more to your group than damage.
---
Most Damage Dealer Meta builds are focussed around dps only.
---
So take lesser effective traits/skills out and get additional support.
---
Evaluate whats needed...
---
Btw there are YouTube tutorials too - watch them so you know whats going to happen and how to counter.
---
T4 is about adapting to situations, CM is added personal performance.
---
Because obviously resurrecting people makes them target the downed people. You know that if multiple people resurrect, it's really fast? For your strawman to be true, it would have to take much longer than it currently does.
---
No, the definition of Capitalism is: "an economic and political system in which a country's trade and industry are controlled by private owners for profit, rather than by the state"
---
And yes, that means maximising profits. Of yourse it does. Companies are not charities. And they are not supposed to be. The main point is that a free capitalist market is the most effizient way to get the most out of the resources you have. That's the whole idea behind it.
---
Expecting companies to not fire people they don't need anymore is the opposite of this. And will bankrupt companies in the long-run because they can't compete in the marketplace anymore.
---
If you actually want to change something, you have to change the system.
---
Thank you!! :) I am glad you both like my glowing flower art.
---
This is exactly what my partner and I did this last week.  He's a decade+ wow player and I spent the last six months leveling my first toon to 120.  Turns out I decently liked the leveling process but definitely do not find much fun in end game and raiding.  So here we are.  I'm loving the depth of GW2.
---
Generally resurrecting with multiple people tends to be fast enough to avoid such situations. 
---
They should invest in some revive orbs.
---
- in a lot of cases it is faster and more secure to kill a tagged mob so the person can rally
---
- in a lot of cases the downed person did go down for a reason, namely bad positioning. risking more people going down is not beneficial to anyone.
---
outside of this, you are correct.
---
It doesn't make a lot of sense realistically, but in terms of mechanics that sounds about right. You can hit things pretty far out from you, which is good because it would be a nightmare to have to navigate realistically close for an attack. If you like you can also view it as an abstraction for the lines lunges and thrusts in real melee combat, which provide a lot more range than standing straight and holding a knife in an outstretched hand. Ranged attacks are even more unrealistic at scale: rifles that only shoot 100 feet before the bullets peter out, with the most long-range weapons managing only 125.
---
3.3% gain. Niiiiice
---
I think sadly, people will just get kicked if this happens? Unless they lock it behind certain requirements. 
---
People will most likely put their KP requirements in squad message and expect people to join, check, ping, or leave. 
---
Also, I think this will make people much much more generous in kicking people, as long as there still is a commander in the squad. New players are less likely to purchase a com tag and tag up for a raid, so most commanders will be rather veteran, they will certainly not want to carry new players, resulting is more kicks.
---
IMO, the best case, is for Anet to make a matchmaking for training and a match making for clearing, where the training MM matches 3 trainer volunteers with 7 actual new players. This will prob work, tho idk about trainer population. 
---
Also, specialized roles will be a nightmare for this MM system. This essentially locks roles into a game where the roles are very flexible. Would the matchmaker change requirements for a handkiter? What about ezpz NA strats like ranged deimos? There is no way this MM system will work out.   
---
Wouldn’t that be bad for the majority of raiders I’ve only 17 
---
Pso2 level of skimpy outfits.
---
Stop with the bullshit western hypocracy of bullshit morality. That shit pisses me off so much. 
---
Plus a smart group would read the situation and rez so long as it is safe to do so, and not during an important mechanic or 'death floor' situation 
---
only thing i'm with u is the smokescreen for the mirages (i never played sword dagger maybe it's more dmg &lt;40% idk)
---
Shit, I didn't even have a chance to *remember* my first few smokescales.
---
Legit thought it was an environmental effect that basically insta-killed you randomly.
---
That still does depend on the situation. There are situations where you basically go down in a second when in a certain position, and even with multiple people rezzing it will take longer than a second. 
---
Nice video, bro! 
---
There are mobile mmo's? Like what?
---
Many thanks!! :)
---
Not really, other than one or two exceptions, I found PoF to be really easy.
---
Thank you!!!
---
Imo this is where trade offs come in. For example, as a druid main, in raids I have a hard time on any high pressure fight validating myself rezzing others.  Because when I’m reviving 1 person, no one else is getting my heals other than regen and/or nature spirit if it is summoned for some reason.
---
In those scenarios it’s much better for me to heal everyone so no one else goes down while the person who is down gets rezzed.
---
I had to fight with someone in our static over this for about a month (he was dps focused and always pushing for the #1 spot in the team) and kept claiming dps should never rez and only healers should.  So one week, I religiously rezzed people until everyone was up.  Any time someone else went down it snowballed into a wipe.  That was the tipping point of showing how it was more beneficial for the healer to heal instead of rez (for high pressure fights/situations)
---
I wish anet would just take a step back and acknowledge that instabilities that rotate randomly aren't fun. I wish they would make fixed instabilities for Fractals or remove them completely and make them harder by their own. 
---
I also would recommend Guardian, Dragonhunter presses 4 skills and is up there with 60k burst dps.
---
According to anets road map we are going straight into LW-S5 after S4, with the episodes prone to delays we could be looking at 1 map every 4-5 months for the next several years.
---
When i ask my 5 irl friends when they are thinking of coming back their answers are all the same "will return for the next x-pak". This doesn't bode well for anets earnings.
---
The best thing anet could do at this point in time is get GW3 out for the start of the next console generation, cross platform play and proper controller support could bring in a lot of cash.
---
Well, maybe the issue is in being druid. Other classes can heal better and also ress at same time. Tempest or Necro come in mind...
---
But well, that probably is an issue of going more for offensive support than actually getting meta healer. Quite dangerous trade off, but as long as it works :)))))
---
Two dP's, one EU and one NA.
---
NA dP pulled the sneaky log and should now hold the record
---
Its evolving...
---
or you can just put them on a shared slot when you salvage stuff
---
Thank you!! I spent countless days on experimenting with materials and practicing shaping and coloring. I used wire (bent by hand) for the frame of the petals and leaves and glued colored mulberry paper on it. Then I painted patterns on each leaf. The stand itself is made out of wire of different strenghts and floral tape. A finishing coat of acrylic varnish gives the whole sculpture a protective layer + gives the petals and leaves a glasslike, glossy effect.
---
GW2's raiding roles are too specialized to have a MM system. 
---
0. The existance of Ren/Brand vs Druid Chrono
---
1. Handkiter, 
---
2. oilkiter (ew), 
---
3. tank, offtank (god dammit w6), 
---
4. split condi/power damage que (VG), 
---
5. portal slave (tho mesmers could do it, fucks up the ren/brand combo tho), 
---
6. entangle slave (RIP any class other than druid who wants to heal), 
---
7. flak kiter (again druid could do this, it's just not really recommended), 
---
8. group stun-breaker, 
---
9. reflect slave (aka mirages), 
---
10. TOWER CHRONO WOOOOOOOOO (Rest in peace ren/bran),
---
11. Orb pusher (Any class can do it, druid is one of the rare ones who can do it from range)
---
12. Xera pre spirit revive strat (This one is weird, you can do it the way it was intended, but everyone and their mother knows only the druid way...)
---
13. Space aids + shards kiter, 
---
14. Epi, or ranged clear,
---
15. Pusher + entangle spam, 
---
16. fuck the rest. 
---
True, I personally only have the 2 shared spots you get for free, and I keep my copper and silver fed salvage-matics there.
---
I just turned level 13 last night! I've done some of the character story but really just like roaming around and doing my own thing.  I have too much stress at work to be stressed out about a game (one of the big reasons I did not like raiding in wow, but that's another vent lol). 
---
Dispossession (on NA) has the faster Kill
---
Digging Even Deeper (no EU) we are only second place now
---
I have no idear how many other guilds have this tag but i can assure you we came up with it [independently](https://www.dict.cc/englisch-deutsch/independently.html)
---
Thank you!! :) You can find me on etsy under the name "Elfenschein". 
---
Keyba's tourneys are fun. Do them. 
---
That's how Sylvari are made
---
Good on arena nets part. I think we are watching blizzard die... they've screwed up to many things recently. Time to start the next chapter RIP Blizzard Entertainment 
---
Yea exactly, we don't need a post like this every day. One of these items is extremely niche and most players would have no use for, the other item is worth less than a pact scout's mapping material.
---
I guess so.  So it's not like going up to a grieving widow and saying "sorry for your loss, you're kinda hot, here's my number"?
---
yeah, but you can swap them during the salvage, and then put the matics back after you're done
---
Just give me ALL the Mirages
---
In my 6 months of PvP to grind the legendary wings, I've never encountered what you encountered. I play both Ranked and Unranked, but more Ranked when it's in season.
---
Spawn camp? Yeah **occasionally**. I've been on both sides of spawn camping but it's always triple capped to make the match end ASAP.  
---
Unfortunately you met a party of douchebags. The best thing to do is to ignore and not give them the satisfaction for their behaviour. Just tab out and do something else in the mean time.
---
Never thought to eat brains almost everyday.
---
I would need 3 shared inventory slots to successfully do that (Yellow Green and Blue stacks), so at that point an invisible bag is just making a whole lot more sense and doesn’t cost IRL money or much swapping to pull off.
---
Those don't work in raids. 
---
This is true. But I wish people weren't so pedantic. The point is clear. 
---
I think it might actually be a limitation of how the "Slippery Slope" mechanic is applied to floors and I think that elevator does not count as a 'floor'. If you lay down traps as a guardian I noticed that the spinning effect your trap makes will appear above you as you travel downwards. I bet the same goes with the slippery slope mechanic is applied. It probably is applied above you since you travel down.
---
I would say yes as a new player myself. Been playing for around 4 months and learned a lot. The community is super friendly. In GW2 the community is so nice I prefer to be as kind as I can since the feeling gets reciprocated. In league of legends though I’m toxic. Be a good person and everyone else will treat you with high regards. I also recommend joining a guild with a discord. It builds the community in a positive light
---
and op said the guy has a lvl80 boost from buying HoT
---
What exact 20 slot is that cheap?
---
And not just a new CFO, he was the CFO a year ago : )
---
Good job with the anatomy :o
---
or actual devs for that matter
---
I thought you were saying you really liked that guild message if the day... until I saw your own comment.
---
Some classes definitely have it tougher than others. When I first started playing (at release), I tried to play as an elementalist, solo, and that was rough. I switched to necro and never looked back.
---
I think a good starter class is ranger, since they get a pet that can tank most veterans with little issue.
---
So it depends on what people choose initially that determines how easy they may have it.
---
I have been out of the loop for a while. Can someone explain to me where all the boons come from and how they get transferred to others?
---
This game is pegi 12. You're not allowed to play it yet
---
Thank you very much!! The one pictured got sold already, but I will definitely craft more of such in the near future. On [etsy](https://www.etsy.com/shop/Elfenschein) I will regularly offer my artwork and also gladly accept commissions. 
---
Slippery Slope has made taking people new to fractals through T4s painfully difficult. Newbies learning mechanics, trying to avoid various AOEs, slams, swipes, etc. **while** having to contend with carefully controlling their character? JFC, it's god awful. 
---
It frustrates the teachers, but more importantly **it discourages the people learning**. Why have something that turns new people off? 
---
Off-chrono is literally just the chrono who isn't tanking. You need to to make the combo work so one doesn't have to tank
---
private chat rooms
---
shopping cart in checkout
---
build templates
---
wardrobe templates
---
customisable tool bar
---
customisable UI (and let modders change them)
---
Then I'll find another group?
---
Don't bother with the downvotes from reddit, buddy. I've seen your youtube channel and the videos are really great. You seem to be very skilled with warrior and have good editting skills too. You got a new sub.
---
Keep up the good work! 
---
Maybe their CMs weren’t doing a good job communicating with the communities, or they want a more direct dev-community relationship who knows.
---
What about this then? https://imgur.com/a/ORuTJgJ
---
Savage but true.
---
I'm dancing around 200 charges and can't find anything else that I want to change on my characters.
---
Dude you seriously rule. Looking forward to producing more content for folks like you. What’s your IGN? 
---
just in case, you need to download it from [https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/x64/](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/x64/) . make sure that it is latest which is feb 2nd right now. then, try putting d3dl file in bin64 but without build templates. see if it works
---
Universal basic income.
---
Congrats!
---
Here's a tip: don't bother the game is dead
---
find something else to play
---
That's what makes every other MMO worse and feel like a job.
---
Hey Nice vid ! I'm just starting with pvp myself as a spellbreaker , and I have a few questions .
---
How do you deal with Mesmer's and condi damage ?
---
and also how do you choose between mend and healing signet ? and between endure pain and balanced stance ?     
---
Adding skinning would flood the leather economy and crash the price. So I'd be nervous about that one. But the rest I love.
---
There is a keybind that allows you to put a crosshair above a target and another key that allows you to select that target.
---
Oh sweet! Right, yes I forgot to mention that. When I was trying for the alpha beetle I also killed that big beetle on the ledge but I wasn't sure if that had any correlation to the event, like you said it didn't work every time. 
---
Yeah, I got the main ones I want for now. There's a few others but they are out of my reach for now.
---
I work in the industry and Blizzard has a reputation for paying lower than they should for a lot of positions until you start climbing the ranks a bit.
---
This is the thing I’d like the most. Essentially custom outfits. Especially if you could apply the look of other armor classes. I know we can’t mix and match heavy, medium, and light like SWTOR, that’s a separate issue, but if you could make a formal attire look from light armor it’d be fun to be able to use that “outfit” on a heavy armor character for role playing or what have you.
---
I really wish there were more things locked behind achievements. I love achievement hunting.
---
Considering the comment you were replying to is a complaint about cosmetics, and you imply that people are stupid for praising the raid wing for its cosmetics, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make here. Priorities = cosmetics &gt; cosmetics?
---
maybe i dont get it but why would anyone choose to not wear heavy armor when it just has superior defensive stats?
---
Thank you! I will offer more of such in the future on etsy. You can find me there via "Elfenschein". :)
---
There are so many possible variables I suggest you record your tests.
---
Wow, your poor charr looks really uncomfortable. 
---
I would friggin LOVE that Polymock with minipets thing. It doesn't have to a direct Polymock lift but the same idea.
---
Also, and this is somewhat off topic, but am I the only one who thinks it would be awesome to have a 'Mini Commander?' A mini that looks just like your player character but in mini form.
---
My fav thing to do in wow was solo old raids for xmogs  but anet hardly has any skins in the game anyways :( any kind of further character customization from pretty much any game out there would be an improvement. The fast that 90% ish of each characters withen a given profession is just straight up sad 
---
&gt; You didn't address your improper use of a "fact" and use of analogy that has no relation. If you say there is a study, then the burden of proof lies on you to show that....
---
So you still try to discuss about that example? 
---
You still say "That's why I think people took issue with it" is an explanation that all your statements are only your own opinion? heh...
---
&gt;The only person who is assuming this is you and you can speak only for yourself in full capacity.
---
Lol, I was **not** the only one who answered you... scroll up and you will see.
---
&gt;You just have some sort of personal problem, now. As for chilling the fuck out, you still need to. If one use of the word fuck is hurting you in your special little safe-space, I would take this as a sign to realize that maybe you need to re-sort your priorities in life.
---
Excuse me, but wtf is wrong with you? Do you need to talk shit about other ppl, because you can't help other ways?
---
I mean, it's kinda usual for some kinds of ppl to start insulting and start writing shit about the opposite -including "playing psychologist" like you did - , when they have no arguments left and think they will "lose" the discussion. 
---
But is that really necessary for you? I mean we both already know, that your whole discussions with everyone were a bunch of missunderstandings, because you pretend your own opinion to be facts. (Never said you did that on purpose btw.) So what's the point for you to keep this conversation up? Complaining about an unimportant example? Arguing with the fact, that I'm the only one who answers to you? Playing psychologist, because you have nothing left to say? Because that's what you do here. 
---
Buy the new wings backpack and glider, they look amazing :D
---
Thank you! I will experiment some more with turquoise tones. :)
---
Yeah...that would a be a problem.
---
Jokes on you, I got all of them through PvP reward tracks
---
"Hey, let's hire people behind Blizzard's recent PR and ongoing e-sports fuckups!"
---
its called cantha. 
---
Game is, community isn't.
---
I'm beginning to think I may have. The company I started working for last year has A LOT of veteran employees, little turnover, and our HR department is freaking amazing. A staffed cafeteria, employee events, and a decent commute (unless you are like me and have to cross the bridge). I dunno, as far as companues that treat their employees right go I haven't seen anything this good before. 
---
anet has their own esport successes to be proud of every day :)
---
More meaningful horizontal progression. This is the number ONE thing that would keep me interested in the long term.
---
Downvoted for stating my opinion, further proving my point, I am honestly done with this garbage subreddit.
---
On the flipside, my Asura could not be more comfy in that chair. It's like a couch for them.
---
The damage formula is the following:
---
&gt; Damage = (Weapon strength * Power * Skill coefficient) / Armor

Extracted from [its wiki page.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Damage_calculation)

Same here, I got the "dungeoneer" title and I think I did 1~2 runs of each dungeon path.

Not really. The amount of people who played gw1 then and want Cantha due to nostalgia is nothing compared to warcraft 3 audience.
---
my shit cant talk, how can yours be so special
---
Elite skills could have been so much more (they were billed as gamechanging during vanilla's promotion) as well as a proper design of breakbars and a debuff system that isn't just "this debuff is just a worse version of hard cc on a boss, otherwise it's completely useless".
---
They also could have invested into the idea of combo actions and field. But as with everything, they rush an idea, release it half-baked, then move on to the next gimmick because Anet is a collection of disjointed teams that move on from project to project and don't seem to have any unity in terms of combat systems or class design.
---
How old is the character? 
---
If it's more than 2 years, ooof.
---
My account has 2 years over my oldest character because I made that mistake. Now I'm 2 years behind on birthday gifts.
---
But what if I don't care about dungeon skins?
---
If they increase the dungeon achieve rewards to 10 from 5g, maybe I'll do daily dungeons.
---
They got fired for a reason... 
---
Does wardrobe unlock even count for that? Unlocking the cultural pieces doesn't count for the cultural achievements.
---
Yeah this is the way to go, if he hasn't moved before just transfer for free
---
WoW and League have changed as much as GW2. The maps, the characters and the models are more detailed every time, but there is never a big change in the engine.
---
Thank you!! You can find me on etsy via "Elfenschein". I gladly accept commissions there as well.
---
You also need for specific runes like Monks runes or Nightmare ones
---
Yeah they definitely get taken advantage of I agree. It'd be great if they could get a union like voice actors.
---
Those are showing, yes. 
---
I'm going to check out your Etsy page right now! You are talented
---
Because they projected a much larger, unrealistic profit goal which they didn't hit, canceled esports on hots, and want room to bring on more game developers. Community managers and esports teams were the ones laid off.
---
Like I get people liked Ythisens since he was the CM chosen to post on the forums but he wasn't a top CM and was the newest CM hence why he was the one laid off. 
---
My only complaint is that Warcraft Reforged should have been icing on the cake of a bigger announcement.
---
I would gladly pay 100gems per slot for this, AND use tmute charges to change it later.
---
99% of the employees fired were marketing/sales/support. Not very relevant to what they're looking for. 
---
why should the chronos extend them? one single thief does that job alone. thats the point of boonthief
---
Though all the people laid off were in e-sports and Blizzard Publishing (Community, Marketing and Communications...yes it's a weird name for the department) and not a single actual dev.
---
Well I never heard of your tool, and mine does far more than just showing raid progress and KP. Additionally my tool is under development since last year with the earliest test build being from November.
---
Specifically Blizzard from what I hear. Activision is all the way in LA and they're a different type of publishing than what I'm doing.
---
Not just blizzard, but activision-blizzard.
---

Being able to completely resize/reposition/remove ALL OF THE UI however we want, disable names/mastery points/guild/title etc from people you're partied with and remove all the cancer and overwhelming skill effects from other people.
---
AFAIK Blizz still uses MPQ file format made by MO
---
Queensdale, gendarren fields are the worst zones
---
Unfortunately some of their best CMs were axed, some who people are deeply saddened to see go because they were so active and friendly. The one (Lead CM) that has done a terrible job at communicating with the communities, however, has kept his job. 
---
and talking cabbages.
---
one thing about the cheat nabster (long since deleted by the creator) was that the ui of the cheat had a speedometre, showing actual speed of movement. blish hub, if it ever gets released will have this feature too.
---
Glad I'm not alone.
---
bruh you cant just sit down out there in the wilderness. That Warg's gonna f\*\*\* you up
---
Your arguments can't be understood if they don't hold relevance to GW2 and the original point of discussion about Mordremoth being a thicc boi and not similar to all other aspects of previous Elder Dragons. Cars in cities and the rate at which they travel correspondent to population level within the city has what to do exactly with any of that? You have nothing left to say because you never stayed on topic in the first place. You tried to start debating using logical fallacies, mainly strawman, by attempting to misrepresent the subject at hand using your car analogy. By completely fabricating your own unrelated argument you can more easily attempt to defend your position as being reasonable, but this kind of dishonesty undermines rational debate. You don't have an argument. You've created an imagined reality where you are persecuted in a scenario you yourself invented. Don't ever have a formal timed debate because you will just get shit on.
---
Pet Battle system from WoW.
---
Each pet belongs to a family (like insects, mammals, toads, birds etc) and has its strengths and weaknesses. You can level up pets via battles and compete in various fighting challenges or against other players. Sounds simple on surface but has a great layer of depth.
---
running wine?
---
It's under the same philosophy as leveling a combat class. Why waste time with trash and bosses in a dungeon if I'm going to be an adventurer? Just go to the entrance and get loot and xp for succeeding a gear check. /s
---
You do have other ways to get ascended, like fractals, so crafting is not even 100% necessary. It's just the most reliable way. At least here, repeated crafting a (like processing mats to building block materials) goes faster each time and you can salvage those "useless" items from level 1 to get some of the mats back, unlike every other MMO. Yes, it is a material sink, but it is necessary when players aren't forced to fight over tagging nodes and everybody gets their share of everything.
---
Mystic forge crafting has its place for special items, but I'm glad the system is more complex than an item based vendor. It would feel more like an accumulation of skill if it was more ability based, but that's what I suggested above and it's not a small change.
---
ANet generated more than enough hype at various points ... problem is delivering on that.
---
They didn't. Vivendi did, while they owned Blizzard. They went with the name "Activision Blizzard" to get the renown from it, but at that point the company was as good as gone other than in paper.
---
And they did because any company in the stock market works to make profit for the shareholders, clients, employees and brand be damned.
---
The waves of mobs during the cannon phases are fun. The adds during the final boss fight are just rude. 
---
Deal.
---
I'll be honest, this will never get done and even if they say it's "on the table" it will be the absolute last thing... 
---
Add also trapping. And cooking would craft bait.     
---
Bait would be used for both fishing and trapping. 
---
Then you could set a trap in certain areas around the world, come later and see what you trapped and skin it. 
---
Different kinds of bait would attract different game and fish, and some legendary fishes would only be caught with particular bait. 
---
And sometimes when fishing and trapping you could trigger events to fight angry creatures that spawned from it, like a very angry veteran krait that bit your bait, or a champion bully jotun who has decided they want for themselves whatever you trapped. 
---
Oh. And to craft bait you would have to use a new material: Food Crumbs.   
---
Crumbs would be obtained by salvaging any food. The rarer and more valuable the foods, the more crumbs it would produce when salvaged, with small chance for a few rare materials also used to craft special bait. 
---
This way all those worthless dishes filling the trading post would be bought in troves to salvage! 
---
You are a genius!
---
Me too! And I'm not saying the milestone skins aren't great in their own right, but that there just isn't much incentive to do achievements or rather to grind out the ones that are just super annoying to complete. I would love simple things.. such as completing all of the 'Weapon Master' achievements unlocked unique skins for the weapons after their 5k kills, or even if there were unique dyes locked behind achievements.  Just little things that feel worth the effort
---
What? Queensdale is probably the best starting zone in the game. Human is most popular race so it's the most active starting zone for beginners. It also has a lot of dynamic events to do while leveling. It is really quick to 100% complete with only 1 heart being tedious. It has a dungeon. 
---
None of the core tyria maps are that exciting tbh, but I'd put queensdale up near the top half of maps. 
---
I loved the ones in Divinity: Original Sin on Cyseal. I named my ele after one of them!
---
Honestly there is no great way, you can mention it on the forums too, but again it's up to Anet solely. Also they are never going to accept your coding for them. 
---
&gt; Then you could set a trap in certain areas around the world, come later and see what you trapped and skin it.
---
I this. I like this a lot, actually.
---
While I agree with every point you brought up, marketing and community interaction are still among the most important things to keep in mind in the gaming industry.
---
The past years have shown that Guild Wars 2 isn't really a topic outside of, well, Guild Wars 2. Some players in other MMOs know that it exists but that's essentially it. The game also kinda lost it's identity. Yes it does several things much better than its competitors, but it's very bad at keeping people in. Drawing new players in is therefore of even bigger importance and I don't really think they are doing enough to advertise their product.
---
The Guild Wars 2 core concept has proven to be problematic. They made a game that is the opposite of a gear treadmill - while that has advantages, it also has disadvantages. Anet openly encourages players to play for a while, drop out for some months, and come back, because "your gear will not have been invalidated".
---
This is a horrible point of view for an MMO. Such a MMO survives solely on the bond within communities that are forming. But not being able to give a lookout for stuff coming in 2019, aka a roadmap, 3-4 months between story updates that you play through in one weekend, beautifully crafted throw-away maps, total neglect of fresh additions to PvP and WvW, epicly long droughts between Raid releases... is just plain bad and drives players away faster than they are coming in.
---
Communicating with the community is such an important part. We will know about the next LS episode likely 1-2 weeks before it ships. The game could be discontinued next week and we still wouldn't get a notification in advance. It's just... terrible on the communication part.
---
Not if you don't make it on every animal, but only those killed in a particular way. 
---
For example, we could have trapping also added. And there would be spot across the world where you can set 1 trap, and have a limited set of traps worldwide total. 
---
Then you would revisit those traps, and they would have turned into a node you can skin to get some random materials including leather, meat, bones, claws, fangs, venom, blood, etc.  
---
woops yeah I think you're right. jeez, so which one was Drifts?
---
Really this, if build templates, more character slots and many other QoL features are not happening, this def won't. 
---
Mine's super simplistic. X, Y, Z, all-component speed, XZ speed, Y speed, record button.
---

Hate the aesthetics besides godlost swamp, hate the race, and I dislike human players . In my opinion stRter zone that’s best is caledon then metrica then ashford, queensdale and wayfarer 
---
yh they are even stronger in wvw thanks to skill split, druid also has a lot of kiting potential w/stealth
---
Who knows? /s
---
Barber shop.
---
They used to be set in stone, but people complained that it got boring after awhile. Just goes to show that you get what you wish for.
---
Wow! Thank you so much!
---
Yupp, stealth played a big role in them surviving for so long. They also had reveals so our stealth was worthless against her lol. So it was just three DPS's floundering as this Druid starts picking us off one-by-one, until a better lockdown class came along lol!
---
Yes it will be shut down one day, no it won't be soon. 
---
not played GW2 since 2012/2013 and thinking of getting back into the game for pvp. can someone explain linked worlds in WvW? do they stay the same or does it shift every so often? i played on a teir 1 WvW server and from looking at the rankings it appears that BG clearly has a stacked deck. How is WvW nowadays on T2/T3 worlds?  
---
Who's """arguing"""?
---
Considering GW1 is still running....
---
GW2 is NCsoft's only relevant western product. Wildstar was in agony for years before they pulled the plug. GW2 is nowhere near that state. Even though I'm personally bored with the game after six years and I do not believe it's going to grow anymore, it's still solid product with healthy playerbase and especially good deal for new players (not so much for veterans).
---
why is everyone asking for faster releases?? every 3 months is a damn  much of stuff, with a whole new map every time and  even patches in between.. honestly I would love to see releases  cut to only every 6 months. so I could catch  up anyhow..  I have 7k hours gametime and still tons of shit to do, and every 3 months it get more and more .\_.
---
End game content that isn’t buttcake easy. 
---
gw1 is significantly cheaper to run
---
I understand wanting to protect your source code, but they could expose some of their API calls without having to reveal their implementation.  Such as only providing header files.  
---
ANet could oversee all poll requests before pushing it to their build.  This would alleviate a lot of the work load, and vastly extend GW's functionality (and even stability!)
---
I made more money in Q4 of 2018 than Aion.
---
I ain't worried.
---
Draconis Mons and the HoT maps are by far my favourites. Thunderhead Peaks is really fun too IMO. I like the raid maps and deepstone too. Most core, PoF and other LS4 maps however are quite boring to me.
---
Eventually all MMOs will be closed. That being said, Gw2  will kick around for a while yet. 
---
Will there be more expansions? I doubt it. But will the servers stay on for a while longer? Yes, if Gw1 is anything to go by. Even now you can hop onto Guild wars 1 and play.
---
To quote Yoda: "train yourself to let go of that which you fear to lose".?
---
why would they do that? gw2 has one of the best festival in any mmo out there, because they take time and resssources to improve them. if theyd make those special things available through the entire year, whats the point of festivals then tho
---
Wildstar was LITERALLY dead, basically no player base left, completely dead. This game is still very active, gets updated regularly and flourishes. What a stupid question.
---
I swear GW2 fanboys act like repeating dungeons, dailies, and events over and over for rewards isn’t something people do in GW2.
---
gw2 is steady state with very little growth; but shutdown tomorrow, nah....
---
Avoid doing what Activision-Blizzard and EA are doing. Problem solved!
---
&gt;Downvoted for stating my opinion, further proving my point. I am done with this garbage subreddit. No wonder Anet is not doing AMAs here anymore
---
"Toxic community" is just your own projection, isn't it?
---
well thats is what gw2 is about, and (hopefully) will ever be
---
No, the game is not going anywhere. GW2 is in the top 4 of the most popular MMOs in the western world. Arguably top 2. The only thing that would kill GW2 at this rate would be the release of GW3. 
---
I like complicated zones like Tangled Depths, Draconis Mons, Desert Highlands. I love getting lost and figuring out how to navigate them. Desert Highlands for variety of biomes in single map. Honorable mention to Jahai Bluffs, my favourite so far from season 4. I absolutely despise Domain of Kourna, worst map ever - empty, boring, ugly.
---
For HoT content, there’s sometimes a couple of all day trains on the weekends that cover all the non-meta event content. This can help with the difficulty spike. 
---
It's more about taking the small steps.  Implementing something very easy that barely has any affect on the game sounds like a good feature to start with.  
---
I was hoping to be pointed in the direction to build these features for them.
---
I left gw2 for wow simply because wow offers more content.
---
I love gw2 and its always going to have a special place in my heart ,but it updates so slowly.  I just want more of gw2, more dungeons and the mythic plus dungeon system from wow.
---
mythic dungeons make wow so much more fun
---
Automated queues for PvE are absolutely horrible IMO. Terribly long queue times as DPS players, clueless players mixed with people who want fast clears, constant group disbanding even with penalties, a lot of leeching, etc. 
---
I've had nothing but bad experiences with an automated party finding system in other MMOs in any type of content that's not completely faceroll.
---
Out of curiosity, where do you go for a grouped link of the pact supplies at their current location? I want to start buying the mapping material daily and I've seen people link all 5 wp in chat in a nice cluster, but wasn't sure where you get them from.
---
The very size of the game, to begin with - 5GB vs 40GB. Also, gw1 has no open world. Everything is instanced. Not many players left, so less server stress. GW1 devs said some time ago that game is laughably cheap to maintain. GW2 on the other hand... just look how much work it costs them to implement sitting on chairs. They had to MANUALLY place every single one. It's ridiculous how unefficient gw2 is to run for them.
---
I play pretty much everything. I call this guy my main because of the amount of time I've spent on this char is about 1/3 of my total game time since 2012. 
---
Also what character I play is dependent on what mode im in.
---
PVE/LS: Thief, Guard, Necro, Warrior
---
PVP: Mesmer, Thief, Guard, Warrior, Necro
---
Fractals: Thief, Guard, Necro
---
WvW: Necro, Mesmer, Thief, Guard.
---
Thief is my most played and used on all modes with my Guardian running a close second :).
---
&gt; Am I a communist if I think game developers should organize in a union to push back against being overworked and underpaid and other problems in the industry? Just asking...
---
Not at all, just sounds to me like you have sympathy for others and only want to right the wrongs of the people who you feel were victimised. Nothing wrong with what you said, I understand how you feel.
---
This. I find it so incredibly unnecessary that you have to purchase a kit to change your hair. 
---
&gt; GW2 is in the top 4 of the most popular MMOs in the western world
---
GW2 can be even top 1 or top 100000, depending on who you ask. There are no official numbers of game population and on twitch gw2 is mostly non existing.
---
why would they have anyone extend them?, you clearly didn't read the post.
---
A blow... pipe.
---
This was on the EU servers. No idea what the top two times are, either they used a bunch of mesmers or they're absolutely insane on the griffon.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pact_Supply_Network_Agent
---
GW2 15-25 times more profitable than WS at the end. 
---
Impressive!
---
15 shared slots for useful things
---
3 invis bags for all kinds of consumables and food and swap gear (still from my dungeon days)
---
5 random 20 slot ones
---
1 craftsman and 1 oiled in the bottom where shit goes when I salvage.
---
In game? 
---
- black lion keys
---
- unlimited mining/logging/harvesting tools
---
- expansions/living world if they dont have it.
---
What i was saying is that deadeye is quite unprofitable, so i was asking why you main that spec 
---
Nothing is easy to implement in this game.
---
Anet team to gaze upon masterpiece created years ago and copy a bit of it's content. It's called Guild Wars. 
---
&gt; people **new** to fractals through T4s painfully difficult. **Newbies learning mechanics**
---
Tier 4 isn't the place for new players to get their introduction to fractals or to learn mechanics, regardless of the instabilities -- you could remove all instabilities entirely and that would still be true. That's explicitly why the tier system in Fractals exists. 
---
I’d expect to see this on Ashes of Creation over gw2 tbh
---
Guild Wars 1 is still around, i doubt gw2 will shut down any time soon (if ever).
---
I did this a bunch until I found out that there was an option in the settings menu to move Compact to the bottom of the inventory drop down.
---
**Skill effect transparency sliders.** One for yourself, a 2nd for party members/allies/teammates/friendly NPCs, and a 3rd for enemies.
---
A fresh set of dungeons and raids that have difficulty levels with each expansion. Not 0 at launch and 1 added every year.
---
Yeah, for those that want high value out of their Wardrobe Unlocks, doing dungeons is important now.
---
Progression groups (which I would still consider new to fractals) having to "regress" a tier because of artificial difficulty is frustrating for them- which is what prompted my complaint, lol. Especially since it's not really skill-based. 
---
Maybe you'd be happier if I was very specific in my complaint instead of generalizing based on several other experiences? Which I would understand. 
---
But tbh I learned in T4s, as did others I know (it's easier to find pug groups, what can I say?), so maybe my view on fractals is not the common one. 
---
Very true. But inventory management is another separate but related system - and one that is better than most other MMOs too. After enough combat OR crafting, you'll have to contend with it just from the sheer amount of loot that drops or stuff you make. FF14 has the equivalent of a bag slot per equipment slot, but no mat storage system whatsoever and inventory spaces you cannot upgrade, unless you buy extra retainers to use their inventory (and you can only access them in major cities at the bell locations). ESO has mat storage... if you sub... and only has space for so many different types (I think it is expandable though, not sure as I only tried it out).
---
Regardless, I agree that crafting can be made more engaging, but I disagree that vendor trading is a more engaging method.
---
I like the implementation of the lockpicking minigame in ESO. Adding something like that for a chance of slightly better loot in chests would be cool, while giving the option to "crack open" a chest for those who just want to open it the traditional way, without any loot bonus.
---
r/restofthefuckingowl/
---
Thread removed: This sub is not LFG.
---
Contrary to what most players seem to think, simply running an mmo with a skeleton staff for bugfixes doesnt cost much - openworld or not. It never was expensive. The expensive part is developers for new content. So if you want to keep getting new content - go spend some money on the gemshop.
---
Keep? Thieves already have bomb/cluster bomb arrow on shortbow and a variety of pistol and rifle abilities that are quite noisy. 
---
Oh boy.
---
* Build templates from GW1.
---
* Mythic+ system or some meaningful dungeon content from WoW (arguably fractals but they're trash by comparison)
---
* Actual action combat from TERA -- this means lack of targeting system, visual clarity, tactile combat
---
* GvG system from GW1
---
* Fishing. From literally every other MMO.
---
* Crafting system from XIV. The minigame is dope and every crafting system should just rip it off from now until forever.
---
There's a lot of builds that aren't "fast" but I'm curious.  I raid with a few people who are well over 50 and some in their 60s who play classes and rotations that require fast button presses to nail the rotations.  They don't do omega top tier DPS but they are far and away better than most players in their teens or 20s.  One of the people I raid with even has arthritis.  I'm just wondering if this limitation is in your head or if you have a condition that prevents you from playing some of the other classes/builds.
---
That doesn't mean it's expensive if they leave it in maintenance mode, it would be expensive to run. You know, kinda like GW1.
---
When my friend needed a new psu he was running gw2 without a GPU. It looked like an early game cube game but it ran. Might have issues with ram. Try using 32 client 
---
I usually play with my sound off or very low.  It was only two days ago I realized mesmers says this when I had my sound up.
---
&gt; LFG matching type tool
---
I agree, or at least, I think an overhaul of LFG is in order.
---
The current version is functional, but only just. I think a version which functions more like a server browser, with more options, would be very useful.
---
I know the typical response to this always seems to be "if it's too filtered, the LFG will seem empty all the time" but then that's just what happens. It makes sense.
---
They could also add tools to combat this - such as a "I will do anything that is suitable for my level" flag, so you could LFG and just get put into a group for a random dungeon or fractal, and allow players advertising groups to choose whether to accept these people. People doing PUG dungeon runs wouldn't mind, as at this stage you'll kinda accept everyone.
---
Add to that a one-time, 2hr cooldown "teleport to group leader" and you're golden.
---
??? None of this is new to the episode ...
---
Thanks for the inquiry.  The limitation is children who keep me from playing the game enough to learn the muscle memory to do well.  I may go a week without getting into the game and by then, I've forgotten the loop.  I could just keep at it, but if I can find a middle ground, its going to help me enjoy the game better.  
---
A better engine so the game doesn't look so bad. It hasn't aged very well. It's hard to look at for me.
---
GuildWars 3 is going to be a mobile phone game next :-(
---
37% to 63% is very reasonable if you foolishly compared a normal hit's damage to a critical hit's damage although it is actually 75% vs 37%
---
Shareholders are pissed that they didn't increase profits as much as they wanted. Company responds and fires people to lower "costs" and please shareholders.
---
Except the game is unsastainable like gw1, where group events don't have enough people to complete. And open world is huge problem to leave it "just like gw1"
---
 * Owl Shrine
---
 * Witch captures some local kids and you have to save them/mini-dungeon, Hero Point and portal in the back leads right back out to the mouth of the cave
---
 * Jumping Puzzle/mini-dungeon where you have to face off against local bandits while exploring a cave that the Priory has interest in, chest in the back
---
 * One of the Beetle Races
---
Private servers and paying subscription with in game currency are a thing there. I wouldn't call it an outdated game tho, but I don't support this new Blizzard at all.
---
Define "a few hits". What attacks? How many? How much time did it take? Did any of them crit? Did they get/give each other boons?
---
&gt; So if you want to keep getting new content - go spend some money on the gemshop.
---
erm no, anet sold me the game with the premise of receiving new content for free + paid expansions; this is b2p game so if money is the problem its only anet's fault for choosing insufficient business model
---
however.. the game earns enough money, problem is their efficiency and their counterproductive, mediaval tools they have to create content
---
Texas?
---
5 GB vs 40 GB is a silly comparison.
---
The fact that GW1 only needs as many instances as necessary and no more is a slight advantage but if GW2's population shrinks enough they could simply run more instances per VM. 
---
Hey, nice tool, any chance you could add a feature to auto upload Arc logs to Raidar/dps.report?
---
Episode 6: Build The Wall
---
 The sad thing is that this happens even in real life ...and too often... 
---
The plural of Charr is the singular. Multiple Charr is still Charr. Not Charrs. I must correct this whenever I see it.
---
Palaboonbeast won't kill you in seconds. It's bruiser ment to keep far node busy and it's vulnerable to high burst or stunlocks. Weaver does the same thing with evade spamming. The thing is, noobs are clueless. They actualy run circles with the slb 2-3v1 in worst scenarios on close node. 
---
Sure spend more money. All you'll get is more of their focus on Gemstore items to farm you even more and in a year or 2 last game-mode, which is PvE, drop off - just like they did with PvP and WvW.
---
New WvW horse mounts and map confirmed.
---
I don't know how you are testing, but the way you are testing it must be completely wrong. Your effective health against strike damage (**not** condis/life steal/retal) is literally just health*armor. So doubling armor is the same as doubling health. Enemy true damage is just weapon strength * Power * Skill coefficient. 
---
This is very true for Legion. However BFA being what it is 6 months in, playing GW2 casually or another MMO like ff14 is imo the best money for your enjoyment. 
---
I really wish BFA turns around in the next few month to become more like what Legion was. That way I can see myself playing it again. 
---
If GW2 had a more hardcore raid scene, and if there was some more gear scaling it could truly be a great mmo in the long run. As it is now, the leveling and story are very enjoyable but there is no real incentive for players to grind the endgame in th wow sense (as in gear oriented endgame). 
---
Fashion hunting and legendary crafting is awesome (and a lot of grind/work) but is it really that rewarding when all in all it gives you a ridiculously small  stat increase compared to Ascended gear.

Imagine if I made a video with nothing but Chrono WvW roaming and I title the video "Mesmer WvW." People who are looking for Mirage will click on it, people who are looking for core Mesmer will click on it, and it will progressively get more ridiculous as more elite specs come out in the future.
---
It's not just you, but misleading titles on YouTube videos, articles, etc waste people's time.
---
If it's a Spellbreaker montage, write Spellbreaker in the title so people who are looking for Berserker or Core Warrior gameplay don't click on and then immediately off of your video.
---
Couldn't agree more. Say what you will about the GW2 devs, they know how to make a game. And they listen to their fan base... It's just a damn good game. 
---
Just now seeing these and wow, incredible work. I would buy the griffon, skimmer and raptor without any hesitation. Hope ANet buys these designs from you!
---
Path of fire is right there about halfway down.

Posting codes publicly complicates things in ways you wouldn't normally think about. You should choose randomly or in whatever way you please, and then send the codes in private. 
---
Posting these codes public is against the rules of this subreddit. It is not recomented to post any kind of serial/ game code in public. Just send them via private message
---
Nice reply. Good ideas.
---
My bad, sorry I'll change the post. One min.
---
Not really, not in this case. The majority of that revenue comes from microtransactions and lootboxes, which require almost no investment to make.
---
Last useless thread from you?
---
Finally
---
Best regards
---
Thing is Anet aren't actually going out of their way to do anything. They aren't creating jobs for any of these people they are just pointing out they have jobs available which anyone in that field in Seattle wold find out about anyway.
---
Tbf in regards to that, Twitch numbers can be a little weird too. Like take for instance ESO. I've seen it down around the same viewership with GW2. The thing is though, ESO does [Twitch Drops from time to time](https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/55607). Basically if you watch an ESO Twitch Streamer for at least 10 minutes (after linking your ESO account with Twitch), you  have a chance to get an Ouroboros Crown Crate. The longer you watch for, the better chance you have to get that Crate. So you'll get people just sitting there with ESO Twitch channels open, boosting the numbers and helping the scene, get more reoccurring views than you would normally from the nature of the game itself. Not to say that Twitch isn't a good indicator on popularity, just that it isn't necessarily the best indicator for all cases.
---
I prefer to handle that stuff in metadata. I put spellbreaker there. I've always called SpB's warriors, so I doubt that will change.
---
As I said, I understand your frustr8ion, though.
---
They are new-ish. Basically it scores every 2 hours, and there are 5 minute ticks that all of the camps/towers/keeps give score for the skirmish. Also on each tick you get points based on how your server is ranked for the skirmish. There is both the standard reward track you had way back then and also a skirmish reward track that gives some special currency for unique skins and legendary gear.
---
It won't, and even though Anet tried to generate some hype in Q4, there wasn't a new major content release to entice more players to buy the game, resulting in poor sales according to Ncsoft's earnings report.
---
Now i don't know if the sales report factors in gem sales, but if it does then  I'm sure the outlook would be better.
---
That said, sales will bounce back up as we hear of more "expansion-like" new features in LS5 and the upcoming new expansion for sure.
---
You do a good job. A few tips:
---
-Your bread and butter kill combo is Arcing Slice -&gt; FC -&gt; Arcing Slice. FC refreshes your other Burst Skill and you can chain them together. You can also use this to double Breach as necessary, say against a Boonbeast. 
---
-Your should save your Whirlwind for an offensive dodge, not as a tool for closing distance. This is one of your biggest sources of burst damage. 
---
-If you land a stun and anticipate a stunbreak, immediately use Bull's Charge to secure a knockdown. 
---
-You can bait out an easy dodge with Dagger 2 to allow you to reliably land a Breaching Strike. 
---
-Despite being a charge, Shield 4 is the shortest range stun in the game against a moving target due to its animation. You actually need to be in their hitbox usually.
---
-Dagger 3 -&gt; Shield 4 -&gt; Bull's Charge can secure you a knockdown against most classes. 
---
-FC is an aoe daze, and can give you a lot of breathing room to use Mending in the middle of a team fight.
---
-If you start your Rampage with a rock toss, you get physical damage boost for the big aoe leap  and can fit two of them within your Rampage window. They are fantastic for Mesmers and Thieves, as they will track them through Stealth and teleports.

I was going to respond with a snarky "Cry me a river", but I actually stumbled upon a veritable river of words.

It took me like 5 meteor shower channelings worth time to get to the bottom of that by scrolling with the mousewheel.

Thanks, Koro. A lot of that is good to have in writing for newer warriors. I think the biggest thing I'm going to work on from what you said is the whirlwind as an offensive dodge, as well as starting rampage with a rock toss. That's great stuff. 
---
Thanks a ton for watching and taking the time to comment here. Appreciate it more than you know!

That is very generous of you. Thank you for the giveaway. I'd love to play GW1 so I'd be happy with either Eye of the North or Nightfall.

Starting your journey to take down the Elder Dragons, huh?

We have plenty of experienced historians there that can guide you on your first steps.
---
You just got this put on the radar to get axed in the very near future. Any time someone posts a record kill like this Anet guts the skill(s) that allow it, claiming it was/they were “unintended effects”. Enjoy it while you can.
---
It's already being worked on and it's probably mobile.

Then wouldn't it be disappointing to get one from a wardrobe unlock, instead of something else you've been covetting? ;)

Is it fun to play solo? I'm taking a break from WoW - didn't enjoy BfA and the layoffs just annoy me a bit. Googled "Best MMOs" because I seriously know that little about others, and the descriptions of Guild Wars 2 appealed to me most. Download is almost playable. :D 
---
Nice.
---
Hello, I would gladly take the Nightfall Key.
---
Thank you very much, that's really generous of you.
---
I don't think you were justly banned but this is far too much to read. Could you summarize it?
---
I know the song, point is it’s irrelevant as a meme here. The person you replied to mentioned “Rains of Ascalon”, referring to Blizzard’s bloodbath of firing, and referencing how the song “Rains of Castamere” is about a bloodbath in GoT. “Africa” is not about a bloodbath, there’s nothing in that song relevant to mass layoffs.
---
after the next LS season i wouldnt expect any new things in gw2. 
---
Cause NA dP hasn't uploaded their kill yet :P
---
None of its logical. It's gibberish rhetoric used in lieu of actual relevant reasoning to GW2 and Mordremoth. Why are you even here in the subreddit anymore? None of what you are saying relates to the game in any capacity. Go elsewhere if you just want to argue for its own sake. 
---
Guild Wars 2: Heroic Edition would be cool, but any other too. Thanks!
---
Context: I'm also old and I have a lot of muscle/hand issues that prevent me from playing more complicated rotations/professions.
---
I wouldn't bring her to t3/t4 fractals and raids but I played through all story and map complete content with a power greatsword mesmer/chronomancer. I really like the options that mesmers can provide which adds a layer of complexity, but the skill floor is also pretty low in that you don't need to use them if you don't want to. Like if you play ele and don't swap attunements you're gonna have a bad time, but for not-raid level content as a solo mesmer you could just, like, press F1 whenever you feel like it and it'll be fine.
---
If you do want raid viable builds I'd recommend power holo and condi shortbow soulbeast. I've gotten decent DPS out of them (not top tier, but rarely lowest dps in groups).
---
Oh one more thing: I think a lot of builds maximize for damage and not survivability. Wearing all assassins/vipers/berzerkers is great for dps but not if your hand is cramping and can't dodge in time, so just by swapping out gear to mauralders or knights would give any build more survivability.
---
These new instabilities idd makes these fractals less fun to do and it makes them really anoying. Also these birds eats my main thief for breakfast :/
---
1. Build Templates 
---
2. Improve WvW
---
3. Improve WvW rewards
---
4. Balance classes for competitive game modes.
---
5. More PvE maps.
---
6. Casual player raids (like snowmen)
---
I'd love a Heroic Edition code!
---
Needs a tl;dr bady
---
One of the GW2 codes would be great. Thanks :)
---
i'd love the heroic edition&lt;3 
---
I have 7200 hours in gw2.  I played since beta and it was the only game I played for years.    I even met my best friend through that game and still talk to guildmates that quit.
---
After HoW, which I loved btw, I quit because updates were too slow.  I bought the last expansion, cleared all the living story and the expansion in like 6 hours and havent logged on since.
---
ill buy the next expansion, and do the same, but to play the game daily I just cant anymore because I have 16 legendaries and cant grind anything else.
---
Now I go between Destiny 2 and wow.  wow because I love the lore and the world, and destiny  because I love the gameplay.  Neither is perfect but they compliment eachother.
---
I will quit both if anthem lives up to the hype though
---
Alive game Pog
---
Thank you for the giveaway! I'd like а GW2 Heroic Edition code.
---
Companies grow big and have a lot of money and realise they’re paying a lot of people to do either nothing or they end up doing jobs lesser qualified people are already doing for less money. It literally happens all the time. A lot of companies will just put them in a different role though.
---
The heroic edition would be pretty neat to give to a friend so they wouldn't need to be bothered by the f2p limitations.
---
I think it is more about the fact that he keeps claiming it in basically every single thread and yet he never supply any actual proof that they are working on a new game. Which could be seen as trying to create drama or spread fake news, and thus (for once) reddit is actually using the down-voting as it should be used. 
---
&gt;It's already being worked on
---
Source?
---
You could also look into in a different class. I have an 80 necro I never tough because I find it too boring to play. You rarely need to dodge and if you make a mistake death shroud is there to save the day. On the other hand I love my ele (Weaver) I feel very engaged when fighting. I can survive better on my ele due to healing and shields but I need to be paying attention to do it.

---
I have one question, how do you play 6 chars at once? 
---
Not the figurative how, but literally. Do you just spam tab and hold w? Do they all follow your single mouse cursor? Do you tab through them and perform single actions?
---
Like in silver wastes for example.
---
I assume A is just a normal healthy brain
---
You are getting downvoted because any hint of discussion is met with "hurr durr circlejerking Reddit at it again".
---
I had one like that once. Amazing insurances from day 1 of hire, all office visits were $10 co-pay + 100% prescription coverage, corporate trips w/guest included free like Las Vegas on 2 chartered 747's, a Disney World vacay, and an entire Princess Cruise Liner rented just for the company (where the CEO/Pres was made honorary captain and performed 2 weddings)...
---
Then I stumbled across some mysterious bookkeeping and wandered down the rabbit hole ending up with the company cooking the books, shafting investors out of literally billions and the VP spending 3 years in Club Fed on a plea deal.

---
You are correct in that assessment, I am sick of "discussing" things with the cryhard carebears on this sub. No one is willing to listen so why should I even bother at this point?
---
cheers man, i shouldve quit when i got it tbh, i told myself to quit like 3 years ago if i ever got it but i continued to play. 
---
I understand if u think that, but i honestly wouldnt come back even if they ubanned me. Its obvious to me after this that they dont have ways to detect whether people use 3rd party tools or not.
---
This means i wont be able to multibox again without the efar of getting suspended again for simply playing. This one was 6 months, whats next, 1 year? na, they are not worth my time anymore and i can finally justify quitting this game. 
---
I'm gon send in my support ticket for my only account not suspended tomorrow to have it terminated, just gotta send all materials over to my buddy frist.
---
... So when will you be submitting this script for Hollywood to produce?

This is still a privately-owned company, that has the right to make and enforce its own rules, as it sees fit. Bringing your case into social media is rarely ever going to get any different result than you already have. Writing a manifesto even less so.
---
You've engaged in a VERY very niche method of using the software the way you want, which was never intended by the owner of the software and has almost nothing to do with the other 99.8% of us. In fact, I bet it's been a bit of a headache for someone at ArenaNet when they could have been working on something else. Sorry you had a bad experience, hope you learn to live through it. This is extremely dramatic and unhealthy behavior.
---
Something I learned today: NCSoft is a 25% owner of Anet. Their earnings for GW2 are tied to expansion releases and NOT to in game gemstore purchases. For an intents and purposes, Anet may be doing just fine financially. All the report shows is that the sale of expansion copies is down. I think it's more likely that we see another expansion before GW3 (but that is pure speculation on my part)
---
You should read it when you have time, if you multibox or just plays the game i think you should read it.
---
I wouldn't say no to a Guild Wars 2: Toy Mini Eye DLC

Bank tabs are horribly inefficient. Better to buy a character slot and throw cheapo 15 slot bags on it than to buy a bank tab

---
Exactly. Like, it changes everything.
---
isnt the purpose of instability to make the fractals harder and giving it a different feel? i honestly like the new instabilities. Took time to get use to slippery slope but one you get it down you can stop where you want no problem.
---
Pretty sure those reasons aren’t enough to justify risking discarding GW2 attempting to get the player base to move to GW3. #1 and #2 are kind of nit picky, and #3 is more speculation. Unless you were a developer at ANet, nobody really knows why LS1 can’t be added back to GW2, and the odds it would be included into a sequel are even lower.
---
The thing is that people would still just ignore it anyway, because it wouldn't fit their narrative about how the game is dying. 
---
People
---
This is not correct. NCSOFT quarterly earnings reports are total revenue, not simply box sales
---
Pretty sure I didn't peddle this as fact but go off I guess.
---
Chrono is specialization of a Mesmer. Spellbreaker is a specialization of Warrior.
---
More importantly, SpB does not alter how a Warrior is played in a significant fashion, unlike a Chrono or Mirage, so it's an awful comparison. 
---
Then again, if you are genuinely looking for core warrior gameplay videos in sPvP, you probably have very little knowledge of core warrior or sPvP.
---
Power Dragonhunter is also a low-entry class you may enjoy. 
---
That's odd, here we rarely talk about other subs https://i.pinimg.com/originals/99/e8/ef/99e8efccc0b5ed36f9ecc0249e58b2a3.jpg
---
But would NCSoft actually earn 100% of ArenaNets income despite only owning 25%?  
---
It is a genuine question since I don't actually know how all those things work, but it does seem incredibly silly. 
---
I saw you link your etsy in one of the other comments and shared it in a gardening oriented discord im in. Please just read my comments of "oh hell i want ALL OF THESE" but with a good couple dozen other plant nerds chiming in with the same, laughs. A universal hit. 
---
A healing potion. For PVE only. 
---
I never realized how useful it was having a 5% of your health back healing potion at cap in other MMOs until I started playing Guild wars 2 and it was gone. That emergency heal when all your healing skills were on cooldown was lifesaving at times. 
---
I would love to have a  gold sink healing potion for an emergency sip of healing even it was only 1% of your health back. A nice emergency for when Tendril Roots or Veteran Bristelbacks deplete your evades and heals but are still aimbot ranging you to death.   
---
that is me :P
---
The heroics edition would be pretty cool, thanks.
---
And how do we know you weren't terrible? For all we know, you did less dps than the druid as a DE.
---
Okay, I read it in its entirety. I like that your argument is constructive, but it would be more convincing if you kept the details to a minimum and simply claimed to be banned for third-party programs without ever using third-party programs.
---
This always happens to me in big fights like The Shatterer. Fighting away at it and then suddenly I am targeting some random thing or an ally.
---
Your experience sounds very skewed, but for an organized group they were probably hoping/expecting better.
---
Maybe while you practiced it your rotation or gear put you significantly below somewhere where they wanted you to be, or where others expected. Like if you got outdps'd by the support chronos?
---
Would suggest joining a training discord!
---
Turn auto target off.
---
If the skill itself seeks random enemies then stand in the champ's hitbox.

---
There are assholes everywhere; you shouldn't let a toxic experience deter you from doing the content that you like. A toxic raider is no different from a salty PvPer. Block them and move on, and have pity for them because their life is sad enough that they can only feel "superior" by shitting on other players instead of giving you helpful and constructive advise.
---
LFG has its assholes. I'd suggest joining a raid training guild or Discord while you learn, and I'd pretty much wholeheartedly advise against using LFG to get your weeklies because most pugs are terrible on top of being toxic and it just isn't worth the hassle.
---
&gt;Why do people bother saying stuff like this -_-.
---
Search and Rescue is a niche skill that only got more irrelevant with the rise of support Scourge. I personally wouldn't bring SnR anywhere because if you need that utility, you're better off getting a Scourge as a second healer. That being said, you shouldn't be harassed simply because you were trying to help the group. I'm sorry that happened to you.
---
So I guess you're a male that likes to make pretend being a girl in his spare time while dressing up.
---
Summarizes a lot.
---
Get arcdps and it might help you understand their behavior next time it happens. Honestly, there's no excuses to perform poorly on one of the most simple dps builds with among highest damage potential. Gorse isnt mechanic heavy boss so that couldnt be an issue for sure and I doubt that they'd be toxic for no reason (there's been cases, but those happen very rarely).
---
It's very easy to be a victim, but try considering that it might be actually your fault. Not saying that it is, but people usually have hard time believing that and always blame some other factors. The sooner you realize, the sooner you can improve and move on.

Here is my 2 cents on fractals:  Okay maybe my wall of text is more like 20 dollars on this topic.  
---
What separates GW2 “small group content” from other MMOs is that there is no restrictions on party roles.  It is entirely possibly to end up in a group where everyone is a specialised DPS or everyone is a specialised Support.  Fractal runs where everyone is the “same party role” tend to be the most difficult runs.
---
The easiest fractal runs that I have personally participated in tend to be the ones where there is lots utility such as condition removal and CC.  People normally don’t equip these types of skills in order to maximise their DPS.  For example, the volcano boss tends to be a difficult boss fight, even at T1, because the boss area continuously stacks burning on the party.  This generally results in a situation where 1 or 2 people have to fight the boss solo because everyone else died from the continuous condition damage.  Whenever I have fought this boss where the party has lots of AoE condition removal, the boss becomes the easiest boss fight in GW2.  
---
This is the reason why I’ve built my character around fulfilling multiple party roles.  My character is able to provide both DPS and utility (and it works really well!).  It took a lot of trial and error to build my character.  A lot of the skills that “looked good on paper” and were recommended on the internet didn’t necessarily perform when grouped with a random Fractal PUG.  The key to having a good build that performs well are skills and traits that synergise really well.  Raw stats will only get you so far and it is through synergy that will get you excellent results. 
---
If you are looking at a boon support build, the important thing to remember is that there are other boons besides Might.  The maximum amount of Might you can stack is 25.  There are loads of builds that can stack 25 Might on a party solo.  If more than one Might stacking player joins the group, the second Might stacking player is not as useful.  Fury, Swiftness, Quickness and Protection are all excellent boons that are of great use to a party.  
---
Last but not least, there are a lot of jumping puzzles in Fractals.  Having a skill that increases movement speed will make these much easier.  You don’t necessarily need the movement skill equipped 24/7.  I generally swap to a movement skill temporarily and swap back to my regular skill once the jumping puzzle has been beaten.  
---
Honestly even though this might be true, you don’t need to relay that info like an ass.  You could just as easily give pointers and tips to help them get better.
---
I’m not surprised the guild has to look for pugs if that’s how they treat everyone.  That type of behavior hurts the game, not make it better.
---
Hoping i wasn't too late, anything would be appreciated. Good luck for everyone :&gt;
---
I am in the EU server.
---
&gt; You should read it when you have time
---
we all kinda busy playing gw2
---
&gt;This is still a privately-owned company, that has the right to make and enforce its own rules, as it sees fit.
---
That's not what it's doing though is it? What rules has he broken? Even Anet can't tell him and just fobbed him off with 'you said naughty words a couple years ago'. Rules should be enforced evenly if a company wants to retain a good image. Whether his use of the software was niche or not doesn't matter, if it's not against their ToS he shouldn't be banned. Whether many other people use it in that fashion doesn't matter either, it's not a majority vote.
---
Meanwhile we got people botting, multiboxing, wintrading and smurfing in sPvP and absolutely nothing is done about it. For those idling or harassing people, reporting is just placebo. 
---
We dont know the whole story though. For what we know OP could've  faked LI when they joined the squad.
---
Okay update...
---
I admit the title of this thread is very brash. I just was heated when making the thread. I'll still raid I guess but it's such a deterent when people act like this towards you, and you have to stay in the raid or you won't get the loot... 
---
I'll try to find a guild. Started raiding 3 weeks ago and it's great, but something like this happened 4 times already. None of them as worse as this specific case.
---
Once again that’s not the issue.  Maybe he wasn’t ready, maybe his dps wasn’t good, but as a guild to treat someone this way is terrible.  Just remove him from the group and give the info you just did.  Maybe give him some pointers to help him.  Don’t talk shit and tell him to uninstall the game. 
---
You want to try fractals? Do you play on NA or EU? I can help with getting you into them if you want
---
I'm never playing open world again.
---
I'll make this quick.
---
I was in a squad doing worldbosses. Played my bearbow because that's my main DPS class and practiced hitting 1 for a while.
---
When we started fighting Tequatl mapchat was yelling that there was not enough damage and that too many people were just hitting 1 and lying dead. They called everyone dumb and other mean things. The squad disbanded soon after that.
---
People in open world are so toxic! Almost every time I try to do a worldboss there are people in chat that do this. Why do people bother saying stuff like this -_-
---
You're not wrong about my tone, but I can't really give tips and pointers when I have no information about what actually happened to OP. 
---
Also, we don't know what lfg OP joined either, so it may have been more than just "exp".
---
Yes definitely it’s friendly. It doesn’t always do a good job of explaining itself and its systems but that’s what the community is for!
---
Aw thanks. I'm in NA (pacific coast time). I am in a guild that runs them daily, and they've invited me along before. I should really just go with them, but I am hesitant. I think I'm still working on my comfort level with the guild, but they seem like a chill bunch.
---
I played on 2 monitors with 3 clients on each, i drag my mouse between the monitors and clients. I have several videos in my post if u want to see.
---
I use autorun when i move, your char doesnt stop moving if u switch clients, if i wanted to change direction i would change direction with my mouse.
---
I used autocast on most encounters, and tried to use my shade skills whenever possible.
---
For silverwastes i would use 2 mesmers and that mesmer skill mimic or whatever, so if i cast mimic then used portal i would have a second portal ready without waiting for cooldown. So 4 portals.

Hahaha. I spent most of my WoW gold on transmog. I need to be beautiful in game. :D I am a dude tho, yeah!
---
I love seeing research like this!
---
I'd like to see max run speeds for each profession, too, but that would take more research to find what the optimal running rotation is. I know the actual out-of-combat run speed cap is 33% faster, but I wonder how much teleports (like blink/jaunt) can make you 'run faster' (average speed rather than instantaneous) than that, and what the actual max average speed is for each profession (over a long period of time). 
---
it-shirt funny how they invented the deepest most intricate most revolutionizing most enjoyable skill system in gaming history.
---
and then completely abandon every trace of it. even the small quality of life improvement that could be employed to the new and current shadow of its iteration. such as templates.
---
I would love some of the GW1 Codes, I never played it and would like to try GW1 a bit. Thank you for the giveaway :)

I mean if someone is not responding for that long most would assume either AFK or DC.

Looks like the legs are crossed

Seems to be limiting themselves in terms of designing it
---
(Noob talking)
---
IMO Revenant was a bad pick in that regard. I think anything but Mesmer and Elementalist (and Revenant) is a decent pick. And maybe avoid Thief.
---
I'm currently maining a Sentinel's/Soldier's (But may switch to Marauder) (tl;dr Power) Reaper with a focus on Shroud. So far it melts everything and it has a pretty 'easy' rotation without feeling too mindless. And you can still have all your skills on minions if you want, or put them on life-force generating skills for more Shroud popping.

Well I’ve been using the griffin all wrong

Guild Wars 2: Heroic Edition would be great!
---
Thanks so much for the chance!

IKR? It was ridiculous amounts of load times and I don't blame them, but it's nice in XIV to be able to let people know "oh sorry, I'm just loading in, I'll be there shortly!"
---
I only have the load issues with GW2 as well....
---
Gems. You can change worlds by paying gems
---
Could've gone with that as well. Or Vinewrath, or basically any meta. Always some people in mapchat complaining/blaming/doing anything but actually contributing in open world.

I wish the carnival in divinities reach would open.

The only things I want in GW2 are Rare Spawns and Fishing. I'v eplayed MMOs for a long time and a lot of enjoyment I get is from chasing rare spawns. The other would be fishing. Its very easy to add a engaging and fleshed out fishing system that players could do in their spare/down time.

Would your guild talk shit on the pug and tell him to uninstall the game or just kick him?
---
The problem isn’t getting kicked, it’s the toxic atmosphere that guild that kicked him created. 
---
Unfortunately, not everyone perceives underperformance this way.
---
We are missing a couple key facts-&gt; 1. What was the LFG advertised for (how experienced, what they were looking for); 2. How did OP claim when he joined (if they were looking for experienced dps, did he say he was?); 3. How did OP respond if he was confronted about his dps in the first place? If he responded negatively, he would get a negative respond as such. Some people can be very negative to feedback. 
---
The common factor for cases like these lies with where people start out raiding. The community ( being good or being toxic) is always going to be a variable since you don't know what kind of group you're going into when you PUG.
