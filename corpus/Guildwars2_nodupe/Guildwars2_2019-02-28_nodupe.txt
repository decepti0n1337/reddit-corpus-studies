Markets can only grow so much. Tossing their access to an entire market doesn't make sense.

---
To everyone who thinks the game will die soon: The game will die. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not this year. Not next year. But at one point the servers will go down. Why do you waste so much time thinking about the future of the game instead of just enjoying the game? Holy shit....
---
I almost only play PvP games and never have that problem, playing ARK PvE right now with a friend and we are having great fun, people also put thousands of hours doing the same PvE in that game without getting bored so?
---

---
Why can't the actual gameplay in MMO's not be fun enough to be worth playing it for just that unlike other games?
---
... you mean Switzerland?
---
People of Sweden are called Swedes.
---
Not probably, 100% means Swiss style tournaments.
---
Just a stab in the dark, but maybe one of the unannounced titles already had a Game Director. 
---
Oh that is awesome.
---
&gt; It's the sense of progression.
---
Emphasis on sense, because it is an artifical grind that doesn't change anything relatively.
---
But if feels like you do, and honestly that’s enough for many.  Modern mmos tend not to have make it a grind unless you want to grind out the absolute strongest gear, as well.  For FF14 and WoW for example gear that is good for all but the most difficult raids are pretty much thrown at you.
---
So you've been playing Age of Empires 2 since 1998?
---
This response is everything I hate about this community. Thanks for that.
---
Of course they're going to leave, they're going to get a huge payout, they were at the company for 15+ years.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Maybe NCSoft could have helped them out a bit, given their huge profits in mobile in Korea. Maybe they just don't give a shit and it's too much effort.
---
I agree very much that Anet has been top-notch in keeping every expansion very distinct in how you approach each expansion-content instead of just piling on more of the same. This is why their decision to add another LW season after the current is very disappointing to me. As a long-time player of FF14 and its strict vertical progression and instanced content GW2 is a fresh breeze, especially with how rewarding exploration is. I do not know what more Anet could add but tbh I wouldn't have thought of the mount-system they implemented either so I refuse to believe there is nothing more that can be done. 
---
However, irregardless of GW2 Anet needs something on the horizon that can pick up the torch after it starts to die off and given that dev-time for MMO's can stretch for 3-4 years it doesn't look good. I think both Anet and NCsoft knows that.
---
Are these kind of titles made up before the position is filled or do they "grow" with the person every time their main work responsibilities shift either due to relocation or promotion?
---
And is Mike Z the only Game Director left now?
---
I just hope we eventually get to go back to cantha. I miss the jade sea.
---
&gt; But if feels like you do, and honestly that’s enough for many.
---
It doesn't?
---
&gt;For FF14 and WoW for example gear that is good for all but the most difficult raids are pretty much thrown at you.
---
Don't make me laugh, my WoW experience:
---
PvE warlock: "throws dots while i am on a mount" Me: "dies".
---
PvP person that got raid trinkets "Oneshots me for no reason" Me: "dies"
---
Imagine if you had to grind raids to be able to WvW, i wouldn't play this game then.
---
Well they can't just pull a bunch of raids out of their ass overnight for the WoW crowd.
---
Yeah that's what I meant. Sorry. 
---
good point
---
&lt;3
---
No, since i was a kid kinda 2005 ish. My dad has been playing it since then though and still does, many do.
---
Ive been playing Smite since 2013, same gamemode.
---
Actually they told us what we already know. 
---
I mean, you are talking about pvp which is a whole different animal.  That isn’t an issue with gear treadmill so much as it is with the design of pvp.  In WoW you can get gear for PvP just by PvPing, though honestly I’ve always hated how gear affect PvP in WoW.  FF14 for example simply has gear do nothing on PvP (it’s pvp is still poor but that’s due to other, non gear related reasons)
---
fb since he share perma protection,stab,resist,quicness and some shit to that.
---
5 animators, 8 environment artists, 5 tools programmers. Ouch.
---
All positions that would have been hugely beneficial in shoring up some of the under-represented or under-monetized community wants. New emotes (dance books), new hairs and faces, build templates. 
---
I didn't claim they could. My point was that the fact that there isn't more raids and dungeons is probably the result of decisions made in the past when they gave-up on the game to a certain extent and directed their efforts with regards to GW2 more towards slowing down the decline of player population than gaining new players.
---
World restructuring refers to World vs World restructuring.
---
Oh, I'm sorry. Should I let you have everything first? Let everyone else have everything first? Take my chances on never getting anything for myself, or perhaps learn to live with scraps?
---
*Please.*
---
&gt;Ok so maybe this is something the fringe Swiss community has been asking for, not quite sure why they can't organise their own tournaments like the rest of us. Seems a bit specifically selfish.
---
I always love when people post diatribes about how the game is dying, and then say something so stupid it makes it abundantly clear they haven't even bothered to actually engage brain for more than a second before hammering away on their keyboards.
---
Seriously, how could you think something so absurd as "Swiss tournament support" meaning an exclusive tournament for people of Swiss nationality, rather than thinking "hey this sounds a little odd, let me [google it](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament) first.".
---
If you think this is bad, try browsing r/artifact.
---
Whew. Wish I had time to get my new human ranger up to HoT. Next month then haha.
---
It's ArenaNet, not Gravity.
---
Not the point. The point is that I won't get to make that judgement for myself, and the guy wants the game to shift back to being *only* that.
---
I don't think many players have the patience to see if they learn, specially if they show no signs and keep the same PR policies up.
---
Yea FF14 and WoW will probably continue to be safe bets in the MMO world since neither Square or Blizzard is going anywhere anytime soon.
---
WvW roaming is 60% of what i do in this game and im still not bored, the other 40% is music lol.
---
I play as much as i play Smite really, maybe a bit less but.
---
Maybe check your keybinds in GW2? You can set these mouse buttons to do whatever you like. I have my mouse 4 &amp; 5 set to jump and dodge.
---
Mike Z made comment on forums today?Yesterday? i imagine it's not him.
---
They're talking about WvW restructuring, not restructuring of Tyrian maps.
---
Oh, yeah, nevermind then, that's totally fine. There's no problem at all with Living World 1 being completely inaccessible, because I can just get a bunch of people together and go play the encounters as Fractals!
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Words to express my frustration at how completely you are missing what's wrong with "the game will be entirely composed of one-shot disposable content that nobody can experience after that part of the story is over" just don't even exist. I guess you're one of those "I don't care about the stupid story; I'm just here for the combat" types, in which case we're never going to understand each other and there's no point in further communication.
---
I mean hey, I'm not here to tell you what not to like. 
---
I played GW2 since launch up until PoF, and as time went on the game just wasn't grabbing me as it did at launch
---
That's making money in general, tbh.
---
Ll
---
THIS - because the OP is so vague - and mode matters. Druids in terms of heals are &gt; rev and FB. BUT - their boons/spirits is the reason they are preferred in raids. NOT their heals, they just happen to heal well enough. 
---
No, they are indeed like that. I feel kind of sad for Matt having to deal with such thinly veiled rage, condescending "advice" and entitlement, just because there is apparently no better option to vent. Half of what apparently is supposed to come across as "polite" here ... doesn't really? 
---
"You are not working there anymore, so it's only /half/ directed at you." --&gt; What a gracious and kind thing to say.
---
Even a fun game gets old for some people after literally running the same thing over and over.  Ever Ark has a progression system.  People do enjoy the game, but new content is exciting, so why wouldn’t people want it?
---
Why not outsource to china like Blizzard for shitty mobile games no one wants?
---
Their "focus" on it will be the exact same amount of people working on it as they've had for a while now. No business reduces head count and proves it can continue in such a way and then keeps extra heads around when a layoff happens.
---
I don't see how I've misrepresented anything you said. I also don't understand why you're being so defensive.
---
Clearly you have very strong opinions about this subject. My mistake for sharing one that doesn't fit your world view.
---
It's not your responsibility as a potential new player to prop up the game with purchases. It's Anet's responsibility to create content that keep consumer confidence and drive revenues.
---
As an established player who's been around since launch, they've absolutely lost my confidence. I genuinely don't think the game will survive. Will it happen this year? Probably not, these things take time. But I'd be surprised if we weren't in offical maintenance mode by the end of next year, just waiting for the end.
---
I mean, it was also in the middle of the layoff announcements. So at the time it was announced, it likely was closer to 100 but became closer to 150 later on after the person who tweeted "over 100" left.
---
I don't want to be the one that pops your bubble but if Deso was a good fighting server you would not have such low k/d which are the same as Gandara and Piken this week. 
---
Reason why Deso was good for about two months was because you had the AG link. You don't have AG-Link anymore so what was is no more unless Deso become the next target for the bandwagon. 
---
The fact that Tempest isn't even included hurts my heart.
---
Healscourge xD
---
However they do LS5 I don't see how they can require people to buy the aging PoF to access it. They need to do something different with their business model to pull in the cash that can better justify more GW2 dev. Like offering at least some initial free access to LS updates so everyone can get in on the release buzz. They of course will likely need to monitize something else they haven't before but the status quo isn't really working well enough for them anymore.
---
It's pretty amusing how a veteran game developer is telling you how be effective in getting your feedback into the hands of a developer, and your response is "But developers should listen to our vitriol and cynicism regardless!"
---
You sound like you're more interested in proving one side "wrong" than you are about actually getting your ideas and feedback heard. Ultimately, you're communicating poorly and ineffectively -- if your actual goal is to influence a game developer so as to get something changed in the way you want, the best solution is not yell and fight about it but rather to change the way that you deliver your message.
---
Performance isn't capped with GW2 at all, but rumor has it anyone who actively worked on the engine between GW1 and 2 has since left. 
---
I made 2 weeks wages in 1 trade on the stock market this week, during a work meeting, in 7 minutes. 3.30 -&gt;4.15, then back down to below 3.30 within 2 minutes of my sell limit completing. It closed at 2.18, well below what I bought &amp; sold it at. 
---
Nothing about "earning" money is actually earning. &amp; being a "weasel" is just being efficient, maximizing money over time.
---
Sure, just don't convert all of your Pristines at once. Pristines funded like 80% of my potion cost and infinite pots are a major QoL improvement for fractals. 
---
I kept my Fractal tonic btw. I've been playing fractal for nearly 3 years now and I've only got the tonic drop once. That's how rare it is. 
---
This.
---
You can see their account name in the guild panel or when you mouse over their name in chat.
---
That's how money is made efficiently, finding the fastest possible rate and using it until it's gone or replaced.
---
The company is already circling the rim with this nonsense 
---
They are! I might just have to try growing some!
---
As a paying customer for their service then yeah their business plan is kinda my business. Otherwise Ill go invest my time and money elsewhere
---
What I want for WvW? I gonna tell you, so maybe you can swallow all this ridiculous attitude about being "polite" 'cos a developer who took wrong decisions was laid off.
---
I want WvW being what was promised as first time. A game mode with strategy (that actually DOESN'T have).
---
I want maps where the structures really mean something more than a stupid tower or camp lost in a map, without any reason to be than being a bunch of karma for being farmed and not cared.
---
I want a real class balance (not the joke we usually have, 'cos devs don't know the state of the game mode).
---
I want balanced populations, and not a system that players can exploit easily for overflowing three linked servers and stomping the rest of them, 'cos devs decide to link servers without critery.
---
I want the game mode to be fun again.
---
And NO, McKenna's job didn't make the game mode fun, sorry. I've critizised many times WvW Team and I've offered constructive ideas for incentiving the interest of the game mode. And we just had silence as answer, smoke as empty promises and a game mode that is emptier for moments.
---
THIS is what I want, sir. So easy like this.
---
Deal with it.
---
Its cute but it reminds me more of lickitung for some reason xP GJ though quagans are cute AF
---
The problem, for me at least, is money earned in that way doesn't come with any satisfaction. Earning money doing hard work adds a zest that makes life worth more. I THINK it was Socrates who was happy being extremely destitute but philosophically golden.
---
Oh look! The average gw2 player!
---
&gt; The only reason mystic forging is profitable is because it's annoying
---
This is the correct answer. IF you skirt around it you should be banned as you're automating it. 
---
shut the FUCK up kid
---
Can also technically select report and get the account name there if they aren't in guild or added as a friend.
---
Christmas came early this year.
---
These gyro changes look great. Very excited.
---
Scrapper goes from a very good support in WvW, to truly exceptional with these changes.
---
&gt;"As part of this rework, gyros are being reclassified as wells, and the scrapper's particular version of them is mobile and point-blank to enhance the scrapper's melee-oriented playstyle.
---
[...]
---
&gt;• Sneak Gyro: This skill has been reworked. The gyro now creates a smoke field that follows the engineer while it grants stealth to the player and nearby allies every second."
---
This is just bullshit
---
you can't argue with people here, they think businesses are run and paid by hugs and cuddles alone.
---
If you had watched the video youd know WPs source said those that quit voluntarily didnt get any special severance deal.
---
This is actually really cool, we’re getting communication! 
---
Nice to see Mirage not getting wrecked in PvE for the sake of WvW/PvP nerfs which of course were needed. 
---
As someone who is really a PvE only player I am confused as hell about *"This skill can no longer be used on targets behind the mesmer."* That was a thing?
---
Mirage cloak speed and dodge duration changed to same as a normal dodge. Yeah personally not a fan of this change at all but I don't see it being that big of an issue, hopefully. 
---
I've been her guildie for years as we're part of [PuG], and it's a sudden shock to hear of her passing.  Hearing that Melora just went like that reminds me of how you never miss what you have until it's gone.
---
I remember the days of Stormbluff Isle Tequatl server runs where we'd run them every day after the revamp, the cursing of the clocktower jumping puzzle, the wintersday year when I had to do her jumping for her because she was on a crappy loaned laptop while her PC was in for repair...
---
I'll always value the short time we had on Guild Wars 2.
---
What ends up happening in these scenarios is that the company pays out as a lump sum the 60 days (or more) in salary and benefits in exchange for a contract waiving the notice requirement. This is good for the employee because the get the same amount of money, but aren't restricted by non-compete clauses in their former contract. This is good for the company because they don't have a bunch of employees hanging around knowing they aren't going to be unemployed in 60 days sinking morale for everyone who is still there.
---
In the distant future I would love to see an expack that’s what helps the game with hype and content. For now I want to see them tackle the existing problems in the game imo.
---
Warrior even more dead now omegalul
---
Do we know what server this is being hosted on?
---
Signet of Inspiration is like the Shadow Form of Guild Wars 2. You can keep nerfing it, but it stays a staple of high-end content and players will always find new ways to break it. 
---
They would have had employees sign a contract waiving the warning requirement in exchange for the severance. If the severance was more than 60 days salary + benefits any employee would take it instead of sitting at home for two months locked into a non-compete clause for the same amount of (or less) money.
---
It's always amazing when they talk about making things better, they always make them worse.
---
The condition pressure getting nerfed on scourge is good but I'm not sure it'll pull anyone away from the class.
---
 • Signet of the Ether: This skill's recharge time now begins at the same time as phantasm skills are recharged.   
---
Can someone please confirm/annul my concerns about this change. I'm a power chrono dps main, it's basically all I play, the only fun dps class for me anymore.   
---
When you are doing your rotation, you cast signet of the ether (SOE) and during the period where your phantasms are refreshed, and the signet hasn't yet gone on cooldown, you then cast Continuum Split, then you cast your phantasms again inside of your C-Split.  
---
When you come out of C-Split, your phantasms aren't on cooldown as they reset before you went into C-Split, and your SOE isn't on cooldown either, as the skill only goes on cooldown inside of your C-Split.
---
This change seems to remove the ability to use the C-Split+SOE aftercast combination. If so, I can safely say that power chrono is essentially dead. 
---
Just because people are saying they should do that does not mean they are actively working on it like that guy said. I mean, obviously they are going to be working on an internal roadmap, but I didn't read anything here that made me think they planned to share anything with us. Maybe they will, but nothing here said anything to lead us to believe that.
---
who the fuck is this fedora wearing clown lol  
---
*mi'lady intensifies*
---
I agree with everything except for the Blast Gyro Tag.  My main in PvP is Scrapper, and that was like my only tanged skill other than hammer 5!  Sometimes you just need one little ranged thing to make a difference, and I used it really well in conjunction with hammer 5 &amp; 3.   Love all the other fields, but my goodness I'm going to miss the range.
---
Limitations on a good combined with desire to obtain said good create the value of a good. In this case, the limitations are a player's patience while tossing crap into the toilet. If suddenly, that limitation were removed, prices would drop, because the effort it takes the cheaters to get the goods is 0. Moreover, the more people realize what is going on, the more people will flood the market with easily obtained goods. You will create a profit margin so insignificant that it would be a loss to create the good compared to other uses of time. However, for the cheaters, that is not an issue, because they are able to collect returns while working, or sleeping or such, basically reducing the cost to the cost of the materials, and nothing more. The cheaters will move from good to good, flooding the market until nothing of value remains. 
---
If you actually do this, you should be banned. No question.
---
rip spirits and rip warrior. still a long way from good balance I see
---
please understand **mmorgs don't work the same way as an average game does**, announcing or releasing gw3 WILL murder not only gw2, but anet as a whole. **Of course things should "evolve" you might think, and know what? you're right.**
---
**However at which cost?** anet already pulled a game-kill move when gw2 was released, can they do the same thing again in a profiting way? **the answer is NO.**   
---
Releasing another mmorg for the sake of a new engine could have a huge backlash to arenanet's already not-so-great reputation and will spread our community even more, on a declining MMORG market on a top of that.
---
I'm all in for a huge system update, however **if they dare to announce or release gw3 before gw2 becomes at least 10 years old. It will mark the end of anet as a MMORG company,** this is no doomsday preaching, or speculation, this is a fact that has been proved with trial and error by many asian MMORG companies over the years.
---
Look at WoW, updating itself after so many years, despite their declining population due kitten decisions, still holds his own as "the top" mmorg in the western market, sadly. That's the way to go.   
---
That said... **Gw3 should never become a thing until technologies reach a point where gw2 could be considered as an "old school game" like gw1 could be said to be nowadays.**
---
I agree with everything you said, but I wish I had the energy to get angry like you, at least it would be *some* kind of emotion that isn't pathetic. I'm just sad, sometimes anguished and I can't produce a single positive thought about the future of the game. As much as my friends try to placate me with reassurances such as "we don't know the future yet", or "just wait and see, the game isn't dead", the facts SCREAM a game that yes, may not be dead yet, but could be on its fucking merry way; a game that could - again, not sure, but it's a possibility - be on the way to slowly bleed out over the course of a year/a few months, losing players and with slower and slower content output until there's nothing left. Let's face it: the game has been in a weird, unsteady, where-are-they-going-with-this place for MONTHS, if not more, and most of us noticed it, drooling fanboys included... maybe. 
---
I'm sure you'll concede that it's normal for gaming companies to work on side projects while milking their cash cow (in this case, their only game...), but still, what the fuck. We spend money on the game because we want THE FUCKING GAME, or at least updates to it, at least some fucking expansion or, yanno, something... anything that isn't an unsustainable LS with a population-shattering system and the excitement factor of a visit to the nail salon. 
---
Expansions. Generate. Hype. Expansions. Generate. Players. Raids,  High-end content. New features. Reworks. Classes. Specialisations. That's what makes people come back.
---
LS FUCKING DOESN'T! 
---
What this "communication" says: we'll barely push out what we've already been working on for a while, with delays, so you'll prooobably get more unexciting LS and some wvw updates and pray not everyone leaves... but then we got fucking nothing. 
---
*Joins in dancing with him, humming something about tiny helicopters*
---
Okay, but with this change does this mean GYROS WORK UNDERWATER NOW?!
---
Wait, what about Function Gyro?
---
Oh I definitely agree, I would love for the open world to be more challenging in ESO at level cap. Really the best open world experience you'll have is on your first character leveling up.
---
I would also say that I enjoy GW2's combat slightly more than ESO, obviously that's subjective and there are some similarities between them, but GW2 combat just feels like a perfect mix of old school MMO combat with new school. ESO on the other hand has combat locked to a crosshair, GW2's equivalent would be action camera mode.
---
Even with these shortcomings I still like ESO overall more than GW2, because I feel it does everything else better- especially content releases.
---
I haven't touched my engineer in a long time since I didn't care for the Holosmith much. This makes me want to go try some scrapper stuff again though.
---
I guess I never realized that dodge+superspeed worked while moving backwards lol. You're not usually running away from things in PvE.
---
Anet 7 days ago:  *"... ArenaNet will make staff reductions. This is part of a larger  organizational restructuring within NCSOFT in the west, but the Guild  Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is any  upcoming game content canceled."* 
---
Anet 3 days ago:  *"ArenaNet is in mourning. The studio lost many talented, amazing people today."* 
---
Anet today:   *"The studio has recently been affected by layoffs, which is going to take some time to process. There’s no easy way for any team to adjust to that...  After all is said and done, it's going to take some time for us to adjust to our staffing changes."*  
---
Soon, I'm sure.
---
Time to brush of the ol reaper. And I can’t tell if warrior is just a dead class now or better then they were before??? 
---
Thief buffs, huh? Well, its unexpected, but quite welcome. Unhindered combatant is a lot better now vs Cripple, the shadow return buff does give you a bit more flexibility, so D/P should be at least slightly better. Still incapable of 1v1ing, but thats thief. Silent Scope nerf is welcome in WvW (permastealth oneshots are dumb) but unneccessary in PvP (Deadeye is already terrible anyway), but sure. Not sure what to think about the P/D changes. Sneak attack being better is nice, but Im pretty sure Id rather have shadow strike up at all times instead of swapping to repeater (Which is a really bad skill to use, as it costs 5 initiative while doing barely more damage than just attacking. It does apply 5 stacks of bleed now, but its still not worth 5 initiative). 
---
I have a question - Myself and many other GW2 players have/had a difficult time getting the "feel" right for a character in the game, that it feels too alien. Is this talked about in arenanet internally?
---
Holy FUCK I LOVED these banner changes. 
---
Welp... I need to understand how to do that then...
---
I'm glad they're giving scrapper a more distinct purpose of off-dps / off-support rather than having it compete uselessly with holo for dps.
---
Hopefully next up we can see a turret rework...
---
I will be able to play tempest in fractal again?
---
You could say SoI was feeling a bit "*inspired*"
---
But can you really disagree that it was a clunky, inconsistent and obscure behavior of a skill? Do we really need to have those just to increase the skill ceiling, or, if your bold claim "power chrono is essentially dead" is to be believed, increase the skill floor as well?
---
You like micromanagement, well you'll love the tedious nature of shuffling these banners. My job as a designer is justified!
---
So if the Warclaw has been delayed by layoffs then does that mean the WvW dev team was hit by layoffs?  or was Warclaw work not being carried out by WvW devs?
---
Surely if the WvW team has been hit in the round of layoffs that means everything coming out of that team in future is delayed or subject to being descoped entirely.
---
I have 4k Hours on my Chrono and I like this change lmfao shut up
---
yeah the glory of PvP and WvW has always been that you can really push every single skill in your bar to it's full potential, which is why I recommend everyone at least try it once.
---
Unless that skill is Shatterstone.
---
I love not taking banners, cause it's not worth it anymore.  "Let's make you do more work for less gain"  Anet in a nutshell.
---
are these all of the upcoming changes?
---
Question to fellow redditors: You think \[this\]([https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/843125#Comment\_843125](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/843125#Comment_843125)) is good feedback? 
---
3K+ hours on Chrono and I like these changes.
---
no Mirage nerfs in PvE!?  COME ON ANET!!!! WTF!?!?!?!?
---
PvE Reaper BUFFS POG
---
It's not even that significant of a nerf considering the CD got reduced too
---
These aren't even negative changes lmao
---
They kept hitting a clone. Some day they’ll get the real Chrono... but not today.
---
Was it fun to play though? If so, why do they feel the need to change it?
---
Nice assumption, but what else to expect from a patronising narcissist "you disagree with me therefore you must have no idea"
---
:)
---
Is anyone else a little underwhelmed with the revenant changes? I play it in WvW mostly, and I feel like this addresses none of the weirdness of the class. 
---
I still can't see Song of the Mists being that useful (though it does look a lot better), and the change to Targeted Destruction feels like it was done to encourage using Song of the Mists.
---
If I was in a large enough fight to get the full quickness, it might be nice, but 20% crit chance is a high price to pay for it. Especially if, in a 1v1, I only get 2s. Or it sounds like it can miss and I get 0? Compared to guaranteed 20% bonus crit on my constantly generated fury... I just don't see this being competitive.
---
And that was the most interesting part of this whole thing, to me, for revenant, so it feels a little like nothing changed at all.
---
&gt; I neither want your opinion, nor did I ask
---
You kinda did by posting on a public discussion platform. If you don't want replies you're free to just keep your thoughts to yourself.
---
Delete SOI already and buff wells a bit in return (maybe make them 10ppl if traited, after rebalancing accordingly). This is disgusting.
---
Stopped reading at "neo-marxist".  
---
Get bent, asshole.
---
I take it. Our chance to show them that this is the right approach. They can use it to test the waters, don't mind if it is born out of a failed patch.
---
These changes are very interesting, really looking forward for the patch now. Specially for the "Endgame" PvE scene, which has been stale as shit since HoT. 
---
So I applaud them for taking a leap with this patch so far, regardless of the players complaining about having their comfort zone shaken up. 
---
I don't understand the Signet of Ether change, can someone ELI5?
---
Yeah, "tools programmer" generally means internal tools for workflow and the like.
---
Sure, but that's the reason why GW2 is so dull. There is nothing to keep you playing after you've spent 2 microseconds on the newest story.
---
Well, technically it came a day late didn't it?
---
This was supposed to be *yesterday's* patch.
---
And you just pointed out one of the most controversial things about this company that I don't really wanna touch broadly in this topic: they give them way too much freedom to do whatever they want in their job related social media.
---
ARGUING with a developer, that's something that usually only happens in very small, unprofessional enterprises, not something you'd expect from one that handles as much money as Anet does.
---
Oh look, more nerfs to druids, chronos, warriors, guardians (what the fuck?) and more pointless changes to power rev, tempest, scrapper (LOL) and necro... and power reaper is still fucking worthless! and I still don't give a shit about scrapper! and healing tempest is still bringing nothing to the fucking table that a druid, a firebrand or a ren can't! AND MORE GEAR CHANGING FOR RAIDS CAUSE THEY FUCK AROUND WITH PRECISION CAP! 
---
Yay!
---
Fuck this. If I needed one reason to prolong my break after this barrage of disastrous news... Jk, I didn't. Sure as hell I ain't coming back so I can regear my characters and play stale, old content. I guess that if you play raids at a semi-hardcore level it's assumed you don't function like a normal human being and therefore enjoy spending hundreds of gold in a reverse gear treadmill for literally *no reason at all but to play catch up with these fuckers since there's nothing new: top builds will stay top and there's no fucking new content to play*. Fuck off, seriously, just fuck off. I can't take no more.
---
What? My original post did not make any broad statements about how viable Reapers are/were.  Simply that its utility skills may finally be useful.
---
Battle standard. Best safe-stomp in the game now, from far away, can even cast it, LoS behind a pillar then come back around when the skillcast is ending. Can also rally in the same breath it stomps, then it provides pressure.
---
Overall though, the elite skill's strongest quality is it's +100 meme factor.
---
SLAY with your banners friends, SLAY with your banners!
---
Aren't the bonus stats from banners applies to warrior only? It used to give 170 stat to allies and now its 100.
---
I can't believe it.......... Why would they do it, now that power chrono is getting more attention from everyone? It's not like it's the best dps class out there... No need to remove aftercast combo :(
---
It's utility skills are viable though, how would it be viable if it's skills aren't?
---
Perhaps you meant to say "Finally, Reaper has stronger utility skills", and if that is the case, fair enough.
---
Did.... did they just buff elementalists without nerfing them, specially tempest?! I might be the happiest ele in the world right now. These changes might not be perfect, but this is damn good start and I hope it keeps coming!
---
So are Mesmer dead in pve to? 
---
Damn, 1.7k  hours off to having a valid opinion.
---
Might as well die.
---
"THE WORLD IS ENDING!!! One second, lemme take a selfie to capture the apocalypse.... WHY DO I NOT HAVE INTERNET!?"
---
I mean if you want to get into semantics, it was supposed to be *3 weeks ago*.
---
But sure.
---
Wish they'd make Soul Barbs less annoying on reaper. Right now the damage modifiers keep you hostage to upkeeping chill and a 10 second countdown on shroud enter/exit, which is not that exciting of a gameplay experience. The changes to Cold Shoulder makes it seem like they want to go that way even more, though.
---
Man, I loved that build so much. It was one of those builds where I felt like I really could express my skill at a class. The feels good man moments when you see your dps sitting at 60k a good 10 seconds into your burst is just UGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. I would actually be so sad if they removed this just cause some people said: Chrono numbers high, I can't pull those numbers, nerf class plz anet. 
---
Banner uptime is literally the same, 60/64 sec (assuming alacity). And it is only positives from there, warrior can pretty much reset banner's cd, making it permanent even if alacrity is lacking and you no longer need two people to carry them from place to place. 
---
Stat rebalance tho. 
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **4th Cakeday** Apollo-Venkman! ^(hug)
---
It was not only fun, it was beautiful in my eyes. It was like a dance, convoking phantasms after phantasms, needing to be skilled for it to work.
---
I'll miss this feature so much...
---
It really sounds like there won't be an aftercast, so you're gonna end up using the CS as an opener (I guess? If you can't CS the SoE, I assume you're gonna have to CS the first 3 phantasms). Not to mention the banner and DT nerfs, meaning we're gonna need an extra shove to crit cap
---
Hey! Even worse!
---
I like these as well, but my only complaint is that I might have to delay my opening for alacrity since none of my skills apply ala when the fight starts. 
---
Also I still have to prestack which makes me sad. 
---
Really excited about these gyro changes! Hope they also squeeze in a buff to function gyro before release
---
Reaper is viable in PvE because of Reaper Shroud, access to Greatsword, and Reaper traits. 
---
I actually like the adjustment for Mirage. It was always awkward with dodging, since it was a lot longer, and I didn't have a physical dodge roll. Perhaps the adjustment might help me be able to switch between classes more easily. How I play Necro and Revenant seems mostly unaffected.
---
Banners will need to be picked up before it expires in order to get 60 sec of CD back - and that is substantial
---
I am **NOT** going to play the UI to maximize my gameplay, that is **NOT okay**
---
I have 3000 hours in GW2 and I still raid in it. My account value on GW2 efficiency is 160k gold if that is a good enough meter for you.
---
The problem isn't really that people enjoy GW2 in it's current form. The problem is, the game won't survive this way. If you seriously think it is going to make enough money by players that just log in to do new content for few days or are new, then you're just objectively wrong. The game needs a way to suck people in for it's own sake, not for mine.
---
I don't even want everything I described though. I just want some non-fluff content that is not "play once, then it's mindlessly grinding enemies in the area or simply not worth doing" like GW2 is. It's funny how you're against grind, yet you play a way grindier MMO than what FFXIV is for example. Because, you know, FFXIV actually rewards you for playing the game in a reasonable manner, not either 10 gold per hour with mindless grind or you whip out that credit card.
---
:(
---
Removing aftercast continuum split for power chrono is just a nail in the coffin for the class in terms of competitive dps.
---
Our purpose is pure! 
---
*distort*
---
I’m so glad to see this. Now they can actually compete for more static raid spots, haha.
---
Very happy about this!
---
Exactly. They didn't even offer alternatives to play. they just nerfed everything across the board and said good luck. Which solves nothing.
---
Just a hollow class of what it used to be. I don't care about being OP, I don't give two shits if other classes are stronger than me. I do care about enjoying what I play. 
---
Pretty sure the opener will still stay the same.
---
Make use of the 2X ToT wiht 1 Clone CS.
---
Alacrity will be out before they even use a skill.
---
is it just me or do scrappers now look like technology based elementalists.
---
Don't hurry back! 
---
# GOTTA GO POSTING THIS HERE THEN AFTER A CORPORATE SHILL DELETED MY POST.
---
So what we can take away from this  is...nothing. There's nothing new here being said. I'd say the team has  been shrinking for quite some time, now these layoffs effected some  people dealing with the GW2 game directly, but most were not.
---
It  would seem that many of those laid off did actually work on the game at  some time, and instead of having these people back, as some would have  surely liked to work with those people again, they are finding that it's  not the case and they have lost their jobs.
---
The  second paragraph is a lot of separate facts and is really put together  to make it seem as if stability is still on the table and the entire  place doesn't have the remaining fortitude of jelly.
---
Let's  break that down and cut out all the useless fatty bits that are just  pandering to expectations when we read people giving news like this.
---
* *The next episodes of Living World are already in development .*
---
We know this already.
---
* *Swiss tournament support is coming to PvP*
---
Ok  so maybe this is something the fringe Swiss community has been asking  for, not quite sure why they can't organise their own tournaments like  the rest of us. Seems a bit specifically selfish.
---
* *more WvW events coming soon*
---
WvW  has been pretty stale and the format has mostly been the same. You go  into WvW knowing what to expect. Are they trying to add PvE stuff into  the WvW stuff to make it interesting? That's not going to work.
---
* *return of the Super Adventure Festival*
---
Proof  that you can sack people and their work will live on, I suppose. All  those people harping on about that one guy getting the boot meaning it  will never return can eat their words.
---
Then  you've got this part, and this is where I was talking about separate  facts because this has nothing to do with what's happening right now.
---
* *Our  long-term plans for the game like World Restructuring and  large-scale  improvements to quality of life are still in the works.*
---
Now  I'm looking at these as dot points because that's what these are. These  terms are all being spit balled around the studio I'm sure but no one  actually knows what these things actually mean or look like yet. Sounds  like the restructuring could be the reduction of servers. Hopefully it's  that rather than a WoW style Tyria encasing Scarlet level fuck around  with the world map. You've just sacked some people Anet, best not make  the ones left do the jobs of several people. And QoL? That's insider  speak, not to us players, they are talking about retention of players,  that's it honestly.
---
But further down, we have this thing, just look at this.
---
* *As  the proverbial dust settles in the next few days we're going to   re-evaluate our schedules to make sure that our releases are realistic   and allow us the time to make sure they hit our internal quality bar.   This means that some updates are going to see delays, like the recent   Warclaw, as we regain our focus.*
---
Now,  I don't know what kind of people were required for this thing but I'm  guessing that some of the people laid off were not the artists or  designers but people needed to keep software and hardware running, and  to keep the servers stable. The Warclaw WvW stuff was supposed to be  this weekend I thought, so I'm calling BS on it not being ready, let's  be real here. The warclaw was 100% ready to go, you just don't have the  people at the back end anymore to make sure everything runs smoothly.
---
And  if Anet are willing to risk this (and let's be honest the one's making  the decisions here don't give a shit because from a manager hands off  product standpoint it doesn't effect them), which was supposed to inject  a bit of life back into the game, and have the whole thing fall apart  so that's it is unplayable, the warclaw as unplayable, well what else  are they going to do? Everything is going to crumble because these  management people will see the product as untenable and they will keep  cutting until no one is left, while wondering why they have not seen  overwhelming improvement in studio moral.
---
Now  as I broke down at the top, what we have coming are a few things with  this massive pit in the center and those long term goals off in the  future. Paragraphs one, three and five are useless, smoke and mirrors to  try and get past us while in the others just telling us things we  already came to expect. You can tell that effort was put into making the  post look cohesive and thought out and directed towards us, but when  you're aware that someone is saying things to get you to give them  money, it becomes very easy to break down what is being said here.
---
We're  not investors, we're not making money off this game. It's not even  about spending time in the game. I enjoy GW2, when I play it. But trying  to keep me on board with things that don't interest me, and this overly  positive pushing this post has, while because we're smart enough, I'd  hope, to know that everything is really behind a curtain and that  there's very little actual transparency, it doesn't really bode well.  That's because we are not the investors, we are the investment. The term  player investment has been misconstrued all these years and that's  really what's on show here.
---
We need to  face the facts, the game is dying and it's not going to be your fault  when people lose their jobs. That's the most important thing to take  away here because there have been a lot of posts about people getting  upset about particular individuals leaving. People are still going to  lose their jobs, it's not up to you to pay their bills and make sure  they remain in the job. Some of you might be thinking that if you don't  support the game it will be your fault, well to that I say no. Don't  feel bad for not spending your money and don't let this corporation  guilt trip you into doing something you don't want to do.
---
So what do you think? I know what I think, but maybe you think differently.
---
Not only that, it was highly flavorful because you had to predict things when you wanted to distort *and* go back in time to old positions and cooldowns with CDs. I don't mention that enough. 
---
ｙｉｋｅｓ 
---
I think you can still CS the SoE, it's just now, if we CS in the previous aftercast period, we don't have our phantasms refreshed when in CS. 
---
Sounds like something a 5+ hours chrono would say tbh
---
That's exactly what it means
---
Tfw you geared one up a month ago and never got around to playing it. Oops
---
So, this is awesome. Can we be happy about this coming out a week ahead of the patch itself to give people time to speculate and consider?
---
Let's see this continue, ArenaNet!
---
Fair point, but considering anets balance record they won't bring the fun back once they introduced consistency.
---
Gyros have always been visible and this does not imply that will change.  It does, however, explicitly state that they can no longer be targeted by the enemy.
---
Kinda bummed if it does kill power chrono, it was actually super fun and the only class I’ve been playing also. 
---
Thank you for this point of view. Mesmer is my main since I started, 600h in and I just got a condi renegade as my second character, but it's far from enjoyable so far. I don't know, it's fun but it's not "satisfying", you know...
---
Maybe I am overreacting to the change, though I know the dps loss will be real.
---
This makes me so friggin' happy with my recent investment in full zerker ascended armor and making him look like a member of kiss. 
---
So we're stat changing a few berserk pieces / getting some assassin trinkets / using cheaper food (fuck yeah)?
---
Is it on the wiki yet?
---
Because its fucking boring having passive skills that do nothing and set the meta.
---
\*affected
---
I know they have always been visible that is why I asked.
---
It would be interesting if they weren't visible. 
---
hmmm. So I case ToT and CS in aftercast of it, then drop wells and SoI? That might work actually, since on the way back SoI should extend both ala and quick. 
---
Yeah, just give us expansions. It worked great for GW1
---
I have been wondering for quite a while how the aggro for encounters works to make a tank usefull in all fights.  Do you know where, if there is anywhere, that has a breakdown of how GW2 aggro works so that you can use it?
---
minion and well is still better for dps especilly when you want to upkeep chill with Haunt
---
You're not, the problem is that this change will be with us for a while. I know how it feels to change classes and find a new "identity".  Good luck.
---
https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/843125#Comment_843125
---
This has changed. It is less rewarding for you if you have lots of experience or skill on the class, but it's easier to play and afk on. 
---
I love the sound of the Tempest changes.  Reason to pull out the healing gear again!
---
I've never seen such anger over numbers in a video game. Go pick up a new hobby if you're getting that worked up. 
---
Tbh, theyve set the meta long enough.
---
Because people are desperate and need validation for their investment in the game. Which is a natural reaction I guess.
---
I'm glad all this PR talk actually work to calm down people, but for me this confirms absolutely nothing that we already didn't know. The real test is how the game is going to develop from here, not empty words.
---
...And I am not trying to claim words are worthless in general, they are only kind of worthless coming from a company in a roundabout way. Because the only purpose for that is "please keep playing", even if their actual plan was to shut down the game soon (which I don't think is the case, but just as an example).
---
Yeah... it’s *there* but it’s not **there**.
---
Also, I still don’t see taking songs over the other grandmasters. Especially when dragon still gives burning and dragon is used in power builds. Very strange on the face of it.
---
Right off the bat, GvG in GW1 and GW2 are COMOLETELY different. Most people who GvGed in GW1 don't really consider GW2 actual GvG, which is understandable as it's not an official game mode, but to us GW2 players, its as real as it gets. 
---
GvG in GW2 is essentially a sub section of WvW, the large casual RvR mode of GW2. It's completely community run, as I mentioned before it's not officially supported by Anet, although they have done some things to help the GvG scene out a bit (Eotm Arena). 
---
Since everything is organized by the community, there aren't actual in game events or an actual ruleset that has to be followed, most things are just decided by the community, and agreed on between guilds. 
---
If you'd like to find out more info, the EU GvG Discord that has been active for well over a year, is completely open to the public, you can join with this link: discord.gg/uyuPxCN
---
If you have anymore questions, feel free to ask away! 
---
Cheers!
---
When did they announce a balance patch for 3 weeks ago?
---
We're still going to deal less damage... Quite a bit, too
---
That's very true lol
---
Cheers mate 
---
Can't wait
---
To regear it all onto a Weaver
---
As someone who has stuck by hammer scrapper despite its many deficiencies, I am super keen to see these changes.
---
it's apparently just what i'm noticing over and over and over today, the beef
---
I've had no bugs loading into fractals on my tempest. Maybe reset your router. 
---
  
---
I'm really annoyed by the Righteous Instincts nerfs. Just straight losing 25% crit chance is a HUGE blow to dps DH and core guard (pvp). None of the buffs for guard touch the DPS builds, so this is just a nerf. Where the hell was guard overperforming to justify this nerf? DH and core guard are only barely viable in PVP as it is.   
---
Good to see mirage nerfs, though i'm afraid it probably just shifts mirage back to a more power base build.    
---
Necro buffs are pretty much meaningless, with nightfall as the only significant buff.   
---
Good to see them addressing the perma-stealth thief, though prob not enough of a nerf. The buffs are completely on the wrong skills to buff thief the way they describe.   
---
War was pretty much only viable for being the banner slave. Probably still retains that, but where are the war buffs to compensate for the nerfs. Again, where are wars overperforming.
---
&gt; 
---
I like these as well, but my only complaint is that I might have to delay my opening for alacrity
---
Exactly what I meant by "clunky as fuck". They try to balance this with Tides of Time, I don't think it is enough, but we'll see. But delaying is never fun.
---
The other part is that boon extension SoI is just too much hidden information. That is the wrong direction I speak of.
---
They didn't nerf infinite reflect on dodge for Mirage, which is the most OP thing about it. :/
---
Im serious though thanks i didnt notice.
---
ToT&gt; Cs &gt; SOI &gt; Action &gt; CS ends &gt; ToT &gt; SOI &gt; Aciton &gt; Mimic &gt; SOI &gt; SOI
---
&gt;Unless you have a marketing or social media/community management degree and can provide sourced data proving your point
---
I'm not sure I completely agree. There are some situations that are unclear and going to require clarification, and there are other things that are unintuitive, and only studies will illuminate those. But the study of rhetoric is as old as language. Many of what are broadly considered the greatest works of oratory precede the the existence of the university.
---
I think its reasonable to say that objectively, if things are not going well, silence makes people nervous. That's just how people work. They look to leadership for plans or solutions.
---
Lip service may work initially, and for the most part its all a rough spot deserves - you don't want to overreact. But when a problem becomes longstanding and systemic, lip service only makes it *worse*. It breeds cynicism, lowers morale, and gives the impression of disconnected or uncaring leadership.
---
The only solution is threefold. First, to acknowledge the reality of the problem, thus validating the experience of the people - this gets them on your side and makes it appear that you are not part of it. Secondly, to articulate a plan to deal with the problem. This creates a degree of comforting certainty for the future and makes it seem like you're in control. Thirdly, to act on the plan and show results of progress as soon as possible - the longer you go without doing this, the worse it can get. Ultimately though, this scheme depends on an ability to deliver. If there's no ability to deliver, then no amount of words will save the leadership. This is one of the first things taught in any leadership or rhetoric class, because its proven and intuitive.
---
I'll grant you, however, that this is fundamentally about how to control people and keep them happy. I'm operating under the assumption that a happy playerbase is going to pay up more, and be a more productive asset in other ways, primarily various forms of viral marketing. If making people happy *necessarily* made companies money, then loot boxes wouldn't exist. I have yet to see anybody who likes them, but maybe some studies would prove that attitudes towards them are more popular than I think. Personally, I think companies are just exploiting a communal predisposition towards gambling addiction, so I'd find any positive results somewhat suspect.
---
In any case, what I'm trying to get at with all that is that there are levels of failure in communication that are so fundamental and obvious, pretty much anybody can criticize them and not only be justified, but pretty much objectively correct. It's like if a chef burns a very easy dish. I don't need to run a respectable restaurant to know how to avoid burning my macaroni and cheese. There are proven, verified ways of dealing with fear, uncertainty, and doubt. They just need to be used. That's my two cents, anyway.
---
Mimic also got a cooldown reduction. Their interaction is about the same as it used to be.
---
Unpopular opinion: Yes.
---
Rock-paper-scissors metas exist across gaming--take Pokemon or Magic the Gathering for example. Traditional RPS means diversity-driven competition: fire&gt;water&gt;grass&gt;etc, but diversity driven cooperation (the Trinity) shakes out the same. To put it simply, a "solved" RPS meta is far more diverse than homogeneous metas. WoW is the Trinity posterchild, requiring at least three different classes to metagame. Comparatively, when GW2 launched, the meta meant everyone playing the same build of the same class until it got nerfed. If *every* class can DPS, tank, and heal, the class that does all three the best is definitively *the* best class.
---
A massive caveat here is that RPS metas aren't flawless. League of Legends switched to an autofill system that will occasionally force players to play support. Magic the Gathering allows sideboards, so after game one you can swap in cards than patch up your weaknesses. However, the only way I've seen homogeneous metas diversify is by inventing gatekeeper mechanics that require a specific archetype.
---
Similarly, I will grant GW2 one point over its RPS competitors; simply by re-traiting and re-gearing a character, literally EVERY class can clear solo PvE content, and that is no mean feat of balance.
---
That said I genuinely don't know a single *healthy* homogeneous endgame meta. If buffing, healing, or tanking aren't relevant, you can trust players to find and demand the highest damage class for endgame. Right now in GW2 we have Chronojail, because rather than shifting alacrity onto *more* classes ANet keeps trying to nerf the *only* class that has it consistently. The sooner we acknowledge that diversity is at least as important as solo viability, we'll be stuck tripping over the same DPS benchmarks and builds.
---
All said, the difference between a gatekeeping mechanic and a diversifying one is a thin, blurred line.
---
Such feels from this. I love Aurene, and this is an amazing song that feels like a tribute to her. 
---
That will never happen haha
---
How many specs don't already supply their own fury through incidental minor traits or weapon skills, though?
---
I don't understand the concern.  You want your skills to have no animations?
---
Thought banner wait still benches high
---
It'll already be charging before the shade gets dropped. Punch f5, wait 2 seconds, summon shade, deliver big instant hot
---
I didn't want your opinion, but you posted.
---
Sugar, you're posting on Reddit. If you can't handle conversation, don't bother posting and write in your diary instead. 
---
I feel the same way. I also think it is weird that they talk about buffing power than nerfing the dwarf brick road utility.
---
If two chronos aren't enough, just bring more. Chrono **is** the hydra
---
Thats because its not changing. Honestly this is a good thing, and that may sound weird but let me explain why:
---
We really don't need more ridiculous res power. Merciful Intervention and Well of Blood + Transfusion are already ridiculous. 
---
Guaranteed stomp with the gyro is just silly. Counterplay is good, even if other classes don't have it right now, they will eventually be nerfed in the future.
---
Chill is a hugely powerful condition, it makes sense that it needs to be worked to upkeep but gives even bigger payoff. 
---
Yes.  It mostly nerfs its interaction with echo and CS, which is for the better. 
---
Makes you take more boon duration for wells, which in turn lowers your dmg output. Problem is, the playstyle changes again. Not sure if for the better, but considering how wells and SoI work I doubt it.
---
&gt; And honestly, 3 seconds of boons is just not even funny anymore.
---
I'd really like to see the reaction of a player new to mesmers to this skill's description the first time they see it. Here they are, on a druid that provides ridiculous amounts of might every time they sneeze, and they're reading for the first time that SoI increases boons' duration by a whooping 3 seconds with a 0.75s cast time on a ~~30~~ 20 secs cooldown. Surely this must be a joke. Surely it scales from concentration!
---
...it doesn't?
---
Oh...
---
the most exciting thing for me when GW2 was announced was that we could finally fucking jump.  
---
got it as soon as it came out but it felt so damn different i ended up just going back to gw1 anyways lol
---
Technically you can watch Dragonball Z while running the Mystic Forge, just have DBZ on another monitor (or on a TV in the background) while clicking manually.
---
No, why would they be?
---
So I'm understanding correctly... In addition to pets we'll have to micromanage spirits because the active teleports it to us and is now the only way they buff allies. Heaven forbid I set the spirits near my team while I run around doing anything else. Oh, and now fewer boons because active is still on 20 second recharge. 
---
This is what we want for the sake of "more active gameplay"?
---
Hmmm, SoI with mimic is 6 second of both boons, favoured towards ala, if you take double well, that's 10 seconds of boons each when at 100% BD. IDK which one is more worth it honestly lol. 
---
But who is getting paid significantly more? A new hire, or a 15 year vet of the company? While it sucks that a lot of tenured employees were let go it probably was because it wasn't possible to keep paying them all.
---
Also if they only cut the new blood they (probably) would have had to cut a significantly higher number of employees to compensate the difference, and that probably would leave them with not enough employees to stay afloat. 
---
Until other healers can give 10man might Druid will be brought to every fucking fight so making it feel worse to play accomplished nothing. A 20sec CD on the boons from spirits will make them worse to play and as they tick away health healing them will be annoying as healing skills are capped at 5. The solution isnt nerfing druid just give other healers 10man might or better might generation on all of them.
---
I'm so happy we can see the balance notes early. I was so anxious waiting for these and when it was delayed I thought I was gonna melt into a nervous pile of goo.
---
I'm glad power Rev got some small buffs, especially shackling wave. After the cast time nerf it felt very unrewarding to use, glad they've made up for it now. Shame that condi Renegade got nerfed but it was coming. :/
---
Judging from the downvotes, either they are used to playing the UI or they have just accepted it as the norm
---
Gross.
---
I imagine we are finally at a point where renegade+firebrand will actually be taken on occasion. Still need Druid and Warrior, though. Even after the banner+spirit nerfs, they are still big. And druid still has glyph of empowerment to boot.
---
We are getting close to not having any classes that are 100% necessary in all cases, which is nice. Just a few more patches and then banners+spirits+glyph of empowerment will be removed lol.
---
Just honestly happy to see Chrono reduced to this. Not because I do not like Chrono, but because I am sick of seeing "GLF Chrono 4/5 or 9/10"
---
Congrats now engineer will be top meta in every gamemode.
---
Mostly the support aspect I guess which is really nice to see. That weave self earth seems very interesting...
---
I guess what he is saying is that he'd like our Armor to gain "Raid experience" or something. Which is good, I guess.
---
It's not something I'd ever play though, because then they'll just keep on releasing Raids that require more and more "Raid exp" in order for you to access them. Not something a newbie will ever get to. IMO such an underhanded tactic just allows the content to be accessible to a select few. To gain anything good from it, you need to take it as a second job, and then ... why am I even playing Guild Wars 2? I'd rather just play WoW or FFXIV then.
---
All those combo field is a Hammer scrapper wet dream.
---
Combo'd with Elixir Gun as a staple, it really opens up alot of in depth interactions as a Support/Tank/Bruiser Scrapper.
---
Scrappers are gonna become more versatile with the changes for sure instead of simply being an Engineer+ wielding a melee weapon.
---
Only power thief builds have it permanently. Other classes provide ~50-66% uptime to themselves which even with two chronos will not be sufficient to make permanent without an additional source. 
---
Thing is, people don't like the role and responsibility. That won't change. Maybe it'll get better with more viable alternatives (I believe so), but it won't change completely.
---
I don't think they'll ever get revenants right unless they go back and look at some of the fundamental design issues they've baked into the profession.
---
I imagine they meant function similarly to wells, not an actual well skill type.
---
The warrior banner buff for insta stomp shows they're open to the idea :)
---
greaaaaat
---
We're going to back to fractional crap-boons soon. 
---
"0.75 second of boon, coming right up, don't use it all at once! wait 20 seconds for cooldown! "
---
Waiting for necro changes to go live and make scourge be more clunky to play. On top of cast delay of shade skills from previous patches together with 3sec delay for damage in this patch will make it extremely difficult to try to survive unless you are in middle of 50+ people. They keep pushing scourge this way instead of actually nerfing boons, damage and corrupt spam in wvw. Just making it more and more clunky to play.
---
Anet is overall very bad at balancing, not really anything new. Your anger is understandable, but you should be used to this now. Raiding in this game is difficult, but not because of the bosses or the "toxic raid community", but rather because they are destroying the meta with each balance patch more and more, while adding (almost) nothing to compensate, and at the same time shrinking the already small raid community even more.
---
They have their own guild, and I tend to screenshot them when they're on. Lost track of how many I ran into tbh.
---
There's a couple that give me a giggle. One character named "I'm a developer", and a pet named Arenapet.
---
You don't need to pick them up at all. If we assume that warrior gets proper doses of alacrity, banner uptime's going to be nearly permanent. Picking them up for CD reset should be great for phase transitions or moving bosses. The only bad thing about these changes is smaller stat gain, down by 55 with trait.
---
While I understand that Renegade was doing very well on large golems, I still feel that the nerf (however slight) was not needed without a mirage nerf. Renegade competes with mirage on every fight where'd you potentially take it and yet it's the one that gets nerfed. Mirage needs to be toned down too. (This is in Raids of course, I'm sorry to those who played Mirage in other game modes.)
---
Really?! Another rotation to learn and probably new gear calculations?
---
As a chrono doing Raids since the beginning every week, this is really getting me stressed out. Nobody wants to play chrono annymore and even my static has struggles finding new ones. I love chrono, I really do or I wouldn't have 6700h on it, but another change so soon is... disheartening.
---
Just delete SoI. Reword it to be something else entirely, give us wells that give boons at each puls and get done with it. I can't battle the UI and hidden informations about my squad's uptime with new variables every 2 months. I am getting tired, and lots of chronos are too.
---
Wells are different on each class.
---
On necro they are very offensive.
---
On chrono they are a mix.
---
On scrapper they will be mainly support and follow you.
---
So, around 10k gems you could've gotten
---
Sure if you want a 120 second cd on function gyro x)
---
So first off, we just got the patch notes for a major release posted and there may be some build changes. I would hold off a little bit for the changes to go live and people rework builds. That being said druid probably won't change much and will still want harrier axe/warhorn. Staff is a secondary weapon used mainly for burst healing and utility. Should also be mentioned that the [druid weapon collection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Yggdrasil_\(achievement\)) gives you an ascended staff that you can [stat swap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing). In general it's better to use weapon chests on 2 handed weapons that are normally more expensive I just wouldn't personally use it on a staff for druid (especially since there are 2 elite spec collections).
---
I'm worried about NCSoft's statement that this will allow them to "grow and aquire". This is the second such statement I've seen from a major company laying off people this week.
---
If you're letting people go for financial reasons, isn't acquiring other companies a bit premature?
---
if anyone is shouting hatred, they're just trolling. negativity on the other hand is due to the state the game is in. i know trying to pretend everything is okay is what people like you do but that is denial, plain and simple. most people wouldn't be negative if there was nothing to be negative about, sadly there is. if you can't see it then perhaps you need glasses.
---
Like every other time folks got the vapors about dead gaem no expansions evarr etc, this is not maintenance mode, this is 'hold tight while we figure out how to get things going again because everything's been derailed'. It's not that hard to get, but folks like you just want to wail. Leave already.
---
Give them time to figure out what they can do and how long it will take to do it. They don't KNOW right now.
---
Just like the last time people assumed ANet meant no expac-- we will probably get another one, but it's going to be a while. Let them get back on their feet.
---
Oops I was dumb by the looks of it.
---
Chrono main mindset had me look at alacrity as a 50% bonus, not 33%
---
Dumb me :P
---
Not really. You almost never need block penetration and reaper has never had any issues stacking 25 might with just auto attacks. And the damage, even with 40% boost would only make it like 550 damage every 20-25 seconds (before alac.), but Im pretty sure that is like 2 hits from the shadow minion, which takes something like 3-5 seconds to occur--meaning the pet, without even considering the active, is like 4-5x the damage...and a more useful active.
---
The reaper utilities just dont do anything useful in PvE. Rise is the closest to being useful, but even then, you dont typically want to give up dps for defense. Reaper is just very self sufficient, so it doesnt need more self buffs. If they made the shouts group buffs (and better than just might/block pen), they would be ina  potentially useful spot.
---
70. 100 is still a lot.
---
I think this should be how it works? It's possible that it means we won't be able to get all 3 phantasms inside CS with a 1-clone split.
---
Oboi more thief nerfs, wish the balance team was part of the employee chopping block.
---
I don't know why you creeps are downvoting this, it's the right attitude to have. Let ANet wrangle out what they can do and how fast they can do it, it sounds like once they do things will chug along again.
---
Scrapper will always have a place due to its very consistent healing IN ADDITION to good superspeed uptime, very very high cleansing potential (which ele is can also do), as well as stealth and reveals.
---
Don't get me wrong, Tempest is also REALLY good right now, before the patch even hits. The immobs it can output alongside really good heals and res potential give it its niche.
---
Both classes have a niche, and both can work in conjunction with one another. 
---
When is anet going to learn to stop nerfing chrono and start buffing firebrand boons?
---
Ahh, Ok. I thought I was missing something.
---
apart from pvp where its not been meta for 3-4 months x)
---
I hope in the future an end-user intuitive approach to make them work comes along so I can use it! I'm not skilled enough to mess with shaders, and don't know anything about them. GW2 looks so washed out and poorly coloured without Reshade. Hopefully someday! 
---
See that's the big difference between you and I. Where you see shortcomings, I don't. I have tons of fun playing this game with my guild and friends. I enjoy this game and look forward to what it gives me next. I don't look at buying gems as me doing the company some kind of favor they owe me for. I look at it as buying something that I get an immediate return on in the form of items in the game. I paid them and content of the game and best of all I can play it when I want without any worries because I don't have to pay ANet for permission to play the game I already bought. Where as you see me being the bad guy here and you're the wounded party but the truth is your just an entitled child and I'm a reasonable adult.
---
I disagree with all the pearl-clutchers bitching that the end is nigh, and I want ANet to succeed, but please, please, ANEt--
---
Stop wasting our time. You've wasted our time for a long time, now, stringing us along. You can do better. We want you to do better. People wouldn't be raging if they didn't care.
---
Please, please, please stop wasting your time. This IP was once competitive with ESO and FF, and now it's not. It didn't have to end up like this, but you moved vital resources away, underfunded and half-assed the rest. Please, please, pleeeeeaaaaaaaase stop squandering your game and your players' time and patience.
---
Thank you.
---
overall sad by guardian nerf power might drop out cause of that trait change, necro power might push past 30k finally and shouts might be viable low chance but might, thief is fine which im happy, warrior banner nerf why? least its condi is still good but still questioning the banner nerf. rev's condi might take a hit and it power might gain we'll see but its power last I remember was pretty bad still.
---
honoestly i'm hoping for necro power raid viablity just an option i can choose to bring and gets less stale then playing thief rifle/dagger or fb and condi warrior
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
So we just...Pick the banner up every now and then, and the potency of the banners got nerfed, so we essentially got nerfed and also have a clunky way of banner-gameplay now, with a small bonus of repositioning being easier.
---
The buff to inspiring Battle Standard doesn't make up for the damage loss personally either, we lose 55 statpoints on both banners. I get that Arenanet doesn't want certain classes to feel mandatory, but can we then atleast have our own damage not suffer for that? Kind of unneccessary when you already don't deal the best DPS as a Banner Warrior.
---
&gt;forgot Alacrity on non-Chronos is 33%
---
Except it is 25%
---
Even more support Tempest buffs!? Please and thank you. It's my favorite healing spec to play. So many patches lately have been giving it some love, and it makes me happy every single time.
---
It's about time Gyro's got looked at. I really enjoyed them, but man were they frustrating when they didn't work well. Now if only this means Function Gyro revives players more reliably. It's been terrible lately with refusing to revive, that is if it hasn't always been that way.
---
So so good to see changes to Rangers' spirits and Warriors' banners. There's still some unique buffs going on, but at least we got some of it toned down as well as getting some quality-of-life changes mixed in there as well.
---
Nerf one skill, two more will take its place
---
SoI active is artificially kept alive only by raid meta and is a complete joke in every other situation for the last few patches. They should just pull the plug already.
---
Sleepy brain causes many mistakes
---
Nerf one, two more take it's place. Hail Hydra!
---
In tears about the death of pchrono... damn you, anet, damn you for ruining a fun, not-OP build :(
---
Yeah, what /u/tinybarbarian means is that you, as the warrior, lose 55 stats through this change. Whether that's good or bad is up for debate, but this whole thing is a nerf all around, with you needing to fiddle with banners more thus losing GCDs - especially with how long their casttime is - and a numerical nerf, albeit a small one.
---
Yes, they killed it with that change.  No more quad-cast of phantasms for the initial burst.  It is only as good as the sustain, or the low-skilled players ability to use SoE once with CS and then again after.
---
Nerfing Chronos without buffing alternative sources only means you end up using more Chronos, not less.
---
Basically what I will be doing... going back to my condi weaver main.
---
That's wrong. The cool down will always be 20 seconds whether the banner is down or up making it much easier to reposition or make sure the banner isn't being wasted on an immune or non burn phase
---
It's just a bug/mechanic of the ghost form. You get the same thing if you use the Strawberry Ghost, and those have been in since the first Halloween. 
---
Its not  much of a change, really only for Raids where Toughness draws boss aggro. You could get like 500 toughness from abilities with weaver so you had to be careful your tank had over 1600T
---
Probably trying to encourage people playing something other than Shiro-Glint in PvP and WvW.
---
3/5 wells are not used anwhere
---
Good point :)
---
[I'm the op 2nd acc on mobile]
---
I can agree to the inconsistency among other skills yes; skill does it's effect and goes on cool down, simple as. However due to the satisfying rotation it creates I would largely disagree with it being clunky, as well as it being obscure (because let's be real, the aftercast of SOE is enormous). And it's not really a bold claim at all, losing 25%ish of your damage when the benchmark is 33k is enough to send it 6ft under. I agree that having interactions like this aren't necessary to increase the skill ceiling but why should they be removed if they do? Seems pointless to remove an interaction that requires a level of skill to execute just because it's an outlier in the was that it works on a mechanical level. In summary, I agree that these interactions aren't necessary, but this one in particular makes a dps option viable and adds to diversity so who does it hurt to leave it alone. Completely removing a dps class from the game over something so minor feels like the nuclear option for tackling the issue.
---
I see you're another person of culture. 
---
Gonna be annoying to me because I enjoyed not having to turn my character to look at enemies to use that skill. It made for a very nice flow between targets. 
---
How many maps really depends on how many episodes. I hope that ArenaNet scraps both the rigid principles of "one map per episode" and "six episodes per season" that they seemed to have developed.
---
Season 3's plot suffered greatly IMO due to the six episode limit, and could have greatly benefited from having another two or even three episodes to truly flesh out the White Mantle and Primordus/Jormag subplots. With six, it felt like "Here is the White Mantl-oh no Primordus (and Jormag I guess?)! Oh White Mantle are are dea-BALTHAZAR! Time for a quick cleanup." There wasn't a real proper exploration of Jormag, the norn reaction to the tooth, the White Mantle, or Lazarus (who vets had waited 5 years for).
---
I felt that Joko's subplot could have done better with one or two extra episodes too. And definitely could have done better with a return to maps (\*coughSun'sRefugecough\*).
---
It's okay for some episodes to have a full map that won't be returned to again, but I feel that some episodes should also share a map that gets expanded. Depends largely on the plot, I guess.
---
But above that, what they need to stop is "each map per episode requires that specific episodes and story progression to enter"; like Silverwastes and Dry Top, anyone with HoT should be able to enter S3 maps, and anyone with PoF should be able to enter S4 maps. It's fine that the story directs players to the map, but requiring the story to be played (or a consumable bought) to access the map is a hindrance more than a benefit imo.
---
The main benefit to this is being able to return to old maps without linking that map to the episode. For example, what if Episode 3 started in Istan rather than Amnoon (why would Dragon's Watch go all the way back up north if their threat is in southern Elona anyways?), which directly changes the potential directions of the plot.
---
Disappointing necro changes, inconsequential.
---
I don't mind so much that it's being nerfed and changed all the time, it's more the amount of nerfs/changes and the way it's nerfed/changed. I can see why people don't want to play this class. The gear is much harder to get than DPS (you also need an extra set for tanking) and then you get the gear and learn the rotation and bam it's changed again.
---
God damn, I've needed to regear Chrono so many times (with so many rotation changes) and I've only been playing for about a year. 
---
The reason it's much easier to find two druids than two Chronos is because Druid doesn't change (in play style or gear required) nearly as much as Chrono.
---
I wish it was nerfed on its damage or some other metric. I still don't get why SoI wasn't just changed to only share Alacrity and Quickness, but hey. 
---
Or, maybe something better than changing Chrono every class, buff other classes!
---
I guess all of this has already been said, but... yeah. This is the easiest path to make players not want to play Chrono less than they already do.
---
Yep. This subreddit has been incredibly hostile to criticism of Arena.net's development practices and schedules from the beginning, starting with the Ascended Armor debacle shortly after the game's release. I hope we can finally wake up and be critical moving forward.
---
Wells all behave the same across classes.
---
AoE dropped and pulses.
---
Gyro follows Engi and pulses and is destructible.
---
Fear not this night, gw2 will not go away
---
If you sign find it fun though, just don't play it. It's not a meta/op option anywhere in the game (talking about the improved alacrity variant, not the broke shit OP danger time cheese build which was rightfully nerfed into the ground)
---
I see the same kind of reaction you described from Chronos every patch and I can't quite relate.
---
I dislike that they lowered the skill ceiling over time but apart from that I can't say that there has really been much of a change. It's changing values and cooldowns back and forth causing skills to gain or lose priority over others but in the end Chrono does the same things (almost) the same way as it used to.
---
Damn. I work most of Saturday. Wish I could come along
---
yay time to learn a new chrono rotation!...again!
---
With alacrity cooldown will be 64 sec and the bannnerbuffs last longer than the banner anyway (buff lasts 5 seconds, and is renewed every 3 seconds). That's 100% uptime without picking up. Get a proper alacrity source and you only need to pick banners up when you move out of range.
---
Chrono runes never did that.
---
Its not in pve.
---
Did you even read it? Def going to feel it as they only give buffs when using the one use which has a 20sec CD with a cast time and they drain health so they risk sniping heals from the group with heals having 5man cap
---
Everyone needs a thicker skin, especially the PR people for a major corporation (whose job it is to handle criticism). Even discussing WvW issues on the forum is grounds for a permanent ban.
---
Heh. You linked my post. I wrote it at 3am or so, and I think that should tell you everything haha.
---
Unfortunately we live in an age of incredible personal fragility. People are coddled so much that they act psychotic when the real world intrudes on their bubbles.
---
"""toxic""" """problematic""" """alt-right""" """gamergate"""
---
Make scg more clunky to use and community uses it to make more op combination and the cycle continues.
---
Ok can we now start to run quickbrand + renegate? i mean druids and chronos are getting fucked again, lets just move on....
---
4+ months for this crap that looks like it took 2 days at most to scrape up.
---
Those sub 5% damage buffs for power herald and reaper are a joke, and daredevil goes untouched while the only competitive condition specs get hit as power DPS reigns supreme in most bosses.
---
Its not needed ideally. If not playing ideally then this whole conversation doesn't even apply. 
---
Next Tuesday
---
No I was just surprised to see it here, honestly. The official forums are a dark place, and my posts usually get deleted or I get banned, or they get ignored by the devs. Nobody who values their time really posts long explanations, because we never get a response. I thought I'd use this recent shake up at least once to try to get one or two messages through. I know it's my last effort and try at that...
---
Which is also why I highly appreciate your own thoughts. We need more of that, especially in the lights of recent events. Doesn't matter if we all agree or disagree. I'm happy if we don't resignate and give up. So by all means, go ahead and link and add your own thoughts and disagree or agree. I love it. Best wishes to you and your static, I know your pain.
---
Oh I don't think it's still as fun. That's what I meant when I said lowering the skill ceiling as in removing distortion share and phantasm management. I just don't think that the following frequent mini patches after those major changes really had any impact.
---
This is great but Tempest won't be able to share vigor to 10 players. Vigor and Protection were Tempest's two main draws as a mobile combat healer so to an extent I find this a but unfortunate.
---
On the plus side, 10 man Aftershock magnetic aura, 10 man stun break, 10 man rebound are going to be insane.
---
Don't play if you dont like it. Is not good for mental health.
---
lol a 40% buff on a skill that does 3-4k damage means it turns into 6-7k damage every 25+ seconds, hardly the damage of a greatsword autoattack....and the active effects of these shouts are still worthless in PvE.
---
It will still be wells and signet.
---
Oh I'm not playing power dps chrono. I'm playing (involuntarily) regular support chrono, which also uses your filthy aftercast trick as per [SC]'s rotation.
---
And as you might have noticed from my post higher in this comment tree, my arguments weren't that I didn't like it therefore it must die, but that its behavior is inconsistent to all the other skills and borders on being unintentional or even exploity. Clearly, from this balance update the team has decided on it being "unintentional" rather than "skillful". Not every bug is a feature, even if you very much want it to be.
---
i still got about 100 odd left, i aint usin em no more unless its a really good fight
---
Or you just hit SoI when you can and the people who have boons get them extended and the people who don't have them are out of luck.
---
I'd imagine that's why they went with shorter duration and lower CD, so you can do that extension more frequently making the penalty for not getting your boons extended by missing a single use lower.
---
Art team people are reasonably easy to replace as long as you can keep the cohesive style of the game together.
---
Gw2 has no real definable style so this isn't much of an issue. 
---
Still better than a shitty DPS player in raids. At least you're giving the other squad members 100 or 200 power+100 precision/ferocity/condi damage. That's 4000 passive stat points for them.
---
And in fractals warriors do the major part of CC. I can't imagine the shitshow without CC warriors.
---
Different story for highly optimized speedclear groups probably, but if you have to ask here this will probably not concern you (just like the majority of players).
---
and nah, just make them perma finishers and give it back to those who ran out
---
Rampage.
---
Still playable as dps in pve with good boon removal and banners, can still be used in roaming wvw and hammer spb for cc and bubble in zergs. overshadowed by other op builds in pvp but as these builds are brought down warrior will be more and more viable.
---
Oh well, ANet fight against math continues.
---
People ignoring the fact that Druids push on SH &amp; KC, Kite on Dhuum, Spirit Res buttons on Xera, immobilize on Gors if dont split etc etc. We already have active gameplay through the boss specific mechanics that druids are in charge of. And too top it all off people are under the impression that Druid mains are happy with druid being the only 10 man might bot, when every single druid I know wishes they could play other healers more and this is going to be even more true when these annoying changes go through
---
maybe all those people who left were actually Chrono mains
---
This is what happens when they let the game become "do X as fast as possible" rather than "see if you can do X at all"
---
That may be true, but in the past they never explicitly stated it was okay and recently they did, that was my point. Before that some people refused to risk it.
---
Ok, but someone explain this to me. They nerf SoI again, and even put a comment that it's still to strong.
---
At the same time, Sand Squad does the exact same thing, affects 10 people without needing a trait, is a blast finisher, gives protection to allies and magnetic aura to tempest, and it's a *weapon skill*.
---
????
---
You can't just assume without knowing absolutely anything that they were losses.
---
When we talk about meta in PvP, we talk about competitive play - ie ATs.
---
Why is this?
---
Because you can be effective on anything in ranked providing you are a good player. Additionally, you don't really build a comp, thus there is not a meta (optimum) setup for ranked.
---
You are correct though that holo is a very strong solo carry class, but at higher levels of ranked its easily outmatched by chrono/mirage, revs that know how to rotate, etc.
---
Ranger spirits can currently be healed. That's nothing new.
---
Yeah, I highly doubt we're getting another expansion at least.
---
&gt; I still don't get why SoI wasn't just changed to only share Alacrity and Quickness, but hey.
---
Because SoI is a base mesmer skill, and alacrity is very limited unless you have chronomancer slotted. Regardless of how much this might make sense, it would be bad design to make a utility available to all mesmers gimped unless you're specifically a chronomancer.
---
I am *completely* ready for GW3.
---
Chrono buffs? Why? It's been the most dominate PvE class for 3 years now? I've never seen a balance team favor a class more in any other game. It's ridiculous and looks like the people who quit the game because of Chronomancer's dominance aren't returning to the game any time soon.
---
I love the Spirit and Banner changes. They both take 2 very strong skill types (for PvE purposes) that were extremely boring to use and attempt to make them fun, while also nerfing their efficacy. I still think Banners are too strong even at 100 stats, but it's nice to see them at least acknowledging that they've been overpowered for 6 years straight. The only thing I'm not in favor of is the buff to the banner trait (funny name btw). This trait is already "required" to get good DPS on warrior PvE builds and this change is only forcing it down our throats even further, which makes Banners even more forced upon Warrior players, even those attempting DPS builds. 
---
The Tempest changes are awesome and are really exciting for WvW and Raids. Tempest lacks any kind of condi cleanse for their allies when not running the Fire trait line, so giving a team-wide cleanse to the elite spec itself is a great idea. The boons being added to the shouts make sense, even if it is a little typical. It's a boring change, but an impactful one nonetheless when it comes to supporting in large groups. I still think the Tempest trait line itself needs some trait shuffling to make it less dependent on core traits.
---
Overall this balance patch is really aimed towards PvE, although the nerfs to Spellbreaker and Scourge will hopefully make WvW zerg fights less monotonous. It still seems way too easy to just stack the same few classes in WvW and be more effective than a zerg with tons of variety. Maybe that's something they could address in future patches. As for PvP, I hope the Mirage nerf really makes a difference. Mirage is way too heavy on the CC, mobility, and burst for how hard it is to kill. 
---
Play firegrenade and done. 
---
They never did that
---
More better than technology based trash, hopefully gyros see a better future with this, it was so necessary.
---
No, I've certainly shared your sentiments this entire time. I didn't read as much into the part about them placing blame, so that's a new take for me. But I did read it is a hollow and rather pointless response completely ignoring the fact that this could have been at least mildly averted. Someone made the decision to overreach and abandon the game and franchise who they are, and now that the consequences are being met they're brushing it off as bad luck and something other than a poor decision. And whether the game continues with its lively 3-4-5 however many month cadence with quarterly... balance patches, it was really starting to feel like a downward momentum down a very rocky slope. Is it harsh? Sure, but I'm harsh because I know they can do better. I've seen them do better. I'm not even criticizing them because we aren't getting content as regularly as we used to, I'm criticizing them because we aren't getting the amount of content we could have been or the fully fleshed out content we could have been had they not left the delivery up to small teams and steered so much focus to projects that we now will never even see.

Obviously, there's only so much he can really say at this point for various reasons. But I think there's more inferred from what isn't addressed than what is. And I believe some of that consists of, "living story updates with limited resources were all we were willing to put into this game" and "you'll still get the content we mentioned but we'll probably delay it but announce a new release cadence of 5 to 6 months due to the layoffs and restructuring." At least he took the time to promote the idea that they will "try" to stay on track with releases. 
---
And I suppose, he did acknowledge another thing we already knew but had to find out from a former employee on twitter and another highly valued veteran developer in an appreciatingly inciteful twitch stream, that they lost focus. But as you said, when did you lose this focus? Why did you lose this focus? How can you constantly preach about emphasis on quality, and simultaneously admit that it lost focus? It's like getting a beautifully gift wrapped cardboard box, that has a pair of socks in it. Sure, the gift was wrapped beautifully, but now that it's open you're left with something that's practical but you spent so much time and money on the wrapping that instead of giving the person a watch or a purse, all you could afford was one pair of socks. Obviously, you need the socks and you're super glad to have them, but are you really going to be as excited about it as you are a fancy watch or a that purse you've been eying for months? I'm not great at analogies, but I think I got my point across. 
---
When we discuss a scenario we take ideal situations not band aid situation when your comp is falling apart. In ideal situation 3/5 wells are never needed was my comment. If you have anything to comment then do it with regards to this.
---
Coming next balance patch: using SOI grants 0.75s boon duration extension instead of 3 seconds. Don't go spending all them boons at once now!
---
You've got Black Desert for good combat, world bosses, and something approaching WvW...but it's also a fetid swamp of pay to win monetization.
---
Wrong. So wrong.
---
Banners were EXTREMELY overpowered in raids for such a long time, and they'll still be good even with a 70 stat reduction. Banner nerf is LOOOONG overdue, but this change is likely just going to make playing BannerSlave extremely monotonous since now you have to remember to pick up the banner every minute. Not exactly fun or exciting gameplay.
---
Whatever, I'll still continue to be the DPS Berserker hipster who never uses banners where I can get away with it.
---
Well, you don't *carry* them anymore, you click and despawn them, regaining the ability to place them again immediately.
---
Right in the feels man, you solo carry your raid party but the first time you make a mistake, the whole squad blames you
---
Engi and Ele are very similar.
---
Core ele and Core engi are both the more versatility-oriented of the core classes, introducing a lot of weapon-bar swapping that other classes don't have.
---
Tempest and Scrapper are both PBAoE boon support/healing classes now. 
---
Weaver and Holosmith are both mobile, high-risk, multi-hitter damage classes.
---
Magic vs Tech, but they are of the same gameplay theme. In all cases, elementalist has more damage and engineer has more CC. 
---
Chill and Rise see more use in PvP/WvW but in PvE the Flesh Golem, Shade, and Bone Fiend+Well is pretty much best dps/CC combo
---
As someone who has 2k hours on warrior and has been forced beyond my will to run banners in every given PvE instanced content for the last 6 years... good fucking riddance I hope they're dead. Nerf them more. Delete them.
---
Is these boon uptime calculated without combos?
---
Yeah I still remember getting my first gold. Probably like level..40-50?
---
Now you get a gold before you even leave starter zone
---
Fuck Spellbreaker we're going BERSERK
---
Let the fire rain ( ͡◉ ͜ʖ ͡◉)
---
If anything I would think it would be the opposite. Then again, if the layoffs affected the teams that were working on those episodes then I could definitely see Episode 1 and 2 of Season 5 being delayed. But you'd think Episode 6 would be far enough along that it would be a lot easier finish without any major delays. I do hope nowbody working on Season 5 episode 1 left though, because they always manage to put out some extremely strong content in comparison to the others. 
---
Then I guess yes, if by "anywhere" you mean "when everything is going smoothly", then most defensive skills are never used.
---
I presume they will gradually go the route of "no skipping aftercasts, no cancelling animation" etc. Warrior "you have to cancel axe swing" and guardian's "symbol aftercast move to cancel" could be next. Would make rotations a bit more user-friendly but also nukes opening burst from high orbit.
---
Just be like me and not run them and have fun instead :^)
---
When was this patch? 
---
If theres something i've learned over the last what, 6 years? Is that ANET never learns from mistakes and ignores the community almost has hard as any dev i've seen outside of maybe EA
---
Invasive nerfs to the arguably most complex class in the game, the existence of alacrity ren and quickbrand tell me the "direction" we're taking is not the one you think it is. I didn't think they were gonna create easy to play 10man buffmonsters either, yet here we are.
---
You would only need to pick up the banners if you want to relocate them.  Which is something you do today, except today you have to carry them to the new location.
---
With alacrity banners have a 60s uptime and a 64s CD.  If you don't pick them up, the last pulse of the banner boon should still be on people by the time you finish re-casting them.
---
If you need to move the banners.  You just pick them up and (assuming they've been down for at least 16s), you can immediately recast them at the new location.
---
I'm super hyped about this just as a concept. I love that ANet has the balls to do this. Same with the trait that changes scepter 3 to be an AoE corrupt. They're not afraid to totally alter the shroud mechanic that the elite spec is already totally altering. We'll have to see the numbers at release, but this is just so cool to me.
---
And yeah, there's lots of interesting play/counterplay I can see. You can pop this and then summon the shade like CaptainUnusual said or you could run dagger mainhand and immob them before it pops. Or just bait out dodges and use it when their endurance is drained. It adds so many potential dynamics. You see a scourge pop harbinger and wind up a big attack. Do you dodge their attack now or do you eat that damage so you have a dodge to spend when the shroud explodes? I'm really surprised fewer people are talking about this.
---
I didnt miss it. I just dont believe there will be a positive outcome for a 7 year old mmo run by a company who just lost 33% of their work force and god knows how much budget was being cut by ncsoft for further development.
---
OH MY GOD SCRAPPER REWORK IT'S HAPPENING
---
Looks definitely interesting! Do you consider this a support build or a hybrid build with some offensive. I'd really like to play Tempest as support and I'm excited to see other builds that I can use instead of the one on Snow Crows. 
---
I am quite unhappy with these changes. Mirrage/Soulbeat nerfs are fine, but the fact that nothing was done and probably won't be done anything soon to Warrior's PvP sustain or fun and interactive 75%hp instant regen from Engi kinda demotivates me.
---
Also there were no significant changes to Ranger and Warrior in terms of PvP. Not like those classes don't have their problems that at all should be addressed. While I am happy for those new PvE changes I feel like more could be done in such a long time. 
---
I was hyped for GW2 back then and i would welcome GW3 now.
---
One day we shall have more than one viable support in pvp!
---
So we don't get any changes that matter while changing something in class so people won't complain that nothing has been done to the class. What don't you understand?
---
I dunno, her facial expression to me looked like she was annoyed... it just seemed odd.
---
I'm probably wasting my time, but some points to consider.  Banner changes reduce everyone's DPS to some degree, but they hit most power builds harder than most condi builds.
---
Additionally, having lower damage across the board means that the burst windows get longer, which reduces the benefit of power builds over condi builds (and low burst power builds like Rev and Spellbreaker) even further.
---
Condi Firebrand, Condi Soulbeast and Condi Scourge are all seeing buffs with these changes (VoJ passive and Torch 5, Torch 5 and Torch Trait, Dagger 5) which should bring them closer to the current top tier condi specs.
---
&gt;I wish it was nerfed on its damage or some other metric.
---
Actually it was! Power chrono (dps slot variety) is d e d now. 
---
I wonder why you'd quit voluntarily if there's no severance package in it.
---
That's not entirely true. I live in Nebraska of all places and work for a startup (\~180 people) that's a webhost using kubernetes, golang, Ruby, and several other "bleeding edge" tech (I'm not sure people really know the difference between "bleeding edge" and "Latest stable", but that's getting off topic).
---
We do occasionally, have some issues finding people, but it's more that there aren't enough people with the skill sets we need rather than a lack of tech.
---
Low-cost places like Oklahoma are low-cost for a reason. 
---
• Their range has been reduced from 1000 to 600
---
• Their health decays over time
---
So now Druids need to be mindful of spirit health and positioning as well, on top of juggling all the other things that a Druid already do. Definitely gonna feel it. 
---
Those gyro changes to fields around the engi are very good. Gyros where pretty fucked up since pof powercreep and basically dead by splash dmg within seconds.
---
Wait... no nerfs to warrior's Rampage? wth? How interactive is that, that he gets  skills that can either CC you or deal 6k damage while  having pulsing stability, damage taken reduction? You basically have to keep running away IF you even manage to do so, because of how mobile he still is during this form. 
---
Is there noone competent left in PvP team? How out of touch one must be to do NOTHING about this skill for next 1/4 year?
---
I only use it in raids and the more useless it gets the better. Let it go... 
---
You know what isn't fun tho? Getting kicked out of pugs just because the class you play. 
---
While I think GW2 would have issues translating to a controller, I don't think the performance of the consoles can be argued against. All 3 consoles this generation are largely using standardized hardware and software (with a few exceptions).
---
PS4 and XBone are both PCs (x86\_64) with Sony's being BSD-based and XBone being (obviously) Windows-based. The Switch is a pretty standardized Linux-based ARM build using an NVidia Tegra GFX chip. Even in the GFX API area, only Sony uses a non-standard, Console-only API. Nintendo uses Vulkan and XBone uses DX11/12. Sure they are a bit underpowered compared to PCs, but they are also optimized at the OS level to pretty much only run games.
---
With GW2 being a 7 year-old game, I highly doubt porting it would be an issue from a performance standpoint, but more that they'd have to create translation layers for the GW2 engine to work on Sony's GFX API, DX11/12, and/or Vulkan (Switch is running games newer than GW2 just fine, it could easily run GW2, storage would be the larger issue here).
---
The biggest trick to function gyro is being aware of the health bar and cds of your teammates, as well as their potential to go down.
---
In GvGs if I see one my necros out of position with the enemy group turning to focus them I start positioning myself to stealth and then res with gyro. It nearly always works. Sure this isnt a solution to something that actually is relatively clunky, but you can work around it.
---
Stealth gyro like all gyros aside from function are becoming non-targetable, and follow your movements exactly. Just like the Medic Gyro Toolbelt skill. The wording of your comment made it seem like you were maybe unsure of this, so just wanted to clarify that.
---
You just described viable instead of meta. Meta is the best pick period and holo wasn't anymore since last balance patch.
---
It's almost as if, almost, no one at ANet ever played even a single other MMORPG so they wouldn't know how buff/debuff systems usually work. 
---
And mind you, at this point I feel DAoC's concentration infinite duration system would be best.  
---
Your buffs are single target, last forever, but you have a limited resources through which you can keep up only a certain amount of them. Since we genuinely have the stat concentration here, it could simply give more of that resource.
---
&gt; Just run a 100% BD Diviner's (or Harrier/Minstrel/Commanders). Never have to change build. 
---
I play half Diviner's, half Berserker's and it doesn't feel any different from running fill Berserker's except my wells last nearly ten seconds each. I don't even change gear between modes of play. It's not min-maxed but it works.
---
I think part of the chrono rage is that the idea of it tanking hasn't shifted - it no longer has to due to having high toughness by default and pretty much has Diviner's gear customer made off it. 
---
What are you talking about even?
---
I hate to bring it up, but this... this so much. I work as an "Intermediate Infrastructure Engineer" at a tech company (not even senior) and I am quite expensive in the middle of the US where cost of living and pay tends to be lower. A Senior GameDev or even Senior Lead/Director are going to be very expensive (I.E. 6 digits), ESPECIALLY on the west coast where the cost of living is so much higher.
---
It sucks, but they were always going to trim some of the longer tenured and more experienced employees simply because they couldn't "afford" them anymore. Even if a CEO took a pay cut, it would take more than I'm guessing MO makes to prevent half these firings simply based on my experience of the cost of Devs/Admins/Engineers (Granted this doesn't account for the fact the GameDevs tend to get paid less than their Software/Web/Automation/Backend/Full-Stack/&lt;insert\_title&gt; counterparts).
---
Even if it’s for two yrs, it’s still a game worth playing. Soo enjoy XD 
---
Exactly what I was thinking. This makes banners **worse**, unbelievable as that sounds on paper 😱
---
Teq gives 2 gold as a reward, as does doing three dailies but mostly no. 
---
&gt; and isn't overpowered
---
You said it yourself that with it patched out power chrono is as good as dead. You gotta have to reconsider one of these statements, can't have it both ways.
---
&gt; weapon stowing
---
Funny that you mention this, because stowing is another stupidity I want out of this game. It's an abuse of a feature that wasn't designed for that. It's not something 99% of players will figure out on their own and therefore cannot be considered intentional. Sane players won't ever bother with stowing, only those that are hellbent on pushing out every ounce of dps by any means necessary, and this kind of player I couldn't give less fucks about.
---
Good. Weapon stowing abuse needs to die. It's not an intentional mechanic, not by any stretch of imagination.
---
Keep in mind the amount of cc there is in wvsw, unless I missed something about evading while casting, doubt any bubble will be seen
---
It's so silly that this happens every patch.
---
It serves to highlight just **how** little anyone at ANet dares to significantly rework systems and maybe overhaul how boons and conditions work at a basic level so they can finally have a proper, raid usable, buff system.
---
Because banners are broken despite being one of Warrior's only viable fractal builds.

Isn't it more like 22%? from 255 to 200. At least if you went core warrior for CC and discipline.
---
My biggest issue I have with it is in large scale WvW where people tend to not be easily targetable.  Either it is a really large squad, or they're not in my squad. 
---
Almost my entire issue is actually selecting the player I want it to target out of the large group of people, 9/10 it selects either nothing, or something other than the player I'm trying to select.
---
If I'm playing in a small group, it usually isn't a huge problem.
---
I was indicating that the stealth gyro was terrible at following, and I was hoping that they would fix that with this gyro fix.  
---
I mean.. you *could* just say he sparkles.
---
the solution is: play on power bosses a weird healer like a boonspam-heal-herald and bring a power SB for frostspirit
---
Nope. The idea of the invisibility is to, well, be invisible. It kind of blows your cover if you are invisible, but the gyro that is always right above your head isn't, don't you think?
---
They literally just nerfed the ability to apply really long duration stealth in wvw, I doubt they would make a staple in the class.
---
It IS possible something like that could be the class mechanic of Thief's next elite spec, but it would probably need to be a nerfed version of stealth. It would need to be carefully balanced to be both useful in pve but not broken in pvp. Or they could just balance the mechanic differently between modes.
---
it's 170 to 100 for everyone else.
---
I can tell you that the Scrapper gyro rework is just as amazing as it sounds:-P
---
I will be there thank you! 
---
I mean they kinda killed the one thing they had in pve and wvw. Seems dead tbh 
---
&gt;low damage
---
Yea okay you're playing guardian wrong.
---
Except the actual changes are laughable. 
---
If you get kicked out because you were a guardian you have bigger issues that isn't your class.
---
That was my first thought too. Great minds.
---
Basically anything except conditions
---
That's nice that's how it works in your country, that's not how it works here in the US (or at least in Washington state). You can be terminated with zero severance regardless of how long you stayed at the company.
---
its kind of doesnt matter what they release, as there's literally no advertisement. playing gw2 since launch and never saw any ads
---
Yeah, that's why I say they should go back to certain maps for the story. For example they could have used Sun's Refuge like they did with the Dragon Lab in Season 3: an established operation base to which we go back now and then. They don't necessarily have to do less maps, just reuse them better. Because new map content is also important to satisfy some parts of the player base.
---
Better job offers at other companies, a sense of agency (being able to leave the company on your own terms).
---
Keep in mind, most of the people who work on video games do not normally get severance packages anyway.
---
Thank you :-)
---
It's for killing the WvW noobs that don't know to move out of red circles that will be flooding the mode on Tuesday.  
---
Other than that, it's completely useless as everyone knows to get the fuck outta dodge when a shade gets dropped.
---
I was always imagined chrono being fun so I spent a long time trying to gear it. Than I played it and hated it. I can only imagine how bad it must be to play it all the time.
---
I remember that. Good times.
---
And they don't pulse boons anymore. They give a few seconds of their boon when you do their active, then that's it.
---
I made it intentional to be critical capped with that passive in mind, or for that matter all the passives combined. Therefore I lost 25% critical change with this nerf. To aquire the criti cap back I would need to exchange other stats partially, which would decrease my survivability.
---
&gt; Conjure Frost Bow: Changed the name of the item summoned by this skill from "ice bow" to "frost bow."
---
This is an unconscionable insult! It's absolutely preposterous! You have some nerve, ArenaNet 🤬
---
[Standard DPS guardian would still have 50% crit chance with full berserker's gear](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNAR7dnkICFChddCWBBkdil4BTe/1/WgWlg8VkqKA0AqXA-jBBXgA9q/As/o87RJYouBA-e)
---
Then you have Radiant Power which gives 10% more crit against burning foes (almost always in any group comp), 20% from fury, 25% from Righteous Instincts.
---
Then you have Spotter and banners, or god forbid you take some assassin's stats.
---
Tell me how much this really "massacred" your class.
---
This guy makes the same mistake that others made earlier here: using sales numbers to talk about profitability. And comparing "all of mobile games" to single non-mobile games, common. This is just a lot of reddit-level talk on audio instead of written down.
---
Druid will be able to maintain prema fury atleast to its sub group and most pugs play with 2 druids any way.
---
If you are with solo druid squad, warrior on other group can take the shout to maintain enough fury. 
---
(Considering squad comp remain same as before).
---
You have no rights to be doing any damage with a build like that.
---
&gt; When a spirit pulses its passive effect, it loses health equal to a percentage of its maximum health. (7.5% for nonelite spirits, 3% for elite spirits.)
---
Eh I was under the impression that they still pulse passive?
---
Can someone explained the Thief Repeater patch? For build that use only a gun in main hand, and no other weapons in off hand?
---
Never said it was unplayable 
---
I bought the collectors edition of this zine and it's excellent. Really, really well done!
---
Just one question: the CE box I received didn't have the pink tree/griffon print that's in the upper left of your photo. What is that? I wonder why I didn't get one?
---
BEST.PATCHNOTES.EVER.
---
Heaven. I love them. Even as a guard main. So many needed changes. So many things that look like they will change things and shake up the meta.
---
Even if they may not be strong enough already, I completely agree with all of the bigger changes. 
---
I think it's  time to fanboy heavily.
---
the gyro changes look interesting. there might be a reason for me to finally play scrapper again.
---
ranger spirit change looks cool too. i hated spirits when they changed, that they cant follow you. 
---
Omg I adore his smarmy smile so much! 
---
I hope that sword is not too sharp ... o-o
---
(well done)
---
kinda meh but oh well
---
nice boonbeast nerf guys....
---
Well then you are not aware that the 6520 passive stat points a warrior brought to his squad was a DPS boost that amounts to another DPS class. For free, just for being there and placing two banners.
---
(Sorry to be late here, I never check my messages) I believe the room is named something like Delcat's legacy?
---
My point is warrior is more annoying to play with high latency. Dig reddit threads deep enough and you’ll see warrior is not recommended for high latency players in high tier PvP, for example. 
---
I multi class and will only play warrior when I had to, such as a No Pain No Gain fractal and my pug have no boon rip.  
---
i'll have to disagree with most of what you've written
---
1) there's plenty of mystery in the game (what will happen next, mister E, probably a couple of others), we're just not in a mystery arc and non of the mysteries are currently relevant to the story and adding mystery for the sake of mystery is just annoying.
---
2) ppl will always gravitate to the easiest builds that are effective, the problem isn't really that the combat system isn't good but that the game is too easy for more complex builds to be worth the time and effort
---
3) i never understood this. what happened to "i want to play this game because it's fun."? why does every game need to be some sort of skinnerbox?
---
&gt; we will probably get another one, but it's going to be a while
---
This is a problem, though. "Probably" and "going to be a while" is awful PR for a game that has just been publicly hit by massive layoffs. They should have made it clear at some point that no further expansions are planned, if that was/is indeed the case. Instead, they've been avoiding that subject like the plague in a, by now, obvious attempt to string their players along. All under the guise of "we only talk about things that are ready to ship." Bull. Shit.
---
So now they have to "get back on their feet" because they've mismanaged themselves to such an extent by neglecting the ongoing development of GW2 that NCSoft bitchslapped them back into line. Besides, this is not the first time that information of how utterly incompetent Anet's management can be has come out. There's been whispers for years that they cannot get their priorities straight and are unable to formulate and then properly execute a roadmap.
---
Expansions generate revenue by a) selling the expansion itself and b) ensuing microtransactions. And I am pretty sure that's what it comes down to for NCSoft: revenue. So yeah, no expansion this year and not even any news about an expansion may actually be the beginning of the end.
---
&lt;3&lt;3&lt;3

Lol, where is the guy who told me just gear Berserker for now, you cant go wrong with Berserker gear.... :D

As someone who plays open world Mirage and T4 Druid but took a break, this patch guarantees I will never retirn to the game.

My friend's playing engineer with on HoT. He's been looking through meta builds for end games and scrapper seems to be pretty underwhelming compared to holosmith. He's worried about his end-game capability with just HoT. Does anyone who plays scrapper here has any advice? We're mainly doing PvE content
---
Have you played Chrono before?
---
&gt; in this update *and in the future*
---
 "Nature's Vengeance: This trait now reduces the passive health sacrifice from spirits by 33%. Additionally, boons granted by spirits are now applied when the spirit's active skill is used instead of being applied upon a set interval." 
---
The passive that is pulsing and consuming health is the baseline buff from the spirits like Frost adding dmg

yea those where really awesome times, you see pve people cheering on for their pvp guilds, populating end game entry portals dissing opponents and going all out nuts cheering for their team. Its like a live football match. Its like a bond within a bond. You don't see this type of reaction in gw2 unfortunately 
---
if that 10 man might would be the only reason left to bring Druid as a healer, the option to pop in a support Deadeye next to an alternative healer could become a decent alternative option.
---
if you dont like your class anymore then just stop playing it, thats what I've done with reaper. tho now it gets little dmg buff so maybe ill go back to it
---
We had a couple of exciting months with the changes to deadeye for a couple of months, and now it's back to the status quo of PvE thief not getting any meaningful changes at all
---
Scrapper was originally designed with more PvP in mind and even after some buffs it under performs in PvE. The latest changes that will go in on the 9th reworked the gyro skills but it's not enough to be close to holo (or even base engie honestly). So to answer your question, scrapper is currently only played as a very niche [second healer] (https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/scrapper/heal/) or [kiter](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/scrapper/kiting/). Base engie has a [condition DPS build](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/engineer/engineer/condition/) but it is very hard to play and I wouldn't recommend it.
---
While a viable alternative, heal herald isnt the most fun either, FB Ele Necro Scrapper(For some) are all more fun but don't have the might output needed which is the bigger issue for me. 
---
I do want to see how a Ele Herald pair is for groups that still run two healers though with the changes to ele shouts plus the raw healing output from both classes it might be a stronger duo to run if the group needs 2 heals while being able to maintain all buffs
---
Oh I gave up raiding a while ago. It stopped being fun when half of my playtime was learning a whole new build. Now I just hop on when there's a new store in chapter, and honestly, overall, I'm incredibly disengaged from the game.
---
Overload Water shares vigor to 10 since the last patch iirc.
---
Because the trait was extremely overkill.
---
We will never bow to so called Frost! Nay!
---
No expac and revenue is going to slip below Aion. No expac and they will never get back on their feet.
---
What? I didnt assume anything, just stated that "waste of time" is a sunk cost fallacy. Look it up, its a term applicable for both psychology and economics and quite important when it comes to decision making in projects... 
---
What’s your above average latency? These days I’m playing at 380ms (rural SEA internet ftl). Thank God for condi soulbeast, it’s the most forgiving class for high latencies. 
---
They prefer to not share information that can affect TP. So, there is always a chance for some changes.
---
Good god. I remember spending a solid 60+ € on my first racial t3 because I knew I would never make it by farming (back then). Nowadays you get half a legy for that much money.
---
RI nerf is insane. Why isn't it 33 percent like any other crit chance trait in the game?
---
Hard to see core Guard surviving this in PvP, it's pretty much dead now and that's another core spec that bites the dust while at the same time Holo which was already better has kept all it's damage and CC and only got a slight nerf to Stab application? And Boonbeast is pretty much still a thing?
---
Remains to be seen how significant the Mirage nerfs will be but PvP meta seemingly will remain the exact same minus core Guard. Great. 
---
They literally can't shit one out of thin air, so I don't know why you're expecting the impossible and making this the hill to die on. 
---
I never found banners fun, when the only build wanted in groups was all banner i kinda left warrior, twice.
---
I think some people forget they are customers/consumers not members of some sort of family with ANET. It is OK to express dissatisfaction.
---
&gt; Apparently most of the community is all caring, supportive and comprehensive about those who gone?
---
Most of the community are not paying costumers.
---
&gt; You sound pretty much like CEOs out there that don't give a crap about their employers and that is what cause all type of stress and issues at corporate environments.
---
Right, let me guess, from your point of view most CEO can't do their jobs right and they're only there to fire people when things go wrong, correct?
---
&gt; Such entitlement from customers is what helps to make corporate environment so toxic and unhealthy.
---
What? No, issues like what just happened where decisions by certain managers created a 1/4 hole in the company cause the toxicity, not the damn costumers.
---
&gt; Without all these dedicated and caring humans you wouldn't have your shinny and demanded product, respect for well-being comes first.
---
Let's not pretend they aren't getting paid for it, if they didn't do the job someone else would. As for respect for well-being I agree, but there are limits and certain times where a foot must be put down.

---
This means a lot more micro management wit the banners, and a lot of time spent recasting them. At this point I would honestly like their cast time reduced by quite a margin. Because casting them without quickness feels like it takes forever. And now that we need to do it every minute that's gonna grow old really fast.
---
Which means you didn't read.
---
Lol. I love it!
---
Another post asks for more mysteries in the game, well here it is! we will never know!
---
Oof. Silent scope stealth changed from 3 seconds to 1 second?! That's not even enough time to move away, in fact a skill already cast would still hit you and then the stealth would be over anyway!

---
Could anyone translate the Mirage changes to a language of someone that does not know the class at all, but was going to start running a condi mesmer roamer? Does this mean Scepter is now &gt; Axe and Ambush should be replaced with something else?
---
Technically new WvW falls into the area of GW2
---
Exhaustion is a boon?
---
I believe it was always the intention for it to be a power class. It only was considered viable as a condi class back when  reaper shroud 5+4 combo was still a thing.
---
why did most of its traits benefit condi before the rework? i dont understand why they say it's power, give it condi traits, then rework it to power after everyone uses it for condi 
---
Temp: power and condi builds
---
Weaver: power and condi builds
---
Soulbeast: power and condi builds
---
DD: power and condi builds
---
Holo: power and condi builds
---
So I don’t really see why reaper has to be either power or condi when it could just have the potential to be both?
---
Reaper always should be power. It was not due to some poore balancing but it was always supposed to be power. And since quite a time it is power. Condi reaper is only in theory somewhat viable, but not in group content. 
---
And maybe after the upcoming patch its at least going to be decent i hope. Not rly meta, but playable. 
---
I don't know, I played ren quite a bit, both diviner and harrier, and I've never struggled with keeping 90-100% uptime on all raid bosses (except extreme cases like green dhuum) . Obviously, as a dps or a healer you also have to pay attention to your other skills, but it's so painfully easy... especially compared to chrono, which is what I was getting at. About druid, it's one of those classes where you're either bad/mediocre or ok, as in you do everything you need to do, but it doesn't take a lot of intricacy to do so. All in all, I don't find either (firebrigade vs mightbot) engaging, and I see a trend of progressive streamlining and dumbing down (GoE, SoI, distort); chrono and druid are a great example, firebrigade another. I don't think the spirit change will do anything but add a small layer of annoyance, especially cause it's another nerf to boon potential from druid and ANOTHER nerf to cc. I mean, they want us to use the active, but then they go and nerf storm which has the only very good one. Like, what? Owell, dunno. When and if I come back maybe will test, and in the meantime we'll see what theorycrafters do with it. Pretty sure nothing will change.
---
I love my ice bow but I’m so glad they finally fixed the change. It bugged me so much 
---
Thanks for your reply. That sucks really. So he kinda has to get PoF if we're lookin to play endgame pve right? 
---
isnt it already a thing with diviner gear?
---
I remember my whole family pooling our gold together and sending it to each person so we could get the 200 gold achievement.
---
I did. Half the post is just about distortion.
---
Is this a Darksouls/Lordvessel(song) reference?
---
I stopped reading here haha. Was such a facepalm moment.
---
40% crit fury is good for power builds
---
Except you want to pick it up early (as it is written in the post) so you get that 60sec cooldown reduction.  That puts banner  from an 80 sec CD to a 20 sec CD.  If you pick it up after 20 seconds, you have an auto recharged skill that can be cast right away, meaning you pick up banner some time before it expires (60secs) and after the 20 second mark to get a fully recharged skill.  The times you use banners currently doesn't look like it will change.  
---
You wont see them widely used in WvW or PvP because the games are more mobile than the banner can handle, and you DEFINITELY don't want to be picking up a banner, which causes you to stop moving (unless that changes with this) in those modes where mobility = survival.  In Raids, which is the 3rd big area, you will still use them, but it will result in what I described earlier, the Drop-wait-pickup-repeat cycle.  This may be a buff to buff up time, since you can now have perma banners with 1 war, but at the cost of some DPS (through picking up the banner) to that warrior.  That's fine, but it does make it more clunky for the warriors.
---
Well, to be fair, Death Branded Shatterer and the Thunderhead Meta Events are pretty neat and replayable :) they both have unique rewards and a predictable schedule..
---
It's even worse that beyond the lack of content, the content that has been released has absolutely horrid game design. The trend towards mechanically overloaded bullet hell, with garbage visual tells, has made PVE stressful and unapproachable. It's infected fractals, raids, world bosses, even story instances. Death Branded Shatterer and Siren's Reef are particularly good examples of how chaotic and poor quality encounters have become.
---
Bubble will be huge for defence, Not so much for offence. 
---
The meta will become even worse now because warriors can move their bubble, Before a badly placed bubble could decide a fight, now that you can easily move it nobody is going to push. The pirate meta is going to be even worse. 
---
And with the main classes of pirate barely being touched. Its going to stay this way for the next year. 
---
Not being able to flank with the bubble anymore is a huge loss, as is being able to damage and defend yourself while in it. Warriors are now going to be bubble bitches and target dummies. Going to need extremely good party to keep them alive with stab and healing and support in general. 
---
&gt;It will make things in WvW more interesting
---
thats what i meant; it removes the casting warrior doing anything else and gives counterplay to disable it... but also makes it harder to actively avoid without coordination so im interested in seeing how it plays out
---
"Let me reiterate to make myself clear: I don't want distortion back. But I want that feel back."
---
Yes. But you didn't.
---
I still remember running AC with my first guild, And our ele being a machine with ice bow and fire greatsword. He carried us through everything. 
---
Fair point. Scourge isn't top tier DPS either, but it has core features which make it desirable, if not mandatory, in some encounters. Warrior needs a few ones like these.
---
Spirit shards already have alot of dumps, people just dont use them
---
Just want to settle a debate: should condi builds be avoided or on Xera, or if you get to the point where she converts condis to boons, do you have bigger problems? Because I think there's not really many reasons, since if she's converting conditions into boons, she's in shards, and then you've already messed up to begin with. 
---
I doubt fiddling with picking up banners mid fight will be worth it. With perma alacrity you'd only have about five seconds down time on the banners anyway.
---
Announcing patch notes has been a thing for almost every balance patch in the past, why are you acting like it's a revelation or am I missing something?
---
One of my friends quit entirely because of this. Imagine being a semi-active player, with every time you try to come back to the game finding you need to regear again. For a game that prides itself in no gear progression, they make up have to put up with something even worse.  
---
I really appreciate Anet taking the time and effort to do this despite the state of things. 
---
For the most part, I think we will have to wait and see how the meta shifts and representations will change in every format here onwards. 
---
However, for the life of me, **I still don't fucking get why the fuck BoonBeast still gets away scot-free.** 
---
Yeah, I'm done with the class. If you want alacrity from me, you better be willing to swap to firebrand.
---
The stat nerf was needed, passively granting 170 stats to 10 players is insane. Bannerslave is meta for a reason
---
Reaper has always been power, even just after HoT. The reason why condi reapers were a thing was because of Deathly Chill, and base condi necro was meh (unless you needed to bring Transfusion).
---
Now that Scourge is a thing, obviously it's no longer the condi spec. Don't see how Anet are flip-flopping here.
---
And you guys say devs don't listen! 
---
The projects were likely unrelated to Guild Wars.
---
Winds change sounds nice, from what I can infer it means that I'm CC fodder, as normal damage doesnt typically break channels on most skills, while CC and forced dodge rolls do. Banner changes are alright tbh, not the greatest for others in the group due to the 70 lost stats but having pretty much constant banner uptime is fairly reasonable (considering the recharge cost on current banners under alacrity still has downtime where there are no banners). Being able to not only reposition my banners but have basically a 100%CD refresh if I pick them up is pretty strong if you ask me. But holy shit that Battle Standard. Core warrior is gonna be an absolute beast now in WvW zergs. The 100% bonus (basically warrior getting 200 bonus stats instead of 100) seems like a consolation prize for bannerslaves, dont know how this would affect DPs builds (power even more unsure, condi would probably see some improvement, dont know if its a significant one though).
---
Hell yes. I absolutely love the old dungeon meta Sc/D might stacking build, and this looks like a return to it. A shame nobody will let you run it because Druid is the most overpowered class in the raiding meta.
---
Ugh, that stinks to high heaven. 
---
+ Less downtime on banners.  
---
- More time spent casting banners.  
---
- Less group stat buffs from banners.  
---
- Less personal stat buffs, even with the buffed trait equipped, for the warrior.
---
Overall quite clearly nerfed. Not sure what the point of this is. Banners aren't particularly interesting game play so I'd get ANet wanting to remove their must have status. However this makes you spend more time on banners for less reward which just seems weird when they go through all the trouble of reworking banner mechanics.
---
Warrior doesn't really have much group utility outside of banners and isn't really a very big damage dealer. If you nerf his banners and don't buff anything else, you're not making a healthy change.
---
Fun gameplay and mechanics like most other onli e games?
---
Probably leafed through old information. Bear was hated because of the aggro system in the game being wonky along with the longbow camping players it got a fairly bad rep in the era of stacking up in a corner and cleaving mobs, as longbow lacked sufficient cleave and people using Point Blank Shot to shoot mobs out of the group. Druid is highly accepted in PvE endgame.
---
The utilities are bad in itself. Tweaking numbers a bit doen't make them better.
---
Considering ToT gives Quickness and Alacrity you might not even run Mimic anymore.
---
According to my Calculation you can run 0% BD with improved Alacrity, Chronos in sync and no TW in a Double Well Setup to hold uptimes.
---
It won't. 
---
Prepatch Banner = 170 stat points to the squad, 255 to a traited Warrior (+50%)
---
Postpatch Banner = 100 stat points to the squad, 200 to a traited Warrior (+100%)
---
Not the first but yeah "constant nerf for the last few years" is just completly wrong. o.o
---
That trait only works on the Warrior himself.
---

Those livestreams have barely 2k views. Most popular ones have been Mounts and Path of fire elite specs.
---
STO is not "successful". And its not successful because they post on reddit and forums. Lets be realistic.
---
Avg. player doesnt give a damn if dev comments on random reddit posts about bugs. Hell, they dont even read patch notes. I know we are in subreddit-bubble but we have to also remember 90% of players dont browse forums or blog posts, reddit even less.
---
Most of the time when dev posts on public about bugs lot of vocal community goes "fix the bug and stop tweeting", "maybe test your patches before shipping??" and all that realistic stuff.
---
My heart reaches out to all my fellow chrono veterans in these dark times.
---
Cool, thanks for the info!
---
wonder how death perception will interact (if at all) with this.
---
It could work as you said, or it might just spawn a delayed bomb on where you are standing and any shades deployed, ignoring new shades. That would be pretty trash.
---
Yeah I was pretty sure that they should have been working on updating their game engine and start working on GW3 or a new game but the video pretty much kills all my assumptions. And is weird for me that they worked on 2 new projects and they messed up both of them. 
---
very true unfortunately. however, if you have a few people to play with and can cover all the support roles, DPS pugs generally don't seem to mind. my static often doesn't have all 10 players available and we pug the rest, and while the occasional player leaves upon seeing some weird comp we're trying (though, FB+ren is far from weird imho), most wait and see and it works out well. on bosses where players frequently leave the stack due to mechanics I find FB+ren far more reliable to give boons than chrono, because you constantly seed those boons and don't just extend them (or rather you extend nothing, because the returning player doesn't have any boons).
---
this build is probably in the same boat, if you setup your support roles with friends and just pug for some dps or independent roles like BS, it'll work great, but pugging won't be possible.
---
How much stats does the party loose?
---
She reminds me [Sanyi](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Sanyi).
---
Holy shit a reason to play scrapper 
---
Don't use Focus 5 for damage and save it as a "oh shit"  button (basically Arcane Shield but on a lower cooldown).
---
Scepter is good if you need to kite around because it has a very solid DPS already. However sword can be interesting because the symbol is an AoE blind.
---
Your biggest help to stay alive is that your burst is so high that mobs will usually die before they can be a threat. For most mobs (even big ones) you ca rush in wish GS 2+4 and traps then get out and finish whatever is still alive with Scepter.
---
Also, especially is you have some big damage skills, using the medit heal is like having and invul: If you use the heal during a big GS/trap burst nothing except 1 shots can down you.
---
Do you have some more specific examples of your troubles?
---
Best character art I've seen in this sub. 
---
I do some theory crafting calculation.
---
With this build, you could play solo chrono for quickness and renegade for alacrity. Like that :  
---
 \- chrono solo quickness (inspi/illu to get quick F5 and TW)
---
\- renegade alacrity (heal or diviner)
---
\- tempest boon mighter/fury   
---
You're renegade probably not need 100% of boon duration so you can put more zerk stat if you are diviner. If you take renegade diviner, you can grab a druid but no need for him to take might trait, he can focus on heal.
---
Since gyros are wells now, can't turrets be like that too? Just make them like banners are now, invulnerable to all damage with pulsing AoE effect.
---
My "something constructive to say" is that this is an overwhelmingly bad idea, which is why ArenaNet stopped doing it in the first place. Complex instancing just divides up the playerbase more, which is absolutely *NEVER* a good thing in *ANY* MMO, let alone GW2 which **already** divides up the playerbase among world map instances.
---
Do *you* have something constructive, or are you just going to attack me for telling you repeatedly that this ain't it?

&gt; The 100% bonus (basically warrior getting 200 bonus stats instead of 100) seems like a consolation prize for bannerslaves

It used to be 255 instead of 170.
---
Mr. Chrono wants to have a word with you.
---
Your drawing is a fresh air. The humoristic pause. The style. The view from below.

It really changes from what we are used to see here. Got my upvote. :-)

Just a thing maybe. Maybe a wink could be even better than the both eyes closed. Maybe.

Yeah, there's an old saying. "A thousand travel books aren't worth a real trip." It originally means something like "seeing a thing for yourself is better than relying on secondhand stories" but in this case, I think we can stretch it a little.
---
On-Paper Oklahoma and Actually There Oklahoma are two entirely different things. It really is not a good place, it's entirely unpleasant to live in, and the culture there isn't the most conducive to finding good talent for a game studio.
---
Really good point about social club mentality OP! Once upon a time ANET had a sister company making a game called [WildStar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WildStar_(video_game)). Its central premise, design, and marketing was centered around its "hardcore" mentality and the idea that everything that had ever been done to make the MMO genre approachable was wrong. MMO gamers and journalists praised it as the second coming of Jesus, because it was a truly hardcore experience that would let them dunk on casuals. The ultimate WoW killer.
---
WildStar had mass layoffs and went F2P literally months after release because it was garbage and nobody played it. These layoffs were about a month before the release of HOT. Game journalists, devs and Redditers alike cried about how awful it was for them to be laid off and how eager they were to hire people from a project that made almost zero dollars after seven years of development. I remember several ANET employees bragging about how happy they were to get jobs for the people who had made almost zero dollars. 
---
Suddenly, GW2's new content started becoming hardcore and unapproachable. Hardcore raiding is the great focus of HOT! Challenge modes for the 0.1% of players that finish raids and do level 100 fractals\~! Bullet hell everything! And suddenly the player base started tanking, and now ANET is doing mass layoffs themselves. Funny how that goes. 
---
It' in the description of the video: [there](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vFAQJBLhdygI0fJW0AY2AQHBWEAshYwOoI42aft12gAQo8AA-jxRFQB+6BA0O9AjUJ4L2fofq/0QlfA4EAEAIBwNdT3UgUA6OaD-e)
---
My guardian also has some valkyrie gear. Rip.
---
Thanks for the encouragement.   
---
But I am not sure if the game may even last that long.  As mentioned above, the published financial report shows that GW2 is overall not very important to NCSOft's profit margin.  
---
They could change its business model to increase revenue, e.g. with subscriptions, put it into maintenance mode to further reduce costs, or even close down Arenanet altogether, and concentrate on their more profitable Asian markets.
---
They finally made longbow good /s.
---
They need to buff that combo so ONE FB and ONE RENE can buff a whole 10 man party...maybe then people would consider it.
---
what profession are you gonna perfect now?
---
I would honestly hate that, more then current maps with almost no content on them. What I would like to see is less to no freaking hearts and a compelling map meta SW style or VB style. With some fancy loot behind it with the system from HoT, were more participation means higher chance of obtaining better loot. It doesn't need to be massive, it doesn't need to be every map of the season, but at least two out of 6 would make me want to play more after release.  I'm tired with current LW structure and the lack of the expac. I'm on a verge of quitting this game for good, because I can;t take any more disappointments. High chance is I'm not a target demographic any more as well.  
---
&gt; As someone who is really a PvE only player I am confused as hell about "This skill can no longer be used on targets behind the mesmer." That was a thing?
---
Lots of mesmer skills don't require you to be facing your target. All of the illusions, for example, require an unobstructed line of 'sight', but that can be behind you. 
---
Chrono can be replaced nowadays, especially with more and more changes making boon chrono's DPS worse and worse than diviner Renegade and power or condi quickbrand. Firebrand can also bring the few boons that aren't covered for the entire squad by *one* druid.
---
Druid, on the other hand, singlehandedly makes literally any might generation from support classes invalid. It brings unique buffs (don't give me this "a soulbeast can take spirits" stuff, groups aren't going to come together around spirit-beasts) and before *this* incoming patch also makes protection, fury, and vulnerability output completely worthless. We'll need to see numbers regarding the health management to see if it still invalidates all non-Q&amp;A boon support after the patch. This patch also nerfs the banner of discipline though, so classes are going to want Spotter more than ever.
---
ROM must be excited O_O
---
It looks like they're trying to give the Tempest something along these lines.
---
Can't wait to see more from you this patch! You always try out new and fun things!
---
&gt;Except they are not...A bit of boons in shouts, same boons everyone already has stacks and stacks off...
---
* Gale song 10 man
---
* 10 man healing skill and healing from auras
---
* 10 man rebound!
---
* 10man easy condi removal with troopers and/or fire aura-&gt;condi removal 
---
* easy 9 stacks might on 10 targets 
---
* 10 target magnetic aura on 2 different skills
---
* raidwide boon extension
---
* easy access to raidwide prot out of earth
---
* ...maybe even more
---
This is by far the most impactful Tempest support patch I've seen so far and they wrote they will expand in the future on it and you just complain. I'm having a blast as I like to raid with heal tempest.
---
The feel? What is "the feel"? That is a statement devoid of any actual information or criticism. Again, almost the entire post is about distortion and nothing else. Now, you can try and engage me in *actual conversation* or you could try and insult me with snidy remarks we both know aren't true that are designed just to antagonize me and nothing else. The fact that you stick to the latter so much really doesn't help carry your point across or show a level of maturity for an actual discussion. I am not your enemy, you do realize that?
---
Is he fighting a war against T-series too?
---
Has a very Zapp Brannigan/Zaphod Beeblebrox look and feel to it.  Love it!!!
---
Slow and steady buffs are better than meta shifting buffs followed by groundshaking nerfs. Look at our boi power reaper here, slowly getting his share of good stuff. And power soulbeast is in benchmarks as of now.
---
70 per stat per player. So theoretically 2575 stats lost for the whole squad. Not that it makes much sense to calculate it that way as some of those stats are irrelevant.
---
I have 1900 toughness, can you tank?
---
Agreed. It was something that was semi-hard to pull off and it shouldn't have been nerfed.

Chronoing has sucked so much bloody gear out, that I made it a personal mission to slot a legendary in every available spot, and those that I couldn’t, i slotted pseudo legends (fractal trinkets/bloodstone ones). STOP MAKING IT SO CHRONO HAS TO ADJUST EVERY PATCH!!!

And finally.....

MAKE RAID SQUADS HAVE SKILLS TARGET TEN PEOPLE!!!!

The banner change sounds insane for WvW, now its a battle of who can cast the banner first, the ones that want to finish or the ones that want to res.
---
If you do not want to participate that's totally fine.
---
I for my part will, not to "love a million dollar company" but for showing my respect for those individuals who worked for that company (many of them for a veeery long time).
---
Those devs managed to create a game many players are happy to get immersed in. The reasons might be different/subjective ones: An environment with a beautiful art style, the animations, the combat system, the innovative mount system, creative festivities/events, map design, JPs, the story, the community, etc.
---
All of this would not exist in its current form if it hadn't been for the devs who put their passion and efforts (and also lots of their freetime) into creating this game and designing it the way it is.
---
This event is for those who can appreciate that and want to show it in some way, which might be difficult through other channels of communication - especially as an individual.
---
This was a Reddit post.
---
Good luck landing that 3 second tell attack when i know exactly when to dodge now instead of needlessy wasting against pulses lol
---
Or maybe heal necros in their shroud? As a Druid main during the time when Reapers (and sometimes core necros) were more often seen, this is one of the most annoying things. You ar low, LET ME HEAL YOU! :(
---
&gt;Heal output of non staff tempest is still trash.
---
Have you ever heard about Frost Bow?  
---
About Vigor: when going Tempestrous Aria the Unstable Conduit is not optimal due to lack of Invigorating Torrents, letting you go with Latent Stamina; that should apply enough Vigor to party if you are not camping water for all boon extension to do the work. On yourself you should still have 100% uptime regardless, due to Pheonix.
---
I hated that interaction. I don't have the latency to reliably pull it off and it was degenerate in the first place.
---
You right. I didn't saw that. The "wink" thing is more charming. I'm watching in a wide screen now, and not from my phone. And I guess your righter than me. :-) The picture is great and a mobile or a computer screen anyway. :-p
---
I wouldn't really call Cairn, SH, Matt, and Twins a monopoly, especially when condi rene, scourge, and soulbeast were competitive alternatives
---
Well I guess we can have fun not playing gw2 for another 6 months lol. Absolute useless balance team, not a single PVE change except for boring boons. How about people wanting to have actual fun in the game? People who want to make quirky and cool builds? Nope no fun allowed, just boring +1 extra boon stack 4 u.
---
Should make stealth gyro a really nice option for dungeons now, when it's clunky movement is gone &lt;3
---
Isn't the reflect only on you? if so at worst Matthias will only get buffs from the shards you reflect on your own so that won't be too bad imo.
---
Plus unless they change it soon enough I think you're far better off playing with a boon thief on Matthias  (for any groups) that can provide you all of those boons and many more.
---
I get that Earth is better for DPS but do you think Arcane is a safer alternative for additional boon duration and that the DPS loss won't be too bad?
---
It's only 5 if you count dodging. 
---
Bannerslave is a hybrid dps/support class, without its damage potential banners wouldn´t be worth taking. And besides losing 2 utility slots, your traitlines are worse when taking EA. Do you want a Druid to do as much dps as a BS? Besides being able to heal, give 25 might, fury, spirit buffs, CC? Or a Chrono? Being able to tank, giving perma alacrity/quickness and massive boon output overall?
---
Main mystery is who is the guy in the wishing well at vabbi.
---
&gt;Get a grip.
---
Maybe understand what druid does and the overall value of spirits before commenting on the changes? I am well fucking aware of them still having their passives, I am also aware that the larger reason as to why druids will still be prominent is because of the baseline passive of Frost and Sun Spirit. However, with the change they will either continue to be completely passive gameplay with spirits (accomplishing nothing btw) losing out on the boons they generate (which come from the trait) or we will now be dealing with casting the on use which will consume a portion on the spirits health and tp them to us, which causes a few issues.

In case you were unaware since you seem to not understand the issue that druids are complaining about our heals have a 5 target cap. That means that say we want to ensure that protection is on the entire squad for a large burst of dmg coming we will have to cast the on use which TPs the spirit to us, the dmg goes out and now we have to heal. But now there's a stupid ass spirit that is draining health and risks taking the heals (which have a target cap of 5) from your sub group. This is also ignoring the fact that on a lot of fights druids backpack groups through the fight, IE Soulless Horror with pushing and the last thing I want to deal with on top of healing constantly and pushing is also now having to cast the spirit abilities. 
---
While I don't believe that this change is a positive one and I think it's another ominous road marker in the ongoing 'dumbing down' of rotations across the board -
---
It wasn't hard to do. It didn't represent high skill or quick reflexes, just knowledge of a neat trick.
---
If you have decent ping then you will never fail it once you know how it works.
---
To quote Teapot "challenging players in GW2 is a taboo". Can't have intricate class interactions and depth that plebs would be unable to grasp. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Nevermind the fun/satisfying factor of a rotation, we've known this for a long time when Anet gutted staff Ele and power Warrior's rotations among others.
---
T1: Anything goes as long as it's not deliberately bad. 
---
T2: Introduces the idea of instabilities but is mostly manageable.

T3: Running towards a brick wall and learning you need to jump if you want to over it.

T4: Running towards a brick wall and knowing when to jump.

Right, so the rest of us cannot have fun because you are not able to pull it off.
---
can also be used on some other common things such as extra daily loot on world bosses, or 2x map reward progress for every event that you finish or double activity reward.
---
Maybe some sort of special 2nd log in reward set where you unlock one item per day by playing the game for 1 hour every day, with a special prize at the end of the month (like a small amount of gems, or even old living world episode unlocks for new players)

Is there a website that tracks the population of server world since linking happened?
---
What kind of longetivity progression does Wow provide? Curious.
---
I recon sooner or later illusions will get the same treatment. These things aren't common knowledge and ist very possible that anet has not watched the hellseth video.
---
I think power chrono is in the same niche as power reaper where it should intentionally be waker than other dps that do not bring all of their own buffs coupled with baked in defensive cooldowns.
---
The way they nerf it isn't set in stone but don't disagree with getting rid of unintuitive Gameplay first.
---
Swiss tournaments: 
---
- Round 1: everyone gets assigned a random matchup
---
- Round 2: the winners play the winners, the losers play the losers
---
- Round 3: the 2-0s play each other, the 1-1s play each other, the 0-2s play each other
---
And so on and so forth. It's used when there's too many people for a round robin (where everyone plays everyone), but you don't want to do a knockout bracket. 
---
I love that people are still getting surprised or confused by this.
---
The guy is right. Oklahoma is a shithole. I spent 5 years of my life there.  The weather sucks.  The politics suck. The schools suck. There's probably more churches than people.  
---
&gt; why did most of its traits benefit condi before the rework?
---
Because back in HOT necro was by far the weakest class in PVE, it was not viable. Reaper was a gigantic flop of an elite spec, while elite specs were supposed to be overpowered to drive expansion sales. So they basically put in one OP condition-based trait as a crutch for condition necro builds.   
---
The release of scourge has made that part redundant, so it was removed. 
---
[WvWstats](https://wvwstats.com) has activity breakdowns for timezones and the full match. No way to actually get full population numbers.
---
Sure, I agree with nerfing pchrono on that basis. Before DT got buffed, it was way below top DPS classes - but it felt fitting. Now they are nerfing DT again, but in a way that has practically no actual impact - and instead they make the rotation worse as an additional nerf which is completely unnecessary.
---
Outside of the burst aspect (power build clean shard faster too for example) if Xera happened to be stuck in CC in a shard AoE (it can happen when you go back to the middle after the 1st P2 laser) then having boons on her is kinda bad but this can happen for Power build too, the most important thing is to be sure you (almost) never apply confusion on her if this can happen because you can probably live with Xera having prot/quickness for a few seconds but Retal is deadly.
---
For less experienced groups let's say it's maybe safer with 1 exception.
---
For quite some time Xera best strat was executed with Condi Scourges because epi bounce was very strong. And tbh if you want to not have to worry about shards or trash mobs I think that running only scourges as DPS could work out nice enough if you are not doing try-hard strats in p2.
---
She can't outrun the centaurs, but she can kill them.
---
Exactly. The basic advantages are that there are no knockouts, so everyone gets to play until the end of the tournament and in the end, the participants are placed more accurately relative to one another. 
---
Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament).

**Swiss-system tournament**
---
A Swiss-system tournament is a non-eliminating tournament format which features a set number of rounds of competition, but considerably fewer than in a round-robin tournament. In a Swiss tournament, each competitor (team or individual) does not play every other. Competitors meet one-to-one in each round and are paired using a set of rules designed to ensure that each competitor plays opponents with a similar running score, but not the same opponent more than once. The winner is the competitor with the highest aggregate points earned in all rounds.

Usually Swiss does not use random Matchups, but you seed the teams, so 1st seed vs 16th and so on. We can assume for us it will be kinda random.
---
Not if it's a standalone RvR game, which the OP probably meant. 
---
What do you need it for? If you run 1900 toughness you might as well tank. If the other chrono wanted to go higher then so much stats would be wasted. 
---
If you do not need maxdps you could go for gale song and, if needed, aura booncleanse and so on. Also I would use the shout heal as it's 10man too and for some bosses or when in pugs rebound can be cool. The real live scenario potential is quite huge here.
---
We just need tons of emote like FFXIV. To complete RP experiance. 
---
Logic = most = one 
---
One trait was condi based not most.
---
This means people will jump ship to other genres altogether, diminishing their return potential even more.
---
I only said one map felt dead and that was Domain of Kourna.
---
What I did say is that roughly 11 maps have been abandoned by the game creators, never to be used again.
---
The heart where you throw the ore into the train bucket on the hill in the valley near the 1st wp is basically 0 effort... but time consuming...
---
No, this is the difference between playing the game the intended way and exploiting mechanics the designers were simply not aware of, and then pretending like you're better than the rest (see: "plebs").
---
&gt; The feel? What is "the feel"?
---
He wants to see impact. Distorsion had a visible impact, like totally absorbing greens for the group on Vale Guardian. Now, with the transformation into aegis, and the fact boons are not shared but just enhanced on allies, there is no direct visual effect, to feel you have a direct impact. That's what he wants, what many chronos want. Also having a "fun" rotation, that doesn't change every two months.
---
&gt; Again, almost the entire post is about distortion and nothing else and this tiny sentence at the end doesn't change that.
---
Yet he recognized this one shouldn't come back, as it was too strong. But it's a good example to explain the associated feels.
---
&gt; Now, you can try and engage me in actual conversation
---
I already did, but you sound kinda stubborn. And this is not an insult, but a fact. And even if I was wrong on the subject, you are the one with an agressive stance here.
---
&gt; I am not your enemy, you do realize that?
---
Trying really hard to realize.
---
&gt; I swear to God, half this Reddit acts like teenagers rebelling against their parents.
---
Ad personam attacks won't help your point either.
---
It's bizarre that players pop in Chrono threads and say the changes aren't that hard to get used to, try harder, pick a different class, but those are stupid and unhelpful suggestions. The point is it's not balance if there wasn't already imbalance, and Chrono never really had that issue. Sure, the community developed a pattern of reliance on chronos, but how long have we relied on banner warriors or staff eles? If the Chrono situation really ever had been an actual problem, there are less dramatic and still effective changes that could have been made instead without crippling the spec. But that's what Anet does: cripple their own good ideas once they've succeeded.
---
[removed]
---
ArenaNet streams barely talk about new stuff though, they're just fluff. Also, the format is less than adequate, blog posts would be much more effective.
---
Why are you even comparing Warrior with other Support specs? Chrono is beyond broken and it really needs to be toned down. Btw, EA is still worth taking on bosses where Power damage is superior. And Warrior would be nothing without banners, banners are the only reason it is Meta. Warrior DPS is bad compared to other DPS classes, whereas Power Chrono and Mirage are both good.
---
\&gt;chrono rotation  
---
fucking lol, the class has been a joke rotation wise since it got nerfed a couple months ago
---
And if you have no opportunity to express your skill, then you are just a blank faced player like everyone else. Where your skill means nothing either. 
---
Plus, that shit was FUN! Have you ever seen yourself around 10k above everyone else? 16 seconds into the burst and you are still at 60k? That feels good man moment when you do pull off the trick and are rewarded immensely by it? Where is the fun now? Where the fun when all your methods of expressing your own skill has been taken away? I remember fucking distort share, I remember lesser SoI, I remember sigil of concentration, I remember all these different rotations, I remember SoE. What happened to players not wanting to be a fucking sheep amongst a flock? What happened to those players who went through all the work just to become invalidated? 
---
Where can a player really express their desire to get better with their class? To stand above the others? To not have meaningless participation trophies(low skill cap, low skill floor, low impact) sitting everywhere they go? 
---
Ele jail incoming.
---
I get that you're trying to do something nice but the name of it is misguided bordering on offensive.  It's like posting #Love4Tornados after a town gets swept off to Oz.
---
Daredevil, yes and it should be toned down. Deadeye though? Hardly. The fix for bugged Dagger Training took it below DD for single target (and it still lacks cleave, vuln, passive sustain and stolen skills and requires more positioning).
---
I can definitely agree that Daredevil needs toned down but so did power Chronomancer before these changes. 
---
Even with alacrity the situation could be fixed if alacrity was only a chrono-unique mechanic, not a boon or anything and that it could not be shared or affect any other characters. That way the theme of the specialization would be still there, yet it would not be overpowered. But I can only imagine the mass rioting from the raiding and fractal scene (not that raids even require as high dps numbers as people push for)
---
Every map I go to has a few people running around at some point, so I am not too bothered. Yet.
---
However, the absolute load of currencies is indeed getting out of hand. Right now I don't see many repercussions, because I am always "up to date", but... others aren't, and it can be confusing.#
---
And the more maps we get, the more the players hypothetically need to spread out. As I said, I don't think it's bad yet, but it might be, at some point.  
---
If they change their approach, I think it would be a good idea to cut the map amount in half, but increase the size etc. Three maps a year, six maps for two seasons. 
---
Although I must admit it feels adventurous going to a new area of the world every three months, and I am glad I was there for it. 
---
You're presenting some very one-sided subjective opinions as facts here and ignoring some very important points.
---
You're understating a lot of the cons of LS1. Far, far from everyone thought it was 'fantastic' as you put it. Most of it was low quality content you had to farm for the time it was out to get all rewards. The permanent changes to content means that instead of actually making new stuff, you just remove or permanently alter/ruin perfectly good old good content (Kessex Hills, Lion's Arch, Twilight Arbor, etc.). Updates also barely added anything longterm. Sure, we got a few fractals, a single dungeon path that was hated, but all in lesser volume than we get now. Story missions were also very uninspired and a huge step down in quality from what we have now. LS1 in the end did barely anything for the game except make people feel like they missed out, since everything good they developed for LS1 they subsequently went out of their way to remove pretty much entirely from the game (marionette, the entire attack on lions arch, nightmare tower, molten facility, need I go on?), leading to actually nothing changing unless you'd been playing for the few weeks that an update was current. It was even worse than in other MMOs where although the only relevant content is the current content, it at least isn't removed entirely from the game with nothing to show for it in return.
---
LS2 updates were frequent, but very small in scope. Most updates didn't add anything actually worth replaying either. The game just had a severe lack of actually good open world content back then. If current patches are only considered 3 hours of content by reddit, LS2 patches in comparison would be considered 10 minutes of content. It did have some good stuff like luminescent armor, but what it actually added was also not much.
---
New currencies is something I absolutely do NOT agree with that it's a con. It's great to have differing currency to make people actually play certain content for certain rewards. Look at the difference between HoT and PoF. HoT maps are still played a ton, in part because they offer exclusive rewards via their currencies. PoF maps are just maps you do once and then you're actually done with them. They severely lack long term rewards. 
---
LS3 and LS4 also aren't all bad as you seem to imply they are. The maps are still far from dead as well, they're actually the maps I revisit the most. LS3 didn't just add maps, it added many more things (Fractals, Raids, etc) and the maps themselves are a shitton more engaging than core maps have ever been. Unique masteries, interesting rewards, etc. They added a lot to the game, especially for newer players, unlike the previous 2 seasons.
---
LS4 maps are indeed much less interesting to me as well, but that's because of the direction ANet has taken with PoF. GW1 nostalgia pandering and one time experiences. Thunderhead Peaks however is one of my favourite maps in the game, I see little wrong with it or the episode.
---
I'd personally like maps to have more replayability as well via the HoT (and LS3) route. More unique currencies, larger and more rewarding meta events, more unique rewards, more focus on gameplay (some of the HoT/LS3 masteries are still fantastic and really add to the experience of the maps), less focus on one-time achievements.
---
The maps aren't the problem, the reward structure for them is. What stops me from farming volatile magic in a brainless farm like Istan, then AFK in PvP for the currency and achievement rewards for the newest episode so I can buy everything at the vendor? Why would I bother replaying a map like a PoF map when I'm only rewarded slightly for doing so a single time?
---
Banner today w/ Alacrity: 90s duration - 96s CD - effectively 100% uptime
---
Banner next week w/ Alacrity: 60s duration - 64s CD - effectively 100% uptime
---
Unless you want to reposition the banners, you still don't need to touch them.
---
This is a horrible argument. "If you don't like it, then don't play it."
---
Absolutely fabulous
---
&gt; This seems to be Anet fixing the cons of Silverwastes namely that it was just one map.
---
Except... it wasn't. You forgot about Dry Top which was added with eps 1, 2 and 4.
---
And while I agree, we have some problem with abandoned content, unless ANet changes their policy about how Living World works with Season 5, we are unlikely to see it be more cohesive in its map/world design. Namely, unless they stop being afraid to force people to buy episodes they don't own, we won't see story return to maps we already visited nor any later content updates to those maps. This could potentially be fixed with Season 2-style maps, being expanded over time with multiple episodes but since episodes take around 9 months to be produced, it's unlikely.
---
Also, most of Season 3 maps are actually still well populated.
---
LS4 has some real problems but calling it worse than LS1 is such a ridiculous stretch. LS1 was terrible and really put the game in a terrible place.
---
Yeah, and changing your gear every time the meta shifts isn't exactly cheap either.
---
The recent update to runes and sigils made it even worse.
---
I always just like to think its because our characters are just very very bad at crafting.
---
Oh boy... I see what you're saying, but you really should think about avoiding incel language if you want people to take you seriously. 
---
And all that for a gut shot at the Condi build. 
---
&gt; Why?
---
Because they just now became aware of this trick (as did you all, I don't remember hearing about this trick a single time before the last balance patch, but it was in the game ever since chrono was added in HoT) and rightfully viewed it as a bug that needs fixing. If you let this bug define your entire enjoyment out of the game, then I'm sorry, but you can only blame yourself for that.
---
apparently i had like 30~listed so some a silver for me. 
---
Alacrity is 25% cd reduction, not 50%.
---
I agree power chrono was hitting too hit, but that could have been fixed by reducing the dmg buff from danger time or increasing the dmg reduction of the trait that makes 2 phantasmal berserkers, go from 25% to 30%.
---
How does making banners basically not have any active skills and being destroyed when picked up make them less passive and give them more flexibility?
---
Is this a general chrono problem or a min max issue? Like, cant you just slap 100 boon duration on it, adjust traits and call it a day? Sincerely asking as i actually consider to chrono up.
---
Do you think a more supportive build like this could replace both the firebrand and druid? With ToT now providing 10-target quickness, a solo chrono might be able to reach ~90% quickness on 10 targets with Time Warp. Adding in the boon extension from this build might enable the firebrand to be dropped altogether.
---
I always found it funny that we have to annihilate entire forests to craft a branch
---
Sooo... What's the problem with adding new maps and "abandoning" them ?
---
"• Bulwark Gyro: This skill has been reworked. The gyro now creates a lightning field that follows the engineer while it grants them barrier every second and **redirects some damage from nearby allies to the engineer.**"
---
I'll have one fuck no to go please.
---
I still don't understand this change at all. DT was what was really kicking pChrono over the top, and it's barely touched given the crit overcap. Sad days.
---
&gt; I don't remember hearing about this trick a single time before the last balance patch,
---
That doesn't mean we didn't know about it. We knew about signets of illusions having the same interaction since HoT launched - since people used it in PvP on chrono.
---
And I have personally been releasing benchmarks using the heal signet interaction specifically for over a year now. See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HpKhvhSdPJU which was released exactly a year ago.
---
That's a JoJo pose :D
---
I didn't want to come in here and argue, because it's not a thread for. It's a post to share pictures of the upcoming event. I invite you to come and tell how much you disagree our idea in [this thread instead](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/auudcy/a_celebration_of_those_weve_lost_today/).

BUT, your wrong about EX staff. I'm sure of that. It's not a wish. It's not something i'm praying for. End of the story. Thanks a lot for showing a little bit of respect.

---
\_Warm regards
---
My \[EU\] squad will open as  intented and as promised 17:00 utc whatever happens. ;-)
---
People just don't realize how overpowered and irreplacable warrior is.
---
Yet other people have pointed out the issues with this interaction where it can be latency and hardware dependent, more so than many other rotations. I imagine Anet don't consider this to be a good design principle and is therefore trying to resolve two issues at the same time.
---
The thing is that they basically fucked banned utility for anything that isn't group PVE.
---
Banners have never really been good in PVP or WvW other than for the buff they provided when picked up (AoE speed buff, constant AoE regen). 
---
Hell, for small groups or solo open world stuff, I often used one banner with regen trait because it could fix the sustain hole that warrior still has. 
---
They basically fucked every other usage of non-elite banners for whatever reason.
---
I actually recall, I got to level 80, had about 12 gold, and felt rich.
---
Maybe even less, 100 gems was 30 silver at the time.
---
This was all about the 1st month although, jeeze the foresight I wish I had XD
---
Nope, sorry, I'm not accepting this response after hearing you repeatedly refer to other players, that aren't aware of this trick or aren't willing or capable of pulling it off, as "plebs". People that don't enjoy viewing themselves higher than others don't typically refer to others with derogatory terms.
---
It isn't the only thing. This is quite a symbolic nerf Anet gave. They don't want players to be able to improve themselves better. They just want everyone to have the same sense of pride and accomplishments. 
---
Plus they definitely knew that existed. It has been up on SC's website ever since the build gone up there. In like 5 days of learning pchrono I discovered the trick. So they just left it all these time to fuck with people who put time into learning it. 
---
 Did they just nerf the last viable core builds? Was thinking to start warrior. Which one should I go now?
---
The tornado is NCsoft. ArenaNet is the town.
---
It's called a low-effort post xD.
---
Rebound affecting ten targets isn't useful in PvE?
---
Have you ever considered this was their intention?
---
LS1 fucked up so much. To call adding a bit of content then actively removing said content and old content from the game better than adding new maps every few months just baffles me.
---
They do it often, tho. You wont always have lot to talk about (thanks to "Show dont tell" rule and outrage people have if those get delayed (alliances, anyone)).
---
Also its sort of "catch 22" - no one watches livestream therefore no one asks questions on livestream. So no one tunes in (later or live) to do questions.
---
For example. WoW does Q&amp;A livestream now. Once a major patch, so once every 6-8 months or so. Which is also lot of "corporate talk" like "Q: I dont like current grind, what do? A: We hear you. Something we talk about lot internally. Its complicated situation. Weve seen data and its probably in need of some fine-tuning at sometime in future. Oops did I say that out loud. I meant its not priority. But I mean, keep subbed pls"
---
When they were at their peak during Wrath of Lich king, they did Q&amp;A thro some clunky Livechat java-plugin and they did it maybe twice a year. And third one was reserved for Blizzcon live audience. It also had lot of fluff people got outraged about ("why do you waste time on lore when warriors are broken omfg")
---
There was no twitter, no youtube channel of any kind, blogs were just "starting out" and forum presence was rare-ish youd have fansites make frontpage news about dev posting on forums.
---
I dont even blame them. They had millions of subs and most of the posts in official forums were so cancerous they tried to make it show Real names at one point (that backfired hard). 
---
I just have little respect for people who don't want to put in effort to improve. If you don't agree with that fine. But I will never respect the lazy attitude some people have. I want to enjoy the game and improve my own skill level. So it frustrates me if the laziness of others is punishing my enjoyment.
---
Almost all the mount-related hearts ( Highjump Ranch, Sand Jackal Run, the Raptor heart in Seeker's Village, and Skimmer Ranch ) only require running around on your mount and collecting things, so zero effort. 
---
ideal conditions in pvp you still reach a 60% crit chance on valk amu. That is if you have fury (20%), retal (25%), the 5% baseline PLUS the target has at least 1 burn stack (10%). For GS core that is definitely not enough and a big damage drop-off.
---
However, going marauder amulet is an equal damage drop-off. Just to regain crit you'll lose 150 Power, 340 ferocity (a bit over 20% crit damage) and 340 vitality which eqals about 3400 HP. 
---
This is a flat nerf without compensation as the other 2 grandmaster traits are not just not good but outright memes. Especially with them getting rid of burn on block on tuesday just to buff f1 passive burn by 20% (from 2 1/2s to 3s, big whoop).
---
GS will need marauder amu, onehanded setup (sword-scepter) could still run valk with a potential 75% crit uptime (add +15% crit to the equation through trait). And after previous balance's nerf to hammer I have no idea where it's supposed to fit in now...
---
Please do not spread rumors on things you seem to have no idea about. If it is based on some news article, links to support your statements will be appreciated.
---
DOZENS!!!
---
Someone so optimistic... Gives me conniptions. 
---
Really appreciate the fact that you often put out off-meta strong pug builds! 
---
I was wondering if you were to have to switch utility skills which ones are to be switched first to lose the least amount of dps?
---
How important is Arcane brilliance? Was thinking of maybe switching it to "Wash the pain away".
---
Same for Glyph of elementals? How big of a dps loss would switching it with "Rebound"?
---
Thank you in advance and please keep on producing these helpfull videos :)!
---
HES ONE OF THE - NOT LAYEDOFF - DEVS HAHAHAHA 
---
Warrior still have a decent dps with good cc. On top of that, banners are still very very strong (and broken af on raids). Don't see any change here, still best class in raid and top tier on fractals.
---
How about comparing market earnings he did? Western market as a whole is about 10% of ncsoft's revenue, it's mostly irrelevant for them.
---
Ah, it seems I missed that part.
---
Anyone's thoughts on Nature's Vengeance? From what it looks like, taking the trait is a straight up nerf to boon output? Why would anyone want to even use the trait now?
---
What skins are you using?? I've never seen them before
---
This has been my reaction exactly since last patch and more so this patch. I still don't understand why it's being used XD (0 experience as a Mesmer)
---
Probably because of the patch notes with big buffs to Tempest aura boon support, just speculation that the rune is going to be meta or something.
---
Auramancer update next week
---
A huge distinction is that with other MMOs you only need to regear moving into future content, and that gear is produced as a reward for doing that content. There is a progression that feels natural to it.  
---
With GW2 you need to regear, involving tapping into whatever savings you had, to continue where you left off from.  
---
If only *I* could be so grossly incandescent.
---
But the biggest studios in Germany are in big cities. Off the top of my head:
---
* Blue Byte: Düsseldorf
---
* Crytek (I know, I know): Frankfurt
---
* Deck13 (I'm on the fence but the Surge was a pretty big game all things considered): Frankfurt and Hamburg
---
* InnoGames: Hamburg
---
* Yager: Berlin
---
Berlin may be an exception in that it's not as costly, but it's still a big city, and "sexy", as you quoted. You can build a studio anywhere, but big studios tend to gravitate towards big cities because it's easier to attract people there.
---
Dumb question from a relatively new raider: what's the best way to be able to see damaging raid mechanics on the ground? It seems difficult to pick out things such as, say, VG's teleport circles, among 10 people all stacked in the same spot, nameplates, and aoe circles everywhere. Is there a trick to this?
---
How is it in any way beneficial for you to suggest that fellow players take it up the Anet like you have when what they ask for would benefit you, too? It's one thing to not feel the need for more information, but to tell others to stop asking for it? What mentally inverted, backward ass kind of thinking leads one to suggesting CHOSEN ignorance???
---
I agree that it’s not funny. It should have been removed (in the form of a total rework) years ago. It keeps getting changed because they know people enjoy it and they want people to enjoy it. But it’s clearly bad for the game, they know it’s bad for the game, and it’s unfixable.

Honestly, the fact that it’s chrono mains that are salty every patch boggles my mind. It’s proof they care about you way more then they should.
---
Nur they add a Multi stomp instead 
---
"Abandoned content" is just how software development works with scarce resources and shitty managers. All the higher-ups care about is new features and content to sell, and getting it out the door as soon as possible, so you can start working on something else entirely, because why would you want to make sure the last thing you did is actually finished first?
---
People can complain and write these useless posts all day long, it makes no difference. What ANet needs to change is the people making these decisions, because obviously they have not had the best insights over the last couple years.
---
But his armor still protects his neck from being sliced.
---
it does not matter how you think about it, ncsoft DID think about it this way. as sad as it is, this is a normal buisness desicion. a project (anet) gets a budget and a target to aquire. if the target is reached, no problem and the money will flow or even gets raised (depending on the possible or already aquired outcome). if a project does not meet those goals (which is on anets managment to achieve it) funding will stop. 
---
to get this possible mistake out of the way, im not saying that its mismanagment in a fraud way. im saying the managment was failing on reaching those goals with a given budget.
---
No, it’s not. Gameplay is actually worse with alacrity, because they have to balance around it’s existance, but it’s not always accessible.
---
I play on 300ms and I've never had a problem with the interaction. Real sad it's going.
---
Cause daddy not hitting us when he gets drunk is still an improvement
---
I better hope the chainmail protects him or else his head will come off
---
True, he may be putting a lot of faith into his armorer 
---
&gt; So what do you think? I know what I think, but maybe you think differently
---
I think you should educate yourself on what a Swiss tournament is before making assumptions.
---
Eh, the only power class I definitely remember off the top of my head that had "issues" hitting 100% crit was Elementalist, as that was the only class I actually double checked the values because it seemed so close.
---
Other people with more insight into the various builds might have more info though, but I'll go through the power builds I use to have an idea how much I'd have to redo.
---
Turning effect on [effect LOD](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Options#Advanced_Settings) for one, looking for outlines and sound effects for abilities (yellow outline around your screen if in a teleport). Knowing the timing and seeing them pop up on the boss or around him. 
---
It's like a regular bracket tournament, except the instead of just the winners playing each other and the losers being eliminated, the losers play each other as well.
---
I appreciate your candor, and I'm not sure any response from me will be satisfying, honestly. I think you're clearly a passionate player who has a number of things you would wish Arenanet to have done differently or handled in a "better" way, and I think you can and should feel that way. 
---
When you say at the end "It's really hard to pinpoint what my actual problem is" - That is what I was trying to communicate to you. It's hard for EVERYONE, including us, to pinpoint, so we try our best to take in as much feedback as we can and address the trends we see coming up.
---
The scenario you described when you said  "Of course your job is hard, but if you wanna do it right, which job isn't?" is exactly my point - and I think this is where the Arenanet communication policy is admittedly part of the problem, because without a clear window into why we are doing anything, and what we are working on, it becomes a situation of us asking every player to have implicit trust that we were doing everything we can for the game we all love. And we were for *my* entire tenure at the studio, and I have faith that the team will continue to do so now and in the future, but I think for some people that lack of total transparency (i.e. the ability to SEE anything about the work that is being done) gives some players a feeling of powerlessness about helping to provide some level of guidance and feedback about where THEY want the game to go, and they're not aware that gathering feedback from the community is part of almost everyone's daily job.
---
I don't know if, in the wake of this, any of the policies will change - it was very much in favor with upper management to "surprise and delight" players, but I can certainly say now that, because I'm like this, I think not everyone is a fan of surprises.
---
Never thought I would see a Gyro re-work before build templates.
---
Pumped for my Scrapper though!
---
I'm curious what latency you play on. I play on 300ms and I can always do it, and it's not like I put a bunch of time into practicing it or anything.
---
Balancing around it has nothing to do with how the class feels to play in the end. I get where you're coming from, but what I mean is that every single class feels infinitly better to play as soon as it has alacrity buffed.
---
Makes sense, thanks for the reply!
---
It's annoying how much they are dancing around the real issue and how we have to always get the same unfun rotations to adjust every 2 months, getting in the routine of testing and reading spreadsheets. Even doing Golems alone is not viable and we have to ask ppl to just stand with us doing nothing because we have no idea of the boon uptime.
---
Just kill SoI, give boons from wells at every tick and let it be. Most of what could be done is explained in the forum post I linked.
---
It's a recurring trait from the Anet balance team. They make a change that wasnt needed, it backfires, then they nerf something that was the fun part of the kit.
---
It happened when they overbuffed SoI to the point where it was worth it to mimmic the spell for near perma uptimes of all boons. So instead of reverting the buff they nerfed mimmic and SoI, killing the fun interaction with CS that made triple casting blink or portals possible and fun.
---
Now they're nerfing SoI to the point where its only there cause there's nothing better for a boon chrono to take. 3 seconds boon extention for a 0,75 cast time? like why even bother...
---
Though I was surprised at how many startups are spawning in the Ruhr valley, Dortmund, Mülheim, Essen, Bochum, it's almost as if our structural economic policy is finally paying off. They are small now, and many will go belly up, but at least we might be getting some industry back into the Pott.
---
Not the actual message I'm sending. I want to have fun playing it and just be viable, not even the top option.
---
Like pennants ! o/
---
True, which is why we're stuck here, like with so many other things. Anet simply doesn't have the balls nor time  to just remove it and balance from there again, with their balance track record of time passed in between patches it'd take way too long.
---
We're basically agreeing here anyways, we're just looking at the problem from different directions.
---
Came here for the title, love the picture.
---
Lol, I think that's a pretty bad take on this. This is clearly a deliberate change to try and offer the playerbase more options for that brand of support, seeing as Chrono has completely outclassed every other spec since Chrono came into the game.
---
Sadly true.
---
The only real way to balance mesmer is to redesign it from the ground up.
---
Ah, I just assumed since Anet mentioned healing spirits in the notes that this was something new, my bad. Still, this has me frustrated:
---
&gt;In exchange, spirits **no longer have preset time durations for how long they can stay alive** and instead lose health as they passively enhance allies. This is **intended to provide a more dynamic gameplay experience** than their current cast-on-recharge functionality. Of course, spirits can still be used in this manner, but **proper use of the ranger's healing skills** and more powerful active skills to reposition and attack with the spirits will yield stronger results.
---
I don't know, maybe it's just me, but it seems like being able to heal Necro minions also "provides a more dynamic gameplay experience" and is a "proper use of ranger's healing skills". &gt;:(
---
Sigh. Don't mind me, I'm just forever salty about Anet killing Reaper's condi minion master build in the glory days of post-HoT. I miss my army of undead flesh nuggets at my feet. &lt;/3
---
No, most of that post is whining about distortion, which, while it was super fun, was broken as hell and rightfully nerfed. Except he doesn't want it back, he wants "the feel" back. Yeah, very constructive.
---
What you are saying is absolutely correct and I am so annoyed with anet at the moment (as a chronomain since beta of HoT) that for now I am taking a step back from raiding for the first time. BUT this patch barely affects anything. The rotations wont change much and neither will the gear. At most mimic might die because of the ToT change. 
---
The outrage is well founded. But what triggered it? Meh. This should have happened last patch when SoI was utterly gutted.
---
Some living story heart where you need map currency
---
I think season 2 is my favourite story-wise because it takes things slow and doesnt rush the story to killing villains so insanely fast.
---
Which is fine... in WvW. But somehow anet is pretending we want defensive buffs in raids? :/
---
Simple.
---
Power FB with a couple pieces of diviners.
---
The DPS output of the group is actually higher (just have a soul beast provide a spirit)
---
It requires more coordination however.
---
Small startups can have it easier, sure, because they only need to reach an agreement between 10 people tops to live there. But when you're a AAA developper trying to attract over 100 people to work there, it's common denominator time
---
They work and provide higher dps.
---
But also require allot more coordination.
---
Right, we'll see.
---
In many raid bosses, you have small windows of downtime you can use to adjust banners, so there might be less of a DPS loss than you think if you know the timings of the encounters somewhat.
---
The nerf is probably warranted, but it will cause a rejiggling of some power builds, though I'm not sure which ones are actually impacted. I'll go through the ones I personally use to prepare, but I feel that most builds overcap anyways, especially because I never went off the Trufflesteak food (+100 Power, +70 Precision), so I fill that nerf as is.
---
As for the BS builds, Condi didn't always take the banner trait anyways, as there is a viable option without the discipline line, but I'm relatively new to Condi BS so there are probably reasons why there were two builds. Eh. As for Power BS, you are right that it wasn't a DPS class (though again, Condi Warrior works as DPS just fine) so maybe I'm a bit more nonchalant about this, but *because* you are an utility class, losing a bit of DPS doesn't hit as hard IMO.
---
 It depends on how much group DPS will get vaporised with that change, but 100 stats for free is still enough to have a guaranteed spot, and the actual DPS requirement to beat a boss gets beaten multiple times over anyways.
---
Couldn't have said it better, thanks for expressing the feelings of many other pChronos.
---
Rev is king of raw healing. Its just much harder to play.
---
Tempest is king of high performance while being easy to play.
---
true shot 1500 range.... oh and now longbow is usef.... is still shitty asf...
---
Don't bully Shatterstone. It's already on the watchlist.
---
Using the Skull Masque. Cloest I could find. And using the Orchestral Greatsword.
---
Draconis Mons JP.  It's **quick**, you'll get one level 80 rare even on a bag opener for ecto, and a daily dose of fire orchids. 
---
Hey, I'll _take that_ !!
---
its not a WoW clone like they do things very differently but yeah most GW1 players didnt feel the connection to GW2.
---
alot of cool mechanics and designs in GW1 just seemed to vanish and while GW2 does some amazing things with new mechanics things like dual classes which opened up 10x the customisation you had to GW2's systems for a lot was just disapointing.
---
the loot i would also say in some ways was more akin to an ARPG's and for alot of people GW1 was this inbetween game of an ARPG/MMO
---
its a shame they did move away so much but again i love GW2 for what it is but it still doesnt quite feel like a true sequel to myself and many others.
---
I was not offended. That wasn't even in the top 100 things I have to read each that that even make me lift a brow. 
---
That depends on the instabilities and if you use all 3 potions T4 is way smoother then T3
---
I don't really care about top tier DPS, the hardest stuff I've done is some dungeons together with a friend and HoT. Not going to do raids or so.
---
I tested my power chrono (non-meta build) and got only 6.5k DPS without any extra boons against a golem.
---
Absolutely! Mind, the thread will give them a big head. *piles more work on*
---
higher floor, lower ceiling, less skill needed
---
Why does the upvote percentage on something that doesn't really paint the game in a positive light proof of fanboys?
---
I've let him know! 
---
(We used to play in the APA together.)
---
&gt; Season 1: It was a mess.
---
Yep. Take off the rose colored glasses and season 1 was a huge pain in the ass with lots of people missing much of the story even if they were "current" players.
---
They are amazing, but sadly rarity. They are praised for reason
---
Except you don't have to take any of this if you have a skilled team and aren't going for a speed run. That was the point, I think. The Meta will always say "you must take x, y, z".
---
But it scaled with boon duration, so 6 seconds at 100% BD, unlike the current version that is unaffected  by the stat.
---
I checked with the "gw2 tools"-App and apparently I need 5250 Elder Wood Logs... About 500 blood veils of various types, Bones and Claws aswell... Just to make one branch of wood... I would be done with this if nevermore wasn't as pretty.
---
"Dodge" duration applies everywhere, signet slight change, basically everything is now "only castable in front" (really bad idea with random positioning), and "Cry of Pain: The number of confusion stacks that this trait allows Cry of Frustration to apply has been decreased from 2 to 1 in all game modes.".
---
But distortion was fairly hidden too? Frankly nothing has changed about the way I distort most bosses and neither has the obvious backlash if I fail? I still don't get that point.
---
My big issue is one of hidden info though, yes. You are extending boons you cant even see, which is ridiculous.
---
You're thoughts are exactly my thoughts and applies even to WvW.  I mained chrono especially for WvW. Keeping track of your internal cds for SOI and also group distortion was crucial to major zerg fights and in gvgs. 
---
And who exactly are you to tell people how to express what they feel ? Of course we do this to make us feel better and if you have an issue with it, too bad.   
---
I was around for LS1, you know what I remember? Not a whole lot, and if it weren't for my Karka 20 slot bag I wouldn't ever think about it again. Something that happened once in a game ~7 years ago is not memorable to me, and if I were the type to hold nostalgia for it, I can't even go back and replay it? Abandoned maps sucks, but at least I can go visit them.
---
But there isn't that in GW2 honestly, it's watered down to a level where you can do any content eyes closed.
---
I guess if they cannot admit they made a mistake and reverting and going in a new direction is impossible, then yeah. 
---
though I'd say the underlying problem with chrono has been CS for a long time. I don't want to lose it as it's such a unique mechanic, but it is by far the biggest contributor to the whole SoI OP mess (combined with in-split mimic etc). any boon duration change gets compounded due to the recasting in and out of split and naturally gets hard to balance. moving SoI away from boon interactions would mean we'd run 2 (buffed) wells, and suddenly had an open utility slot, which was always kind of the staple of mesmer: having useful utility for every situation, but chrono rarely had that luxury in the last few months.
---
if they had a clear vision of what a support chrono should be capable of doing, it might be easier to find solutions, but at this point, I highly doubt they have any idea where they wanna go, they just try and change symptoms without addressing the underlying issues themselves.
---
Maybe my footage makes it look a little clunky because I dont upload in 60 frames and it occasionally lags (video editor issue) but the class plays absolutely fluid, especially if you learn all the combos ;) 
---
Power Reaper gives you, personally, a lot of utility.  You have big hits, CC, debuffs, and an HP bar that is the best in the game.  You do have a place in a group, but the Reaper/Necro is a fairly selfish class, other than debuffs.  
---
I can solo non-PoF Champs without much of a problem, so the damage is fine.  The biggest issue I have with it is that it is ssslllloooowwww in moving around the world, by comparison to almost every other class.  
---
&gt;More overpowered then giving 10 people every buff in the game on command?
---
Detonate plasma? Not available most of the time, and you have to build around it to make the uptime permanent. Still too strong, but banners were better. Also there were other sources of those boons, they don't really stack in effect (besides might). Banners are unique and stack with every other buff in the game.
---
&gt;More overpowered than having a placeable pulsing aoe that gives foes every condition in the game
---
"Every condition in the game" is a lot less meaningful in PvE than in PvP or WvW. It's damage is high, but not particularly egregious.
---
&gt;More overpowered than the constant torment spam of mirage?
---
Not a single skill.
---
&gt;More overpowered than ressing 10 people from downed?
---
5 people actually, and yeah that's situational as fuck.
---
Your examples are pretty bad. Banners are way stronger than any of those individually. The range is large enough to not be a concern. The immobility is... not true at all, you can (and should) move them as necessary. The stat gain is immense, you can have 100% uptime easily, they take all of 2-3 seconds to place every minute and a half, and require no further input.
---
It is possible, though it would be extremely tight and reliant on Shield 5 being perfect. Most groups running Solo Chrono chances are can do it without a Boon Ele as they will kill the boss before time runs out (Cairn/MO), but it definitely can push Chrono over the edge for permanent 10 Man Quickness in theory.
---
Sure, but for anything less than 50% boon duration, the new iteration is better.  It only does less work if you're using a ton if duration gear.
---
Not really. If you build up a chrono, you have to really consider Legendary gear. The thing is that the swings in changes have been from minimal to huge ( see 2 months ago with the Diviner introduction ). Also boonduration is not always the solution ( now it's not even the most recommended, but maybe it's again since they gutted the minimal DPS we had as chrono supports ).
---
Mostly, the problem is rotation being awkward and that to know you're doing well you have to consult logs or ask your squad if they had boons. Your job, as of now, is to give quickness and alacrity at start and try to keep them up on your teammates through the SoI. However, your own boons are inflated with boonduration and what you give is ot related to your boonduration. It's a lot of assuming and it's unfun to play not even knowing if you're playing correctly.
---
If you want more BD I would recommend running Aristocracy Runes over Lich. 
---
I left the game some months ago, when the sigil changes happened. Even at that time it was clear what ANet is trying to achieve and why.Back in the time when staff weaver was meta raids were really toxic because everyone wanted to play raids but no one wanted to learn rotations, what this caused is that people went on forums and complained about they being basically discriminated from raids because they "dont have the time" to learn weaver rotation. Even at that time, this wasnt true, doing normal/acceptable damange on weaver needed you to not even change your attunement from fire and just spam staff2/3/5,LH,FGS and MAYBE go into air for glyph.
---
For all this crying the response from ANet was to nerf staff weaver with a high learning curve and very much depency on the supports into nothing, and place braindead rotation classes onto the top of the charts.After weaver they dumbed down support chrono too.
---
Imo what ANet is doing, is that they DO NOT want to achieve perfect balance with the things like "skill needed to play" = rewarding , less skill needed to play = less rewarding but still viable scheme, they just want people to not complain on the forums, i remember that at that time, there were perry high rate of threads opening each week about this discrimination topic.
---
Now if you think why i talk about this nerf together with the staff weaver nerfs, is because if you look at it, they walk in the same shoes, both had "hard" to execute rotation, long learning curve, dependent on supports(in pChronos case this was slow uptime), and now the best part , THERE WERE (not even one) thereads crying about power chrono being too strong.
---
In the end, ANet won the fight by removing elitism with &lt;70IQ required to play classes.
---
But maybe am all wrong and only I see it like this, who knows :shrug:  
---
PS: Downvotes are welcome!
---
That's definitely true, but you would be crippling yourself for no reason, and lower skill groups could well be unable to complete an encounter without the boost.
---
I liked when CS was just used for CCs and extra Time Warps in bosses where CC was not that needed. That was the little adjusting we needed when we had the free utility slot back in the days.
---
If we only had 2 buffed wells and nothing more, it would be just fine. They want the Boonduration in the equation? Make the ticks dependable on that. It really is that simple.
---
I hope this post will get their eyes and eventually reconsider our gameplay because currently it's one of the most counter-intuitive and unfun out there.
---
All of *this* to bribe Zommoros into giving us the Legendary we want. 
---
I love quaggans. You're wrong.
---
Honestly I didn't know this was a mechanic until the other day when I finally popped my first Engineer to 80 and...whoa...maybe a new WvW main?
---
Do you really, really, *really* think arenanet decided to change this because they thought it's too difficult for some players to pull off?
---
Do you think they recieved lots of complaints like "anet I can't get this chrono trick down, can you delete it from the game?"
---
I agree this change sucks, but blaming it on the "laziness of others," and using that as an excuse to insult people and put them down...?
---
People play this game for fun. There's a group of people who enjoys playing more casually than others. I'm sure it happens sometimes that anet makes a change for the sake of one of the groups, to the detriment of the other. I really don't think this was the case.
---
Dear Lord, why go though so much pain if you can build the HoT version?
---
I agree with your sentiment, not your presentation. No need to insult more casual players. It really doesn't help make your point across. it is true however that exactly these kinds of interactions made me fall in love with chrono and it's also true that ArenaNet have removed many of them.
---
At this point I'm honestly just neutral about the whole thing. Probably gonna take a break from the game. Not because of this change. But because this is the kind of change that exemplifies how anet does balance.
---
You're overrated! Discuss that!
---
I don't mind Quaggans until they start talking and you're have to wait for them to take a million years to say a single line of dialogue. Other than that, they're fine. 
---
Do you think "Tempestuous Aria" is worth it ? For only 1utility which is not that great (in dps) ? Might isn't already cover without "Feel the burn" ?
---
Harmonious conduit is really great because you really don't want to be interrupt during your overload (and a small dps increase). Like that, you can take perhaps signet of earth to bring more dps ?
---
Sorry to spam you with comment but tempest is my favorite class =)
---
foo you 
---
The Jar-Jar Binks of Guildwars.  
---
sounds a bit boring though. make it add x% additional base-duration for outgoing boons for a few seconds after activating it. perfect rotations can go lower boon duration on gear and higher damage, or you just ignore it and spam wells with 100% bd gear, not being optimal but still functioning.
---
Lot of people (myself included) have been asking for banners to be like engineer turrets for some time.
---
Pretty good decision.
---
Like Energy cost in both Weapon and Utilities when similar systems *cough Thief cough* only affect one or the other and not both?
---
Or being locked out of even Racial Utilities? And each Legend not having "spare" utilities to shake them up a little (Shiro has another available Utility but you can only equip 3 of the 4 or something to that effect)?
---
Or that instead of Elite Specializations adding their new Utilities to a collective "pool" to be picked from by other channeled Legends, you have to channel that Legendary which is either underpowered in a lot of PvP/WvW settings, or can't be swapped off of on the same token without a serious loss in effectiveness?
---
But here's my counter to you, and this is not even specific to Arenanet and Guild Wars - I'm talking in general terms here about the entire game industry as I see it (but I'll use your example to highlight my meaning):
---
&gt; Player: "Chrono gameplay fucking sucks since the last patch" is a perfectly valid and normal thing to say.
---
No, I'm afraid it's not, and you yourself called out the reason. A perfectly valid and normal thing to say is "Since the last patch I have the sense that chrono gameplay has changed in a way that I like. Here are the things I've observed..." And then list your concerns in bullet point form. 
---
Game developers don't need you to write 3 pages deconstructing why you dislike a change they made to the game you love - in fact those lengthy posts can be, in many ways, also a challenge for busy developers to read because of their word/thought density and developers do have to also work on the thing we're assigned to build.
---
You said it well - respect given is respect earned. If you can only convey your thoughts in obscenities, then that's not helpful to developers, on any level, and although it might very well get a developer's attention, you're already poisoning the water with toxicity from the get go. 
---
I am not suggesting that developers can't learn things from players because we do, and I know that any studio worth its salt is doing exactly that (look at the recent example of Ubisoft changing an ending to one of their DLC because of player outcries). 
---
But you're also not privy to the developer side of it, which is that, by the very nature of what we do, it's **impossible** for you all to know exactly how complex and hard it is to build and ship anything. When it is said that "game development is hard" it is NOT to imply that an uneducated opinion is valueless or that it will be ignored, but it's an attempt to put into perspective for those on the outside that you probably can't begin to fathom just how complicated some problems are to solve. An analogy I like to use is, it's like going to the doctor, and wanting to give them feedback about how to perform the surgery that you need to have. Like, sure as the patient in that scenario, obviously telling them where the pain points are and what is bothering you is ESSENTIAL. But unless you yourself have medical training, does it seem reasonable to assume that you can give that doctor guidance about how to treat your condition?
---
At every studio I've ever worked at, and Arenanet excels at this, we looked tirelessly at the needs and desires of the community, and we measured those trends against what we ourselves put on our list of priorities  as trained professionals. What gets shipped is ideally a combination of those things, not one or the other exclusively.
---
I understand if you felt as though leaving feedback was useless if it didn't get a developer response. I'm sorry you feel that way, but it's a false assumption if you think that lack of a response indicates that your feedback wasn't seen and/or ignored. There's not enough time, manpower or resources to do everything on the list - it's always about triaging the most important things, and unless you're working at a game studio you are never going to have the insight into what gets pulled to the top of that list, no matter whether a studio communicates with its community or not. 
---
Anyway, I just want to state this because it's one of the things I see in many game communities that comes up (not just ours), and I honestly think there's this false belief that you need to say things nastily to get developer's attention, and I'm here to tell you that constructive criticism is a huge help to us, but saying something "fucking sucks" doesn't do anything except make developers feel attacked. That's a far cry from laying some painful truths on us like "I can no longer play the rotation I liked, because of X!!" 
---
And for the record, profanity isn't a turn off to some developers (some of us swear like motherforkers) but it can color your language in such a way as to be triggering for some, so I try and advise people to think whether you really need to do it when you give feedback.
---
Anyway, I appreciate you sharing your opinion. Hopefully I've given you some additional context to my side of the conversation.
---
In addition to prioritize your own fields, I think the field effects need an overhaul. Currently there is no logic to what a combo gives, neither on what kind of effect or if it buffs allies or hurt enemies. 
---
I'd create some guidelines for combos that makes it easier to figure out what you get by combining finishers and fields.
---
* All projectiles are offensive. No more regen to allies around the enemy hit by a projectile that passed through a waterfield. Just make it apply Weakness.
---
* All leaps grants an aura based on the field (stealth is an aura in spirit for this)
---
* Blast finishers apply both a possibive effect to allies and a negative effect to enemies.
---
* Whirl finishers do what they currently do and make projectiles all around you.
---
* Each field has a unique positive effect (mostly boons) and a unique negative effect (mostly conditions), no longer will blindess be found on **both** smokefields and darkfields.
---
This way you know that blasting in a field near you is going to give positive effects, even if you don't know what field is in the cluster of effects. Same with projetciles, you know that fireing through fields at your enemies will do additional badstuff instead of these strange effects like removing conditions on allies around the target.  
---
About two weeks in I had around 30 g.  I converted it to gems and got 3-4 character slots out of it.  Probably the best GW2 decision I've made.
---
That's some pretty amazing art. Really good job by the artist.
---
running around on your &amp; collecting things =/=  zero effort
---
True. No need to discuss.
---
Curious if Mirror Images will now be interesting to pull off a quick 3clones cs opener: Sword 3+MI, offhand 5, sword 5+cs, defender, disenchanter, soe, all three phantasms, cs end, all three phantasms, soe, all phantasms.
---
Or if the third slots flexible as it is and a new rotation will shine.
---
Actually now that both auras and shouts are 10man, and shouts granting fury and might, the only thing missing from Tempest is the dmg buffs druid have. Not so sure how might stacking in tempest works, if it's any good in 5/10 man but the rest is there. 
---
Meta in fractals but not in raids. Sometimes alac ren is used in raids but not paired with a firebrand. 
---
That's a possible way to go, yeah. The thing is, I want interactive gameplay with visible effects, but instead we are in a direction of "how weird and clunky can we make chronos do their job?".
---
Ooo I might be able to join this, I really want to get my Griffin finally!
---
yeah exactly. delaying some skills because you know you'll need csplit soon for cc anyway was always a cool feature imho, it rewarded predicting mechanics etc. but if you couldn't do that reliably, you just went for 100% BD and could still upkeep necessary boons, at the loss of some damage etc of course, which I think is perfect. don't destroy the main role for less-than perfect players, just lower their additional benefits.
---
the only thing I'd say is that wells desperately NEED to start giving their boon at the start for 1s/pulse and then a bigger pulse when it finishes. also, remove the f-ing 5-stack limit from quickness already, SoI copying all stacks has been gone for like a year or 2 now and that was the only reason for that idiocy - right now timewarp still kills it's own stacks when used at 100% BD.
---
me working: gonna put this, and this, and this on buy order, then get this
---
me at home, playing gw2: buy all! wtf i don't wanna wait a split second to craft that component
---
Haha, yeah Arenanet definitely has ownership over anything to do with its story, and while I was a biased fan of my Malyck story, it's for the team now to decide if/when it makes sense to explore that. If the day ever comes I'll be right there with you all, playing that content in whatever form it takes, because I really want to see it happen!
---
Just let's make every skill in game pulse around player. /s
---
That would remove strategic part of the game completely. Remember that gyros actually followed player anyway so I can understand that choice.
---
Quaggan are the minions of Spongebob the deep sea elder dragon 
---
It might be easier to simply make Blasts and Leaps, things commonly found on offensive abilities, apply conditions and negative effects on enemies hit by said Blast or Leap when cast in a field (Burning, Blindness, Daze, etc.)
---
Projectile finishers are purely offensive (such as projectiles from arrows, shots from guns) and Bolts from Whirls are the "wild card" which can either give boons to allies or further debilitate the enemy with conditions based on Field (Regen from water, Weakness from poison etc.)
---
S O R C E R Y
---
No. Anyone with an ounce of sense would know that it didn't mean Swiss people , and then say " Well obviously it doesn't mean Swiss people , that's idiotic , so let me google it and see what it is."
---
At some point, it's only logical to use resources gained from PoF.  After you exhaust your HoT Mats on your first 1-4 legendaries, then you can make you next one with PoF mats.  
---
&gt; My takeaway looking at specific devs and positions is that the GW2 cuts have been based on who's responsible for low engagement content. Like the new fractals and PVP balance patches that have been largely reviled. It may come down to "we're dropping that entirely", or may be a sign that they want a new direction behind those systems.
---
thats the thing i meant. there are quite a few things in the game that i would describe with the sentence "xy is cool, but...". there are problems with the game that havent been fixed in a long time. i dont think anet just ignores those problems, because they showed that they try, but who knows what was happening behind the scenes? maybe the people in charge just had no more ideas how to fix the content they were working at. that happens. once you're stuck you have to change something. 
---
i agree with you, that the game design since PoF was kind of lackluster. me and my friends were so hyped and excited about HoT. repeating the meta events for hours was fun. imo the final boss fight felt epic. (which bossfight was the final one in PoF? i literally dont remember, as we were fighting so many different big things at the same time and usually had mutliple fights vs the same enemy) playing the HoT living story maps felt great... i'm missing this from PoF. the only really positive thing for group content in PoF is... that WvW got some love? that isn't directly PoF-related though.
---
That's how banners work in Path of Exile and they feel great in that game.
---
Hi! 
---
Does this addon show the cooldown expiration alert as MSBT does?  
---
[IMAGE](https://ibb.co/C0txhfV)
---
If not, are you thinking about to include it? 
---
Thanks  :D
---
You didn't have to put it so harshly... Some of us aren't that fast.
---
Hmm well cind of makes sense. But Currently I still sit on 2k + Auric Dust, Airship oil and Ley Sparks. 
---
Funny thing is, I just completed my legendary set. I wanted to try out chrono, haven't had the will yet (have the gear and the means to buy whats left). Maybe one day. Rotations keep changing so I'm still waiting :) 
---
That sounds like a signet though. It may be that the best way we see it in guild wars to make sure it is not a signet is to have to cast it to the ground first and then pick it up. I dunno though, I am not a doctor?
---
But you could just use it into cs, right? Instead of signet aftercast then cs, cs then signet and should be the same result as before. The only downside is that the entire combo is slower and probably you will need more than 1 clone to do that.
---
Don't tell me learning the tanking patterns and tips for all bosses is "easy", compared to most other roles in a squad.
---
If Anet are going to give banners shorter cooldowns, it'd be nice if they all provided some kind of beneficial effect when slammed down, other than just a blast finisher. The Battle Standard is a downed finisher and ally revive, why not make the Banner of Defence grant barrier and the rest grant boons to nearby allies on slam (e.g. Banner of strength gives some might stacks, Banner of Tactics gives some seconds of alacrity, etc.)?
---
Agreed! That's exactly my thoughts.
---
I'm pretty disappointed with their changes to Boonbeast, they didn't hit it nearly hard enough imo. But at least there are a few fair nerfs so we'll see. (I would have liked to see Dolyak stance lose the damage reduction instead plus reduced might stacking from Axe AA and Fresh Reinforcements...)
---
Apart from that like you said looks good for PvP and overall I'm happy!
---
Also the reduction of stab duration on Corona Burst is definitely a significant nerf to Holo.
---
My reaction on seeing this change as someone who doesn't play Warrior and is constantly picking up banners:
---
**THANK GOD!**
---
Well, without *A* Druid would be a sizable DPS loss due to Spotter, Spirits, etc. But maybe running a Druid spec'd into more healing and run it beside this build? Pretty sure Druid has the lowest effective healing per second of all the "healing" classes; running a Tempest so you can use different traits could make the heals better without sacrificing might.
---
&gt; don't give me this "a soulbeast can take spirits" stuff, that comp isn't happening outside organized static runs
---
If this is providing might/fury/prot and extending boons, I can see the 26k dps probably being more value than the gain from sun+frost.
---
MFW I can down five enemies in WvW on one side of the battle field, but my com is yelling at me to drop it on five allies on the other...
---
Reaper kinda being pushed toward Power more and more.
---
The previous "Condi Reaper" build which was wildly paraded wasn't even that good, it was just unique and cool. 
---
Tbh no idea why Deathly Chill even exists anymore. It has horrible base damage being a Bleed, horrible scaling with the only merit being higher than normal base duration.
---
It just pales in comparison to the buffed up Reaper's Onslaught which gave Reaper access to perma quickness in Shroud now, making it a the excellent best pick for Reaper in terms of DPS. 
---
It's true and you should say it!
---
I recommend buying map rewards thingys from the pact agent network to gather some extra T6 materials and put some characters at the wood farm places. Or just farm sw day in day out if you like that more.. 
---
After spending almost 3 months and countless gold to finally craft Nevermore, I have to say to say that it was totally worth it. I love that tree branch.
---
Knowing to use all 3 potions is my "knowing when to jump".
---
Learning you *have* to use them is the hard part.
---
I think we misunderstood each other, now I get your point of view.
---
What I am adding is that the hidden boon uptime has no visible impact, and that is the "feel" we are lacking now. DPS players have numbers, we have assumptions. Those distorts are still here but honestly I wouldn't care less if they removed them.
---
I wouldn't say a lot more coordination is required. Just some getting used to it
---
Feel like pure shit just want her back
---
Yeah instead your eles and puglords now destroy banners if they pick them up.
---
You need to place banners **around** your team now
---
ffs
---
You should need fully offensive gear to get to 100%crit. Infact a lot of builds need assassins pieces to even get to 100% after spotter and banner. Plus Guardian has pretty high survivability as is 
---
I'm about 450g needed (thanks gw2.efficiency!) from crafting mine, my very first legendary. It feels like the final hurdle after everything I've done so far (buying a stack of mystic coins then seeing almost all of them disappear for a handful of clovers is the worst feeling), then I remember that I don't think I've ever even had 450g in my wallet at one time and cry a little inside. I still need 160 more amalgamated gemstones, I think that's where most of the gold cost is :s I can't wait to finish it! Then get totally burnt out and take a huge break from GW2 lol.
---
For me, the problem is that chrono just isn't fun anymore.
---
I don't bother regearing, just use some bootleg ~85-90% boon duration setups every patch. But they consistently make the rotation more awkward and annoying, or take away the interesting aspects of the class.
---
#makechronofunagain
---
I really like raiding, I love playing dps, but I always play chrono. Chrono used to be fun, I really liked timing my cooldowns to distort key attacks and see immediate feedback from my efforts (for instance, everyone getting knocked back if you screw up). It was satisfying. Modern chrono is not, I just spam my boons, use phantasms off cooldown, and sit there. There's no feedback, it's just boring. I can't even see my boon uptime until after the raid.
---
&gt;  It seems difficult to pick out things such as, say, VG's teleport circles
---
Your whole screen turns yellow if you stand inside?!
---
oh, then we did. Boon uptimes are hidden indeed, but that original post on the forums actually spends most of the time talking about distortion and ITS feel.
---
On another note, you can minmax DPS a lot on chrono right now. Doing 20-25k on VG and 7k while doing greens on Dhuum is broken and insulting, even if fun, but Anet did nothing to address it.
---
I've done a couple with Jungle Mastery gifts, but I actually prefer PoF to HoT.  I know that makes me an outlier.  I really dislike Dragon's Stand - the start time and required time commitment don't line up with my typical evening playtime.  Even though I play daily for 1-2 hrs it's a chore and I hate committing to the map, waiting 10 minutes before it starts, playing the map taxi game, zerging everything while being bored, and then risking having the map fall apart and a whole evening wasted because one lane can't hold up their end of the deal when we get to the pods.  
---
Desert mastery gift seems set up for people who have smaller chunks of time to play and that appeals to me. Four or five hearts, maybe a leg bounty or two, and I can go do whatever else I feel like.  
---
If you actually sit down and think about what the new rotation will be, this patch is a step in the right direction for fixing the rotation awkwardness.
---
Before you'd have to take timewarp for SoI to be useful in a one clone opener, this obviously hinders CC, which feelsbadman. TW&gt;cs&gt;shield5&gt;SoI&gt;wells. 
---
Now, you can get alacrity and quickness without having to wait an extended time or having to bring tw. WoR&gt;cs&gt;shield5&gt;SoI&gt;wells. Or you SoI after CS ends because it's 3s out of a total of like 115% uptime. On top of that, the wells aren't clunky and disjointed. 
---
They're clearly working on making chrono feel good with this patch. 
---
Your gear doesn't change with any of this, unless you were absolutely min maxing for exactly 100% uptime, but the dps between min maxed uptime and 100% boon duration is &lt;1k dps. Less on a boss. 
---
I understand your point and many friends have told me same, but you see, I like having some HP, and right now I'm testing gear combos on the Build Creator page to see if at least I can get pass 15,5k HP and get a 48,5-52% crit base and so far seems good
---
You are still gonna run one Warrior in every raid most likely. 
---
Daunting!
---
/r/unexpectedfactorial
---
Actually they cant. Patchnotes state that only the warrior can pick them up now. I think you should reread that.
---
That makes Quaggan saaaaad.
---
I have a few parked at one of the flax farms. One at either the iron or Platinum farm in the new map and one parked with all the krait in Mount maelstrom for the daily rusted key. 
---
In addition to that I have 1 char parked at matriarch in VB one in TD though with current clock times I don't get that much in this 6 months and one char for Tarir. It means I can jump between metas without having to worry about bag space and I also use those chars for handing in provisioned tokens when I drop the right weapons.
---
I have a dedicated festival char so I can try to keep all that crap to one char and not clutter them all up. I use thief because the mobility is useful for races and dps good for things like the freeze mini raid.
---
One char dumped in Thunderhead for the 2 metas but also do the Guild Hall nodes with him too. 
---
Fractal Chrono here and much of what you said is exactly how I feel.  I'm tired of having to watch videos every patch. Tired of having to change my gear, my rotation, my traits, my food.
---
It's gotten to the point that the second I feel comfortable in my new rotation and I'm feeling optimised, Anet release a new patch to scrap all of that.
---
I don't play other MMO's because I  hate the very common gear treadmill system and I enjoyed that Anet don't have that. However, this constant nerfing of Chrono has made it into a distinction without a difference. 
---
I don't expect Chrono to remain permanently unchanged, that would get boring and it's always good to shake up the meta but this is ridiculous. 
---
I dread patch days. 
---
Unless I missed something, the nerfs to Renegade aren't that substantial 
---
Getting truly top DPS on Deadeye requires you to use the rifle build, which is much more punishing and selective in use than just "pressing 5 buttons".
---
Additionally, the Thief class is a purely brought as a DPS option, it's imo fine that they therefore are also one of the top picks at doing just that, regardless of how many buttons you need to press
---
so confused by your argument. you correct him by telling him he is correct? you have to keep playing in order for your gear to stay relevant or else your ilvl will be left behind. 
---
Cripple yourself nothing, cut the bullshit man. These changes mean that groups interested in min-maxing/clearing bosses quickly/comfortably will need to change their playstyle. This doesn't force anyone who just wants to kill the bosses to bring certain classes, etc.
---
&gt;I don't have the latency to reliably pull it off
---
Latency is almost irrelevant here. If you pressed the skills with the same timings on 20 ping and 200 ping you'd achieve practically the same result. You may miss out on gravity well in CS if your ping is really bad, but otherwise CS should be long enough that the slight delay before you have access to your phanta skills (after activating CS) won't really affect you.
---
Looks like an old school magic card.
---
STO has around a million active players. That's not bad at all for a 9 year old MMO. And if it was not successful Perfect World wouldn't of let them build it out for console a few years back. They get new content out a hell of a lot faster than ANet too I might add. 
---
you could also buy Trophy boxes with volatile magic
---
If your talking about the one on Tuesday highly almost 1% likely.
---
The fact alone that we germans have such a fun word imho exemplifies what I mean by "culture issue", we don't even have to dig into their corporate culture to get an idea of that. If you want, I had an interesting exchange with an ex dev, so maybe that'll help you understand how they think over there when it comes to making mistakes, admitting them and taking criticism.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aupskj/matthew_medinas_journey_with_arenanet_team_and/ehfg7i5/?context=8&amp;depth=9
---
Just linking the whole mini AMA there, you'll find your way through. Needless to say I don't agree with Matt on many things, but the biggest disconnect I felt was in his latest response when he talked about whether or not "chrono gameplay fucking sucks"  is a valid thing to say as a player of the game. Apart from whether or not you agree with me or him on that one, and I think you don't need to agree with me here and the devs side holds all the power so it's better to agree with them and play by their rules, I think it speaks volumes of how they approach this topic of standing up to their mistakes.
---
Always satisfying to see Boonbeasts get clapped.
---
Stupid cheese of a class which just stacks a billion boons and think they hot shyt. 
---
Honestly, the banner changes (the utility banners at least) just seem really awkward. You already had permanent banners with alacrity and the only annoyance was that you could accidentally pick them up. Why not just have them be uninteractable and keep the cooldowns the same? As it stands now, you have to pick up and replace your banners or you'll have down time even with alacrity. It's just unnecessary busywork that won't be satisfying to anyone.
---
Its a 25% nerf to rampent vex which if i mathed right is a 8.25% dps loss assuming 100% critical chance. Mace 2 is also a 25% nerf on overall burning damage but is less significant due to being up only when on kalla.
---
I think a roadmap would also be quite dangerous to release right now. With so many changes going on in the company things might change. Releasing their first roadmap and then not being able to follow it would only hurt them.
---
They first need to get used to the new structure of the company and then sit down to reevaluate their plans for future content. Once everything rolls again they could release a roadmap, but not before. Last thing we need is having the community seeing the first thing on a roadmap being changed and freaking out about GW2 being doomed.
---
Except they aren't amusing, but are instead a species made with forced "cuteness".
---
They are annoying, serve no actual purpose, and if they were eradicated from Tyria, the average person wouldn't even bat an eye.
---
Drooburt does NOT help their case either.
---
I'm convinced that no build or rotation will ever be safe if it relies on animation canceling or aftercasts as a build-defining characteristic.  I wish ArenaNet would be more clear about what is or isn't intended gameplay.  I'm not terribly surprised by this update to power chrono, but it's really becoming irritating to have to tap dance around what anet considers acceptable gameplay. 
---
Simply shooting down every suggestion is not constructive, idiot. If you do not have anything positive to add to the conversation, then shut your damn mouth.
---
Well after reading these changes. You have to hand it to Anet at least they have no issue hiring those with special needs.
---
Useless in WvW maybe, but did you notice it now grants barrier to allies? The base version doesn't do that, support scourge is happy.
---
Hahaha ahh a gem in the rough.. Love it!
---
Imagine being so significant to thousands of people among countless races they make songs like these for you expressing their hope ,faith and their need for you..
---
Condi Berserker may be fine but Power Berserker is gutted. Increased cast time for Primal Burst (GS) and Headbutt make it too clunky to use. I tried it few months ago and just went back to Power Spellbreaker.
---
Nerfing damage is one thing but increasing cast time is way more noticable and annoying.
---
I get what you're saying, and reading the notes I already thought that much ( less dependable on TW and doulbe wells ), but what I think it's the issue is that this is not a final change, but just another one that will eventually get re-re-re-re-balanced again in 2 months.
---
This patch does nothing about the real issues that chrono has, which is having a locked skillbar set ( we can change the Elite probably now, but still depend on CS ) and don't know the boons we're providing. Previously we could see our own boons to know. This is counter-intuitive. Why does it have to be like that?
---
Yeah, we'll get a new rotation this time again, but we're really going around the issues without actually making it simple enough for a new player to know they're doing good. They still have to assume. Are Raids so impactful on the game that we need to give up so much flexibility and visual informations? Why can't the chrono revolve around 2 wells and keep variance in a 3rd utility slot and CS+elite?
---
I am not saying to dumb it down for the sake of it, but I am saying that if what we want to give is 2 boons, we should have 2 skills to give them. Let us do some DPS even if it's not 100% uptime, or give other kinds of support.
---
I can't to get into discussions about future plans at the studio because A.) it would not be within bounds of my NDA and B.) it would not be within bounds of my NDA. LOL 
---
In all seriousness though, **speaking purely for myself here** I have suggested a "codex" for the game probably since I started working on Guild Wars in 2003 - it's just one of those things that, unless you plan for it from the start, is really hard to add in later given the sheer density of text that exists in an MMORPG.
---
I'm glad someone has raised this. Some of those maps are fantastic but tbh I don't do them very often. Part of this is weirdly because of every single map having dailys associated with it.
---
Now in the first few maps from bloodstone fen it was great. Gave me a few extra bits to do each day but I found after the 3rd map it became grindy and started to become "too much".
---
There is of course the you don't have to do it argument but for those of us who are a little completionist orientated just knowing that they are there is frustrating. I guess for a lot of people that won't make much sense but some will recognise the struggle. Basically after the 3rd map I stopped doing the dailys on all maps because it was easier to not do any at all than start some then get frustrated by not having time to do them all.
---
Personally I would love the LS maps to change from daily rewards to reintroducing monthly rewards with a slightly lowered threshold (don't just make 30 days of dailys into one monthly by multiplying it by 30!). That would give me a reason to revisit those maps and gradually nibble away at things over the month rather than feeling overwhelmed that there's 10ish maps each with 4 dailys.
---
Choice is good but too much choice can have a negative effect - and yes there is research to back this up. Cant remember the name of the study off the top of my head but some supermarkets have taken it on board reduced the numbers of lines they have per product (ie 13 varieties of lasagne down to 4 or 5) and its resulted in a significant growth of those products as shoppers don't feel overwhelmed and make a decision easier rather than buying nothing at all.
---
Just my 2 cents. Dont expect many to agree but 
---
Not the person you asked, but I do something similar on my alt chrono. On that one I now have full ascended diviner armour with pack runes and then exotic berserker weapons and trinkets (the trinkets with platinum doubloons). Boon duration with food is around 75%. I've used the set up in story missions and open world after a trait swap and it's perfectly fine. Yeah, you'd get more damage done if you went with full berserker/assassin, but I doubt you'll need it. 
---
How is picking up your banners to maintain uptime less clunky then just dropping them and forgetting about them?
---
The only thing we know is that there were at least 2 projects and at least one of them was a mobile title.
---
That is it. Unless someone breaks an NDA which is incredibly unlikely, we will never know anything else.
---
Ehh giving base engi a well-like skill when scrapper now has wells is too much I think.
---
I'd rather they rework turrets into like... I dunno, "Attachments"? So you have Rifle Attachment, Flamethrower Attachment, etc. and activating an attachment gives you a buff that adds procced attacks for a short duration. So some spitballing would be...
---
Flamethrower Attachment: When you inflict bleeding on an enemy, launch of a wave of flames in front of you (ICD).
---
Rifle Attachment: When you critically strike an enemy, fire a bullet (ICD, 20% projectile finisher).
---
Thumper Attachment: Stuns, Dazes, Launches, and Knockbacks are more powerful. When you incapacitate an enemy, launch nearby enemies (ICD).
---
Rocket Attachment: Attacking enemies beyond a range threshold fires a rocket.
---
They dont usually do last minute additions to patches. Maybe next time!
---
The video is right on spot. The continuum split at the aftercast of the signet was nust marvellous, satisfying when it worked. Having played ONLY power chrono during my entire gw2 life, I can say I'm extremelly disappointed by this change. It came from nowhere, and it was not needed. Now the rotation won't be as beatiful as it used to be.
---
I'm deeply saddened by this change.
---
Raising the skill floor and lowering the skill ceiling has been ArenaNet's go-to approach in terms of balancing for quite a while now. In-depth knowledge of traits and skills and how they interact precisely becomes less relevant with every patch. Mesmer is a good example for this but there is many other cases where interesting interactions that were vital to mastering classes have been patched out despite having been in the game since launch.
---
Your recipes don't make any sense. A halloween pail is made of plastic and a FUEB is made of something fractalie. Neither of those would use thread to attach a rune.
---
I guess it's not as much about handling player's ambitions, which can be very unpractical, but more about letting them test your game earlier and giving valuable feedback to what's already implemented, which in turn should make it easier for developers to detect what is clearly right or wrong with their own systems and polish them up.
---
I actually don't know much about early access, but some companies like Riot Games have test servers where players can test (and discuss) upcoming changes for League of Legends. According to developers, those servers are great to catch bugs or test the foundation of those changes, even if they're not that great for actual skill balancing (due to the lack of matchmaking and the small player sample size). But it does allow the community to caught some really obscure but potentially broken combos. Riot also generally discusses with its community before doing large champion or system reworks, and many valuable concerns are taken into account long before new content is released.
---
Better than a moron on oxy...
---
I have my mesmer at the lions arch JP and i port people sometimes.
---
Other alts are parked in various LWS3 zones where i do a quick run around to get a bunch of currency from each. This way i get closer to finishing various collectibles a bit closer every day.
---
They are all lvl 80, but im sure other people place their alts somewhere more profitable and also use lower lvl characters
---
So.... Daredevil?
---
Good riddance to elusive long-stealth Deadeyes in WvW.  I got so pissed off at the simplistic cheesiness of Deadeye and the lack of counterplay, that I embraced the "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em" mantra and built an Ascended instakill Deadeye.  And I have to say, the last update with changes to Sentries and Revealed hurt some, but not enough.  The new changes should make a big difference, which means that I can go back to running something other than Deadeye in WvW.  Now if the dev's would remove stealth stomps, I'd wash their cars for a year.
---
When people are desperate for karma farming
---
Reaper have always been focused on power. The "problem" is taking reaper granted better utility in shroud compared to core shroud and you got Deathly Chill. The reason those were there is because necro is *the* condi profession. As DC got buffed / nerfed it meant reaper could be viable as hybrid or full condi depending on the state of it. It's just how they design most specs - even if it's clearly a power or condi spec they often have a little bit of the other. With reaper the "little bit of the other" just became too strong. Power with chill were the "fantasy" of reaper, so it made sense that chill dealt some damage. Then it was just a balancing issue.
---
If you look at abilities it's clear to be a power based spec. 
---
1) Yes they will. 100 power and condi dmg, precision and ferocity is still a lot of stats among 5/10 players
---
2) It will take time to learn, stability, and timing for it to work, meaning we will see other optional elites for those who cant pull it off
---
Just a note: you should run assassins instead of zerker to cap crit.
---
Honestly, the signet trick always felt like an exploit to me. It is very odd that the devs seems to have balanced the class around that trick for years though and now just remove it without compensating at all?
---
Highness has not been with us for a while now, sorry. :(
---
Being a GM can be very, very hard. It's a job where you get yelled at, lied to, sworn at, you have to continuously move forward - some folks sadly burn out over time. That is not saying they are not great agents, some of my best members worked so hard they burned themselves out after only a few months. 
---
I try to keep a current roster updated on https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2_Support_Team, to make sure you can always check in on the team and who is around - and so the team can see I appreciate them enough to put their names out there.  They are all awesome. :3
---
(Please note this does not mean you can request your ticket to be specifically handled by a certain GM, whenever a team member is free, they pick up the next ticket. It's very rare you'd be lucky enough that that one GM you want grabs your ticket. Especially SGMs and LGMs have other tasks outside of crushing the queue, so asking for us specifically may not be your best bet.)
---
thats kinda a cool idea with movement/adrenaline and losing it if CC'd and such. That all alone sounds neat to me. 
---
Nah, how it like a dagger and swing it like a thief. Give it a backstab through stealth. 
---
&gt; derailed
---
nuff said.
---
Reaper was always ment to be power, but like in most elite specs, a few traits and a skill are enough to enhance the other 2 core specs and weapons and skills to turn it into condi, or vice versa.
---
Nothing wrong with it honestly. I like how soulbeasts has a lot of condi things, but can also pull off some incredible power based bursts
---
Wow, this is actually really good! I'm so impressed. 
---
man man. That entire zoo worth of blood, bones and claws were for the *bird* on top!! The wood it would take obliterating a Brazil-sized rain forest to collect is for the branch!
---
Would a program that automatically sets offers and posts items for sale on TP be bannable?  I think so 
---
core warrior is still as strong as the elite specs
---
I love mine as well.
---
I think your proposal for a split approach (some things are surprises, some are more collaborative) sounds like one worth exploring more, definitely. I don't know if it'll happen, but hopefully there is room for more conversation. And l very much appreciate your kind words on my future. :-)
---
This is amazing. And so true.
---
I would say most likely gear and money (I assume those go hand in hand). Not too worried about achievements since I probably wouldn’t be able to bump those out playing a couple hours a day. Outside of the game, I can watch a few YouTube videos at work to learn raids/fractals. 
---
Its better actually, you net a total of 2 extra seconds of Boons in a CS rota with 2 Chronos 
---
I played condi reaper at HoT launch. You could also use chilling darkness to make blind-&gt;chill-&gt;condi dps. Then I used death nova and minions for tanking and poison dps. With rune of thorns HoT felt like a walk in the park and I never understood why people thought HoT was hard. Fun times :)
---
I was wondering which one is it but since effects had this:
---
&gt;effects
---
&gt;1.
---
&gt;a change which is a result or consequence of an action or other cause
---
I thought it could be: "Change ("zoomies") is a result of an action (mirage cloak)."
---
Do what you want really, this is more about having fun than keeping up with progression (due to horizontal progression).
---
Make yourself a goal and work towards that. Do you want a Legendary? Do you want to experience all raid content? Do you want specific achievements? Looking for a specific skin?
---
Then go from there.
---
For example, if you want a full condi set, maybe you need to get yourself lots of gold and twilight arbor tokens (for the superior rune of the nightmare), so do a daily run of Istan (for fast gold) and Twilight Arbor.
---
While stat switching is obviously a big convenience, players grind their way up to get that convenience. If you offer a credit card swipe option to bypass that grind how is it not pay to win? Just take the nonstop downvotes as a hint to your naivety and move on.
---
This conversation could be about dodge-jumping (which is even more unintuitive to discover by yourself than the SoE+CS interaction) but Anet decided to acknowledge it and leave it as a feature instead of patching it out.
---
time to switch winds out for battle standard in wvw because new battle standard is beast.
---
Then just pick up the ele's conjures instead ;) They won't mind.
---
Wow. Great idea, i guess you're going to be next USA president?
---
With this, and Aurene in the start of LS4E4 looking like she's hacking up a hairball, I can only come to one conclusion:
---
Most of the animation team has two or more cats per person.
---
Affect = verb, effect = noun.  Since the verb is done by the subject, which is the cloak *doing* the affecting, it's a verb. Alternatively, you could say "This change is an *effect* of the cloak." Easier to identify it as a noun as it'll probably have "an" before it. I'm sorry I'm really bad at explaining this.
---
This is a really cool commission and the artist did a really good job with your character. Definitely on my list to check out.
---
My wife and I will be joining for sure. 
---
What are you looking for in terms of donations?
---
Not painful enough.
---
5k gems. xD
---
And that's why I am totally okay for getting SoI out of the rotation. The new iteration is the bane of your gameplay that's been tormenting us with hidden infos and halted development elsewhere because it can break us again. Reworking SoI is one step that's needed for sure.
---
Yes, but Ford USA still owns Ford EU/whatever. Ford USA got access to all data/patents etc.
---
Being present on different markets can be a good idea. As example if competition in asia gets tougher and profits shrink. Or if the market gets more "west-like".
---
Another problem might be at some point: concentrating on core market = regional company. At some point global companies with more money (EA?) might take over and kick you out of business.
---
&gt; precursors that shared basic non-unique icons with other exotic weapons...
---
Ah, Storm, if only I had known then you were important...  
---
Worked out for me in the end, but it was a long haul to get it from bound exotic to Legendary for Sale. 
---
I've been there, but before no time to play, i had a lot of time to play, and it was a hard transition, now i can do whatever but don't focus on anything. 
---
Although it is not impossible, 
---
* you can do daily t4 easy, or prepare for it until you can (day by day);
---
* you can do story and episodes if you wish - they will just take more time to complete, and with current release speeds you will have more than enough time to not fall behind;
---
* you can pvp, or wvw. 
---
Just not 3 different things in one day. There is no where to rush to, and you can focus on one thing and pursuit it, or mix different stuff each day/week. Game is playable in small chinks, only real problem would be raiding, which is solvable with weekends or strict scheduled static group.
---
so d912pxy would require to make new shares for it? maybe someone should do a collection for some good ones or something
---
It's fine. At least I learned something and I hope someone reading this will too! (This isn't sarcasm btw)
---
for gear and money I would def. start playing fractals. you will get lot of ascended stuff in the later tiers and the gold isnt bad either.
---
maybe try to establish a meta event chain for yourself that you play every day.
---
a very popular one atm is Verdant Brink nighttime (only killing the matriarch)---&gt; switch maps to tangled depths for gerent meta---&gt; switch maps to auric basin for tarir meta---&gt; death branded shatterer in jahai bluffs.
---
then you also can do palawadan and the great hall daily in istan and both metas on the new thunderhead peaks map.
---
that will give you a good amount of (special) mats and gold every day.
---
check out the event timer on the wiki to coordinate it better: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers
---
Haha, glad to try to be of service. It'll come with practice. 
---
Yes, had that pointed out in another comment. I was tired and got non-Chrono alacrity mixed up with Chrono alacrity. Silly Chrono main brain
---
Has? Maybe they *are cats*. Or stuff is motion capped by actual cat.
---
People already shell out a ton of money just to buy a legendary as is.
---
Hello /u/ReallyNotMaebbie
---
I enjoy this idea and I think it's one of the greatest I've seen. It will definitely be a great idea if they decide to implement it. I'm interested if you want to give me a fully detailed idea on this (about 15-20 lines, not 3) and if it's ok to you to publish it in my online magazine so that lots of other people will see it.
---
If you agree, please reply to my comment here with the full text.
---
It's a side story that came out a few years ago. If you walk into one, you'll get an achievement and unlock an entire set of achievements, the main one being a little storyline to get them to stop. Unfortunately, the story can only be done once per account, so I highly suggest you check the [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Burden_of_Choice) for more information.
---
YES
---
On that I think everyone agrees (•‿•)
---
Don't let the armchair-CEOs freak you out too much. :P 
---
Restructuring is a scary time, but that's the uncertainty talking. You've got *plenty* of content to hammer through, and by the time you're through all that, we'll have a better vision of where this big change is taking the game as a whole. :)
---
&gt; Anet decided to acknowledge it and leave it as a feature instead of patching it out
---
That's the difference. In today's case they decided to patch it out. It's their choice to make.
---
Aww, thank you so much for the love, I'm so glad that you found some solace in the world we crafted.
---
With any project as big as Guild Wars 2, there's always going to be *interest* in pursuing loose story threads, of course. But it comes down to what is most important for the team to devote resources to, since there's a finite amount of content that can be built, by any developer. There are definitely people at the studio still, who care very deeply about all of the things we had left untold or unfinished. I for one am excited to see where the story goes from here!
---
I made it all the way to their comments on SAB returning. By that point I was laughing too hard at my phone at work and had to stop.
---
There it is, the most stupid thing I'll read today.
---
a noble effort
---
I don't know of a guide for Istan. TBH it's quite straight forward.
---
You 100% want to join a squad for it, and then you just follow the group around and hit anything that's a Champion. Bring a weapon that can tag quickly from a range, I'd recommend (i.e. GS for Mesmer I find works well).
---
The other thing is to make sure you watch the map for chest spawns. After every area/event that you move along during the meta, ~2 chests will spawn. Go quickly loot them before running onwards to the next area (getting them afterwards is death).
---
You may miss stuff on your first run, but you pick up on it easy enough.
---
I’ve heard people also spam the silverwaste meta as well, what’s your opinion on that?
---
I mean, Condi BS was dealing a bit too much damage for how much it actually brings to the group. Power BS on the other hand ... Yeah, IDK
---
There was a reason for this change. It was gimmicky and unintended.
---
I've been power reaper since HoT began, but yeah I remember that -- was a combination of a Curses trait with the Reaper one. Rune of Thorns meta was because someone here found out and posted about it!
---
The items are bought from heart vendors. This trains does not do hearts. You will be fine without gold
---
You and me are the same.
---
Outside of PvE it's pretty much a cheesy burst spec that fails in the target doesn't die instantly. 
---
That about sums it all up.  Good Job
---
Same here. I loved the little guy for knocking people off point or for CC paired with Hammer 5. Now, I don't see me playing PvP much anymore with my scrapper. R.I.P. my little red gyro buddy.
---
As a warrior player, I'm ecstatic that these cursed flags are nerfed.
---
Wouldn't be so epically bad if artificial scarcity from shoddy drop rates wasn't exacerbating the problem. 
---
Thank you! Can I use TP to a friend?
---
By having fun.
---
And there it is -- 'If people really care about GW2'.
---
Do you think the majority of people who spend their time criticizing the game do so because they don't care? They write up posts, spend time fussing and worrying about things ANet is or isn't doing, telling the devs to do something do so because they don't care?
---
That attitude is pretty ignorant of the fact that some people are trying to deduce what on earth is going on precisely because they care.
---
This reddit is full of people on both ends of idealism and realism and optimism/cynicism. Some are in the extremes. But at the end of the day, a lot of people care about the game. The gatekeeping of 'man look at all these carebears' and 'you guys are killing the game and the devs' is asinine.
---
They have a history of nerfing when the class is used in record runs. Until then they don't bother.
---
They never look at if the average player can actually do high damage with it or even play the build in a real scenario.....
---
Feelsbadman
---
The staff is called “The Crossing” 
---
if we get one of these every month or every two months, i'll be a happy camper.
---
When the endgame is skins, and most skins are acquired through gold, you're less than encouraged to spend said gold on other things, like gear.
---
Oh my mistake then, I got it from discord and some1 said it was old...
---
better take it down then...
---
Yes, definitely! The team did raise the bar of excellence. All or Nothing's final instance was one of the most impactful story moments I've ever experienced in any video game, ever. A few years ago, I would have never dreamt of the community as a whole crying or being elft in a state of shock, with youtube reaction videos and internet articles being written about it.
---
(I'm afraid the lay-offs may affect what's to follow in ep6 and lw5.)
---
i keep telling myself i will return to these maps to farm collections and AP one day but so far i never have. but i do intend to.
---
i abandoned thunderhead keep the moment i finished the story as that story/map has really bad memories. if that story gets better then i will return to it, as if all is forgiven (i hope it gets better).
---
i get the feeling that all the new maps could have been and had so much more, but time and resource constraints left them bare and unfinished. perhaps now with anets re-focus maybe they will return to finish them all.
---
You're all set then!   Find the most amusing great sword you can and start working through the rotation.  
---
Gravedigger non-stop during boss trains is so much fun.  
---
Question from a not-informed-at-all on this topic: 
---
could d912pxy use super lightweight shaders to further lowering requirements for gw2 and increasing fps in very old PCs?
---
No, Legendary items are like a status symbol, not a convenience item. It shows everyone around you that put in work or got hella blessed by RNJesus. Don't cheapen what others have done with this.
---
*u/samino8, you think your Kim Possible cosplays are great, and they actually are!*
---
Sorry for the late response! Usually by the time we get to Dragon's Stand, a good amount of people have filtered out because it's been a long day. I'm sure there will be plenty of spots then :D Occasionally, if we lose too many people, I'll merge both squads into one and there will be less room, but shoot me a whisper and I can coordinate with some of my regulars for you to taxi into the same map as us.
---
Hopefully it's still well-organized this time! I'll be honest, I've been taking a bit of a hiatus from GW2, so I'm quite rusty, haha. I haven't had time to review my pathing since this week has been super busy for me x.x
---
does it work with radial mount wheel?
---
If it's installed properly, all you need to do is start the game.
---
The game world will look very glitchy initially as d912pxy builds the shader cache. Once that's done, then the game would work normally.
---
So ...you saying if anone take this picture and make 5-10 second long video,it could pass as a stream highlight?
---
I see cat tempest, i like.
---
Seriously though, nice showcase. I am going to spread this to my guildies asap (we have some ele mains).
---
Quick question: Is it ok just to install new version on top of of the old one?
---
Till now I have been playing it safe and uninstalling/removing the old version before installing new version.
---
Im asking this because playing after having installed it, all other players and enemies are invisible, as well as most buildings lol
---
Ummm... no? Orders from Above has a 20 second base cooldown, so 16 seconds with alacrity. With 100% boon duration, there's only a 2s buffer window for maintaining alacrity which doesn't add up that fast.
---
Love you guys too!

They're more amusing than Quaggans.
---
This short sighted. It will fuck the game model in the long term by reducing player play time and perceived item value. 
---
That's normal. D912pxy needs to build a shader cache as it encounters new shaders to translate. Once it's done, the game will look normal.
---
His traits are Arcane while this is Earth. I'm not good enough at ele to know which is better but think noodle said Earth is better if you have to stay in Earth for a while. He used the same gear, trinkets and renegade runes (though he did say he wasn't an expert at ele runes).
---
I've always loved that staff skin for Necros but I just could not get into using a staff as a Necro.
---
Honestly, I'm just not sold on anything that relies on blasting fire fields. In my experience, that usually ends with Area Condi Cleanse instead of might (*especially* if you're deliberately playing with Guardians).
---
I think you can maintain might with Pyromancer's Puissance, though you would lose Fury.
---
TAA pls ffs xD
---
you should make paypal/patreon if you dont have it (besides bitcoin), there might be at least some people who are willing to give something back to you
---
Well let's take three examples: WoW, EvE and Runescape.
---
in runescape, you cast a spell to heal someone.
---
In WoW, you cast a spell to heal someone.
---
In eve, you run repair cycles to repair someone.
---
In gw2 if you're a water elementalist, you have 0 direct heals basically, and most of your healing capability is either very light or on cooldown. It's got some similarities with Dota2. If you're a druid, you have to have an enemy involved to use your basic heal usable, you can't just beam the ally directly.
---
In WoW and EvE, stealth is a thing you do, it's permanent. in GW2, it's more of an in-combat thing (by the way, I'm not complaining about this)
---
The ranger's first unlock with sword (aside from 1) is hornet sting, which is actually a gtfo button.
---
Point is, a lot of tactics in gw2 are very indirect and are seemingly designed for combination tactics, and I don't think that appeals to people immediately. I think the spirit utilities for ranger are the best examples of this.
---
You see what I mean? I dunno, I had a really hard time getting a mindset for gw2 and I still find ranger utilities to be kinda meh. The outcome though, is a fantastically dynamic and complex game that is very fun to play. It's just hard to get a mindset for it for me.
---
Mike Z is doing a good job as game director.
---
Well that explains it.  I thought it had something to do with cheese or chocolate.
---
As an ex-banner warrior, fuck playing the banner mechanic. It was already boring. I dont understand how a warrior, a frickin warrior class known for bashing stuff in every rpg and mmo is babysitting stationary AOE buffs in gw2. Great design.
---
yes, but still you need to run installer to install it fully
---
Yes. The installer will override old files.
---
It also means that the shader cache will get overridden too, so d912pxy will have to rebuild it.
---
"Use at your own risk"
---
For noobs like me, what's the worst case scenario? Game crash? Bricking my computer?
---
Haha, i should just remove the sword altogether and just add a microphone :D
---
The Skull Masque is AFAIK the only proper facepaint, so you chose well.
---
From now on i'll just turn down the speech volume during story missions and read the text in Zapp's voice :D
---
Dude, this is an office not Band of Brothers.  
---
Those 'good devs' are going to be working because that's what they're paid to do.  Somehow I think they'll be able to muster the strength to *work on a video game* despite some people they kinda knew who worked in the same building not being there.
---
Game crash or ANet ban, if they decide to do it. 
---
It’s not significant, just annoying.
---
Be real for a moment here, do you actually like the current rotation? Most of the chronos I have talked to don’t (including myself). These changes just push the chrono rotation into an even more gimmicky-I have to wait for stuff to happen before I use my things-playstyle. Not exactly what I would call fun.
---
&gt; Why try to solve a puzzle when you only have 1/4 of the pieces? 
---
Because it's human nature basically. That's literally how our brains work, it's not going to change.
---
Well, if you "directly" connect London and New York on Google Earth, you get a distance of 5500 km, While Seattle/New York is \~4000 km.   
---
Plus, if you have fiber cable across the ocean, it kinda adds up.  
---
i think very old PCs need special build or settings for d912pxy, cause for now i take everything i can get for performance.
---
d912pxy folder should be next to gw2-64.exe file
---
There is nothing with the code that appears against the TOS such that it would get you banned.
---
I believe the dev is just being safe in the off chance that ANet went crazy and determined some part of the code gave some unfair advantage and banned people. Though, anet might have given some blessing and I missed it so don't take my word as gospel ... regardless this code has been a godsend on a 780gtx M with a 3840 x 2160 attached monitor. I will continue to use it seeing as I can play WvW with it, with high model count and view distance.
---
As the one who mostly started going weekly trainings in my guild static each week since New Year, I find it a very steep slope when it comes to leg gear. For now I need to kill Gorseval 4 more times (Because they rarely run w1 trainings), as well as Keep Construct (And I've heard that Spirit Poison sometimes can bug out and not trigger the collection on kill), Castle and Xera, and then I must grind gemstones before clearing challenges in w4. And these are just the precursors.
---
Hang your PC so you need to reboot it.
---
This will be the new WvW meta.
---
Yeah that's about it. It's okay for non-scheduled runs, for weekly scheduled runs where my squad try to clear as fast as possible, it's not worth the burden to have potentially choppy fights :\
---
Yes. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/Temp_Update
---
I used the banner speed boost skill all the time.. I am quite sad they removed it.  Also frustrated that I may destroy banners trying to res downed people who fell near them .. ..
---
will try out
---
&lt;3 T_T
---
Exactly what i was thinking about. If i am not mistaken, intel integrated gpu supports dx12 from 4 gen
---
No need to make Chrono more OP. Just make the wells working on 10ppl in PvE, SoI reworked in a way it doesn't provide boons to the squad and a most probably we're very close to just 1 chrono needed.
---
And the asura has one eye it seems?
---
If you can do it - do it! :D
---
&gt; "Don't stand in damage"  
---
It's so very true, yet surprisingly hard for a melee build. The instinct to want to be hitting things when there's a fight is honestly pretty hard to overcome. Iin a mid-sized blob fight that isn't completely converged yet, it's surprisingly hard not to overstep your bounds as a melee build.
---
Listening to a comm over voicechat would alleviate this, but I haven't even been able to find a WvW map that had a commander on voice chat. This is Desolation btw, where back in the day, every other chat line was someone spamming for people to join the TS server and listen in.
---
Oh no, I must know.. Did the guy behind SAB get laid off?? I hope he's still around so he can one day finish W3.
---
Found it curious that you slotted 3 expertise infusions to get to 95%. I think Im missing something here?
---
How about a version for integrated gpus, could be possible? (ofc i get that is somehow not so usefull and better to focus on improving performance of standard version)
---
I haven't actually looked up any rotations with my chrono, I dislike the idea of blindly following some meta build instead of figuring out a playstyle that feels natural to me. Not to talk about the complexity of the rotation which I'd never be able to execute.
---
I whish man, I whish \^\^
---
Haha  xD &lt;3 U
---
I had that exact same thought, and I really hope it's because of the latter.
---
They should offer gem subscribtions maybe 1000 gems for $10 a month with a bonus item and they probably should sell the season pass in advance 
---
Oh my yes. This may get me to come back to WvW roaming / havoc. Movable fields of so many types... 
---
But I don't have time to get a legendary but I bought the game so they should just give me what I paid for. /s
---
Honestly, the issue is that there's no real "in game problems" that could be solved via gem-store additions. The only thing I can think of would be stat-swapping, which most of the players that want it already have it, and the players who don't couldn't care less.
---
This game is like the ultimate in convenience, to sell features and solutions to players, they would have to remove free systems and lock them behind a paywall, and i'd find it hard to believe that they would do that.
---
The one item that MIGHT match that description is the waypoint unlock box, anyone who buys that is being cheated HARD.
---
one could say, a *nob*le effort
---
How do you compare raid bosses? Do you only count the bosses released per expansion or the ones dropping current tier gear? Pretty difficult comparison as most other MMOs render their own raid content futile within months while GW2 raid encounters simply start adding up.
---
Blade and Soul is a F2P MMO. Almost all F2P MMO have this kind of thing nowadays. It's a game for veterans and whales, there's no way for a new player to play that game without spending lots and lots of money. Just like all free to play MMO that I know of. 
---
It's not exclusive to NCWest.
---
" **DO NOT let them touch this game.** " it's kinda impossible since they own the game

I miss this because of work.
---
Well, now you can pickup and reposition the banners ~16s after you place them without losing uptime.
---
So you no longer have to carry them from place to place, and ask your teammates to help.
---
Pros and cons both ways I guess.
---
OK here's your down vote
---
Good lord NO, man! Are you out of your mind?? Legendary items are earned, not bought. That would completely kill what little endgame we have lmao
---
Or just walk.
---
The troll wins.
---
Gotta love how my **Berserker** is forced to play a support role purely due to extremely overpower banner utilities from the core profession.
---
No less informative than demands for transparency.
---
yeah Josh Foreman got laid off, he was working on another project for a while, which is also a reason we didn't got jumping puzzles anymore. 
---
So no hope for new SAB worlds
---
Oh snap!
---
&gt; How do you compare raid bosses? 
---
Only by count, never by quality, reception, or ease.
---
&gt; GW2 raid encounters simply start adding up
---
At a rate of roughly 1 set every 300 days or so, currently - with the exception of the first couple of wings, anyway. You're right that the potential lifespan of a GW2 raid's relevance is much higher, but it's still relevance-per-account, given how legendary armor is made. It wouldn't be hard to put together an "expected time until reward value loss" across these games either, but I didn't want to tackle that here.
---
Riot Games.
---
What kind of an enterprise beast are you running?!
---
Maybe this is just a technical and decision debt that they always wanted to fix and now it also gives them bonus of not having power Chrono do a 60k opening burst?
---
I never understood _why_ do weird stuff with _channeling_ a signet and splitting functionality into start of channel/ end of channel where it clearly should just be an instacast or single cast action (with cast time if they _really_ want it to interrupt skill flow and be interruptable).
---
But then nobody ever wants to touch the code again given how incredibly brittle everything is, and we get this "extra skillful playstyle feature" because of initial mistakes of implementation (which became highly relevant only with Chrono cs )
---
To be fair, I think Blade and Soul destroyed Blade and Soul.
---
I'm only 2 months in, so a similar boat. The way I see it, if I'm enjoying the game I will contribute money as I see fit. If the game closes down I will be disappointed but not destroyed.
---
Just enjoy yourself :)

fractals give good value per hour esp. if you consider the ascended gear you get sometimes, doing dailys takes maybe 25-35 min with a decent group, it takes some time until you reach tier 4 tho
---
I said before pay to win and loot boxes how hard is that to understand? There was a time before they existed and games did manage to do ok.
---
Although there is rising costs in game development I get that, but lootboxes can’t be the only answer.
---
Hello RyzaSaiko, I hope you have a wonderful day!
---
Sounds fun, and thanks for the video.
---
I did find this for Reaper, I might look it as reference and decide if it fits my playstyle https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper_-_Power_Greatsword
---
Unless it only applies to shades that were alive at the start of the 3 second delay.
---
Then it can be a strong hit area denial without the control to guarantee the damage on any within shade cast range.
---
Hello gaspara112, I hope you have a wonderful day!

Was this necessary

Probably around next story patch, but it doesnt have to be.

They added that effect a few months ago.

warriors becoming somewhat rare in Fractals,in last month i just adding one more dps and its slower by inch. cc can brink basicly anyone with brain,or rock. wvw? who cares? take elite banner and kill downed ?

It becomes a turn-based game! :D

Any Improvements About 'ArcDPS + Build Templates + GW2 Radial' Combo?

REally nice event , thanks to all who came , and it still ongoing !

Congratz, way better than the Live-Ac... Let's not talk about that movie.
---
Lovely and Nice cosplay
---
Thats really sweet of you to ask; I do enjoy doing the train for fun!  However I am always in need of Ectos or Mystic coins if you do feel like donating :)
---
oh
---
i did. uploading the video now :)
---
It also applies around necro and that is a mobile AOE. Still a huge pain to balance that damage. 
---
Grossly underpowered? Did the last 3 years of instanced PvE pass you by? Mesmer has always been essential as support Chronomancer and doesn't really need to be an absolutely meta power DPS pick on top of crowding out condition damage alternatives. I'm sure it will get by just fine being broken with quickness and alacrity and through Mirage. 
---
I know it would be awsome if this was a guild but... all of them are me ^^
---
lol, right!
---
no please.... crafting ascendant gear doesnt take as much as people thing and crafting the cheapest one and turning it into a permanent stat swappable rune swappable gear negates all the hard work and effort placed into crafting their own legendary weapons.
---
Or doing raids, pvp and wvw for a legendary armor set.
---
Legendary gear isnt just a skin, the convenience and benefits of stat swapping is a big deal

So what are some real world benchmarks? I've seen dev say some good numbers, but what have you guys who use it seen? Marginal? Expected? Super? Extremely better gains?
---
&lt;3 You're all amazing &lt;3
---
We'll have to see the numbers, but it will probably still be a shadow of it's former self. The strength of the old trait really resulted from the fact that the gyros could pulse superspeed on 10+ people as they ran through it. A delayed effect hitting 5 people in an AoE radius won't be nearly as strong.
---
Oh, I wasnt talking about the DPS loss of the BS Warriors. Its more the loss of the Power and Condi DPS Builds, that depent on another warrior that is a BS, that Im worried about since the DPS of both variants is not bad (talking raids here) but raaaaarely used because there is always something better, more "meta". 
---
But yeah, since Im better with the hands on testing, than the theoriecrafting part.... I'll wait and see! =D

Having joined in 2014 (I believe after the festival had already concluded - or I was too new and clueless to realize it was going on, haha), I was completely blown away by the quality of 2018's Festival of the Four Winds. It was by far one of my favorite pieces of content I've experience in the game - beautifully designed environments with fun, engaging map mechanics. Loved all the little touches scattered around the map for us to discover - I always spent longer than I meant to wandering around the map, and kept uncovering new, fun little tidbits added in here and there. With each little feature I kept stumbling upon, I remember thinking many times how the map truly felt like a labor of love by the people who worked on it.
---
It reminded me of the first time I played in 2014, with the festival map evoking that feeling of wonder and exploration. Thank you for your work on it (and everything else!), and for reviving it for everyone to enjoy!
---
You only have two cats. While that desk is obviously big enough to hold at least 2 more. So your current setup is only at half potential. So I will give you a 5 out of 10 until you correct this grave error. 
---
I already stated I've been playing since vanilla and that not getting a content patch prior to Shadowbringers would surprise me. Content patches are just that. Content patches. You yourself claimed it as a the last major patch of an expansion therefore why would you not count it? It's just how they stylize their numbers. When it comes down to it the numbers don't dictate content. The release of content does it. 
---
CAT
---
Puuuurfect!
---
Well for one if you didnt perma banned almost half your community for ridiculous things. I'm sure you would have been stable.
---
This is probably a combination of people who are already working on material help, and those with no connections to do so. Sometimes all you can do is say how much a person means to you, even if you can't really help, so you do.
---
I'll keep this in mind, thanks. Already got a full exotic zerker set for my chrono and I've saved all good exotic loot for the necro.
---
Anet has put their vast majority of resources in casual-only content. And gw2 isn't really doing all that hot either. If you think 2 fractal CMs and a few raids are the reason for 140 people getting laid off I have a bridge to sell you.
---
Crucible of Eternity Chest, Order of Whispers leggings, Human Cult. Tier 3 Hands and boots and Cabalist shoulders 
---
Thought this is bad? o.O
---
Want cinematic GW2? Just tape top and bottom of your display with black tape, and reduce culling until you're at precisely 25FPS.
---
If you want next-gen console experience on top of that, reduce resolution to 720p.
---
Dailies, exploration, maybe a few fractals or a dungeon. (if you can find a group)
---
That's not really a valid argument. Many people don't know much about tournament bracket styles. With a large international community like this it's not unreasonable to assume that there is some special requirements or even just language support needed for tournaments based in Switzerland.    
---
No one can be called stupid for things they've never had chance or reason to learn.
---
Swiss tournament? So Red team fights Blue team, and both keep their gold at Green team?
---
Can't say I disagree.
---
You could be right. The most important when you game is - obviously - your personal entertainment so if you’re reluctant by all means don’t buy it. 
---
I can’t pretend to know what exactly is going on at ncsoft lvl but I do believe that ANet will still deliver content for a year and a half. Imma gw2 veteran after all XD
---
If they cared and were just worried for the game, their critique would sound vastly different.
---
People on one of the threads call devs stuff like "incompetent morons" who just want to "have fun at work"(how terrible of them) and never care for community, **ever**.
---
Random redditors claim they are in guilds with devs, argued with devs about some "insider knowledge" all of sudden. They just come out of the woodworks after lay-offs.
---
Also the amount of people saying anet has straight up **lied** to us all these years to keep us buying gems. Literally false advertising.
---
Anet is suddenly; Worse than EA, no transparency ever, only replies to fluff, thinks us as childs and all other worse things ever.
---
When things go sour, sour people arrive for easy karma
---
I actually do that in order every day ^^ I might pass on istan but sometime I do ^^
---
Sorry, but there is a lot wrong with this. The other DPS meter had two version, one that was compliant and one that wasn't.  He was banned because of that version. At least that is what I remember from my head right now. About "crappy devs", they work a lot to bring both small (voice lines for NPCs when getting near) and big (new maps and story) features. You can not like the content they provide, but it's hard to argue that the quality of content is bad. About "nobody plays", well, the last earning reports were good, so it's hard for the player base to be small. Hope you find a game you like more and have more fun :)

It's like making games.

You need to make a massive number of imperfect versions before you arrive at a high quality final product.
---
I think you recommended somewhere to use more than 8gb ram, is that still valid? A friend uses it
---
for some time now with 8 and didn't really encounter problems. What is the current stance? 
---
Meep Beep motherfucker!
---
Well, Guardian is *the* class with by far the most access to aegis (and stability). It, like Chrono, has a lot of natural blocks and active defense baked in. 
---
Nonsense, I heard nothing but hope from the more reliable sources, aka lain-off devs - voluntarily or not - that don't let their emotions overwhelm them. It sucked that it had to happen, but business hireth people and business layeth people off. 
---
GW2 is still greenlit. The reorganisation that's now happening is meant to keep the game running. For me, that includes all established long-term plans. I'm sure that work already started on xpac 3, and Living Story won't end any time soon either, as the official blogpost promised that season 5 is still on track (although perhaps slightly delayed because of all this).
---

---
Yeah it should be kept in mind that even if it's not for a long duration, some power builds do apply a fair amount of conditions too. Holosmith in particular puts a lot out. Iboga pet on Druid applies confusion on its own too and most druids I know use Iboga too. 
---
*The Tower of Devcares.*
---
&gt; After latest news it just doesn't appear that future is bright for GW2
---
Why? The fact that Arenanet is now concentrating 100% on Guild Wars 2 rather than trying to do multiple other things is somehow a bad thing? That makes no sense at all.
---
&gt; I want playable Skritt.
---
Not going to happen. First, an additional race requires a ridiculous amount of work. Second, a Skritt, by definition, is stupid. They have intelligence only in groups.
---
Story journal &gt; Heart of Thorns
---
Amazing vocal!
---
plenty of tonics to look like a skritt around, why wait for a new expac /game? :)
---
Either "Achievements" or "Heart of Thorns" under "Story Journal".
---
That said, I think it's better to ask in map chat. There's a good chance that people doing Dragon's Stand still haven't done it. LA maybe work as well, although you may have to offer some coin to get more people interested. There's no real point for anyone that has done it to redo it, since it's just a tedious waste of time in an instance that might just bug out (not sure how it is by now but oh boy those early days...), and doesn't provide any proper reward for replaying it. 
---
That is not an easy task as sayed above and i'm not on it for now. 
---
The DPS isn't going to change, only the support aspects will be better. So you can test the DPS and then have a decent idea of what boons it will now give to 10 people (instead of 5ish).
---
Yeah this is garbage
---
Go play on the Chinese GW2 servers and stop trying to ruin ours.
---
I was going to give it a shot on my windows 10 laptop, however I get an error:

---
I notice you're not using Arcane Brilliance to blast the fields. If that's the case and you're running written in stone, why not use Signet of Restoration for your heal?
---
 "it was the key defining part of the rotation" is an exaggerration lol, chronomancer obviously still has a very unique rotation. I hate how much players overreact to changes.
---
Actually they were sidegrades in the betas of hot, but a lot of players complained that there new elite specs weren't stronger than the base skills so they buffed them. Players wanted elite specs to be better than full core specs, and they probably should considering you are already running 2 core traitlines in every build anyway.
---
The issue is that renegade can do great providing alacrity, but it cannot provide quickness. Conversely, firebrand, another good boon support, can provide quickness, but no alacrity. Chronic can provide both. The trade off is that you get more deeps with either fire or Rene than you do chronic (you can also run them as healers). However, with the way lfg is, it’s hard to make mix and match groups—ie it’s easier to look for two chronos than one it up to fire/Rene as things get complicated if you get one chronic then a fire, as fire is not complete without renegade. (I also forget whether fire and Rene can provide their relative buff ten man or only five man, the latter meaning you’d need four spots to do the same as two chronos).
---

Yeah, not defending that guy at all. It's just unreasonable to expect everyone to have thought about it and make a blanket statement implying they're all stupid. That post, though...that was something special.

Thanks for the answer. I will upgrade my ram. anyway soon but will try it out when I'm back home. Another thanks for the work you are doing. Greatly appreciated.

Yeah, with the Asia-Centric items in the gemstore, it does seem strange as to think it would not be on the table. There are Katanas and Nine-Tailed Fox mounts for example! And they are really popular.

Many of the mechanics have sound cues, like the vg teleport mechanics, largos bubbles, when a special action key pops up, etc. Training yourself to listen for those frees up your eyes to look for other things.
---
Some really need to re-read Mike's statement cause he didn't say they're focusing 100% on gw2. And let's be honest, gw2 won't keep them in business forever.
---
It is usual to get a crash within the first ~20 minutes of using it while running around? Just wondering if it was because of shaders being built or something else.
---
Also, is it best to just be logged in to build shaders or do I need to go through zones and actually encounter things to make that happen?
---
Well&gt;Well&gt;Something else&gt;SoI&gt;back to DPS. It doesn't really bother me.
---
I picked the mesmer up in about October so never did the chrono tank thing and never acted as boon sow for a squad. People referring to it as jail and complaining about the expensive gear and hard rotation made me spec as mirage and I felt like a goddamn superhero. The internet made it seem like it was only played by martyrs who took up the spec for the greater good, but I know that's just a vocal minority. I actually like it
---
The changes to Signet of Ether will be interesting and I'm not really sure how it'll impact gameplay, but I image it'll be Fart out illusions&gt;SoE&gt;Something else&gt;Fart out more illusions&gt; go back to DPS

And no, I won't "shut my damn mount." You're not my mother.

The old way was left behind *FOR A REASON*. They even told you the reason back when they made the decision to move away from it. Yet here you are, wanting to go back to it despite that reason, trying to tell me to be quiet because I flatly disagree with the entire premise and you don't want to hear it.
---
If I don't support even a tiny speck of something, what else is there to do but shoot it down? Try to say "oh well maybe they could do this" even though I think it's a terrible idea? No.
---
It's a question!
---
You generally overheal as a druid anyways so there should be enough healing that will overflow and hit the spirits.
---
I hope Anet hires you so they can lay you off for being such a twat. Fuck off.
---
Maybe so.
---
I was thinking Eye Of The Storm from the late City of Hero’s Staff Mastery power set.
---
I kind of hope /u/RareEfficiency got laid off
---
No, I am just saying that you have no feedback for correct gameplay. You just play assuming everything goes right, while any other role sees if they are playing correctly.
---
Congrats.
---
But... did they really skimp out on printing the letter in colour ink?
---
Nope you cant.
---
Coming to talk of buying:    
---
the cheapest option is currently the 
---
standard edition for €29,99, which comes with the *Path of Fire* extension. 
---
How desirable is *Heart of Thorns*, compared to *PoF*?  Are gliders better than mounts?  Or the advanced professions?  The story?
---
CS is enough feast-or-famine time sensitivity in a rotation, Chrono doesn't need this interaction to feel good about pulling off timings well. 
---
because it's the kind of question only an asshole would ask, the fact that i need to explain this means you're either a stupid asshole or a troll (aka a stupid asshole)
---
I'd have a tough time staying with the zerg with those 2 cuties in front of me. 12/10 setup though!
---
Same here. Nothing more annoying then accidentally picking up some meat shield's stick in an open world PVE event and not realize it until I go to attack a monster.
---
Well done. I'll watch that from a computer tomorow. Very small on a phone but i'm glad someone recorded these moments. &lt;3

i really do appreciate all your work on this, but i can't help but wish this was vulkan. :( would make me running GW2 under Linux so much easier.
---
why not try and make it a guild? I'm sure some ppl would be into it. I recall someone in Divinity looking for a cosplay guild
---
But it isn't answering the question, I was asking who you hope is among the 100.
---
I’m seeing at least 6 cats worth of unused space. Two empty spaces in the front, one on the keyboard, one on top of the monitor - because cats are like 80% magic and can defy gravity - one on your lap and one on your head. This post assumes you do not currently have a cat on your lap and head during the taking of this picture. 
---
Yeah I understand that, not saying it's in a bad place. It's just stale. I'm a DH main and we've had the same rotation since raids started, pretty much. Even after torch changed to focus, it was even the same buttons, lol. 
---
I'm looking for something more along the lines of the spirit weapon rework a while back. Something that changes how it works or brings in more varied viable utility skills. Something that changes the rotation, like a new weapon being great (like sword or longbow), etc.
---
Thank you everyone for your suggestions!
---
Very awesome, and just noticed that in the third screenshot you can see the sheet music glider has a clef on the bottom.  Nifty!
---
That's me. Although I stopped wearing the shirt ever since the tea incident. Happy to run into ya again.
---
Why? I ask a question and you hope I get hired and fired lol. 
---
Is there a preferred place / method to report bugs and crashes along with system specs?

nobody, because i'm not the type off asshole that want's ppl to lose their job for inconveniencing me in a video game

I think that gw2 have this LUT shader already =]
---
My static has been playing a very off-meta comp with: power herald (10man might, fury, prot, swiftness), 1 quickbrand (viper or seraph), 1 tank healfb (minstrel/giver), 1 alacrigade (harrier).
---
DPS was definitely better than any 2 healer, 2 chrono comp. Thing is... and why Im not gonna post logs... ofc its a 2 healer comp. So any 2 div/bers chrono + 1 druid comp has more dps.
---
But, considering 99% of the raidcommunity actually wants - or honestly SHOULD - play with 2 healers... then fb/ren is just better. You just have to let go of druid completely then, because you need the boon extension from herald.
---
In short: Fb/ren comps (with herald) are for pugs/mid level statics. Chronos+Druid comps are for speedclearers.
---
Dude whats the problem?
---
Solid 8, could do with more cats though. Death by kitty cat golem!
---
It's a phone app called You Cam Makeup. 
---
Is he? they can't keep up the LS release cadence since he was appointed. Other areas of the game haven't improved.
---
This might be a hot take, but is there really any need to balance around pvp in cases like chrono? Yeah the build was really strong but it’s not exactly easy to play/isn’t the only build you would then run.
---
People were enjoying raids before the chrono nerfs. Why ruin that fun by making unwanted changes in a non-competitive game mode?
---
Only love for the devs not let go right
---
question for the anglospherics here: is noon a specific time? like 12 o'clock? because while I as a europoor really appreciate the UTC offset (not many US devs do this sadly) I'm a little baffled by the "noon".
---
Other races? Chance is near bottom. Too much to work.
---
well i appreciate your thought on the matter, regardless.
---
and again, thanks for all your hardwork. these are the kinds of upgrades GW2 needs at this point to help it stay relevant and improve performance.
---
Isn't he just describing how it works
---
Tirzah, I always love your maps, do more!
---
Where is the mouse ? Oh wait....
---
Now the real game begins
---
Noon means 12 in the afternoon, so in this case it's 12 pm PST, or 8 pm UTC.
---
Could you ss how it looked when you browsed it? 
---
Don't they earn enough from all the sales to do it? 
---
Well then they are second alongside Sylvari. I say it is nice. 
---
If RTX shadow calculations do anything, it's not improving FPS.

Hello, fellow Istan farmer! I see that my active chatter/occasional comm isn't the only regular cat here! (I'm not a furry, my main, Ashai The Silent, is a charr)

Based on the e-mail, she works for another company. I'm sure she's fine.
---
Currently GW2 SCT cannot show cooldown expiration or buff/debuff application/removal. All of those data is not visible directly for users with a unmodded client and as such would surely be taken down by anet soon. This is also the reason why such data is not accessable through the interface provided by ArcDPS.  
---
However, if anet liftens their rule about game client modification in the future, I would love to add such features and also maybe overhaul party/raid UI.
---
I have said 'one of the most played' not the most played.
---
Oh, it was funny while it lasted. I told them 'this is recs', and they got obnoxious about me not wanting to counterplay this instability (how would you even begin to do that beyond just bursting enemies down, I don't know) and started tagging me going all 'if this is recs why are you tagging stuff?'
---
Then we got to the boss and cleared it easily, I pointed it out, they got pissed and gave me a middle finger while proceeding to call me a prick despite their logic being super wrong. Oh, and they tried to kick me twice. Eventually the other PUGs got tired and kicked them just before Mai Trin spawned. Happy days!
---
I was there :). Lovely map instance, many nice ppl. We shared some stories and had nice chat.
---
&gt; Most Non-MMO PvE games you don't play for well over 200-300 hours.
---
Playing ARK rn and i won't be getting bored for a loooong time, the actual dedicated players put in thousands of hours, not the ones that try it and quit.
---
I can play mount and blades SP over and over.
---
I know people that have thousands of hours in Skyrim or Total War games too.
---
co-op games also exist.
---
Me no want berbs. Me want Skritt. Shiny.
---
Oh trust me, they were worse. Way, way worse.
---
True Shot: This skill's range has been increased from 1,200 to 1,500 
---
They simple increased the range from 1200 to 1500  ( you can hit a farther target) 
---
No contest from me, you are right. Time/cost it is easier to just pump more humans of different flavors. But I guess players would like the unique ones. At least I would like me some Skritt.
---
oh my god this is cringey
---
I feel your pain! I finally got full Minstrels and then BAM! Go get Diviners! Talk about expensive. No more Chrono in raids. I've also only been playing a year so getting full ascended Minstrels took some effort. I'm not changing the armor and weapons and getting new trinkets for Diviners. Warclaw here I come!
---
It's super easy and makes about 20 gold / hour. But that's assuming you have decent magic find and use a bag opener character at lvl 50-ish.
---
When was this?
---
0 mouse / 2 cats
---
Magic from the Searing still has some after effects
---
If your guard is having trouble upkeeping might then the problem is his not the game.
---
I never have trouble with it.
---
If they would reduce the damage of the auto by 10% but also reduce the cast time to 1/2 second the dps would actually be quite decent with more of the burst being focused on predictable stuff.
---
It would also be nice if they would toss some burning on it somewhere since that burst is still low. (DH is great for burns since it can be traited to apply cover conditions passively)
---
You call that high ping 😄 Cries in Oceania ping
---
What is cup? 
---
&gt; Ark got frequent content updates (similar to how an MMO gets them) as well as DLC expansions (heck they were making xpacs during the games early access). The game is also not solely PvE, its i mixture of PvE and PvP. And finally, the game is once again a sandbox game, simply put, not everyone likes sandbox games.
---
I don't own any of them, i don't play PvP in it and also what is wrong with sandbox? It allows infinite replayability.
---
&gt;There are certainly games that people play a ton, Mount and blade is one of them which based off steam metrics has an average playtime of 60-230 hours from those that beat the game.
---
Beat the game? It is sandbox and people play many playthroughs.
---
&gt;And total war... that type of gameplay woudln't really translate to a full MMO, it's a turn base strategy game,
---
What? It is not turn based.
---
&gt;and once again still gets frequent DLC updates, so yes people still get bored with it.
---
Simply not true? Many just play one of the games, my friend has a few thousand hours in Shogun 2.
---
&gt;And ocne again using Steam Metrics at least the average player doesn't have that many hours into the game.
---
Most poeple buy a game and barely play it, if you count everyone that tried Gw2 for 30 mins and then quit it you would get the same times.
---
&gt;trying to clock in those hours with literally the same content over and over and still have that appeal to your entire audience... that doesn't work. This is why MMO's generally need updates.
---
Most of my 1k plus hours are in WvW, the mode of amazing updates :v
---
yes you can, but there probably won't be much performance improvement. GW2's stock shaders are pretty lightweight.
---
i don't know if d912pxy can load custom textures.
---
Wait what?

Needs more cats
