I have one yes. But it seems like I ended up missing something anyway.

If people are kicking you in lower level dungeons they probably aren't very good themselves tbh
---
I think I really have to learn chrono again from 0. I didn't keep up with the changes in december and support chrono was just dead for me since then.
---
I fell off the platform and couldn't get back but my flesh golem (with the help of some NPCs) decided to finish the fight on its own. Didn't catch the full thing on video but I spent pretty much the last 20% of the boss just standing there https://streamable.com/fgq78

Please provide a definition of what "condi" is and then sticky this thread.
---
Depends on your definition of valuable, and Ive typically had much more luck finding a healer than a chrono.

Past that, practice practice practice
---
That's because the average player goes DPS and doesn't support or do mechanics and so even with LI may be completely inexperienced and might not even know how it works.
---
I mean it's a lot easier in terms of basic rotation.

So a week of trading ?

If your email matches the GW2 account, then you could always create a new account and reach out to support and tell them you can't reset the password on your actual account. It seems obvious, but also check your Spam folder in case the reset landed there. I'm not sure why you would need your Serial Number; as long as your account's billing information matches up with you, ArenaNet should be able to help. The only reason I could think of them getting rid of an account is if fraud was involved.
---
The people that look at Chrono support DPS are silly, for the most part.

Especially in PUGs.

Submit an anonymous ticket here with as much information as you can remember.  You'll get an email confirming they received your request and get back to you in a few days.  Support will work with you to confirm account ownership, hopefully unlocking it quickly.

Give as much information as you possibly can to them regarding your account. If you can't find your serial code, then you just need to prove authenticity, and they'll do what they can.

Oh too many times lol. The random 1.4k ping strikes again. Skills start flashing, oh what a glorious day.
---
&gt;There are plenty of People with 250+ or even 500+ li's that are just trash and die on easy bosses. Not to mention that gw2 raids themselves are piss easy. 
---
Yeaaa, unfortunately similar experience here. 
---
Idea: Play WvW
---
Literally all I do in the game now is roam or solo things unless someone I know is on.
---
It's disgusting to play with people who just constantly die, hell, even when doing Dhuum CM with "exp people" for the first time and getting to 10%, people start panicking like idiots, freeze up and die to the poison, not even the ender. Really?
---
Not nerdy enough fro the JoJo reference
---
I myself prefer LGBTQTTGUIDFRTASCV
---
type:  /wiki something       to search for something on the wiki. replace the word something in the example to anything you want. I type random stuff must to open browser half the time.
---
Being under level 80 defs doesn't help you... + not having a proper set to handle fights in WvW. Most people that run around WvW now are maxed out and have builds that shred through just about anything (such as myself.) 
---
I'd say take it slowly, re-familiarize yourself with a class (or both..) and make sure you actually read and understand the skills you choose to use. Just go one-by-one. Maybe for now you can run around with zergs/ commanders and support them + deal damage from a distance. Up to you what you wanna do! Having a good time is priority #1 B)
---
I want staff to get reworked into a good ranged power weapon for pve...the scythe animation is so cool.
---
Yeah that's why I avoid melee deimos unless in a static (and fear Dhuum in case green pugs don't talk about their ping)
---
Well then.
---
Do what these guys said. I went through the same process months ago. Support was helpful , it took quite a few emails back and forth , but I got my account back.
---
Tfw coming top DPS with exotic gear and no one knowing or even better, actually completing the raid reasonably well with green gear without anyone realising. Ahh the puglife.
---
At a min I'd log in daily, craft my ascended time gated materials.. turn them into finished products (e.g. deldrimor steel).. and slow sell on auction hours (only every slow buy materials for crafting too).  EAAASY money
---
I'd full clear harvesting season 3 for currencies fast (easy to do if you are used to it), consume them all, then buy magic warped bundles (for clovers and materials).. I'd do some istan and buy trophy caches with the magic too.
---
Do RIBA for maybe 2 hours every other day.. always move all bags to a level 49 before opening, sell valuable stuff, salvage the rest.
---
SELL ABSOLUTELY ALL MATS you have saved up that you do not need, slow sell!  They are useless in storage and could be a legendary now!
---
I maybe logged 10-15 hours of hard farming, tops.
---
The daily login for crafting ascended materials is the easiest money for sure.  Also make a charged quartz.. can turn it into a Ley-Line Infused Tool to sell.
---
Meaning that most Content can decently easily be done without a chrono, but not without a healer. Also a Chrono is wasted if the rest of your group is bad. Chrono’s in a lot of places are for min maxing, where trying to do certain content without a healer becomes frustratingly difficult.
---
In addition to what others have said, ask in WvW-mapchat for your servers Teamspeak/Discord and join it. Callouts from the commander help with keeping awareness in fights.
---
You can progress in:
---
+ wealth (gold, account unlocks)
---
+ skill (performing better than X percentage of players, you can expand horizontally into different classes and builds too, for breadth if desired)
---
+ knowledge (how much of the game do you understand and can explain)
---
+ content (how much of the game have you experienced/seen)
---
+ prestige (how many fancy show-it-off items you might have accrued, e.g. legendaries, auras, thrones, titles, AP, etc.)
---
The only thing GW2 doesn’t have is the easy to fall back on method of increasing numbers on your clothes in order to progress in performance.
---
Damnn buddy, just saw this. You and these corner skips! I gotta try this out.
---
I have enormous amounts of hate towards that corner
---
Wow this is a lot of great information, I'll dig into researching everything little bit more first then. Thank you!
---
And nobody wants to start like that so comm keeps calling gg, and then finally at the fifth pull neither of those two idiots gets hit by the slam, but YOU get hit by it instead because you're so checked out, and then suddenly there is nothing left in your life but contempt for all things.
---
Ok forsure, thank you. Ill take a look at Daredevil and revenants. Thank you again for the great info!
---
Holy shit its like you don't even realise how toxic you are. Glad you got banned, please don't come back.
---
Light is the best because it has the most variety. It's almost overwhelming. 
---
Medium is the worst because it's 98% Trench Coats. Give us some regular leather jackets / vests already FFS.
---
Read some of the responses of op. He is absolutely toxic yet denies it. Clearly someone who needs to grow up.
---
Soulbeast overall is pretty much just a stronger dps version of core ranger, using a bow or not. The fact that people tend to play soulbeast as a melee dps class in PvE is not a problem with soulbeast, but more a fact of the overall meta of the game heavily favoring stacking players on top of each other.
---
Longbow as a ranger PvE option is...less desired because it doesn't have quite the same DPS to match other options, and you lose out on boons and other buffs that your party can give you at close range.
---
Years ago you could buy instances from other people, kind of cheapens the achievement hence i never bothered with the blue one.
---
Worth noting that it only looks like that when the floor is covered in mirrors, which happens rarely during some art expositions
---
The mobs respawn so you could just repeatedly kill the same one until you have enough keys.
---
Love the b&amp;w style.  And she's almost identical to my necro, same hair and similar clothes
---
I hope we get more diversity in tanking options.
---
Staff is shit weapon and so is lich form.
---
thats a weird looking asura
---
Longbow+dmg modifier needs to be nerfed first.
---
This reference is lit like the Notre Dame Cathedral
---
Stop asking for bs 60 dhuum kp then. Playerbase is not that big that people with high experience will be playing at all times. Seen people ask for 500li+dhuum kp for w1 lol. I dont understand some people in raid community, they ask for such high experience and are dogshit at doing their own job. I think people accepted the 50kp+250li as a norm which is idiotic. I would understand if it is dhuum for example but for w1-4 it doesnt make a fuckin sense because its literally free.
---
Why do you enjoy your main class?, what is it about it that you enjoy? I'm really interested in hearing from people who do multiple things on one class ( open world / raids / wvw etc)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I'm basically trying to work out what class I want to main, years of being an altoholic mean I've got good base understanding on all the classes but I'm pretty terrible at the game overall, usually opting to play whatever the highest rated build on metabattle is and not actually learning what the class can do. I'm not fond of Engineer , revenant , elementalist and thief because of how they work mechanics wise and the limited amount of weapons choices on elementalist.
---
From a visual standpoint I'm drawn to mesmer and Guardian, but I don't want to play chronomancer in raids and guardian seems a little slow.
---
I mean, I wasn't on this sub at that time. I recently returned, just watched Aurene grow up in game, hopped onto this subreddit and saw this post and got spoiled. Felt bad to get spoiled and then told to "get over it" but life goes on I guess.
---
Is it worth it to get this device? I mostly visit Auric Basin to do Metas (tons of chests).
---
What's that?
---
JC... so potions is key. I've died like 30+ times in that ice room alone and is one of the biggest reasons why I've been putting off the achievement. I read old strats from 2 years ago, but I figured it was patched. I mean, I guess it was, just not for the potion.
---
whats the point if you can only ever do them once
---
So you find any of your dodge jump macros failing during these runs? For reference, my razer synapse macro has about a 60% success rate when executing the command.
---
Maybe sell price greater than 15% of the buy price is what you meant?
---
You can't compare a spec to a role. Chrono can be replaced by fb+renegade, healer can be almost everyone.
---
3 more pieces to go. T.T
---
Thank god im not the only one thinking this way!
---
Gorseval and Sloth seem really unfair.
---
VG and KC seem trivial.
---
Matthias and Sab sound fair.
---
Xera sounds really interesting.
---
You're absolutely correct and I'm having a hard time figuring out how you would fix that.
---
Thanks for information
---
[removed]
---
Well my point was that Quickness and/or Alacrity and/or Chrono Utilities are less pertinent to challenging content in the game than a dedicated healer is. 
---
That is to say, those things make content faster but not necessarily that much easier. Where as not having a healer makes some content nearly impossible. That is unless you stack classes that can easily heal themselves consistent (necro, thief, etc.)
---
It's because the "collection" to get it isn't really a collection.
---
It's just buy this,  craft this,  next. Boring and expensive. 
---
At least the other legendary collections are interesting.
---
Stockholm syndromes got u in a chokehold :o
---
Hey buddy! I had this same problem. I think it is Razer Synapse's newest version being buggy. I used an AutoHotkey press combined with synapse and it works 100% of the time now. I'd recommend trying a different macro program or scaling back your program.
---
Simply ask guild leaders what they expect from you, before joining a guild, that should solve your problem
---
I don't think it will fail without it. Literally all I said is that I wouldn't oppose it IF that meant they were releasing long lasting, great content - that is all. I never made any argument that it is the end all be all, I am just stating that I think the game and community is good enough that it would be worth a Sub model if that's what was being used to push more big solid content releases.
---
The inside of the Bifrost staff
---
I'm in the same predicament as that dude. I'd love Permanent bank access, but that aint cheap bruh. At the time of this post, the lowest sell order is 3,666 gold, and the highest buy order is 3,170.
---
I aint got that kind of gold. I *want* that kind of gold, but that's so expensive that I'd wouldn't want to slave away earning gold just to see it all vanish on one item. I'm not comfortable with any purchase that consumes more than one fourth of my net worth in a game. I want to still have earning power after the fact.
---
By comparison the awakened guy was cake.
---
We need more.
---
I could buy three more slots. But even if I did, I still can't fit all the teleport items, the converters, utility items, and gizmos.
---
I'm not sure if "hate" accurately captures the sentiment of the majority who have an opinion. Disappointed is probably more appropriate since there are many, me included, who feel it looks too similar to the Chaos skin.
---
I've come to realize it is pointless trying to explain the raison d'être of GW2 to people who have been hopelessly conditioned to be skinner box rats.
---
No. I left Runescape partly because they did this kind of “faction” system, but showed a clear bias in favor of certain factions. I also see complaints from Alliance players over in WoW who deal with the same thing. I’d rather not bring that here. Besides, we already have WVW.
---
"Be the change you want to see in the world"
---
Its perfectly understandable for people to want to be matched with players of similar experience, as well as them wanting a group setup that they deem to be most useful. Measuring that in something like LI or KP is just something that happened naturally, simply because its a simple and fast way for us to somehow measure the experience of our teammates.
---
That being said, when i lfg i never put requirements other than the roles needed - and this can be a giant hit and miss &amp; you meet all kinds of people. But honestly, i only do that because i know i have a bunch of capable guildmates on my side that are able to carry or lowman if needed. 
---
Not everyone has that. Not everyone is motivated to run into a bossfight, having 9 other people that potentially dont even know the mechanics of an encounter, not once having looked at a dps build or charging in sportsing soldier gear (Had a guardian like that once on VG. When we asked him to lower his toughness he started removing his trinkets), just to cherrypick the bad ones after 1-2 fails and put up a new lfg. Especially considering how quickly it happens for a squad to disband.
---
Idk whether you're on EU or NA, but from my experience the amount of training or "know mechanics" runs on EU is relatively high tho :)
---
cheers.
---
Captain here!  
---
He died.
---
I've had the same problem.  I found autohotkey works perfect for me using this script.
---
    SetBatchLines, -1
---
    SetKeyDelay, -1
---
    PgDn::
---
    Send V
---
    Send {Space}
---
You can change the keys to what you use.  V for me is dodge, and {Space} is jump.  PgDn is the key I press to activate dodge jump.
---
I agree to some extent. 
---
I do honestly think LFG is useless for raids. You'll see more raid selling than actual squads.
---
But I highly support the guild idea. There are some really amazing guilds with not just training statics, but also progression squads which is as they get better they advance eventually becoming static groups of people that are fully trained and wiping wings with no problems every week together.
---
Before I knew about the guild system, some time ago I would join few KP lenient pug groups from LFG. I was fully meta prepped. But everytime it was disaster. 0 kills. While you give a lot of reasons why LFG could work without LI and KP I saw many why it wouldn't. People don't pull their weight, do you like spending 2+hrs getting nothing out of it? Rage quitting, bad damage, wrong gear, unawareness of class/skill/traits, completely oblivious of boss tactics, squads fall apart one after the other. You say raids are easy, please drop in 10 random people who have no clue at let's say Xera. I love dungeons by the way, but they are not easy for new people, but the fact that you need 10 people for raids and some bosses one mistake will cost all lives. Also KP and LI is not a guarantee but like filter where you have a lower chance of failure because raids are long and in the end you don't want to be there so long you become a part of the interior design.
---
I don't know how pro you are but I don't think raids are easy, sure some bosses are of course, but if you trained people you are aware how long and hard at first it is for so many people get in sync. 
---
Overall even if people have LI and KP required LFG is not the best idea. I watched my boyfriend spend hours with experienced pug groups achieve barely anything somedays. He's much happier in a raid guild. But even experienced static guild squads quit after few hours trying on some boss because it's just not flowing. I think the fact that there is so much time possible to waste people are frustrated to a point they'd rather "filter out" a certain amount of community to decrease a certain percent in chances of failure.
---
So in the end I do think LFG is bad, I do think that a certain amount could be improved, although in the end where there's people there's gonna be certain level of toxicity. At that moment, though, in my opinion the other alternative is great and I'm quite happy with the raid guild community.
---
Waka's isnt on her outfit, but she legit cucks him and leaves him in the novel that takes place after X-2... &gt;!Alongside the implied necrophilia, bestiality and Tidus being a zombie. It gets really weird.. but yeah, you challenged it! !&lt;

Why do people continue to make these silly threads. Every single one of them just gets exposed and embarrassed by an ANET employee for being full of it.

If you look in the LFG(Y by default) you can sometimes find Hero Point trains. This will give you experience for your masteries and unlock your specialization.

That’s damn near what it would take.

To everyone saying that the reason why LFG culture is the way it is, is because new players don't put in the effort to be at the minimum level, I'm pretty sure that's correct. New players that just want to leech like it's open world are in the wrong. But I also agree with OP when he says that people that run groups to exclude others in LFG are also in the wrong. It's just going to end up being a loop where, a couple years down the line, I wouldn't be surprised if raid LFG really was as bad as he says.
---
It would definitely be nice if an effort was put in to teach newer players in the same way that you'd teach a newer player a dungeon if you ran into a new player there. And it'd definitely be healthy for the game mode.
---
I got into this game just trying to 100% maps and had a blast. The story was cool, not epic, but it grew on me.
---
Guild drama can suck, but you can solo the story.
---
I think it's a great game overall though.
---
Yup, welcome to [10 months ago...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8osnwq/while_were_on_wvw_we_need_to_talk_about_something/)
---
It needs to be one way or another. Either everything is literal or everything is unique.
---
Another (free) option is to enter PvP/WvW and use the services there. You return to your previous PVE position when exiting the game mode.

I'll be the first to admit I was an absolute 100% hater of Pharus when I first saw the picture of it before it was released - because it looked like Azureflame and Chaos Longbow combined, but when I actually saw it on YouTube from other players, up close, it looked quite different. So much so I could imagine what would look well with it, and, ultimately, I made Pharus for my ranger XD no regrets.

A build with a "burst" on 30sec CD that could be absorb, reflect, block... With mediocre damage the rest of time... This build work on people that didn't know how to play like old Charge + 100blades Warrior combo. This build is just plain bad vs good players.

warlocks were stupid easy and op in legion, especially affl was a joke with ring and drain as filler, it's very nice they gutted that
---
Look up [Guides](https://discretize.eu/guides) for Fractals etc.
---
Train your dps rotation at the Golem until you reach at least around 30k.
---
Then try to deal as much dps in real encounters without dieing like a scrub. Just join T4s and get your ass kicked as long as you need to, getting flames by teammates is also added benefit.

gitgud

It also unlocks the WP in the map the meta is going on on any character that hasn't been there before.  So there is also that.
---
I feel the opposite, I really hate when they come up with weird names for straightforward concepts. Plain language makes these things much easier to keep track of, especially for new or returning players.
---
Dead game mode. No Australian presence.
---
Actually, they didn't implement trinity system into the game. They just open up the Support option that classes can bring. People see that has trinity but there isn't any trinity gameplay mechanic ( healer wasn't needed, tank rarelly necessary and no tank mechanic like threat).
---
IMO that's the amazing things about GW2. Every classes does nearly everything we need to do in all theres way and it's us has players to match all that to get composition. Sure meta created by players would always left some classes aside but it's the cases on other MMO too. It's even more true when you balance 3 game modes with 9 classes that have 10+ differents builds available. Sure this build, in this game mode would be less efficient but it work better somewhere else... Maybe you just need to adapt your build for the game mode. ;)
---
Thanks for the write up! Just had one more question. Is it possible to get full ascended or even legendary gear strictly through solo farming and outdoor group content like world bosses, etc?
---
Snaff didnt die for this
---
I would have wanted this wall of text as a noob. It's hard to pick it up from the scraps you get elsewhere.

I'm in the process of making it. I love it &lt;3
---
I've take a quick look at it, but haven't found about the "deposit all" system that is sooo great. Salvage all is good too but i don't think it is that important at the beginning
---
Didn’t the game breaker e-magazine go under?
---
I believe so, if you activated a few strategic infantile clouds. Where are you stuck at? Depending on that, getting back might be just as difficult as running the whole thing again, at least if you don't know where you are missing one.
---
Nope. They stay just as big. It’s too big for an Asuran to weld.

You can make it so you are done clicking tomes in a minute, clicking those level up notifications is worse

99% of the time if it's a percentage it's the damage type. If it's a number it's the stat.
---
I've been looking at /r/guildrecruitment   a lot and 95% of guilds recruiting require raid experience and or LI. Why gatekeep "easy" content so hard??
---
I loved that show. Didn't Gamebreaker have financial problems or something?
---
The exact means are up to personal preference on this one, I have seen peopel join squad then ask then ping, people ask in PM after joining (to secure the slot), people PM before joining the suqad. SO it's whatever anybody finds better at this time imo.
---
Congratz ! Even if it became "easy" for few people, it's important to spread the word when somebody reach the end ! Bravo !

* Itzel Bounce Mushrooms

* Nuhoch Wallows

* Max Iztel for Andreal Mushrooms (instant refresh all skills) is very useful for doing the METAs.

* You can Max Exalted stuff last. Weakest of the lines.

It can be either one. Quickbrand + Healgade has higher dps compared to Healbrand + Alacritygade but the later one has a better kit for healing.
---
For casual runs Healbrand + Alacritygade is smoother
---
Sea of Sorrows has one of the largest Oceanic WvW populations in GW2. Some big guilds operate around that time. (Ore) (Zeal) (SoX) are three of the big active guilds that play very often with great communities.

Do you remember roughly an old rotation you were using with 2 Wells some time ago? Well we have gone full circle and back to that (give or take the timing of the first SoI of the fight/big phase).

Games as a service is so fun man!

I never looked on the dps as support :D

2. If you’re fine with timegated materials (about a month for a whole set of armor) and have the right crafting discipline at 500, crafting is relatively easy if you’re just transmuting the prefix anyway

Fellow Aussie here on Dragon Brand. I only play between 5pm-11pm, this is also our server's peak time even compared to NA. Our NA is horrible, so I barely log in NA prime. I believe theres a guild on DragonBrand called [SLAP] and a see guild [COLT] that plays during prime Aussie time.
---
People keep wanting this, but do people actually have any solutions as to HOW it should last longer? By adding grind? That as already been done in plenty of episodes with collections and skins.
---
A bunch!
---
[Take a look at this](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers). Mainly it's just another Living Story episode (or two if it's been longer), and a few of balance updates that I suggest taking a look at.
---
Last two LW eps have been a bunch of fun.
---
&gt;The last map was huge but there wasn't any content left to do after finishing most of the achievements.
---
So after everything is done there is nothing to do? Isn't that always the case, regardless of how big something is?
---
LFG is not a place to learn your first raid. Period.   
---
1. Not everyone who uses the LFG can commit 2 hours on a single encounter. Most people use the LFG to skip the hassle and long hours of forming groups to get quick fillers for a quick kill. That said, the expectation of a boss kill is 30 minutes or less before PUGs start to flake and drop off.
---
2. As a commander, I am responsible for my group member's time and enjoyment. There is a clear distinction between a clear run and a training run. There is a higher pressure to get a full wing clear within a certain time constraint (for loots/efficiency) than for a training run where much more time is allowed in order for the trainees to absorb their knowledge. The KP requirement is there for a reason: as proof of literacy and kill experience - so I'm not wasting my time to quiz the pug subjects or I'm expecting to train/carry some strangers for their first kills.
---
3. I pug enough to be able to tell during the first pull who can and cannot do the mechanics and pull their weight. So what would you prefer? Getting high entry requirement, or getting kicked on low performance without a warning? Myself, the latter is a waste of my time for both re-LFG and the post-kick drama.
---
4. Raids are only easy when everyone fulfills their role. The more clueless people you have in the group, the less chance you have at killing the boss. There are no ways you can prove some random strangers on the LFG having the right gears, builds, and rotations before a pull. This beautiful example is taken from my in-guild raid training: [https://dps.report/dBKq-20190414-172032\_sab](https://dps.report/dBKq-20190414-172032_sab) We were extremely lenient to the newbies, having asked only good gears and good builds and putting them on easy no-mechanics DPS-only jobs. And that DPS log is the best pull out of 2 hours of "training". To be fair, it's not much different from some casual weekend pugs, maybe except for the salt and frustration of not getting anywhere.  
---
So how should a beginner breaks into raids:
---
1. Join a friend's. Make friends and get recommended by a friend.
---
2. Join a training/progression group. Respect their requirement and regulations. Be punctual, assertive and positive.
---
3. Join an organization that provides raid trainings. Guilds do offer in-house raid trainings/clearing. So do multiple raid training discord.
---
4. Make your own group and LFG for Training/Practice/Progression. AkA. Setting a clear expectation of learning. Depending on the encounters, some nice experienced guys and gals will drop by to help out or it could take infinity to fill out a group (\*cough\* dhuum \*cough\*), which leads to
---
5. Any combinations of the aforementioned methods.
---
It would be nice if we got more than 1 armor set every 5 episodes. Like armor sets that come from new dungeons, raids, or drops from mobs in each new zone. Or maybe multiple mount skins per episode to earn in game from different activities like finishing a long questline.
---
Alrighy thank you, but where does Ancient Magic fit in? After Adrenal Mushrooms?
---
I didn't play in a while, looking to get back in, is condi scourge/mirage still viable or is everything power?
---
Just spam jump when you jump and collide with the wall. Some walls/edges/corners for some reason have better chances than others. Although experimenting with the angle and distance of when you jump into said wall can influence success rates. So just keep playing around with it.
---
Praise dulfy!
---
Those god damn fingers ... after all those years doing Tribulation mode at least once for the achievement those damn fingers still get me every damn time. I even know they are coming which makes that even worse.
---
dude chrono-jail is nothing. Druid-jail is where it's at.
---
Probably generaly an unpopular opinion, but i aggree completely with you. TD is awesome and they should make more maps styled that way.
---
i see theres a spell use to be an effect on stage. this is serious work right here.
---
Draconis was pretty good. And I know the backpiece was just a timegate, but still.
---
Would you believe this was pretty spontaneous? Haha first it was just 2 Guys dancing then they asked more people to join in...and this was the end result.
---
&gt; I just want a map that brings me back to it even if I finish the achievements related to it.
---
You mean like Istan meta and the new Shatterer worldboss?
---
How much you save crafting these? Is It even worth the time
---
Having an unofficial Australian server for wvw is incredibly destructive for ppt and coverage balance. You're effectively stacking in a time zone where you'll rarely be matched, which also has huge influence over matchups for all other time zones.
---
This is the result of servers and coverage not being balanced. Australians have more impact on ppt per player than na prime players. Yet despite higher impact per player, much larger population inequalities are common.
---
Tell anet to fix their view on ppt and coverage, because even alliances and forming an Australian alliance currently will not fix this.
---
&gt;It is true that there is a large number of coats, but there is also a good number of non-coat skins and I actually like coats for the most part.
---
Three isn't a good number. PvP set, WvW set, and the Strider gemstore set.
---
TD is really interesting design, but the problem is that navigating it is unrewarding beyond initial curiosity. Lots of books and crannies and hidden pockets, but nothing worth going into those areas for.
---
So while I appreciate the level design that can go into that kind of thing, it also has to be worth exploring. I think an interesting approach would be to have "shortcuts" of sorts tucked away in a map where waypoints can often become disabled or just don't exist, but I'm not sure what the right way of implementing that would be.
---
If I had to guess, the new map will have a lot of vertical travel to showcase the new mount we're getting and probably some collection achievement to incentivize exploring.
---
I dont assume they do it to make us angry. I'm sure they do it to leech loot and get things easy because they're bad and entitled leeches.
---
Unfortunately their behavior being awful towards any groups that dont cater to them is toxic. It only leads to groups moving servers and or not playing with them or doing whatever it takes to avoid these players.
---
All of these become increasingly more common in both EU and NA. You cry the gamemode is for pugs but these entitled pugs rely on comms and guilds that run communities and allow them to follow.
---
I'll gladly teach comms various ways of getting rid of players with the attitude you support. I'm sure you stand behind it fully but it's terrible for any non pugs on your server.
---
I feel like pre-nerf istan would've been the perfect example of what I've wanted. They shouldn't have nerfed the repetitive aspect of it.
---
You hate it from begining but you will find a way to love it later. Take a look on any other map. Take a look how they were made. LA started as flat plains and from there it was build. Adding mountains and building. TD was made the other way around. You had a flat plains but then they were digging down into the dround making twisting tunels and caves. Thats why this map is so rare and enjoyable. The only other map like this is Grove, wich is a lovely map, but you have nothing to do there. Thats why I hope for another map where you would start up and go underground into a cave systems and tunels.
---
Doesn't look much like an asura for me
---
On a related note: could a veteran chime in with some tips for food/utilities for other builds with some rough explanations of why they're popular?
---
That is quality.... entertainment
---
Thanks, but what is BLTC lists? got a link?
---
Alternate Option: 
---
&gt;I dont care bye lol
---
You can skip any part of the following list that you want, but if you want to smooth the way for yourself: do POF for the mount/HoT for the glider, find a hp train and unlock an elite spec of your choice, make sure your gear is up to date (check metabattle or snowcrows if you need some direction) and start doing dailies for the gold so you can pay for the basics.
---
Goddamn.. I can never do it in this lighting. Had to go full screen and turn up gamma.
---
I guess break stun still works hah
---
You dont seem very bright. You reeee all day that anyone can do whatever as long as they're pugs.
---
It's simple, if you expect to be treated nicely and play in a community where different play styles exist then you'll need to respect groups that aren't for you. Whether that is guild raids that are closed, public comms who want meta, or charr only raids is irrelevant.
---
By refusing to listen when it doesn't suit you, you are going to create tension between pugs and groups. This will lead to them leaving, toxicity, less diversity in play and so forth.
---
You.demand everyone to respect pugs yet refuse to respect anyone that doesn't cater to them as you wish. Keep in mind they are doing stuff autonomously and often do stuff for the server. You dont other than provide a body at best.
---
Seen this time and time again on various servers both on na and EU. Your servers rely on guild players, commanders, communities enjoying themselves. And these are in short supply.
---
If you make it impossible for them to have fun because reeee gamemode is for only pug style play cant stop me, dont cry if the guilds rather make their own servers without you or move every link. 
---
In my experience the players that follow whatever are the first to quit when comms and guilds stop tagging or leave. Or become full toxic. 
---
And personally I do recommend comms to be toxic. You have a huge surplus of pugs on EU prime and na prime compared to.commanders. the comms can afford to replace players with people they like better. You cannot because there are rarely several comms willing to deal with entitled casuals reeee'ing in gw2.
---
&gt; If you're inexperienced, you have a couple of options, join the training guilds (which in my experience was a waste of time getting a kill, but it was nice to be able to see the bosses mechanics in action instead of in a video), have a friend/group of friends that'll take them in with them, make their own group.
---
And that's the issue. Joining a training guild and/or watching videos and practicing rotations should be the base of the base, we shouldn't even have to say it.
---
One can understand KP faking if one has not enough experience (LI/KP) on a boss, but has practiced enough, knows his character, knows the mechanics.
---
But there are players that don't even do that first basic effort, and those are really detrimental for everyone.
---
Pharus being legendary we can expect it to have on hit effects. But what I am saying is that the effects are white light effect and some smoke. The Kudzu, Pharus' competitor, has flowers with different colors, grass and vines on its hit effects, and the weapon itself is incredibly detailed. 
---
One can say the effects reflect the theme of Pharus, given that its a weapon of light, but that still doesn't invalidate the effect having less details. What would have been cool and more detailed IMO is involving the metal bits from the weapon. So when Pharus crits, small metal pieces converge on the foe and shoot an orbital strike (like the one we have now).
---
First of all you should check your keybinds. A and D should be changed to strafe. Make sure the Dodge key is easily acessible. Later on in the game youll want the same for the action key.   
---
Some quality of life options can be turned of or on depending on personal  preferences . Things such as camera shake and field of view. You can also choose to make yellow interactables visible by default.
---
Why do that (new char) ? Join the fractal Thamanova Reactor and test your GS on the Asura.
---
Touché.
---
But when everyone will get notification on 10 minutes mark, if you go straight in, many will do at that point as well, so your map will get filled anyways...
---
Maybe try https://immortius.net.au/wardrobe-unlock-analyser/ ?
---
Be aware that's is not really flying per se, it's falling with style. Gravity will always catch you up, but you can delay it for quite some time using the mounts wisely. It's not stationary fly like in WoW.
---
I kinda think SAB deaths should have their own counter. They are going to overflow the normal counter soon enough.
---
You can always let people join and test them. If someone has 120 LI (when you're looking for 250+) and he's playing very well - so what's the problem? I understand that more LI = more raids done = experience, but not all players with lower LI are worse.
---
And yes, I seen players joining with i.e 80LI when squad said "150LI". Good to see nice people letting players join.
---
Just imagine if they introduced it within some bigger patch to all of those metas though :) Like, putting all of them on some timer, fixing bugs, maybe adding some more exclusive 10 000 gold minis (because those actual ones aren't rewardning enough), and such. Would be glorious.
---
i have an Asura based on Judy hopps, she looks like a rabbit.
---
gw2bltc.com , has a list functionality somewhere.
---
I have this same question whenever people ask me why I play Warframe.  
---
My answer: Space ninjas and I get to look fabulous being one.
---
Also worth to mention: many skills have synergy: like steal health if target is poisoned or deal x % more DMG if target is stunned
---
Before Adrenal Mushrooms. Problem is, Ancient Magic 5 is very much necessary for the LS3E5. Depends if you want to rush through season 3 or not.
---
Take at least Ancient Magic 1, or some bosses will kill you.
---
Thanks for this. It was overwhelming for me as new player. The game does a terrible job guiding noobs.
---
Repeatable content.  
---
* dungeons (repeatable story content with rewards?!)
---
* world bosses
---
* cool map wide metas
---
* new skins
---
* collections
---
Thank you! I will do my best (I know reddit’s search is a little finicky at the best of times!) I found the deposit minerals button a while ago (I’m in IT, I click on everything just to see what it does) but it’s good to know to remember to do it more often (please tell me the bags get bigger than four slots!). I will definitely look for the red bar next time! I also love that everyone has mentioned ranger, idk if it’s just because it’s popular or if that’s what everyone plays their first time around?
---
Uh, for greatsword, wouldn't it be mythril instead ?
---
Nice ideas. However, don't all w2 bosses and KC already have CMs, even if they're not called that ?
---
To some it’s not to others WVW is important. Super fun to play when you have a full guild kitted and ready to fuck up another server to show dominance lol 
---
But yeah to some it doesn’t matter
---
One can hardly teach new players all class synergies, but yeah ^^
---
Sorry what is key farm?
---
I won't be doing PVP and I have no idea what wvw is. My only MMORPG knowledge comes from an anime called Log Horizon.
---
Oh yes the bags go up to 20 slots (but on most of my characters I just use 18slot bags) and yes you can buy/sell/trade them! (So you don’t have to actually craft them yourself, unless you want to)
---
(Actually bags go up to 32 slots but that’s special circumstances to make them so ignore that for now)
---
Common bags are:
---
20slot bag is like.. 10-15gold (on trade post)
---
18slot bag is like 2-5gold 
---
So if you are short on cash (or mostly play PvP/wvw like me and won’t need “max storage bags”)... get some 18’s and save your gold for a pimped out weapons skin! (Best part of this game is the fashion wars... for real it’s good)
---
You can get bags from various places and for various prices so (I don’t want to be that guy but) wiki is your best bet.
---
Ah yes, this thread proves once again that hate on LW maps is one big meme.  
---
4 weapon sets + other solo skins  
---
2 armor sets  
---
world bosses(one with expensive infusion like in TD)    
---
lots of quite rewarding(gold wise) meta events  
---
map currency that is worth more then any HoT currency  
---
the only thing LW maps dont have is a legendary material like amalgamated gemstone  
---
  
---
But LW maps are shit, there is nothing to do on them, and they only have 1h of playtime while Hot maps are top tier right? why? oh.. because other people on reddit said so..
---
&gt; please tell me the bags get bigger than four slots!
---
You can go to 20 slots per bag for relatively cheap, and then it becomes exponentially expensive. You can also buy bag slots on the gemstore (of course).
---
I’d say give it a shot 
---
If you like it pay for the xpax then enjoy HOURS of gaming 
---
Give pvp a shot 
---
World versus world is just 3 servers battle it out and see who comes out a winner after a set time frame basically 
---
It’s constant battles and constant capping of points 
---
Gets really fun 
---
Especially if you have solo roamer builds for your character
---
Oh god no I’m poor this month, I don’t like boosting anyway, even in WoW I think I had one boosted toon out of 10 at max. :)
---
This weapon gives 210 precision.
---
What?
---
This weapon gives 10% crit chance.
---
Ooooh..
---
___
---
This weapon gives 210 concentration
---
So it's 10% boon duration?
---
Lol no it's 14%
---
...ok.
---
Why can't we just get flat % numbers?
---
Guides like this should be part of the game.
---
Thanks guys, i'll try tp stuff while maintaining what I do daily ^^
---
I think I’m on US? I’m in NZ and don’t actually remember the name of the server I’m on (I know it has sorrow in the name?)
---
invulnerability from clouds is pretty solid strategy for the ice room. That one alone took me a lot of tries to get through.
---
What? You are tired of people taking 4 minutes to change from Holo to Mirage at Largos, just to deal less than half the damage than your scourge? 
---
You get annoyed by people asking why there is no druid in your quick brand renegade subgroup?
---
You lift your eyebrows everytime someone leaves when you tell them to just dodge the boon rip?
---
How dare you!
---
The only thing I want from fill ins nowerdays is to not waste my time asking why there is two chronos in one, and no chronos in the other subgroup. It's like they saw a unicorn for the first time, but it's just a dps chrono.
---
Even got a fair share of Screenshots of people getting totally mental in chat after taking a look at the squad composition.
---
I agree with you!  In fact I decided to draw she with the staff because it was too cool ;)
---
On a side not if anyone can find this thread? I’ve scrolled endlessly through top of all time haha
---
You can sort them by tp price. And with api key you can set to show only the dyes you don't have unlocked.
---
I still think that the amount of people not watching time, but noticing the 10 minutes warning, will be enough to fill multiple maps.
---
Alright, thank you for the clarification, I'm probably not gonna rush through Season 3, but I might grab Signet of Agony because it looks *incredibly* useful
---
I hope you're right, more people in maps is always better.
---
tbh, and this gonna be unpopular opinion, you do not need mount nor gliding for story, until the moment you get them in story 
---
you might benefit from those in events and whatever trains, but then again it is much better to have maxed out stuff for that.
---
qol for story completion imo is when you have maxed out gear (lets say exotic with ascended trinkets, fitting your dps build) to not waste time on story trash mobs, or even bosses; and big bags.
---
Almost XD This pose and expression came to my mind when, in the chat of the game, some players wrote that their and mine Asuras were "soooo cute &lt;3 "
---
So in the drawing she would like to say  "I'm not cutie &gt; \_&gt;"
---
aside from unfinished domain of kourna meta, every other maps have good metas my dude.  
---
Inquest meta on second map, scaled enough for chempions to spawn is a nice gold/materials farm   
---
4th map have world boss , with a nice preevent with lots of chemp bags  
---
5th map have 2 good metas if you look how violate magic can be turned into gold, and also give you 2 items you can sell for few gold every day similar to amalgamated gemstone.  
---
and I agree with your idea, story instances are technicaly dungeons but with no replayability. This is where they can improve.  
---
Turn story instances like the one with Joko fight at the end, into a dungeons, with solo easy mode for story guys, normal mode, and few explorable path with some random Joko minions/chempions as bosses. Add some tokens, new skins (for tokens or as a lucky drop) and we are set for nice replayability.
---
Is staff weaver useless in the current Meta for any content?
---
Wave check 💯
---
Stick to FB Renegade combo.
---
Insanely good!
---
Oh yes it is.
---
Same story here, as long as you're comfortable enough with the fight to not bother the squad, just fake it or you will never start raiding.
---
cheapthril? just go for the gold.
---
grasura
---
So I'm downloading Guild wars 2. Thanks for the advice. I will be joining the noobs in the (Insert game world name here seeing as I did 0 to little research)
---
I think someone is putting a scarf on a happy recipient of said scarf gift
---
This, and some bank slots
---
dont think mystlock lobby pass is a must have, you can always use wvw Obsidian Sanctum for most of the stuff which stuff is even closer together.
---
And once you got have perma contracts it is even less worthwhile to have.
---
People rely way too much on Chronos. 😕
---
So is much help appreciated or help is much appreciated? Because if my help is only appreciated and not much appreciated I am not going to provide any help.
---
This just in: gaile died lol
---
Shared inventory slots, copper salvage, Silver salvage, and infinite mining tools!
---
Bag Slot Expansion,if you have one main char.
---
Thanks
---
In book form, takes place after X-2. Its... cringy
---
Cool, Thank you!
---
It's funny that he is a White Mage when in FFXIV WHM is the one healer people generally don't want

I have no idea if you are being entirely honest or not, but I will say that unfortunately a lot of people in at least the Reddit GW2 community are very quick to side with/defend/assume that the company is right. The logical corollary here is of course that they have to assume that people making reports like yours are lying or to find something to criticize about them. Even when someone makes a post with strong evidence supporting their case, a lot of people will come down on them in order to defend the company.
---
It really is by far the worst and most frustrating part of the community. I understand why it might be very difficult to take. On the other hand, if that really is the worst thing about the community, that's not too bad. There's a lot worse a community like this might do, and this one is on the whole pretty good. If you can look past the people who blindly jump to the defense of the company in these kinds of situations, this is definitely one of the better communities out there by far. 
---
The thing to remember is that this particular phenomenon is really for the most part only about this Reddit community, not necessarily the general playerbase which is much larger and has a much more diverse viewpoint than what you tend to see here on Reddit, and it's even really only a part of the Reddit community, too. There are those of us who are able to look at things more objectively.
---
Log horizon is such a good anime!!

Gw2 is a great game! It is not, however, much liks the mmo in log horizon, in quite a few important ways! (for one, we have not (yet) all been actually transported inside of it! Probably for the best, really!)

Or reddit. Or YouTube. Or any.
---
During layoffs there was surge of people who were "In guild with dev" and had all sorts of info. Just out of blue.
---
Or people who "remember promises of X and Y" with no backing of such things (burden of proof for claimer etc). Suddenly stuffs and memos people have kept years about "lies" and info on the "mis-management" rose.
---
It was ridiculous.
---
Yeah I was planning to do the FB Renegade combo, just my Firebrand friend is very lazy to keep boons up. As for more dps with warrior or soulbeast, I am afraid none of my friends are willing to swap classes
---
I dunno, i still have not finnished the weapon collection and a have a few achviements left, mind though i played a lot of SAB so i guess i do this after SAB is gone.
---
continue trolling
---
An old friend who doesnt rly get on much anymore ran a minstrel death blood reaper and solos all openworld content granted its slow,but it works lol. Personally i run zerker or a Marauder (with a few random trinkets) reaper when i play it. Its one of the wvw reaper builds on youtube (adjust for solo vs group play because friend is a goddess on chrono and i can go more agressive 😀)
---
Yeah that's the case
---
its actualy retarded asf,why its  6 stack,when you can lose them in 1 sec.
---
Saying JP Got fired for a heated Exchange isn’t untrue, but a bit generous to her behavior. IT’s not an Exchange when it’s just one person going off on another. EuroGamer plz!!!
---
Lol I thought he was given birth by the machine xD
---
alright, so:
---
exceptional limitations: being new
---
insane demands: wanting to play the gamemode
---
gotcha.
---
also, high in supply, low in demand? is that why the wvw community always cries about how their gamemode is dying because nobody plays it? (wonder why, maybe because whenever new people join the chat fills up with "go back to pve we dont want you")
---
I'm aware I'm not gonna get into the big boy squads with how I like to play - that's fine. Squads are led by players who therefore get to choose who is in it. But that's it. If I see a group busting down a tower I will help with siege or in fights that ensue. If I want to run around with a nonoptimal class/build, I will, if that's what I enjoy. Now, I tend to play builds that are considered useful in wvw, but if I see someone running something that's not, who am I to police them if that's how they enjoy wvw?
---
A gamemode survives by getting new players, who then decide to stick around. Not every new player will. But if the WvW community keeps sneering at new players, telling them to go back to pve (god this one was BAD during the warclaw week), essentially saying they'd rather not have them, much fewer people are going to stick around.

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crusader_Aliyana
---
Closest I could think of
---
11 million registered prolly, the active players' number is  WAYYY lower than that.
---
Wow that is big  👍
---
&gt;We can agree to disagree I guess.
---
I think we can. :)
---
&gt; All of that is because of elitism. I don't have time to watch youtube videos. I want ot learn the old fashioned way.
---
You don't have time to watch a 5 minute video guide but still have hours to spend on wiping? (Times may vary depending on boss)
---
&gt; By either people willing to go trough hell with you, explaining what needs doing, or by trial and error by a completely novice group where we all have plenty of time and fun doing it. Like Tribulation SAB, for example.
---
Not many people are willing to spend their time training others after already spending time learning the fight themselves. Good on those who still do it. You can always make your own group though.
---
Same applies to the rest of your post: make your own raid and fractal groups.
---
Snow Crows and Metabattle (and I assume other build sites) show you the recommended food/utilities.
---
Power builds, at least those that can hit the crit cap, want power and ferocity to push out even more damage, which is why they use foods like the aforementioned soup, and utilities like potent superior sharpening stones.
---
Condition builds usually want expertise to hit the condi duration cap, and always want condition damage. That's why they usually like foods like Rare Veggie Pizza or Red-Lentil Saobasa, as well as utilities that increase condition damage, like magnanimous and toxic tuning crystals.
---
Boon support classes want concentration to hit the boon duration cap (or get close enough if using SoI) and power to deal more damage, so they like soul pastries and potent lucent oils.
---
Healers obviously want more healing power and effectiveness, so they like delicious rice balls and bountiful maintenance oil.
---
I have no idea what tanks use, at least not toughness tanks. Kiters seem to use incoming damage reducing foods and either damage, healing, or boon duration increasing utilities.
---
Hey, it was a kamikaze attack. Fair and square.

Oh hello there! My name is Nern. I'm considered the greatest historian of our time... I've gathered a wealth of knowledge about Olathe and what happened here. Many tales... Would you like to hear? Hmm... I wish you were more enthusiastic... Oh well, I'll tell you anyway. Let's see.... Oh right! It all started with what I like to call, THE FLASH. I was sitting with my wife, god rest her soul, sipping on sweet lemon tea. I believe it was homemade by my sweet wife, God rest her soul. Or wait... Maybe she bought it from the store in a bottle. You know, like a plastic bottle? Well hold on now, that would be ridiculous to buy a bottle of sweet lemon tea, then transfer the contents into a glass. Why not just drink it from the bottle? I guess maybe so she could put ice in the glass? But then again, making tea homemade would be just as time consuming, if not more! That sneaky bitch... Anyway, I'll save that story for later! So, I'm sitting on my porch drinking sweet lemon tea. From a glass of course, ho ho! When suddenly... A great strangeness fills my body... Something was wrong... I've lived many years, and I've never felt something like this before. Do you know what it was? Yup! It was my rocking chair! That wooden son of a gun stopped rocking! So I looked down and realized a little rock had gotten caught beneath my chair! A rock under my rocking chair! What a day! I decided it was time for bed, I had had a little bit too much excitement for one day! Hoho! I slid into my jammies, brushed my teeth, and said my prayers. As I was climbing into bed I noticed my wife, God rest her soul, brushing her hair in the bathroom. As I peered across the hall my body swelled up with emotion...  
---
"Why can't I be married to an attractive woman?" 
---
 "Is it me?"  
---
"My bank account?"  
---
I'm a tall guy, I workout forty minutes a week... Is that not enough? Now my neighbor at the time, Tom Forknight, was very short. His wife, Karen Forknight-Plateburger... Yeah, one of THOSE women. Well, she was more attractive than my wife. I'd say she was a soft six, whereas my wife was a hard four. What's the deal? I thought women liked tall men? Why was Karen with him? Anyway my horse of a wife, God rest her soul, crawled into bed next to me. She decided to leave the bedside light on so she could read her book. It was one of her romance novels again... Give me a break... As if I don't already feel inadequate enough... Not only do I have to compete with Tom, now I have to deal with these fictional hunks! Ay yai yai! At this point I had already suppressed the urges of intimacy, I rolled over and tried to sleep. Her bedside light was only of minor annoyance. I was able to drift off... Then I woke up to a big flash of light. That's about it. I can tell by the way you're walking away that you don't want to leave... If you really want to hear another story I'll tell you. Once upon a hot summer night. Sometime in July... Was it July? My local grocery store sells really good eggs in July. I don't know why. Do chickens operate better in heat? Fireworks maybe? I don't know. I don't want to get off topic. Point is, the eggs that Summer were marvelous! Anyway, my wife and I, God rest her soul, went to a BBQ that night. It was held at Dale Spooner's house. Well, his backyard... Conny Spooner doesn't want people in her home, I think she's just an uptight bitch. So at this BBQ I see none other than... That's right, Tom Forknight... Now earlier in the day wife, God rest her soul, had made potato salad for the BBQ. Personally I hate potato salad, I'm a mashed kind of fellow. Hoho! So I sat in the TV room avoiding her till the BBQ. Once we were at the party, I made sure to distance myself from my dumb potato bitch wife. God rest her soul, I just didn't want anyone to think I would associate with someone that would bring a potato salad! Anyway, Tom and his above mediocre wife were already there. And get this, they brought a fruit salad! With whipped cream! The nerve of those Forknights! Needless to say I gave my wife, God rest her soul, a couple choice words About whipped cream! Versus potato salad! God dammit! Son of a bitch! A real tongue lashing! Geez, you're kind of smothering me. I'll talk to you later.﻿

&gt;  guild with their private map
---
You're joking, but this is actually a thing.
---
Why has he got a great axe :,D not even in the game
---
That's not quite what is meant there, they're talking about the episodes next season not always having a new map for instance. Them choosing to do another season instead of an expansion after season 4 was already communicated last year (around august/september), long before the layoffs
---
More like Anet gave Chrono a great kit and forgot to share it with anyone else. Same could be said for Healdruids.
---
It's probably bannable, you can get banned for pulling creepers at teq or repeatedly killing octovines in Tarir. Submit a report and see what happens
---
Okay let's remove every content in the game that gives rewards because theoretically speaking someone is able to ruin it for others. /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
It depends on you as a player. I think shared inventory slots would be good but they are just too expensive per slot to really be good for me. I have heard good things from copper fed salvager but I can get away without one (will get later on however most likely).
---
I feel more back space is good more so if you have lots of alts. If you have a more "this is my main character" view then bag slots could be good but if you jump around a lot then I question the value and push further value into good bag organisation and bank slots to help this (also I see the value in more material storage and just haven't gotten around to it yet).
---
If you like world bossees then the world boss portal device is nice (and something I really wanted and got). It just makes life a bit easier and comes with ability to teleport to them so you can just go about your business without missing them as much (I still don't use it loads but is nice when wondering what to do and then get a boss coming up and think sure sounds fun).
---
Infinite gathering tools I feel vary on the player. I see their use but the price to benefits of a lot of things make me question them.
---
Character slots can be nice if you are an altoholic (I like having 1 of each class and each race) but thats also varies on what use you will get out of them.
---
My general advice is what do you want and how good the benefit is for the price and if that price is acceptable to you. Even cosmetics are hit and miss for some people but some people really like them so just browse through the shop, see the price (and convert the gems to gold or your currency to get an idea of investment). If you are unsure don't get it, you can always get it later, even if it is on discount it will be on discount again another time so don't rush these things. I am pretty low on money so I am much more picky on what I get but I feel it is best not to rush into purchases since that is how you make more mistakes. Generally speaking are you wanting something because it will save you money in the long run or do you want it for the benefit of less hassle to get new tools every so often etc. Generally the return on investment for a lot of things is so long you might never actually reach it (like infinite gathering tools).
---
Generally I am against the idea of consumables however in the gem shop since it is use and done which feels very expensive and loss of investment so I recommend items that are infinite use / permanent unlock.
---
It is still useful in WvW zergs afaik.
---
This should be stickied.
---
But:
---
&gt; Every class plays like a glass cannon
---
I'd rather say
---
"Every class **can** play like a glass cannon **if you have the skill and reflexes to pull it off, and don't mind regularly dying from a single hit.**"
---
Imho the reddit community's focus on glasscannon builds is really not a good advice for newbies, as they will die all the time, and just get bitter about the game. On each HoT meta run the floor is covered with players who go down from a single hit from a boss. I'd prefer they put on some tankier gear, and actually stay standing and participating. Glass cannon builds I think are for players who like high risk/reward playstyle. For people preferring a more laidback experience, with more space for mistakes or slow reactions, don't be ashamed to put on some vitality (or thoughness, though that draws aggro.)
---
Caveat: all the above refers to open-world play. From what I read on raids and high lvl fractals you need to min-max it.
---
I've been getting GW2 ads on Instagram all the time now! Yay!
---
and its not AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH its an actual ad *claps*
---
That's fair, and understandable. Endgame in GW2 is certainly doable in weaker gear, barring high level fractals that have Agony requirements.
---
Why not promote its free? (Kinda)
---
You might have success with putting up a lfg and see if people bite. Just specify if you want to run story or explorable, and which path(s). If you have no luck, wait until the specific dungeon is a daily achievement, there are tons more people doing them on those days.
---
I don't follow why that is relevant in an open world meta.
---
You already have metal bits on your longbow though.
---
If you are interesting in how they created splatoon and the stuff behind and around it (they created a whole popculture specifically for it) then I can only recommend the [GDC talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VwTVIEge1g)
---
&gt; About the one saving grace (or possibly not) is that the things you'd think of as "ranged" weapons mostly have long-range spells associated with them, and the "close-combat" ones mostly have short-range ones.
---
But there are also a lot of exceptions to that. Mesmer greatsword, rev hammer, necro and ranger axes, rev and daredevil staff.
---
In my experience it fills up quickly for AC, CoF, CoE, hotw p1 and TA up fw and SE p1, p3. People avoid Arah like the plague.
---
Wtb interview with somebody not still there and clearly heavily invested with 10 years of employment.  Unnecessary downvoting of this comment unless you're not interested in critical thinking behind why this interview exists.

Alright, people, let’s do this one last time. My name is Pexx Pakker. I was bitten by a radioactive spider. I'm from Lions Arch in the year 3145. I have a psychic link with a spider who lives inside my mentor's golem, and we're best friends forever.
---
when you need to use up this financial year's budget after firing/losing half your valuable staff :D
---
Yeah it's true, necro ranger and thief seem to be missing. Mesmer is the lady with the illusionary sword

Ohh that is mesmer. The picture is sadly very small on my phone.

And that describes how to viper scourge
---
The only scary thing to me is there isn't any talk of after L.S. S5. Sure they don't have to have a finite plan of "what's to come" and maybe they are limiting their focus on the current cycle that all makes sense too; but, IMO they should know if there will be an expac between L.S. 5 and 6. I personally don't feel that is a "spoiler" or giving away too much but the Studio not confirming the L.S ---&gt;expac ----&gt; L.S. cycle is a bit concerning to me.
---
Exceptional demands : joining literally any group with a tag up.

How good are spell breakers now? Is it too late to replay gw2.  Last time I Played was in 2015 before HoT or PoF came out.
---
Damn perspective.
---
I don't think it's something you can report. 
---
Sounds more like a wanabe open world elitist.
---
Get Schwifty!
---
oh no, the elitist raiders are invading open world too now
---
Airships, fires, raptors, lilys
---
21:9 support confirmed!
---
I’m not being elitist? I’m just pointing out how farcical OP’s post is because people aren’t playing how he wants them to play lol
---
it's not elegal to be a cunt, no
---
Shitting on coordination and asking others to adapt to YOU is not the right thing.
---
I am quite fond of carrot souffle for wvw since I mainly run power scourge,give 200 power on kills lasts an hour among other stats, really nice
---
&gt; Supply up on ectos, prices will skyrocket at event, sell midway
---
Last year average exchange rates for zephyrite supply boxes stabilized a little below 25s. Its true that ecto prices skyrocketed to that value but that was only possible becuase ectos were valued at 12-13s before the event. Now they are already valued at 20-22s, so how do you expect them to rise in value so hard to enable you to earn mad cash?
---
To set it apart from free browser games and the like. Free makes it seem low value.
---
probably doesnt have a job anyways
---
Yes, weapons scale to different sized characters. Dark Harvest is just huge.
---
Suppose, but other than the artwork there's zero selling points marketed here. Even if it was 'try it now for free' suggests there's paid elements, best of both worlds.
---
"Zafirah’s Package"
---
I'm immature, leave me alone.
---
It's not about being smart, it's about clearing efficiently. Not everyone wants to solo 10 man content for hours.
---
If you need hours to learn any bosses mechanics in this game, you probably shouldn't be playing it.
---
It takes me at most, two attempts to learn any bosses mechanics in this game. It's piss easy. I've never watched a video on any of the bosses. Hell, I did CM fractals blind and nearly got the no deaths achievement my first try.
---
This is by far, the easiest dungeon/raid game on the market by a massive amount. The insanity people have is actually counterproductive to not only others own fun and time, but their own. You waste so much time trying to get your perfect little team of 5/10 players to clear content made for toddlers.
---
I'm still really bitter about this whole thing. I think its absolute garbage that theyve spent 2 years putting this game on the backburner, creating mostly single-meta useless maps, a degrading raid wings, shoulders locked behind loot boxes, mounts behind loot boxes, and then more mounts.  
---
During all this, they didnt communicate much, which they clearly could have since theyve started to since -- however, we still dont have a lot of actual content lately to keep people busy. Restructure isnt happening yet, even though it was announced so long ago.   
---
Personally, I think the CEO should be let go for letting all the money we gave t hem over 2 years go to waste in projects while it negatively impacted the playerbase.  
---
They'll have to work really hard, and for 1-2 years straight, to get a single penny from me again.
---
It's time to make raids 5 man.

---
Draconis Mons has a good gathering spot with like 8 flax nodes, takes like 30 sec for gathering.
---
The End of Draconis Mons Jumping Puzzle isn't that bad also.
---
yeah totally agree
---
And 90% is more than enough to control the flow of the meta.
---
But that doesn't change that 'private maps' are not a thing, even if guilds can do something kind of similar by using map volunteering and join in map tricks.  
---
Remember that there's people other than experienced players reading these things. Go around telling people something that isn't technically the truth as if it was truth without any clarification, half-lies and half-truths build up over time, and things snowball into random nonsense.
---
I find it uterly funny that NCsoft is probably behind all this yet they don't appear at all on the ads lmao
---
probably because aurene wasn't close to having that level of magic inside her.
---
there is always a jump
---
&gt; It is NEVER a 5 minute video.
---
&gt;Mostly a group of people, chatting online using TV or Discord, speaking words you sometimes can't understand. Or using terms many are not familiar with to begin with.
---
Other people could probably tell you better where to find the video guides but I know [Tekkit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiSsq85T23Q) [has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6SnUnsppPc) [a](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFo5QPoZ1aM) [bunch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWO-9zdVJlc) [of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEMMRwoM56Q) [good](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjzG0qEi20o) [ones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=04KJ9Mtocmw). Some are even less than 5 minutes.
---
&gt; It is too damn convoluted to start raiding, just like that. Especially if you are solo, without any contacts or a group of people that you play with much of the time with. Assuming they are interested in doing what you want to do. Raid.
---
&gt;LFG is useless for those that want to raid, but are too put off by the complex mechanics, catered to perfect timing and unforgiving if you are not specifically specced and geared.
---
"VG training, everyone welcome | 2 chrono, 1 heal scourge, 1 druid, 1 warrior, 2 cdps &amp; 3 pdps". There you go, change accordingly depending on what you play. Wasn't really convoluted and I'm pretty sure you'll get a group going. Can't guarantee everyone will stay for a long time or that you'll get the kill even if you spend 10 hours on it though.
---
Well she currently is

mad cash as in ingame gold you imbecile
---
That’s me on W1Z1 when it’s the pounding rocks before the angry cloud. “Yes, I made it to the next platf... and how the hell did that still hit me??” -&gt; ALT + F4.
---
I hand it to those that completed and enjoyed SAB. Realized it was not for me and decided the time investment would just frustrate me when I have other things to focus on as a returning player.
---
They are definitly having plans. The story of hot was in development even before living story season one started. There are even hints in the personal story of 2012 what is expected to be next. And these hints are not redcons baked in with the release of hot. It took two seasons over a much longer period of time like nowadays until the Xpack hit the shelves. Just because they don't tell us there long term plans you can be absolutely sure that the road after season five is already layed out. Game development happens not in six to twelve months. Given that season 5 will be prbly six episodes again we are talking 2020 till it is finished. There is no need to announce anything more than 18 months in advance. No hype will live up to such a long period of time and it will also do no good for the product, nor their customers.
---
Wow.. ive been playing since beta off and on and here I am proud to have just broken 500g. Maybe one day I'll have Eternity. You have talent my friend.
---
It currently costs slightly more than the buy list pricing to craft it.  Be that as it may the recipe itself is rare and costs hundreds of gold on the TP.
---
I don't think they've ever revealed that far into the future. It's always "what's next". What happens after Season 5 could still be up in the air though as it's over a year away at least. They could easily be developing story/maps/elite specializations now that could be implemented into either expansion or living world season 6.
---
I attempted W1Z1 Trib several times with Taco. I’m terrible at jumping. Never completed.
---
Grats on those skins! I couldn’t have done it.
---
I think it actually has something to do with the amount of magic they already developed or consumed. Aurene didn't consume that much magic, therefore there wasn't really that much which could've been released. If anything we just saw how Aurene actually absorbed a fraction of Balthazars and Mordremoths magic. The distinction here would be **a fraction**. Compared to how much Balthazar and Mordremoth were able to absorb, Aurenes "level" of magic pales against these two entities. 
---
"But what about Palawa Joko?!" Please correct me if I'm wrong on this one, but if I remember correctly Vlast, who was killed by Balthazar, literally exploded. No body left. I have a feeling that seeing Aurene impaled and all is part of Jokos magic, which Kralkatorrik might not have bothered consuming because... well, Aurene has so little magic it's not even worth to be considered a little treat.
---
WoW doesn't even have 11 million players and is much bigger than this game, lol.
---
Honestly, I don't know how I managed to draw all these years without CSP. You really nailed it.
---
oh man I love your stuff a lot, really adore the amount of detail in your pieces - followed you on both places!
---
11 million Npcs’s
---
Ah yes, that makes more sense.
---
Did you play HoT yet?
---
You learn to survive. Lots of dodging. In my case, I do high burst, so they die before I do. The expansions are certainly both much harder than the base game.
---
10% jump is still a 5% loss
---
Man, if you want to talk about survival, pick an elem and try to clear all PoF areas alone. Good luck :)
---
yeah thats what goldsellers say
---
this. All of the servers with a bigger OCX presence are currently locked. Getting into a linked server is a way to join, but i would recommend waiting until the end of april since there will be a re-link.
---
plenty of mats didnt spike last year because their vendor conversion rate was above the 25s value.
---
I don't think Aurene has the "lifeforce of this world" level of magic inside her
---
&gt; current cheapest hard wood log
---
I suppose you mean it's the cheapest considering how much you need to give for a supply box? Because I think t5 and t6 cloth scraps are extremly cheap,  but you need way more to actually get a box.
---
&gt; people think they're so smart when they put insane requirements but all they do is drift players away from this content 
---
I don't really get the premise that people who argue like you have. Why would anyone care about drifting players away from raid content? If you get discouraged by not being able to leech content with experienced people and instead have to actually learn that stuff yourself, why would anyone want you in that content? 
---
You already see the results in current raid lfg. Have something go wrong in a try and you're getting the two types of players handed on a silver plate. The one able to adapt and still clear successful, the other ones ending up dead or wiping after a short delay because they have no clue how to recover. The first type are the people who actually learned the encounter with people not being able to carry them. They know what to do, how to react and how to salvage unlucky RNG / a bad decision  that was made before. The second type are the ones who leeched the bosses with groups that don't really need to care about one DPS player doing their stuff right. Most people who have that many LI weren't handed these by leeching from experienced players. They slowly became experienced players. By wiping, repeating, erasing mistakes over weeks or years. Not by getting boss KP after dying to e.g. desmina wall at 80% and the other 9 being good enough to still finish the encounter. 
---
To sum it up, yeah people are actually that smart if these requirements drive away players from the content, because the players driven away by needing experience for experienced groups are not the type of players that are wanted by these groups anyways.
---
One can hope it jumps more. Its the riskier move. Atm I only stacked up with hard wood to bust open hundreds of supply boxes and take my chances.
---
I play tempest heal, joke on you
---
Only ignorants (or idiots) could really think that Anet never cared...it's still a business after all. They just take on another attempt of growing their game.
---
I wanted elves and horses, anet did not deliver xD
---
then I asked kodan/tengu -- likewise
---
Your sarcasm detector is broken.
---
Have you not seen all the new youtube ad's?
---
Fries would probably give the most unbiased comment. But then again a lot of the old vets who already quit the company said good things about them, specially josh who was even emotional.
---
someone's trying to raise the market on his overstocked ectos
---
One more question. Is there a character that can do offensive magic and heal/give buffs to allies? That's the kind of player I am
---
Yeah, I recall in 2014 they mentioned there were more than 100 million accounts created. No idea how many there are now, but it's probably an absurd number now.
---
I barely touched weaver for some reason, I just love being the weird guy in the back playing the old spec, with a weird role (well now it's a good support, what a time to be alive).
---
Weaver seemed so squeeshie in open world, yet so tanky in sPvP
---
I just always hide the shoulders on my heavy classes. ez fix.
---
Fair enough. Don't follow that side of things so my first impression when a company does a press release it's always going to have pr connotations to it.  Downvoted for not blindly reading articles and actually thinking first about them 🤣
---
If you want to join SAND talk to u/Zekiirah and she can help!
---
That is correct but not what you said before.
---
Taking your example with your previous statement: 
---
&gt; Make sure the diff between prices is greater than 85% of the sell price and you'll make gold. 
---
Difference = 1g - 85 s = 15 s and that is definitely not greater than 85% of 1g.
---
The difference has to be greater than *15%* of the sell price. Or buy price has to be max 85% of sell price, which is the same thing.
---
They’re saying that it seems dishonest to advertise total accounts like that because to many people it’s clearly going to read as “11 million active players” which they almost definitely don’t have.
---
&gt; this scene?
---
lmao
---
I follow half of it and might follow the other half if I have the expenses. Notice the "Atm" prefix.
---
Go be rude elsewhere, rat.
---
2 mobs, lol. Reminds me of when I first stepped into verdant brink and 5 little pocket sized **DEMONS** summoned straight from the pits of hell tore into me like a rhino running through cheap wet tissue paper. Barely survived. Now I always hunt down the little bastards when I have time. I hate them so much.
---
its not hard on any class while being a zerker glasscannon.  
---
there is something called cc, for crowd control, and especially the soft version in form of blind is not so soft for enemies.  
---
how one can have any problems on elementalist, one of the burstiest classes in the game and one of the stronges blind fields with glyph of storms on earth is beyond me.
---
Welcome to the desert.
---
Sure thing
---
[https://imgur.com/emcNosr](https://imgur.com/emcNosr)
---
Or maybe I could just advertise it on the forum, lions arch map chat and divinity's reach map chat.
---
I kind of agree with your post since it's the same for me but I know that's hardly the case for most players in GW2 though.
---
The reason I have a static raid and fractal group and carefully pick replacements if we're missing someone is exactly because a lot of people can't actually handle the mechanics created for "toddlers". That means on some bosses wiping is still possible even if 9/10 already play well if the last one causes a wipe (blacks on Deimos, bomb on Dhuum, dying early on Twins, poison field on Sloth etc.). It gets considerably worse if you try to assign any extra mechanics on them (green on Dhuum, pushing on SH, kiting on Qadim, reflect on Matthias etc.).
---
I don't require any LI though when looking for replacements and instead look for someone who is experienced and can join TS3. That's usually enough to get someone decent. I also don't assign any extra mechanics on any them, at all, just dps (unless I have a feeling they can handle them). So I wouldn't say I'm wasting time trying to get a perfect team.
---
Are you sure? Click on the achievement and see if you've completed it like [this](https://i.imgur.com/UaRFaQO.png). Note that since this is a infinitely repeatable achievement with 1 objective, it will look 'uncompleted' even though you have completed it.
---
Hey Wolftrack, thanks a lot for your feedback. That's just what I assumed is gonna be. I remember since pre-release PvP was such of a significant factor, due to great combat system in my opinion, I'm really sad conquest has not been expanded practically since then... Anyway I may come back to buy and finish yet another big expansion when it releases, but I'm not feeling like bothering with living world seasons... Keeping my fingers crossed for thing to turn different, greetings!
---
Trying out power staff daredevil and have a few questions. SnowCrow, Discretize and 
---
MetaBattle shows that I should use staff 2 but everyone’s been telling me to use staff 5 since it deals more damage, this is mostly during fractals. So should I be using staff 5 instead of staff 2? 
---
Also how do I keep endurance up for bounding dodger and initiative points for staff 2 and 5, can’t really find the connection or combo for the daredevil rotation. I mostly do fractals if it matters, so would staff 2 or staff 5 be better for fractal encounters.
---
According to a dev post here recently, this advertising campaign was in the works for roughly a year. Unrelated to the layoffs (so likely NCsoft as well).
---
https://youtu.be/jpTeZKpwQxM
---
Spiiler warning for some minor side stories. But he explains an idea of cpre guardian support for open world only though.
---
Well Raids as far as I know raids  requires  you to have the corresponding expansion, so even if you find a build you can´t go into a raid.
---
This is why I only did W2 trib one time just for the AP. W1 wasn't bad and I enjoyed that for the most part. W2 though even normal mode just is too long.
---
But... the are non-expansions raids too, right ? Or Raids are expansion thing only ?
---
Not at all ? How does it work now ? Truth is I came back after about 3 years (or 2?) and this mix of expansion non-expansion seems very tricky to me.
---
As far I know raids are expansion only sry.
---
Sadness. *adds demerit* .... *bans account for correcting me*
---
&lt;3
---
You need Heart of Thorns for HoT raids or Path of Fire for PoF raids. You can play fractals f2p tho.
---
No raid at all. Wing 1-4 are HoT and 5+6 are PoF. You also need some masteries for later bosses in the raids (i.e. leyline gliding for wing 3 Final boss)
---
There are ads in Lion’s Arch?
---
You can do dungeons ans fractals though. A core guardian build should work there as dps or heal. But its not optimal
---
I am curious how Path of Fire would've looked as a living world release. I think the Crystal Oasis and chapter 1 of the story (maybe some restructure of the story) would've worked well as an episode release. I honestly felt like Path of Fire maps were fun and I felt too rushed to stop and enjoy the maps one at a time.
---
Wait if GW2 is 11 Million strong right now...
---
Does that mean we are bigger than WoW now and thereforr the biggest MMO on the market?! :O
---
nobody says ANet didnt care about gw2 at all. it just seemed like they didnt care about it as much as they should have.
---
Ok, maybe I mixed raids and dungeons... my bad. Do you have any guide for dungeons/fractals for core guardian ?
---
Wings 1234 require heart of thorns, wings 5 and 6 are path of fire raids. There are no core raids
---
ITs not optimal but sure you could have it. Core guardian cleric , magis , harrier or minstrel I belive. Staff , mace and shield. Thats what Im runing, no clue if you will be able to use it in raids. Shouts might be nice as skills. And a really good groop wich would take you in. That would be probably the worst part xD
---
Nope.
---
My dream going to Cantha one day, and getting a complete set of 'unarmed' specializations, one for each profession. 
---
In the story, it could be explained by telling players that the Ministry of Purity has a strict weapon control, so the locals would teach the commander how to fight unarmed after they are captured and their weapons have been confiscated.
---
Just imagine it. 
---
* There could be a mastery that replaces the empty unarmed weapon slots with unarmed skills. 
---
 * These skills would be there even when not specialized as martial artist, but with less power than when specialized, allowing using these unarmed skills for roleplaying and experimenting, just for fun. 
---
 * Professions with weapon swap would get 2 different sets of unarmed skills, switching between two fighting styles that fit the profession.  
---
* There would also be a new weapon type like "Fist weapon" that can be equipped by the martial artist specializations. Something like gloves, gauntlets, katar, tekko, brass knuclets, bracelets, bangles, iron wrist rings, boxing gloves, kick-boxing gloves, etc. 
---
 * The martial artist specializations would increase the power of unarmed skills, and the fist weapon would give them weapon strength to be in part with other skills instead being just for fun. 
---
Then each profession would have their own unique styles:
---
* Brute - warrior. Sumo and wrestling moves. Lots of grapples, pushes and launches.
---
* Monk - guardian: Southern shaolin and aikido styles. Really good at bursts and counters.
---
* Brawler - revenant. The revenant gains two legends instead one: [Kilroy Stonekin](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kilroy_Stonekin) and [Courier Falken](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Courier_Falken). Stonekin would focus on standing one's ground and punching, and Falken on movement and kicks.
---
* Vigilante - engineer using 'gadget-aided' unarmed combat like grappling hooks and extending arms, much like batman in modern movies and the Arkham series.
---
* Menagerist or Warden - ranger using something like the animal-inspired in one of the 5-animal chinese martial arts: Tiger, Crane, Deer, Bear and Monkey. The pet also gets skills that combine with the ranger attacks, based on the pet archetype.  
---
* Assassin - thief: Uses mostly styles used by ninja and covert-ops to take enemies from the shadows.
---
* The Master of Elements : An elementalist that goes full Avatar on us.
---
 * Fire using Northern Shaolin styles with lots of acrobatics and rapid hits in succession. 
---
 * Water based on Tai Chi with flowing movies.
---
 * Air based on Ba Gua with evasive dance-like moves.
---
 * Earth based on Hung Ga, throwing rock slabs at the enemy and creating walls of stone.
---
* Dancer - mesmer: using flowing and deceptive dancelike moves to fight, like [Maki and Chizuru](https://youtu.be/nx6PEdc4GCo) Kagura from King of Fighters.
---
* Wraith - necromancer:  using a combination of Gen's mantis style from Street Fighter, and Duolon's snake-like style from King of Fighters along inspiration of 'touch' skills from GW1. The mantis attacks would be faster, interrupt and steal life, while the snake-like attacks would hit harder, but have a bit more buildup, with more evades and teleports in the shadows and pierce armor.
---
Considering all of HoT maps are populated, and most of the season 3 maps are too, I suppose they did a pretty good job at giving incentives to go back there.
---
I love it!
---
Can’t you upgrade the PvP/WvW armor sets to legendary if you bust your ass enough?
---
By the way, what is that 11 million players statistic? Is it the number of active players? Or the number of accounts ever created? Like, WoW has 100+ millions of players over its life, but only 5-10m active ones right now.
---
&gt; It's always an explosion or a giant monster with asura failures. There is no in between.
---
There's also "Hung from ears off signpost"; less fatal, anyway.
---
Maybe he did and you just didn’t see it because you were at the bottom of a crater, fading in and out of consciousness?
---
We have an unspoken rule in the community: we don't talk about the JP incident anymore.
---
We didn't really see what happened. Everything went bright and the commander lost consciousness. 
---
Aurene didn't have as much magic as a god or a dragon, but we can't say what happened to that magic at this point. 
---
Was it consumed by Kralkatorrik? Was it spent by Aurene defending the commander? Was it used in the process of ascending Aurene into Godhood and replacing Balthazar?
---
We just don't know.
---
Ahhh okay. So once you get the Mini Gordon, you get the Annual Nostalgia?
---
The problem is if they make GW2 their only thing then ArenaNet dies when GW2 dies.
---
Also... "poorly made?" Come on.
---
Fuck off already. Nobody forces you to follow it.
---
If that was a thing you would turn into the Sun basically
---
If you struggle with two enemies it's you, not the equipment.
---
Hilariously enough I barely spend at it since I had a huge gap between this and Warbringer. Somehow my mystic coins and clovers stocked up so much, that I only ended up spending on crafting Amalgamated Gemstones and the few remaining T6.
---
Yeah I have no idea. Doesn't matter from a marketing perspective I guess.
---
That's not how it works though. Nice try.
---
When it was announced people were pretty much shitting on it.
---
Typical College of Dynamics.
---
To be fair most of them were gen 1 leggos.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, I'll try that next time I see one for a daily. :)
---
Spell breaker is also one of the better duelist in sPvP
---
&gt; Also... "poorly made?" Come on.
---
It's definitely subjective but I agree with OP that its poorly made
---
individual flax farms are limited to one full harvest per day per account, so positioning more than one alt there is pointless. just some additional info for you.
---
For once I'd like to see a montage of clips where the player in question just strings together a bunch of their own fails in game.
---
Like please can we try that format? Being humble and silly?
---
"I'm going to post my thoughts on a public message board!"
---
*Oh no! People pointed out my mistakes and aren't leaving to conversation when I tell them to!*
---
Ofcourse but the requirements for most organised open world maps are much lower.
---
It is never too late to change a community. The problem is that nobody seems to be willing to start. Everyone is free to start a squad and request whatever they want to. Is the excessive kp demand stupid? Yes it is but how would Anet be able to help here? All we need is more commanders lowering the kp requirements to compete with the high kp groups.
---
5 is more damage, but 2 is more dps because cast time and initiative cost are much lower so you can cast it more often. Those websites are pretty minmaxed so there's no point in listening to anyone else.
---
We are talking about tarir. There is no requirement other than to read the one sentence on the top right on how the event works.
---
There was one particular person who posted a few of such videos. Forgot the name unfortunately.
---
I came to say, member when WoW was this big?
---
I beg to differ, Soulbeast with Dagger/Dagger is also a pretty good choice for this thematic. Go something like Rock Gazelle for merge for a roundhouse kick, a dash, and a slightly-more-fantasy ground pound. Much less the "flashy" Kung-Fu movie style, way more grounded and realistic style.
---
Daredevil = kung-fu or ninja sort of movie martial artist
---
Soulbeast = more grounded, realistic martial artist
---
Yeah but this is the internet!? RESPECT MY INVALID OPINION
---
Perhaps "No Subscription" would a good tag to throw on there?
---
5. PvP is also a great way of making gold if you like that
---
&gt;I'd guess the money comes mainly from NCsoft anyway?
---
Isn't the money for anything game related normally self generated?
---
Why would they run a game that makes them have to spend, it should be at the very least self sustainable.
---
Only in T3/T4 fractals and raids will people want you to have a proper meta build and in some cases it will be required. For all the rest of PvE you can pretty much do whatever you want. 
---
I main a condi-Mirage (Mesmer PoF elite spec) and I use Axe/Pistol+Greatsword, full viper armor and firework runes for the 25% movement buff which is a huge help in open world. Greatsword is a power weapon but required if you want to actually tag anything as a mesmer and firework runes give 0 condi buffs but do buff power and have a nice in combat buff and in open world are just fine. If I ever decide to do raids, I'd switch to a proper raid build and when I do fractals I switch to a full condi meta build and replace my greatsword with torch. 
---
For Ranger, greatsword+longbow are actually meta again, with Power Soulbeast. Now in Fractals/raids you would be better with all melee weapons but you can keep longbow in your inventory to switch for open world when you need a ranged option. On the condi side, shortbow is the go to.
---
Yes if you own the expansions you can go into PvP and you have access to everything and you can use level 1 weapons and do max damage in the testing area. The only thing you don't have is full access to runes and sigils since there are PvP options and they don't have everything that is in PvE but there is always something close if it's not available. This is actually what I have done for years since HoT came out to test new elite specs before going all in.
---
Ranger: Good for traversing open world both solo and in a group, great sustain if built right (plus your pet tends to tank damage for you if you bring along a melee one), longbow is one of the easiest to use and highest range weapons in the game on them, and both Druid and Soulbeast have several viable builds both in high-tier Fractals and Raids.
---
You read whatever you want to read.
---
They aren't dishonest, they are intentionally loose and that's how marketing works.
---
Hoping they do, otherwise they are going to be sad to find out no raids for them lol
---
&gt; Exploration: Oh, you found a shortcut to get from A to B quicker? Cool. But why did you want to go B? Oh, you were just exploring? Well that’s cool I guess, it certainly must have felt amazing to discover that for the first time but ... what now?
---
Plot twist: That "shortcut" is also full of chak ...
---
Many power DPS classes like dragonhunter, daredevil, and holosmith can go from their glass cannon raid builds to a more self-sufficient open world build with only a few trait or weapon changes. 
---
You're free to fight at range outside of raids and fractals, but when you're doing organized group content you need to stack in melee range regardless of your build. This is how most buffs and healing are distributed so it's important to be close to your team.
---
Is it time to jump back in? Haven't played since it turned F2P
---
You can but iirc it's not the same as the flashy legendary gear from raids. Still, an option.
---
What does AP stand for? I've seen this used but not sure what it is
---
Last time the event financed me getting a full 32-slot bag upgrade. I hope this time it's going to finance a shiny new legendary. If only I knew what Mesmers get next.
---
Ok, that would help a lot, gotta unlock the Jackal, then...
---
I realize this might shock you, but on /r/guildwars2, you're going to run into a lot of people who like Guild Wars 2.
---
Like /u/Rainbow_Stares said, DPS is your best bet, but you can get away with healing some as most classes. You won't be the best, and going as some hybrid healing/dps would be better than just healing, but you can make something work. 
---
Fractals up til tier 4 aren't hard enough that you're going to need to run meta anything, and open world you can get away with whatever. Toy with stuff. Here's something I threw together in 5 minutes just barely glancing at traits and skills and stuff. I don't play guardian ever, so I don't know the class, but this is part of something that might work ok that you could tweak and is definitely not optimal or anything. Lots of aegis blocking, heals when you do aegis, and some general recovery for allies. 
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNAW8el8AhShY7QwTIQTEHUEVu8SvHAXADQFcr1mMAA-jpQXABlXGAg9HAA
---
Gotta say. This is quite a unique take on a necro, if i've ever heard any.  
---
"Iron Legion. Sending fourth their meatshields of undead to hold the enemy in place while the cannons blow everything in that general direction to dust, be they minion or enemy"  
---
It's awesome :P
---
If you have difficulty evading boss attacks and are going for range, I'd recommend not going Chrono honestly. Chrono is just in high demand in Raids and T4 Fractals, which probably in part led to this recommendation.
---
Well I've heard a lot of stories about necros getting kicked from fractal groups. Dunno how accurate they are (and don't really care because I don't play fractals), but it's always a good thing to joke about.
---
Scourge is great for anything, I bring it to raids, pvp, wvw, story, open world and sometimes dungeons when I'm too lazy to relog. Heal build is great for carrying bad raid pugs or pulling them to death with transfusion when they annoy you
---
with the current storyline... I don't want to get transported... But then I can finally smack Braham on the face... *thinking seriously*
---
Quite the freak u've envisioned, i gotta say.  
---
Though every1 in the game seems pretty friendly towards the PC, but that ofc doesn't have to relate much to the backstory
---
Is it possibly due to lack of mobility? I mean, I don't see that as a reason personally since speedclears aren't what I'm after, but I can't figure out why they'd be kicked?
---
My suggestion would be power reaper. Can do nice damage and has a lot of survivability.
---
If you're having trouble finding world bosses/events, use https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers
---
You can copy the bracket codes and paste in game to show it on the map.
---
Aside from "decent" dps and their own personal sustain, they bring very little/nothing to the group. There is always something better to bring than a necro if you're running a comp/half comp.
---
While I'd never personally turn one down, I can see why others would (though they shouldn't).
---
Just noticed game journos are full of shit?
---
Ranger or Warrior.
---
I've not even got Thorns yet.  I'm just starting to head back. I logged in and couldn't remember what anything was or the key layout and got disappointed and logged out lol. Try again later.
---
Chasura
---
Empyreal fragments for the Heroic Dragonsblood weapons.
---
Staff 2 is a little more cost efficient. But staff 5 has the evade
---
You can do well in WvW zergs. There’s a good build for it on metabattle, it has a lot to the optimal damage rotation but I find that complexity rewarding when you pull off good plays.
---
I cant recommand mesmer for open world. All the viable endgame chrono builds are just meh in open world. The have rly high cooldowns. Are 100 support or are mostly single target dps. So all in all nothing you wanna use in open world. 
---
And on top of that Mesmer is one of the hardest classes to learn and not rly suited for a beginner in my opinion.
---
DPS didn't change in south during that time, the burn window increased. So the south players don't justify it at all with their "skill", they got it handed.
---
I think OP was talking about the name of the actual world, which in the case of GW2 would be "Tyria". I could be wrong though
---
She's... pretty dead. Very dead, you could even say. You might even say she's Aurene-kebab.
---
It's absolutely smart business to explore other revenue streams. My problem with what they were doing is they didn't balance that exploration with maintaining GW2 as well as they should have.
---
With multiple team reshuffles, content delays and lower content quality like we saw in places like Domain of Kourna, the effect of what they were doing on the sides was noticeably negatively impacting the game.
---
Recently they turned staff into a better healing weapon, couple that with a mace/shield which heals when you auto and you're pretty great when it comes to healing.
---
Currently a LOT of a guardian's support comes from firebrand and its books, so if you do ever get POE go for that..
---
Otherwise, I'd find a armor set that has high vit/healing power for Force of will (honor) that gives you extra healing based on your vitality.
---
My favorite build is with a trait, Pure of heart (honor) that says that aegis heals when it ends, meaning, if you build to spam as much aegis as possible, every time your teamates get hit, they heal instead of taking damage.
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Everytime i come back to the game I almost play the core GW 2 maps. since I played through the game one time incl. 100 % map comp with one char (incl. LS Maps). HoT and PoF are nice but for some reason I am not getting hooked. especially PoF is something I do only if there is a dayli and if I need Hero Points for new LVL 80 char.
---
&gt;To put it all dramatic like. Anet owns our accounts not us. We play at their discretion. We are account holders and basically renting access to gw2 from them. They can cut off our access for most any reason they want.
---
With all due respect, that's not how it works. I'm pretty much sure EULA is public offer kind of contract, so they can't go back on their words and "cut off our access for most any reason they want." You could actually sue them for such thing.
---
I'm very slowly working my way through the HoT story at the moment, and let me tell you I *vastly* prefer the PoF maps. Seriously, the jungle is far too complicated to navigate without a map, and the map we have does not do an adequate job of representing such a heavily three-dimensional area - *especially* areas like Verdant Brink.
---
Vampirism was the best for that
---
Expecting people to change the way they normally behave on the internet...you're pretty naive, aren't you?
---
People who want to help will do so on their own accord, without needing to be told to do so.
---
Telling people to change the way they behave, temporarily while at it, because of a recent event is nothing but laughable, considering they will go back to being themselves very shortly...because it takes a lot of effort to pretend to be someone you are not.
---
First tab:
---
* Machete
---
Other tabs, in this order of priority:
---
* Box of WvW Supplies
---
* Trophy Bag (rare)
---
* Heavy Karmic Crafting Bag.
---
* Sigil Bag (rare).
---
* Rune Bag (rare).
---
* Bag of Educational Supplies
---
* Bag of rare gear.
---
* Bag of Jewels
---
* Large bags of obsidian : This now has the lowest priority because I have way over 2000 now.
---
And since I always have a surplus of Aurilium but less Ley-line crystals, if there's nothing interesting in the Aurilium tab, I get a Bag of Ley-Line Crystals.
---
i'd say it's crystal clear she's dead
---
I'll give you three guesses as to how I primarily navigate. You'll only need one.
---
Sometimes this game is morbidly horrifying when you think about it.
---
Thank for your comment, I mostly agree with that.
---
Obviously, people will not change their behaviour 180° based on a simple reddit post, but encouraging (by various different ways) people to do better is worth it even if they change behaviour for only a short period of time.
---
That short period of time will do two things:
---
1) It will "make or break" the game for a few people. Not too many, as you said, the ones who want to have a good time. But also for them, they will have an even better time. But especially for people who might be frustrated about how a certain thing works out, being there to help, even offering to help, might enough to keep them in the game.
---
2) Remind people how nice it is to share knowledge and help others and therefore encouraging them to do it more often. Some of the experienced players will find helping other people rewarding, but never did before.
---
Idk who said it, but it's all about "be the change you want to see in the world".
---
Sounds like something someone from Statics would say.
---
[Kralkatorrik liked that.]
---
what
---
Where is aninsanemaniac's post? i dont see it
---
That's the spirit! Keep up the good work haha!
---
I would like to suggest Condition Soulbeast with Shortbow. Skirmishing 131, Wilderness Survival 313, Soulbeast 232. Use whatever cheap exotic gear you have with Condition damage while slowly getting Ascended Vipers gear. Krait runes for more bleeding.
---
It's not top DPS, but it's good enough in long fights to be acceptable in high-end content. More importantly, you can control the range at which you fight, grant yourself useful boons, siphon life from foes, and have excellent survivability. 
---
For example, I remember doing Hearts and Minds with three teammates, one of the tougher story missions, and even after they all died, I was able to solo the remainder of the fight.
---
I'm really surprised nobody has mentioned that the poor asura necromancer cannot be seen on this picture because he is too small. (He should be below the charr [link](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/9/92/Professions_reveal_12_%28highlighted%29.jpg))
---
&gt; Currently there is no point in using Chain Pull.
---
You state this, and then contradict it by your second finding, which is that Chain Pull should be considered only after placing between six and nine superior flame rams.
---
I don't agree the comparison is valid. Superior Flame Rams should be better than Chain Pull, and you've shown that to be true. Chain Pull should be better than player dps, which is also true. In the time it takes to destroy a gate, what matters is supply usage, and I think you'll find that with those constraints chain pull is in a good place.
---
On your solutions:
---
(I) Warclaw is viable for zergs. It increases the speed at which gates can be destroyed.
---
(II) Warclaw is not intended to replace rams, that was explicitly stated by ANet. If a small scale siege does not have enough supply to place a ram, it should also not have enough supply to destroy the gate with warclaws.
---
(III) sure.
---
Despite my criticisms, great post!
---
So we’re still working on other projects and the ones that got a bunch of people laid off have been “shelved”. As a guild wars 2 player who’s really only interested in gw2 and it’s expansions that sucks to hear.
---
I was planning on making that one. What is the issue with it?
---
All of the humanities pretty much and everything related to it.
---
Base requirement actually proving your claims instead of just accepting some basic assumptions for which there is no prove and using those to claim all you say is true. Just look at the hoax papers they wrote literal bullshit, yet that was accepted and deemed good scholarship, until they found out they did not mean it and then all of a sudden it wasnt. Many papers do not even present proper research, just ideas that are considered true because it has the right political view and enough people in the field support it. When they do have some studies like questionnaires they are all to often skewed to be in favor of the result they want (and yes those are hard, I understand that), as well as reproducibility is rather low often because the selection is bad because.
---
In dungeons for the most part you can take any random shitty build and brute force your way through without any prior knowledge or particular skills. Just keep whacking at those enemies and they'll die. You can't expect the same in raids. You can't walk up to VG and just walk in and kill him. You need to learn mechanics, execute them properly, communicate with the group, etc.
---
Honestly, if they just made a sequel to GW1 I'd be more than happy to give them my business again. 
---
Sadly GW2 turned out very disappointing, as a 8k+ hour GW1 player.
---
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!
---
By the texture-blob minimap that doesn't show clear routes or height scaling? :)

That’s awesome!

I think the raids and fractals to come out in the last 2 years have been enjoyable, for me at least. Mounts too.
---
[Dungeons &amp; Dragons](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085011/?ref_=adv_li_tt) from the mid '80s
---
Someone told me so, but who is funding it? I must say your relationship with NCsoft is pretty obscure to me haha
---
Haha, showing off the true endgame content is amazing. Raids, Fractals, PvP? Nah, fashion wars all the way.
---
But honestly, kudos to you mate!
---
It just has a really low skill floor so people never learn to play it properly in an instanced environment with decent boons &amp; buffs.
---
Several days ago I opened up the GW2 LFG and joined a T4 Fractal group lf "EXP DPS".  I was on my Reaper.  What ended up happening was we got 2 Reapers and 1 DH.  The DH &amp; I were doing about 28-30k DPS.  The other Reaper? 8-9k
---
Legitimately doing 1/3rd as much damage -- meaning that in a high pressure environment they're going to be even more useless.  We didn't kick him or anything, but like... what the hell, man? If you show up to do damage then you need to do more damage than a support Chronomancer.  At least be in the 15-20k ballpark at T4.   
---
In a raid environment you have people dedicated to boons, healing -- you show up for a boss-specific role, DPS, Chrono or Druid/Heals.  Sure, you can bring extra utility along with you, but extra utility isn't going to make up up for significant amounts of missing damage.  Necromancer gets a bad rap for attracting lazy players that don't even try to understand how to take advantage of their class.
---
I think a length and content density about the same as E4, maybe a bit beefier considering how long it's been in the oven, would be ideal. Enough stuff to keep the average player engaged for a couple weeks or so, but in a way that doesn't have too many hard time gates for those who want to get it done as fast as possible.
---
That *could* be intentional, as they have also edited out what looks to be a Sylvari Thief that was between the Elementalist and the Engineer xD
---
Same here!  Took me a while to realize they were asura
---
I had to deal with 90 mithrillum for sunrise so I think I can handle the timegate
---
Nobody wants to attract anyone with a facade. The advertising is doing the attracting. OP is just saying to drop the "we've been playing for six years and you're new here; you're just an outsider" attitude that flows through noticeable portions of the community just beneath the surface.
---
game has like doubled in size and in quality since then
---
&gt; And the writer of the first called the GW2 community a "hate mob" over the firing.
---
There was a hate mob though. There is a reason why this was also at the top of the GG sub. And why there were so many new people posting on this sub all of a sudden. It got really vile really quickly. As always when that group gets involved.
---
Using "snowflake" unironically. *Oh boy, here we go.*
---
Christ he's just asking people to be a little nicer in a video game, why do you gotta make it into such a big deal. Just downvote and move on with your life if you disagree.
---
If they manage the balance between PoF casualness and adventuring spirit and HoTs hardcore meta schedule we are left with the perfect expac. Like, just make 2 PoF style maps and 2 HoT style maps and we are golden
---
I mean, there's levels to anything. That's like saying you can't use the term "I'm in pain" when you have a headache because it's not as bad as a broken set of ribs. You can have mildly traumatic events, traumatic events, and incredibly traumatic things like war scenarios. Losing your source of income overnight unexpectedly is rough too.

We can only hope they do not enter pvp or wvw to fast

Don't tell me what to put on my stick!

Well put list though ;)

Guardian!! Been maining that since launch.. just finished my legendary armor last night. Still my favorite class to play.
---
I would've agreed with this 9 months ago but the lay offs and putting people back on the game makes me hopeful.
---
The game essentially WAS in maintenance mode since POF.
---
Do we really need a reminder like this every 2 weeks or so? Seriously people that are nice to new players are already nice to new players, the ones that are not, are not going to change because of posts like this.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Faction_Provisioner#Bloodbound_Weapons

Any reason one costs 250 tokens? I get that the weapon "levels up with you" but 250 tokens is just insane.

Amazing level design

metas that are very engaging and being played to this day by a huge number of people  
---
Gliders

Actually fun minigames
---
Ah well, at least its clear for OP! :)
---
I mean, we have the mentor tag! It's not supposed to serve as a substitute for not having a com tag ;) Really like that it even shows up in chat as well.
---
But absolutely agree, do you know whether new players are actually made aware of the fact that there's something like "mentors" in the game?
---
Because anet doesn't have a good track of changing old content. 
---
Although this may sound good to new players, you'll be drowning in tomes of knowledge after a few months of playing and the whole "leveling" side of the game can be ignored.
---
All both of them.
---
You already have mentor tag for this and its more visible than title
---
Ah wel at least its clear for OP! :)
---
Considering you are here all the time it makes you a hypocrite
---
It's cool, as a new player I've no idea what you guys are talking about here most of the time anyway.
---
Now that I have seen it, I cannot unsee and must ask... is that a dildo/penis on the post in the upper right near the base?
---
Thank you :) I feel like if the gw2 world was a calmer place my necro would better be able to focus on his research of immortality and lichdom, but with the world as it is he is beginning to understand that his fight against the dragons will eventually claim his life.
---
One more thing I just remembered: if you put up a lfg, *do* say if you want to do a relaxed run with watching cutscenes. Without that in the description, it's generally assumed that you want an experienced party to just rush through the path, skipping where possible.
---
Raids and fractals get played every week/day.
---
These threads are used by people to flex about their "altruism" and also free karma farm. As you mentioned its common occurence here as these people like fake postivity.
---
&gt;Seems a bit much to describe the experience as “trauma” though
---
You wouldn't consider the impending and sudden unexpected loss of ones livelihood to be considered a trauma?
---
Economic balance. On one hand: You'd literally never have to use the TP ever again akin to Legendary quality Weapons and Armor. On the other: Tarir Multimap flooded the economy. We are just begining to rebalance it with Festival of the 4 Winds, Sigil/Run Salvaging, and universal PUIGs, but the cost of Bloodbound Weapons hasn't been readdressed either and just a depreciated system (similiar to how underwater combat was for a while.)
---
If you want *everything*, you will have to purchase PoF + HoT + LWS2 + LWS3 + LWS4. 
---
The LWS chapters are not required for content like Elite Specs or Raids, but if you are interested in story, you will have to purchase them or be left with gaps in the storyline.
---
Thats cheating &gt;:(
---
I'm really hoping to find some at Warsaw now xD
---
It's good for carrying
---
Is there a reason you can't use 64-bit?
---
I don't think I've even *seen* a 32-bit OS being used by a normal consumer for years.
---
I think I understand the distinction you make, my comment was more about glasscannon builds *within* GW2, while yours (and maybe OP's too) seems to be about how GW2's combat in general feels like playing a glasscannon in other MMOs (?)
---
&gt;We don’t and you’re not the arbitor either.

I remember reading that generally people are suspicious or undervalue things that are free. Even charging an incredibly small amount of in this case not saying anything at all gives a better impression. 
---
I could be very wrong.
---
On a druid, it gives you infinite heals on yourself and party.  If you are full harrier druid and you are constantly downing, you're eating every single mechanic.
---
PoF is also at a disadvantage in that when people make alts, its often way easier to get all the needed hero points inHoT. PoF is easier when solo, but everything is also way more spread out (compared to HOT which is small and very quick to run through with mounts).
---
&gt; It was fun being stupid for a bit and having laughs.

That's what it's all about in the end, isn't it? Well done!

You should see those from a post [10 months ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bdqw8z/when_will_this_thing_finally_get_the_consume_all/el2uck1?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x). :D

Not at all.

I asked about love and blind defense of a for-profit company. And no, you didn't shock me.
---
Ok. We need a new topic each time, do we?
---
No, no we don't. We get it. Advertising exists.
---
Exactly, don't have to take everything serious all the time :)
---
I recommend doing the events and making the minimap small. The maps are actually designed around teaching people the layout and are very simple to navigate if you aren't looking at the minimap. 
---
Lots of clever usage of light shafts, wreckage, enemy tracks, airship container placements and so on to lead people through the region. 
---
The most complex of the maps is tangled depths but even that can be boiled down to a few paths and shortcuts. The minimap won't help much, but if you play the area without relying on it you will have a lot more success I guarantee.
---
I'd love that, mentor tag is kind of okay but that would be nice.
---
Only this game’s subreddit gets so worked up about ads, man.
---
you mean the happy ending that completely negated yuna's character development that happened throughout the entire game?
---
X-2 was already crap but fuck me that ending ruined it all
---
no, we don't need more maps to spread the player base even more... utilities the maps and assets we already have instant of throwing away resources, for forcing a new map every god damt living story.
---
Yeah, thanks, we get it. Advertising exists.
---
'Active players' would make it "strong". Which is why it's really just 11 million registered players.

I got my necro (first character) to Lv80, now I'm trying to get exotic gear on him. What should I use to put into the upgrade slots...? All the guides I've seen on MetaBattle seem to only include Ascended gear, and no mention of exotic. Do the slots not matter for Exotic?
---
I read the entire post.  It's just disingenuous to suggest or imply that they can get away with using a garbage weapon like longbow when they're looking for a one-size fits all sort of build. 
---
If he wants to keep a longbow for open world or wvw that's fine.  However, he needs to understand that there is zero practical overlap between the various PvE and PvP game modes
---
Love this esp. the lazy look with their clothes.
---
That Splatoon asura tho...
---
Generally-speaking, people want two things from classes they take into fractals: strong DPS or significanly useful boons. The faster you kill, the faster the mobs die, and the faster they die, the less damage they do to the group (and less chance of having the group screw up in the first place). 
---
Undying power minion master does neither of those things. Most people would rather take a class that can put out a lot more DPS than a necro of any sort, and the fact that they can res everyone fast isn't really a strong point for them, because it's situatonally dependent on having a group that majorly screws up in the first place, which is not what people want. People would much rather breeze through and not screw up in the first place. 
---
Personally, I don't mind having a heal scourge or a power reaper in my group... I'll take anything, so long as the player is making a real effort (aka not just autoattacking and expecting everyone else to carry). I'm just pointing out why a lot of players don't necessarily feel the same way I do.
---
On an unrelated note, are the Living World seasons worth getting? If they are, I might just buy gems, buy the seasons, then trade gems for gold to buy my Exotic gears lol.
---
I'm going to be that guy:
---
I literally have been in a guild with devs. I have been in a guild with *these* devs. Andrew Gray runs Zealots of Shiverpeak, in which I was a member for 10 years and even an officer at points.
---
These people do not break their NDA and their coworkers trust because you are in their guild. At most you're going to get a "Man, work was looong today, but it's some cool stuff." Or *once* I got a "I worked on this next update, tell me what you rhink".
---
Even if every poster was in a guild with devs you're not getting super deep insight.
---
&gt; Just downvote and move on with your life if you disagree.
---
Take your own advise, since you think internet points matter.
---
I, however, do not. I do not downvote, upvote, nor report - having a dialogue is far more important than internet points or having your feelings hurt by what someone says because it goes against your own opinion.
---
Suddenly being unemployed can be considered a trauma for a lot of people.
---
That still doesnt imply it was Kralk who took it or if there was an explosion of it. It could have very much gone somewhere else. Theres still a mystery behind what Aurene had to do.
---
Sweet! I'm only missing Life Siphon and Shield Bash from series 2. I'll look for your ebay post and may pick those up.
---
Did I say it did imply that I just pointed out that according to Zhafirahs story the magic Aurene had has gone thats all.
---
...still lacking enough intellect to actually have a proper dialogue and making a proper counter point, and getting feelings hurt over someone else's words I see.
---
&gt; snowcrows for WvW
---
did i miss that change to the snowcrows page? xd
---
There's a big difference between "some" range and 1200 range.  1200 range puts them well out of range of offensive and defensive QoL buffs and puts them in far more danger.  He's scared, "uncomfortable," whatever you want to call it -- there's no need to sugarcoat it, and there's a certain amount of wisdom in seeing things for what they are -- challenges are not a bad thing.  
---
If he wants to play ranged then he could try a condition setup with Shortbow &amp; Axe/Torch.  However, truly learning the combat system in GW2 is understanding what resources ***in addition*** to your dodges and **range** ^^/s are at your disposal and learning to take advantage of them.  Sword has a huge back-roll on skill 2, an evade on skill 3, and projectile reflection on skill 5.  GS has a built in 3/4s evade frame and a channeled block on skill 4.  SB has an evade on SB3.  Hell, even Axe 4 has an evade.  There are plenty of "tools" that don't require you to stand at 1200 range AFK'ing while you revel over how much damage you *feel* like you're doing.
---
I just checked... I've got them! I'll post my full collection in just a few minutes from @snebzor
---
&gt;I asked about love and blind defense of a for-profit company
---
Well, that's not what's happening here. You're seeing a reasoned response to a strawman.
---
&gt; To put it all dramatic like.
---
I put this bit there so people reading it would know that the phrasing would be a bit over the top.
---
Highly unlikely it'll be a month. They have given us an episode name War Eternal and allowed gaming outlets to break the news of the new mount. I expect a trailer next Tuesday while the welcome back event winds down.
---
Well, they talked about now going back to old maps for LW. Maybe next season we see new areas on existing PoF maps with maybe some extra events and metas
---
The problem though is if the maps are not as fun long term it gets hard to complete collections that depend on events. For example I've seen people wait hours to do Legendary Facet for the griffon. It's fine at release but like I said long term it becomes a barrier to entry for newer players.
---
One its been out since November I think most players know what happens even returning players because they would likely be checking the reddit for updates on the game to see if its okay to come back. Also they didn't release these videos on Monday like they have done every other week for this welcome back event they have given returning players a chance to play.
---
Lol a casual player who just hit 80 knows what ascended gear is, how to get it, and you're implying *already has a full set of it*.
---
Condition Soulbeast calls for Dagger/Torch which would get you that "stand on top of the group/enemy" you're after, but sure bud. Your elitist attitude would work better if you actually knew the weapons used.
---
Challenges aren't a bad thing, neither is wanting a break sometimes to play casually. I get that you're apparently "on" all the time (given your temperament here, is the sass necessary or are you just fuming over nothing and need to vent?). Longbow can give a player some relaxation in open world. Relax dude, it's not that serious and you're treating this game like it must be played one way/your way, or it's the end of the world
---
You might not get that, and you don't need to. My recommendation stands
---
you are literally the first one who failed to recognize the obvious joke name, I applaud your intelligence
---
HMS Divinity will look ridiculous on all but the most silly looking Charr Deadeye.  Predator is a far more serious thematic.
---
I don't understand your comment at all.  
---
How is checking reddit for updates of the game and being spoiled major plot lines of the season the same? Even here we tag spoilers.
---
Also I don't understand your comment about mondays. It's less spoilery on wednesday?
---
It's a source of biased, one sided and probably carefully prepared information. I'm not saying they're lying, but they are not objective source. They are presenting a PR prepared point of view.

Sweet collection! It's the first time I've seen [the full set](http://gw1101.gtm.guildwars.com/events/skillpins.php) in one photo. Well done!
---
Speaking of people not playing in the maps we have, as someone who occasionally plays solo, they really need to stop all the nonsense of required Group Events and have it scale based on how many players are there.
---
Group Events are great and gives a reason for people to cooperate to get a goal done. Problem is, these become more and more impossible as there's less and less people in some of these maps. So sometimes you cannot get an objective done and have to wait for more people, which could take hours. When I'm focused on getting a certain achievement done, realizing I have X amount of hours waiting time makes me want to log out of GW2 and play another game. I hate the feeling, but it's happened to me a few times and I'm sure some can relate.
---
¨My wife didnt get pregnant the first time. Why did I even bother?¨

---
&gt;edit: currently doing the quest, its the most infuriating thing ive seen in this game so far lol

Yup, have fun!

Exactly. If it could at least be the mount with the best opener in PvE. High physical and condition damage. But nooooo...

O nice , I hope the 30th

Conveniently the Karma Converter has the same bags.

ANet has already confirmed multiple times that there will never be a map in the mists, and all of them will be in the "real world".  
---
An instance in the mists for maybe the final fight with Kralkatorrik though is pretty much a given by now.
---
Or Jalis is dead and gone, and since Joko spent some time in the mists already, we can channel his fractal
---
I use my staff weaver occasionally for fractals, open world and wvw.  It might not be the current meta but it does just fine in most places.
---
Coming from a studio that brushed off extended crunch as "part of the job", ANet's culture of a balanced work and home life was a huge draw for me.
---
When I first started I thought they were like Player Moderators **&gt;_&gt;**

Something else I found interesting in the vision cinematic, it ends with branded crystals shattering, is this Aurene breaking free perhaps? It may just be a visual effect for the cinematic, but I'm not sure why else a branded crystal would be exploding.
---
That should tell you something :)
---
I'm hoping this means they're waiting until they're nearing the finale of the story they wish to tell before they start work on a new project.
---
haha don't take it too seriously
---
Yeah that's more than likely what I'll do.  Born again noob. A nooborn. Noobborn? Eh whatever.
---
100+ FPS on 3440x1440 best looking settings. Better hardware would spice your shit up!
---
Also, these videos are specifically designed and marketed as a "welcome back" campaign.
---
Thank you!
---
There's not really a line I'm drawing here, to be honest. It's just a hunch that I have, which might as well be nonsense and Aurene is dead for good, or there are other things which leads to her coming back to live.
---
Was looking for something that didn't follow a schedule, something I could do if I wanted to pop in for 20 mins and wanted to farm something.
---
Will never not love [3D](http://www.nojamtoday.com/10_years_of_comics/3d_in_comics_1.jpg) for these things.
---
I was just killing the fleshreaver elites (2) and stepping out to make them resplendent faster.
---
You are right, there are some questionable designs in HOT as well, though I think they are are easier to avoid if you don't want to engage them, than the frustrating mobs in POF.
---
Maybe it's just because for the first time I really experience Jahai Bluffs (when it released I just played the story and then took a break). But from Jacarandas that pop up everywhere, mostly ranged branded mobs  packed so tightly that you chainpull six of them when one targets you (in addition there is that hydra event that nobody cares to do anymore, the pre of which nevertheless effectively blocks the southwestern corridor of the map every 20 minutes or so) - it's been a lot of time I just shut down the client out of fatigue from the BS I was encountering. It also doesn't help that I'm trying to finish the achievements for Kourna and every time I do the meta event, I get pissed off and can't believe they chose to release it in such a state and still haven't reworked it enough that it isn't a complete waste of time :)
---
I took that as a symbolic representation of her resolve/courage/whatever. 
---
Something showing us that she cannot take it anymore. Not a real branded crystal.
---
You've heard the expression "don't feed the troll?" That refers to the idea of engaging trolls on their bad motive topic. For example, this whole fake vs. not-fake dichotomy? It's complete bullshit. You know it's complete bullshit. You're fabricating controversy. We won't be having that conversation. Maybe we should talk about what you're doing in this community and why you're trying to undermine a genuine sense of goodwill?
---
Another note is that the longest part of ascended gear (armor and weapons) is that they take time-gated account-bound materials to craft. There are 4 different ones and each can be crafted once per day. The bound items themselves can't be traded, but the items you make with them *can* be traded - see deldrimor steel, spiritwood planks, bolts of damask, or elonian leather squares. Those are sold for about 5-6 gold on the marketplace, but you need a lot of it for a whole armor set (55-60) and weapons (3-5 per 1).
---
Backpieces, trinkets, necklaces, and the like can be purchased with laurels (log-in bonus currency) or via achievements. :)
---
What is really annoying about this? HoT had the same issue. There was a huge patch that made it worthwhile, maybe even multiple patches did this. They have yet to do this to PoF. Really sad considering I thoroughly enjoyed my PoF time but find it hard to return after finishing Gryphon and a few skins/collections.
---
He was talking about Tyria. He knows nothing about game world and history.
---
They never said never, just that it was unlikely unless it really fit the story. So I wouldn’t rule it out. Is it likely? Probably not, but nothing I have seen eludes to it being an impossibility.
---
Maybe you're right, I just found the idea cool and thought I could share :P.
---
I'm fine with both ideas personally (simply killing him or imprisoning him in a fractal) as I'm very curious about what the effect of killing yet another dragon would be on Tyria anyway!
---
That's the spirit! Ive made nevermore. Farming Elder Wood still makes me chuckle.
---
Technically you don't *need* to follow a commander around for SW. You can just join squad, join their instance, leave squad, profit. No following to be had since you can tag stuff at your leisure.
---
I did all w2 tribulation skins this year and yet I died to fingers every time. It's insane lol. Now I am ready for world 3 collection!
---
&gt;Also. I've a theory about how this map will actually be a "Fractal Prison" for Kralk, where Aurene and Glint will fight Kralk for eternity in a sort of loop like all fractals. Effectively defeating him without destroying him and destabilizing Tyria further. This would also be like the "Dragon's Stand" of PoF. I think that would be a dope tie in of game mechanics and storytelling.
---
I know a lot of people are theorizing this but... I really hope this isn't it. Ripping a plot point from Dr. Strange will feel lazy.
---
My theory on "War Eternal" isn't that he's caught in a loop. I think the title is actually referencing the grander scale: The Eternal Alchemy, and how the dragons would wake up, wage war with living races, kill them, and this would repeat.
---
I think part of the story will be us realizing that this has happened more than twice. It's happened over and over and over again, extinction after extinction, and episode 6 is the moment we're left with no choice but to kill Kralkatorrik without a replacement or die. Season 5 will be the fallout of that decision, and the beginning of the end of Tyria.
---
Note that before the layoffs happened, the GW2 twitter was sending out timed tweets of lore for each of the gods, and the BLTC weapon set (which might have originally released alongside episode 6) is themed after the gods and is called "Defiant". I think these are in reference to us finding out who the gods really are, and either acting in defiance of them or the Eternal Alchemy.
---
&gt;when a company does a press release it's always going to have pr connotations to it.
---
Just curious, what other connotation would you expect a press release to have?
---
The problem /u/S_K_Y have isn't that he doesn't want players around to play with him. The problem is that there is no players around to play with him as almost no one wants to play old content anymore.
---
He would like to see a reduction of Group events to downgrade into regular events. So that he could actually complete the content. Regular events in general are group friendly even if they are soloable. Telling him "This is a MMO" won't change the fact no one will be around to help him complete the content.
---
if you mean you only have access to core classes and want to play healer i think ele is the better choice.
---
Ranger is still the default choice for heal, the boon firebrand/renegade becomes more used in fractal and raids tho.
---
So what is the story behind all of these? I saw the other post, but would love to hear you expand on it a bit!
---
Another top post here recently calculated the total gold requirements for this, and it ends up being several times the ammount for PvE legendary armor. Not to mention requiring about 20hours a week for months just grinding claim tickets.
---
Finish all the story missions first! 
---
By the way, the story telling gets much better with HOT. Everything after Living World S2 is fully voice acted, even your character.
---
Also you have lots of PVE content with the new maps. Open world is doable solo and you don‘t have to PVP. It‘s a bonus gamemode since gw2 is pve oriented
---
Achievement points, fun experiences, moto's bauble infusions. You won't necessarily be getting much gold out of SAB
---
No one escapes fashion war, trust me.
---
If recently made fractal level 100 a goal for myself, currently at 96, so here's my two cents:
---
1. Choose one class and perfect it
---
2. Learn about fractals, read about fractals and and and.
---
For 1) I would suggest power dragonhunter ([https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/power-dragonhunter)), as it is quite easy to play and it offers you to switch to support firebrand quite easily. Also, dragonhunter is relatively easy to play and at the same time quite rewarding (personal opinion here). Go to the golem in the raid training area (you can find that in Lion's Arch - Aerodrome) and try to hit as hard as you can, aiming for at least 15-20k dps with the correct settings enabled. Practice rotation, but also understand skill priority. It honestly isnt too hard to begin with, just do it slowly and crack up the speed once you have it in the muscles.
---
Power DH also comes with rather good defensive abilities (aegis on F3, block on focus 5) and nice CC, which usually helps the overall group performance.
---
Support classes would definitely be Chrono or Druid, maybe heal scourge (not too popular at experienced T4 tho, as it doesnt bring too many party buffs or dps).
---
For 2) I think you are doing a good job already, consulting various sources and reddit, so just keep up the good work :) Another tip maybe: Snowcrows have some additional information on classes and rotations. Even though they are talkin about raiding, the general rotations really similar to fractals, most often only the gear differs. (E.g. [https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/dragonhunter/power/](https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/guardian/dragonhunter/power/) )
---
Take a look at this pretty good summary done a bit further down.

Dang. I wish I had those tbh.
---
Then your sense in this case is pretty severely warped. 
---
A majority even in western civilisation are living month to month and heavily rely on their salary to support themselves and their family. Homelessness exists even with those otherwise capable of contributing to society, There are heightened rates of suicide in these situations for a reason.
---
Safety nets or not the loss of a job, especially in a specialised industry that often requires relocation, alongside a large number of your peers vying for the few same roles can be a serious issue. Even here in the UK where we have social unemployment benefits it's a big problem.

I won some of these in various online contests and got some off ebay. Back in the day, they were only handed out at various conventions around the globe. I've just been a big fan of the game for a long time. I have a pretty crazy collection of Guild Wars merch (including artwork, signed stuff, the books, all the collectors editions, posters, stuffies, magazines, fan stuff, promo material from game stores, etc.)
---
Of all the stuff I've collected, these and my nightfall cardboard standee are my favorite!
---
I'd throw in a quick bit about how weapons are classed condi/power. Axes and torches are almost exclusively condi, swords stack weakness, etc.
---
I'd love giant dragon world bosses, it's my favorite part of the game and as far as I could tell there wasnt really any big world events in the default maps, like I'm sure there were but map chat never told me about anything when I asked
---
This game is geared towards the OP wants but the Fashion war is the darkside and will get you no matter what x\_x. Plus the amazing combat... and ... did I mention FASHION WITH THE COMBAT WHAHAH!!!
---
That's super cool! Thanks for sharing! I wish they did stuff like this more often.
---
You need to look at it from the perspective of a guild with limited slots. You want to keep a community active, which means you want players that will talk to other players, players who do activities with the guild (missions, wvw, raids, whatever else), and players that represent the guild so that they can also help it grow. If you don't have *some* sort of gkick standard, your guild list becomes a ghost town and the guild experience is "3/170 players online and nobody talks in /g".
---
No guild actually wants or needs *numbers*. If all you are is a number (one more player in the guild, whoopee), you provide no benefit to that guild. They don't get anything out of having you around if you're not socializing with them and participating in guild events or playing with other guildies.
---
South has longest burn time, that's why they tend to kill it.

---
Hence my post 2 hours ago
---
No, not at all, just happened to coincide, so I just used it as a mark to when I stopped playing. I mostly stopped due to burnout, as I had played pretty much nothing else for months
---
right, I don't think this new hypothetical monk-esque class should just be reserved for any new race that debuts alongside it, just that - in terms of lore - the new race "created" the class and then taught the other races are to become that class.
---
Other than damage control? Promotion? Not sure I understand the question.  All in trying to get at is I can't 100% trust an employee doing an interview with a major publication since they'll always be some bias you wouldn't get from somebody no longer invested in it. Still not sure why this warrants negative internet points for not blindly white knighting these kind of articles but should probably expect it posting on the sub for the game. Played this for 4000 hours so by no means have a negative view on the company, just trying to highlight that you aren't going to see a single negative point in an article with press when you're still employed by them.

I'm half convinced it was just to give us those memes.
---
PvE is by far the love child of this game.
---
I often feel a little bad for people who primarily PvP or WvW, because PvE just clearly gets 90% of the love.
---
I agree with others. You won't escape fashion wars. You might not think you'll want to. But eventually you'll get to a point where you're like "Well I'm pretty good at my class...I've got the best gear...hmmm, now it's time to make him look gud".
---
I clear Raid Wings 1-4 twice a week and Fractals daily. I'm starting to branch into Wings 5 and 6 when I have time. All of that is end-game PvE content. I love it still, I'm yet to be bored of it.
---
The game is super PvE friendly : )
---
Not that I have anything against this call to action, I just got to shout out that what kept me in GW2 after returning 4 years after launch was the amazingly helpful community. Aside from the PvP Discord I am randomly apart of, I've not seen much in terms of toxicity on reddit or really in game. 
---
Granted I come from a background of DOTA2, Overwatch, and R6, so almost anything is less toxic lol
---
As others have said, for dungeons, no healer is needed.
---
For Fractals and Raids, Druid is absolutely meta. And in case you didn't know, Druid is an elite specialization of Ranger.
---
It takes a while to get proper Druid gear though. Just keep that in mind : ).
---
Crafting will be the easiest way to get Druid gear for a new player who doesn't raid.
---
Any particular item i can exchange the baubles for?
---
Really? Unless I'm mistaken, that's about the time yall got a new marketing director and started reaching out to us about how to better market the game, no? Really happy to see that you guys took all of it to heart, and not just the stuff about the episode trailers :)
---
Metabattle.com I feel like you have your own opinion for what makes a class broken compared to the rest so look them up on there to see what people are using as you want for your playstyle.  Short answer is guardian or mesmer though, with guardian favouring offensive in pve and support in pvp while mesmer is the opposite
---
Don't pretend you don't don't have 30 fps in encounters
---
Thanks! Follow up question, to be sure can I buy any (non China) key (from trusted seller) that I want? 
---
E.g. if I live in Italy can I use a USA/UK key?
---
Is there any guide on how to play heal druid on Raids? I've been having moderate success in T4 fractals with mine, but I feel like I'm just mashing buttons at random and it somehow works
---
Heal ren takes Devastation / Salvation / Renegade - you want Devastation for Assassin’s Presence, and Salvation for increased healing output.
---
Legends are Kalla/Ventari. Healing is done through Kalla heal skill + elite, and Ventari utility Natural Harmony (which also gives a bit of alacrity when you’re taking Salvation).
---
If you’re curious about trying it out, you can check out the “rotation” on Snowcrows’ website - its really just spamming F4, F2, and heal skills while legendswapping whenever possible.
---
Balance changes can make some radical changes, for the better or worse. I'd ignore what's *hot* right now and play what you generally enjoy, because it could be nerfed by the time you hit 80.
---
oh, yes, once you completely geared your first character and start the end game content more characters will follow shortly because the high end content is quite rewarding. But the way to the first character is going to feel like it will take forever.
---
Ooooof the GOAT response. So, to clarify, im not elitist and never have been but I know what it's like to pug and i know what a nightmare is can be to be pug and lately i know what it's like to be constantly guild hopping because certain devs decide it's a good idea to implement a slot machine for gear distribution and kill the gold economy making end game content more of a chore than something enjoyable.
---
I just want something that i can take everywhere. It really sounds like Mesmer is in a fantastic place but as other people stated, it's hard as shit to be a good mesmer. You definitely make a great point for creating one though.
---
Ok but they announced gen2 legendaries &amp; a major WvW overhaul with HoT &amp; now, 4 years later, we are receiving one &amp; half the other. I realize the promises were before Mike O'Brien, but I don't think we can dismiss the current pace of meaningful delivered content as "any game is going to have that". 
---
You're also drawing parallels between content PROMISED to be delivered and content you've made up in your own head-canon. No, we shouldn't get excited over wild speculations but it'd be nice if we got something other than a story episode that a good deal of players don't care to play through &amp; a map that dies 3 months after its release. Compare this to FF14 that gets practical mini-expansions every few months or WoW that gets new raid releases multiple times a year.
---
What's this?
---
I like to farm bloodstone fen.  Takes about 5 min per character.  I convert the rubies to unbound magic and buy mistwarped bundles.  I can get like 5 per day with 2 chars.  It’s a gamble but seem to earn an average of 1g per bundle over time  (20s to 4g each), plus mystic clovers which is my main goal in farming them.
---
Right so im trying to... smooooooooth out that transition.  Hence this straight forward, just-tell-me-wtf-to-play topic lol. Thanks for the input
---
Yep sorry that it read that way. In fact when Linsey cut in to interrupt thats what actually made me think 'what were they about to say!? Did they just stop their colleague saying something they shouldn't?'. I'm just super pessimistic about the media 😁😁
---
Man I missed it *cries*
---
I mean idk lol right now im that guy strafing and jumping around killing level 10 elites. It's just a lot of the FAQs and resources out there point to the whole "play what you want" mentality which is fantastic for people but i've been burnt in the past by other balanced game that said "ok. 2 classes are good now. rest are trash. good luck"
---
Give me more fresh players so that I may teach them the magic of Break Bars.
---
I switch to best performance during world bosses etc. That shit lowers the fs for sure.
---
I dig it too, too bad I don’t need it or I would craft it too.
---
Does anyone have more than 50/1000 AP on the SAB "Annual Nostalgia" achievement?
---
It gives 50 AP per year, but was already around last year, too, wasn't it? I'm absolutely sure I did it last year, and this year as well. It still says 50 AP instead of 100.
---
Well that's actually true, i've always seen draconis mons as one of the most intricate maps and difficult to navigate. But doing aurora was a nice way to like the feeling of the map: nature at its finest. Anyway, i won't miss that map.
---
The state of sPvP/WvW would lead people to believe that they don't care for it.
---
I've played for three years. I'm proud to be around 10. You have talent.
---
Given the infinity ball story and the idea of having an alternate-dimension self, and anyone having a sufficiently powerful enough footprint in the mists, I'd say it could be possible. Kind of a cool legend idea, to be honest.
---
why? why would anyone have fun for a longer period of time if they know everything? to look around maybe ?
---
We've come to bargain?
---
You want to farm mobs off schedule that drop good loot? Or is the loot optional? I don't think so, what would be the point if there was no loot? But if there were any kind of rewarding loot to a mob ... we wouldn't be doing events in the first place. So no, there is no decent reward tied to mobs greater than any meta event out there.
---
But still, I might have something for you.
---
Many years ago when Magic Find was still a gear stat, I had a farming place killing mobs for [Vials of Powerful Blood](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vial_of_Powerful_Blood) and other T6 mats. They still sell for 40s and the drop rate hasn't changed that much because I still get at least 1 when waiting for Claw of Jormag.
---
The mob is [Arctodus](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arctodus) in [Trionic Lattice](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Trionic_Lattice). You can begin with that, and have some fun in the wiki searching for other mobs that drop T6 mats, and make your own farming routes (remember diminished returns).
---
I never made a route because ... well, events do their job fine to me.
---
Good luck!

Healbrand tank on SH is SUPER easymode.  If you were going to run a minstrel chrono, using a minstrel FB is a really strong swap.
---
If you were going to run commander-ish chrono, a trailblazer FB will do quite a bit better damage for most players with similar survivability.
---
If you would normally play a condi trailblazer-ish chrono build.  You're probably not planning to take advice from random people on reddit as you most likely already have your shit together.
---
Okay, class opinions are fine, but if you  are the "ex wow player" you might not understand how easy it is to pick up, gear and learn a new character here. And it is very easy, so if you want to "be always welcome in groups", you really, really should multiclass instead of trying to sit on a multiple chairs with a single ass. 
---
So start with a guardian, it is currently a very easy and pretty powerful dps class for most pve encounters (but not all, there are few where you will be *expected* to have a certain dot-based builds, see whatI'm talking about?), but don't tunnel on it too hard.
---
quality over quantity
---
I'm the odd man out playing mirage while everyone's sitting in the cool chrono's club.
---
Yeah it's worth it, but personally I'd couple it with a lore search on the wiki to get an appreciation of the story. And know that the story telling improves with each one, I found the vanilla story was very meh with a cool ending, HOTS was overall better and then improved again with POF, hope this helps

[Frontliner Soulbeast](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vNAQNAnXRnE8CtCid8CO8Cs8ilCBLP7udHvPdhZQAg5dV1SdpQbLT7A-jlB4ABkq+DA7P4jyulUCaqSBP0HAA-w)
---
Here a better Dps Soulbeast IMO. It didn't rely at all on Rapid Fire burst and have better potential to burst down opponents. It provide support to the group too, have self buff and survivability.
---
Sure it's not the best build but it playable for a melee train squad.
---
Farming mobs isn't really a thing.  The game discourages it generally.  Farming mobs you will eventually risk the game's anti-farm mechanic kicking in, which will kill your loot drops.   That said, I'm often in the same boat.  I have a bit of time to kill but I can't commit.  Therefore, it's better to places where you can do multiple things at once, ie events, gathering nodes, killing, etc.  
---
Good choices are:
---
* Dailies - Doing three for 2 gold is usually pretty trivial (&lt;5 mins), plus the chests.
---
* Silverwastes - No one is going to care if you jump in for a bit and leave.  Also, there is no need to follow a commander.  In fact, RIBA is better if people spread around the map to ensure all four camps are kept safe.  Your prime reward will be events and bags, which will far out way what you kill.
---
* Gathering - It can make a lot of money.  Good value resources can get money fast (elder wood, flax, platinum, etc) for low effort.  This is really true if you have portal scrolls, which makes jumping fast and free.  You can also gather things to turn into unstable magic, which is good for packets.  Generally, unstable magic is worth about 6c/per.  And, glyphs on your tools can maximize your return on time.  A common run for me is home instance, guild hall, Siren's Landing, Malcor's Leap, Bloodstone Fen, Verdant Brink, Dry Top, Brisban Wilds.  Gather wood, chests, mithril, flax, jungle plants, oysters, etc.
---
* WvW - As long as you engage now and then to keep your participation up (ie. take a depot, kill a guard), the reward track is on a timer.  The legendary track rewords obsidian and clovers, plus other things.
---
But for those *in* that guild who *want* constant interaction, it's exactly what they want. That's what the guild is for. And I know you've shot this down pre-emptively but if that experience isn't what *you* want, then you won't join them. You have no need to care about them, and they have no need to care about you.
---
&gt; "Nobody's ever asked me to work overtime"
---
Like for real, nobody does. They just remind you that your shiny yearly bonus (raise, new project, etc) is not in your pocket yet. On the other hand if studio in that apathetic state, that nobody press overtime when shit need to be done, no wonder build templates takes 6 years to implement...
---
That's tricky. Closest thing I can think of is a class that has SS tier support, S tier damage, and is generally a blast to play regardless of the content. Not sure if that exists.
---
Btw, are there any specific dialog lines with Rytlock in HoT story if the commander is revenant as well?
---
While there is technically a point to use it, I have not seen this many rams placed down at once.
---
There's a lot a like about all the different classes. Just makes it hard to stick to only one. My main thing I enjoy in MMOs is being helpful. Having skills/utilities that benefit others. For instance I enjoy Revenants faucet abilities but I've never gotten to it since it's an elite spec. I enjoy using movement increasing abilities since I know not everyone owns a mount. I used to play a warrior and would pick up banners just use the increased movement speed bonus in new character areas. I recently found out I can't do that anymore which kinda makes me not like the warrior as much :/
---
Don't overdo the leveling part, because once you've established yourself in the game, there are plenty of ways to level up additional characters without doing boring hearts for hours. Maybe one character is fine to level up in the general pve, learning the basics and enjoying vanilla gw2 in it's 7 years old glory, but after that there will be much better ways. 
---
Getting into raiding is easy gameplay-wise (to make your guardian raiding-ready you literally need to spend the equivalent of 2-3 hours of pve, as long as you know what to do, and maybe few more hours to gear it up to a level few percents below maximum), but might be more difficult socially. Since physically getting into raiding is that easy and this game is full of, uhm, ""casual"" players, experienced people have a great distrust to the general population. So you'd better impress someone and start making connections, lest you want to spend weeks in "training" runs where only 10% of people are actually willing to train.  New raid wings is supposed to be released somewhat soon and that might be a good chance. All that assuming you yourself are ready to git ~~gut~~ at least somewhat mediocre, because this is all that this game will ask from you.
---
I was legitimately arguing for breathing room, what are you on about?  I suggested Shortbow &amp; Axe/Torch *because* both are 900 range weapons which puts players in a far more likely position to receive important QoL boons while still being effectively "ranged." 
---
It's interesting how I always seem to get labeled an, "Elitist," when I'm really not.  I'm the sort of person that enjoys helping people; I don't rant or criticize people -- I'll just quietly expedite someone on their way to their Sunrise, Twilight, Frostfang -- whatever.  I enjoy watching people empower themselves w/ better builds.  I don't force them down people's throats, but I like it when they make informed decisions that lead to them becoming a more independent player.  
---
I think that weapon-sets like longbow, while fine for relaxation, build bad habits that creates a "lone wolf," mentality in instanced PvE.  I spend a lot of my time carrying people through various tier Fractals; T1-T4, and every so often I transfusion someone that finds some way to die in some obscure corner.  It's silly. With 25 might being a **30-35%** DPS boost there's no reason not to play around someone providing might for you unless you're super serious about your role playing.  
---
Being at ranged does not mean that you're "safer" and creates all sorts of issues with various boss aggro in GW2.  If you want to use ranged weapons in GW2 then you should opt for mid-range options with no more than ~ 900 range in order to receive boons.  This is true in the open world as well.  Condition Ranger was a thing before Soulbeast during the HoT days.   Surely, you've done Molten Boss with the Firestorm or Berserker flying every which way because some player is obsessed with ranging him? Try it.  
---
We're not going to agree with one another, and I don't see the point "acting" nice.  I read your opinions, but I won't pretend to respect them and neither will you.  I've never agreed with you about almost anything, and *surprise* I've had you blocked before too.  I can't fault you for not knowing about condition ranger -- one of the most popular, easy to play condition builds before Soulbeast came w/ Path of Fire. 
---
It was Shortbow &amp; Axe/Torch, and I'd wager it's still a pretty beginner friendly ranged option.  You get the added novelty of tossing axes like a lumberjack and you have 2 distinct quickdraw options in Axe 2 (Split Blade) and Bonfire (Torch 5).  Use Axe 2 when you think a mob is going to move around a lot.  Use Bonfire when you think you'll be able to get better value out of a fire field.  Simple. 
---
I'm not particularly "angry" so much as a little frustrated and annoyed.  I completely understand wanting an idle weapon-set or something to relax on, but in the context of a one-size fits all build **I don't trust players to adapt to content.**  I don't think that people that ask for builds are looking to swap weapons, traits -- whatever.  They *say* they are, but they don't know *how* and when you don't know how to do something most people are too embarrassed to ask and continue to embrace ignorant mediocrity.

It just really makes me think of "What if you (and this campaign) had come along just half a year earlier"...
---
Nevertheless it's good that you and "your" campaign are here *now*.
---
Did you check the second location? I found him there.
---
No man even for quick runs i'd consider healscourge a bit of a wasted slot. If you have really inexperienced players that die from every mechanic out there and you play healscourge this still means that youre party will lack boons (if no other healer present). As for your average pug, they would alwasy want either a druid/chrono comp or healbrand/renegade comp if you want both boons and heals.
---
Thank you so much. So proud of the work of the ArenaNet Marketing Team and the support of our community.
---
Elementalist then, can be healer, highest dmg on teams most of time if using the correct build, but u can exceed on both,must choose one build, healing or dmg, u can also look on metabattle for druid condi builds, a pretty nice class, a must have healer on group content.
---
I WvW a bit with my hubs. I prefer to just run around and do whatever.
---
really depends on your definition of 'major', but [theres also that charr in the elon riverlands](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gorea_Halfcut)
---
Makes sense. The two weapon skills are neat but looking at the locked skills probably underpowered.
---
I WvW a bit with the hubs. But mostly prefer just to run around and do whatever.
---
Ah well then have fun with it XD
---
I'm conflicted on this. PoF was my favorite content in Guild Wars 2 by far the first couple of times through and I couldn't stop playing.
---
The nice and quiet areas are a big part of what made it so great for me compared to HoT.
---
On the other hand, I get it, I also don't return to PoF anymore.
---
TBH I would prefer another amazing expansion like PoF that I can put 100-200 hours in completing every achievement and enjoy immensely, compared to HoT which I enjoy but never had that feeling of awe in. Preferably, they have 3-4 maps like PoF, and 1-2 maps that have an amazing meta that is replayable.
---
I know that's probably an unpopular opinion for hardcore players, but for me PoF was just that much better than everything else that even if it isn't that replayable it's worth it.
---
Go join a HoT HP run. They have them fairly often and you should be able to max it out within an hour. It's not worth swapping over until you're maxed or near maxed depending on builds.
---
How bad was it?
---
This is their last effort to save their company lol, once the advertising budget runs out its game over.

That is a duplicate ticket to 7293566 and was closed because we only work on one ticket for one issue. Sending more than one ticket will always result in the ticket simply being shuttered when we see it.

I opened two exact tickets for the same issue on two different accounts within a minute of eachother.

Unfortunate truth. If it doesn't cater to shitters and ultra-casuals, it's not a focus of the dev team. They know who their cash cows are.

I didn’t take the time to read the whole thread to see if anything of what I am going to say has been said already, so if it had been said already then I apologize. 
---
From my experience with going back and forth between WoW since TBC and GW2 since release I would tell you, don’t compare them. There really isn’t the true trinity of all other mmo’s of tank, healer, Dps. There is to an extent but in the way that WoW does. The combat couldn’t be farther from what WoW is with the movement and dodging that you have to do. As far as comparison with classes as far as types of combat and skills they have. It’s fairly self explanatory. Necro=warlock, elementalist=mage, warriors, and so on. 
---
As far as meta classes, as others have said already, are kind of ever changing and depends on the game mode you play. From my experience, which is primarily WvW, has been that Guardians have and probably will always in some fashion just because of what they have to offer. As far as the other classes they seem to come and go from the current meta depending on the build. But I can also say is that leveling multiple toons is not hard and gearing isn’t terrible either. With that said adapting to future meta’s is not a hard challenge to keep up with. 
---
Tl:Dr personal experience with playing both, they don’t compare. Guardian has seemed to be in the meta since release. Fairly easy to stay in meta with easy leveling and gearing.
---
Literal oppression in the name of social justice. There is no use arguing if all you say is oh but that wasnt social justice because what they didnt was but and obviously social justice is good. A lot of this shit happens as part of social justice, if you want to talk about it be honest and acknowledge that there is a lot of bad things done as social justice.
---
Social justice is not universally a source for good, and its frankly not getting better. Being blind for the bad parts only furthers the bad elements because they can get away with it. Want people to not consider social justice negative? CLEAN YOUR HOUSE.

A person can dream!

I played druid on my first and only 100 cm with guild mates who do it regularly. I have never felt so useless as in this run.
---
In dungeons and low level fractals being a Druid certainly is somewhere between subpar and terrible, though in tier 4 fractals and such a Druid is very much wanted.
---
Yet gameplay wise completely different. 
---
There is no game that plays like GW1.
---
That was embarassing. Don't remind me
---
I can identify with your reasoning, however I would have loved to play the class I enjoy while feeling usefull during most  of the facets of the game rather holding off until very specific circumstances.  And from what I hear,even then a team can do just fine without a druid.
---
Dungeons are fine if you want exotic gear, but if you don't feel like running dungeons, the trading post is a good place to start, looking at the [named](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Named_armor) armor sets, or the [temple](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Temple_armor) armor sets if you have more karma than gold right now.
---
Erm cms druid helps a lot for spirits and might alone, even without heal that is. With heal even more helpful.
---
&gt; And from what I hear,even then a team can do just fine without a druid.
---
Can do fine, sure. The important thing to understand though is that many people aren't good enough to do just fine. Unless you're absolutely certain that your party can burst down fast enough and can survive the mechanics, a druid is always a valuable option in higher level content.
---
I am living proof of this. I claimed stuff just like OP, and there I was yesterday spending tons of gold (for me) to get dyes ;)
---
I .... don't see your point. How not being an asshole should be a facade ? Should we support people to behave like ones if they like/want it ? That's not sane for society.
---
I didn't ask to include newbies blindly in groups nor spending your time with them. Just to not treat them like plague, and maybe indicate how they can reach their goals to join.
---
as "journalists" (regarding eurogamer, i use the term *very* loosely) they have a responsibility to fact check and make sure they are reporting what is **actually** happening. not what they think is happening, just the reality. they have to be held to a higher standard than a bunch of people commenting on an internet board because it's their job and they don't deserve to report the news if they aren't willing to check their facts. they are exactly the type of company that give us all this fake news bullshit in the first place
---
Because of the color of their skin and if they didnt they got harassed thank you very much. Its pure racism and if you are not willing to take that up when its done in the name of social justice then it deserves the negative view there is and a lot more. Racism is good if we do it? Congrats you are the racist.
---
Going agree on the other guy that said anything above tier 1 and 2, peeps would die to have a druid. T1 and 2 are speedrunfest, can outdps foes solo yoloham no need a might stack pre boss even.
---
You get it exactly and thank you.
---
I like playing with others and getting things done but sometimes yeah, that's out of my control. Granted it also doesn't help me that I work nights, so I get off work and the peak hours of game time is over.
---
Keep in mind that "hard" is relative to the game. This is a very easy game, to be honest. Our easiest classes are much easier than anything in wow. Our hardest classes aren't any harder than wow's harder classes. People will tell you that Mesmer is hard, but it isn't, truly. I've taught people to play a passable support Mesmer (Chronomancer) that upkept its relevant group buffs, with just 15 minutes of explanation.
---
When people tell you a class is "hard", they usually mean one of the following:
---
1. it has a long rotation that's hard to memorize outright, but easy to comprehend as a combination of various skill interactions
---
2. it relies on you inputting skills very quickly with no pauses
---
3. it relies on you counting autoattacks, as every third autoattack is very strong, so you want to use skills only after the third autoattack completes
---
Mesmer is considered "hard" because it is heavily dependent on all 3. However, objectively, none of these 3 things are actually that hard.
---
I just built out a Harrier druid and it's fun to play support after playing mostly DPS since launch. In more experienced groups, I'm able to stay on Axe/Warhorn for most fights, only really using CA to upkeep might or cleanse conditions. In this case, I can do some pretty decent dps with the ricochet, might, fury, spotter, bleeds on crit, and the quick recharge of warhorn 4 on swap when I don't have to constantly fear for a party member dropping to an easily avoidable mechanic.   
---
However, in less experienced groups, and on more difficult fractals like Twilight Oasis or Siren's Reef, especially when the instabilities are all horrible like Social Awkwardness, We Bleed Fire, and Frailty, those are the circumstances where I really feel like I carry groups. However, playing with very good players is like night and day compared to your average pugs and I recognize that, while sometimes more annoying, most content in this game is completely do-able without  Druid, Chrono, FB, or Renegade support. There's really no point in having a healer or support in fractals before T4/CMs. That's when people should be learning the combat mechanics and improving their class skill so they don't even need a healer. Druid is definitely still desirable in some group content, but it was never necessary.
---
well, you **are** talking about it.

*looks around* still waiting for the circle jerk thread

I have yet to see one there.

Meanwhile, in the real world people are murdering people over the color of their skin. But yeah, I guess it’s sad one stupid college did something fucking stupid once. 
---
Like yes, it was bad, it was fucking stupid, they should not have done that. But if that is the worst that’s happened, I think I could live with it.
---
Just buy commanders tag... random people would always show up.
---
Bitterfrost should have never had that ice wall/potion requirement thing. That entire section of the map is a) a chore to get to, b) segments the map and makes it feel unnatural and c) cumbersome to "explore", especially before mounts. It should have required it once for the initial story, then let you "interact" with it after and just pass through.
---
Yeah i saw mesmer is a lot less of a direct class rotation and more about encounter interaction and setup which is cool but it sounds like you really need to know what the hell youre doing.
---
Guardian &gt; Firebrand elite spec is great in everything. I dont do much PvE anymore so I don’t know, for WvW though please bring Firebrand! You can never have too many Firebrands! (Rangers do not exist there)
---
What the fuck is this even supposed to mean?
---
Inconsequential as a character, but a good lad nonetheless.
---
They weren't even full sentences, and it was a self-absorbed, knee-jerk response that doesn't take into account the inference made by the adjective "strong" - there's nothing strong about an account that hasn't been touched in 5 years, and they're counting those among the 11 million. Fallacy.
---
I would say it depends on a few factors:
---
Like you and others mentioned in T1 you can easily do without a healer. If you go up to T4 and then still don't need a healer you might want to consider soulbeast. However it is also very dependent on the fractal and fractal instabilities that day. Sometimes I have runs (I usually play Healbrand) where I absolutely think I could have gone quickbrand after we completed the fractal. But sometimes having the extra heals gives players the feeling that they can just focus on dps not interrupting rotations at all for things they otherwise should have dodged. The same goes for druid. Druid still brings spirits which is still party dps. You still provide might, fury, regen and swiftness. Condition clear is underrated (while druid has not that much it still is valuable)  
---
So my advice is, go higher first, keep playing druid. Then when your group reaches T4 and feels confident, try out Soulbeast once in a while and compare. See if you're lacking boons/heals and go from there.
---
I'm totally with you that those uninvited followers create problem in WvW community/guild. I have statics groups in WvW arround HoT launch and we face this problem too (it was even worst when 1 dead player could rally multiple ennemies). A lot rage about them and just when horrible things to happen to them, but I didn't see it the same way. Those followers (that wasn't griefer) are parts of the gamemode just like door must be take down before taking control of towers or keeps. Sure, you could get lucky with a mesmer hinding and portal your squad behind the wall but 99% of the time you must take down the doors. Trying to avoid followers are like trying to get ported for every doors. This isn't playing the gamemode but trying to avoid what you didn't like.
---
IMO the right way to deal with "followers" is anything outside of griefing them or trying to avoid them. Use them at your advantage and don't keep them at your disadvantage. They might actually be interested in playing with you and following you command. With my old static we found amusing strategie to use them like; make them a decoy when you squad hide. The ennemie zerg might get split up or even all could go because they when to kill this "easy" ranger. They might be so focus on the ranger that they will not see you. They will waste Spike CD on the ranger and/or get split up. This will give you an amazing advantage against them. You could always turn a bad situation into your advantage, you just need to be creative.
---
Don't try to make your rule "THE" rule to follow, but put yourself in a position where you take advantage of the rule.
---
No. But if you get scammed support won't help you. Trade on your own risk.
---
I really enjoy Guardian. I always go back to the class and it has been my main since launch even though I initially wanted to main warrior as I mained warrior in GW1. It's like the Monk, Paragon, and Warrior all rolled into one and it just stuck with me. Very adaptable class with viable builds in power, condi, and support.   
---
You'll always be in demand as a power DPS if you play guardian. But if you want coveted classes, I think Chronomancer is at the top of that list undoubtedly. Mesmers are in demand for every type of content in the game -- that's not to say that others aren't, but they, along with Druids and Renegades are certainly the most coveted in that order.   
---
One thing to consider though is that each class has multiple specializations, each with unique skill ceilings. Playing a class for a long time shows through in your experience regardless of the class you choose and I appreciate that about the combat system in GW2 compared to WoW where most everyone runs identical builds for their class based on the gameplay mode with very, very little variation between.
---
It's not only a risk of the other player not fulfilling their end of the bargain.  It's a risk because you can't know for sure that the other player acquired their goods through legit means.
---
If the item was stolen from another account, bought via gems to gold where the gems were fraudulently bought, then items can be stripped and your account may even get actioned as a result.
---
your job as a druid in fractals is not really healing, it is to bring some offensive boons (25 might, fury, spirits, spotter, glyph) and utility and heavy CC with your pets, the healing and defensive boons you bring (regen, prot, vigor, swiftness) are extras on top. if your usual group already gets their offensive boons from a support herald (might+fury) then running a druid on top of it might be redundant, you could run power soulbeast to bring just the spirits for example as an alternative option. usually druid support is paired with chrono to cover all offensive boons with only 2/5 party members dedicated to support and the other 3 can focus on dps.
---
Super useful, thanks for the taking all of that time to write your response. You seem to be hovering around what others have suggested with the exception of elementalist. I think you make good arguments for all 3 however and since you're also verifying that guardian is pretty top notch. I like what you said about Druids since i've already started leveling one of my own, I think that i'll keep this up.
---
Honestly mesmer just intrigues me... ive looked up some videos and it looks like a huge pain in the ass to learn but it also looks very fun once you get past the initial learning curve.
---
They dont have rules against it, but they dont support you either, if something goes wrong. You can bribe the mods there to be the middle man, which generally erases all the danger of getting scammed. Usually, stuff that isnt able to be sold via standard methods is sold there, or stuff that exceeds the value of 10k gold. You can sell other items there aswell, but you usually its not worth the trouble.
---
Lets paraphrase the conversation:
---
Arenanet: "Guild Wars 2 is 11 million strong!"
---
GodLikeKillerB: "Arenanet is lying! There's no way they have 11 million active players currently!"
---
LordKrall: "Arenanet didn't say that."
---
You: "Lol! Blind and unwavering loyalty!" 
---
You're right that if you choose to infer stuff that Arenanet didn't say, it can come out looking looking dishonest. All LordKrall did is point out that GodLikeKillerB was criticizing a claim that Arenanet never actually made except in his own head.
---
They haven't because they abandoned the game immediately after releasing POF and put it into maintenance mode.
---
I think that the difference is that a lot of that earlier stuff may have had problems but it feels like it was more a matter of design mistakes/not quite knowing what exactly to do with the game versus more recent LW stuff which feels like more of a lack of effort.
---
Shoulda bought them up well before now TBH.  The mad cash to be made was 2-3 months ago.
---
These are the standard grades of gear:
---
White  
---
Blue  
---
Green  
---
Yellow  
---
Orange (Exotic)  
---
Pink (Ascended)  
---
Purple (Legendary)
---
At level 80 you only need orange to finish everything in PvE and you can buy that in the auction house for a couple of gold if you don't want to wait for rewards/crafting/drops.  The Pink and Purple you have to earn, you can only by some trinkets.
---
So you can buy a set with the stats you want, even if it is not the look you want.  Reskin using Transmutation charges to whatever look you like, dye every piece just so, and pose in Lion's arch with the rest of us.  And no one will notice what you are wearing because everyone has their hero screen open and is tweaking their dyes from blue tint to fog to see if that is just right.
---
That is one ugly baby.
---
Daily fractals tier 3 or 4, open the chest u have keys, sell the yellow itens, save the mats and sell the trash itens from the chest to npcs, quick 6-10g in less than 1hr, as we cant farm fractal 40 endless in 5 min anymore...
---
Also, do you think this situation would motivate a player to *buy* a level 80 package for what, $40? I have a hard time believing that. All they did was play the class they wanted to play. Now they have to pay $40 to boost another one they don't want to play?
---
I'm here for you noobs! Here to help! Love seeing new players and helping you all. Overall GW2 has a great community so please feel free to ask any veterinarians for help.
---
Haha yeah me too! I thought they worked for Anet lol. I was really happy when I found out that I could tag up as well n.n

it's been 7 months since that episode released, and the only spoilery thing about the thumbnails is eir, which should be confusing at best. the bigger issue is people not thinking for a second when clicking on a video, causing them to spoil *themselves*, which frankly isn't anywhere near ANets fault and responsibility.
---
Carry around a mixed Viper/Seraph set to swap into condi Druid. Axe/Torch + Shortbow for weapons. It brings pretty much everything a healing Druid can, but trades off most of the healing for higher damage. Trait-wise, just switch to Spirited Arrival in Nature Magic and Light on your Feet in Skirmishing and you're good to go.
---
Spotter, Spirits, and Glyph are so good that even if you've already got your bases covered for boons and healing, you're still an asset.
---
&gt; even then a team can do just fine without a druid.
---
Yeah they could but that doesn't mean you're a burden. Playing when you know a druid has your back is way easier / chill
---
that doesnt change the price XD
---
Fractals - everything is viable and accepted until you get into the highest tier of difficulty(T4 and Challenge modes).  Mesmer alone or a combo of firebrand and revenant supply the most sought after boons quickness and alacrity.  Warrior has class unique buffs in banners which are very powerful.  Elementalist and Guardian are the most "meta" pure dps but anyone who is skilled on their class can do it.
---
PvP - everything is viable and accepted until you get into the highest tier of difficulty(automated tournaments).  Every class works in PvP, it's more about which playstyle suits you better than anything else.  I'd say elementalist is probably in the weakest spot right now in PvP, but still usable.
---
Raids - Mesmer, Warrior, Ranger are in basically every group for tanking/boons/utility/healing.  And again, while some are stronger than others at the absolute highest level of play, basically every class can DPS if they know how to use their class.
---
I'd say mesmer, guardian, warrior, and to a lesser extent ranger and elementalist are going to give you the most versatile/accepted class.  However, you will almost certainly make multiple characters eventually so it's kind of a moot point.  I'd advise picking something you like thematically because by the time you get to the point where you are participating in the higher echelons of this game, you can easily make another character and max them and gear them basically instantly.
---
...until you make a character taller than an Asura at least.
---
Not entirely true, FFXIV also has a mentor system, and I would argue it is better than GW2s because new players are shown it and given direct ways to contact mentors, and a mentor can add them to a new player and mentor only chat channel. There are also separate mentors for PvE, PvP, Crafting, and All, so you can find a real expert in whatever field you have a question about.
---
This reminds me of the good ol' GW2 killer stairs glitch for a few years after GW2's release.
---
[https://youtu.be/2ASH-aO1RwQ](https://youtu.be/2ASH-aO1RwQ)
---
Yeah, I get what you're saying. I think i'm gonna stick to guardian and just fuck shit up.
---
Any chance you wanna gift an Aura of Displacement to a life long sin main? :D
---
Every aspect was awful, pretty much.
---
Other than Tangled Depths, there were pretty much no events outside the metas, so if you showed up when the outposts were done there was literally nothing to do other than map completion. The events like "Kill the Veteran Mordrem" in VB were either not there or on long cooldowns. 
---
And because of the lack of events, getting experience for Masteries was an unholy grind. Also the story used to require Itzel 4 for no real mechanical reason. In the release window I had to spend 2 entire days grinding to continue the story. With no events outside the metas.
---
And then the currencies were crazy too. Chests dropped half of what they so now, there were less Chests, and events were stingy as all hell giving keys to the point where it was basically a net negative to open them if you were going on map completion. Picture Crystalline Ore, but all 4 maps were nearly that bad.
---
Even non currency rewards. For bladed armor, you *needed* to get to T4 to have a *small chance* of the chest piece dropping. Quick: How often do you see VB hit T4? Basically never, unless a guild sponsors It? It wasn't all that much better on release, because even if you had the coordination and the numbers nobody wanted to bother with low rewards.
---
For the first 6 months many players downright hated HoT because there was no meaningful rewards or progress and it was Korean MMO levels of grindy. HoT 2.0 saved that expansion, though it wasn't until recently that people began to be okay with every map being on a timer.
---
PoF is positively amazing compared to the launch state of HoT. Even with lower rewards there is actual stuff to do other than spamming adventures for exp.
