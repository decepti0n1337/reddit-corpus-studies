&gt; Sale is over. If your bf has it discounted, he probably have some of the episodes unlocked so they are deducted from the total cost thus shown as "discounted"
---

---
This is incorrect information. Living World chapters can always be purchased "in bulk" for 160gems/chapter rather than 200gems/chapter if you purchase "the season". If you've already purchased one or more chapters, then "the season" won't include those chapters and the prices will be reduced so it's still 160gems/chapter.
---
If "the season" isn't showing up for you, then they still haven't fixed the bug.
---

---
Performance.
---
"...that would grant reduced rewards compared to standard raids and no kp or LI/LD". So it would only be useful for training and as a stepping stone. Can you not read?
---
&gt; If your bf has it discounted, he probably have some of the episodes unlocked so they are deducted from the total cost thus shown as "discounted"
---
That's not how that works. The price of the [LWS3 Complete Pack] (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Living_World_Season_3_Complete_Pack) will always be 160gems/chapter for every chapter you have not previously unlocked. If you haven't unlocked any chapters, it'll cost 960gems. If you have only 2 chapters left to unlock, it'll cost 320gems.
---
It's not showing up because it's bugged.

Sandswept is just such a fun map. The gathering, the events, and the bounties. They all just fit well. Too bad Tangled Depths is only at its best during Shiny Bauble week. I'll have to test what Tangled Depths is like without Shiny Baubles.
---
Power SB all day. The high crits/stuns/mobility in this spec are super fun. I still surprise people roaming in wvw with the huge damage/mobility this class has. Glass cannon ftw, it makes you get better at evading damage! Also Axe/Axe is fun to incorporate in your build if you go the power route. I run GS/AA for most content with the occasional toot on the warhorn. Condi is great fun as well, lots of burn, bleed, poison with D/T Shortbow, played it for months in T4s and had a blast. Just got my druid geared up recently, the first few T4 runs went smoothly, nobody seemed to notice it was my first time playing druid so I guess it can't be to hard if ya got the healing power, having a great time playing support tho. Ranger is pretty versatile just a matter of how you want to play it.
---
we need more backgrounds too
---
EU lags when you play from EU ... that might be just me tho
---
Strike missions will just be easy mode raid, although some of the raids (especially Wing 1) are so darn easy and powercrept that I really don't see the point in it. What this game needs is more hard endgame group content, not even more of the easy stuff. They have been ignoring this part of the community for years and now it seems like they not only don't care about their wishes, but they actively decided to do the exact opposite of what raiders want.
---
I hope I am wrong and just a pessimist. I hope they will be great and I will enjoy them. But this really isn't what I think anybody asked for.
---
Um, why would I want mount skins when the S4 maps eventually awarded me with a Roller Beetle and Skyscale?  Functional mounts are cooler than skins my dude.  If there are going to be mount skins as rewards then I'd make them really friggin hard to get -- like CM challenges, or an insane number of currency per map, or something only the top tier PvP players could earn.  There should be prestige for earning them.
---
They should have world-boss themed skins that you get AFTER you complete 200 of each boss kill.  A plant-themed Raptor for TT, a rotting Griffon for Tequatl, etc.
---
Last update I remember was them adding and then removing culling from wvw. 
---
I pretty much quit because they stopped caring about actual content and started focusing on cosmetics.
---
Yeah this npc is a real gem, I really enjoy his company as well !
---
It's actually really unfortunate how much backlash this expansion got (imo) While playing it for the first time I can honestly say its been a long time since I was truly able to enjoy the pure beauty and ambiance of the game's world around me. Especially in Aura Basin..wow. Just Wow.  And at the time when it first came out and masteries/specializations were new it was definitely the first time I ever really got in to the game in an immersive roleplaying like way. That was fun. &amp; The living/eventful maps was definitely at the time a step up from vanilla living event maps at the time so I ended up spending lots of time doing them. 
---
It pissed me off to no end that I was literally one of the only people who liked HoT. Or at least it seemed that way. Regardless,  I'm glad someone likes it years later.
---
i first though you said craft them thats why i said no.
---
yes and no they are still kp, but they arent good since you can get them both ways, same as you can get lucky and get red celestial infusion from doing Shattered Observatory 1 time or nto get lucky and in order to get it have to pay 90 Unstable Cosmic Essence
---
Most of these leave a trail and are super cheap

---
&gt; "something exciting" could be recurring festivals, balance patches, and gem store sales
---
We ALWAYS had those though.
---
So this week it would be Cursed Shore?  Got it.
---
Let's say you are right with this one and let's say Knight of the Thorns, cooking 500 and Ad Infinitum are also "traditional quests" (they aren't but are similar). 
---
Okay, we have *Four* "traditional quests now. *Four" out of thousands of non traditional achievements, hundred of hearts and thousands, if not tenthousands of events.
---
Even if you find 10 or 20 "traditional quests", they are still a big exception. While it's technically right to say "GW2 have *a few* quests similar to traditional quests", it's *wrong* to say that the game have a traditional quest system.
---
You can also verify this using the API to make sure you have everything that's been white listed.
---
Indeed! But that doesn't mean they're not part of "something exciting" — that's about one's perspective. If you're being optimistic, then you might be expecting something else on top of the "usual" events. If you're being pessimistic, you'll expect nothing on top of them.. and maybe some schedule slippage on top of that. I'm just trying to stay pragmatic and assume they will work how they've recently worked, and beyond that wait and see.
---

---
Bosses like TT usually organize well before the timer comes up; at least 15 minutes or so before.  Might be better to look on the LFG around then.
---
Oh that whole episode hit me from the side with a rocket-powered baseball bat. But I accepted it because I don't write the story and hope there's a concise, overall point.
---
I'd prefer a way to save graphic profiles. I also set stuff to max, but need to tone it down during metas and world bosses
---
That's fine -- I'm personally quite excited for new content to play and explore. New enemies and raids can make you adapt your playstyle as well; I'm reminded of how dramatically I had to change my build the first time I went into the Heart of Thorns areas, and the excitement of learning to adapt to new challenges. Though I'm looking forward to getting more at some point, this prologue never had to have new elite specs in order to be exciting to me.
---
You're literally in a thread about an article *about the future of the game*, aren't you?
---
There is actually 4 glider skins ingame, 3 of them are legendary one is not
---
WP recently made a video about Season 1 &gt;  https://youtu.be/-j1yFvQFs8Y
---
To be honest I would love to waste my time just trying to get those mounts in-game then just not play for months log in and "oh look new mount skins let me check how much gold or money I have to get it". (which is the case to allot of my friends that don't play the game). One would say that the end game in gw2 is the gem-store. Gotta get the new things coming got to farm gold bois!! ...is just not fun. My only wishes was for them to change how they do things with cash shop, especially with mounts to involve it more to the game content, since PoF mount license came out.
---
Like at this point I think since they released so many mounts already the drop would be the actual license to drop in certain maps of PoF within different mobs/bounties/bosses. But what am I kidding I doubt it would happen.
---
Keep farming gold guys.....Tuesday is coming got to keep up with the stuff on the gem store. u.u
---
I really don't think they appreciate how powerful elite specs are for player engagement and satisfaction.
---
Far more than story and, cautiously, I'd suggest even things like new raids, fractals, etc., new elite specs spark interest and get current and former players excited and interested. 
---
Adding a new elite spec is like, for a brief period of a few weeks or a couple of months, adding all of the content you already have in the game again for the first time. People who have done a fractal or raid 100 times will get excited to do it again with the new spec. 
---
In other words, elite specs are content multipliers. They're enthusiasm multipliers. They're interest multipliers. They're the kinds of things that make people who haven't touched their Mesmer or Ranger for months get excited to try them again and decide they need a new look so they buy some outfits from the gem store. They're the kind of thing that make people decide they need a new set of gear so they trade some cash for gems.
---
They are by *far* the thing that would yield the most results for the least amount of work. I could be wrong, but I think if they introduced a new set of elites they could put the next actual content update off by months and generate more engagement than if they released the next episode.
---
They literally said "new fractals and raids are being developed." I swear to god, this community is just intractable sometimes.
---
Neither of the above.  Sorry, I thought being a doctor you might have an additional level of expertise on this subject.
---
To further your own experience and education, I recommend the book "Final Exit" and if you've read it, to reread it.  There are many different cases and just like most things, general stereotypes have many a failure.  
---
That book and others like it also help you make far more educated decisions on how to leave life in a thoughtful and informed way.  For example, to consider those who might find you and in what state and the impact on them.  To also consider general grief you can cause family and friends and much more. 
---
Additionally, there are financial matters and much more to attend to.  Many suicides do not take this into account, this is true.  Sometimes the pain is so intense, you'll take whatever means to escape it without any thinking.  There are also cases like the above and cases everywhere in between.
---
I think also, you'd find that the number of suicides would dramatically increase if pain-free, guaranteed, easily accessible methods were introduced.  I don't advocate that, at least without proper counseling before you take advantage of such services and other considerations like immediate grief and turmoil and age and more.

Na anet hates ranger class so they made longbow skins super dull. The leg. longbow Kudzu or whatever looks so bad.

Wow! I just installed this any loaded into Lily of Elon and went from what used to be 8fps to 21fps. Huge boost in performance so far. Thank you so much!
---
Guild wars uses a Megaserver system so it shouldn't matter that you're on different servers, unless you somehow picked an NA server and he picked an EU one. 
---
Also all the starting zone waypoints should be unlocked so you can teleport to your friend if you picked different races. 
---
Does that help?

The deleting your characters thing doesn’t work on free to play accounts. The tradeoff for this is that f2p accounts get a free transfer when they upgrade to a paid account.
---
Core game, from most to least populated:
---
SW (Silverwastes) is good for profit and building skills.
---
Dry Top is good for its unique weapon skins and achievements.
---
The three Orrian maps are okay for their meta events but the full metas aren't run every day consistently.
---
Frostgorge Sound has one popular boss but the rest of the map seems to be forgotten. Not bad, just forgettable.
---
Southsun Cove is fantasy australia. The enemies are a bit frustrating and something feels missing to me with the current events. A good chunk of the issue I think is from what I've heard the map was originally used for a lot of temporary story events and bosses that no longer exist due to the scrapping of Living Story Season 1. There's one boss still in existence that is needed for a big achievement, and not a lot of players play the map otherwise.
---
And, I think that's it, for F2P-available maps. Edit: I don't actually know if you're F2P, but figured core game was the best place to start for a fresh 80.
---
I was happy when I saw this guy. Would love a mini of him!!
---
Nope, just you...in the whole world-wide internet.
---
I agree, I'm not even against KP. I just think that the proper channels need to exist to obtain KP. I'm perfectly fine with stratified groups based on player progression; after all, this is exactly what exists in WoW and FFXIV. You get started on a heroic/normal raid group to cut your teeth, work your way through some good parses, join a lower end mythic/savage raiding guild, and keep working your way up as you amass good parses for applying to a top raiding guild in your server. It is totally fine for people to self-segregate according to goals and skill levels.
---
I just don't think GW2 has that. It's a completely polarized experience with a rather poor system for giving gradients to player ability and the ability to group them up so they can progress accordingly.
---
As regards the downvotes, I'm used to it with reddit. It's not a GW2 only thing, it happens in FFXIV too. People are cretins and often you can get downvoted simply because some people disagree. The purpose of a downvote was to determine the quality of a post, but it's been abused and I wouldn't be sad to see it removed and just leave upvotes so more productive posts can still rise to the top.
---
You'll get a couple per character for free, and then you'll have to pay, probably 400 gems for more per character
---
I don't know why people keep asking for things that are easily monetized, and then acting shocked when they monetized it.
---
Yeah, imagine all the stories and quests they could do to introduce various mounts. yes, it's a huge missed opportunity and a waste of some awesome potential, but that's reality of the gemstore. It's an incredible cashcow for the devs and it's a big way in which they monetize the game, presumably.
---
Nah, downvotes are just as useful I think xD
---
Our problem with self segregation is that, let's be honest, you dont see good players below 100kp. Good players below 100kp are running with their friends in 250kp teams. Under 100 people struggle with their rotations. Which is the main issue with all endgame content, people just dont know how to deal enough dmg

Welp, case closed. That one item has disproved the possibility of the existence of TP bots.

No I expect one.

You’re a machine! I’m super hyped to watch them all and try your builds.
---
Can I just point out something fractals have come when Anet said they will. Anet said fractals come every second episode. This has happened. With a star to guide us long live the lich we got sirens reef I believe, then 2 episodes later we got deepstone in All or Nothing.
---
The HoT and PoF content is more important to progress as a level 80 player, but you should definitely continue enjoying the core game.
---
I would think unique armor/weapon skins similar to TT would work.
---
That fashion disaster next to Ronald? I agree.
---
Maybe, maybe not. It \*is\* just a prologue after all. But it would be kind of weird not to have one. If not tomorrow, maybe Wednesday.

I'm all for in-game earn-able mount skins and glider skins and other stuff, it doesn't help my case much when trying to get my friends to play GW2 with me and I have tell them that sadly too much of the nicer cosmetic items are exclusive to the gem store.

Are dragonite ore and bloodstone dust worth keeping? They just keep clogging up my inventory. From what I read they’re used in crafting ascended stuff, but since I won’t be doing that soon, maybe I could just refarm they when needed?

This is legitimately interesting, thanks for sharing with us! I'm someone who just likes to decide on a whim what I want to do in-game, so maybe I'll take into account some of this data when deciding if I want to increase my gold income just by a tiny bit, it's never a huge priority for me, but gold is always nice. Thanks again, hope you continue to expand on this project, or will work on something similar in future, always enjoy seeing new data like this!
---
I liked the outpost system, but the community hated it. You can understand why they went back to open exploration style maps.
---
since you expecting a trailer or not will have absolutely no influence on a new trailer being shown or not, what is the purpose of expecting one at all?
---
Positives about this article:
---
* New maps sound like they will be huge if they will work on them after release, they might even reach longevity of HoT maps
---
* Yes, we need more challenging world bosses and content. I believe harder dungeons would be better idea than Strike Missions.
---
* Raids and fractals are still going to be coming
---
Negatives:
---
* Nothing really hype, just moving to old stuff that worked better than new stuff
---
* The pace of the story seems like it will be slow and people will be spending money/farm on gems to kill their boredom
---
* Seems they count Christmas and Halloween events that are the same every year content? Or are they planning something new?
---
* Didn't mention if we will get expansion after this Living world Season
---
* Is GW2 on maintenance mode? They just release easy to make already-seen content on slow pace but different format?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What they should do:
---
*  Make it clear when we are getting elite specs
---
*  Have a team reworking old and adding new dungeons
---
* SPEED UP THE DEVELOPMENT!!! Who cares if they make a few mistakes on a map/dungeon/fractal. Just make lot of it and people at Anet will learn how to work faster without making mistakes. Having a clear voice on who is leading the group and has the vision regarding outcome while taking responsiblity regarding which idea is worth going for, will speed up the content a lot. Also WvW alliances....  Anet had the idea for what, 4 years now? That is when I heard about it from some insider who had been at some gaming event or something and it is still isn't done? Is that acceptable speed of development? Imagine the poor guys who have been working it for years on something they have no passion towards without finishing it, they must hate their job.

I finally went after all the achievements to get all the mastery points within the last six months and had zero trouble getting in on organized maps with successful kills.  This was in NA.
---
&gt;paid expansions aren't impossible in the future
---
What strikes me off about this statement on expansions is as if we never had em before. Like, we had LS followed by expansions, then they gave up on it. Now they're acting as if that's a "concept" they need to explore, what?
---
Ahaahah, this is fantastic! Thanks XD Did i read right this are phone drawings? Thats super impressive. Stylus or finger? App?
---
I think when they said region, they might have meant NA vs EU based on context, but I'm not 100% certain
---
For anyone opening this thread as confused as I am, this is the Chinese guy who pops up every few months to complain about GW2 instead of quitting.

Sad.

Thanks! It's called Tayasui Sketches. I got it when it was on sale one day and it's by far the best phone sketching app I've encountered.

What? Tons of people wanted easy mode raids, even raiders. Myself included. The problem with raids is that only a tiny percentage of the players actually do them, and according to ANet the main reason is because they're "too hard." (Filthy casuals) 
---
Everyone should be looking forward to strike missions. 
---
Apparently they're going to re-use story bosses, fucking finally.
---
They're a "casual" 10 man instance so as to acclimate people to the idea of raiding.
---
PLUS you can basically do a hot join OR go in as a premade group.
---
Holy shit, we've been screaming about this stuff for years. I don't get why people aren't more excited for it.
---
to be fair to wow, you can pay for the monthly sub with in game gold pretty easily. i and pretty much everyone i play with hasnt paid real money for our subs since the token was put in the game.
---
The vast majority of current players beg to differ.
---
Yeah it's veteran players feel left out and rightly so.
---
But that doesn't mean your opinion and yours alone speaks for the rest of the community.
---
Nice, man. Do you play?
---
Very well put. I hope ANet sees this comment, they really need to understand this.
---
Going into PoF they had the perfect cadence A paid expansion every two years with new Elite specs, new Masteries, a few new maps providing the precursor to future maps being introduced in subsequent Living Story updates, and at least one cool new big feature like Gliding or Mounts. Ideally also a new PvP map, new Fractal and the beginning of a new Raid, where future wings can be rolled out in future Living Story updates. WvW is more about not fucking it up than adding new things (the desert map being case in point).
---
Just keep doing that every 2yrs and they’re golden. That gooses their revenue in big way every 2 years, provides a major marketing opportunity for the game every 2yrs, refreshes the old content as you explain and adds new content. Have 3 or 4 Living World updates in between expansions, and they’re good to go.
---
JX3 doesn't exist outside of China, Korea and Japan. If 300k players generate it 3.5x the income of GW2, it's monetization must intolerably aggressive. No thanks.
---
These are better than I can ever do. Love them!
---
Slow down, men working!
---
NA literally always sucks. I say that as someone who lives in America too and chooses to play on EU.

---
Was not aware of that post... had some irl issues and just logged in and didn't bother checking &gt;&lt;  my bad.
---
Another reason Raid builds work in open world is that any hard open world content is usually being done by a group, most of whom are using Raid builds.
---
fyi: there is a grp/guild/community aka discord out there that is doing a training group. 
---
Dont expect anything about raid from normal pugs on LFG.
---
Sounds fun. Lol. I wish this game cared about the veterans just a little bit more. I left the game maybe in 2015. Then a year or so later they added raids so I tried to come back. What I noticed is that I was already fully geared and there was no real reason to come back. The story got very stale the map rewards were all tied to some bs everyone participate in this thing and all rewards were outfits I gave no fuck about. And to even extend my playtime I got eternity. After that I was officially done. 
---
Sad thing is that the game is beautiful and the mechanics are so fucking good. It bothers me so much because I truly love this game. It's why I'm still lurking on this sub. 4 years later and I'm still waiting for legendary gear and some actually difficult content that rewards the player with more than another skin.

---
Glad you enjoy them! You can do it too, it just takes a bit of practice. And a lot of squinting.

I see what you did there, JX3 marketer.
---
PS - GW2 updated more than “two pieces of informations”.
---
I can't help but wonder what kind of mental process can lead anyone to think that the bad practices of a Korean grinder style Chinese MMO should be applied to a game that has been essentially designed to be their antithesis.
---
Before the August 30th conference, I have not logged in to GW2 for 4 months. I only play 2 hours of GW2 in a week because it is too boring.
---
I continue simply because you do. Again, saying "most people" all the time is fake news. Stop with the flimsy argument.
---
It’s kind of amusing to me that WoW was able to restore *all* of WoW Classic after 15yrs, but ANet seems to have lost the assets of LW Season 1 after 7 years. WTF engineering devops team, y u not source control.
---
Dude, you think too much, my girlfriend told me that GW2 is the most boring game she has ever played.
---
it's not fake news, nor is it flimsy argumentation. you cannot accept that you are wrong.
---
I'm actually surprised that someone so boring and pathetic actually got girlfriend. Still. Start a family so we don't have to read your stupid posts every month.
---
Please also stop logging into GW2 subbreddits.

It sounds like he has a free to play account and I am not sure it is possible to do that with F2P.

Perhaps your stupidity is reflected in the inability to compare business models through similar games, and to take advantage of the advantages of other companies for their own use. This is probably why my company can make a good return.
---
Maybe not always.

I got one as a drop from the daily pirate chest in LA.

I wanted to pick up Path of Fire from Dlgamer, but I was confused on what content I'd be picking up from Heart of Thorns from their store page. 
---
Does this come with Heart of Thorns like the official store does?
---
True. There is no introduction to proper play, and then there's only one 0-1 community check, with no intermediate steps.
---
But hey, we need to be a positive community I guess.
---
&gt; but now my only path forward would be to create an entirely new email just for a new account
---
Creating a new email account is super easy.  I have three email accounts for my GW2 accounts.
---
&gt;	came back a little while before PoF and played all the HoT content.
---
&gt;	I felt the difficulty was right in point.
---
Ah but see if you went in there just before PoF you missed out on how deadly it was on release.
---
Rough estimate is that the difficulty when you played it was about the midpoint between core Tyria and where HoT was initially.
---
That said, I agree that I think it's about right as it is now...but on release I found it unenjoyable, as I had to, at my skill level, basically play by sneaking around and never engaging any mobs.
---
I wonder how the gph would do with bounty glyph for hitting mussel nodes.  As I've noticed that map has a lot of those.  Not to mention high drop rate for coral orbs.

I sense nerfs and cries. Who else senses nerfs and cries?

I think you should look up dying in the dictionary. I don't think it means what you think it means.

Hell I know some people that live in NA that have higher ping than that.  As long as there isn't any skill delay it wouldn't be that big of a deal tbh..
---
Nothing for the bow, though :(

They've used the GW1 icons as placeholders and as monster-only skill icons. So uh, that point is moot. 
---
If they truly had especs coming soon-ish they would have acknowledged that already, since there been a lot of salt about them not coming with s5.
---
The thing I loved so much about it was that when I first entered I was completely bewildered.   It is one of the things I feel I really got to master, but only after a lot of time.   There really are lots of great shortcuts.   And the zone is enormous.
---
wow how do you make your sheets look so clean ? Mines are always messy, i am trying to make them not to be.
---
Thank you! Forgot about those! Not a fan of their skins that much though...guess I can’t be too picky
---
You never heard about MeinMMO? We are German, yes, but 10 Times bigger than massivly:  https://www.similarweb.com/website/mein-mmo.de?competitors=massivelyop.com
---
And we got theese anderes because i asked the right Questions ;)
---
&gt; firebrand
---
Is totally condi though?
---
Not rly a best role in this game. Always changes with patches kinda. War is used everywhere kinda, mesmer also fits most places.  Nec is also good, but less used in raids but mandatory in wvw for example. So w/e you play can be used for most stuff kinda. Later on you Will have Atleast 3-4 Chara geared to switch between
---
The financial report will not lie.
---
[Ayy?](https://imgur.com/a/gCoSfTE)
---
I think about this every time I'm in Bitterfrost. What makes that map still continuously populated?
---
- easy to accumulate currency 
---
- currency that has multiple uses (500 berries for gear, or consume the berries for unbound magic, for example)
---
- easy champ meta that will probably spawn while you're getting your berries = practically effortless loot
---
- probably more things I'm forgetting.
---
It just seems like this map in particular, compared to Ember Bay or whatever it's called (with the petrified wood) has a magic combination of the things I listed that other LW maps dont have.
---
Anet: We bring exciting stuff every month, fasten up the content releases and raids/fractals are still a thing.
---
CrimsonVII: MaInTeNaNcE mOdE!!!1!!
---
Festivals are just temporary content available only for a limited period of time each year, sucking away people from all other content and reducing gameplay variety while not being fun to play themselves.
---
You know that's why yearly events are all about and why they are so popular? And actually they do bring new stuff every year. ;)
---
Not a ranger main, but I love to troll people with it:
---
\- Take a pig follower
---
\- Give it the same name as someone, you want to troll.
---
\- enjoy the show! :D
---
nah, i live in China, skill delay is noticeable. it really bugs me
---
Yeah , the warclaw box of skins , and the skyscale box of skins are truly lazy. Colowswaps are exactly what they are. I had to look at 2 of the warclaw skins for 10 minutes to see a difference. And the difference was a small accent on the saddle .
---
Usually its people you play with normally or you do instanced content with like raids n fractals.
---
Like the last four times they said raid release rate would go up from W4 onwards while the releases only took longer and longer?
---
The prices aren't an accident. They do research , and there are even companies that advise on this. They choose price points that will make the most profit per sale .
---
How in the world it is "expensive AF"?
---
Interesting, I get that anet might be testing some stuff for the new living world season, but that is kinda hilarious. Thanks for the answer!
---
&gt; That was pretty uninspiring and weak if the difficulty level is anywhere near that low
---
I mean he said the entrace and group up system is the same. About the difficulty he only said it's possible to do them with less than 10 ppl with a good group. And well, many raid bosses are easily doable with less than 10 ppl in a good group.
---
Shhh.
---
It doesn't matter that raiders get one wing a year, thats still a healthy release schedule right?
---
Sigh, well you are a person who is not going to be raiding in this game unfortunately. 
---
&gt;Lest I remind you, NO OTHER GAME has this asinine 'training guild' bottleneck
---
I agree, but also understand the reasons behind this. The games average skill level is extremely low and in part this has effected the general culture of the game and made it so a lot of people like yourself don't want to do what I have outlined above which would be the alternative and there are also not a lot of people creating new progression raid guilds which would be the other alternative (for the same reason)
---
I will also remind you that in no other game will you get experienced players activily pug none experienced players in raids. That's just a fact of these systems. 
---
Also the main reason the raid scene is dying is because you can't release 3 "bosses" every 7-8 months and think you can retain those players. 
---
GL to you my dude but I doubt you will ever raid in GW2 at this rate.
---
Master the combat system it’s easily one of the most fun things about the game and mess around with your keybindings so it’s comfortable when using them. 
---
Do events and hearts. Roam around and explore. Just have fun you’ll progress if you keep going
---
Hello, welcome to the game! Hope you enjoy it. :3
---
What do you mean by get forward? If you have hit Level 80, here a few way to move forward to:
---
1. Get expansion, currently you can buy Path of Fire(2nd expansion) and get free Heart of Thorns(1st expansion), and continue on the story &amp; exploration.
---
2. If you already got expansion, you can try to do Raids and/or Fractals(if you are into PvE) as well as PvP &amp; WvW.
---
3. If you are free player, you do other things like Dungeon or farm gold to get Ascended gears. Otherwise you can wait for Holiday events like Halloween(Shadow of the Mad King, coming soon) etc.
---
You can DM/PM me your ign too if you're looking for friends! See you in game o/
---
&gt; Hell, Kasmeer and Marjory were supposed to be tracking Kralkatorrik and yet they never popped up again.
---
Because they were helping to evacuate villagers and safe them from kralk.
---
&gt; either kill off the rest or have them do their own thing.
---
They *did* their own thing...
---
Also killing a character because you don't "need" them for now is like the worst way to handle characters. 
---
Just don't look at it like you watch a movie, look at it the way your char see it. In a movie, you are an observer, you see everything, the good guy, the bad guy and the secret detail the good guy must not know. But as the player, you only know what you experience. You do your stuff, but other characters to their stuff as well. They don't stuck and wait until you interact with them or "need" them. And they don't need to tell you everything they do.
---
Eh, I loved it.
---
Yeah it's not 100% sure, but it seems the marks are now missing and people have some of those trophies instead - but I guess we'll find out eventually. \^\^
---
Rifle or pistol for guardian! With holy bullets, turning each shot into plasma or blue fireballs.
---
Everything the devs put into the game for you to do is by definition content, mate.
---
If you get the expansion just DON’T USE the level 80 boost till you leveled your first character!
---
I have exactly 0 expectations for this game now. I’m just gonna play my toon until I get bored.
---
Wishful thinking indeed.
---
Even bigger wishful thinking? "They will try to do releases faster rather than 3\~4 months."
---
How many times have we heard that already?
---
War Eternal came out May 14th. It's almost 4 months to the day. And we're just getting a presumably smaller prologue episode with no mention of when Episode 1 will actually be out.
---
Look at the release schedule: All or Nothing in January 8, War Eternal in May 14, Bound by Blood in September 17. This is abysmal. It might not be sunset-level support, but it sure as hell ain't flagship-level of production efficiency either.
---
In Gummy Bear Guild Race mission, guild banners used to show others the safe way.
---
But, but...SAB IS exciting. Don't you mess with SAB man!
---
Only after Fire Elemental and someone must open the portal with [Matrix Cube Key](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Matrix_Cube_Key)
---
According to wiki:
---
" The Matrix Cube Key isn't instanced and it appears in the same place for all players - one player picking it up will cause it to disappear for all players "
---
Probably someone picked it up and the key respawned on the place you checked already.
---
&gt;Because they were helping to evacuate villagers and safe them from kralk.
---
Ah yes, they did that for the entire damn season. How silly of me.
---
&gt; They *did* their own thing 
---
No they didn't, they vanished from the narrative while still being a part of Dragon's Watch and did nothing because the writing didn't need them.
---
People REALLY need to stop excusing bad writing.
---
&gt; does it only pop up after the fire elemental has been defeated
---
The key to open it requires the fire elemental boss to charge but the timings are otherwise independent. It has a cooldown that is around 20 minutes
---
It can also be reached using a rift stabilizer instead of the key.
---
Server doesn't matter outside WvW. It's a megaserver and you can see players from different servers on your map.
---
I know EU players can't play together with NA players.
---
If you don't see your friend on the same map, he's probably in other instance. Just make a party, right-click on his name and "Join in \[map name\]".
---
It doesn't matter if your friend play as other race. First waypoints in 1 lvl maps (Queensdale, Plains of Ashford, Caledon Forest, Metrica Province, Wayfarer Foothills) are unlocked for everyone. Free accounts can't enter the city under 10 lvl.
---
I mainly just need to have the barrier down to collect the light for the Sunrise 3 collection
---
No-one?
---
Really?

Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.

---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)

---
Awesome, you put me and my drawing tablet to shame with your fun sketches. Thanks for the art and laughs, you made my day.
---
People tend to get bored of skins after a while. I'm sure a lot of people transmute gemstore skins onto legendaries as well after a while.
---
The mind of a shill is truly fascinating
---
The extra stat you will get are 70 condition  damage because Carrion does not grand you any Toughness you are only converting from the base 1k and 0 Expertise because you will probably have no Concentration to convert.
---
To give you some perspective 70 Condition Damage is slightly more than what 2 Might stacks would give you. So while not nothing, I think Chaotic Transference will not bring you much damage. I would say try to see when each apply and try to swap: if you know you will not get regularly (or a lot) of damaging conditions on you then take the extra stats, otherwise you could probably pick Auspicious Anguish.
---
In Open World: Low character model limit and I see a lot of characters.
---
In W4 Deimos: Low character model limit and I can't see anyone.
---
Why?
---
Huh, didn't even think about that. But I'd rather not get any expectations high...
---
Assuming you’re not doing any hardcore content based on carrion gear, it doesn’t matter. Open world and stuff isn’t about maximizing dps and all that, it’s enjoying the game. Experiment around; you can literally change back anytime. It’s part of the fun, and you’ll make the build perfect for you. That perfect build could be super meta, or something you create.
---
&gt; Firebrand+Renegade (with one of them possibly healer)
---
The fractal META has no healer. Low kp PUGs of course do use a healer and that's understandable, but the most effective combination is: hybrid alacrigade, power quickbrand, bs, and for dps soulbeast, weaver or dragonhunter.
---
I have a mixed opinion on this. I think every map should be that way but this will bring a few problems with it.
---
I think it is pretty impossible to make every map feel the same in terms of rewards because there are too many variables that have an impact on this. Layout, placement of nodes, Enemies and so on. And even if you get as close as possible then players will find the most lucrative and efficient way possible and the focus will be on that regardless.
---
And if you, by some miracle, made them equally rewarding then you will also split the players to those different maps which will make every map a low population but not really any higher.
---
So, I don't know. It seems like that those living world maps are only really populated when you can farm them for currencies that you then can turn into gold or you get a lot of loot out of it. Lake Dorric with Leather farm and Palawadan are some examples.
---
I just hope they won't go full season 2 on us and have us listen Mar &amp; Kas bang on and on about their relationship when we just want to finish the damn story instance. 
---
Frankly I'd like some new characters already. Kinda bored with the line-up of secondary heroes we met with the first living world. Some of them are good, some dull, but I'd just like some fresh faces. 
---
And if you didn't see Redshirt Belinda is gonna die immediately, you need to read more about TV tropes. The moment she was introduced you might as well had a a guy waving a death flag behind her with bells chiming.
---
So, the alacrigade/qbrand META stays as it is?
---
&gt;" There is a custom shader that removes bloom [https://pastebin.com/UtvHPBmY](https://pastebin.com/UtvHPBmY) put that file into d912pxy/shaders/hlsl/custom with .hlsl extension, and then remove d912pxy/pck/shader\_cso.pck "
---
Damn...u/megai2 you da genius!
---
&gt; And independent of those festivals, real updates.
---
They can't really do that. A lot of players would then like to do both, creating a time-conflict. Why should they double-deliver "things2do"? It is a lot better to spread out special events, even if that means that sometimes an event is active that might not be interesting to some (anymore). It is already now hard to catch up with stuff if you don't play hours per day.
---
Just replayed season 2 on an alt account, Trahearne was such a dick just blindly bombarding the jungle. He could have killed that guy.
---
Can you [provide a source](https://i.imgur.com/BxHiWz7.png)?
---
&gt; do people still kill triple worm?
---
Yes. Maybe not every time, but the main thing you have to remember is to be there early enough to get into the organized maps.
---
And I never said it's okay. Was just making a comment on how I would think about it.
---
Would be nice, but I would still choose build templates over it.
---
If doing something for a reward is as you say one of the main motivations in MMOs, how is it a weak argument to do stuff for rewards? Especially for MMO players. Things don't have to be fun, they just need to be rewarding. If they aren't fun though, they ruin the rest of the game for those who actually like non-brainless content. It's not hard to understand. If you find festivals exciting content, you probably like the type of content where you just mindlessly grind and thats fine. For those who don't like that, festivals are a horrible period of time, especially when they're intertwined with mindless grindy bonus events.
---
...on a lute.
---
Using it for a month or so, no crash or other problems. Character portraits look funny in the character selection screen, but that's it. Even this is fixable it seems, but it does not bother me enough. 
---
&gt;**-How I can fix that wierd pop ins and character portraits?**  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Only by enabling PSO precompile, but be warned - it will raise RAM and VRAM usage by big amounts!
---
[removed]
---
Keep in mind it has no text label and a smaller model than the chaotic material you can destroy for the heart. Also the list of spawn points wasn't confirmed to be complete at least years ago when I last needed it.
---
That said your best bet is to show up reasonably early for the Fire Elemental word boss, not because it affects spawning but because someone *else* might have brought in a key to charge off the boss which will let everyone in.
---
You might also try flying straight to the platform from a nearby peak or Goemm's Lab JP but I have no idea where the exclusion zones and invisible walls end.
---
&gt;4 years later and I'm still waiting for legendary gear 
---
Damn man, that was already released a good while ago. xD
---
That's what I said. ;)
---
NA really seems much more casual in comparison to EU. All of the harder content seems much less populated, while on EU the same content has a constant influx of new players.
---
Hello New,
---
I'm Trixx.
---
If you can actually progress towards them maybe. If not and they're just pure RNG account bound drops, then people will eventually give up just like with TT.
---
Rox and Braham were in every season 2 episode your thinking of season 3.
---
Frog is really stoned
---
i comprehended the meaninglessness of OP just fine.
---
Why are you so triggered by stupid responses to meaningless posts?
---
They coded some of the skill effects and aoe markers as characters or something like that. In the past you could get the opposite and see characters but no aoes or mechanics.
---
New elite specs are effectively a new way to play the game, giving a new light to every content.
---
New content, is fun, but you don't have new tools to deal with it, it still feel old in a certain way.
---
On deimos, iirc the hands also take up character model slots
---
Good news, you was not running it at all.
---
I'd never thought about elite specs like this before. I gess it's like the experience of playing the game for the first time again, where you're unlocking new skills you have literally never used before and you're learning all the time.
---
I don't see a problem here, except maybe your cultural bias against pink as a color :D
---
Just how wow dried up after 15 years... Oh wait.
---
Which might as well include "never". Fractal leaderboards were developed for years.
---
All the daaaaamn time ಠ_ಠ . Love it!
---
I cannot ever imagine myself being \*actually\* suicidal......but if I was, I think my family / remaining friends would be the last people I'd want to reveal that level of 'darkness' to.  They all think I am a successful person (more or less)....someone they can rely on in times of hardship.
---
No, they are the last people I would trust with my true feelings.
---
It is explained in the 6 other threads with the same topic opend in the last 24h
---
Depending on what you mean by “regions” we’ll see how silly you’re being.
---
Playing with a F2P account has its limitations which also means no server transfers
---
Buying the game has its perks and that includes server transfers for a price (ddithere’s also region changing
---
That is because prologue isn't a full size LS (iBS, w/e) release. They desperately need to push out something at least for casual playerbase RIGHT NOW, so that is why it exists. When it will come to real content patches, don't expect then every 2 months.
---
Happened to me once that the door refused to open ... even with the key charged with four elements. Talk about rage :/
---
Mist capacitor to reset stats on my accessories

I'm playing on mac with the lowest resolution possible, this makes me wanna invest in a real computer TT
---
When I go to Orr, I go there to kill hundreds of mobs at overstacked temple events, or on Arah. So many T5/T6 materials and it is actually fun to do.
---
&gt; And if you didn't see Redshirt Belinda is gonna die immediately, you need to read more about TV tropes. The moment she was introduced you might as well had a a guy waving a death flag behind her with bells chiming.
---
See that's what threw me off completely, I was **ASTONISHED** to see her back alive after *first* meeting her only to see her stuffed in the fridge (nodachi?) in a meaningless repeat of the same "oh noez teh vinez" plot anyway.
---
By contrast with Blish they set up the stakes but it wasn't entirely clear whether *he* would actually be the one to die, maybe Gorrik would sacrifice himself or something.
---
yeah...give me a roller beetle skin for my thousands of [Racing Medallion](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Racing_Medallion)
---
She was basically a sheath for gemstore weaboo sword. (hiccup!)
---
Miniboss has 20 minutes cooldown and usually people go there with mounts and jsut kill it pre-worldboss and then it is gone.
---
I've got a 2080TI/2700x combo, the difference is honestly night and day especially when tweaking the custom config options. Before I used this mod in Lions Arch I would get 20-30fps at best with low-medium player count now I can get 45-60fps with same settings. The upload/vstream limit increase option helps quite a bit in large scale situations, the camera stutter that has been present in the base DX9 game is 90%+ eliminated for me. Meta event fps is also very much improved.
---
I believe DX9 being a 17 year old API is simply too old and outdated to support current hardware tech properly. (Not an expert)
---
There are some minor graphical glitches I've encountered but the performance gains outweigh all of that for me.
---
I'm aware. But the fact that people are willing to take a raw deal does not mean it isn't a raw deal. It just means that it's been successfully normalized.
---
&gt;FFXIV. The game literally runs because it forces experienced players to help inexperienced players, so I have no idea what you're smoking
---
Never played it so can't really comment, but I doubt you'll get experienced players bring in new raiders into the higher difficulties. 
---
&gt;WoW. Their raid schedule is just as bad if not worse than GW2's and yet the population is still arguably higher
---
WoW actually releases a full 8-10 boss raids not encounters which they put off as being a boss. The difficulty in WoW is much much higher and so means that that content usually lasts guilds anywhere between 2-3 months, not the single day that it takes most people to clear a GW2 raid. Also WoW raids release at a pace of around 4-5 months not 7-8 and comes with multiple difficulties. If you are looking to raid WoW and FF14 are the clear superior games.
---
And the same practices work in WoW as in GW2. Experienced players look for other experienced players to join their groups. The only difference is that there are enough people playing WoW at the various levels that it's easier to get into a group of inexperienced players. GW2 doesn't have that luxury anymore and it seems like there aren't enough inexperienced players willing to try and lead a group such as yourself. If there were more inexperienced people willing to put up groups/start progression raids this wouldn't be an issue.
---
If you do the daily fractals, that’s usually already 50g right there, not even counting the fractal chests w/ encrypted keys, which should be a plenty. If you do maybe 5 more francs, which shouldn’t take you that long, you should have the rest in sellable loot.
---
I still think they should let us earn some gem store mount skins from events. Imagine if you could earn &gt;1&lt; of the Halloween themed mount skins every year? Repeat this process with every and it would go a long way to giving players great rewards.
---
I think core necros are strong at the moment. And core mesmers still can one-shot someone. Same goes for core guard. Core thief is also playable. And in one of my last games an enemy core engi won 1v2 at our close all game long. But he had the title Champion Brawler.
---
So new agers are dragon minions. Got it.
---
What exactly do you dont understand?
---
50G in daily fractals? I'm only doing tier 3 dailies, but I usually get 4-5 gold at best, and I'm being generous.
---
We trully do live in a society
---
you better at Fashion Wars than me any day xD
---
What do you do with them? Sell on TP? My magic find is kinda low (+90%?) and I need to salvage yellow and up for globs of ecto. I'm in the process of crafting ascended gear.
---
If you give the skins free, no one will buy the ones from gemstore which is this game's "sub". Blizzard has the option to give the skins "free" cause they bill you monthly and the skins are a long grind, so you pay for them anyway. I can with 99% certainty go as far as there will never be free skins in GW2 for mounts.
---
Nope, and we didn't know the other 4 times this topic was brought up over the last 24 hours either
---
I open the yellows, if they’re worth something then I sell them, if not then I break them down. I sell stacks of greens and blues, any exotics are usually sell, you should also be getting junk items worth 1-5g a piece, just tons of them while doing fractals, so make sure you sell junk too.
---
I mean that’s sort of how GW2 is designed and why it stands out so much, every other MMO is afking in the cities waiting for queues, pugs or guild runs through instances content.
---
I thought the legendary system was amazing to incentivize playing all types of content and to make sure everything you do amounts to something. FFXIV has a similar system, WoW used to in Legion.
---
If you prefer instanced content then WoW is superior hands down and ANet will never be able to compete with that, which is why they’ve given up pretty much.
---
Core thief is currently [meta in PvP](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Thief_-_Marauder_S/D).  Core [Guardian](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Burst_Burning) and [Warrior](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Warrior_-_Greataxe) also have some good builds if you don't like Thief's playstyle.
---
I use exalted on my necro
---
Pretty much, yes.
---
Again, most of the time with rares only a certain type of weapons are worth selling on the TP (greatswords, maybe swords and staves), and exotics if you're a new player are also worth salvaging (unless they're worth some gold on the TP) because you can get some accountbound materials needed for crafting that you will eventually need.
---
Oh, I like this one. Lore friendly yet unique
---
start raiding and its basically just a time investment. pre HoT: 3 asc chars because cba crafting more also no gold since i was no farmer.  
---
after half a year: 12 full sets. now: arround 26 full sets.
---
Only the raid one does that. Others are just shiny versions of their precursors with glowing bits. What really gets it for me is the textures and color accuracy of the gem store outfits are just better than pvp/wvw legendary. The only armor in this entire game that **feels** as legendary as it looks is the raid set. It makes the noobs stop and stare, because it is rare (sry). And people like rare and unique things.
---
Also many of the new armors they have been slowly adding and the gemstore armorsets look better than most of the ones in game. Swapping between gem store outfits every now and then is the way to go for fashion whales.
---
no mate, I dont DO achievements , they do themselfs while I DO the content. Next thing you will say it shat menu is content, options panel is content...
---
The ones I see perform well are:  
---
\- Core thief (Sword / Dagger roamer) (very hard to play properly)
---
\- core warrior (PowerDPS Axe/Shield + GS build) (Easy to play, hard to master)
---
\- Core ele (idk ele too much, but I've seen some very powerfull Scepter/dagger and Dagger/Dagger core eles. Beware this class is very hard to play well)
---
\- Core nekro (I have no idea about this class, sorry.)
---
\- Core guard (good old hammer build)
---
\- core ranger (phew phew LB / GS power DPS build can be very strong)
---
&gt; Elite specs are by far the thing that would yield the most results for the least amount of work.
---
Sorry but that is an insane statement. Elite specs are one of the most time consuming things you can make. It's a ton of design work up front and if the class doesn't work you have to start over or keep reworking them for years as we've seen with Daredevil/Scrapper/Chrono/... 
---
Every new spec you add has less benefit because less players permanently switch from other classes, unless the new specs are completely overpowered. Yet you also have the same amount of extra work balancing them every patch in the future or the community gets mads about the forgotten class. From a cost/benefit point of view that is exactly the kind of feature you kill first.
---
Seems like you can, yes.
---
Yeah but then you're playing dead content that everyone else already grinded and left you behind. Might as well just play a singleplayer RPG.
---
This company is just a meme at this point. They talk about releasing new content every month and mention Halloween and Christmas, which I bet are gonna be the same stuff with the only addition of some new outfits/weapons skin. This is so sad
---
Have you checked out dulfy? She might have a guide on how to get to that point.
---
you talk from your ass, you dont know any of it. You are one of these blind reddit drones that for some reason got focused on "we dont need new map every episode" because of 1 fuckup with Kourna map. And you guys dont realise what are you saying. You just gave anet excuse to work even less on their game. Giving us even less content. Maps will be the same, but instead of 1 new every 4 months we will get half of the map every 3.  In half a year I expect apology from you, just send my PM and say you were wrong and you are sorry. I will forgive you.
---
I dont think its like that, we're nearing the end of a pretty long content drought after all.
---
It's just insular.  You need a specialized guild for just about every activity because people loathe lugging outside of prime time.
---
Brandberg is Kralkatorrik's middle name
---
Sure so what you need to do is to look at your keyboard and there should be a key saying Screenshot, press that one and then find the screenshot in the screenshot map somewere on your pc and upload it. 
---
Your welcome :)
---
agree, we are getting downvoted but the truth is guys who say we dont need new map every episode are wrong. They for some reason thing we will get more this way, but we wont. This is anet. We will get less because of it. I asked biggest gw2 streamers and they are actually on our side, they are afraid we will get less content now. (Deroir, WP, Teapot)
---
The content has been played for years, not 24 hours. Ls3 maps are oooold af
---
Left: a funny player who used his imagination to create something "original" using the tools provided by the game. It might not fit the world of gw2 but I appreciate the idea
---
Right: an abomination and an example of what drove gw2 to ruin

---
the selling point was that the game will be good, so they failed from the start? Whats your point? So they didnt say a world about what will happen with the game at start so now they dont need to add anything new as it wasnt selling point? Do you have brain problems? your arguments are horrible, please dont say anything more.
---
this guy is a troll or a retard dont let him get to you my man
---
That wasn't a point supporting elite specs in any way? Read my statement again.
---
Why I am afraid of this expanding map thing:  
---
I think adding random stuff to old maps like season 2 did is stupid as it stay like that and year later it dont fit in anyway. New players see mordremoth things in Iron marches or kessex while doing personal story from 2012 and are confused.   
---
  
---
It could work if the new things would be in new areas that are only available to players doing the new story. Or if it would use that fancy tech that only players who should see them will see them.  
---
Now what if this expanding would only add things to new maps? It could work but again they need to make sure that players who will be entering this maps first time will only see what then should see. Think about drytop, you enter it now and see a village destroyed by mordremoth but story say at start that everything is ok? People are happy but their friends are dead and their bodies are hanging from the vines? WTF. Again if they use this new tech, or make sure that orygnal story is done in instances so they can have old oryginal areas in the story missions and "new" updated in open world it would work (like old LA in story missions).  
---
Now the biggest problem I have with expansing map vs adding map every epidose is that for now I think it will mean we will get less. But I hope I am wrong and it will mean we will get less but 2 times more frequent so overall more. Lets hope thats the case.
---
We already got the trailer and teasers.
---
When you don't see bugged portraits - it is not running.
---
Nice, im always a fan of RPG Maker games, will defiantly look into it.
---
In my opinion and not trying to chaise you off yes a bit silly. I mean i get it that it is frustration involved i would likely be that as well, but it is a misstake that you did so just make a new mail, there are many mail providers out there that can give you a mail adress on the fly. 
---
And since you already know how you want your character to look like the creation will go fast and in a few min you will be with your friend and playing and this first insident will be gone and forgotten about :)
---
Make sure to pick the right region and even though servers do not matter for PvE they do for WvW so make sure to pick the server he is on. And then it is settled :)
---
Welcome to the game and i hope this first experience wont stop your from playing this awsome game :)
---
He can not do so on a f2p account. When he buy the expansions he get a free move though but not until then.
---
You are ugly, my light legendary armor is beautiful, spikes and all
---
He even wrote that he picked the wrong region....
---
ok so if from now on anet only add achievements  to the game. Achievements  like: jump 1000 times, open hero panel 100 times. Open TP and see whats in the gemstore 200 times. You will be ok with this as it is content right? if achievements  are content we dont need anything other. But thats now true right? so you are wrong here my friend.   
---
Achievements to do Tarir 100 times is not content. TARIR IS CONTENT. Achievement is just a pointer to content or a checklist of what content you did.  
---
End of the story. You lost.
---
He can not do that on a f2p account. You can not move a f2p account at all.
---
Don't expect and don't hype yourself.  If it happens, great.  If it doesn't and you didn't expect, you won't be disappointed.
---
Look if you have some unfinished achievements, there is more ways to get mastery points and you will have surplus of them at the end anyways. You can grab some from next map as well, or story should give some too.
---
Can confirm. Some random core warrior legit destroyed me in WvW 2 times.
---
Yes for the saga doesn't mean they can't do individual trailers for each release.
---
Armor?
---
Yyyeeeesssss
---
As is said already—map completion. All the beginning level maps are so different and gorgeous in their own way. City map completion too. My favorite is Divinity’s Reach. I also learned the hard way—if you’re interested in crafting at all, you have to level up in it,too, so harvest as much as possible on the first level maps. Copper and jute are needed in access and I kept having to return over and over to get more. The other important thing is getting the required hero points to build up the skills your character needs to accomplish harder things—your character’s “build”.   Upgrade armor and weapons, too, as often as you can.
---
No problem :)
---
Great..now I want a dark version of fear not this night from Jormag &gt;.&gt;
---
It’s more like there’s a chance for an easy 50g, more realistically it’s consistently between 25-50.  If you’re below 25 then there’s definitely some opportunity for maximized profits that you’re missing. I pretty much hoard loot through my fractal sessions instead of depositing anything, because I have the bag space, and when I’m done I go ahead and get selling, between junk drops, loot, gold rewards, and what have you, I never come out below 25.
---
I think part of why people aren’t raking in the profits is because they hoard stuff they don’t really need.
---
Yes.. In PvE, WvW and PvP all have distinct sets
---
if only ranger could wield other weapons. shame that melee weapons are off the table.
---
To be fair to anet, when they made the game DX12 didn’t exist. 
---
Also, they chose to target dx9 because of the popularity of MMOs including GW1 with people who don’t run proper gaming hardware, dx9 was more accessible. 
---
Any choice to move to dx12 would mean either abandoning support for the many non win10 users or supporting both concurrently. Note, there are bugs with this implementation they’d have to iron out for an official release and they’d have to make sure future releases work on both. 
---
That said, I think they should release an official dx12 option at this point as well as a higher texture level/other visual options for future content.
---
If you’re in that situation then you may as well just run the game at a higher resolution or rely on DSR/VSR/supersampling.
---
You know.. I tried ESO and got so bored so quickly but this is fun and interesting.. moreso than most MMOs I've played (which, admittedly is not a huge number).
---
Bard on a mesmer using warhorn would make sense, or even focus.
---
There are multiple skins for those those weapons that look like instruments.
---
Would be funny to make people dance to death as you kill them as well.
---
Cleric's and Paladins however would not make sense as all the gods have left
---

Wasn't it already stated that they were to be introductory raid difficulty? In a game where raids are already fairly easy that should have told you all you need to know. Strikes are basically 10man instanced version of world bosses, which is what the people saying they can't get into raiding wanted.
---
You could always try it out for yourself. 
---
You’re the best person to check if the game is currently utilising your own hardware effectively.
---
He said before some date. The legendary backpacks weren't there at HoT launch.
---
Boosted me from low/mid settings at 60fps to sll maxed out 60fps! Thank you so much! (i5 2500, gtx1650, 8gb ram)
---
nah it's just mean
---
it's also more of a maze than your usual JP
---
I dont think non legendary bows leave special arrow effects.
---
Skills can change the way arrows look like (poison, burning arrows etc)
---
Besides the mentioned already, azureflame bows have special animations when you take it from your back into your hands (enter combat), a small sound as well, and have a very unique blue flame animation
---
About a week ago. Gotta wait for actual DX12 support I guess
---
Really ? what did I miss? Didn’t play since I finished skyscale collections . Did just got back and currently  lvling Mesmer to get used to the game again
---
i m a simple charr, i hear that, i press like
---
&gt;If only we had dates for the raid and fractal updates.
---
Mike Z said a generic "we're working on that" and only when the interviewer *specifically* asked for them.
---
They're not coming. 
---
Everything is "being worked on", Anet doesn't want any backlash right before an update that can potentially bring lots of new players to the game.
---
ok I'll have to find out about the open world events. I do see notifications "An event is nearby" .. is that it?
---
You have a map restriction up to a certain level and you can't visit lion arch until level 35.
---
I expect 2?
---
Yup.  Doing those is the quickest way to level.  Stick around after one completes as it may chain into another.
---
&gt; Everything else they're telling also sounds nice, and as expected, they're still working on raids and fractals. Those select people that have been screaming "strike missions will replace raids lol" like retarded kestrels ever since August 30th will take some more time to acknowledge it, though. ;)
---
WvW restructure would like a word outside
---
They said that yes, and then announced season 5 starts with a new map, and then episode 1 and 2 share what I believe is a second new map that evolves between 1 and 2. Not sure how that qualifies as what OP was asking for.
---
Does "old lions arch" count?
---
Besides this, I'm always staggered by the main cities of human, norn and sylvari. I also love the durmand priory. And I like the whole area of lornars pass in general.
---
Anything bare hands combat wouldn't work.
---
OP asked for less maps that instead get expanded on, Anet plans on doing less maps that instead get expanded on.
---
Down voted for using an emoji.
---
At this point Anet shipping things on reasonable schedule would cause subverted expectations.
---
&gt; Stop adding maps and start reworking existing ones
---
No, he asked for no new maps.
---
A long long time ago (probably back in 2012), I remember there was two specific spots in Frostgorge that you could farm Ancient Bones and Elaborate Totems lol. I haven't done something like that in a long time, especially now that you can get a lot by buying the Trophy Shipments. And yes, the Rich Node Farm is the one that you just waypoint to those rich iron and plats and others.
---
Meh, sounds like she's trying too hard to make it sound like Maclaine Diemer's version.
---
Dude, there is literally Ogre on Crystal Oasis map that talk with Ogre kid about that you could not tame Branded animals.
---
Yeah, one day I'll do a Cursed Shore old school champ train. I'm curious to see what that's like now a days. At the moment I only have a Malchors Leap champ train from the week where everyone was killing central tyrian champs for the Marks.
---
HoT was the peak of GW2 period. :)
---
I just wish you could deposit them into your guild and there wasn't the limit of 25 banners of each type in the guild storage.
---
&gt;DSR/VSR
---
Oh! would this improve my fps? how do i activate DSR/VSR?
---
use the search function. there's been like 4 threads that I've seen already
---
Most of Timberline Falls is a thing of pure natural beauty.
---
Some areas in Blazeridge Steppes like Heretic Plain and Unbroken Expanse are worth fighting for.
---
Hiden area in the [Grove](http://puu.sh/Efz63/5f84c19344.jpg) is one of my favorite!
---
Guardians were based partially on GW1's Paragon class whose skills included various song-like skill types (Though [no singing](https://getyarn.io/yarn-clip/f5cce83d-3082-47c1-ad5f-3d50c8b14d38))  Some were offensive though most tended to be defensive.  
---
A singing, spear chucking, heavy armor wearing soldier of the Golden Sun!  And they didn't run around trying to sleep with everything.
---
Pretty much all of Langmar Estate in Plains of Ashford. Especially the end.
---
The cooler raid encounters *do* use neat mechanical stuff for the fight's lore. Dhuum is my personal favorite with protecting the Reapers of Grenth as they conduct a ritual to seal Dhuum.
---
My hope is that they have difficulty and mechanics at around the level of the Broken King encounter in Hall of Chains. That fight without the ticking time limit (dps check) would be amazing as a  intro to raids
---
The megaservers really help to keep areas alive and well. Wvw... not as much, some servers are just terrible and some are better.
---
More than that. You're looking for orange on the map, orange circles denote the boundaries of the map. Orange skulls are bosses. Orange baskets are collection events. Orange shields are either escorts or protection events.
---
Make sure to look at the text on the upper right of your screen it will tell you the goal of a specific event when you're in the event area.
---
Events can chain into longer events,, like quest chains in other games. Some of them take up large portions of the map and are pretty complex. Those are called meta events. 
---
In one case a meta event takes up an entire map and takes an hour. It's almost like an open world raid. Events are the bread and butter of the open world in this game.
---
Hearts are there to keep people in areas were many events spawn, but there are rarer events that spawn in other places as well.
---
Pedal tones are nice.
---
True man, but at the same time i feel like the fact that its not used often gives the song itself more weight.
---
I could definitely see us getting a Brawler type of Warrior elite spec, and instead of having a burst attack on F1 they instead get a "bundle" that just visually disarms them. This way it uses the weapon stats still and allows them to make new or unique animations for each skill. They can also limit the cooldown to share the weapon swap cooldown.
---
Yeah but it would be worse than going the extra mile. One- is it an exclusive weapon just for one elite spec/class. Two, low amount of skins and three, it would conflict with gloves skins. Balancing the stats isn't actually that hard, just have the elite spec give 130 (or something) all stats base. And hey, if they somehow can code it, we already have a metric ton of glove skins. Some gemstore ones are even pretty cool for it like chaos.
---
That is fucking sick.
---
I can totally see how if you'd played since launch you could have that perception. I bought the game around launch my sophomore year of college, dabbled in it a bit, but really didn't get into it until my senior year when I was only taking a few classes and had hours upon hours of time to kill while my friends were in class. HoT came out sixish months after I graduated when I had no life outside of work and waiting for my days off to travel home to see my fiance and friends. During that period the game filled a void in my life and I remember it being an incredible experience.
---
For the Orr farm, I didn't do a single event. There may or may not have been an event while passing through that I accidentally got credit for, but the focus was on the nodes. I went from Siren's Landing -&gt; Straits of Devastation -&gt; Malchor's -&gt; Cursed. I'm sure the numbers are a little higher now due to the recent patch where herbs can drop more rare loots
---
Boon corruption.

Am I too late for this?
---
All containers and champ bags were opened on a level 80 character. I excluded any rare drops that were over a gold since that's pretty rare to get. Only Bags of Gear from Silverwastes is where I opened those on a level 49 character
---
&gt; Me for years: "I hope no one ever finds out I usually gear for precision."
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; WP: "Assassins is good."
---
&gt; Me: "Validated."
---
Assassins is actually worse in solo open world. Since you aren't Might capping there is a very good chance you are well below the breakpoint in most builds where Precision &gt; Power. Thus, each piece of assassins gear is a detriment to you DPS. I don't mean to be critical of WP but this isn't good theorycraft.
---
Do you have a specific route on the different maps or are you just running from one visible node to the next one?
---
It wasn't a selling feature because it was added later. I do stand corrected that there are three glider skins you can earn; all of which are tied to legendary equipment acquired from wvw/pvp/fractals. I suppose I mean to say that there aren't any glider skins available specifically from the expansion.
---
The funny thing is with my current system even with this mod the CPU is so under utilised that’s it takes running the game maxed out at 4K AND supersampling to hit full usage on my GTX 1080. That’s overkill of course so I just stick with lower usage and quieter fans. 
---
The biggest difference is seeing the lower FPS values raised. My old system got occasional single digit drops. With this mod and a 3900x even big zergs keep it above 30fps. I’ve not played WvW in a while though so I’ve not seen how it runs in a lag fest 3x Zerg clash yet.
---
AB and VB I need to test it again. There's a red mark on the date next to their name reminding me that it's way overdue lol. That's also why they don't have a spreadsheet of their own yet. I will try and do them soon. I remember when I did test them out, I got those low numbers was because both AB and VB were very linear in their events outside of the meta. Because of that, it goes like: 1 long event -&gt; another long event -&gt; another. TD is only temporarily linear with their pre-events, then bang bang bang. Event after event after event. That's why that one is so high with the shiny baubles. 
---
Farm train of Sunny?
---
Charr and norn get especially punished here. There are weapons and backpieces that are impossible to fully preview in the wardrobe due to a lack of zoom. Banner of the Commander comes to mind, I had no idea what the top half looked like until after crafting it.
---
Hey thanks! Glad you like it
---
I do, but I'm a hopeless dreamer :S  
---
Either way, we'll see in 2.5h.
---
It really depends on what you are trying to do.  You can get full ascended gear by playing solo. Just takes some time.  In my experience I've used guides are more a template you can adapt to your play style.  If you already have ascended gear and a good rotation. You may have to set other goals to challenge yourself.
---
seemed pretty nice until 0:15
---
I mean there were no book weapons, but Firebrand became a thing. Just gotta think outside the box for it. They could have 'kits' become a thing for mesmer, where you just equip various instruments to do a loadout of related spells for it. Or just turn your shatters into actives that have you whipping out an instrument for their cast time, giving them much bigger radius and effects.
---
*There's a world of possibilities for the classic fantasy classes, I promise you.*
---
You may try the boots from the virgils, they arquote "natural" too
---
From description: "Originally by Maclaine Diemer &amp; Jeremy Soule. Dark version inspired by Maclaine's version."
---
Somewhat of a route. More of a broad route than a head-on specific one. For example, in Siren's Landing, I go from [&amp;BOUJAAA=] and go north til I reach the river and go west from there. In Straits, I go from [&amp;BFgGAAA=] and go south til the tip of the island. If [&amp;BPgCAAA=] is open, I go there too. Otherwise, Malchors I go to [&amp;BIcCAAA=] and go to the wood farm. Then I just go from East to West generally. For Cursed, I go from North to South generally. 
---
I didn't gather focus on specific nodes either because one day (it's possible) that some of these nodes will either increase or decrease in price. It would be nice to see the trend of how that will impact the Gold Per Hour of that map. Example: Omnomnom Berries used to worth something, and now they're not.
---
Thank YOU, I saw few of this but you find a lot :).
---
Nah, I'm really not. I've had issues with the system since early season 3.
---
And no, I will literally never like the living story system. Haven't played a single ls4 and never intend to.
---
7 years and gw only has 1 memorable song. feelsbad :( they should start putting out theme songs for each expansions going forward ;(
---
Imagen going on a thread and not being constructive.
---
I play *mostly* solo, not all the time.
---
As I said, I enjoy doing solo stuff, while also having fun on world bosses or event runs.
---
But those doesn’t require any socialisation and relatively no interaction: you tag in, follow commander, dps, loot, tag out.
---
It could be compared to playing with npcs, just like story mode.
---
Ok so, the storyline quests (the green stars) are not your main leveling content. They're your Personal Story, they kinda guide you to some new areas and give you the main story of the game, but they're not going to give you nearly enough XP to level up and they're also not going to take you to most areas of the game. 
---
What you should primarily be doing to level up is exploring and completing maps (getting all the hearts, vistas, points of interest, and waypoints) and doing dynamic events (the orange circles that pop up on your map occasionally. Dynamic events tend to appear around hearts, but they can also appear anywhere, and sometimes talking with people can trigger them too so you're rewarded for exploring the world and interacting with stuff. 
---
Also, if you finish your starting zone (for a norn that's Wayfarer's Foothills) you can move either move on to the next higher zone or you can go do another race's starting zone. For a norn, you have two options for your 15-25 level zone, one to the north east of your starting zone (a charr-focused area in Ascalon), one to the north west (a norn-focused area in the Shiverpeaks). Your story will probably take you to the northwest zone when you get to lvl20, so you can either go there early and explore a bit, unlock some WPs, etc, or you can go to the charr area and quest a bit and then move to the norn area when you get to lvl20 and follow your story. 
---
There is really no wrong way to level up. That's why it's so open-ended. The Personal Story is the only part of the game that is really linear and will tell you "go here, do this". The rest of it is figuring out what you like to do and exploring the world. Basically everything you do gives you XP and helps you level. Remember to kill mobs wherever you go, they give good XP, especially mobs that have been sitting untouched for a while (they build up bonus XP when they're not killed).

Paging for u/nagennif
---
wouldn't be an issue if we could toggle/move/resize UI elements but... yeah
---
I see... So overall, some multiplayer content is much needed to get your hands on those.
---
Is it easy to tag in a random group or do you have to play with people you know? 
---
Also, i guess there are some professions that have a much higher demand regarding multiplayer pve. In your opinion, which are the most researched ones?
---
Yeah, I needed full.
---
Why not glass cannon it? It isn't like open world content punishes you for doing so and mobs go down faster because of it. 
---
Since most HoT champs hero points are soloable in mostly glass builds there really are few risks to just going all out on the damage front.
---
TBH This reminds me on FFXIV where they said they were going from 3 to 2 dungeons per patch and then 2 to 1 or 2 dungeons per patch. They said this would be to increase content or quality in other areas, but that never happened.
---
You might find this an interesting page: [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Block](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Block)

It's a placeholder.

it's not my problem that you cannot accept a simple fact without unnecessary statistics that we have no way of getting.
---
It is a cover.
---
I hope so.

Throwing the baby out with the bathwater is a reasonable solution for software development. /s
---
The metas of these two maps just feel more alive, more living. Take Thunderhead Peaks for example: in the Thunderhead Keep meta you clear the branded and kill that big thing aswell. Does this change the map, you thought, no the brandstorm is gonna come anyway. In Dry Top clearing event and ranking up the sandstorm spawns new events in other places. It just feels like you actually change the map instead of just hitting mobs.
---
It's supposed to be a tool that's meant to expose lazy and idiotic people playing the game.
---
It's a secret project ANet has been working on to hard expose people.
---
I think it's working pretty well.
---
Legendary tier, which has the same stats as ascended but has extra convenience features. We'll probably get more gear stat combinations, but not more tiers of gear

Really what's your fucking point? He's doing such a good job and you go to piss him with your hate and your shit???

Well we get trailers for festivals be kind of stupid not to do it for a living world update.

Well, i'm sorry.  But if you dont like the mmo part in an mmorpg, why dont you play an rpg? There are planty out there which give you countless hours to play.
---
As far as gear rarity goes, [Ascended](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_equipment) (pink) and [Legendary](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_equipment) (purple) have the highest stats. [Exotic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exotic_equipment) (gold) has about 5% lower stats than Ascended or Legendary, but is much, much easier to get. 
---
It's been confirmed that we won't get any new rarities with higher stats. 
---
As far as stat combinations go, though, you need to look up what's best for your role. Snowcrows and Metabattle have info about that for meta builds in scenarios such as raids, fractals, and PvP.

Queensdale has a lot, from the little fisher house to the small waterfall near the entrance of divinity reach with an overview of the map. That map is still my favorite in the game, such an immersive feeling when I play there
---
Enjoy my power point presentation on GW2 xD
---
No, there are indeed TP bots.  I was pointing out the bad example and misunderstanding of the behavior of the item given.
---
They have never put dates on anything until it's almost coming out. That simply is the way it goes with development everywhere(Compare it to something like DLC for Smash Bros Ultimate for example, when they announced the Hero/Banjo characters, the releasedates were slated as "Summer" and "Fall", respectively. They simply couldn't specify it any further ahead because there are simple uncertainties at play when developing software.)
---
I also don't know if you're on NA or something, but for me on EU it's simply business as usual when it comes to raiding. I haven't seen any vets quiting that I normally play with, and the LFG is just as active as it has been for months.
---
You are right in saying they are the generic horse of their respective type but you still can't deny that it is 8 distinct and unique "generic horses". And saying this is just as bad as the selection between "the gray horse the brown horse or the dotted horse" (if i remember correctly from another buy2play game) to me seems like an exaggeration.
---
Ascendent from exotics only gives a small stat boost compared to exotics from rare gear.

But only ascendant gear can be infused with agony resistances, as well as +5 stat infusions (also there for min maxing)
---
Playing trough fractals as they are intended , from low lvl to higher tiers, doing dailies for extra rewards etc, can be a fun way to "progress" trough exotic&gt;ascendant gear.
---
Tho random, and sometimes rare, you get ascendant accessories, sometimes even boxes with armor pieces (or weapons) from fractals.
---
You can also craft ascendant gear your self, any stats, but it can be very costly.
---
A lot of season 3 episodes can give you ascendant accessories, the bloodstone ones can also be stat swapped for a small price.
---
Stst swapping was a typo, i ment stat swapping
---
Dungeons are less played and havent gotten any updates in years. Can still be fun, and rewarding in terms of exp gain, small gold gain, and dungeon tokens for special exotic gear with unique skins.
---
Fractals are very profitable,more challenging and more so in higher tiers, and more rewarding. You can also craft a legendary backpack / glider from fractals.
---
Raids usually require you to know your raid specific profession build, its rotation, the boss encounters, and having other 9players that can do the same.
---
Take it easy, ask for training guilds, watch some youtube raid guides , get proper food and try them out.
---
Note that people have cleared all raids without a full meta comp by now, with teams like 8man, 5man, 10man necros, using green gear instead of exotic/ascendant and so on.
---
So its really how much you know your class, rotation and the understanding the boss mechanic rather than stats and meta comps (tho it does help people who know them to do them faster and more efficiently)
---
I'm pretty sure Shattered Aegis triggers the Justice passive. With permeating wrath too you could deal some awesome AoE dmg with blocks. Have fun!
---
I bet you'll find out.
---
My PC isn't even that good. GTX770 and i5-4460. That's 2014 build I think. The thing is when yippy got like up to 10 players on the screen game runs buttery smooth and once there be 50... Oh boy, power point presentation. Optimisation is an issue and vfx scaling.
---
While I do agree that end game content is a bit more strict, I could not more recomend the approach of OP of playing with traits and skills. This is the best way to know what you are doing at high level. There are a lot of people copy pasting build which do not understand the base mechanics of the game like boons, conditions, weapon swap. Generally they are the people who cannot raid for two weeks after a balance patch drops because "SC website is not updated". 
---
To OP: have fun with expeeirmenting with build but be open if you touch high end content because in these activities the builds have been optimized to create a team synergy and, at least for PUG, you will be expected to follow those builds.
---
No!
---
How does that answer make you feel?
---
I’ll tell you in one hour.
---
:D it's okay if you disagree with that. I'm not saying it wouldnt be great to have something like a fully dyeable version earnable in game but i feel like people rarely acknowledge the selection they have by default.
---
Hear, hear!
---
Are there any good guides out there for getting Core Tyria mastery points? Should I just go through and get the "commune" ones for each zone? I've been maxed on experience for a week and it feels like a waste.
---
Elite specs take time and effort to make, but compared to other kinds of content I think it's very fair to say they take less effort.
---
On the design side, writing a story is no small task. Planning out the broad strokes takes a lot of bouncing ideas around, trying things, getting almost done and then deciding you need to start over, etc. Then comes the stage of going from broad strokes to writing dialogue which is the same thing all over again but even more time consuming, along with sorting out all of the other details. This stage is going to have even more points where you need to throw something away and go back and start over at an earlier place. 
---
If you're making a new map for a story release, raid release, or fractal, THAT is going to be by far the biggest time consumer. It's mind boggling to think what's involved. Now they seem to have cut this in part - they're going to do things in older maps. That doesn't mean they aren't doing *some* new maps, though, and to reiterate: making a new map is a mind boggling amount of work.
---
Whether you're making a new map or not, you need to design new boss encounters and mechanics. You are often introducing other new mechanics for other parts of the stories, too, and ArenaNet said in their announcement that they are doing some very different mechanics in the new season. This all takes not only design but a great deal of *coding* work, too. It's a lot of work.
---
I'm just scratching the surface here.
---
Elite specs, on the other hand, DO take work, but do they take as much? They take a lot of design work, yes. I'd argue that it's probably on par with all the design work that goes into planning out new story content. For one thing, remember that a lot of the elite specs stuff that they're designing just comes down to re-using or putting slight twists on designs they already have. In other words, it's not like you start with a blank slate. You start with all of the mechanics, weapon and utility skills, traits, and skill/trait archetypes  that are already in the game and reuse them or change them slightly to add a little different flavor. Yes, it will take a lot of work to flesh each spec out, but it's not significantly more or even necessarily more work than design work in other areas of the game.
---
Frankly I think the response here is pretty simple: they do plan to have some new maps, and that's simply more design work than elite specs. 
---
Then you move on to coding, and elite specs are also going to take some work but you're remember already starting with a lot of the code to do what these new elite specs already do. It's not as if there's no effort involved in taking code that does one thing in a Thief skill and adapting it to do something similar in a Ranger skill, but it's also not as if you're starting with nothing. A significant amount of what needs to be done is already there.
---
This is on EU servers by the way.
---
I've run Marauder's gear in PvE for years now. I enjoy the slight DPS trade off for a buttload of extra health. Glad to see I am ahead of the curve on this. :D
---
The wiki is an excellent source for these types of things.
---
I actually wouldnt be surprised if they do this today or next week. I have been harvesting will all gathering boosts stacked the last couple of days and have got an average of 28 herbs from 12 nodes/3 plots
---
25 minutes to find out
---
Bard could also be associated with a bow, though Mesmer x Warhorn seems the most likely for GW2. Mesmer x Bow + Song skills? 
---
Sadly don't see room for a punchy-monk concept. Closest we got was Daredevil. 
---
Guardian already covers Paladin and/or Cleric.   
---
Chrono is basically our Time Mage.  
---
Engi covers Alchemist.  
---
No land spears, so no Lancers. 
---
Doubt we'll see anything like a Summoner, either. Rev is more of a medium, not a "cast wide area effects from giant eidolons" kinda thing.
---
:(
---
):
---
I think you're wrong about this. Most of the few times I have actually opened up my wallet and spent gems are the times when I had new elite specs to play around with, which in turn made me want to design a cool new thematic look for my characters. These sorts of things also got me buying black lion keys hoping to hit it big so I could buy the expensive new weapon skin I needed to go with my look. 
---
I'm not even, by any means, a hardcore Fashion Wars 2 player - or anything close.
---
I'd bet that my experience is by no means unique. More critically, the new elite specs just had me generally excited to play the game which had me more generally looking to spend some cash on whatever happened to be tempting me at the moment. I don't think that's unique, either.
---
I can't wait to see a 5s teaser omg
---
I feel exactly the same. My guild fell apart right as HoT came out and stuck until several months after PoF came out, literary got the Griffin and then stopped playing, because I realised that all guild I'm in no longer active and maybe it was time for me to move on too.
---
Well i wasn't even thinking about untill your post. Why u hyping me up mannn
---
I think they should follow the same pattern they have for glider skins. 95% of them are gemstore, with legendary back items providing a matching glider. If there were a legendary item per major game mode that gave a set of mount skins it'd be as satisfied as I'd be broke building the thing.
---
Hey, my instrumental's missing! /s
---
For sure, I was just wondering if there were any commonly known ones that are easy to grab
---
&gt; For sure, I was just wondering if there were any commonly known ones that are easy to grab
---
Get the commune ones. They're easy. 
---
There are four legendary bosses in the Silverwastes that each reward one, and another one for all four. Find out where they are and just keep an eye on map chat - they all spawn near the Silverwaste RIBA bases. You can probably get them all in a few hours, but they do go down quickly. The jumping puzzle is long but not very hard and rewards another one. 
---
The Karka Queen is easy in a group. Check the LFG at about the right time and join a squad. Defeating Tequatl is another "just turn up and do what the squad does" one. There are a lot associated with Triple Trouble, but they're much harder. 
---
Bowing to the colossus and dancing with the holograms in fractals are easy as you just have to bow or dance in the right place at the right time.
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/d20jxm/no_one_else_expects_prologue_trailer_tomorrow/
---
Imagine how many mount skins you could buy if you sunk a subscription fee's worth of money every month into mount skins.
---
I am not expecting a trailer for a prologue. Would be pleasantly surprised, though.
---
My situation with the guild was a bit different. Guild leader and I never got along, but I loved everyone else in the guild so I put up with him. He all but forbade me from teaching other guildies how to do dungeons/fractals because I would tell them to get familiar with a meta build and at least be working towards getting the correct gear. 
---
Eventually he kicked me out of the guild because he whispered something to me that set me off and I called him an asshat. 
---
I stuck around in the game a bit after that, but my life changed (got married, built a life in a new city, etc.), I bought a PS4 and have just been playing that with some of my old buddies since then.
---
Awesome, thanks! I know I've gotten Teq and KQ and I think I've gotten at least a couple of the Silverwaste bosses, but I'll check out the others.
---
For normal t4s fractals anything is okay, cm groups usually play specific classes and compositions. You can just join any group on lfg depending on your agony resistance unless they have special requirements. Be aware thief has strong dps but its extremely squishy.  Other ez class to play is dragonhunter/soulbeast/scourge but overall normal fractal groups usually are open to everyone. They are actually quite fun and a nice change of pace from playing solo all the time. Also the most lucrative content in game atm.
---
Ye, I know, those don't bring much new, but they are still essential for having good game. Can you imagine going back to not have unidentified gear all around your bags?
---
If you learn where they spawn, literally just move between the two bases during the right phase and you'll run into them eventually. 
---
At the end of Cliffside, /bow to the titan and /dance with the holograms in Aetherblade. You get one for killing Horrick in Mai Trin, which you'll do as part of it normally. The chickens one isn't particularly hard, although you need to advertise it on the LFG as the chickens one or you'll annoy people.
---
Any word from anet on this?
---
World 3 would be exciting. Right now, to me, SAB is a series of dailies to collect every orange / red skin.
---
its https://wiki.guildwars2.com/index.php?title=Unnamed_trophy_(Champion_Mark) you can find out by writing /wiki and then shift clicking the item
---
And in my instance, I straight up quit the game. Leggy armor deserves gemstore outfit treatment.
---
Interrupt mesmer from GW1.
---
GW1 mesmer was the most fun I ever had in a PvP game anyway. Made me feel like I was playing a control blue mtg deck but in real time.
---
The elder dragons leak magic very slowly while they sleep, so there would be no need to manage that.  
---
Aurene's job is keep the magic circulating, and sharing it rather than absorbing as much as she can.  
---
The elder dragons are corrupted by their own magic and will not do that, they only consume until they are full.   
---
I doubt Aurene can control them, so she can't keep them from doing that.  When she shares the magic, the elder dragons would still take it.    
---
That means there's only two ways to deal with the other elder dragons: replace them, or cleanse them and transform them into sharers.   
---
The Forgotten tried to create a way to cleanse Kralkatorrik, but they failed. The first succeeded in cleansing Glaust into Glint, but their attempt to cleanse Kralkatorrik ended up with them being branded instead.  That was plan B, which they attempted as a last ditch effort to survive as Kralkatorrik invaded the Crystal Desert.  
---
If you look at the representation of the All in Omadd's machine and Taimi's simulation, in the center there's a huge orb with lots of bright dots over it, with another orb inside just as big as the dragon orbs.
---
https://youtu.be/XYY-41xUZLk
---
I always thought that the small dots scattered over the large transparent orb are living things in Tyria, ambient magic, leylines and the like, scattered over the surface of the world, and the central orb is what the Pale Tree refers as  "the Soul of Tyria". 
---
If we assume I'm right, and the core orb inside the large or is indeed the "Soul of Tyria", what exactly this "Soul of Tyria" is?   
---
A 7th dragon called Tyria sleeping in the core of the planet, and the elder dragons have to keep draining magic or she  will wake up and destroy the world?    
---
An accumulation of the knowledge and experiences of all things that once lived in Tyria, and the Dream is tapping into it?    
---
Or maybe that orb and the dream are one and the same.    
---
And it could always be just a massive mass of pure leyline energy in the core of the world.  
---
Your guess is as good as mine.  
---
In any case, that central hexagon in the Kesho vision is likely also the "Soul of Tyria" orb, representing all the magic in Tyria, the magic in leylines, ambient magic, and also inside living things.
---
They learned of their past mistakes and not generate Hype anymore.
---
As Kurosov said, best is you try it out, it wont harm you and is installed quite quickly. Though I'd assume the ram you got is maybe bit low.
---
Well, its supposed to be celebration, it aint really main part of story, gimme sum metal.
---
Uhm what?  The prologue is Bound by Blood, which is what the trailer is for....?
---
"Bound by Blood" is the name of the prologue though?
---
Take your own advice. The prologue is “bound by blood” releasing on the 17th. Which is what the trailer is for. They are releasing at the same time.
---
Because it's not aimed at active players. They want to get some returning players.
---
Talk is cheap, is all I'm saying. "Alliances are coming! They're coming!" It's been hinted at since 2015. Just because they say they're doing something doesn't mean they'll do it.
---
&gt;Maybe they want to try something new and focus their marketing around the release day
---
That is stupid. Generating hype the very day the content releases won't do anywhere near as much as releasing it now and letting the trailer and the hype increase for a week.
---
Probably because next week is just the prologue and not the first episode of the season.
---
No u.
---
That's actually doable as long as you keep under 1000 calories a day. You eat 1000 or less calories of anything you want a day for a week, guaranteed weight loss.
---
Raids are simply put challenging 10 man content. Its the last thing you want to do in pve usually. Fractals - &gt; fractal cms - &gt; raids is a healthy progression path.
---
But rejoice, arenanet will implement strikes with the next releases, which are more accessible 10 man group content... s. So the progression path might be strike - &gt; raid
---
Fractal - &gt; cm then
---
Because people vaguely interested in it can be hyped into playing again NOW to get ready for this patch if the trailer was revealed today instead of giving us a short crappy teaser that says "wait till next week for the actual trailer".
---
Yes give the in pvp/wvw roaming hated mesmer dance moves to kill you. 
---
What's next thief gets shouts which are unmuteable insults and laughs. That would be great.^^
---
Nothing beats the very peak of Stormbluff Isle (Whispers base) when it’s raining. Especially with a view of the nearby lighthouse.
---
They're trying to imitate Warcraft's Elite Tauren Chieftains.
---
I don't think so. Not without some external tools that might be bannable. It's deceitfully large, too. But yeah, I usually attack him and dodge thrice, then disengage until my endurance fills up again, only hitting him for a second or two while it's filling up.
---
Seeing how most of others users a talking well about fractals, it seems like I really did miss not looking at those more in depth.
---
This is definitely on my to do list now, while checking on how to get my hands on ascended gear and infusions.
---
Thank you for the clarification
---
Ah yes, here's the real reason why the trailer didn't drop today, gotta keep the focus on the real prize.
---
Mike: *opens door* How far are you with the trailer?
---
Marketing (or whoever is responsible for it): T...trailer?
---
Mike: Yes... the.. trailer...? 
---
Marketing: Why do you want another trailer if the release date and map are already known? Was the one from the live event not enough?
---
Mike: Yeah but... we always did one.
---
Marketing: ...fine.... But it won't be ready for the 10th.
---
Mike: Doesn't matter, to be fair, we don't need one anyway since we already showed everything during the live event. *closes door*
---
*angry marketing noises*
---
Dead eye rifle simple rotation *cough
---
While the loop is short, its easy to drop modifyers which makes it one of the hardest rotations tbh.
---
I suggest you go to the training area at the lions arch aerodrome and do your rotation, add 10% dps to make up for ascended and another 2-3% for stat infusions. After you're done, compare it to the rifle benchmarks on snowcrows.com
---
Ah, hm. Could be.
---
Lets put the shatter back in shattered aegis instead huh anet.
---
Look up "secret location in the grove" or "iS8lsjE26y0" on YouTube for the most beautiful (hidden) location I have ever seen in the game
---
I don't think anyone hated outposts. Large meta events maybe, but definitely not outposts.
---
did you missed the last 2 weeks? they told us what will come. just nothing about the bigger story.
---
&gt;  Their marketing team should seriously be fired at this point.
---
Do they have one?
---
Yeah, she got some great covers. I'm a big fan of [her Wolven Storm one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ih8jjSxwoBM) from the Witcher 3.
---
Thancred was right.
---
Exordium is cooler, Gen 1s are......a thing.
---
Because the trailer is most likely not ready while already having confirmed the release date. They can't delay the release so there is no other choice than what they do now.
---
They released a magazine last week teasing the season/prologue, in case you weren't in the know.
---
Ayayay, its time for reddit to relax a bit xd at least these past months of drought, despite events and whatnot is finally coming to an end
---
Yes? Because that's the version she's covering..?  
---
She covered the original song a long time ago already.
---
Rekt
---
This is amazing Im literally laughing out loud at that idea
---
Gen 1 is cheaper
---
I SEE WHAT YOU DID THERE.
---
Technically, I don't see what you did there, but I DO.
---
Exordium is hands-down the best legendary ever made, beating out even Chuka &amp; Champawat and Nevermore.
---
The rest of the season is going to be really dark apparently so I don't mind this festival (including a charr band) as a prologue thing. Remember that, while a lot of players had Dragon Bash as a means to experience some sort of victory celebration after S4, everyone who finishes the release later will have no means to party except for this prologue. 
---
I think it's fine that they're doing this.
---
Wait, Metal Legion is a real thing and not just an ad?
---
Was browsing the thread and saw this comment, so forgive the jump in. I own Tyrian Tarot so I just want to clarify - We signed agreements and contracts for Tyrian Tarot (and all of our projects). We don't work without their approval, so while your comparison is valid, we also had to go through a long process to make sure everything was ok'd.
---
why is arenanet releasing the full trailer on the release day of the patch?
---
Exordium has pretty animations, but man those colors :''
---
even my dog is confused
---
I mean, the episode will be active for all new and old players forever, and will be the newest episode until November. Being there on launch day is not really necessary
---
Cheap plagiarism ;) -  this ["Bound by blood"-Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWCTlxEp6Ds&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=20) is the one and only :)
---
what about the two players in the middle?
---
It's because it goes beyond than what honestly should be given to the playerbse to equip.
---
This is relatively tame compared to the lighthouse-like appearance a *player* can take, and it has reached a point where it's unnacceptable.
---
It literally litters the playing field. It blinds other players from seeing what is actually going on in group content.
---
It looks ugly, and is a wound on the game's theme annd integrity.
---
I remember way, way back when people were [laughing at this](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/EyffaRi34-I/maxresdefault.jpg) saying how Guild Wars 2 would never look like this.
---
But it more or less turned into this.
---
It's a clown fiesta.
---
Why not all of them? It is only a dilemma if you are required to make a choice.
---
You should probably learn to read, might make you look a bit less dumb next time
---
Ah, okay... but still that's a very big communication issue on their side. I mean if they didn't even talk about if they play on EU or NA servers...
---
The comtent devs do not make the trailers
---
An elite spec could go the engineer-esque route and add a fn button to replace your current weapons skills and graphically put away your weapon.
---
Having the three (relay 6) together is what a hero’s banner is it just costs more to combine them.  Since they are separate then they could have different times and therefore would likely be unable to be combined into one buff. Now, if the dialog box could be removed that would be great, with that said it is absent if you are topping off buffs that you already have.  Also not needing to press F would be even better. 
---
Guild wars would really benefit from having buff fixed in the same location, so you can see clearly at a glance which ones you have/don’t have.
---
I have all of them and i will say Exordium, mostly for the beautiful animations.
---
ITT: People getting hyped to see a trailer for content they are already going to play and complaining that ANet doesn't want to hype people up.
---
So a timegated trailer?
---
Yeah, I was being sincere. The low achievement rate would mean it'd have very little impact on gemstore sales.
---
Classic ArenaNet.
---
Is it that hard to figure out that the upcoming trailer is for the upcoming real episode 1 that comes a month later(?) after the prologue we get next week and not about the prologue? So many people think the trailer is about the prologue...
---
While I understand a trailer aimed for new players, why would they want to wait 1 more week anyway ?
---
They are equally strong.
---
While lots of foci do look like they could work as fist weapons, others would not work at all.
---
What they could do is creating a new category of fist weapons, and use for its skins gloves from all armor classes that are thick enough and that cover the knucles, and foci that work as fist weapons because they cover the fist and protrude forward with something that looks sturdy enough to hit without breaking, like spikes, blades or bucklers.
---
Yeah but with catchup mechanics you can finish 9 months of content updates in a single weekend.
---
Makes the regular subscribers seem like a bunch of idiots.
---
but leaderboards are pointless whereas actual fractals are obviously liked by many
---
you can skip it in less than 40 sec.
---
I didn’t know this was a thing! I’ll definitely check on this to see if I can improve my DPS. 
---
Just an innocent question about rotation, as I do not quite understand what makes it so difficult in your eyes. 
---
Maybe it depends on the gameplay style, as I haven’t unlocked all the deadeye skill tree, but the rotation seems to be
---
Kneeling (5) &gt; Mark (F1) &gt; 3-4 times triple shot (3) &gt; Stolen ability (F2) + 5 stacks &gt; invisibility &gt; Empowered Auto (1) &gt; Same until new mark.
---
Add some autos with low on ability stacks.
---
Is there anything wrong here?
---
**Exactly!** With each release of Guild Wars, we got new professions. Those were what kept the game fresh. **New** ways to play the game!
---
In Guild Wars, when we *didn't* get a new xpac and got EotN, we still got new *skills* so that we at least had new ways to play our old characters! 
---
If we're not going to get new E-specs, we should at least get new trait lines or something to freshen up *how* we are playing the game.
---
&gt; Though I think they worked WITH A-net to do it.
---
Which is why I said that. So yeah, I did assume you guys had a green light to go with.
---
[Ever notice how Ausra look like sharks?](https://i.imgur.com/scpie3w.png)
---
I do CM+T4+Recs and get 30ish liquid gold+mats i don't sell (i buy 30 deeply discounted keys and sell spare encriptions).
---
I imagine 45+ is doable if you sell everything.

What if she was wrong.

Starting your journey to take down the Elder Dragons, huh?

If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.
---
I dunno. I've been to many metal concerts and they say cheesy shit like this all the time to loud cheers from the audience.
---
But not all achievements that give rewards or are "actual story content" would fit into the quest journal, because most of them are still normal achievements.
---
So either you would get a more than just "quests" in your quest journal -&gt; another unsorted mess or you would split rewardable achievements between quest journal and achievements -&gt; even more confusing.
---
Yeah, it's wearing a giant black poncho and space boots and wants to sell you funko pops and leggings.
---
Thank you for not asking what the hell I was talking about. 
---
I don't personally feel like a trailer today is super necessary after the build up that we have gotten. Hell we already have gotten a trailer for the prologue.
---
As a build with ridiculous modifiers like assassins signets active, you need to align your highest damage abilities with it + your other modifiers like your mark and malice stacks. Its like dragonhunter in that sense, but way harder to execute due to limited movement, tighter frame to squeeze your big hitters into... Etc. Also, no cleave
---
Glad to see I was doing it the « correct » way haha. 
---
I agree that kneeling puts you in a really awkward position, so learning the right positioning is the key to go in my opinion. I’ll make sure to watch for those alterations that impact the damage output.
---
This being said, (and it might be unrelated) but as I play a lot of league of legends and especially the marksman role (where positioning is basically 90% of the role), I find the deadeye’s gameplay similar to the marksman’s (DPS, squishy and fragile).  So I guess it’s ok
---
Confirming this. I’ll generally get back into a game about the same time a trailer drops for new content, even if it’s still a couple weeks out.
---
but what about a renegade with moot/shoshadoo swap dreamer
---
Yeah, sure, it's a demo. But I have no doubt OP would love to do the entire game, at least Prophecies.
---
Would it kill them to include a teaser / news bite *with* the announcement of yet more teasers?
---
I'm cool with there not being anything to share right now, but why do they always announce that they will be announcing announcements before an announcement
---
Chonk
---
Opps, wrong button. Yes, LS3.
---
Really depends on the look you're going for on your character. If you want to maintain edgelord status then Twilight is the obvious choice. If you're going for a golden look then probably Sunrise. If you want a blue/purple mystic look, Exordium.
---
They 👏🏻have 👏🏻nothing 👏🏻ready👏🏻
---
its just no one had the balls to do it before. meanwhile arenanet has the balls but no brains.
---
For like a few days since this isn't a full episode, it's a prologue and all they've shown about it so far is "it's a party with music and minigames".
---
As a charr-only player and a metalhead, a charr metal gig is by far the least possible thing I expected. Can't wait!

"If we confuse the current players into giving up in confusion and despair, it will create an excess of enthusiasm that will filter down to new players," said the Anet marketing alchemist in front of his alembic. "Then, we can confuse *those* players even more, creating a super-concentrated form of enthusiasm that will *guarantee* our financial security forever!"
---
These look like they'd make a very fun comic. I love them.
---
Depends, aesthetics aside how much gold and time do you have cause if you're starting from scratch Exordium is kind of a nightmare whereas Sunrise and Twilight are way more approachable. 
---
I mean really G2 legendaries are fantastic but after making Nevermore, Neveragain (well maybe) they're just huge huge sinks.
---
Core Ranger is really powerful: Longbow pew-pew may not kick as hard as it does for Soulbeast, but it's made up for by the incredible power of a Beastmastery-boosted pet. I recommend it for all my friends getting into PVP on core classes.
---
Arena net likes to do things last second and I've never really understood the reason. ..major updates or events are usually announced 1 or 2 weeks before they happen. I've just kinda gotten used to it.
---
i at least hope the full trailer releases before the patch hits and not after 🥳
---
Interesting ... wasn't expecting those modifiers to have that kind of effect
---
What's SD?

Technically it doesn't exist: [Link](https://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2012/03/09/science-explains-why-the-color-pink-doesnt-exist/) Hahaha

# Fundraiser Information
---
Pink Day in LA raises funds for the Canadian Cancer Society, which is a trusted and transparent organisation. We dedicate the funds to international research grants, which means the money goes directly into research, to countries all across the globe. As this is an international event, we wanted a goal that affects everyone, and advances in cancer research benefit everyone worldwide. The funds are via the CCS website and go directly to the organisation, and are not handled by us, or a 3rd party taking a cut.
---
You can find the fundraiser [here](http://convio.cancer.ca/goto/pinkday).
---
The reason for this choice is that CCS is a hugely transparent organisation with a global impact. We've developed a good relationship with them through the years, and in the past few years, they've always sent a representative to our live radio stream during the event, where they talk about where the money goes, how it's used, and answer other questions people might have on their mind.
---
Despite the fact that we use the color pink as a nod to how this event started (as a breast cancer event), our fundraiser is for all types of cancer, not just for breast cancer, and despite using pink ribbons, we aren't at all associated with the Susan G Komen foundation or the related pink ribbon campaign.
---
For more information, you can go to the [Canadian Cancer Society's website](http://www.cancer.ca/en/about-us/our-mission/?region=sk), where you can find information about their advocacy, funding, and more.
---
the second post of the thread is a short video of some concert though, guess that's it for this time
---
If you are a block by a hero point, can you get it via WvW hero point unlockers?
---
maybe they plan on releasing the trailer after the patch  launches? .. OMG WHAT HAVE I DONE!
---
Bard could take a page out of the FFXIV playbook and be Mesmer with a Shortbow. A Monk (not the GW1 kind, the Final Fantasy kind) would be difficult, and Blood Mage, Blue Mage or Summoner don't fit the lore. Nothing else springs to mind, but I'm sure there are others.
---
Don’t worry, it will be a trailer for a new line of plushies and other merch. We’ve already seen the trailer for the actual playable content.
---
Hmm, seems they're actually starting to block people who wonder why they're doing the trailer the same day as the release.
---
Most interesting.
---
uhm, no? read the magazine
---
We used to have the chance to get a trailer a WHOLE WEEK before a new release hits. Now we'll only know when things arrive when they are done, trailer included? Nice.
---
Of course it makes sense, it's anet
---
you read it again. It says:
---
&gt;The full Bound By Blood trailer will debut with the #GuildWars2 update next week.
---
Yes ... but those will unlock a random point so it might require a bunch of tries.
---
not our or anets problem you ignore 95% of the releases.
---
&gt; will defiantly look into it
---
Rather than submissively? :P
---
I actually use GS/Axe Mace sometimes for the extra CC. If using Axe/Axe, just use Axe Mastery instead of Burst Mastery.
---
Strength 3-2-1
---
Discipline 2-1 (3 if there are no banners)-3

Utilities I use are Blood Reckoning, Wild Blow, Signet of Fury, Bull's Charge/Kick, Headbutt
---
&gt; Stop downvoting me just to hate
---
Right now your post is only an hour old and at positive karma.  I know reddit shows fluctuating karma scores early on.  I just ignore them for 12-24 hours, when they tend to even out.
---
Maybe it's a trailer for the full saga no? What happens on the 17th is just a prologue. Likely not too heavy on the content at all. I expect it's actually pretty lackluster. Don't hype yourself up kid, you won't have anyone but yourself to blame.
---
Realistically, I bet it wasn’t finished in time for their internal policy and gating of releasing info.
---
As someone who will be at work when the trailer drops, I don’t have any issue since I can watch it then when I get home play it.  I can see it being frustrating for people who want to speculate the week before though.
---
But it's not ready yet
---
Also it will be composed of small teasers from this week glued together.
---
Really I hate teasers. Give us trailer forests and then you can give us extra info with teasers. Not the other way around.
---
Yes but they need content to make a trailer. If nothing is ready it's kinda hard to show it.
---
So thaat guy was from marketing? It explains everything.
---
Every core profession has merit except for maybe Mesmer and Elementalist. Even if it's just for a extra defensive traitline. A lot of them aren't meta, but they work fine in most levels of play.
---
True, my reply was under the assumption the user needs it for Tyria map completion, not just to finish off one zone.
---
Likely just left over code from something else.  
---
You've been able to select accessories in the wardrobe tab since the system came out but I highly doubt we're getting transmutable rings any time soon.  
---
Dyeable backpacks might have been possible years ago but I have a hard time seeing current year Anet going through all the trouble to be honest.
---
This isnt too strange for social media campaigns in general these days.
---
I mean, we've already heard a fair bit about the content in the prologue so we know it's ready.
---
I want staff or scepter Warrior. Something of a support spec to pair with Warhorn, since warhorn just keeps getting stronger and stronger every patch.
---
Okay fanboy, it is 100% anets problem.  Each story is roughly 2 hours max of new content unless I want to run around the zone looking at every pixel.  Then its 3 months wait.  I've been here since launch and play every single update there has been since day 1.  What he describes is not ignoring 95% of the releases.  Just accept this is really bad.
---
what is the alternative you recommend to zerk, and why
---
Feel free to enlighten me. Because the community (well parts of it, to be fair) does rage and scream about EVERYTHING, regardless of what is done or how it is done.
---
ah fuck off with your shitty fanboy blabla.... so tired of you morons. you dont like the content, that is certainly not 2h every 3 months, so its your problem. period. thousands of ppl think otherwise and just play. you idiots finally have to get in your head that content you dont like or dont care is still fucking content.
---
Clearly it's not meant for the existing playerbase, all anet cares about anymore is getting new players who are willing to pay, as opposed to filling in the content drought that older players who have already experienced most of the game are dealing with. This is obvious from their recent announcements which were also geared at new players. Who knows, it might work if they can swap out their playerbase which could help them buy time to create "actual" content, since the new players will still need to catch up.
---
This is the dark theme/feel we need for this next saga. Especially if they live up to their comment about it being eldritch horror like.
---
Sir lordkrall in his white, shiny armor has arrived yet again to save his poor damsel in distress ArenaNet from her own stupidity.
---
There sure is a lot of hype for this "saga" and it all seems very front loaded.  I wonder how much they aren't telling us or if this is just how they are going to do releases now.  I sure hope they aren't over-hyping 30 minutes worth of content every 2 months.  Either way, its all confusing.
---
Ugh. Fucking teasers. -.-
---
you mean that one who was filled with 50 % mediocre merchandise like those hideous leggings?
---
Yeah but doing 56 arbitrary collections, scavengers hunts and timegated bullshit is *content* /s
---
You know the theme ("big ass party" -Jason), know the map (Grothmar Valley or smth), you know the release date (next week).
---
Yeah, because the only thing that people remember are the last month or so, rather then the last several years and people's behavior?
---
You do realized by doing this that you miss out on all of the birthday gifts from those characters right?
---
The demo is only Lakeside County + Ascalon City + Ashford Abbey. Pre-Searing is the goal of the game.
---
&gt; My goal is to slowly flesh out pre-searing. And I will do that as long as I am able to. What comes after that? I don't know. Sounds fun to continue in post searing.
---

---
Doing all of Prophecies is probably cutting it far too close to legal issues anyways.
---
Story wise, HoT metas tells you the entire army side of the mordremoth assault, i always loved guiding new players through them telling them "this is the other side of the battle wit mordy from the story quests", it really feels massive and desperate, with a scrap army recruiting stuff and getting wathever we can to that final island minigame.
---
Good times
---
Explain to me how there is not more than 2 hours of content every 3 months when the only thing they come out with is the living story?  You freakin map complete the zone, you do the story, thats that.  Back to everything youve done for the past however long.  
---
The difference between you and the rest of us is people like you love repetition.  Where as all of us have beat this game to death and dont care for repetition.  Before you call somebody an idiot, check your self.
---
Because it's the Saga trailer, what we get next week is just a prologue. People are already acting like it's going to be a full episode, while actually it's most likely going to be five minutes of story content and a small map with a bunch of events and minigames and whatnot. I think they said it's also going to have the first strike mission, but I may remember that incorrectly.
---
So TL;DR whine tsunami inc for next tuesday while Anet releases the trailer for the actual episode.
---
Didn't they actually come out and cancel Fractal leaderboards and give an explaination as to why they cancelled the dev on those?
---
To me, PvE content should not be made to be competitive. Only would lead to more player discrimination based on Leaderboard rank and the like
---
When you can't play because bugs
---
My reservation with a single map expanded over time is that playing the same map over the whole season will at some point feel uninteresting if the content isn't delivered frequently and dynamically. Also, Anet's predisposition to push content every month will in the end be misleading if they are counting on the same events we've had for the last years like Halloween, Christmas and whatnot. People want **new stuff to do**, not the same recycled content we get every year.  
---
I'm generally optimistic with the new season but I do think they need to do a better job when communicating what they've been working on.
---
Didn't we see a trailer in the announcement event?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cSD2aXhfCIE
---
And this Twitter?
---
https://twitter.com/GuildWars2/status/1168914251660038151
---
We already seen trailer at 30th. What's the point?
---
Trashnet wants zero hype. They only want disappointment at this point.
---
they may told us much but in the end we still have close to zero info about gw2 short or long term future
---
It's literally just a vague hint aka the good ol' "it's on the table". It means nothing, and especially not if it's from Anet.
---
Assnet will always be trash.
---
they also confirmed they work on WvW alliances and "its coming in the next months"
---
except  that they say this for over 2 years already...
---
[Boo!](https://i.imgur.com/69KS37T.jpg)
---
To be fair, the last time they tried to generate hype it blew up in their face big-time. I imagine their marketing team is nervous.
---
Great! Can't wait for next teaser!
---
Sand Diego
---
Team size doesn't necessarily mean as much as you'd think in a development workflow. A smaller, but more focused team can usually get their work done faster. The key here is that while they get done faster, they also don't necessarily get as many large content/features done in that time span. Might explain the more iterative maps (which I'm for anyway).
---
We'll have to wait and see.
---
its funny how people bash other mmo's for kill ten rants quests, but if anet does it over achievements its suddenly lots of content.
---
These trailers are already designed to draw people back in that have stopped playing regularly since the last episode. A week is a long time on the internet, the chance that people might forget about the update is actually quite high. By releasing the trailer on the day the episode drops the chance to forget is way lower, they probably are gonna try the same thing as when a new game is announced and right after the announcement you can download it. The existing player base and the people that follow the game on Reddit and other platforms already know about the announcement anyway, there isn't much of a point to remind us that this is coming. 
---
Would I like a trailer this week? Yes! Do I understand what they are trying to do? Yes!
---
That's exactly the point.
---
I hope you still was able to read the important part.
---
&gt; give some players the motivation to get excited about it
---
lol
---
I'm in the process of levelling a mesmer, and it feels pretty satisfying to me.  Sword 4 -&gt; Sword 2 hits hard.
---
Please enlighten me about the new stuff that was *teased* in this trailer that I wasn't aware of and why it would hype me up for the coming episode?
---
I want 1 handed spear on warrior
---
Great Jagras
---
We've gotten two trailers in the last two weeks.
---
Nothing weird at all with them doing an actual launch-day push.
---
It definitely is not.
---
I'm pretty sure the way they are approaching this is basically releasing parts of the trailer, section by section, until next Tuesday, when they will make the full trailer available as a single video.
---
Which is stupid...but, it saves them time and effort of creating more teaser things, by just creating one single trailer, and using sections of it as a teaser.
---
This sub has always been bizarrely upset that marketing isn't aimed directly at them, the people who have already paid for and actively play the game.
---
As a player of one of the best magic setings on tabletop rpg(mage: the ascension) the answer is easy: all magic users get their powers from raw magic energy, but humans minds dont understand how it really work and need some sort of proxy to interact with it, spell users use that, ritualized spells, to call upon magic energy  "divine" magic users use their faith and prayers as a proxy to call upon the magic. In a few works if they belief that joko granted powers as gods "do" they have powers
---
The a main thing of the episode seems to be the concert, and thus showing that would surely make total sense?
---
but you suggested that teasers are supposed to have new information that we dont know already.
---
Teasers arent supposed to give out new information, they are supposed to tease you in order to get you to try the content yourself and find out.
---
You tell us the reason why this gaming company would decide something as stupid as releasing a trailer the very day their big Prologue releases instead of releasing it now to create discussion and hype.
---
Yeah how dare them try to add some flavor and cultural aspects to a race when they finally get some screen time, right? /s
---
White knight for shit wars 2? The game that never delivers and ALWAYS dissapoints? Id rather fucking kill my self with a spoon.
---
True but 3 years of no new content would be a death sentence even if there is new specs.
---
You didn't provide evidence, why should I?
---
Also cinematic.  They are showcasing and teasing elements of the patch, but we dont know what they are..  
---
New activity?, New adventure?,Charr concert?  
---
Its easy if they put text based images like they did in LS4 trailers.  
---
"New history based saga"  
---
"New "expandable" map"- "Charr homelands"/ Grothmar Valley   
---
"New mastery"..  
---
"Rework of something bla bla".  
---
"Big world Tour of Metal Legion"  
---
"New challenging content "Pve Strikes".
---
We are just getting the Prequel next week, I assume the trailer will be for the full release?
---
.....because you're the one saying I'm wrong.
---
its funny how ppl praise other moos for the same shit anet does and anet gets shit on for it. a DLC in eso has not more content than the living world, and wow updates are mainly for intanced content only, so everyone not into that is screwed.
---
*Controlled* shininess.
---
Legendaries were *weapons.* There were also very few armour pieces that had a glow to them.
---
You were very limited to what equipment slots you could apply this shininess to, and Legendaries were also hard work and well earned.
---
It's completely out of control now, and has been for a very, very long time. You can whip up the credit card and get items in the store that outshines legendaries by a longshot, and it doesn't only stop there. There's infusions, glides, and mounts too.
---
Guild Wars had a really good theme, and Guild Wars 2 followed in those footsteps, *until* they started to screw the theme of the game over with *this* we see here.
---
I think focusing marketing on the START of the mew content might be the only rationale I can see the logic of. If you throw up a trailer now, then people come in expecting that content right away (because people are generally idiots and won't read that its coming in a week). I still don't think it's a smart idea, but I can maybe see what they're going for.
---
She makes me proud.
---
Did you actually watch the full announcement for the "prologue?" It announced build templates, a watered down raid, and.... Merch... That was it. Nothing else. Don't throw on that white knight armor and try to defend Anet. Many of the people upset about all of this are veterans who have hundreds of not thousands of hours invested in this game that has no clear direction of where it wants to go or what it plans to deliver. If you think the content or lack thereof is awesome then that is fine but don't go hating on others who clearly have valid reasons to call Anet out.
---
I can't speak for the raiding side of the game, but the activities I usually do (metas, bounties, fractals) are also busy as they normally are. Meaning in game I don't see the overall pessimism that's present on reddit.
---
Gw2toolkit is a very useful app if you prefer not having to tab in and out, think its only for android but its very useful for tracking item progress, trading post prices etc
---
Inquest Sword Mk2 is even better
---
That is one of the biggest turn-offs for me. The fact that they punish new and returning players like this. Anet has sadly never been very good at promoting their game.
---
Nice, really nice little pice of art. I like your style.
---
$$$$
---
Get a routine. Fractals. Dailies. PvP. Doesn't matter, but you're gonna need a shitload of gold and mats. Don't sell materials, just deposit them and forget them.
---
But that's the point, it's not at all a believable piece of Charr culture, based on their lore from GW1 and GW2. It seems like they're just doing something gimmicky to attract people.
---
Yeah, I forgot that culture doesn't change at all after 250 years and that in no way can develop any artists at all.
---
I did a map complete up there last week and it was fine though, try different instances?
---
There might be a fix you can do, like with the cursed shore bugged meta you can fix by taking a champ over
---
It isn't only about single player story instances with a little co-op on top.
---
Expansions and new gameplay features are the lifeblood of an MMO, we haven't had any single of those in 2 years already.
---
wait, so anet going with "we want to be different then other mmos" but doing the same shit should be praised? aaah makes sense!  
---
...not even the furry band is a original idea. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
This is amazing and I love this idea so much
---
Eita, um comentário em português XD
---
Obrigado!!!
---
Thank you!
---
But how do you expect to get upvoted if not by shitting on the game or its company?!
---
He gave a theory, You just said "Nope" and that's it.
---
Shhh. Don't bother the kids while they're farming their upvotes. Gemstore bad! Fuck paying for development.
---
Urg, exposed :c
---
I just wiki’d Pharus and went through each of the components and craft them one after another.
---
I see Skychonk, I upvote.
---
As enchanting as ever
---
Its not from my testings. The time you spend casting bolas could be used for another f1. You can always precast it but you can also do that with mending.
---
The auto stunbreak from str 1 is also quite nice on some bosses and blood reckoning wins out in longer fights. Haven't tested outrage but if it wins in longer fights wouldn't it be used in raids aswell?
---
Hey, you're the one being way triggered now, and it's relatively easy to spot.
---
This is not the first time this complaint has come up, and in fact, it has come up many, many times. As you probably have noticed, it's certainly an issue that *many* people voice up about.
---
But also the fact that you think characters glow "a little" shows that you don't really have a sense of a game's integrity, and all your raging posts here is to justify all the time and currency you have put into looking like an obnoxious lighthouse.
---
It's all well and dandy, because after all, Guild Wars 2 is doing *really well* now isn't it. Issue after issue stacked on top of each other.
---
And this is certainly *one* of them, a big elephant in the room. Give players the option to appear as obnoxious as they can for real life cash.
---
Get a [converter](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Converter) and change the materials into items. Honestly though you’ll want some refined dust and ore later so it might be worth trying to craft it now. If you do delete it it’s not too hard to get a bunch more though so no big deal either way.
---
I'll tell you my thoughts.  This is purely subjective, since everyone prefers different things.
---
I was about 70% of the way towards completing Sunrise when Exordium was announced.  
---
I don't like Sunrise/Twilight all that much. The hilt/guard is kind of cool, but the weapon is a bit silly looking.  
---
But that said, it was the only Legendary GS available at the time, and my main is a Power DPS Guardian and I love love love GS on my Guardian.  So I held my nose and started collecting.
---
When Exordium was announced though, I stopped collecting, and was waiting to see what it would look like.  If I liked it, I would have sold Dawn (the precursor) to get money for the missing mats and craft the Gen 2.5 sword instead.
---
But then it was released and I was able to see it in action, and I lose interest in it completely.  Why?
---
Was it the colour?  Nope.  A bit too Mesmer, but not as bad as say Dragonsblood weapons?
---
Was it the model?  Nope.  It was sleek and elegant?
---
Was it because it changed shape?  In fact, yes, that was my problem with it!
---
When that feature came out, I thought it was very cool that it changed shape for specific attacks.  What I didn't know at the time though, was that it changed shape for pretty much every attack.
---
On my Guardian, my GS 2 would look like a great axe, my GS 3 would look like a hammer, and my GS 5 would also look like an axe (iirc).  And that was my problem.  
---
When I use GS2 I want to see my GREATSWORD spinning around, not a great axe.  Same with the other attacks.
---
If the model change for Exordium was a random proc or something, I probably would have crafted it.  But the fact that I would never see a sword spinning around when I use GS 2 on my Guard, it turned me right off.
---
I've since grown very fond of Sunrise, and don't regret my choice at all.
---
The weapon is cool, just didn't hit the right notes for me.  YMMV.
---
My guess is that after the impressions from the live event marketing re-evaluated the content of the trailer and decided it needed changes.
---
They may have scrapped the entire original trailer. Creating trailers does take time. Even a 30 second spot can take weeks of man hours.
---
This comes from experience and a little deja vue. A game I worked on a couple years ago had a live reveal at a trade show with a trailer meant to drop on Twitter and YouTube a week later.
---
After evaluating the social media response to the reveal, marketing decided that what they originally wanted to emphasize in their content did not align with fan expectations or address reveal criticisms. So the ENTIRE thing was scrapped and a new one was produced that went in a totally different direction. That pushed the trailer drop date back by two weeks.
---
This feels an awfully lot like that. This metal legion clip was likely supposed to be the date and time of original trailer but that got pushed so this was posted with the new trailer date attached.
---
I know that many predators rarely use Discord or Telegram (even though there are plenty of people that did and got caught). I don't understand what you're trying to imply with " of course you wont notice anything, if you just use it a little for harmless things noone cares about..." so what are the things that would get you banned apart from breaking the rules or posting illegal stuff? You are saying that they monitor ALL our conversations but I think it's silly. Of course they can review stuff that get posted on the channels, it's on their servers, but I really doubt that they hire tons of people to listen to our conversations, especially since so many people (me included) don't even speak english when they use discord.  
---
And the information that they would gather is... which games I play and how many times I swear playing League of Legends... lol.
---
I switched to Marauder's about two months ago. The DPS drop is enough to notice but I no longer have to don my Nomad set for grindy fights.
---
Everyone trying to avoid looking at the cat shitting on top of that shelf
---
[Single Thread Performance](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html) is the best benchmark I've found for running GW2.  
---
Your current i5 4440 scored 1880.  
---
The Ryzen 5 2600 scored a 2,006.
---
The top-end right now is ~3,000.
---
You probably wouldn't see a huge performance boost with that CPU.
---
I'd recommend saving up a little more and getting an Ryzen 5 3600 if you like AMD.  Just be sure to pair it with at least 2666MHz RAM.
---
Exactly my thoughts. Somebody realised on weekend they should probably release a trailer for this but they have nothing ready, and the whole thing looks like buying time to make any trailer-like cinematic. Can't wait to see the quality of it.
---
strike missions aside and some rough specification on where the story is going, we knew about literally everything mentioned in the entire announcement since april. [source](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/whats-next-for-guild-wars-2/)
---
Waiting is content
---
i think you need to fix your flair. :)
---
...what? Do you not watch trailers for movies that you're contemplating watching? What does their release date matter? I just watched the trailer for My Cousin Vinny and it sold me on watching the full thing.
---
Found it, dis one.

Do not waste coin in the trading post for cooking. Cooking is the cheapest and fastest discipline to max, even to 500.  
---
I maxed 3 characters to level 500, and I barely even used 0.5% the the materials I had casually gathered from while completing maps and daily gatherer achievements. I didn't even have to follow guides.  
---
Just made cooking ingredients and sauces as they became available, and discovered stuff with them.   
---
[Most cooking ingredients are gathered easily or bought with karma.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ingredient)

Animals that drop meat and poultry like warthogs and moas are easy to kill and often appears in herds, allowing you to kill them in groups of 3 and 5, or even larger. You can kill 20 wolves and not get a claw or a fang, but it's very rare to kill at least 5 without getting 1 or 2 slabs of red meat.    
---
For butter and chocolate, what you want is killing bandits, pirates and skritt.  They drop loot bags and those loot bags will often have those.  And lots of events involving pirates, bandits and skritt will often spawn waves of enemies that drop loot.   
---
And there's lots of [node farms](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Node_farm) with large amounts of materials you can easily obtain in little time.    
---
Once you hit 425, it'll be a bit more expensive because of the collections, and you will also need to have an armor discipline maxed to 500 to make a heat stone, learned from Dry Top.
---
We've already had two trailers and that digital magazine pushing the next release.

Adding to that a launch day trailer that can end with "Login and play right now!" is a pretty sensible marketing push.
---
Really? They've been pretty good to their word in my experience, I remember being surprised after they said they had suspended legendary weapons indefinitely and we all thought that was developer talk for legendary weapons are cancelled then they started releasing them again out of the blue.
---
I really doubt ArenaNet is done with raids, they definitely won't be coming out at the pace that people want but that's just how it is with an MMO that's barely mainstream. It's a dying market.
---
Windows 7 was recently made compatible with DirectX12.  This could've had an impact on how well Win7 runs GW2.
---
Good news is the [D912pxy addon](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cyg9vy/d912pxy_dx12_for_gw2_now_v17/) was recently updated to support Win7.  For most players it helps even out framerates, but it really depends on your hardware configuration.  Doesn't hurt to try.
---
If your bank space is limited make curios a few at a time.
---
It is not the best crafting discipline (imho) to support a character, food is still cheap. If you want to level up a character with cooking is ok (you get some character level for a little cost). Better if you raise a discipline to craft ascended Weapons and/or armor if you want to commit to the game (fractal or raid or wvw).
---
Which now can no longer be unseen...
---
I wish I had a skyscale

Newsflash: I don't care if you - or anyone else - believe me or not.
---
Start doing metas in HOT/POF for the map currency need 500 of each I believe,and amalgamated gemstones (need 250)Do daily ley line for mystic coin takes like 5-10 mins. Your 30th day log in reward should be the 7 clovers.  If you have laurels and don’t have any use for them use laurels to t6. Bitterfrost frontier is good for berries to buy t6 packs from the magic vendor. You’re also gonna need to buy the recipes for gift of blood,claw,venom etc eventually so hoard a lot of gold. Make sure you have huntsman maxes for the precursor. Just do a fuck ton of research cause there’s more steps than what’s listed on the wiki
---
Damn that looks great!

Like I’ve been saying, it’s heavily dependent on how you manage your loot. I make a point of aiming to maximize profits. I even stated in another comment that if you’re keeping some things or you’re not using he TP wisely, that number can end up being a lot lower.
---
I don't do a lot of sword, but I do staff a lot. I actually go Earth, Arcane and Weaver.

This is just what I use, you can obviously improve on it. I generally go with this just because I'm used to it, so my rotations are always spot on.
---
I'm on NA so it's pretty dead
---
Someone's never been to a concert
---
I guess it depends on what the timeframe they want to make it in. Because the gen 2 are all gold based, I recommend picking the extra Laurels for T6/4/3 materials for gifts or T6 -&gt; TP for mithril and elder.
---
DX9 isn't exactly the problem. Yes, the game doesn't make use out of multiple threads, but that's entirely based on how the engine was designed, not a limitation of DX9.
---
lol they already failed multiple times on preventing backlash. It's best for development to have player feedback before an update release. Not two weeks it's about to be released though.
---
Where's your proof that I am lying? You are just assuming I am lying. And we all know what assuming does.
---
It was not a comment. It was an interaction. One pvp guy shouted out, when they were talking about upcoming pvp armor set, then they pointed and laughed at him. They then commented about the 'one pvp guy' in the audience. It is the whole entire interaction not just the comment that was disturbing.
---
exordium is better for afking and if it matches your char, but it's not spectacular when drawn/fighting
---
eternity is still the best one

how did you answer the original question at all?
---
There are real life human cultures less believable than this
---
this isn't a episode though, it's just a prologue.
---
The third gen AMD CPUs have much better single threaded performance than previous gens, nearly matching Intel's ST performance while costing significantly less. Overall value is definitely better with AMD at the moment. 
---
One small correction, the base speed for 3rd gen Ryzen is actually 3200 MHz RAM, which you can find 16GB kits for around $70 last time I looked. 
---
For GPU, you can very easily get away with a AMD Radeon 590 (roughly $200) or a Nvidia GTX 1660 (roughly $300) depending on what brand you prefer or what monitor you have.
---
Once you get the computer built, make sure you download and install the d12pxy addon for Guild Wars 2, which will GREATLY increase the smoothness and overall effectiveness of your new hardware.
---
you didn't answer mine either, I asked how a particular thing could be fun, IE I find fun condition engineer because it involves using a wide array of kits that have different functions.
---
Make 400 shards of (off hand weapon)
---
You’ll save a lot of gold
---
i9 and even i7 is a complete waste of money for GW2.
---
Get the i5 9600K with a decent cooler and OC it and you have almost the same performance as far as GW2 goes.
---
They didn’t lie.  A full blown dx12 implementation is vastly different than this mod.  I’m still of the belief that they should go to dx12 but when they’ve essentially put all of their calls on the main thread then you’re going to have decreased performance elsewhere.
---
The cost benefit on them going to dx12 isn’t worth it at this stage.  Though we are fortunate enough to have people in the community who want to push the boundaries of this game for the better.

Eh..no, it doesn't..
---
What? So you are basically saying that when a user makes a DX12 mod it can enhance performance, but when ANet implements this mod into the base game, it wouldn't?
---
Excuse me, but that is some next level bullshit whiteknighting..
---
I wish Soulbeast actually morphed you into something a little different rather than just a green light trail thing. Like for Revenant, the Legendary Demon Stance turns you into this purple, fiery demon and it’s badass.

Won’t we all be downloading chart when new charr-centric story content is released?

Give us reason not to bash the game :)))

hi new
---
&gt; It isn't only about single player story instances with a little co-op on top.
---
Nobody ever said that.
---
&gt; Expansions and new gameplay features are the lifeblood of an MMO, we haven't had any single of those in 2 years already.

Ehmm... yes we did...

Uh, didn't we all technically download a charr? Isn't that how we can now play as charr?
---
Lmao I said the same thing when I saw that picture of the lizard. I, too, use chonky.
---
It's a slower death than nothing for 3 years at least.
---
Well where’s the proof your not lying? If this map really had a bunch of players who stopped 8in the middle of a fight to comfort players, someone had to have taken a screenshot, and there must be someone who can confirm your story, yet there isn’t. You also leave out a lot of details, like what map this was in... the less detail you give the more it sounds made up. And I don’t think it’s realistic that everyone stopped doing this bounty to comfort someone... it’s just not realistic. So yea, you heard the term innocent till proven guilty? I’m gonna assume the claim is false till proven true...
---
&gt; Really? They've been pretty good to their word in my experience  
---
like 3 raids a year and fractal leaderboards?  
---
&gt; I remember being surprised after they said they had suspended legendary weapons indefinitely and we all thought that was developer talk for legendary weapons are cancelled then they started releasing them again out of the blue.

because you can't sell a product with clear definitions and then bail on it. i bet someone in the US would have sued them like mad.

&gt; It's a dying market.

you meant dying company if they can't make enought money to hold their employees and associated projects.

Can I feed it Charged Quartz to get around the timegate?

poor content poor support  
---
His point is out of all the choices from the chest of loyalty, the clover choice is worth the most in gold if you're in need of clovers in the first place. Since they're not actually tradeable any excess aren't useful so it's best to make clovers when you're close to finishing but before you buy t6s for gifts.
---
You can farm the first map of HoT. For 500 airship parts and maybe 1g you can buy a gear box (head, gloves, etc.) where you can choose all stats.
---
Crystal Desert Reward Track in WvW/PvP?

Thanks, the answers above solved my problem :)
---
Thanks :)
---
Thank u :)
---
&lt;3 opencommunity
---
So I am guilty until proven innocent?
---
Yeah...fuck off.
---
You get the airship parts from doing the events and opening the boxes that lay around (the crowbars you get from the events too)
---
Yea, I know that. Just didn’t know that there is an Armor with full chooseable stats :)
---
you wouldn't buy one either....well, except if you are a furry ofc, but that is just weird.
---
I mean, FFXIV teasers often contain new info or hints of new stuff........why can't GW2 do that?
---
i wouldn't download a charr due to my self-preservation instinct
---
I have been playing fractals for nearly a year and CMs + t4s for about 3 months. I have Fractal Savant at this point. So my sample size is fairly large. Normally you'd find experienced players in the morning or afternoon, but now groups are rare. If you don't do them at reset or even before, you're pretty screwed.  After that people just do their normal dailies and log off until reset hits again.
---
Having something like Launch Trailer is actually pretty common.
---
this new minion elite looks nifty
---
\^ this. People who have trouble taking criticism tend to do this. Don't down-vote someone for stating the truth, especially since they're saying it nicely.
---
&gt; "Paying for development" that's a laugh.
---
Let's keep that one, shall we?
---
Well, summarizing what pirates do (raid, pillage, steal, murder, etc.) kinda defeats 4, 5 and 6 :D
---
To be fair, raids are already extremely easy compared to some of the bigger competition in the MMO market, so it makes since that strike missions aren't going to be that hard.
---
Eh, there are Nightmare Sylvari who do bad stuff and aren't Soundless. While I don't see any reason why pirate sylvari can't be Soundless, I'm not sure a Sylvari needs to be Soundless to be a nasty bastard.
---
Honey, raiders want more than fractals. They want.........ya know.......raids.
---
Ah, but such is often the way of roleplayers and lore nerds, that we try to explain what the original content creators didn't think about, while probably really thinking too hard about it.
---
Not that it's gonna stop me.
---
I could see a sylvari fitting pretty well in a crew if that wrew were, like, a cross between Robin Hood's merry men, and pirates.
---
Or maybe they're soundless, yep.
---
I'm inclined to agree with rude\_asura.
---
Teaser (Definition): a short introductory advertisement for a product, especially one that does not mention the name of the thing being advertised.
---
Soundless should not be confused with Nightmare Court, as they are completely different things. Soundless just want to free themselves from the Pale Tree's and The Dream's grip, while the Nightmare Court seeks to destroy them both.
---
Apologies for the unrelated and noob question but how does he get that dial-style menu for his mounts? I just started PoF and have never seen it before.
---
I think it depends more on the interpretation of the teachings from each individual sylvari. Arguably, looking at the tenets of Ventari's Tablet, none of them really are completely rejected by the life of a pirate:
---
1. **Live life well and fully, and waste nothing.** Nothing about a pirate's life is inherently wasteful - quite the opposite, if the trasures they plunder would go unused otherwise.
---
2. **Do not fear difficulty. Hard ground makes stronger roots.** One could say that the challenge and hardship of a life at see and being a pirate does lead to many types of growth and greater strength. This teaching is just saying "don't let tough times get you down."
---
3. **The only lasting peace is the peace within your own soul.** I've always taken this to mean something along the lines of - "The world is always going to have its difficulties and it's never going to be perfect, so do what makes you happy." Maybe being a pirate makes someone happy?
---
4. **All things have a right to grow. The blossom is brother to the weed.** This one could possibly go against a life of piracy, but only if the sylvari is actively harming those who are blatantly innocent - not just if they are acting in self defense.
---
5. **Never leave a wrong to ripen into evil or sorrow.** Like tenet 4, this will come down to the exact sorts of piracy a person engages in. But, let's also not forget that most who do bad things are not "evil" - to their perception, they are doing the right thing, perhaps to support themself or their family.
---
6. **Act with wisdom, but act.** Nothing inherently contradictory to the pirate lifestyle here - you want to act smartly, sure, but take advantage of the opportunities presented to you, like in the last tenet...
---
7. **From the smallest blade of grass to the largest mountain, where life goes—so, too, should you.** If life leads you to a life of piracy, then maybe it's okay to follow. Same as if life leads you to be a scholar, a warrior, or even a lonely drunkard in the back of the local tavern.
---
Honestly, I don't think anything on the tablet outright states that piracy is a horrible profession. I'm sure *most* sylvari will see some issues with the lifestyle, sure, but most of the teachings on the tablet are put more in place to prevent acts that are actually *evil*, the type of things blatantly associated with Nightmare corruption, a sort of evil one can never recover from.
---
We have both CPU/RAM setups you mentioned, the 4440 is paired with a gtx960 4gb, and the 2600 is with a gtx1660. Both run gw2 a lot.
---
The amd one does run better, can have more models. FPS is not that good either one.
---
I would not consider upgrading for GW2 only. It's horribly optimized. 
---
The 2600 is a very good CPU otherwise, runs new games with pretty graphs.
---
That's kind of where I am honestly, like it's free and the content will take two hours tops, I might as well knock it out before I log back into FFXIV/do literally anything else.
---
Well there was another part of your message I had to address cuz I don’t really like it when people take me out of context. I also don’t like liars. So yea I’ll fuck off so you can enjoy your 150 free upvotes.
---
Eh...I know. I'm just saying that you don't have to be Soundless to be a bastard. Nightmare Court isn't made up of Soundless and are worse than pirates.
---
&gt; Uncalled for and far from reality

And that, my friend, is how one can convince a Sylvari to be a pirate (As long as they're naive enough to believe it).

Spvp legendary back piece!

Easy legendary to get.

Do you want random people on internet to decide how you should spend thousands of golds?
---
I was looking in to the rollerbeatle but the chapter is locked and anet decides to do that chapter I have to buy it...
---
you can do all that again on my account, thanks!
---
Since when the heck does withholding information mean the person is wrong?
---
Have you been to LS 3 maps in NA? Ember Bay usually has 2-3 people on average even at or around reset-time.
---
The simple reasons why? And there are even more advance reasons, but I want to be short.
---
1. There are too many maps.
---
2. There is no gold farming in these maps.
---
3. Casuals only visit the map every now and then just to do daily hearts. 
---
4. There are so few people in these maps that event rotations can not even be done anymore even if the map/event design is well made.
---
It never did, nor do i imply that it does. There's a reason the two statements are in different paragraphs, as they are two totally separate thoughts.
---
OH MY GOD I'M CUTE
---
You are the one said "Who wants to run around being a glass cannon in zerker gear all the time? "
---
I explained why I and others are perfectly fine doing that. Because nothing in the game particularly punishes the decision. Anything that hits hard or knockdown spams you will do that regardless of your equipment.
---
I would
---
Before opening, seeing only preview, I thought it is Diablo cosplay \^\^ :)
---
Can’t take a joke like you serious ❤️
---
Advantage of Fractals (even sub-T4) and Raids is they give you ascended gear as rewards on top of the gold.
---
Wrong.  Gift of Battle Reward track has some clovers.  Don't want to make extras.  Spend your monthly on clovers, depending on how many months it takes you, that'll cut down on some clover cost.  Also fractals could ease the cost somewhat, if you get into those whilst gathering your gold.
---
Thanks
---
matreshka teasers haha
---
I've wondered before if that difficulty was conscious on the part of the Tree, like she was trying to ensure the soundless were well-protected from Mordremoth through training mental fortitude, even if she couldn't use the Dream to protect them.
---
It's a theory I like, but ANet's writers never seemed to care enough about the worldbuilding to actually hint at stuff like that, even in un-voiced dialogue. The story became character-focused to the detriment of literally everything else, and those characters being focused on didn't even include the player, who was written as a generic blob because race-specific or choice-based stories were too hard for the skeleton crew they left behind to work on now cancelled projects.
---
The idea that there have been major revisions and retconning has occurred to me, and I hate retconning. It's always felt like someone taking a story that is already famous or popular, fanfic'ing it, and trying to claim it as canon. I did hate how the Gods were brushed off in POF. I bought the story in GW1 when you are visited by the Gods in the Realm of Torment, and they claim they left Tyria physically after the war with Abaddon, but I hated the whole "And we are abandoning Tyria because we can't stop the Dragons"
---
if someone plays mender scrapper the same way as demo war that's on them, not the build's fault
---
what exactly is selfish about insane boon spam, condi conversion, projectile mitigation, amazing revive potential?
---
it was very similar to the more aggro versions of firebrand
---
Coding what, exactly? Outside of damage values all the mechanics will have been done for a while. All the animations will have been set and synced. All the dialogue will be loaded in. What remains for them to do the night before?
---
These people are not idiots or amateurs in a garage.

How do you check what the rarest item on your account is with gw2effiency? I hear about people doing this (and also just checking which items are the rarest in the game), but I can't see anything like that when I've gone through the site.
---
You saw showed nothing suggesting anything of this stuff is finished. Lack of trailer today only enforces the feeling nothing is ready yet
---
New elite specs twice in 7 years. New gemstore stuff every 2 weeks. Do not think that Anet consider you as core audience. Sry this is reality. My need to try new builds now fulfilled with Path of Exile every 3 month on a schedule.
---
Sylvari do not have to be nightmare or soundless to stop following the teachings of the tablets.   
---
As sylvari players were are not constantly hearing the pale tree's voice in our heads.  
---
The Pale Tree offers a connection to the dream and a defense against Mordremoth mind powers, but she's not controlling sylvari as if they were dragon minions. 
---
Think of it as still having a conscience, but not listening to it.
---
Meta or at least very good core classes for every gamemode:
---
Raids/Fractals: Warrior, Guardian, Engi for Raids
---
Wvw: Ele, Guardian (as a stability bot and dps, not support healer)
---
PvP: Thief, Warrior, Guardian, Ele
---
Piracy is the wrong term, since the original data does not get taken away...
---
I watched both trailers, read the magazine, the interview, and looked at the calendar. You're ranting on reddit because you're annoyed we didn't get a third trailer. 
---
Hell, a trailer takes time to edit so even if they started today then all footage of ready to play content that you assume a trailer is proof of would still be from the dev build done today.
---
Advantage of Dragonfall is, that you gather Volatile Magic and Mistborn Motes, which you can trade for cheap ascended accessory with freely selectable stats.
---
Also VM can be traded for the cheapest Obsidian Shards, which you need a lot of for ascended crafting.
---
Silverwastes drops Obsidian Shards directly though and you can buy additional ones for bandit crests.
---
The length of time it takes to craft a leg/precursor is entirely dependent on you, and time-gated materials (if you don't have enough before you start).  Get a gw2efficiency account, add your API key, and you can look up any precursor/legendary and see the material list.  It'll also show you what you already have, and what you need to get, including collection achievement items.  It definitely uses resources, and may cost gold.  Depending on which one you're going for, it'll require that different crafting disciplines be maxed out, but the majority of the mats required are the same for all of them.
---
You mean other than the freezy raid thing, halloween rollerbeetle race, the return of old halloween events, and more? Yeah, sounds like the exact same shit to me. /s
---
this is wrong
---
the best way to know is copypasting the build THEN reading the damn skill/trait/whatever text and understand why it is the way it is
---
people making their own snowflake builds will find them "good enough" in open world braindead stuff then be shocked when everyone in the raid squad comments on it
---
moreover, they will get used to playing a subpar build instead of doing the right stuff from the beginining
---
nobody is advocating for mindlessly copying meta builds, but it is the lesser evil of the 2
---
The nightmare court doesn't listen to the pale tree.
---
Yo dawg, we heard you liked teasers...
---
&gt; neither of us elaborated.
---
He literally did, He said the trailer is delayed because he thinks it's not ready.
---
You said "Nope that's not why."
---
Sure, it's always a matter of personal taste. There are also people who  don't like i.e. Halloween, for them it won't be exciting at all. But there are also many people who like Halloween (and other festivals) and not only because of the labyrinth (or JP) farm. No matter if you look at the start, mid or end of the festival, all activities always are well populated.
---
250 gems for the trailer segment choice contract.

Put your nostalgia glasses down and look again. While all Pyre can do is turn around like a robot and move it's jaw up and down like a hand puppet you can see that Bangar is moving every single muscle.

It would never stop posting. There are so many of them.

Fashion. Honestly, that's the biggest endgame. Unlocking all the skins you need.
---
Hah, up until a few years ago charr player characters couldn't even "turn around like a robot" in idle pose (to face the camera direction while right mouse button is held), while all other races could. Having never played anything but charr back then, I didn't even know that feature existed.
---
But the comparison is flawed regardless. GW1 shot was an in-game in-engine cutscene, while the GW2 shot will most likely be a prerendered video file.
---
Yes, I am surprised most people do not 'see' what they did to the gods in PoF. The gods were already hiding in the mists. There was no logic in removing them from the entire plot other than to visit them briefly and 'kill them off'. The writing is so bad for this game unfortunately. 
---
I really enjoyed the bloodstone and gods plot line for GW1. GW2 is all about the dragons which are still extremely blurry plot wise.
---
Lettuce investigate.
---
Does it seem a bit nutty?
---
The other day I was looking at my wardrobe for my Sylvari and was disappointed I couldn't give him 2 peg legs.
---
Having a pet parrot on a Sylvari shoulder seems more natural than any other race.
---
Fucking siiiick!
---
If OP is willing to wait 11 months to get all 77 sure... otherwise gambling once in a while to reduce it could help.
