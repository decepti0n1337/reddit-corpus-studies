its like asking if i got my bestfriends girlfriend pregnant. i will only know once its out.

70 is the hard number of character slots without needing to have the maximum number of character slots before purchasing the Deluxe or Ultimate edition of Heart of Thorns. 
---

---
I got to 70 character slots after getting HoT.
---
I would recommend Anydesk.
---
It's a remote desktop app.
---
Pros:
---
 
---
Free.
---
No need to pair devices before usage. Just note down each computer's unique ID and remember your password. When i need to log in, I just get someone at home to switch on my computer and we're good to go.
---
Very clean interface. 
---
Lag is minimal for me. Audio + visual. I stream downloaded movies from my desktop onto my phone. 
---
Available on android. Never tried but you can definitely collect dalies with my phone / access bltc.
---
Yep. The wife and I just hit 32 slots each. We're going to "try" to avoid making anything more than key Farmers until the next living story is announced in case it effects character creation at all like PoF did but it's so easy to make more after playing so long. 
---
How about they rename one of the junk items found in Elonian reward tracks to "Mighty Teapot"?
---
The true Endgame. I need them all to look dope.
---
69 + 2 hidden beta char slots
---
Finally.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Because they tried to inject a bit of impartiality in a "GW2 is a special unique game" circle jerk. But FFXIV is probably even more static than something like WoW. They try to put some movement in with most of the melee classes with positional attacks (rear or flank), but it doesn't do much to change up the old-school gameplay. I love both games equally, but for very different reasons.
---
Yeah I mainly roam and play sPvP. Coming around to dwarf and hammer for large groups though.
---
No, but there's always next March :&gt;
---
100% agreed, and done the same search. Closest wad black desert online. Now if you wanna play single player game , try darksouls remasterd, incredibly satisfying game. 
---
&gt;No, it just doesn't have the same meaning in Tyria as it does on Earth.
---
I'm not talking about that, I'm talking about characters either returning and acting like their deaths weren't a problem like Glint, Snaff, or Eir, and then you've got characters that are brought in just to die like Demmi and Blish.
---
&gt;A) "planned deus ex machina" is an oxymoron - if it's set up previously in the story, it's not a Deus Ex Machina.
---
You're right, I used the wrong term, I meant contrived. Joko was deliberately brought in to give Aurene an easy way out.
---
&gt;The bad guys don't need to be done justice. They're bad guys. Justice is what is done to them. Making them into a laughingstock or a dragon meal is doing justice to them.
---
I meant in terms of being written, Joko has been a great and well developed character since gw1 and it was shame that he got so little time but I can understand why Anet needed to get him out of the way to move the story along.
---

You have to select one of the rewards on the left side of that list, then it will let you move on.
---
You only get one Auric weapon, not all three, per time through.
---
Bought No 26, 27 and 28 today. Maybe i buy 3 more tomorrow
---
Or just not do any of that thank you. 
---
Must resists, wait for 5 shared inventory slots....
---
Warclaw legit killed ganking more like it. People who want to roam will dismount and fight, those who don't want to roam and just want to get back to their group wont dismount and try to ignore you, which isn't a bad thing.
---
I guess there might be a few less "dank wvw roaming" montages because gankers aren't going to be able to one-shot or 1vX lower rank players on their way to their zerg.
---
It's definitely that FX that's bottlenecking you. Those have notoriously low single core performance, which games developed in the late 2000s/early 2010s value more than anything else.
---
Making the jump to ryzen or one of the latest gen Intel chips will be huge. The unfortunate part is that to make that upgrade, you'll need a new motherboard, CPU, *and* entirely new RAM, since the sockets for Ryzen/modern Intel are on boards that require DDR4 ram.
---
now i feel stupid not to have seen this
---
it literally tells you what to do.
---
The stairs were always there. Always. Before the beetle races they were underground. But since they moved the wall we can now see them. They’re not a new addition 
---
You are the one not able to deal with it. We are lla just fine with it. We all do well in Fotm farming every day. If you get a bad combinations in Fotm then you can always try a diferent class. Nobody is forcing you to keep playing just with one. Try to use your brain from time to time and you will find a workaround for everything mate. 
---
The FX CPU, Socket AM3(+) motherboard, and DDR3 memory are much older than the nvidia 10 series graphics hardware. 10 series isn't ancient by any standard.
---
Check the screenshot in the linked post.
---
Saves ~6g at the cost of other materials, good option if you don't have/want to do a collection weapon.
---
so... not to come across as too dickish, but how were you able to unlock the jackal, and yet have issues following simple written instructions right there on your screen?
---
This topic has been discussed to death. You missed the stairs in your screenshot. Other posts did include them. No, this is not something new
---
Same. This was a game changer for me in Wvw. Good FPS in 3way fights...a dream has come true. 
---
Super Adventure Box is likely coming on the [26th of March](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/countdown/) and in recent years has ran for [about 20 days](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Super_Adventure_Box) which means that Super Adventure Box will likely end around mid to late April. 
---
With this in mind we must also consider the possibility of the recent layoffs having an impact on the cadence. Who really knows about this? Nobody, that's who.
---
I'm going to predict that Episode 6 will release (if there aren't any delays) one or two weeks after Super Adventure Box ends: 23rd / 30th of April. 
---
Haha. One of these things is not like the others! That said, the shovel Knight cosplay armor is SOoo good. I've been tempted to make a set and I don't even play Shovel Knight. After 28 characters I've definitely started to get some more... Referential, names as well tbh though. Fawksy Cleopatra and George Cloney for example, aren't super lore crazy, lol. Great character family though!
---
I tried BDO but the on ethink that irks me is the constant dodging and moving. I feel like that o ly gives it the "illusion" of being active and makes combay more disorienting than it needs to be. The closest thing we have to that is Daredevil but I still think it's smooth enough to enjoy, especially with the option to enjoy Teleportation camera off.
---
Of course, I hadn't really subj enough time to give a fair opinion on BDO, but that's how I've felt ever since
---
Silverwastes is the only real repeatable one, pretty much everything else is daily like istan now.
---
once again the fact that people can so easily rush through chokes and defences with mounts is not adressed. It is very simple to get through say 5 people holding gates or such places with mounts.
---
Thats one Option, however i disagree About the confusing part - after all, youre blindly thrown into the PS too.

---
Then have NPCs on the map explain other Details. Ist not that hard really - and if something is unavoidably exclusive to one race theres the Option to just make the dialogue character-bound afterall

It is okay bud, at least you didn't take a screenshot with your phone

Here's my charr spellbreaker Varus Sunderfury 
---
 https://imgur.com/gallery/TbiCqbv
---
That depends on whether he just killed Aurene or consumed her too.  
---
She wasn't branded (which would have made her not dead) and she still had a corpse, so she/her magic wasn't necessarily absorbed.  
---
That can be contradicted by the fact that Joko's magic was unbound before he was bodily eaten.  
---
The apparitions could have been similar to Balth's Sword still searching for him and reacting rather poorly as we tried to feed it to Kralk... Whatever parts of those souls remained intact after being consumed could have manifested their hatred at the one who killed them (us) and given Kralk some extra "oomph" on the attack.
---
I name all my Sylvari Irish names. Turns out lots of them aren't taken, especially once you create some form of last name.
---
(Queque fancy introduction collage while reading)
---
This is an insane amount of consideration!  Thanks!  While I'm mulling over all this, my immediate questions relate to the Mesmer.  Why Scepter for leveling?  Scepter/OH on both weapon swaps?
---
Also, why is Chrono so hard?  That is the spec I was originally going to adopt simply because it's always in demand from what I've heard.  I'm going to have to reread this post many times lol.
---
You are neither the first nor will you be the last ...
---
Whoa.  That's literally a game changer.  $36 bucks isn't bad at ALL.  Man...  I almost have to do that.
---
There is a possibility that the pieces of the souls of those entities were powerful enough and Kralk was able to call upon their rage and hatred for having been killed by us to increase the power of the attack.  
---
Or it's showing the anger of the beings above but moreso showing that emotional pieces of said beings can manifest themselves within the dragon... One who just ate a friendly and caring dragon that also happened to be mentally connected to us... AKA we might find ourselves gaining access to Kralk's mind via some piece of Aurene that he was goaded into consuming?  
---
No that is not the case by a long shot. In roaming there are 3 things you normally do which are killing people, duelling people and taking smaller objectives like camps and sentry points. In order of fun I put duels as first, then killing people and then taking camps. Since duels come about once every 6 hours of roaming if that, ultra rare and other people who like roaming/dueling are just as rare. Taking camps is boring and braindead so you may as well zerg at that point. In the end the core part of roaming is killing the loose people/groups. As a good roamer you sometimes even look at groups of 4 and take them on (really fun btw). Zerglings like you won't complain about these mounts however because it lets you escape the 1v1s that take actual brain cells and ruin the roaming for people who want it. I stand by my point that the ONLY people who like mounts are people who run with the tag constantly and in groups of 15+.
---
&gt;If you're willing to keep the mesmer, a   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;lot  
---
&gt; of people play greatsword mesmers for ranged combat and enjoy them, too. Using a greatsword to shoot lasers? Very cool! I personally don't enjoy the playstyle of the greatsword though -- it feels slow and clunky to me. If you get the expansion you can also go condi mirage and just use staff/staff. Slap an energy sigil on both staffs to give yourself more dodges and then it's just max range murder while your clones take a lot of the damage for you and you dodge all day.. I have a staff/staff condi mesmer that I use for soloing difficult champions, dungeons, and fractals if I'm bored, and between staying at range and spamming dodges (mirage cloak), it almost never dies, even with the recent nerfs. Personally I find axe mirage more fun, but staff is certainly safer.
---
I'll look into this.  I always thought endgame groups only wanted Chronos.  Thank you for this large post.  I've got a lot of rereading to do!
---
They can sell more dance or other emote animations unique to professions, gender etc. 
---
&gt;Oh dont be afraid to be trash
---
My Mesmer's name is literally "Trust Me Im Trash"

Sweet, good to know that :)
---
Just don't make the the mistake of buying Mystic Stones to forge kits.   It's 10x more expensive that just converting those gems to gold and buying Master's kits.
---
&gt; Sorry, I am a bit busy with real life problems, so I cannot answer quickly.
---
No need to be sorry, it's a game - real life has priority.   
---
And thank you for the information.
---
You are a zergling who couldn't care less about what is a roamer and what is a ganker. Roamers want 1v1s gankers want to run with 5 people and take out a single dude or just gank a 1v1. Killing you while you run back to the zerg is an element of this gamemode and the only element that forced you to use any amount of brainpower. Anet wants roaming dead and so does every little idiot zergling like you
---
Yeah, some research beforehand could have saved a lot. FX is one of the weakest flagship CPU lines of all time, high end Phenoms (the AMD processor line immediately before FX) actually outperform the FX line in single-thread applications. I used one of the high end FX when they were new, and while it was better for multi-tasking it definitely made my gw2 experience worse coming from my old Phenom chip.
---
I know the theory is pretty old, but putting the image to it also offers some other possibilities.  
---
For example, these are 3 super powerful beings we had very direct contact with.  We traded taunts with Balth, we invaded Mordremoth's mind very directly, and we had multiple contacts with Zhaitan through every one of his minions, even some very powerful ones liek the Eyes and Mouths.  
---
What if instead of directly channeling these entities, the pieces Kralk consumed awoke inside the dragon directed their hatred at us, via Kralk?  It's in a similar vein as Balth's magical sword looking for him.  
---
If a powerful enough soul can arise within the dragon of it's own will, then we have a very direct connection to one that just found its way in.  
---
I still think it's easier to just have Aurene do the Joko thing but I figured posting the image of something often referenced couldn't hurt.  Definitely should have used a different title/format. :/
---
I didn’t realize people struggled with this achievement... I’ll just be in the corner here counting my blessings.
---
So you have a problem if you are running back to the zerg and you get attacked by a roamer 1v1 but you have no issue if you are with your 20 man zerg and run over 1 or 2 roamers. Good to see that the zerglings are still at it
---
Action cam is not innately gw2. Feature came with the big update after the HoT fiasco.
---
The action cam were used in many games starting with Aion, Tera, BnS, BDO.. in the western release the was Wildstar.. Skyrim and ESO, Shooter games..
---
Again MMO is a dying genre. Many devs are delusional.
---
But keep in mind characters in gw1 have to have a surname. So you couldn't reserve single names
---
The economy in this game is revolting.
---
SWTOR was my first MMO and I was a very, very hardcore PvPer in that game. 
---
I have taken several breaks over the years, usually when I get enthralled in GW2's living story or making a Legendary or something like that, but whenever I go back and play SWTOR PvP I always say to myself, "this is incredible why did I ever stop?"
---
I originally started GW2 because I had some real life friends who had quit SWTOR and picked it up (they lasted far, far less time in GW2 than they did in SWTOR). During the pre-release build up I was really excited to try the PvP, I used to mess around with theorycrafting builds before it was out, I went into the preview hours to pre-plan my character so I could get in ASAP on early release day. Unfortunately, when I got into the PvP I just found it absolutely terrible. I've tried it repeatedly over the years, but never find it much fun or worthwhile. I do enjoy roaming in WvW, for whatever reason, and that's how I get my PvP in with GW2. For the most part, though, GW2 is my PvE game and SWTOR is my PvP game.  
---
&gt;I've said it before and here it is again:  I expect Aurene to pull a Joko and summon some aspect of him or his magics to return to us.
---
You and about 70% of the community.
---
However, I disagree, because unlike Balthazar, Mordremoth, and Zhaitan, Joko is neither god nor elder dragon, he is not some powerful being connected to some domain of magic.
---
Here's merely a lich, a powerful necromancer, just one of many in the series. He's an interesting character, but he's not some cosmic entity like the other three were.
---
Besides, Aurene consumed Zhaitan's magic too, through Mordremoth. So she already had a sizable amount of death magic in her, which was all Joko really used.
---
Dafuq did I just watch?
---
A scrapper gettin' laid.
---
I just can't stand the controls. Heck, when I started MMOs in 2012 I was totally a keyboard turner and I was pretty darn good with it. I played with high level PvPers in SWTOR and people didn't notice - I earned my way into my server's top Republic PvP guild doing it -  but after a year or two I managed to gradually teach myself to mouse turn. My point is that I am not some total purest who can't understand keyboard movement at all, but still... I just can't stand it in ESO.
---
He drinking bear which triggers knockdown at 25 stacks. In same time Kinetic Stabilizers dont have interal cooldown and activates every time player interact with that keg.

What's there to change? it's true

I have women of all races, only missing Indian cuz the face isn't available.. and makeup

I don't need more alts... I don't need more alts...
---
i played when it dropped the sub, servers were shit (literally over a minute delay at times)
---
gave it another try a few months later; enjoyed it; got to cap, which was painful because the dungeon queues took hours
---
steam release was whilst i was actively playing; servers half as shitty as f2p release
---
shortly after game shut down
---
and dont get me wrong; wildstar did a lot of things amazingly (housing and wardrobe), but it did about the same amount of things fucking poorly (attacks not matching up to hitboxes, reliquary competing systems)
---
Insane toxic levels and attitude... Mine shring all sources of this Insane level you speak of...
---
There is no use for those ram if I change my Mother board? So if so there are gonna become paper holders?
---
Mighty Teapot xD
---
I'm stunning myself, so I'm getting stability. Then breaking it by drinking again. Repeat.
---
Really? Yeah let’s shame somebody for purchasing something and keeping the game online. 
---
Get off your horse. 
---
Yes gemstore updates. The only endgame content nowadays. 
---
You are just mad he called you a bad player for  getting less than 10k dps at dhuum before the first unavoidable soulsplit.
---
Joko didn't even have powers of resurrection. Best we can tell, it was magic which forcibly bound his soul to his body - same as Khilbron, Fendi Nin, and The Hunter. Arguably, they never "died" (thus "immortal"), while Aurene certainly did.
---
What in the various religion's gods made yu think what I commented had anything to do with zergs.
---
It's from a roamer's standpoint that I'm speaking from. 
---
10k dps LUL
---
&gt; he was mine, until that one throwaway line about aurene being the 'grandaughter of an elder dragon after all'... so fucking stupid and out of character (hes mordies 'grandson' too)
---
You speak as if he is wrong.   
---
Aurene looks "fine" and cute from our characters' viewpoint because your character is a complete and utter monster by our own standards of morality. Try to pull off some of the shit we've done in story and you'll quickly find out that you are the villain of this tale.   
---
Well, if you want a use for your old motherboard, CPU, and RAM... You can just grab a case, hard drive, and a cheap gfx card and you've got a great media center PC. With 32gb you could do a home server as well. But yeah, upgrading motherboard/cpu sucks because of the attached cost involved.
---
ESO feels better as a single player game to me, but I don't play it as an MMO and I don't think the combat is nearly as clean as Guild Wars 2. Even jumping in ESO, I feel floaty like I have no weight, or I'm on the moon.
---
I know I'm late but they added DX12 prob before you made that post even. It's like 150fps at 4k in raids. 
---
Neverwinter is a PWI (Perfect World International) game. The cash shop and/or grind is probably pretty heavy I would think.  That keeps me away from most PWI games.
---
TERA combat is relatively close to Guild Wars 2 combat, but nothing else is even close. It has a linear story that is as generic as you can get. It's not, to me anyway, anywhere near the same.
---
TSW is a much better game for me, but the combat is not nearly as clean and doesn't feel the same or even close.
---
Good times, I remember when the precurser weapons were like, 10-20g as well.
---
Meta events were a blast in HoT, but referring to my last post, the story was all that seemed interesting to me in PoF is all. But yeah, I understand where you're coming from, but the things I like in an mmo just aren't the focus here. I still hop on to do the LW chapters and what not cause the game has an incredible story line, but the vertical progressions is exactly what I like and it's not so vertical here. To each their own though, right?
---
but the whole plot is about ending the cycle of dragons eating all the magic, and not delay it once again
---
Magic has to be stored in something that wont try to kill everyone
---
But you what spec I’ve wanted to try...
---
*Nine new alts later 
---
Wildstars aesthetic just looked awful to me. Imo guild wars 2 has the best overall look to the game than any mmo out there. 
---
Some mmo's look too realistic and some look too cartoonish. Guild wars sits comfortably right in the center and the art style and graphics just work so well. 
---
Bug or feature?
---
You act as if it's special to be ascalonian. There are plenty of them ingame, and Siege Master Dulfy is just a random mini boss halfway a fractal. 
---
I feel like every time I join a world boss squad, I always get screwed by not being in the same instance of the map. Is there a trick to joining the same map instance?
---
I've got Bill Gates, engineer, and was actually my second character I created after playing for 15 minutes.
---
Definitely feature. 
---
You make 1k gold a day?!
---
You can right click on any party/squad member and join their instance if you're in the same map.
---
It's full of players, full of content, and fun as hell. It's my go-to game ATM. Having a blast in it. 
---
Best bug is still Petey.
---
Now all I need is an Edge of the Mists map with people can Unrelenting Force each others

---
It was a series of bugs.
---
First I as my normal human character glitched atop the Warclaw as sometimes happens with mounts; standing with frozen animations.
---
I couldn't fix that despite waypointing, attempting to unmount/mount and it slowed me down and was messing up combat obviously.
---
I eventually thought maybe using a transformation would fix it and so I hit my beloved random quaggan generator and...
---
Turned in to a tiny Quaggan size Warclaw, rider invisible.
---
It wasn't until I then hit one of the costume brawl attacks that Quaggan appeared riding her noble steed!
---
(I did post on imgur a series of screenshots through all this and of some of my adventures as tiny Warclaw and Sir Quaggan. But it got majorly downvoted and I deleted the post in insecurity...) I can post more here if people want!
---
SSD wouldn't help because it's the CPU fault. I have GW2 on SSD, it helps with loading, but I still have some invisible stuff.
---
I did try to see if I could be a Skritt Knight but the only Skritt tonic I had was the Burglar and it just didn't work.
---
You kill Kralkatorrik and the screen fades to black. "The Elder Scrolls V" "Skyrim".
---
That's the rollerbeetle mount's name. 
---
Oh yes! I thought maybe I'd missed some meme...
---
Try Blade And Soul.. You will fall on love with Gw2 in due tine again xd
---
That's awesome 
---
Dragon hunter of course
---
Guardian already has shouts
---
Came here expecting a bunch of nonsense, ranting and very creative/crazy theory crafting...but you actually make a lot of sense...gg
---
M E T A
---
Played two games of PvP but lagged horribly a few times, disconnected once. 
---
DDO is a great action-oriented combat MMO.  The graphics are a bit dated nowadays, but the build-crafting is insane.
---
Depending where you are it can be significant. In LA I went from mid 30s to mid 50s (3570k 4.6GHz / 1060 6GB / 16GB RAM / SSD). Still can be a bit buggy at times (crashes), but if you really need performance can't hurt to try.
---
Agreed, I was pretty disappointed when Dhuum came back only to be via raids.
---
The dragonborn would definitely use the skill labeled shouts
---
Same. I tried it maybe twice and decided I didn't care about getting only 1 AP that much.
---

I think the new runecrafters kit might be a better buy. Depends on your split of green and blue/white gear.

Tfw trying to unlock Elite spec but got caught by an Imperial ambush.

And credit my my guildleader Sierra Nox for taking the video :)

That might be a good use of my Tomes from WvW. How long does just the personal story part take?
---
So lame you cant use tonics like ascalon mage on the warclaw.

I had accidentally deleted my authenticator app on my phone, and I contacted support and they got it removed. Had to provide details like account name "example.1234" and a serial code from a purchased portion of the game, original or expansion

Fellow amd fx brother!! Try linux os :P m running gw2 via lutris wine-staging 3.15 version with pba and esync on and with thread optimitizaton on it uses all my cores = no massive frame drops. I am getting 50+ fps with medium settings(low character settings) in Pve except during meta ofc. I had the same issues on windows you just describe.  
---
AMD FX 6300, 4 GB RAM, GTX 660.  Try it on a virtual machine.

This [settings is what i am using currently for gw2](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/9fkp8p/guild_wars_2_on_linux_with_winestaging_pba_esync/)
---
Was more disappointing that he was in a on-shot, short, and poorly made raid than the fact he was in a raid.
---
TBH, it makes sense he was in a raid. Raids are GW2's version of GW1's elite missions, which is what The Underworld was.
---
Its not 6 guys only 3 have names.

I tried the checking the wiki, but I couldn't find anything, so apologies in advance if this information is out there.

Copperfed Salvage is such an improvement on QoL. You wont know how much you needed it until you use it.

Not to me, thanks to this post i have meet many people that will help me, thanks anyway for your contribution.

There will be a public scrutiny, when the guide to make it will be ready, thanks to the help of people who comes to help me instead of wasting time writing useless things on reddit.
---
Have fun.
---
Yeah, but you can do way more than that, we estimated we can do at least more 15 gold from a single run, making the run last around 7-10 mins less than now. 
---
If you would like to know more about it, come talk with me :)
---
To explain it in a public post, would require to have things that people can understand easily.  
---
I'm working on it.

Feel free to think wathever you want. The new method is already active and just waiting for more people to help it out.
---
Hello guys, to post it here in reddit surrounded by evils, would require some accuracy. It's a big work to be done and I working on it.

If you want an explanation, come in game or add me on discord \[@WTF#0820\].

I will love to explain to you directly.

Feel free to think wathever you want, I didn't named the farm, and I don't care about what you just said.
---
That bloody heart is turned really chilling.
---
Not at all. Just say in general terms what the changes are. You don't need to specify timings or routes or anything.
---
You don't need to post a full guide to explain a change. The entirety of riba can be explained in about six sentences, but it needs a proper guide for people to actually do it properly and get good gold from it.
---
Stop hiding from criticism and just say what you are changing.
---
There is no way to make the defence phase go faster without completing more events. A normal riba run should be completing all veteran and dolyak events.
---
The other events on the map are not gold efficient for the time they take.
---
So, based on this, I'm gonna say that your method is focused on getting the veteran and dolyak events completed and you're comparing to a riba run where people don't know what to do and dolyak/veteran events are failing, not to a properly executed riba where those events complete properly.
---
Any tips for an idiot that just started playing the game and has little experience with MMOs? 
---
As far as mesmer goes, it really depends on its traits to best offer damage. Greatsword, Mantra of Pain, and your Phantasms are your workhorses, but I'm not a mesmer main. Its biggest condition is not as useful in PvE as confusion procs extra damage on skill use which NPCs don't really spam the way players do. Mesmer honestly has one of the higher skill floors, and even an overhaul really didn't lower it much. That said, it has an incredible amount of damage mitigation, but in this game that comes through active blocks and evades.
---
From what you've said above, you should absolutely be giving necro a real shot. One of the beefiest classes in this game with the largest healthpool baseline. Its core mechanic is a second health bar filled with energy from those that die around you. Tough, tanky, offers range and point blank options, you can summon minions if you like or concentrate on corrupting Boons (buffs) into conditions or just stacking conditions.
---
Core necro has a decent Minion Master ranged build to work off of when leveling.
---
Final thoughts, scrap the Guard (rip), try out necro, keep a hold of the most useful class in game until you have a better grasp of game mechanics.
---
Can you please link the source where Anet said they are not making any more expansions? 
---
Lots of great new player guides out there (I have a couple linked on my page) like [this guide](https://rkoturdo-ndo.github.io/GW2-Tutorial/) or /u/Gulbasaur's [guide here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Gulbasaur/Things_I_Wish_Someone_Told_Me_-_A_new_player_guide) the subredit also has it's own [page here with more guides and options.](https://old.reddit.com/r/guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). Were you looking for advice on anything specific because you should be fine just jumping in and having fun. Explore a lot, don't worry about completing "hearts" (the sort of area quests), and just get a feel for all your skills and controls. Oh and learn to dodge with the evade key!
---
I dont zerg you moron.
---
100% agree here, the leveling, professions, and just screwing around are more than fun enough for a decent amount of time, the world is beautiful and massive. Combat is challenging and there are a ton of things to explore. At the endgame though, rng progression and endlessly grinding is what it's mostly made of, and I cant think of anything that looks halfway decent outside of the cash shop (where skins are $30 or so).
---
To be honest, if ele gets a longbow at some point, i will freak out in joy.
---
Londbow ele is something i wished since HOT.
---
Ele really needs another two-handed weapon. Its the only class that has only one!
---
Shooting elemental magic from a longbow simply makes so much sense!
---

---
What a weird way to find more people. If you'd just tell what to do an organized a map announced here, you'd instantly have all the "more people" you want to "help it out".
---
Wrong
---
[Probably my favorite character aesthetically.](https://i.imgur.com/CpbI12t.jpg)
---
Some can be bought again like [sentient singularity](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Sentient_Singularity) but the collection or achievement ones like [princess](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Princess) you'd need to contact support to get again as far as I'm aware
---
it's 1am , i am tired xD
---
and the jackal ... the longest is to reach lv3 on the flying thing
---
Based on that perspective, Kralk’s eye is way WAY bigger than a player. You could take the top of that head and make it into an entire 3 mode pvp map easily. 
---
TOO SOON
---
Okay but listen though. What if we actually had a map that was JUST primordus’ body?
---
Yeah that lag is sooo much fun
---
Unless you do have mystic stones you got for free, then it's cheaper to use mystic kits than silver salvage-o-magic.
---
Yes.
---
How long will it last?
---
Laughed my ass off. So true. 
---
Jumping in 100CM makes Slippery slope a joke. The only fight it really seems to affect for me is the first one where your jump height isn't as big. 
---
try p912pxy addon for gw2. https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/releases
---
makes more uses of gpu and less cpu.
---
My bet GW2 will repeat GW1 with last expansion and another LS to wrap up in 2022 and then tons of dowb time to devleop GW3.
---
A 2.5 to 3 month release cadence is a promise from the past. Only one of the five living world season four maps has taken under four months.
---
Maybe it's because Primordus was battling the Sixth Elder Dragons over power dispute, and we managed to get more information about the Sixth. Wouldn't that be cool? 
---
They most likely just began development on the next expansion after the layoffs, I doubt they were beforehand because pretty much all of the devs they had working on the game were probably focused on pushing out LW content. I'm personally hoping they make a gw3 instead of an expansion though, but if that was what got canned during the layoffs, well then that ain't looking too good.
---
i would prefer a hammer for elementalist. image a vast amount of elemental skills inline with hammer5 from the revenant.
---
magmahammer
---
lightninghammer
---
air pressure hammer
---
hammer of rock (thats my favourite)
---
&gt;We also know that a pseudo expansion 3 was being worked on in the background before it became season 5,
---
We do?
---
Since i already have found the help I was looking for thanks to this post, I am shutting it down so you all go give your 2 cents somewhere else :)
---
&gt;they can only put out a raid every ~8 months
---
So they are faster now? Nice.
---
Plot twist, you **are** your brain.
---
I can see a hammer working as well, but ele really lacks another ranged weapon. But if they made hammer ranged like it is on revenant that would be an option.
---
Anyone else facing problems with gem purchase? I tried with two different cards but just moved on to first window without any confirmation or gem update.
---
It’s actually the least fun.
---
80 person queue to only join and eat skill lag and 8 FPS.
---
Really nice video! I have one question, what is your opinion on the new Harbringer Shroud, wouldn't it be nice addition to power Scourge bomb? I guess sycing it would be clunky with the 3s countdown, but it is also a source of 10 man barrier.
---
Yeah my bad, I meant to say Backstab, the dagger stealth autoattack, not Heartseeker. Maybe now it will make more sense ? 
---
If you think about it these 2 hour story pieces and 1 map are taking way long than 4 months since they have at least 2 teams, maybe 3, rotating to deliver episodes.
---
Unless they gutted that too last year... 
---
*laughs/cries in engineer*
---
First - do the Personal Story when it pops up. It's the game's single-player campaign (though you can bring other people in with you) and it's a fairly good transition if you're used to single-player games. It starts at level 10, and is then every 10 levels. 
---
MMOs generally have a very different pace to single player games. It's more like going to a theme park than watching a film - there are lots of things to do and sometimes that can be a bit bewildering. You choose what you do, largely. Heart quests are little local mini-games, some of which are basically "kill X mobs or click Y things" but some are much more inventive. Events (indicated by orange on the map) are a little story scenario that plays out, often connected to a heart quest. 
---
GW2 also has "meta events", where different things cycle through often leading to a giant battle. They're usually indicated by an orange text box on the right of the screen, or by orange markers on the map. They're more common in higher level maps (the ones in Orr and Heart of Thorns are great), but it's not uncommon for one event to lead to another and that's kind of neat. . 
---
Mostly, just play and see what's what. Guild Wars 2 is a fairly forgiving first MMO. 
---
I really recommend joining an active guild at some stage (/r/guildrecruitment might help you). A good guild is kind of a ready-made group of people who can hop in and help you when you get stuck and lots of them do organised activities together. 
---
Welcome!
---
Got caught trying to cross the border to Cantha, wast sent to be executed in another world.  
---
Thanks reality-shattering Kralk!
---
no way i'd say i hate women.. hahah
---
To be faaaaaaiirrrr....
---
Ok, now let's focus on the really important part: Are cat ears now more meta on human females than aviator sunglasses? Haven't played in a while and don't want to be behind the trends.
---
Nah, fuck the new SA. It's the most annoying right after birds. I cannot stand having other players move me. Like today had someone knock me off the scaffolds in Aetherblade while I had just casted mimic to blink up and it legit wasted my mimic CD and I didn't get to solo the top floor like I had planned to. It didn't ruin the run of course but it is absolutely annoying as hell to deal with.
---
Hilarious the first time. 3rd? 4th? fuck that, I want it gone already.
---
When we learned that other projects took enough of a priority over GW2 to lead to released like Kourna and whatever the fuck happened to the Moon Fortress meta.
---
Thats why i think longbow would be best. Out of all the two-handed ranged weapons, longbow does feel like it would fit best.
---
They don't compare, monk is for group sustain, defender is for personal. Don't think that anyone runs durability anymore since there's no need to.
---
Well, until they show people otherwise the only thing people can really look forward to are SAB and more microtransactions.  It's not surprising to see people frustrated or exhausted given the layoffs and the recent living story cliffhanger.  Unfortunately, GW2 is in a precarious spot amongst its player-base and the game seems defined by uncertainty more than anything else.  
---
And also [this](http://extrafabulouscomics.com/comic/450/).
---
Write a bug report .
---
They can do a soft reset then - make all owned objectives t0 and SM neutral. It's one of the big reasons why reset is more fun than the rest of the week.
---
Stand on tag pls.
---
It’s also bugged so it doesn’t do what it says.
---
To add to your list:
---
* Birthday Gifts. They're boring at first then you can flesh out your dye collection. You will also end up with an army of Jennahs.
---
* Completing the new living world map nets you a decent amount of currency and they can usually be done in an hour or less. Plus the chance of a key in the process.
---
* Some classes are better suited for story achievements than others.
---
* Multiple Gifts of Exploration if you want to make legendaries.
---
* Can unlock the newest elite specs immediately.
---
* To get the PoF backpack achievements you need 3 characters.
---
* Farming runs.
---
* Bag opener.
---
* Key farmer.
---
* Keys from the 10 (once a week), 40, 60 personal story; Into the Labyrinth LWS2; Chapter 11 HoT.
---
* A degree of anonymity unless someone knows all your alts, has you added as a friend, or is in the same guild.
---
* Confusing people if you're hopping between multiple alts.
---
* Geodes from map completing Dry Top.
---
* If a balance patch utterly messes with your main, you have backups.
---
* Somewhere to dump accountbound items you don't want to delete so they don't clog up your bank.
---
That said, there's no reason to kit out alts in full ascended gear unless you want to. Exotics are just fine unless you're doing T4 fractals or min-maxing raids/WvW. You don't even need to do the story on every character. GW2 is very alt friendly and how much gold, time, and effort you puts into them is entirely up to you. Plenty of people dump their alts on a farm and call it a day when they're not using that alt for anything else because it's a quick and easy way to get some mats and/or gold.
---
I loved the game, but hated the design decision to create a questhub grinder. I can't do questhub grinders anymore. I've done questhub grinders for 10+ year of WoW-dominated MMO development.
---
For what it's worth, I thought, back then, during the beta, that Wildstar was indeed the better WoW.
---
Sadly, hardcore gamers are nothing you should rely on to carry your game.
---
I wonder if they will cahrge for living world 5 if it is offering expansion level features.
---
Personally I wouldn't pay for the living world story, even if it was cheap. If elite specs are included I would probably pay.
---
Some quaggans are very dangerous :D   
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ayuzlf/quaggans\_tamed\_the\_war\_kitty/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ayuzlf/quaggans_tamed_the_war_kitty/) 
---
Aurene also absorbed Balthazar's, Mordremoth's, and Zhaitan's magic, but she shows no sign of knowing what Balthazar, Mordremoth, or Zhaitan knew. Similarly, it took quite some time for Kralkatorrik to learn how to use the abilities he got from Balthazar (and, it seems, from Z and M too).
---
Not to mention that Mordremoth and Primordus utilized Zhaitan's domain in a completely different manner as Zhaitan (Mordremoth using it to become capable of creating clones from corpses - because that makes sense somehow - while Primordus used it to give his destroyers some poisoning capabilities).
---
So, how I see it, it seems that the Elder Dragons (and Aurene) aren't absorbing their actual spells or knowledge of spells, but the ability to access those domains.
---
One comparison could be like when you pick a secondary profession in gw1 - you got access to the attributes, but not to the skills yet. Or to put in more generally: As if a necromancer was suddenly able to use mesmer magic, but didn't know how to best utilize it or how to cast mesmer spells until learning how to over time.
---
Lichdom is just a specific form necromancy. All Aurene should have gotten was death magic, same as from Zhaitan.
---
Personally speaking, I doubt that Joko will become relevant again. In the AMAs and whatnot, ArenaNet devs made it pretty apparent that they felt that they had to go through his story quickly. Adding his death to Ogden's lines about prophecies was no doubt just a means to excuse why the hell he never shared that knowledge with us before - it would have been damn helpful to know that the Elder Dragons needed replacements before we killed the first, let alone second, one at all. Claiming he kept silent because "the prophecy said not to tell anyone until these signs which you just so happened to fulfill" is just a throwaway method to explain this massive retroactive idiotball handling.
---
And as to the Mists thing: I can't see us spending a lot of time in the Mists, tbh, especially not the majority of a season. Mostly because ArenaNet devs stated they'll never make an open world PvE map that isn't in the world map - so no maps taking place within The Mists. This means for every episode we don't solve the Kralkatorrik issue and take a trip into the Mists for it to bring Aurene back, we have to make up some excuse to go to some new zone that tangentially ties in with our trips into the Mists. Because of that, I do think we'll be ending this plot with Episode 6.
---
And it should be noted that while Kralkatorrik was ransacking the Domain of the Lost before the battle, nothing really suggests that is where he went after escaping back into the Mists after the battle. Given that the spirits were attacking back, he'd likely go somewhere to recover first, so somewhere he has a much stronger hold on in the Mists than the front lines of his forces.
---
That's a rather silly mentality. They've already repeatedly stated that the LW will continue as planned. We know we'll be getting Episode 6, and we know we'll be getting Season 5. If anything, we're more likely to get such because of the two+ unannounced projects being scrapped.
---
People are going "woe is anet" because of the layoffs, but the layoffs were primarily focused on those projects, either by laying off those working on them, or by laying off people working on gw2 so that those working on the projects can return take their place.
---
By all evidence, GW2 will have no changes at worst, and improve at best, despite constant unfounded negativity like your post that goes against what we know and have been told.
---
Just a tip, you were downed and what you want to do when downed is either kill a enemy so that you can rally back up. Or press 4 and wait. Skill 4 is bandage and you shouldnt click other skills because it will cancel the action. 
---
Skill 3 makes a healing gtound atound you as a guardian so you get more boost to healing process.
---
Have fun :)
---
That's impossible to really tell without knowing how many people were pulled from the LW teams.
---
If a sizable amount got pulled to work on the projects, then sure, it shows they cared less about GW2 than the project; but then again, new games will take more work than expanding existing projects, and thus need more manpower anyways.
---
I wouldn't say that GW2 had no/low priority because of it, after all they came through and created a pretty damn good Episodes 4 and 5 with this "priority shifted". Even if they had plans to put GW2 in maintenance mode, it wouldn't have happened for a few more years since we had Season 5 announced. You don't abandon or gut out a team working on a project that has \~2 more years of content announced no matter how much you want to get another project going.
---
And all the work I put into upgrading a keep to T3 would be gone even more often. Sounds awesome /s
---
Thanks! Clearly I am still learning how to do things right haha 
---
Sword &gt; Gs on Support Chronomancer 
---
Seems normal to me! 
---
Biding my time until hammer gets buffed.  
---
The only classes which I think deserve updates to core weapons are Engi and Revenant.
---
Engi's core weapons are ATROCIOUS. They only have Pistol Shield and Rifle. 
---
Revenant's starting weapons may look many but due to how build locked/traitline locked Revs are, they essentially only have 3 or so usable loadouts. 
---
Assuming you are talking about Guard, Warrior and Ranger, there are condi and support specs of them that doesn't need GS.
---
Taking *"Oh man the devs are absolutely sick of this game, this ship is sinking"* from all that still doesn't amount to anything but treating pure speculation as face value
---
Even when things HAVE been pretty bad lately, it's like you all can't wait to see this game die
---
In-combat is also capped at 400, which is 90% higher than the base in-combat speed. That's plenty enough reason for me.
---
No, I cycle through my alts enough that this is never a problem.
---
-HAI CUI!
---
F
---
You can buy those recipes on TP.
---
Personal opinion: The armor skins/outfits would be great for my taste - if there were a way to turn off a) the spikes and b) the glowy bits. 
---
It's sad to have great looking clothes be ruined (for me) by all those weird appendages on them. They don't even look to be a coherent part of the design, just two random ice-truck buckets slapped onto the shoulders or random floodlights here and there.
---
1. noobtrap  
---
2. used by goldsellers to transfer gold  
---
3. used to inflate account value  
---
[Here's a piece using identical skin](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Warbeast_Jerkin)
---
Ok great answers both...I figured as much. I appreciate the detailed lists. I never thought of the multiple map completion rewards prospect. 
---
But, now I know I have no real need to kit them all out. I still haven't made my first Legendary yet so that's what I'm focusing on now. The Mastery tracks seem so tedious that I'd lose it if I had to do that for all of them lol. 
---
Who exactly is forcing you to use greatsword? There is a lot of content that can be completed easily without using the most minmaxed build possible or even without thinking about your build at all. 
---
The Devs have said that the teams are rather fluid in who's in them for each episode, so its not really the same team.
---
I just hope we get LS5 trailer soon after episode 6. I love Guild Wars 2 with all my life, but I'm not hyped for anything currently. 
---
No, you get 25% more damage per malice. That is too say, if you had a base stealth attack of an arbitrary number of 2000, and had one malice, your damage would be raised to 2500, and 5 malice would equal 4500 damage. It compounds on crit, so it can get pretty high if you Max your might, which is easy to do with deadeye (mash skill 3)
---
and do the endless mining/axe/plant do too? they're quite expensive at 1000
---
Frost bow only has 900 range and shares the same skin as a shortbow, so I think I would safely call it a shortbow. Also, not that there is necessarily a pattern but since tempest got an off hand and weaver got a main hand I think a two handed weapon or something like they did with spellbreaker (mace/mace? pistol/pistol?) would be suitable. Again though, there's not a pattern they follow as thief got a two handed weapon twice.
---
&gt; A **roamer** will duel other good **roamers** because there are so few 
---
so, you said this but also
---
&gt; People who run away are usually if not always zerglings. I was saying that its stupid that roamers should 'respect' people who want to run away to their zergs when a zerg will run over a single roamer every day of the week 
---
i guess you're not a roamer ;D
---
I completely agree. Big content updates, like you said, come with mystery and a desire to discover everything.  With the current setup, that feeling lasts for maybe ten minutes, because the maps are only so big, and we've experienced this style of content before.
---
I really hope LS5 sweeps me off my feet. But again, as you pointed out, ANet doesn't seem to want to tell us anything, and I think that's only hurting them in the long run.
---
I agree and what it to happen the most, an arcane archer would be nice. I could also see pistol doing cool shit thematically with all the elements.
---
BG?
---
Blackgate
---
You're certainly right that it's fun, I just worry that it may end up kind of too weak for some of the harder open world stuff, and a little too narrow of a playstyle. Absolutely dunks on lots of other things though.
---
You meant sigil of geomancy, right? Definitely very good sigil.
---
Or just hold right click while pressing A and D.
---
Here's a [Canthan expansion idea](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Lon-ami/Cantha#New_expansion_pack:_The_Celestial_Tournament) if you feel like dreaming.
---
this game's community is super friendly. Join us, be nice and you will find friends to join your adventures in no time.
---
I've heard this rumor as well, but I think it's just that, a rumor.
---
There's been multiple "fake" expansion leaks as well, which might have helped strengthen that rumor.
---
&gt;What really, does a Mirage bring to the table?
---
In PvE its a cDamage dealer with access to some of mesmer utility, like feedback or portal. Really useful against specific raid bosses.
---
I think your trouble there is twofold:
---
1)As you level, classes' strengths arent fully fleshed out. Mesmer still has strengths for interrupting and bursting, but not to the extent that it has at 80, and so on.
---
2)You're not fully used to active defenses. GW2 is somewhat more based on things like CC for survivability than WoW is, for soloing at least. On your Guardian you want to use things like Scepter 3, Hammer 4, Mace 3, Staff 5, Focus 5, etc to survive. CC your enemies, carefully time dodges, use your sustain and mobility abilities efficiently. Guardian health is low because their abilities give them so much survivability that they'd be broken in PVP otherwise, and PVE firebrand survivability is already unbelievable. Projectile reflects, big heals despite no healing power, blocks, stuns, etc...
---
Similarly for mesmer, you can do things like: Parry them with scepter 2, hope they aggro your clone instead of you- if not, shatter your clone to daze them so they cant act(or even better- interrupt an incoming attack of theirs, if possible!), then do something like use torch 4 to reposition or use focus 4-&gt;4 or pistol 5 to CC them.  That's not even getting into utility skills. If you have signet of ether and Phantasmal Defender, you can summon a brief tanking phantasm that does good damage twice in a row. You have to dodge, move, cc, and sustain properly to minimize damage while still letting yourself do good damage.
---
A lot of people seemed to assume this, but I don't think it was ever reasonable to assume a new expansion after season 4 was going to end unless it was going to go to 10 episodes or something.
---
Welcome to GW2, where the FPS is erratic/low and the hardware doesn’t matter! I’m your host Drew Carey!
---
Big chunks of content cater to more people as well. If you release an expansion with open world PvE, instanced PvE, PvP, and WvW features, you'll get everyone excited.
---
The whole product is also better the bigger it is, since they can plan the whole story and lore as a single element, instead of improvising with each episode.
---
&gt; What's the point of new maps, new story, and new achievements, if they suffer from pretty much the same problems LW1 had?
---
they don't.
---
most of your suggestions are decent QoL improvements.. but they could all be done regardless of what content gets released(or not) over the same time frame.
---
also, those are generally handled by separate teams... freezing content wont magically make the LW story writers able to tinker with PvP progression.
---
I agree. 
---
Except it cannot be done. It will always, always reduce to "chasing icons and doing chores for currencies".
---
He has so much potential too.  Maybe when we finally confront Jormag, we will find out he is "the mouth of jormag" or something.  It might make sense since in the first game Drakkar was the one whispering Jormags influence into certain norn especially Jora and her brother Svanir, who ends up becoming the first dragon corrupted creature The Nornbear, so who knows?  I just hope that theres a mention of Drakkar somewhere if they don't plan on putting him in the game.  He was really significant like you said.   
---
Do you mean the several talks about blood legion home lands?
---
&gt; Problem?
---
Depends on the map. LS3 was included in the list as it's a very easy way to get ascended trinkets. However the map matters. Each map provides different types of trinkets. Some maps are more farmable for currency (bitterfrost). Some maps are barely populated (doric)
---
Outstanding post with awesome suggestions.
---
His skills suggest he is an engineer
---
Does this all mean there is potential in the future for support of those injectors or the injectors need to update to be compatible? As is there any hope beyond custom shaders (I do not code but am very particular about how I want my game to look like so custom shaders made by others usually do not satisfy me) to see them work with dx12 at all?
---
It’s honestly the one thing holding me back from trying it, I simply cannot play the game with vanilla visuals. 
---
You are comparing a support role with a dps role. A druid is not better or worse than a soulbeast. It's different.
---
I totally agree. I just think the playerbase as a whole is so used to the quick fix and instant gratification that if the game where to essentially make all progression like crafting legendaries, people would lose their shit.
---
&gt; Before the layoffs, we were told LW5 was the next big thing, but that might not be the case anymore. 
---
IIRC, the people laid off were exclusively from a team working on an unannounced project. If that's the case, it's likely that ANet refocuses fully on GW2.
---
It's simply a matter of perspective. The LW system is fine, it keeps people coming back to the game and managed to deliver an engaging story since PoF. However now it's uncertain if Anet ever was working on a new expansion in the background. And I've been certainly looking forward to a new expansion. Expansions always bring something fresh and exciting to the game. They're something to get hyped for, a big drop of content that can keep you entertained for far longer than a LW episode.
---
And then there are the other parts of the game that didn't receive nearly enough resources even prior to the lay-offs. A new "raid" (= 3 bosses) ever 9 months. The same stale meta in WvW since the release of PoF. And seemingly only slow development on the new systems that are being worked on for sPvP and WvW. (The Warclaw is a fun addition to WvW, but it isn't what the vets were looking forward to.) No prospect of new elite specs or a new profession to bring something new to the mix while the balancing for PvP and WvW is so slow that the meta ever only marginally shifts every 3 months. (Although for raids they are doing quite good imo.)
---
If you are happy with the current release schedule there's no reason to be worried but if you were hoping for more than that you just don't know if you'll ever get it. 
---
Mirage is a very adept condition DD for endgame content. 
---
Wow that's high, thanks for the info!
---
Also make more moolah from Transmutation charges that way cos people might wanna wear it on multiple characters. 
---
Sounds like your triggered man it just needs some fixes like stability removing its effect, not being allowed on platforming fractals, have it not effect ramps and it not effecting skills that move you.
---
I definitely feel the same! Guild wars 2 is a game that means a lot and I love playing it.
---
Fair points - other than the idea that there will never be a non-instanced PvE map in the Mists. [One was planned for PoF](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/74qjlh/path_of_fire_devs_here_ask_us_anything/do0gvkl/) - that particular quote saying it wasn't possible came from around launch did it not? Additionally, while this would technically no longer be in the Mists - Jahai has shown that they're willing to go a bit Nightfall when it comes to this Kralk story.
---
I reckon there's a lot more mileage in this current arc than one episode. I definitely don't see how the sunspears/Pact can go from such a big failure to a win in an episode - I think Season 5 will be all Kralk. We haven't killed an Elder Dragon in a Living Story episode yet - it needs appropriate weight.
---
I have 14 characters and mostly play WvW. I have alts so I can play multiple classes. Beyond that, I have multiple of some classes that are running different builds. I do have multiple weapons and armour sets on some characters, but if the build and gear is totally different, I prefer to just have it on a new character so there's less messing around.
---
I'm not really.  It's because I'm playing a Mesmer right now, and learning from what others say how difficult Chrono is to play.  I'm not a skilled player so I know I could never be a Chrono.  Other choice is Mirage, but if I feel like that's an undesirable configuration(based on the responses in this thread), I would just dump it all together and move on.  So I wasn't comparing utility to DPS, as I know the differences there.  I was inquiring as to whether I'm going to have a hard time staying relevant and being invited to groups as a Mirage.
---
Understood - thanks!
---
These latest fractals add too much of everythin in twilight oasis its too much aoe and cc. deapstone is too much aoe. SR too many adds. Nightmare fractal is the best it had good amounts of adds, not alot of aoe some bullet hell and awesome boss fights with good mechanics.
---
The theory only got stronger after the introduction of the Olmakhan. In fact, my [original 2013 Jormag expansion idea](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Lon-ami/First_expansion_theorycrafting:_Jormag,_Tengu_and_Far_Shiverpeaks) already included a plot where the Flame Legion went into a civil war after Gaheron's death, and one of the pretenders was a shaman-backed female descendant of the Khan-Ur, which would align (willingly or by force) with Bangar to validate her title.
---
The Olmakhan are far more interesting though, but the point still stands. I wouldn't be surprised if Olma was a descendant of the Khan-Ur and this plot idea made it into the game in one way or another.
---
If mirage is undesirable than everything is.
---
Most of us would buy more outfits if this will possible and the technology is ready.
---
&gt;Condi DPS by itself is outclassed by power DPS in fractals regardless of the fight.
---
So, I've had a multitude of folks here recommend a Scourge Necro for me based on how I play.  If I'm understanding, the Scourge/Sceptor Necro is a condi-based build - no?  But I'm told they handle fractals very well.  Where am I confused?
---
Try a different build?
---
But the whole point of them making outfits over armor is they don't have to make sure the pieces all fit with every other possible piece (across all races and x2 for both genders).
---
Making the headpiece separate forces them to do that.
---
L2p
---
&gt; but I'd say that cannot happen at the expense of content releases. 
---
I don't want new content, if said content is going to suffer from the same problems of the last years. That's my point, ArenaNet is building one sand castle after another.
---
Calm down, evaluate your development model, and start producing stone castles once you've solidified it.
---
it's okay to have them be hard, but what's not okay is having to sit through countless repeats of same dialogue without skipping to attempt an achievement. 
---
now i just make sure to get the meta achievement and the time gated ones (will possibly need for next legendary trinket) and leave the map forever lol
---
I have sinned, father. I apologize. May I rectify with a short prayer to SnowCrows, Metabattle and dT?
---
Play condi builds :)
---
Nothing major will happen this year... so... well
---
Set character model limit to lowest, that's pretty much all you can do. 
---
&gt;This is all due to GW2 having no real gear treadmill
---
Not really. GW2 has a different progression system: Skins (aka Fashion Wars). Here's the real problem:
---
* We don't get enough skins through ingame rewards, and most of them look pretty bad.
---
* Many of those ingame skin rewards are too easy to get, making them have no prestige whatsoever.
---
* All the cool stuff is in the gem store. Some skins categories (like gliders and mounts) are mostly gem store exclusive.
---
Rewards are being neglected, that's all there is to it. Our endgame, skins, are mostly sold through the gem store. It's bordering a "pay to win" situation (where winning = acquiring skins).
---
That doesn't mean I'm against other types of progression, I feel like that should have been the goal of masteries in the first place.
---
&gt;Maybe Anet can come up with certain new rewards which are limited to a weekly or monthly rotation for players to farm, and they are tied to certain maps to encourage people to populate it.
---
That's the idea behind the daily redesign I suggested. GW1 solved the problem perfectly, we don't need to reinvent the wheel here.
---
I mean, we know GW2 was their lowest priority because they moved so many people off of it, including their all star devs like Josh Foreman. No one's disputed Jessica Price's characterization of how the LSes were being developed (ie, making it look like no one's been moved off of gw2) and Josh's own comments on it have kind of reinforced it. 
---
But honestly, if GW2 was a higher priority they would have had something more than LS planned. I can't really imagine GW2 surviving *just* on LS updates, and I'd be willing to bet that Anet was hoping to get their other projects to a point where they could announce them and just let GW2 officially move to the backburner. Why invest in an expansion if you're planning to sunset it? Or, to flip it, why would you *not* have an expansion in the works if you're planning to seriously support the game for a while longer?
---
Whoever did that stupid change probably has no idea of what he's doing, lore-wise.
---
What Arena Net needs to do the most right now is actually a good look at their game, at what they already released, what was successful, what each segment of players liked, try to find out why. Same for their failures. And not stop there, they need to take a look outside: what other MMOs are doing that worked and what they are doing that didn't work to see what can be taken as a lesson to use in their own game.
---
The main problem in my opinion is that it feels like they don't know their player base and sometimes they try to release content that seems to want to please all of them but fails by displeasing everyone, I would say the more casual oriented content is doing good enough at the moment which is fine, but nothing really exciting and cool thrown the way of the more mid/hardcore segments: PvP, WvW, Hardcore PvE. This is the dangerous part because these hardcore players are the one more engaged with the game, while they aren't the be-all and end-all of your income these and the achievement hunters are the ones who produce content, who keep playing during droughts, who keep the game populated, if you start bleeding this population it's when your game will hurt the most because years into this game it's easier to try to retain what you already have than to bring in new players.
---
Being very blunt, your suggestions aren't what will bring new players or help with player retention, they are nice things to have, but without anything to keep players busy or entertained it just won't work. QoL fixes are something you fit here and there between your regular releases cycle, you don't stop releasing new things just to do QoL updates unless these are making your game is a non-functional mess that no one can play and needs immediate fixing. Your ideas aren't bad, they just aren't what the game needs right now.
---
Stuff stuff stuff!
---
I wager we go after bubbles so if they have to they can say primordus and jormag can stay sleeping if they need to quickly wrap up the story in the future.
---
Thry also need sales post restructure, so I am expecting cantha more than I was before.
---
so you mean it "just" needs to basically be removed ?
---
Both ways are risky. It's up to you which risk you take:
---
* casting BiP then DS - sometimes a healer or chrono will accidentally cleanse your condis before you can transfer them
---
* casting DS then BiP - sometimes you'll accidentally autoattack and waste the transfer
---
I prefer the first one personally, mostly because I'm a chrono and pressing F5 in the middle of a spell is how you play chrono too. The second one is what is recommended by high level players because the potential risk is totally in your control. 
---
Yeah. Im one of the wow-fugees and having so much stuff that I can work towards really makes the game for me. Sure, this eventually ends (ascended pieces to name one) because of the ceiling is so low, so to speak. I recently got  the full mistwarden set that I can use as condi on Rev and the small things like that, set a goal and work towards it is so much more rewarding than the loot fiesta in wow atm.
---
I've *just* started the griffon quest and looking forward to getting it!
---
The big issue currently is meaningful repeatable content that is available to all of the player base. The best way to bring this in with minimal effort is to create an easy mode difficulty and allow CMs to be truly repeatable.
---
The benefits of this are multiple. Arenanet do not need new voice acting, new major graphical assets or new boss encounters to implement this.
---
For an easy mode, increase the player cap for raid instances to 15. This should allow for the difficulty of raids to be reduced to similar to the Lair of the Snowmen and will allow for a plethora of different, sub-optimal compositions. If people are struggling for damage, they can bring more DPS. Struggling to stay alive? More healers. Boons are poor? Rebalance for more support professions. With 15 people, mechanics also become far kinder.
---
For easy mode raids, do not allow LDs or LIs to drop. Unique ascended skins cannot drop. Achievements cannot be completed. Gold rewards are halved. Implement a new currency, 2 of which drop for each wing completed and allow these to be eventually used for crafting Legendary armor. Players can create this legendary armor when they graduate to normal mode raiding and complete the necessary collection.
---
Doing this opens up an untouched, and repeatable, portion of the game for players who might not otherwise consider it.
---
For a more challenging difficulty, implement increased rewards for completing a challenge mote boss after the first time; increased gold drops, food, higher chance of ascended items would all work. This should include things like Slippery Slubling and KC. 
---
This creates more content for experienced raiders - it is now about optimising your static runs to do as many CM bosses as possible should you raid for the rewards. Such a change will encourage more people to pug and attempt those encounters even if they've already done them.
---
The changes needed to implement this are minor compared with many other suggestions for player retention but have the benefit of adding in progression for people already easily clearing normal encounters and opening up a large repeatable portion of the game to people that do not complete raids currently. 
---
So right out of the gate, this opinion is the proverbial black sheep.  I've got to ask what other MMORPG's you played, and what your main was.  You may just have an amazing aptitude.
---
First of all, wouldnt really be outfits anymore, it would just be armor pieces
---
Second, Spongebob is shouting, using periods instead of exclamation marks is a meme crime
---
What does "Pirate ship" mean in this context?
---
A lot of the stuff mentioned by the creator of this post is right.
---
But what i think is really missing is as you said the long term progression.
---
Give us the opportunity to farm something meaningful, doesn't necessarily need to be better gear... but since gw2 is fashion wars 2 make it better looking gear, or , if that's too much work make infusions instead which are upgradable with mystic forge.
---
Make them earnable in different modes of the game pvp, wvw, raids, fractals and maybe even for open world events but there are already a few nice ones as rare drops.
---
Also make the content you got more repeatable, raids need to have something like "dungeon frequenter" with an opportunity to reopen a boss of your choice whenever you want and how often you want.   
---
Also as mentioned above a daily category for raids including some CM's (as a choice of dailies ) would be nice.  
---
A meaningful monthly would add a lot to the game and even if not a monthly you could do a weekly instead or even both?
---
I, as a gw2 player from launch without any major breaks can just advice anet to reconsider their opinions about reusing old content while making new content. That does not mean change the old content but reuse assets, world bosses (e.g. marionette) and stuff and give it meaningful rewards.  
---
On a final note one of the best experiences i had in gw2 was getting my pristine and normal fractal relics for god title... since it was something i was not able to get within a day... and it kinda meant something  
---
also after the final gen 2 legendary coming out with next LS episode. Please don't stop making legendaries... what would you grind for if not for them right now.
---
Well that was a lot of text in a comment but there is so much room for improvement of this existing games with i assume not sooo much effort compared to other stuff they make
---
Some of them had been previously working on GW2 and were moved off GW2 to work on unannounced projects. Some of the people fired worked on GW2.
---
Why?
---
Using Desert Shroud (F5) first followed by Blood is Power (BiP) when you don't have conditions on you makes for instant transfer due to the buff "Plague Sending", which transfers 2 conditions from you to the boss on your next attack after entering shroud. The Plague sending buff lasts for 5-10 seconds after entering shroud, thus by casting F5 first followed by BiP you are instantly transfering the condtions that are on you via self corruption without it harming you and losing it's potency (duration).
---
\---
---
Doing it the other way is not that much of a difference especially if you do it quickly, however when you are dealing with things such as Healing Spring and other sources of cleanse from your allies the conditions that you inflict on yourself might be cleansed instead of being transferred thus causing you to lose half the dps from BiP.
---
And that's why i uninstalled GW2 after the layoffs and am enjoying the fuck out of FFXIV right now.
---
They are too completely different games, and even though i wish FFXIV had some of the features GW2 has, FFXIV is a WAY BETTER MMO.
---
The design alone of the boss fights is insane. 100 CM Arkk is basically a low level dungeon boss in FFXIV in terms of mechanisms.
---
Yeah, that definitely makes sense.  Ultimately, you can enjoy tier 1-3 fractals with a lot of things very easily, you can enjoy open world with a tonnn of things, and mirage/scourge will be quite safe for raids, so that's a decent plan.
---
Necro has a bad reputation because of raids in the past, even though its always been great at PVP, WVW, and open world. Theres a large segment of the community that is VERY raid fixated and when necros were not preferable in raids, they acted like Necros were shit overall. It was really fucking annoying, honestly. Like yeah, they needed to be buffed in raids, but I even had people tell me they were shit in PVP because they got such a "necro is a poor suffering class that anet hates boo boo boo" mentality. I hate reddit herd behaviors, they get so weird and stupid.
---
Have fun leveling and stuff!
---
Upvoting for people to see. I hope the best for you throughout this process. o/
---
They need an expansion, preferably Cantha. Anything else and I might as well play other games.
---
TL;DR: unless playing through the full story is really important to you, you can skip them for now (or watch a YouTube summary) and buy what you want later.
---
In my opinion, LS2 only bridges the story gap between LS1 and HoT and provides a source of central Tyria mastery points. If you don't care about story, it's skippable (you can always pick up an episode or 2 later if you find you need the mastery points).
---
LS3 has some good farming opportunities for ascended trinkets/backpieces with HoT stats as well as tying up some loose ends from HoT and planting some seeds for PoF, story-wise. Even if you don't care for story, farmable ascended items are important for many players as a way to get into fractals/raids.
---
How do you propose we engage a playerbase to be highly social without meaningful gameplay to back that up? Honest question because I believe thats the opposite of what is happening. I see many player-organized events in LFG doing HP/World completion trains in Expansion maps, as well as LW/Expansion metas. My point is you cant ask people just to talk to eachother more, people need things to do as well. 
---
From my experience my guild is anything but lackluster, however we do suffer from burnout when content is not frequently released nor engaging. In fact just a few weeks ago we did a naked Dragon's Stand meta with \[RO\] which was super fun. 
---
I don't really see the point in any of these, to be honest. Changing up unranked isn't going to do anything for PvP, and your guild suggestions aren't going to magically make the same years-old boring-ass guild missions suddenly interesting again, nor is it going to make guild halls actually useful. 
---
No, these are all just tiny, largely inconsequential quality-of-life changes that do nothing to address what is fundamentally wrong with the GW2 content model: Living World; this insane focus on narrative-driven singleplayer content with next to no replayability. Give me replayable multiplayer content and I'll be more interested in playing the game more often than once every four months.
---
Chrono used to be hard. Lots of people who don't play chrono still have that assumption. In the past year, chrono has eaten nerf after nerf that both lowered its power (it's still very powerful though) and made it substantially easier to play. These days it's incredibly easy.
---
The only people who struggle with chrono these days are people who don't bother to research how to gear or play the class whatsoever. It's as easy to play as any other class, it's roughly middle-of-the-road in terms of difficulty. There are a few that are easier (thieves, core warriors, power heralds) and there are a few that are harder (renegades, holosmiths, weavers).
---
Leaks are actually like teaser to most ppl and they actually creates hype instead of killing it... If not, there will be no "trailer" "teaser" in the world.
---
Bothe male and female charrs have nice asses though
---
Can you dye the Phoenix glider?
---
They tried that already, though. They fovused on QoL instead of shiny content after LW1 and the playerbase was absolutely miserable. People were predicting it would kill the game. Activity slumped off drastically.
---
It's a bit unfortunate, but QoL alone isn't enough to get people logging in.
---
As with any game that allows full customization, people will inevitably flock to the meta. So you see the same builds over and over because that is the very max.
---
Do yourself a favor and make themed PVE builds that stay away from said meta. They offer a unique break from when you jump into PvP or WvW.
---
Classes who can use greatsword: mesmer, reaper, ranger, warrior, guardian
---
Classes who *should* use greatsword: reaper, power soulbeast, dragonhunter
---
What Guild Wars 2 needs now is to recover from losing 1/3rd of its workforce. It hasn't even been a month.
---
We fight Joko, we think we won. We are about to win. Joko is tired of our shit and is about to kill us. RKO out of nowhere. Meh.
---
I believe the only things you really get from LS2 are story achievement points, standard story awards, Luminescent Armor, and the Mawdrey backpiece. Since with LS2 the maps are playable for all you can get most of their rewards without buying the story chapters.
---
In LS3, you need each story chapter for each respective map, so each chapter has a lot more it unlocks. (Although there aren't a lot of full armor and weapon sets in the episde like they started doing in LS4). As the other guy said, they have a lot of ascended item opportunities and various interesting rewards from vendors. Plus IMO some of the LS3 maps and bosses are designed very well so I'd encourage getting it even if it's not introducing expansion-type features.
---
I've run GW2 on 5 different computers with a wide range of hardware and never had this performance pattern.  Frames will take a hit during busy fights, but be very stable otherwise.
---
I'm curious if anyone else has experienced your black-or-white performance issues, and what might be causing it.
---
**I don't want new content that is bad and gets abandoned after a few hours.**
---
I want them to improve their development process, so they can start making good content instead. Changes like these don't happen overnight, specially if you're already busy releasing stuff.
---
If 6 months of hiatus is what it takes for new content to be good, then fine with me. And if the new model has nothing to do with LW and story-based episodic releases, then so be it.
---
Different people, different priorities, I guess.
---
the feels
---
Fortunately, the trait system adds a little flavour.
---
Which story do you feel is the quickest these days for key farming? I've not made a key farmer in years, so maybe it's changed.
---
[This is the best thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8gctrf/full_guide_maximizing_your_fps_and_game/) I've found for improving FPS, including tips in the comments.  I would test each item out individually to see how it impacts performance.
---
Thanks for all the tips everyone! I will try to incorporate them next time I play
---
Mind explaining why? I think you're the first player I see who doesn't like them.
---
That’s a great idea- for the next game they make. The problem is... they already have GW2. If you figure you lose X players over a 6 month period while waiting for the next living world story, and then you recover .8X when the new release comes out, the issue is that the .2 you lost grows (probably exponentially) as the wait goes longer. If you stop putting out content, you lose players that don’t come back because of “QoL” changes, especially because the players that ebb and flow with the living world have been conditioned for Years to only come back for more content
---
And shadows to low
---
Fair explanation - and understood.  Out of curiosity, what are some ideal group compositions for the post t1-t3 fractals?
---
&gt;GW2 never had any problems with either quality or quantity.
---
Compared to other MMOs, we're far ahead. The problem is our content sucks, while other MMOs do more with less.
---
Look no further than WoW for an awful patch cadence, but good patch content.
---
Yeah, but the best of games will make interesting puzzles out of those base systems. 
---
Just fyi i was talking with survivalbloke in another thread and they dont really intend to do like Tier 4s, thus my emphasis on t1-t3. By "endgame" they meant mostly just "instances you do at level 80" rather than the most challenging stuff that a lot of gw2 non-open-world PVErs focus on. Sort of like the difference between just doing lfr/normal/heroic raids and mythic+0 to mythic+10 in wow, and doing mythic raids and mythic+16+ in wow.
---
Even if it works as intended, the 3s delay is too long for non PvE content. 
---
I feel like they should add weekly challenges that breathe life into a map or set of maps with a nice reward to encourage people of all levels to revisit dry maps. Something like slay X amount of champions, get gold in X amount of events, farm certain amount of nodes. Rotate them out at the end of the week and have them return at a later date. Put it into a rotation. 
---
Surprisingly enough lower level maps are pretty well populated, the real issue is the expansion open world maps.
---
Revisit core maps with LS releases. Conduct pact business at the order headquarters and then update content in those areas.
---
Focus on fewer new map releases (1 or 2) but section then off in chunks opened up with each episode, with a narrative of taking ground in the Dragon's territory. Then each small portion of the map can be filled with meaningful content.
---
Rebuild the core story campaign and LS1 with a built in achievement system that gives new and desirable rewards.
---
I think updates for current modes at a higher frequency would be enough... But we can dream. 
---
&gt; People who have completed season 1 of the living world 3 have a way to counter those circles
---
can you explain this further?
---
Seems devs took one or more tips from bless online developers. No wonder the company seem to be simply degrading after they fire 100 employers out of their company, its safe to say game is soon in same state as Bless online.
---
I think it's mildly inaccurate, but this is an internet forum, not a doctoral dissertation on the what the hell went wrong with GW2.  I do think that one of anet's main problems is their grandiose plans and promises, and their complete inability to even come close to fulfilling them.
---
im sorry, what?
---
wow has more raid bosses in last expansion than in total of gw2, plus constant class/system reworks.
---
while im  here doing a a coe.se.ac.ta.cof.hotw.arah dungeon tour for 2000th time 
---
Does owning catmander icon let you buy Commander's Wings of War?
---
Presumably a simple solution would be to award you with a token that can be turned into a map currency of your choice.  Kind of like the Ley Converter thingy.
---
Don't remind me of this I hate it so much because of it
---
Oh that sucks, guess I'll pass then.
---
Thank you for the answer though! 
---
This is why foregoing expansions for is a huge mistake and false economy in any MMO that tries it. The agile-development-constant-small-updates thing is only good in theory. Big expansions are to MMOs what Christmas is to retail. 
---
This won’t happen. LWS5 and an Expansion will.
---
There are significant numbers of both casual players and hardcore players. 
---
All money is good whether it comes from a hardcore or a casual or a mix. 
---
But hardcore players are passionate and very vocal and push for changes they like.  
---
Anet developers like any other person like praise, and if they cater to hardcore players they will get a lot of praise and promotion. 
---
But I believe one of the big attractions of gw1 and gw2 is how they can cater to a wide range of players and make money off all of them. 
---
I believe that forgetting the wide range of players they make money off is hurting their revenue. 
---
Just because a big sector of their players is not as loud as another sector does not mean their money is not good. 
---
Both hardcore, casual and the mix of players contribute to Anet’s bottom line. 
---
why not both? we still need new content, we still want new areas. sure they suffer from abandonment not long after theyre completed, but with a team focused on qol issues from past maps working on them, and other teams making new chapters (and each new chapter getting the qol changes during its production), then we can have both.
---
I love playing the game with its world, characters, music, visuals, but it could stand to be a better /game/
---
I don't see anything that restricts you from buying a recipe (or materials) from TP without having the appropriate expansion.
---
The main factor stopping people from crafting expansion-"exclusive" content was and is account-bound crafting materials.
---
&gt; the 2 power dps burst stuff to death quickly and efficiently, and thus safely

Elementalists?
---
I'm having a lot more stuttering in this version.  
---
Every now and then; the screen freezes for about 5-10 seconds.  
---
Word of mouth doesnt work when I have to bring my laptop around with me so they can know what I'm mouthing about. Word of mouth only works when the person was already interested, and is not a situation that people will find themselves in very often. Anet silence is literally spelling out our fears and I'm sorry but while my interpretation is on me and does not have a place in the word of mouth i generate for this game, it is one that has had plenty of time to be completely dissolved now. It's easier to do than Colin Johansons precedents with hype makes them think.
---
There's a far stretch between a doctoral dissertation, and "this is the Internet so any old bullshit will do because I'm pushing my agenda."   
---
You are grossly inaccurate, because all your statements of your opinions of ArenaNet's performance in the past are meaningless when applied to what is possible today.  
---
If this was just another day of shitposting in /r/Guildwars2, "mildly inaccurate" may be passable.  But this isn't just another day.  The studio just lost a massive percentage of its staff.  And it's inevitable for that much change to have an impact in both strategy and deliverable content.
---
I agree they should do a content  hiatus, but most of what you listed we're just small QoL changes that wouldn't need a content hiatus to do. If they were to stop moving the LS stuff forward, they would need to focus on making content replayability the core goal. They did the kind of updates I would want before with some world bosses. The changes they made to Tequatle and the Shatterer should be what they should work on for now. But expand this to Dungeons. 
---
If they update dungeons and make them a focus again, they could do so much for the game. Make challenge motes for dungeons with the chances for ascended armor rewards. Update the boss fights to be more engaging again to match the power creep.
---
Reining the content that's already designed for daily engagement just makes sense. They lost a lot of players when they outright abandoned the content. For newer players getting into the game, it's never a good sign when a ton of the content you have the easiest access to get into is officially abandoned and hasn't been touched in years. 
---
I just did this and it has helped immensely! Great advice! 
---
You misunderstand me. 
---
PvP was my main thing for 5 years and it only taught me one things: this company deserves to fucking crash and burn.
---
The problem is blem with roads and fractals is that they serve a tiny minority of the player base.  The vast majority of players of any mmo don't engage with the game outside of open world PvE and small group content.
---
GW2 stopped developing small group dungeons for whatever bizzare ass reason, and the onboarding for fractals is god-awful so most people never even try them. 
---
'my agenda"  You're cute.
---
Please don't talk about topics you have no idea about.
---
It makes you look like a foolish child that's on an incomprehensible rant.
---
&gt;Dailies
---
I would like ANet to add a PvE reward track that is tracked through experience points. The way to advance the reward track is through exp. The purpose of this is because the entire zone becomes the playground. You can gather stuff for exp, you can kill mobs for exp, you can do events for exp. You won't limited to be stuck in one small area where Hearts are.

Afterwards, If ANet wants to additionally refine PvE reward tracks, put more and more dynamic events everywhere in all corners of the zone. 
---
Yes. Popular bursty power classes are:
---
* Weaver (Elementalist)
---
   * high burst and sustained damage
---
   * semi-difficult skill rotation and heavy reliance on counting autoattacks to ensure that you never miss the powerful 3rd attack of the sword's autoattack chain
---
   * little to no group support or utility
---
* Dragonhunter
---
   * high burst, medium-high sustained damage
---
   * easy rotation
---
   * high cleave (ability to hit multiple targets at once)
---
   * limited group support from blocks and minor heals
---
   * decent utility from pulling enemies together
---
* Holosmith
---
   * very high burst, medium sustained damage
---
   * somewhat difficult skill rotation. but it has a good flow so it's pleasant once actually learned
---
   * very high cleave
---
   * decent utility from ability to stun/CC enemies to break their breakbars
---
* Daredevil
---
   * low-medium burst but high sustained damage
---
   * extremely easy to play
---
* Soulbeast
---
   * high burst, medium sustained damage (not 100% sure, this is one of the few builds I don't play)
---
   * ability to bring great utility skills that Druids normally bring, if Druids aren't available
---
He means the first mastery in the LW3 mastery line (added with LW3 episode 1). This mastery allows you to block/reflect some abilities related to LW3 and Side stories. (examples are the skills of the bandit champions, the overload or the legendary boss in bloodstone fen, or the bloodstone-crazed creatures attacks.
---
I'm also getting more stuttering with this version, both before and after I cleared the shader cache.
---
I’m sorry. Didn’t anet just release a new wvw mount?  Didn’t they say they are heading straight into season5? Didn’t they just have mass layoffs that may require a bit more then a few weeks to figure their shit out? Didn’t they cancel all unannounced projects, leaving GW2 as the only game they have to make revenue from? Didn’t the game director confirm GW2 will be unaffected? You’re a fool dude. Calm down. 
---
You can do about 90% of the things with a group of 5 people in EotM. The one thing you cannot do in EotM can be solo'd by yourself. You don't need a squad.
---
Think of two ships next to each other firing broadsides from their cannons. Now replace the ships with zergs and the cannons with hammer Revs and the like.
---
&gt; GW2 never had any problems with either quality or quantity
---
Riiiight.
---
Sorry, but a lack of quality was and still is **the** biggest flaw of GW2's ongoing development. It affects everything, from a lack of an optimized engine which results in bad FPS in mass fights and WvW maps too tiny to actually evoke the strategic combat of DAoC, over tons of excessive traits and skills with way too many overloaded effects, to mounts getting stuck on tiniest pieces of scenery while clipping through walls elsewhere.
---
All of GW2 screams "limited budget development". Which is fine, don't get me wrong. For a game I don't play monthly for, the quality offered **is** impressive. The overall lack of if it still the game's big achilles heel, however. 
---
When I do play WvW, I'm specifically looking for large-scale squad combat. I get my rewards from raiding, all I'm interested in when I join WvW is the gameplay and coordination of huge scale combat.
---
&gt; No pictures, no nothing.
---
Fans generate this in the form of art, screenshots, streams, youtube videos, etc. Anet could develop a fan kit, but it would need updating frequently, and that's not a good expense of resources - they're very often abandoned fast after creation with other games, or only updated on expack releases.
---
&gt; No hints at the content they already promised
---
Par for the course. There isn't anything being released because there's nothing to release - they do a good job with their trailers, and have set expectations around this very well. A better schedule and earlier notice would be nice, but it's simply not the strategy they've chosen.
---
Marketing is weird. It's not always transparent, and not all of it ever fits into what people think of as The Campaign. There are still ads going up, social media posts happening, forum interactions - all of this is marketing. Their SEO work, their updating of the gem store, that's marketing too.
---
If you think there isn't a huge volume of activity going on from that department, you're missing a lot of details.
---
Source; I work in web marketing and have for 10 years.
---
I'm not arguing that my CPU is old, or the bottle neck.  It also runs at a higher clock speed out of the box than is listed there.  I'm on Windows 7, and fully power down my PC every night.  I play most every game on Ultra settings, so it isn't that bad. 
---
But I it is the random FPS I get when I play the game that is weird, sometimes low, sometimes smooth as dolyak butter.  
---
Guild stuff for sure needs a revamp. That's the killer of this game for a lot of people.
---
If this is your excuse, then you should go join a T1 server...because at this point in your argument, it's not about the acquisition of the warclaw anymore.
---
And most of the QoL improvements don’t directly correlate to increased gem sales/revenue.
---
Mastery tracks are account wide. Max them out once and every character gets the benefit.
---
Getting an alt going is just:
---
* Level to 80
---
* Gear up (you could make a legendary weapon or fully gear three characters in Ascended or fully gear like 10+ characters in Exotic)
---
* Hero points for elite specs
---
And if you *have* alts with birthdays, you'll get Instant LvX scrolls (a two year old character gets an instant Lv20 scroll for its birthday, a six year old gets Lv60 etc) making it quicker and quicker to make characters the more characters you have).
---
Are we playing the same game? I think you are going to have to quantify what you think is actually so bad about this content... and what you  mean by abandoned...
---
I might not be able to find big groups in all zones at all times but just casually running around and keeping an eye open I've alway been able to find large enough groups of players to do content in any zone at some point. 
---
I feel like I regularly encounter Zergs of people so large that my character limit kicks in and many of them are the default look... even in supposedly dead maps.
---
I for one haven't maps due to feeling like the content was bad, I haven't been back because there is simply so much other stuff to do I don't have time to get to it all. And I tend, i think like most players, to with limited time gravitate towards if I am going to only redo some things, it's the most reward ones... if anything rewards being vastly uneven feeling zone to zone is the greater problem...
---
I outright feel that some of your suggestions would not only be extremely unhealthy for the game, they would make the things you are complaining about worse.
---
I have a solid 2.5k hours across all characters. There were days. Happy days. Where all I could do was think about getting home to play. 
---
But time treads on. Uncaring. Or at the very least, ignorant as to our wants. 
---
At the end of it all, I can say that I look back fondly on those days. It was a different era. I was a different person. 
---
Sometimes, my past will look to me instead. It will ask a question that I wish I had the answer to.
---
The mute words echo in my mind.
---
“Build template when?”
---
I respond silently.
---
“Fuck if I know. Bitchin mounts tho”
---
The past will fade into its own with a single word.
---
“Sweet”
---
In all seriousness. Yeah I love this game. I lived this game in high school. My attention is elsewhere these days, but I enjoy coming back every once in a while, and especially when a new episode drops. It’s a shame I don’t feel the same now as I did then. 
---
Birds is worse. Fuck them OP birds.
---
None of these *only* cost 400 gems, but if you don't have any gem store upgrades you'll get more bang for your buck (or gold) out of these than some shiny glider. In order:
---
1. MISTLOCK SANCTUARY PASS. Seriously, this offers so much more up front compared to every other convenience item in the game. Not only is it the best crafting/shop hub and the ability to use its facilities without losing your place in the open world, but it's also basically a slightly less convenient version of the salvage-o-matics and infinite harvesting tools for all your characters due to the ability to buy regular tools and basic salvage kits in your pocket dimension. Other lounge passes like the Royal Terrace or Lava Lounge actually teleport you to another map. If you do Fractals, you can even park alts at resource farms or JP chests and still bring them into fractals without losing that place in the world. It's the best convenience item in the game, bar none. If you'd rather have a battle arena and access to WvW team chat than a Fractal entrance, you could also pick up the Armistice Bastion pass which also works like the Mistlock Sanctuary and stores your open world position. 
---
2. Shared Inventory Slot (if you don't have a spare one). You'll use one of your two free ones for the Mistlock Sanctuary pass. You'll need another for:
---
3. Copper salvage-o-matic. Don't bother with silver or runecrafter, their return over using silver instead of mystic for rares and runecrafter over copper for greens will take an eternity to pay off and the runecrafter in particular will make "right click salvage all" more of a hassle than just sticking with the copper.
---
4. A progressive investment a lot of people overlook is the Living Story Season 2 episode "Tangled Paths". This costs 200 gems and provides you with a Black Lion Key once per character on completion. This means you're getting five keys for 200 gems base, and adding a key's worth of value to every character you make in the future. 
---
5. Once you have these, get upgrades as you see fit. Remember that buying a character slot and throwing a bunch of 18s bags on it is far cheaper per inventory slot than buying a bank tab.
---
Funny how one of the most common repeatable activities in the game is the result of ANet removing gameplay rather than adding it themselves! You're right though, they should look at the reasons *why* people do weekly key runs rather than trying to innovate everything all the time and then we end up with masteries that are only designed to be major elements in one tiny part of the game, and only for a few months until everyone moves on to the new shiny stuff.
---
thank you 
---
It's a raptor/jackal/skimmer while taking all the worse part about them.
---
Yeah, they are choosing to take a dump on top of the PvE hardcore part of their player base causing guilds once full of dedicated players bleed members moving to other games. Not sure if this is a good choice but with that said, between long release intervals and quality of the raid content you could say this is definitely not the game to raid. They failed, so it's fair for them to give up if they want to.
---
They even helped to bleed even more players from the same group by adding random instabilities to fractals, and by adding and not fixing new instabilities that everyone who is invested into the content don't enjoy...
---
It’s 2019 and GW2 still hasn’t figured out a superior form of horizontal progression that would replace traditional gear/ability based progression.
---
Make people still want to do dailies, or more of them, by 1) increasing their rewards, 2) making them more fun and varied, and 3) making them stand out more rather than being divided into categories for each map.
---
Everyone here with quality insights and I'm just over here like "it would be cool to just add to a stack in the guild bank without having to take the original item out, stack it in my bag, then put it back".
---
Mistlock pass is so much better as a first purchase than the copper salvage kit. New players haven't had time to be frustrated buying a bunch of basic kits and toting them on characters, and having a pocket dimension that functions as a discounted:
---
* infinite Trading Post express
---
* infinite bank access express
---
* infinite Merchant express
---
* infinite gathering tools
---
* infinite salvage kit
---
in *ONE* item, with the caveat of requiring two load screens to do those things, is worth so much more than never needing to restock your salvage kit.
---
Stack boosters that increase participation.
---
How would you make them more "fun?"
---
I’d wager that those who work together well tend to stay together more.
---
Just give us Lyssa's standalone helm already, ffs.
---
Introduce unique objectives that are unique or different from those for existing dailies, including dead content. Some inspiration could be taken from older dailies that no appear, which relied more on the game's combat mechanics.
---
&gt; If you didn't buy gems somewhere in the process there, you are literally hurting the game because nothing you do while logged in actually pays for anyone
---
Are you trying to make us feel guilty for not buying useless shit from the gemstore?
---
RuneScape is an amazing game that everyone should try.  
---
MapleStory 1 is free and pretty great. Don't play MapleStory 2.
---
I wouldn't say GW2 is among the top 2 MMO's out currently, ESO or WoW would be in the top spots along with FFXIV if anything, even with all the current problems in WoW. Top 5, yeah.
---
&gt; That may very well be, but as you mentioned, dungeons, which were great content got abandoned and no new ones added.
---
My hope is that now that they've dropped raid development, they'll turn those resources towards making some new dungeons finally.   
---
But we'll see...
---
And that d912pxy makes the ground and a lot of objects load far more slowly upon changing maps.
---
I have bad news for you. They are still mostly the same people at ArenaNet whose business cards say content marketing, brand management or similar things. They are still incompetent. 
---
I think you hit the nail on the head. I don't enjoy the story of this game, I think it's poorly written and convoluted, as a result of this I feel like the game really hasn't had an enjoyable update in months, if not over a year (I don't enjoy mount races either).
---
PvE wise, I've played a lot of Maplestory, Mabinogi, Ragnarok Online, and FlyFF. Angels Online, Wonderland Online, Trickster online, and LaTale were a couple others, just not as much.
---
GW2 was the only game I really did any PVP in.
---
So, almost 12 days later, I'm curious! How are you still faring in WvW? Still sticking it out? I hope this post finds you doing so, but if not, that's okay too. 
---
Correct. Since PoF is routinely on sale for $15, that distinction is irrelevant to me.
---
GW1 and GW2 are a huge piece of me, mainly because I met my husband because of them and made a giant leap to immigrate to a whole other country for him. 4 of my guildies were in attendance at our wedding, one as a bridesmaid and one as a groomsmen. 
---
They drove hours to my hometown in Canada from Ohio and Indiana respectively to meet us for the first time, and be in our wedding.
---
The other drove up with his wife from South Carolina to attend and also meet us for the first time.
---
Some members of my family who live maybe an hour away minutes away said they couldn't come to my wedding but friends I'd never met in person drove hours to come up for it.
---
My husband doesn't enjoy the game as much but I'm still here.... 34 characters in tow with a Quaggan plush my best friend crocheted for me. 
---
I listen to the soundtrack daily, its great! My husband actually doesn't skip songs from it when I put my old iPod on for roadtrips in the car.
---
I don't think this game will ever leave me. 
---
Can't they do that with regular raids?
---
Which is a much, much higher completion rate than raids in WoW *before* it was introduced. It is also a player retention method as it provides players with new content that they can repeat that would otherwise be inaccessible.
---
How i can solve bugs that are not reported? You can try new release, maybe it fixed =\] 
---
If you end up needing to feel stronger in some way while leveling necro, just send me a message and I'll send you some tips like the mesmer one I gave before.
---
If you have trouble with revenant, here's some advice for leveling revenant, like that mesmer advice. Ive never leveled it before, but these should be the things you try to get first if you want to be more powerful.
---
You'll want to get a heal from two different stances first, so that even when you have few utility skills you can pop into a different stance to get a different heal. Helps with sustain. (Unless it already starts you with two heal skills unlocked...?)
---
Under Invocation get Fierce Infusion(bottom of first column) and Incensed Response(bottom of 2nd column). Use your heal skill regularly and swap stances regularly and youll have lots of might and fury!
---
Under Retribution, Planar Protection(Top of the first column) is a nice skill that, whenever you use a healing skill(20 second cooldown on the trait tho), it will create an anti-projectile dome that also weakens the offense of melees inside. Good for survivability.
---
The Elite skill for Legendary Assassin stance is very nice. Big AOE stun!
---
Some gold, exotic drops, LI/LD alternatives to encourage players to progress into normal mode raiding (since they may have enough currency to get the legendary armor after only the achievements) and I said nothing about shards but the other advantages are;
---
* New content to play for some people
---
* More content to play for others (easier bosses with 15 people that may not have been doable for that group with 10)
---
* Learning mechanics
---
* Additional repeatable content in a game that *really really needs it*.
---
Well, that spoiled the episode I've had months to play and couldn't be fucked doing
---
Apparently not as we wouldn't (still) get threads on the official forums about the need for easier difficulties and how raids are elitist and exclusive.
---
Yeah, back in the day I bought a character slot with 3g. That was ALL my gold. 
---
Oh. Yes. Copy/paste fail. Apologies 😓
---
So, they'd have to program a third squad mode for 15 people?  I mean, why would you kill raid bosses, and not world bosses?   Because new content?  Maybe when HoT was released, but not now.
---
I don't think raids are too hard.  I'm not the best player, and I'm close to finishing my third set of armor, and I'm just waiting for wing 7 to get the ring.  (plus, I think raids are dead after wing 7)
---
I’m playing on a 12 core Xeon workstation with dual GPUs and 64GB RAM. I checked the new ini file, and was curious if there’s documentation on which flags activate which new option (utilize all RAM, etc)? I went ahead and set the Boolean flags at 1 (except the very first one under pooling), but want to confirm. Thanks!
---
Don't bother with EB. Go to a Borderland, and so long as you aren't playing at way off-peak times for your area, there should almost always be a commander on at least one of them. It's very rare that I enter WvW and can't find a commander, so I'm not really sure why you're having so much trouble finding one. Usually there's at least one, sometimes two or three, on every map. If there's not one on your map, pay attention to Team chat and it usually becomes clear pretty quickly what map has all the action on it. Or ask.
---
If you really are on a server where there are never any commanders when you're around, I honestly don't know what to tell you or what you're expecting anyone else to tell you. We can't magically make them appear for you. I guess all you can really do is either try playing at a different time (reset on Friday evening is good) or learn to be patient. Plenty of casual players have already gotten their Warclaw just fine, so being casual has nothing to do with it. If you want something, you have to be willing to set aside the time for it. That's just how it is.
---
I dont know why guys like you get the idea that they need promotional material from unreleased content in order to promote the game.
---
Its buy to play, so promotion and marketing should focus on the already released and accessible content because thats what you buy, not what Anet plans to release in the next year or so.
---
Future content only becomes relevant for the customer and marketing, if they have to decide on paying a subscription, in my opinion, and thats not the case with GW2.
---
"I'll go first!"
---
*Proceeds to stand around like a doofus while I wail on his ass with Hundred Blades*
---
Well yea. After those 500 hours and reaching the end-endgame I realized the game consists mostly of daily quests. Which is why I stopped playing myself eventually. It had potential. Sad to hear
---
Because it is a huge amount less effort than the other suggestions put forward, opens up content that isn't accessible and increases player retention by giving those players something to work towards (both raid difficulty progression and legendary armor).
---
The topic is literally about improving the game to keep players so I think increasing the instance cap to 15 people and making a few minor changes is potentially more accessible than a lot of other popular suggestions such as dungeon reworks.
---
I don't seem to have that in the config  
---
In what group does it go?  
---
That's great! I also don't think raids are too hard, having 1400+ LI/LDs, CMs, VitV and so on.
---
That doesn't mean that raids are accessible for everyone. If raids do end up dead after Wing 7, as in no new raid wings, players will still need incentive to do them - the introduction of an easy mode and repeatable CMs achieves that with minimum resources.
---
That mount was never asked for and is causing more issues than it solved, pretty much like everyone said before release.
---
I really can't see why the hair is better, the clipping seems to be even worse.
---
The armors however... well it's nothing that get's me really exited, but I'm all for new armor parts to toy around with, fantasy stuff like this, historical inspirated armor (medival knight, Vikings, Samurai... whatever) and whatever brings more diversity in looks, so yes, why not.
---
Oh please. That’s not even close to true. You’re one of those that look for any reason to complain. 
---
if there was space for a "polishing" team that would _only_ work on sprucing up older content that'd be great; but I don't think releasing less new content is good for the game.

It needs both content and QoL.  This game won't last one just one or the other.
---
They need to 100% change it up though.  I'd like to enjoy this game again.  Map completion and hearts are not what I want to do 6 years into this game.
---
Living story season 2 is 2 maps that you already have access (Dry Top and The Silverwastes), the story right before Heart of Thorns, some achievements, collections, mastery points (not needed to complete mastery unlocks), and some items. The real reason you get it is if you want to play through the story yourself, the other rewards aren't worth the cost IMO. It should also be mentioned that you can join someone else's story if they own season 2 and you do not (you just don't get the story rewards or achievements). So if you don't care about the story I would skip it.
---
Season 3 on the other hand is 6 new maps, a lot of story (right after Heart of Thorns and leading up to Path of Fire), and still the best way of getting ascended trinkets. I would suggest getting the whole pack at a discount but if you want to only get one bitterfrost (Episode 3: A Crack in the Ice) is your best choice.
---
Oh and if you're trying to save money on the expansions get them on sale (like [38% off on DLGamer](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911)) or wait for a larger sale (up to 50% usually)

---
&gt; What makes people think Cantha or whatever would be different.
---
The subreddit has this mystical hard-on for declaring that Cantha is the panacea to fix all of GW2's woes. The land where lemon drops grow on trees and everything becomes fresh and new and fun forevermore. 
---
&gt; it's not really fair to pretend like other opinions don't exist.
---
Since I never did that, I have no idea what point you think you're making.
---
Also...
---
I would like to see some of the living world mastery unlocks implemented throughout the rest if the game. As of now, they are mostly gated to their particular map.
---
Higher drop rates for ascended gear in T4 Fractals.
---
More PvP maps,  quicker matchmaking, and better looking legendary armors (WvW as well).
---
An easier way for players to learn raids... like having T1 - T4 ( or having a raid difficulty and reward reduced for eating foods) allowing less hardcore players to populate the beautifully crafted raid-runs.
---
This is actually a pretty reasonable answer if you don't consider the sellers to have ulterior motives.
---
Because it's not undesirable at all.
---
The *only* caveat is T4 fractals, where people are more focused on killing fast and want Power-based builds for that, so it's not anything against Mirage specifically, just a dislike of condi builds in general for that particular content.
---
Outside of that, Mirage is absolutely great. It's fine in T1-T3 fractals, so long as your group isn't full of wannabe elitists who try to run everything like it's a T4 CM. It's some of the best condi DPS in the game, and it's very survivable, which makes it fine for open world if you don't mind a little ramp-up time. It's still strong in PvP and WvW (roaming, not zerg) even after the nerfs. It's THE meta condi class on raid bosses that favor condition damage, to the point where raid groups will often *specifically* request mirages over any other condi class.
---
So I'm not even sure where you're getting the idea that mirages are undesirable at all. That *one* guy in one response said they were terrible/useless in fractals and mediocre in open world -- and not only is that a ridiculous exaggeration on both counts, pretty much everyone else in this thread has disagreed with him (the exception being T4 fractals, where it's true that most groups won't want you). I don't think being limited from one very specific set of a very specific type of content makes a class "undesirable" at all. Compared to a lot of other specs, Mirages have it really good.
---
So if Mirages are undesirable, everything else must be too.
---
Key runs are great, but what most players need is a solid content guide to tell them about key runs and what makes them fun and rewarding.
---
Frankly it's what the game needs as a whole. Loads of interesting achievements, content, and opportunities to join forces with guild members and friends alike, and the only tour guide the game has serves as a map completion engine.
---
I have no idea what it should look like, how it should function, or what kinds of incentives it should offer, but GW2 needs a proper way to encourage casual and veteran players alike to engage with various forms of content. 
---
1. Make an ex-pack
---
2. skip the story content takes up to much dev time
---
3. add build templates
---
4. add new world bosses
---
5. new mounts
---
6. add a new race, screw the story tho
---
7. OVERprice the fuck outta it and avoid rage by giving people what they want (exclusive mount skins work too)
---
8. take the money and start Making Gw3
---
I just installed this program for the first time, wow, never knew this was a thing. Thanks for the program it's really good. I just hope that the anti-cheat doesn't get triggered by something.
---
Blade &amp; Soul had amazing raids. I quit the game mainly because it's super p2w and I felt really bad knowing how much of an advantage people in some huge whale clans had in the game because they have no problem casually dropping thousands of dollars on microtransactions.
---
But honestly the raids in terms of difficulty were *so* much more complex, challenging, and fun compared to GW2 raids that they are hardly comparable. The easiest of the raid bosses of the first raid, which came out years ago, is more complex than pretty much any raid mechanics on here. The dungeons also used to be really fun, but they started making things really anti-melee friendly later on before I quit which I didn't like.
---
Ultimately I chose to return to GW2 for a reason, mainly because I don't want to feel bad about wanting to take breaks here and there and play a game casually instead of like it's an extra job.
---
No.
---
Actually Mirage is extremely strong in the open world too. It doesn't have the damage output and burst capabilities of, say, ele or guard, but it is nearly immortal. It is among the easiest builds (in both power and condi variants) to solo stuff.
---
No, you’re making that up. People just really want to see Cantha, that’s all there is to it. 
---
That's a funny looking centaur. Where'd you get it?
---
No. Story and Lore are cool. This would change gw2 to a h&amp;s 
---
I'd thought Lon was about the lackluster state of the guild system &amp; guild missions.  They're not wrong.  Guild Halls are pretty much a gold sink or a material sink if you enjoy having a decorative sandbox.  I tend to forget that they exist most days.    
---
Yeah Kodan only works if you pull off this bug
---
I want a raid that consists purely of downhill beetle races. Giant, 10 minute or longer downhill slolems with well-built AI racers your team has to deal with.
---
&gt; That's cause wow is a game whose end game is entirely focused on raid content.
---
Except for the massive amount of non raid content.
---
Apparently not. You can see the complete list [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem_Store/March_Sale).
---
It seems like every new player wants to go to ebg. Today my server had a 40 man queue on ebg while 0 queues on the borders. One of the borders even had a commander with almost a full squad.
---
Some one know why my game no start when i instal it 
---
hybrid scourge even worth running now? Condi part of it seems dead in the water.
---
Yea I like the idea of them adding new zones but I never have a reason to do them much as I refuse to grind out currencies and achievements are boring.
---
To give your guild a reason?  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
&gt; I have no idea what it should look like, how it should function, or what kinds of incentives it should offer, but GW2 needs a proper way to encourage casual and veteran players alike to engage with various forms of content.
---
Thats the thing though, interesting content and achievements are not easy to design and they won't come on short term, while the old and underplayed content will continue to get older as we wait. Making reward fixes/changes in comparison is quicker and easier to implement, and isn't necessarily mutually exclusive with any content changes.
---
Key runs show that people are willing do content regularly even when its mundane. I think keys can be used to make some of the old and underused content relevant again in the same regard. And yes, as you said, exposure and guides to these new reward changes and content would help.
---
As for content changes, I think creative energy should be saved for making the future content more engaging rather than changing old content. I mean, if changing rewards in old content would prove to be effective, there is no need to spend more resources for a complete overhaul.
---
I accidentally deleted my previous comment. Sorry about that, but it was quite similar to this.
---
Hey thanks again for the update, should threads=1 be set to anything besides default? Using a Ryzen 2700X (8c16t).
---
Thanks in advance!
---
It's like a radioactive booger wearing a suit inspired by the movie Carrie.
---
Please try and make this coherent next time, thanks.
---
Same here, keep getting dced to character select screen every 20mins
---
Im running Windows 7 right now, that means this plugin wont work at all for me, will it?
---
Have some pride and say u fucked up
---
Good luck with that. Every time I get a spare slot, thinking I'll use it for keyfarming, I end up enjoying the character and keeping them. :c
---
I still like it as is for [elementalists](https://youtu.be/TpBbLj8FIL0?t=41), especially the fire-themed one, with its phoenix sound and with the molten gathering tools to match.
---
There are so many QoL changes they could add which would make the game so much more enjoyable. And if something that's on this list is already in game, then that's probably a sign that it should be made more noticeable or intuitive.
---
- BUILD. TEMPLATES.
---
- BETTER PERFORMANCE.
---
- The ability to select specific story missions in chapters.
---
- The ability to skip dialogue in story missions we've played through already.
---
- A dueling system for the open world.
---
- Dye templates and cosmetic templates.
---
- Pin specific currencies to bottom of inventory.
---
- Storage for intermediate crafting products across all professions.
---
- If the mystic forge accessed the bank, like every other crafting interface.
---
- The ability to purchase or list multiple stacks at once in the market.
---
- The ability to label bank tabs.
---
- Another hotbar for binding specific items in the inventory. Wouldn't be enabled by default but it would exist in the menu. I'm tired of opening my inventory to select SW shovels or food. 
---
- Toggle default for market: default to gem store, or TP.
---
- In the store, a button with  theprice in gold would be displayed alongside gem price, and if selected, the gold would be instantly converted to the appropriate amount of gems for the purchase.
---
- The ability to gift stuff like hairstyle kits that I know I will never use. I don’t want these in my bank but I can’t bear to throw them away. Even if I had to eat some cost to gift them, at least I'd be making somebody happy.
---
- Display probability values for drops from BL chests, like Apex Legends does with their boxes.
---
- Trade chat, so interested players can get deals or barter with mats.
---
- An ingame DPS or healing meter, and the ability to see the numerical healthpool of a boss. I'd like to actually measure the efficacy of my builds in a more intuitive way, **please**.
---
- A lot of the old content is starting to die. It would be good of the world bosses in LWS3 zones scaled down further, or they added reasons to return to that content and increase pop.
---
- The ability to inspect other players. Apparently this isn't an option for reasons of toxicity or something? But seriously, it has so much utility for helping new players that ask for it, and we don't have to explain to them that they need to link every piece of armor, trinket, and weapon they're using in chat. We shouldn't allow bad actors to hamstring us.
---
- Add the stats added with HoT to the search options in the TP.
---
- Add the ability to search the TP for locked skins.
---
- Even if you never update dungeons again, please remove the awful game breaking bugs.
---
- If the Attributes section would actually tell me how much of my stats come from gear specifically, and what that accomplishes. I don't mean what it does, it already tells me that. I mean I want to know what percentage of damage is negated by armor. Because I'm not sure the armor value precisely describes damage blocked. For instance, Vitality scales by a factor of 10, to +63 vitality translates to +630 health. What does 1000 armor translate to? Same is true to for stuff like precision or expertise - what does that mean?
---
- Toggle for the effects of legendary trinkets on my character, and on other characters.
---
- Many of the story achievements are incredibly unfun. They feel extremely tedious and partially up to chance. It would be more tolerable if we could skip dialogue or go straight to specific missions. But we can't.
---
- Pipe dream: something like the WoW mod Total RP 3. Where you can write a brief character profile, and include immediately noticeable features about the character. Would facilitate organic, unplanned RP - which is the best kind IMO.
---
As far as actual content suggestions go.
---
- Please add a legendary armor that is acquired solely through open world content. Map metas, events, whatever. But that would give me something I'd actually be able to earn (I don't raid or PVP often), and it would help to revitalize old content. You could do one armor set for each expansion and subsequent LWS. So say, HoT and S3 zones dropped stuff relevant for crafting the light armor. PoF could do the medium armor, and so on. I split it because I think it might be unreasonable to have to buy every expac and every LWS to earn any single legendary set.
---
- More legendary trinkets pls.
---
- New races. They could be added in an expac or in a LWS. They could do old story content by using the same tech which transforms the player character into Charr in the ascalon fractal. This avoids loads of rewriting, voice acting for a new commander doing old story, and so on. That saves an enormous amount of effort, but there's still an enormous amount of effort found in making all the assets necessary.
---
You are referring to the form, I am referring to the functionality.
---
It has the movement speed of a skimmer, the 2 endurance bar of a raptor, the movement distance of a jackal when using the movement skill.
---
there is a guild hall for merchant access, passes are simply convience
---
No. I want BDO’s.
---
Change them,
---
If you consider PvP and WvW endgame content, which I do as a competitive game mode player, then Mirage most certainly has a role here.
---
It is still one of the best roaming classes and is very good for havoc groups (small-medium size + highly mobile groups). In PvP, Mirage is still quite good despite the swing towards a current bunker meta.
---
username checks out. “xd”
---
I'm invoking poe's law before I start this.  
---
No.  It looks beyond stupid.  The reason for this is because there was no way devs were gonna model so many different models just for one race.  In the end the charr get the short end of the stick, that's FINE.  
---
But if there's one thing I detest in games is that people come up with vague reasons that excuse mistakes or otherwise inconsistencies in game design or lore.  98% of the game models were designed before POF was released, and the prevalence of mounts was never important to the game nor the story of the game, so any *real* connection to it is hot garbage.
---
I have not found anything about not turning on the game
---
Probably solely because it's a very rare drop. I have done Yidaxu at least a dozen times and haven't gotten nor seen anyone paste it in squad chat like they normally do when getting a rare drop.
---
&gt; I think ArenaNet overestimates how good the story is for the game.
---
If I'm being completely honest, I feel like it often serves to drag the game down. Especially when story achievements mean that I have to play the story for an achievement cosmetic I want.
---
I hate to sound like a dick, and I feel sympathetic to the writers because I can imagine how many constraints they're working within - what themes they can explore, how much they can actually write due to VA limitations and not trying to choke game flow, trying to enable player choice while maintaining depth, having to work fast, and more. But I honestly really, really dislike the story. And for a game that emphasizes the story as such a selling point, I feel like it doesn't deliver. But I'll be the first to admit that I have very high standards.
---
The writing has improved dramatically, I'll say that. Character writing has gotten better. I think the writing is actually at its strongest when they try to be funny. Moments of drama or gravitas usually fail to elicit much of a response from me because they feel either generic, too over the top, or I have no emotional investment in the characters. The degree of predictability also hurts it.
---
A more specific critique would have to be done on a case by case, scene by scene basis. But in general I think that they'd probably be able to write a much better story if they tossed player agency out the window and did a Bioshock Infinite. We already know there are a loads of Tyrias and loads of Commanders - that servant of Grenth explained as much when the Commander died. So giving the commander a set personality, or making their dialogue choices completely irrelevant, could enable the team to explore a lot of interesting existential ideas about fate, and could help emulate a feeling normally relegated to classical epics like the Odyssey, Illiad, Aenied, or Mahabharata. Those feel, well... epic.
---
Alternatively, the direction could be moved to primarily comedy. I think it would be less of a tone shift from the majority of content, though the story has gotten pretty dark more recently.
---
&gt;And I also think there's a mix of naivety/arrogance in believing that the GW2 story could and should be compared to what "your favorite shows" writers are doing out there.
---
Video games can deliver amazing stories, with amazing experiences that can't be replicated in another medium.
---
It's just that they rarely do.
---
I've got about 300 games in my steam library, and only a handful of them stick out as being well written. I think because in the end, there's a much greater focus on gameplay and less focus on mating the story and gameplay, or building the world and characters in conjunction with the gameplay.
---
In my experience as a player, the games that I remember for having the best stories were generally passion projects made by small studios which had a very clear idea of what they wanted, and were few enough in number that it was easy for everyone to be on the same page. Art, music, writing, and gameplay all bouncing ideas off one another and trying to make everything they work on individually play into the work of the rest of the team. Those holistic experiences where every aspect of the gameplay, the world, the story plays into the rest and feels flush or seamless - that's amazing.
---
I don't know if a large team like GW2 has, especially one split up into different story teams, can do an instanced single player narrative in a way that feels worth paying much attention to. Average or inconsistent writing doesn't hold my attention.
---
Strange, all of them can be traded except that one?
---
Please make a screenshot as soon as you want, so I can update the wiki accordingly \^\^.
---
Hi! Welcome back to GW2 :)
---
There is such a lot to do/see in GW2 it can be overwhelming, for sure. I guess the biggest thing is to just put the ol' feelers out, and access what you're up for on the day. GW2 seems pretty open like that. We're not really forced into doing any one particular thing. Thank goodness. 
---
Regarding gold makers... this really depends what you're wanting to save up for? What modes you enjoy (PvE/PvP/WvW) could determine how you make gold.  
---
100% superspeed uptime isn't particularly helpful in large groups, it means anyone who is separated from tag will likely get picked off and killed as they can't catch back up. Ideally you want it when pushing and mid-push, 3 gyros provides that functionality nicely =D
---
    
---
Mecha legs is a waste, as I described in the video, because conditions don't last longer than 1-2s anyways and you always have swiftness from converting cripple. Blast finishers cause a 2k heal, it's affected by outgoing healing and reverberates off you with MDF. It's free healing sitting on the table, kind of a no brainer.
---
     
---
1k barrier vs 50% faster healing is also a no brainer. -condi damage taken is useless, they only tick 1-2 times and there are no meta condi builds. 
---
   
---
Boons get stripped or corrupted long before they reach full duration, so more concentration is a waste. While overhealing spreads to any target in range, the faster your party hits full health, the faster you can spillover to other parties.
---
Comeback cure accounts for 30-40% of your healing, you soak the zerg in regen. It's crazy not to take something that strong man, regardless of your group size. It's also free padding against corrupts 
---
then follow this https://github.com/megai2/d912pxy/wiki/Reporting-crashes
---
Oh god no, what are you on. Aion is fucking ancient
---
Because making assets is hard.  When ANet started modeling the races they couldn't possibly account for every single variation of armor so Charr get the short end of the stick when it comes to content design.  Half the outfits in the game Charr only get the male version; egalitarianess aside, that's literally half the variation that other races get between the two sexes.
---
It's one thing to have similarly styled armor/designs because of similar morphology or to outright acknowledge the limitations.  
---
It's another to handwave it and be like "because lore!!!"  No, it's because Charr are generally an unpopular race (according to the stats) so less work literally gets put into them.  And then it creates a cyclical spiral where they're not popular because they don't look good so less work goes into their content, so they don't have as much appeal, rinse and repeat.  However the Charr still in general look alright, but their options are definitely more limited than most other races.  Who would have thought, that the race that doesn't look humanoid looks pretty mediocre in most humanoid armor/equipment.  
---
My biggest gripe with GW2 is the lack of interesting build diversity, visual class identity and a proper cosmetics end game.  Let's take a look at gw1 as a case study and start with class identity.  Each class had not only their own class specific armor sets, but their own casting animations.  Playing a necro visually felt different from playing a mesmer or elementalist or monk.  You felt like you represented your class and could really get lost in its aesthetic.  At a glance, you could tell what someone else class was without them ever using a skill.  In gw2 all cast animations are the same.   Many skill animations are shared across different classes, minus some particle effect flourish.  In WvW, if I see a clothie just running at me I cannot tell what class they are.  Same with plates and leather.
---
Let's go on to build diversity.  Talents are boring.   They're hidden modifiers with passive effects that just add numbers here and there.  Again, if a Warrior casts a weapon skill on me, that doesn't reveal what his talent tree is.  There's no visual feedback for talents.  Additionally, talent trees dont really change how weapon sets feel.  If they do its marginal.  A sword and board warrior will play and act roughly the same no matter his talent tree.  Gw1 had sealed deck style skill bars.  Seeing one or two skills you could take a proper guess at what the bar was.  A sword and board warrior with hundred blades acted and played differently than a cripslash.  Gw2s locked weapon system is bunk.  I've yet to find a weapon combination on any class where I like and have fun using every skill.  Usually the set I use is the one that has the least amount of clunky and unfun skills.  In gw1 each expansion came with hundreds of cool skills and new bud combinations, both team and personal.  Gw2 expansions show up with a wet fart, one or two extra maps, some middling new drops and practically no fucking updates to skills.  One time we all got to use an extra weapon on our classes.   One time.  One time we got one new specialization.  One time we got one class.  That's it.  Everything else stayed the same.
---
Lastly the cosmetics end game.   Where are all the cool and unique armor sets and weapons to chase?  Oh yeah, the fucking gem store.   This was frankly the reason I eventually quit.  I have each expansion a fair shake, and end genuinely excited about what cook armor and weapon stuff there would be to chase.  Only to be greeted by a few half assed and ugly skins that drop with all the really cool shit coming from gem store items.  Gw1 had multiple sets of elite armors PER CLASS with a large variety in how each looked, and none of them were cash shop bullshit.  Hell I still play gw1 to this day because there's still cool looking shit for me to chase and it's all reasonably obtainable.  None of this 2 year grind for tiny amounts of gold to then just buy what you need.  Every piece of gear worth obtaining drops from another a location mob or dungeon chest or is traded for at a collector with dungeon rewards.
---
Gw2 is a game broken and flawed at a fundamental level.  
---
Hybrid scourge hasn't been worth running since they nerfed dhummfire tbh, barrier has terrible healing power scaling and a 2s torment on each shade skill is not worth dumping Stat points into.  You'll get much better results from a straight power scourge build, marauder/berserker with knights/cavalier as needed
---
Squad of 15 is not a good idea. You want players to learn the bosses, you need to keep the 10 player squad.
---
Easy mode raids only need a stat boost for the players, or a small stat nerf for the bosses. That's all of it.
---
Thanks. Another question. If I buy path of fire does it automatically unlock heart of thorns or how does that work? The shop doesn't explain it very well
---
There's a charr in LA wearing [Common Town clothes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Common_Clothing_Outfit) and [Iron's Tailpipe Bandana](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Iron%27s_Tailpipe_Bandana), so don't tell me it isn't.
---
Only MMO which I have significantly more time than GW2 is City of Heroes/Villains, which died back in 2012.
---
OH THE AGONY TOO SOON etc
---
Of course, PvP on CoH was near non-existent because the game wasn't really built for it so it never really worked properly and was always on the to-do list but no priority, haha.
---
Player retention is always good for the men in suit.
---
I also want to try this addon since the Alpha but i cannot give up with the radial so..
---
Really? Windows 7? In 2019?
---
The core game is f2p and were you level your character as everybody else do. You will be able to level to max level and play the core endgame content that we did the first 3 years. This means you have plenty of time to decide if you want to buy the game or not. 
---
Your restrictions will be character slots, bag slot, no access to map chat and whisper restrictions. The one that hurts the most is the limited restrictions to the trading post. It will only give you access to basice material so you wont be able to sell or buy what you want. 
---
You will also not have access to racial towns until lvl 10, Lions Arch the main hub at lvl 35 and WvW until lvl 60. You wont be able to level a revenant nor will you have access to any of the content related to each expac. 
---
After all the bugs I experience with the guild bank back in the day, I think it would probably be easier to just remake the whole guild system from scratch.
---
I'm still leading every week. Things turned well until tonight. 2nd failure. Maybe because of St Patrick's. 25 people was of course a too small squad.
---
Until the 31th march i'll keep the tag up. Every saturday and every sunday 20:30 utc. After that, SAB will be available and summer-hour change will change my schedule. But i'll tell you hear when i'll lead.
---
There was the exact same thread just yesterday. 
---
I’m only here cause someone in chat said it was on reddit 🤫
---
Archeage was the perfect mmo for me but lost cause due to the bad management. Sigh.
---
ESO was fun for a while but gw2 is so good :)
---
\+1 
---
=)
---
We're all saying that 
---
I'm pretty sad hardcore world bosses were abandoned pretty much after they were released. We only got Tequatl and Triple Trouble, almost five years ago, and that's it.
---
O how i love to hear the desperate cry of those that in there heart know that the game is going to die but will make any excuse to avoid the reality.  The higher ups took away 50% of the resources the game had, they just want to make a quick buck while guild wars 2 dies slowly
---
For me it's the combat animations, that snd of course balance. Like the auto proc BS making TTK ridiculous. 
---
I've put a lot of hours into ESO and their version of WvW. It's a fun beautiful game but it also has it's own issues and depending on what your goals are its can be fun. Its been around a year since I've played though. 
---
I would say it's more the perfectly smooth skin from what I can see. No wrinkles or lines, no blemishes, no stubble on the guys. Those do not look like the faces of somebody that has many years of life behind them.
---
&gt; I would like ANet to add a PvE reward track that is tracked through experience points.
---
Completely agree, been saying it for a while. Remove the map participation system, and replace it with PvE reward tracks, locked to each map, so you can only progress there.
---
That way you're rewarded for playing the map, not just farming the meta event.
---
???
---
I don't mind the cadence, 2h would be fine too, just like WvW skirmishes.
---
It's a good opportunity to get some Deathmatch and Stronghold going strong in Unranked.
---
Funny you say that, because the content we're getting now keeps players engaged for a few hours, and then they leave again. Half my guildmates log in to unlock and play the story, then leave again.
---
You don't need a constant stream of new content to keep the players active in the game.
---
So I've been doing this for a while, and it works if you have enough tomes/scrolls and do content that replenishes or mitigates significant loss of these items per week. Level 60 key runs, which gives 2 extra keys per week. By the end of it, you end up getting boosters and Sigil of Nullification. It takes an extra few hours, but if you've got the Roller Beetle and do the right story steps, you're cutting down a ton of time and making use of essentially useless items. I can elaborate if anyone is interested (it's not all that complicated, just more optimization necessary), but it requires a few extra hours a week.
---
Level 40 and level 60 both give Black Lion keys.
---
i did 20x 100 cm with slippery,didnt died single time,its a gimick which fuck up your movement and skills,which have no place in ANY online game,since LAG is still present which by itself makes your movement laggy and than you get used to it and next fractal BOOM,no slipery. its just retarded/dumb/annoing,its not hard.
---
Mesmer needs GS for pChrono 36k awesomeness (Domination build)
---
That is when I left as well. There is a lot I liked about SWTOR including the pvp but the gear changes was a step too far. They flipped the pvp gear strat from being easy to get on an even playing field back to champ bags style. It was frustrating and a ridiculous move for pvpers.
---
Unless you play Power Chronomancer DPS with Domination
---
Raid? I don't know. [PvP however...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWQKiefZ-XI)
---
They do. But why are they buying the keys? Cus they saw someone with something cool from the chest, they saw an ad, they saw something in game. If the person isn't in the game, they can't buy keys. Someone who makes key runs and gets a rad item, will use it, others will see it and buy keys. The invisible hand 
---
i'm trying to collect info on actual speedup with &gt;1 threads cause this can be overshoot. when there more then 1 thread flickering can occur for now.
---
For the fucking umpteenth time, Anet will tell you info about any upcoming expansion WHEN THEY ARE FUCKING READY TO DO SO.
---
##**STOP BEGGING FOR UPDATES FFS!!**
---
bad bot
---
&gt; I also think that the only chance this game has right now would be some sort of content revamp instead of developing content like they have been doing in the last 2-3 years. We know that the game will have more developers working on it, but I believe that this won't make a huge difference unless they come up with radical decisions.
---
Glad to see I'm not the only one who sees the writing in the wall.
---
&gt;Another thing that makes me pessimistic about the future of the game is that the people who are responsible for making decisions related to development of the game are still keeping their positions. It must be pretty obvious to everyone that when they started to plan LS4/LS5 they made a lot of bad decisions. I mean they have decided that they wanted to increase the quality of story episodes and introduce expansion-level stories KNOWING that they would have only half the amount of developers working on GW2? Sometimes I think these people are actually insane. But yet, they are where they were before. And I don't believe that they will force radical changes that GW2 needs.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I'm just sad that this game was hindered by certain people.
---
GW2 was such a great foundation back in 2012... then everything went into the wrong direction :(.
---
You really nailed it with this assessment. The story isn’t horrible by any stretch but it isn’t particularly memorable or good. As a result, it has a tough time competing for my limited time. 
---
This game was strongest to me when focused on small team content. I think I’ve gotten all I can out of what the game offers in that regard. Over time the story updates have been sitting unplayed in my que. 
---
If I need player I just tag up (turn on the lamp) and people follow me like a moth. I only care about stats and I get trinkets from LWS3 and armor+weapons from raids.
---
Will increase participation tier but more importantly you will have something fun to do instead of just being afk. 
---
Sorry noob question but what does it mean by 'use at your own risk'? We won't get banned for using it or does it mean the files on your PC?
---
I'd really like to see the names of those who downvote this.
---
Yeah, they should go for the easier solutions first before pulling the big guns like overhauls. Don't get me wrong, it would be good if say we got updated dungeons etc but thats just not going to happen anytime soon.
---
Would be nice but I don't really think it's necessary, no.
---
As a PvP player i wouldn't see any difference.
---
&gt;You guys also think that the transmutation charges should be change to infinite.
---
No I don't? Your choice in punctuation might be misleading too.
---
