I can imagine it:
---

---
* Replace the run to the boss with 3 platforms, have a leviathan and a jade elemental mini-bosses on he way to the boss platform. The leviathan would teach you hot to deal with the Maw's tentacles, to dodge the sweeping attacks and such, the jade elemental to deal with the Colossi. 
---
* Then at the boss, instead spawning many Jade Colossi, there would be alternating tentacles and jade colossi in phases that can go much faster if the party is skilled.
---
* The first phase would have just a champion Jade Colossus.
---
  * Whenever the jade colossus' defiance bar breaks and whenever it loses 10% of its health, it will  summon 5 small weak jade elementals.
---
  * These jade elementals are weaker than normal fractal enemies and easy to kill, and when they are killed, they will do a Last Laugh explosion and spawn a reflection crystal. Reflection crystals can be used to gain a special action skill that replaces the old reflection crystal and an effect that works like a one time aegis against the maw's beam. (More on what this skill does ahead). 
---
  * Shortly after the fist wave of small jade elementals spawns, the Jade Maw would start attacking with its beam attack, but instead being a targeted flimsy wiggly line, it would be like the attack it does at the end and in the cinematic, but focused in a pattern instead covering the whole area. This attack can be avoided with invulnerability and moving out of the way, and players who have a shard will survive a hit, but they will lose the shard. 
---
  * When the champion jade colossus is defeated, it runs to a spot by the jade wall under the Jade maw, and 'turn' into "Jade formation". Well, it would actually just die there and the jade formation appears in its place, but a green smoke explosion like those that appear when tentacles spawn would be used to hide the change between the colossus corpse and the jade formation. 
---
      * At T4, the jade colossus would be able to cast Jade Winds on players for massive damage and several stacks of Agony, this can be interrupted by breaking its defiance bar. 
---
      * In challenge mode, the Jade Winds can't be evaded or blocked, only breaking the defiance bar and invulnerability can prevent it. 
---
* The second  phase would have 2 champion tentacles and a second Jade Colossus, this time a weaker veteran version, spreading the player's damage and attention. 
---
  * From now own, whenever a Jade Colossus dies, another spawns in its place. This weaker jade colossus also has a defiance bar, but weaker, and also spawns jade elementals  when its defiance bar breaks or 10% health is lost. 
---
  * The current jade colossus would periodically fixate on a target, giving priority to whoever has been killing more jade colossi and jade elementals. 
---
  * The champion tentacles will each have an ability that will summon many irukandji if they complete the activation. The only way to prevent that will be breaking their defiance bars or killing them. They won't use this ability while their defiance bars are recovering, so it is best to keep all their bars broken or the place will be teeming with irukandji. 
---
  * At T4, If all tentacles manage to complete their summon of irukandji, a champion giant irukandji would also be spawned. This one won't drop any extra rewards, it would only slow the party down. So it may be better to focus on one of the tentacles than spreading between all if your party can't deal with all fast enough. 
---
 * In challenge mode, the defiance bar would have a rougher scaling. 
---
 * Killing each tentacle will take a portion of the Maw's health. After both tentacles are dead, the maw will be left with 50% health. 
---
* In the 3rd phase the a weaker colossus keeps spawning, and several small tentacles appear randomly. These tentacles would cripple allies deal little damage, being mostly a nuisance, but damaging thems won't damage the maw, they'll go invulnerable and hide undeground. 
---
 So, how do we damage the maw now? 
---
 * Reflection crystals will be renamed to Jade Shards. And now Instead giving a bundle when picked and getting a skill when hit by the maw, they give an effect.
---
       * The effect gives an special action skill, replaces the character's back with a Jade Shard back and makes players 1-time immune to the Jade Maw beam (like a specializaed aegis), but the effect and the action skill are lost if a jade maw beam hits you. This back will also be a skin reward for completing the Jade Maw's Challenge Mode.
---
       *  The special action skill is a ground targeted skill that can be used on enemies to deal 50% defiance bar damage (just in case you don't have enough CC to break the tentacle bars), or on the "Jade Formation" to transfer its magic to it. 
---
       * This formation is basically a series of Jade blocks on the jade wall were the Jaw Maw is trapped that will be slowly grow and move up as jade shards are thrown at it. The more shards players throw on it, the larger it gets. 
---
       * When enough jade shards have been thrown into the formation, the current veteran colossus will run to it and explode. No more colossi will spawn, and the jade formation will be finally completed with the missing steps between blocks that will spawn behind the green smoke of the explosion. 
---
   * Players can now climb the jade blocks and fight the Jade Maw directly by attacking its neck, but it will defend itself spawning tentacles horizontally from the wall. The higher the fractal tier, the more would spawn, from 2 at T1 to 8 at T4. It is possible to attack these tentacles, but killing them does little damage to the maw, so they can be ignored if you can can learn to time your dodges to avoid their attacks, and focus on the maw, or they can be killed to be safe but slower.
---
* When the maw's health is finally 0, the jade formation begins to crumble and players must hurry to get off it. It will explode into several Jade Shards are scattered over the platform, and the Jade Maw will do its classic final attack that covers the entire area. Players have to hurry and grab a shard to survive. 
---
Of course, the [Irukandji ](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veteran_Irukandji "Irukandji ")gotta get changed to use the [Rainbow Jellyfish](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Juvenile_Rainbow_Jellyfish "Rainbow Jellyfish") models instead a wind rider mode. They look nothing like [the actual ones](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Irukandji "the actual ones").

Let's hope it eventually happens:

Gee maybe if anet regularly held XP events in WvW we'd not have a playerbase issue. If you think a mount is going to magically fix the declining player base of what's effectively an abandoned game mode (until the patch that redefines a world comes out in 4 years) that's just optimism I even think is silly.
---
The declining mode has come from a lot of things, and, for many, it's just not a fun mode anymore because popular PvE requests just don't pan out in the competitive environment. 
---
Best we'll get is a surplus for the duration of people getting the mount, and, depending on how much it impacts the gameplay, may end up with a worse situation.
---
Depends on how easy it's going to be to force dismount someone. If there's a chance that breakbar of mount charr is not going to be insta destroyed with 3 basi venom hits, there's a chance we'll finally get a goblet filled with gank thieves and mirages squad's tears. 
---
That'd be glorious, though I'm not holding my breath.
---
You're just extrapolating too much from that statement.  I'm not saying the match *belongs* to anyone, but not realizing that a new player's learning playground is also another player's competitive match is very narrow-minded and short-sighted.  My point was to highlight that people who main-play WvW put in a lot of time and effort for the team, and they can feel frustrated when new players don't take the time to learn and thereby trample on or disregard the effort that dedicated players have put in.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
It's not about the right to be toxic, it's just that it's wrong to be toxic and I believe we both agree that how a person expresses themselves is very, very important when it comes to communicating your expectations for your allies.  Being toxic is not only unproductive but unnecessarily and potentially hurtful.
---
&gt; If you play WvW, you have to live with the fact that others might have different goals then you have. 
---
Absolutely, all goes really are the same goal though - team success. How we do it or which activities that lead to that depend no the individual player.  I don't want to muddy the waters here.  It's more that there is a productive way to communicate and thus work together or a toxic way to divide people.
---
Great counter. Hats off to you.
---
you see yourself as a veteran, but tbh that does not mean that you aren't a casual player.  
---
even playing much does not get you out of the casual branding in gw2.
---
Follow up post after doing some digging into the matter, and some tips for contacting support for OP and everyone else reading this:
---
1) The ticket definitely isn't deleted, and appears to have been submitted normally. Our agents also replied to it, as they normally would, earlier today, so we're not entirely sure where things are going wrong in this case.
---
2) Make sure to always submit your ticket using the email connected to your game account. If you're contacting us about the game account on myaccount@email.com, don't contact us from myaccount2@email.com.
---
3) Since it seems that we did reply... Double check, triple check, that our replies aren't going into your spam folder, and maybe add our support site email to your contacts!
---
True. 
---
But told this way: It makes me want to avoid WvW. I'm noob, not stupid or five years old. ;-)
---
Your advices are not really advices because it's easy to know these things only with roaming. Maybe you could welcome new players in WvW in a more friendly way. 
---
...and casuals too.
---
What's the best and/or easiest way (method or profession) to unlock bloodstone bricks? Like should I farm for gold to just buy my way to 400 or is there a decent way to farm materials directly? Have a grow lamp and light source, need the bricks for the backpack thing.
---
I'll edit in a few minutes with my profession levels for which is closest. 
---
As in "more difficult to kill unsuspecting victim"?
---
You can't mount in combat anyway. 
---
I mean, as long as you aren't doing anything to provoke them, ya, reporting them is a good choice.
---
"First I was afraid, I was petrified..."
---
You're the proof i'm right. Cantha confirmed. XD 
---
Especially since it isn't just adding new players. My guild already struggles to make sure we get everyone on map, but now we're going to throw in a bunch of players gridinding their mounts? People that have loved and committed time to playing WvW are going to get blocked off map sitting in queues so a bunch of people can come get their shiny new toy.
---
I might have missed it, but I didn't see all the bird memes and complaints with the fractal update get quarantined to one topic.
---
&gt; they are really mad because i jump on there bodies in wvw
---
Big think.
---
I know right! Super surprised by it been helpful so far
---
I run a bunker Druid just for fun does because I got tired of playing a meta soul beast, and it’s worked out great.
---
Being in voice wasn't really directed at veterans, but at the newbs. I am 100% guilty of spending some days out of voice. But we both know what's going on and I assume we both die very little. I also assume you know how to play your class and when to place stuff like wells/veils in WvW, but thats's something R10 PvE players likely wouldn't know. They just don't have the experience we do.
---
I learned how to play WvW well in voice, and the coms shouldn't need to type calls out for people amidst everything else. I really started enjoying WvW after getting into voice- I got better just listening.
---
If the coms being obnoxious or toxic they can leave, but I'd give voice a chance for new players. Being able to hear the calls and move with the group usually increases survivability and less time dead is a better experience I would think?
---
ArenaNet have been stealing from my wardrobe it seems.
---
Proud hardcore casual here. Never raided, done T4 fractals only once. Mostly just do dailies, all the event stuff, open world metas, play in starter maps and help people, do all the new story content and whatever else is added. Have dabbled in PvP and WvW mainly for skins but basically just do whatever I feel like doing. I have no real desire to raid ever, spent enough time being miserable with groups in Destiny raids, though I kinda want to do the mystic forge one. 
---
Account value of 69,445 gold right now (giggity) and just passed 16,000 achievement points. I've made 3 legendaries and will make 1-2 more when LWS4E6 comes out depending on what the greatsword looks like. I have commander+catmander tags and lead open world metas pretty often. 2400 hours played over 9 characters and 15 days away from my 4th birthday. To me that seems fairly hardcore for the time I've had played but yeah I'm not into anything competitive and basically play nothing of the true end-game. True casual player that just really enjoys the casual things to do.
---
This looks amazing, OP. Very nice work!
---
Ah yes you’re right, I apologize for the rant. I just find it strange how some people don’t see it the same way when I’m sure everyone who play the game and own PoF have done it.
---
The earlier problems are debated, the more likely they get fixed.
---
After many devs hours were spent it's a bit too late. Ideally stuff as this mount is debated when it's still a concept.
---
Nope. It’s more trash than before. 
---
This. I came back in December after 3 years off, and all my ascended gear (and legendaries) were still all I needed, so I could jump back into any content I felt like. I really like that part about the game.
---
You have a choice to leave WvW if you are too casual and will whine about being left out.
---
Yea definitely agree 100%.  Admittedly my comms rant wasn't entirely directed at you but just instigated by you haha.
---
Sheepskin doublet my good man
---
What do you do for that much gold?
---
Is there any up to date guides in tp flipping?
---
For everyone else they’re embroidered pants. For me they’re *malign* embroidered pants
---
If they get married and later divorced remember to get custody of the golem to Seti as i don't trust Ixxi because of his Inquest past. He can keep the brats.
---
Same here really, i prefer to be an MMO loner who does group content as a side thing. part of me wishes anet adds a sort of quest system that's not hearts. i know GW2 vowed to not do crappy generic MMO quests but they also said no mounts. but when they did mounts they were much better than other MMO's
---
So they could probably do something interesting with quests. Especially repeatable ones.
---
Yeah sorry I was definitely referring to ranked. But no I totally agree, I've been trying my hardest to learn/master weaver just to give myself the challenge I guess. They have so much power and an extremely large toolkit, why the hell do they have no place? It's such a weird situation that in trying to figure out. 
---
It's cool I got that feeling. ;) I just had to go to class after that post and your comment gave me an easy out to getting the rest of it off my chest lmao.
---
Just want to add that if any new player sees a class that they are getting kicked for in squad, it's because that player has earned the right to play that class.
---
Like mentioned above, some of us have quite some sway in how commander treats us, like no voice coms but still in squad. Even tag that you have will affect how commander sees you (well known wvw guild people never get kicked intentionaly).
---
I wonder why after the new map fiasco ;(
---
You know what, I kind of agree with your original post. It does feel a bit that way to me.
---
But you really have to stop with the “” and fake sentences you put inside them. It’s not good for you. Learn to explain how you feel and don’t use fictional voices.
---
Knowing full well there’s not a chance they can wrap up all the dragons while doing them justice.
---
Nah, self-conscious bad players need an excuse. There are people who don't judge their merits in life in a video game and don't make excuses. There are things I'm bad at, because I'm bad at them and that's okay. Not everyone is going to be good at everything. I'm a fine writer and a lousy artist. So what?
---
upgrade to a full account you harlot
---
Bring a healer if you can. Bring dps classes with cleave and focus on mob management when they spawn before returning to the boss.
---
Projectile absorbs are great, but only last so long.
---
Having a bunch of power Quickbrands is great for this.
---
Not yet, most of the benefits are for higher levels and my character is still in the 20s
---
Other legendaries? You can get the legendary backpack, armor, accessories, and other legendary weapons. 
---
I've been saying to my bf for a while, that dungeons should be made soloable. Faster/easier with a group.
---
t1: you get these from [reward tracks](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Armor_Reward_Track).
---
t2: can be purchased from the skirmishing vendor after unlocking the t1 version. ascended versions of these can already be upgraded to legendary.
---
t3: can be purchased from the skirmishing vendor after unlocking the t2 version and reaching significantly high ranks. these can also be upgraded to legendary rarity.
---
*Woah!* It's your **4th Cakeday** Malyszeq! ^(hug)
---
Raids and starting with WvW as firebrand.
---
[Triumphant Armor Reward Track](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Armor_Reward_Track) (complete 6 times for 1 of 3 sets of [Triumphant armor])(https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_armor) -&gt; [Triumphant Hero's armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Hero%27s_armor) (purchased from vendor) -&gt; [Mistforged Triumphant Hero's armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mistforged_Triumphant_Hero%27s_armor) (purchased from vendor with high world rank)
---
Both Triumphant Hero's armor and Mistforged Triumphant Hero's armor can be upgraded to Legendary rarity.
---
Do a decent dps (which also means a decent boon uptime), spam projectile negation and bring some minor condition clear for burning to negate instability. Took 12 minutes today with a pug.
---
Take a break until you are inspired to play again? If I feel like I'm not getting anything out of a game (this one or any other one) I just stop playing. I don't really see a point to logging in and forcing yourself to play something if you've lost interest in.
---
Imagine spending more than 1 week max every 3 months on open world pve
---
HoT was released before Overwatch, too bad.
---
What happened to ACs?
---
Should be a basic track you can find, unlike the dungeon/living story ones which require doing the story mode/section to unlock the first time. Just scroll down the list of available/unlocked tracks you have.
---
So we kill adds then go to DPS boss? We don't try to cleave adds around the boss?
---
you select them in your WvW menu (the little castle icon)  
---
the third tab (the chest icon) is the reward tracks; select the Triumphant Armor Track from the list; set it to repeat; and play the game mode :)
---
You too
---
You must be selectively blind.
---
I loved that aspect of B&amp;S. I always wanted something like that in GW2.
---
I know that gw2 is very group focused, but to have a designed place for solo try harding is needed in every game.
---
Most likely with next Living Story episode release.  So a month or two from now?
---
Let's be real though, we see a lot of positivity alongside negativity with PvE changes. Do you see the subreddit right after every living world episode release? Beaming with praise and positive discussion. When any trailer is released? Hype and anticipation.
---
But with WvW, every time something is announced, people will hate the change before it even comes in. If it turns out to be good, it's not mentioned or praised ever. If it turns out to be bad, it's used as an example for WvW rants.
---
Of course, WvW doesn't get nearly as many updates and attention as PvE, and like many others I also don't fully agree with some of their balance decisions and design choices for WvW.
---
But the constant complaining and hate that comes from the WvW community is certainly not *entirely* due to the fact that it's a game mode that gets less attention. Many WvW players in general are so cynical about everything, and this is incredibly destructive to the game mode. The fact that it's also a player vs player game mode means that emotions run higher, toxicity is bred, and positive outlooks are not nearly as common as they should be.
---
Constructive criticism is great. Hating on changes before they come in, stating that ArenaNet abandoned the game mode as if it's fact, and just being salty and destructive with all your criticism helps nobody.
---
I'm pretty new to the game but I asked some people who've been around since 2013 if gliding was considered nearly as big of an issue and they told me that Anet had to redo the maps and adjust structures/environment because gliding allowed people to get where they shouldn't be. "Wait, gliding did break the game, then Anet had to resize all the structures and change distances to unbreak it". The people that were around for the gliding fiasco are expecting it to happen again and are tired of the shit state of the meta on top of it. I'm not surprised that the reaction has been what it is.
---
Like the deceased Maize farm?
---
"Switching to holo mo..OH SHIT"
---
Hi daddy
---
Definitely possible. Though asking me to kite the guard or disengage it might have gone over better imo.
---
Cite any personal attacks then, not denying there may have been some but I haven't seen them so its not widespread.
---
Well, the issue with balancing difficulty to be about the same regardless of group size is that it makes groups very volatile.
---
For now a raid for instance is balanced around 10 players. You can do it with less but even if the additional player has bad damage he is still a benefit (provided he manages the fight mechanically).
---
If you can just do an easier raid with 9 persons, you will kick the least contributive person in order to optimize the time / rewards ratio. And before you realize it all the best players go solo, then all the new-best and so on. You'll only have groups left of people unable to solo (so groups of players you don't want).
---
Even if it does not devolve to that, I would wager that most of the time the hassle of finding another player alone would be much higher than a meager 1% loot. Even 10% more loot may not do.
---
Of course, the whole 'get people to group up to do something difficult in a game' may be a thing of the past.
---
It pairs two servers together every two months. The results usually result in imbalanced matches for at least a couple of weeks. 
---
So true man, so true. 
---
To be fair, no one can roast our game mode better than we do daily.
---
Yeah, some classes are just designed with more than others I guess. Hopefully itll get worked into a better spot without destroying everything else
---
Transfer to the less populous servers
---
Years ago these servers had queues during Primetime all the way down to the bottom few. Now you have wasteland even when you really have 4-6 servers in a single match.
---
Are you following?
---
99% of the time it just looks like a glossy silver blob. Just warning others so they don't make the same mistake I did.
---
You can do either/or. I think the adds spawn based on the boss's health, though, so if you cleave down the boss too fast, adds may spawn faster than you can take care of them. Aim for the pace that keeps you alive.
---
Rub one out before you PvP
---
At the same time, there ARE issues. WvW guilds are gaming the system and turning it into cancer. BlackGate and Yaks Bend are stacking massive numbers against other realms who can't field enough people to even pretend that it was going to be a fair fight. Stop giving links to servers that don't need them. They need to look at the wvw population rather than PVE population. Lets not even bother listing all of the stealth trolling going on these days.   
---
It's nice to see the devs adding something to WvW regardless of the issues. It's not like we're not having fun.  
---
beautiful.. sleek and effective
---
To be exact, here's the time necessary to reach T3 assuming 0 Yaks are killed, 0 Yaks are flipped and 0 sentries are taken.  Also, no guild upgrades or player-given swiftness.

If even one person kills yaks/flips camps, most objectives will take upwards of 6 hours to upgrade to T3 even with a similar number of people working to get Yaks in.  If the Yakslapper is even a little slippery and skilled enough to flip camps in less than 45 seconds (which is not hard), no objective should upgrade in under 12 hours without a lopsided defense team babysitting it.  
---
The issue is not the auto-upgrades--they are functionally identical to the old system if the upgrading scout used a timer.  The issue is that people don't understand how powerful supply denial is.  If one person logs on and can't find a zerg, they log off.  Ideally, roamers should deny supply as it leads to solo/small-scale fights.  Likewise, defensive players should know that slapping the Yakslappers is a huge boon to the server.  But, instead, most people just zerg or troll around looking for meaningless fights.  They're entitled to do that if they please, but then they shouldn't complain about things getting upgraded.
---
What the 50 man all on the same mount doing the same skills under immense lag meta? Can't wait! 
---
inb4 rank 3000 requirement to get one lol
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **2nd Cakeday** SonjaNachtbringer! ^(hug)
---
Ugh I know...look at that clipping.
---
My Warrior, Ranger, Thief &amp; Elementalist are all caught up in story.
---
My Mesmer is at S4C3 in story and getting caught up. I'm also doing Fractals to get enough relics to buy the Infinite Potions, and working on the legendary Quip.
---
My Engineer is still back in starting Path of Fire, and I'll get story caught up with her when I am done with my Mesmer.
---
I also have an empty character slot, so one day, I'll make a Revenant, but I haven't decided which race yet.
---
Also, I do world bosses randomly whenever Fractals suck, or I'll wander about farming materials in a random map because I'm sure they'll be important someday for something in some way.
---
dulfy showcases her stuff in the entrance of honor of the waves dungeon. Try it over there for a comparison first. The lighting effects from maps can have substantial differences in appearance and every map varies quite a bit. eg. queensdale/bloodstone fen/mistlock sanc make everything shine brighter than normal.
---
I understand your concern with botting, but I don't think that is the main reason.  
---
I think it's mainly because so many people think "MMO" and believe all meaningful content should be group oriented.  Anet does listen and often goes with what the majority wants.  If enough people really did want solid options for solo content, I think we would get it.  
---
For the botting, if someone can really bot things like dedicated solo dungeons, fractals, etc...then they can go ahead and multibox and bot it with 5 accounts. 
---
That's what I was thinking too. Like either that or Kralk has managed to infiltrate the Fractals part of the mists and branded the Jade Maw Fractal. Which thinking about it, seems like it could be a really cool hardmode or alternate version of the map.
---
make another legendary 
---
So what you're saying is a commander stopping their k train to fuss at you for trying to 1v1 an npc?  bc most, and I mean most commanders do not care since guards are annoying and it is best that you DO kill them because they can contest points/are annoying. And that one commander sounds like a twat.
---
How many hours did two hours take though?
---
Exactly.  Give us options.
---
Farm wood because it's pretty good gold if you have an efficient route
---
Raids
---
Learning fractals again because t4 pugs scared me into not trying again for months.
---
Add on a third hour for sifting through the loot and putting it on the TP. 
---
Pve bag farm. "Welcome to WvW bitch!!" 
---
Pve bag farm incoming!!! "Welcome to WvW bitch"
---
But yours looks better
---
It comes from the Vinewrath chest?
---
Good god, with how often people run SW, I can't imagine how insanely rare it must be. That's even more expensive than the invisible boots.
---
Historically I've played north lane for VW, but I started playing south lane because new classes I'm messing with.
---
I noticed that, after my champ was dead, if I ran in for mid or north and took damage from the laser or left a turret, I'd get bronze participation. So that seems like another way to milk bags.
---
play some tanky brawler like chronobunker..you get so many defensive cooldowns you can waste some and still come out on top
---
Have you done all the story and maps? That’s a lot of good content right there. 
---
A large demographic of gamers are really just the worst kind of people. Every game I go to has some cesspool brooding about something unimportant in their lives.
---
This is excellent.  I think it covers all the general points, but let me add a few more specifics.
---
* If you split up, build siege in out-of-the-way places first with the whole team.  Wait until most of the siege is done building to start firing to minimize build-time and maximize damage.  Also, if you know where the enemies will begin scouting from, try to have siege there and on the opposite end of the structure.  They may neglect to do a full scout run and lose hundreds of supply in damage.
---
* Yaks are more important than siege damage.  A single Yak will let them repair about 10 catapult shots, depending on the wall tier and catapult mastery.  If you're trying to whittle a Keep down rather than blitzing it outright, always prioritize killing the Yaks.  This is even more important if the objective is still upgrading.
---
* Controlling supply is how you win/lose the game.  If offense controls the supply, defense has to have a zerg permanently camped at the lord or they lose the objective.  If defense controls the supply, it will be very difficult to make damage stick.  Do not expect to take/hold a Keep unless you participate in the Yak game.  Since supply lines are vulnerable, offense has a huge advantage here.
---
* Don't sit in a Keep to scout.  You must keep tabs on all enemy roamers in your zone so that you can respond to attacks proactively.  Don't wait until they have siege firing to respond or you'll take serious supply damage.  With good warning, you may prevent them from building any siege at all.
---
* You can treb enemy supply depots to destroy supply directly.  This is by far the fastest method to drain their supply.  Practically no one has ready-made defenses to block treb shots in this area either.
---
* You can treb (cow) choke points to remove hundreds of supply from a zerg (20+).  Each successful cow will mean 2 or more fewer catapults on your walls.  Some trebs can then be used to damage siege with rocks once supply is burned.
---
* You can disable siege that is in the process of being built using a Siege Disabler.  This will give you 30 seconds to damage it while preventing them from building it further.  Even if you can't destroy it, this means it will ultimately take more supply than usual to complete.
---
* On offense, spread your catapults out so that one Siege Disabler can't hit them all.  Each player can only use one at a time.
---
* At the end of your run, estimate the objective ticks your team gained due to your efforts, the points from yaks and the upgrades completed/not completed.  Compare this to the margin you won/lost the skirmish with.  Whether on offense or defense, an earnest player can make a critical contribution without ever flipping a Tower/Keep.
---
I do hope it continues soon, im interested in the others point of view. its interesting to see Rytlock leave sohothin behind after all hes been through to have it. Speaking of which i hope one day to re-introduce Magdaer into the story.
---
You get a free level 80 boost with each expansion. Do it.
---
TIL that one (well, two, since Fries doubled down on her stupid shit) person being an idiot and calling someone a sexist after asking a perfectly polite question is justification never to interact with a game community again, because not being a cunt takes too much effort.
---
if you hit the troll boss in the fort, you can get some extra bandit crests with the organ extractor, then use another extractor on the south lane boss too. its a small thing but crests can mean more keys/ bags of gear
---
i'm surprised nobody suggest blinding the mobs..actually not that surprised
---
not sure how swapping to scourge helped exactly?
---
There is a lot of achivments to do brother
---
Was me that sucked also. DPS quickbrand. Tome 3 skill 3 and skill 4 resistance and projectile reflect are too short duration. Perma chill hurts the Condi cleanse mantra cooldown also. I find positioning hard with the winds, dazing cone things and not getting outflanked and condi bombed. I'm not good at this fractal so I'll skip it in future. Reading other people's replies, the key seems to be killing adds then killing boss so they don't overwhelm a low damage group. We were all at less than 10k DPS. 
---
Anet: Ok we hear you, tentacles that bleed fire and have sugar rush
---
customer pays for content = customer wants content. As I know ArenaNet isnt some kind of charity organisation? 
---
this feels like I am watching an old Smosh Video.
---
Absolutely, but is that even a fair judgment between the two games, *and* should the games be compared that way? Should we be counting the high tier fractal releases as well, given their place in the game? Or comparing to FFXIV's raid boss count as well?
---
Part of the challenge is defining a fair metric.
---
Dude.. so well written and organized..
---
FFXIV has had 6 raid tiers with two difficulties and 4 bosses each since 2015, and 6 'casual' or alliance raids with 4 bosses each as well. If you also count the current expansion's "Each final boss of a tier is two bosses" then that adds 3. Also, 2 bosses have been re-released as Ultimate encounters.
---
So if you're counting boss names, the answer is 53. If you're counting unique encounters, inclusive of difficulties, then the answer is 79.
---
I don't know much about WoW currently, so I don't know if your comment meant 57 individual bosses, or if there was overlap/repetition due to difficulties.
---
Gw2 reaper *can* teleport with flesh wurm.
---
&gt; I had to infiltrate the main camp with tiger guy
---
I'm going to assume you mean you're on the Path of Fire mission where you infiltrate the forged camp with Rytlock?
---
The expansions are definitely more difficult than the original story. Heart of Thorns especially is.  However, the content should still be solo-able. If you're having trouble, you can always reach out for help. I'm sure there are people around who are willing to help.
---
Otherwise, [MetaBattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/MetaBattle_Wiki) is a good resource for checking out popular builds if your current one isn't working out.
---
You mention you're running with "lots of self healing." And while thieves do have a couple healing tricks up their sleeves, I wouldn't necessarily go deep into healing. Thief's defense comes from evades and stealth, and they're pretty glassy if you don't make use of those.  Plus, the game is generally centered around dealing damage, and mitigating incoming damage through positioning and evades.
---
If you're diving back into this after a long hiatus, it might be beneficial to take a step back and relearn the basics of both the game and the professions you have. Sounds like you've been gone for years, so take that into consideration.
---
I hope this helps!
---
They hit for less now, have for a while. I can't remember which patch made the change
---
It's because diviner is actually a Heart of Thorns stat set, it's been in sPvP since HoT
---
You used the boost didn’t you?
---
For future reference, you can run Plague Signet for some truly epic condition transfers. Not as crazy as throwing 60+ stacks of Torment at the Death-Branded Shatterer, but still pretty great.
---
Easy prey. Engi main
---
Yes Byzantium is the last chest.
---
You can't just buy 4 times the first backpiece, you need to buy 4 different. There are one of each rarity : blue, green, rare and exotic. Once you buy one, you will unlock the next one (the cost is higher each time). The total cost is 100 tickets. You get exactly that amount by finishing Byzantium chest.
---
Repeating the last chest doesn't reward any more tickets (or chest of grand marks). It only gives gold and shards. 
---
Quick answer. Yes. Because. 
---
Next time bigger shiny
---
Because there are no longer servers in pve
---
No anet support can just be painfully slow sorry.
---
I think it made sense back when worlds were worlds in all senses aside from just WvW.
---
Now that PVE are mega shards with all of the worlds combined, I don’t think it makes sense to have any connection between the two.
---
The server-wide bonuses were part of why bandwagoning began (I thought), and never seemed like they were a very good value as a result, for the game.
---
I hate crafting. Just going after the ascended and that's about it. Thanks anyway. I might want to hurt myself one day and decide to make legendaries.
---
They don't refund skin items because they aren't able to remove the wardrobe unlock.
---
thanks for the advices m8
---
Amusing that you tied "balance" in there with legitimate criticisms.  
---
  
---
There are classes that are balanced.  They are ones that have developers play them, there are a few classes that have never had a developer play as them, and it clearly shows.
---
Servers facing servers with stacked link realms would be screwed over by the wvw guilds rigging the fights these days. WvW is kinda unbalanced with the present situation. No point in rewarding easy mode servers. 
---
Give him all the dislikes you want but the hype anet was building up around this announcement was not worth the payoff at all. Not to mention I think we could've survived without the 30 second youtube upload that was why I assume it announcement got postponed so long.
---
If that's how carefully they need to reveal something that small, well i'm very, very scared for this game's future.
---
Those are quite nice. Good job. Would like to see more of your other characters.
---
No i hit 80 ages ago and dipped out when i found out there was no end game, now i see there is a lot more to do at cap since the launch and im hoping to find some joy in it. The feedback ive  gotten will deffinatley help in re aquanting my self with the game and a general direcrion to go in. I feel like a boosted 80 since everything has changed. If you can offer some help its appreciated.
---
Nah it says on the press release that warclaw in its entirety is for PoF players
---
Thats another thing i havnt figured out is how to unlock those elite masteries, i got the weapons but cant equip them. Do i need to play through HoT story first?
---
Welcome back ;)
---
&gt; Revamp the rewards system to a unified dungeon token with ascended options like wvw, pvp, etc. has. 
---
I seriously doubt this would happen, the whole idea was that you do dungeons for the skins/to get experience with group content, then you move on to fractals, which is the next step after dungeons. And fractals already drop ascended rewards like crazy.
---
WoW. Have you tried raiding? your entitled ass would fit perfectly over there.
---
Oh, neat. I'm going on the fact that i got a gathering tool refunded but anet couldn't remove the skin from my wardrobe, and figured that they just *couldn't*. If they refunded you for an item that's only a skin, they *must* be able to remove the skin from the wardrobe otherwise every gemstore skin is functionally "free"
---
Cue Careless Whispers
---
I would give wvw a try. Despite what people may whine about,  it truly is pretty fun once toy take a little time to learn what to do
---
Hi there! Quick question, hope it’s not too inconvenient but i haven’t really been able to find an answer:
---
I typically keep myself around 100 bandit keys, and then i buy a set of 5 obsidian shards per chest train loop, letting all the rest of my bandit crests build up. Is it more worth it to go for the sandy bags than the obsidian shards with my extra crests if i’m going for a legendary? Or is the gold/hr from the sandy bags better?
---
*Increased axe 1 damage by 5%
---
I've received some upvotes which I have no control over, so clearly I must've made it up...because that makes total sense. You can return to silently lurking now.
---
Eternity is so beautiful and I’m sure it’s rewarding to see the progress in just a year. Congratulations! Way to go! 🧡
---
why is this tagged as nsfw
---
Too sexy
---
Do the cabbage flavors even mean anything?
---
Reapers used to be the bottom of the food chain for roaming but they are slowly becoming the backbone of havocs or small sized roaming groups.
---
They still suffer from getting kited and as such, literally every ranged class laughs at them, but with skill and strategy it is possible to turn the tables.
---
Spectral Walk was also recently changed to cleanse Conditions which aids alot in protecting and generating the Reaper's valueable Lifeforce.
---
Spectral Grasp is a staple as a second "gap closer" besides Great Sword 5.
---
Warhorn is used to daze targets for long periods of time which ensures that yu can cc chain the target.
---
Axe is important to rapidly regain lifeforce in combat while GS is used to cleave or to safe stomp with Nightfall
---
Reapers are still ultra vulnerable alone but when paired with an ally or in a group their danger level increases quite a bit due to the amount of damage they can push out due to the lack of pressure.
---
*waggles eyebrows*
---
This kind of shit is exactly why I dont play WvW. Its not noob friendly at all! How is it supposed to gain more players? 
---
Chop cypress saplings and die in wvw like a champ!
---
one step   
---
Always ask for build templates, get angry every time you do not get them
---
Many people moaned when gliding was introduced in WvW, yet it's been nothing but more convenient. The same, I believe, will happen with this mount. People will complain about it, but when they first use it, they'll probably change their minds and like it. Instead, these days, most people bring out the pitch forks as soon as Anet dares to announce anything they're adding to WvW - and while there's reason to worry about anything being added (shield generators for example), we haven't even tried it out this warclaw mount yet. I think people need to calm down and bring out the pitchforks only after they've actually given the mount a go.
---
Reapers started to get the better of their opponents the moment Spectral Walk was changed to eat condis and convert into Lifeforce.
---
It made all the cheap condi axe mesmers jaunt into Reaper death traps who think they can bully Reapers.
---
Players like you are exactly why WvW is struggling

It used to be ~700 gold back when I still played. If you can believe that.
---
I'm pretty much the lowest tier of wvw player, maybe slightly better than full on pve scrub, I run a trailblazer necro and I'm shit at it, and even for me, reapers are easy kills.  I usually bring well of darkness against a reaper.  If they spend 2 or 3 seconds in it trying to melee me without realizing it, they are toast.  
---
For future reference, if you go to the skirmish vendor and preview the T3 piece, be sure to check "weilded" in the preview panel to see the tentacle effect otherwise it doesn't show and many have been confused about which piece adds this effect.
---
I know there’s some weird scrapper build that maintains super speed not sure if this is the tune it uses though 
---
If you raid, you can make a set of legendary armor. 
---
Scourges now lose 1 year off of their natural lifespan each time they summon a shade.
---
&gt; Condi spam no longer viable vs Reapers.
---
I didn't even know they changed it. A reaper roaming without support is still a free kill. 
---
Is that the one about boob visibility.
---
Well, it'll get me in wvw for the bare minimum time needed to unlock the mount before I leave again
---
But i will talk any shit i like
---
Clueless comic.
---
One of the biggest problem with those bonuses is that the people who benefit the most from them are not the people playing WvW but they are earned by the people playing WvW.
---
Now if only we could go to all the Citadels for each legion
---
It happens after a patch drops, which gives people time to have a fair advantage of buying the items they want before the price changes.
---
Unfortunately it's not bait, it's a true representation of what the vocal WvW critics actually think what dev resources go into WvW development. There is a mountain of evidence that shows the game mode benefits from the work of people all across the studio, from artists, rewards team people, mount devs, coders, QA and others, but people genuinely believe two devs work on WvW.
---
I think they want to bridge the time to the next episode with these short stories.
---
So we got one basically right with the episode at the end of January, if we get one every month, so end of Feb and end of March, it would tie us over quite nicely to the next episode somewhere approx. at the end of April/start of May.
---
NSFW xD
---
Where IS that thing at the moment BTW? I think Eir wanted to bring it to Occam after AC Story iirc. Does he still have it?
---
wHaT iS yOuR fAvOuRiTe QuAgGaN
---
There is difference between spam condis vs occasionally or dangerously (melee) applying it. Spectral walk is not be all end all condi counter.
---
Reaper gets destroyed by lot of other roamers like oneshot perma-stealth thiefs, spellbreakers, sic em sniper soulbeasts, mirages/shatter mesmers.. well, about anything really.
---
They're not going in blind. They have hundreds of people working there and I'm sure they consult with many of them.
---
I'm not going to claim to be a WvW player but my experience back before that update, when JQ was in it's prime, was that nothing outside of keeps really got upgraded ever. EB was just non-stop tower flips every 10-15 minutes. One zerg would roll through cap everything and then another serf would. Sometimes we even got into a fight. Maybe.
---
&gt; Well, if you implement them and they suck, you've just wasted your time implementing them + reverting the changes.
---
Could absolutely and easily still happen with player feedback so I guess we shouldn't change anything at all because it *might* be a waste.
---
I assume you're going to argue that it's more likely to be accurate but I don't actually think history bears that out at all.
---

I have burnout every year after whole steam of festivals. I start with Halloween, then barely log during wintersdays and I'm completely out during whole new year. I'm back to daily gw2 just after sab.
---
I left after 5000 hours.  Never asked for a mount ever.  I did ask for when world restructuring was done that it must definitely take time zone balance into consideration.
---
I recently went to check the latest post (Nov 2018) and it specifically says time zones will not be considered at all.
---
So world restructuring is going to be a complete fucking failure.  You'll get one server with 50 player South East Asian guild and another server with a 50 player North American guild.  They'll pass like ships in the night, never fighting each other.  Just PPT all night long because time zones aren't balanced at all.
---
The devs are TOLD about their mistakes AHEAD of time and yet they still don't see it.
---
Anyway, I might come back and get earn my horny battle pussy and then leave again.

Gliding caused huge problem in terms of exploits for many months and even led to the topography of EBG being significantly changed.

how dare you didnt use the mega thread where the whole topic gets buried
---
Thank you. I craft PvE legendaries all the time, just kind of figured the same applied to WvW.
---
The whispers rifle skin. One of the few non high end skins that looks like an actual thing that a person might carry and use to shoot things with.
---
 Long live the ACOG/suppressor flintlock.
---
* Complete all legendaries
---
* Complete all (or at least most) achievements
---
* Complete other expensive stuff (like having all shared inventory slots, having 320 inv (at least with my main)).
---
* Build a cool ~~Dojo~~ Guild Hall
---
* Maybe get some infusions that I like and spread them among my important characters.
---
* Go and do some soft-rping around the Shiverpeaks as the Norn lover I am.

&gt; The concept of the roon is really cool

In what way is it cool when you think the stat is meh and the #6 is lackluster? The only things left are its name and the fact that it is a superior rune.

To be fair, TF2 only has 10-15 people working on it. That's why updates take so long and why they rely so much on community content. The TF2 team is doing the best they can, it's the higher-ups at Valve that don't want to allocate more people and resources to TF2, because why support a game that's been among the top 10 most played games on Steam since release?
---
Necros can only raise others from dead, not themselves.
---
Yes, but releasing a LW episode during holidays would've been extremely awkward for everyone really. I do hope they will bring the releases back to schedule.
---
Yeah, that's it. I like to put it on medium rather than high. Makes the metals shiny, but not obnoxiously shiny. Some other environmental things do look better on high though, so it's a compromise.
---
dungeons are pretty much abandoned by anet so, no
---
The server crashes should now occur more frequently as opposed to random times. This was an unintended behavior.
---
It also doesn't work with the Holosmith superspeed jump forge skill 2 
---
As someone who mainly plays PVE, isn't every meta and also map rewards basically a reward track without the GUI?
---
Those poor, poor raptors outside of Rata Sum.
---
Raids, man! 
---
I just started out myself and it opened a whole new dimension of the game.
---
The way people around you operate, the way you operate, anxiety when first pushing that 'Yes' button on a ready check, those pesky squeeze-ins to high li groups with your low ass li count. There's a lot to learn, to pay attention to. Then, if you feel like you learned a lot say on a dps class, hop on a support of some kind.
---
i need 12 PoF mastery points to get everything in the PoF ranks. i have done all the map ones possible without griffin, what are some easy ones i can get? is getting the living world season 4 ones easy?
---
That's all nice if you're on a backline build, if you're on a frontline build and not listening you'll be off tag before you know it.
---
While we're on it, Nitro might actually be even better.
---
 I was in a pretty good group and we struggled...we tried weird things and then just went ham stacking cleave dps and everything melted fast and the last boss was muchhhhh easier 
---
im an old veteran that has pretty much everything i ever needed regarding characters ,gear and skins. 
---
That being said im:
---
* Going trough the normal daily for 2g+spirit shards
---
* Running trough 4 characters to get a few LWS3 currencies across 4 maps, so i can slowly and eventually spend the currency on some special skins and home instance upgrades
---
* For the last 2 years ive made countless new characters that i play with a special set of rules and challenging goals. This keeps the game always fresh and it feels different every time i start over.
---
* Currently im focusing on my now lvl 40 revenant with a new set of rules and goals. Im also recording my exploration and zhaitan story steps as i go trough them.
---
* On weekends i play a little bit of WvW just to get some progression towards my legendary wvw armor.
---
A year or two back,when pvp legendary wings came out, i was playing pvp, but only the bare minimum per day so i dont get burned out. This way i spread the grind across the year and around in december i crafted the legendary ascention.
---
I dont own any legendaries, i have enough gold to buy some, and to craft any one i wish, but i honestly dont know which one i would be going for.   
---
I cant decide because i want to craft a legendary weapon for my main, with my main...but i dont have a main character anymore. 
---
Since ive been doing just fine without a legendary weapon,i decided to see it as a grand final trophy /journey reserved only for the most hardcore of the challenge characters.
---
If i reach all of my goals on this revenant ill be making a legendary for the revenant then...tho im not sure which one yet :)
---
Hm it is interesting to look at these results and see the differences. 
---
I would recommend keeping things at a medium setting. What you could try, for potential performance boost (this involves no reshade sadly) is to look in to the dx12 wrapper this awesome dude made. The posts are here on the sub and about.. 1-2 weeks old. I will see if I can find it tomorrow and link it unless you beat me to it. 
---
I'm glad at least that it was somewhat working better? With the other d3d9.dll. With the version I sent you I tend to run:
---
Native client settings:
---
- medium or low animation (I find to not benefit visually much from it anyways, so why have it enabled if that's the case? Although taste is subjective ) 
---
- medium texture 
---
- medium shaders
---
- no reflections, never all (rarely terrain and sky) 
---
- low char mod (# of rendered players) 
---
- low char quality (# of rendered non-hoodie players(normal armor players))
---
- no post processing (personally get migraines from post processing in video games for some slight odd reason) 
---
Reshade;
---
- depth haze (low) for immersion 
---
- Luma sharpening (set it to the highest, then scale it down until you "think" it's not there anymore, toggle it a few times see if you notice a difference, if not, then up it bit, repeat toggle until satisfied) 
---
The other sharpeners have higher performance impact and tbh luma looks best. 
---
- adaptive fog, slider 1, 300. Slider 2, 200-300. Slider 3, adjust to taste. (You should still be able to see the sky) 
---
Avoid DOF settings as they are a huge perf impact 
---
Just those settings makes the game entirely visually different for me enough to keep the OG feel but allow for an improved experience. 
---
**Most importantly remember to enable performance mode down at the bottom**
---
Also, if you have the old reshade effects from 1.2.1, make sure that you download the latest ones as they are much much better in terms of not eating up your computing powers. 
---
I think the fact that in 132 comments nobody brought these up, says everything about how underrated they are:
---
The godskull weapons. Particularly the rifle is a beautiful bone cannon.
---
The problem with LS2 achievements is that they are only ever achievable once you completed a chapter, you can't just do them while doing the story on your first playthrough at the same time. You have to complete the chapter, and then replay the missions for the achievements. 
---
And that goes for every character, so even if you think in "mission 2 of chapter 5" you could use classX better than classY, you would still need to complete the whole chapter 5, not just up to mission 2.
---
same, i stop during 1 year or 2 then come back
---
I think the axe looks really cool...quite intricate. 
---
Doing the next legendary ;-) for example Auroa or Ad Infinitum.
---
Doing achievments, getting other shiny armour or weapons.
---
No but windows will take screenshot if u press win + print, and that can obviously be used anywhere. 
---
ravioli ravioli
---
blame the pasta codioli 
---
i dont really use black dyes ( a shocker i know..).
---
The darkest colors i use are either deep glacial sky (blue-black and it creates a special texture of a sort on all materials) and vintage silver (some special form of gray for a nice dirty-shine on metal pieces which also adds a special kind of texture).
---
Both go well on cloth pieces such as pants. They are both dark but also add a layer of texture in a way additionally to what the armor pieces offer.
---
You might wanna try more options on your dye panel and sort colors by hue, Youll find all the white-gray-black-darkness dyes grouped together and simply try them out on different materials to see which one you like best.
---
Then its only a matter of gold to buy the ones you like most. 
---
You might also check the birthday dye presents in case they are too expensive and you have a character that has such a gift coming soon to them
---
Mist magic fuckery.

Guild Wars 2 launched in August 2012, fractals were introduced in November 2012. Do you honestly think that they just decided on fractals as a last minute development idea? These things take time to design, plan, develop, test etc. Fractals were already on their plans well before the game actually launched, just like ascended gear were already on their plans before launch, but they failed to communicate it properly which is why people initially complained.
---
wait for the next LS playing other games, get back, play the new content, enjoy again, leave when done and repeat
---
I always read dungeons are bug infested by can't remember a single bug in all the runs I did for monk and nightmare runes.
---
You need to check the meaning of the word "legitimate".
---
Just get to 80 and play fractals, those are the dungeons for WoW players.
---
Dungeons are very easy as it is. If you cba to figure out that little number of mechanics, why bother playing any "challenging" content at all?
---
&gt; A group of 5 new level 40 players, with the average gear they'd be expected to have at that level (greens &amp; a couple yellows), have no chance in hell of finishing even the first Dungeon (AC), which is apparently for level 35s.
---
I'm calling BS. I did play AC with 40-something level PUG players (including my character), we did pretty well for a 4/5 noob party (I was the only one who had some prior dungeon experience). It was actually very fun. :D My knowledge of the dungeon didn't really help that much, because either players didn't have needed utility skills or didn't have enough damage to use your typical 80-lvl strats. So we just went in and worked our way to it. It's not a rocket science tbh.
---
And when your characters are higher level than that, 80 level or even have elite specs, dungeons become so trivial that you don't even have the chance to learn anything at all, since everything dies so quickly.
---
Don't get me wrong, dungeons could use a bit more love from Anet, but the drama level you try to imply is kinda... exaggerated.

Yeah she doesn't name a specific character, she just says "I know a blacksmith who can mend those pieces." Not even a specific race.
---
&gt; a mount that is just going to make lag issues worse
---
Just pointing out one thing here: do you actually *know* this will happen or just think it may happen? Because this kind of outlook only shows how little faith WvW players seem to have in ANet (as in regardless of whether a mount in WvW is something that people want or even viable from balance point of view, some people seriously seem to think ANet is in the business of *intentionally* breaking their game, which would literally mean more work for them).
---
It is quite unlikely that a balance patch lining up with the release of the mount is a coincidence. Just as it is unlikely that ANet would even consider additional significant systems related changes to WvW before the alliance system is done.
---
Compared to the other things they have in the pipeline for WvW a mount is low hanging fruit for them by comparison. Entirely different groups of people are likely working on the mount and alliance systems, because one is content production the other is systems/architecture related (i.e. the latter needs significant programming resources, and everything that comes with that, whereas a mount is just using an existing system).
---
Holy shit man, my Guild bros weren't joking, this reddit is where all the toxicity is in this game. I literally asked a question and at the time of posting this, I'm downvoted 77%? Really?
---
I'm not gonna ask anything anymore and just play another game man, holy shit.
---
I noticed it too, but I'm doing enough mental gymnastics on behalf of WvW already, I'll just go with it.
---
Must be a lucky fellow. 
---
I see I'm not the only one who enjoys doing this! so nice!
---
Its not cultural armor, its just an embroidered shirt I believe
---
As also a vet from 2012, i dont agree its just that simple as you say it is.
---
how i see gw2 as also a vet from 2012
---
* Good gear, namely exotic berserker is super easy to get nowdays, + the powercreep over the years made the core world super easy. Where mobs have stationary wind up attacks that you can side step away from, where mobs attack once per 3 seconds (or longer if you kite them), where mobs special attacks deal 1 stack of bleeding that does maybe 100 dmg per tick, where a minionmancer is able to solo champions without any problem at all.
---
* HoT  ramped up the difficulty a ton, introducing dangerous terrain, mobs with really strong attacks , mobs with hard cc, mobs with break bars, mobs with spike critical hits, mobs with moving while under stealth, heavy condi pressure and more.
---
* PoF kinda lowered the dmg across all mobs slightly, but made the mobs patrol in groups which combined makes a powerful combo of cc, protection, sniping, spike dmg, condi pressure and everything nasty. On top of that, mobs in PoF have special "trait" like abilities, which grants the mobs a lot of boons, and some even have weapon sigil effects.
---
* All that being said, Yes the combat is skill based, and theres a lot of versatility in building your character across most of the professions and you can play however you wish with whatever you wish. But as you get better at the game you will be able to go full glass cannon and with that, simply get stronger and better at the game.
---
* The devs focus on living world episodes which comes every 4-ish months. Vets who have been around for years cant say there is a significant improvement every time they released a story. From the "clunky slow and then rushed" zhaitan story, to the temporary "real" living world season 1, to the more polished story telling of season 2, to the amazing HoT story which can be replayed as a sylvari or as another race and have a distinct different feel while playing it... to the masterpiece PoF story is, to the latest LWS4 episode that has an amazing cinematic value and polish among sound, music, narrative and events that happen around you as you play trough the game.
---
* PvP has been getting support for years, but at a slow pace. From balance patches, changes to rank points and ranking system, additional reward tracks, leagues and league chest reward tracks, league ranks, adding unique pvp armor and weapon skins, including legendary armor and legendary backpack /glider skins. + A few new maps, automated tournaments and 2v2s.
---
* WvW has also gotten a similar pvp treatment with unique wvw weapons and armor, legendary sets, new participation rewards, and new map into the rotation, gliding and now mounts. 
---
* PvE gets most of the love tho, and rightly so as its the most popular game mode. New expansions give new masteries, new elite specs, new zones and gameplay such as adventures or bounty hunting and numerous achievements and armor/weapon skins. Even new stat sets. LW episodes come with new zones with its own rewards including an additional mount. New fractals have been added over the years which are also included to F2P players, and some new raids have been added over the years (tho not as much as some people wish to be)
---
The game it self is buy to play, has no monthly subs, it respects your time, it has a permanent lv and gear cap of 80, it gives everyone free dlc if you simply log in when it releases and a pve open world where you can play as whatever you wish, with a lot of freedom of movement and choice on how and on what pace you wish to progress trough the game (which also helps a lot with the amount of freedom you have when making up rules for some self made up fun challenges). This kind of game does make casuals thrive, but thats not such a bad thing as the game cant sustain it self from hardcore players only (look at wildstar for example). 
---
Im not saying things are perfect, but if youre long enough here you should know that not everything can be blamed on anet my friend.
---
The raid community has been shutting them self from new interested members for years now. Be it by being elitist, or kicking anyone for ridiculous reasons that we see on reddit every so often (asking for a specific amount of LI, but not accepting legendary raid armor to count as LI is just one example). Asking for meta and meta only with perfect skill rotations only when its been proven that you can beat a lot of encounters while under maned, in greens, in exotics, with non meta set up and more.
---
I can understand high skill level asking for other high skill experienced players so they can "speed clear the raid" just as dungeon groups are formed with " lvl 80 only" tags. But when pugs with noobs, kick other noobs for not being experienced or having 1 k lower dps than its been shown on a benchmark video, or simply leaving the team after the first wipe that got the boss at 20% hp is a whole different thing.
---
And we see this in wvw as well. Threatening and trash talking about anyone new stepping foot on the battlegrounds. "we dont need you pve scrubs go away", "oh no now we gonna get pve carebares running around wvw trying to get the new mount".
---
And lets not even go to Spvp... where everyone blames everyone, and all professions are broken useless when you loose with one, but all professions are OP when you win with one.
---
The main reason why old vets are leaving is because they have been playing the game for 5+ years  and have done "everything" in the game (some literally, others just the things they wanted/needed)
---
Even the most hardcore people that do absolutely everything in the game already did everything in the game and gotten all the skins, legendaries, masteries, crafting disciplines etc to max.
---
So its perfectly fine to leave and come back when theres a new thing added, be it a fractal, raid or a new living story, or a new pvp league.
---
Or do you honestly think the solution to keep veterans playing would be some sort of a gear grind? doing the same raid over and over and over again for months just so you can get a slightly better weapon, made useless on the next content patch like in some other games which are less casual than this one? 
---
I'm pretty sure that F6 is not a default keybind for screenshots in gw
---
1. Large travel times are a core issue in WvW. They have always been one. It's not fun to spend a considerable amount of your time in the game mode running, it's not the reason why you you went there. So the dev time you're worried about is actually dev time used to address a core issue.
---
2. The groups with more numbers already have an advantage in both attack and defence. Server population and coverage reign supreme in WvW for ages. Mounts change nothing.
---
3. Mounts in PvE are actually quite fragile. Yes, they ignore CC effects but their health pool is very low so forced dismounting will not be so hard either way.
---
4. Evade potentially allows for very smart plays, \*however\* it has an easy counter. First, because of (3) and second, because mounting requires you to be out of combat. You don't want the enemies to push through and wreck your backline? Simple, don't allow them to disengage. This will still sometimes cost you the fight as it will allow the enemy to draw you away, but I see this as an actual positive, as it reduces the incentive to have a zerg bunker down in some hole and create a stalemate that lasts until one side gets bored and leaves.
---
I found this in fractals too though. Literally made me stop getting back into the game.
---
There's always some vocal cunts in all game modes.
---
then tell your friend to log in once more he shouldnt be able to accept those ectos but he can hit the return to sender button so you at least get those ectos back
---
Looks like a infinity stone
---
Good? When the patch drops the Q is gonna be like 300 + all the pve plebs gonna be there it's gonna be a carnival .
---
Its not noob friendly no, not in the majority, but we actually do like having new people who are eager to learn. So all you have to do is go to a tag, join their squad and adjust your build after you ask them whats mostly useful. If they see you asking for advice and trying well then you're good to go :) dont let mean or passive-aggressive comments bring you down because c'est la vie and these are everywhere.
---
I can see people who get themselves in bad situations and then just use a stealth skill to try to get far enough away to break combat, then mount up and run for the hills.
---
Geralt really became a playa in his old age.
---
You're going to stop playing gw2 and play another game just because of a loss of internet points? Really?
---
I'd rather get legendary vanquisher and guardian with 7 heros than having to rely on 4 crappy henchmen or on real players. You can do everything on your pace.
---
Mkay...
---
Is it always that toxic in NA WvW as it seems in these comments? Bc from all the years on several EU servers ive never seen anything remotely close to what ppl tell about in these comments.
---
The only thing i have actually experienced were ppl on Deso going for karmatraining and ppt while actual commanders wanted to go for fights. They just told them to go fuck themselves and continued farming not even defending or fighting for anything
---
This is incredibly tedious but it works, thank you.
---
Usually my daily routine is T4+CMs as priority number 1. Then the easy WvW dailies and then meta run from Thunderhead North to Jahai Shatty + generals.
---
Atm I'm working on getting map materials for Aurora so I farm instead of Meta run. If I have nothing better to do I do raids for fun/practice since I do a fullclear on mondays. If I didn't do fullclear I'd spend a lot of time pugging raids. 
---
Plus I am one person with 7 accounts I only use efficiency on my main. I know I'm not alone in having multi accounts and personally think this will make a large difference in what is considered active players 
---
Don't know why they offended when a WvW player calls pve players plebs ,cuz when I do feactals and other pve related events I see pve players call me pvp scrub ,it's like a teasing between players and game modes ,nothing to be offended by.
---
We're going to have SO MUCH FUN playing this FUN game mode.
---
I never play wvw. Mount is not just another skin so i have to get it.
---
Sadly I must do wvw now so I will be present there daily until I got it with all skills. You better orepare for it. I'm bringing whole pve community with me.
---
OR pray for anet to give us a possibility to obtain it any other way.
---
Some can be like that, but on the otherside you can just ignore namecalling (which happens in every gamemode btw, raids, pvp and fractals) and just get on about your day. Just because one or two people get nasty doesn't mean everyone is
---
That's the best part.
---
"This isn't an open squad, idiot! Look at the tag color!"... No, sorry. If it were a "private" squad, it'd be hidden. It's very much for everyone, **we can see that tag!** You can already prevent people from joining, that's plenty.
---
It is actually fun with the right people, the task is to find the right people and guild to play with, which can take some time.
---
@ragnorke its GP/H actually isnt bad, quit sperging.
---
The spreadsheet hasn't been updated since early 2018, but yeah it can be upwards of 30-50g per hour depending on available recipes and tour speed. Especially for people who don't have recipes, rising ecto and mat prices are good for dungeons.
---

---
Yeah. DaoC did this smarter by being generally larger (since movement was so much slower) and then having the best farming spots in RvR. **If** you wanted to accept the risk.
---
But with the slow movement and large zones you could go without being run down continuously
---
Yeah exactly, and i don't understand why people expect to be held by the hand into it, just ignore the mean comments as you would any other way really. Doesn't mean everyone is like that, its usually just some random people around. Guilds and squads are rarely like this, but you also need to have the balls to ignore stuff and not get offended with the tiniest bit.
---
I think the problem is - WvW has limits of players and no difficulty scale. So it kinda brings the worst from Raids while not giving event the best from Fractals. The difference is - in Raids you can kick under-performing player or put some requirements on joining players. In WvW you cannot in any way choose who will be able to join and who not. Imagine your raiding party is auto-generated by game from all skill level with no ability to kick specific player. This exactly is how WvW works, except there is a limited amount of players in your team, so if tons of people join, others will be unable to play.
---
WvW is practically a pinnacle of how to breed toxicity in community, half of the mechanic endorse and encourage hating other players.
---
I kinda fell sorry for the pve players u gonna die alot even if u stay with zerg and blob gankers gonna  have a field day farming u 
---
Ahah, i know this. i was being sarcastic towards them! 
---
i will probably enjoy wvw more then i've previously done with the mount since i'll have an actual good reward to work towards, and i wont be walking from point a to point b for 10 minutes. Looking forward to it!
---
Needs even tigher trousers for that. 
---
Well if they stay on tag they should be fine most of the time
---
Nice! **Pro tip though:** don't expect a WvW mount to keep you in WvW longterm because it won't. If you really want to get into it you will need to try and find a guild thats great fit for you, its all about the community, not the rewards :) 
---
I'm pretty sure gankers gonna be like mosquitos around the zerg/blob any wrong step and ur doomed .
---
What if mounted players in enemy territory (or even everywhere) will be shown on the map?
---
Raid next tho, we got a fractal last episode and they said they’re going to release fractals and raids in turns. 
---
Nitro is good, but nothing beats a pitchfork
---
Kite them, one by one. That's how i managed to win with my Guardian.
---
Then just do any of the big farms already in place solo...
---
Like the game is solo friendly enough, why would you want a solo farmzone on a MMO?
---
I don't want to be rude but that is straigth up stupid
---
That would also prob kill the game even more
---
That's an interesting take. The Anet Guild is a special guild that all employees of Anet are/can be a part of. They do not need to rep it. Additionally, not all employees in a company are developers, and even if they were, they don't typically have the push and pull to make significant changes. They tend to have things go down the pipeline and just work on what they're told to.
---
This point splits at here with there potentially being outsourced employees that are part of Anet and the guild (see: Customer Support) and also that Anet as a company isn't listening whether or not the developers are. The latter is something that you see with releases, where a lot of issues are left unaddressed and the general dynamic/focus of the company is elsewhere.
---
New superhero team by the gods.
---
Probably Beigarth though. At least that's what seems to be the simplest conclusion, since Eir knew him and he knows how to rework deldrimor steel and other fanciful weaponry.
---
Are you still searching for a code ??
---
With queues maybe eotm will see some players again
---
It wasnt a quote but thanks

From the first blog post

&gt; It’s the only mount that can carry you into battle in the Mist War, where its skills **truly shine**.

This he is trash in open world.

For all of PvE players who will inevitably join WvW just for this mount, and have no idea what to do, a few pieces of advice from player who joined WvW about a year ago, and is still a noob (but a noob enough to farm skins and mist trinkets from WvW):
---
I think the basic change in your behaviour is this - **you are not a hero, you are just a soldier**. If you get downed in the battle don't worry and don't loose focus, you may get a rally. If you die completely, spawn back at nearest waypoint and wait a bit, then join other people who died and run back to group with them. By the way - pick supplies from your main keep and build EVERYTHING your commander places. If you want to run with commander, remember to always pick those supplies, as well as picking a class that either is useful to group (spellbreaker for elite, herald for damage and boons, guardian for heals and boons) or benefits from group (elementalist and necromancer on full offence). Medium classes and mesmers are rarely useful for group and not advised for newbies (but if you are good at PvP, you may pick them and hunt for other lone players).
---
Most players will probably try to follow one of commanders (if commanders won't end up stuck somewhere in queue). For this pick a group class and fit it with exotics or higher, preferably stat combination with either vitality or toughness (both of them is overkill). For example changing from berserker to wanderer is a good idea for power lovers. Pick a ranged weapon and AoE skills, since your enemies will rarely move in predictable way. Try as much as you can to keep close to commander. This way you will get both heals and buffs from each other. Constantly throw your cheapest (low cooldown) skills towards enemy group, as a form of ranged pressure. When two hostile groups crash into each other keep in mind that being close to your allies will ensure your survival for prolonged time. Also - big fights are a good moment to use big skills.
---
In WvW you have two sources of loot:
---
1. Reward track - this one works like in PvP. Pick a track that interests you and you will get rewards for as long as you remain active in WvW. To keep yourself on high rewards you can join a group and run with commander until your "participation meter" reaches maximum (tier 6). Then do whatever you want, but remain active. You can for example escort supply transports (dolyaks) which will keep your activity high for as long as you do this. The higher tier of your participation, the faster gains from reward track. A lot of skins to get there.
---
2. Pips - you will earn those only if your participation is at least half of maximum (tier 3). You cannot pick your reward track, but those include WvW currency as well as a chests with a choice of unidentified dyes, hero points etc. 
---
You do not get any rewards for winning in WvW. Taking supply camps, towers, keeps or a castle has no meaning. All those activities will raise your participation tier, but give no rewards on their own. Additional rewards may be gained via WvW dailies, but those often simply give you WvW reward track potions. The fastest way to gain max participation tier is killing enemy players, even if you do it with group and only hit them once or twice. If you are going to farm players, remember that healing allies doesn't count.
---
AFK'ing in WvW makes no sense - if your participation drops, you get no rewards no matter how long you stay in WvW. Your participation does not go down when you are outside WvW, so there is no need to stay in WvW to "cash in participation" since you either achieved your goal (got a mount) or did not achieve it yet and it will be good to start from top participation the next day. 
---
Oh my god, the gnashing of teeth when Auric Basin and Istan got nerfed was epic.  And I was still a PVE-exclusive player back in the multiloot days.
---
I hope so
---
Isn't he a member of Date's Razor? 
---
I like the idea of a dolyak mount that lets you carry extra supplies
---
Three digit queues used be extremely common back during tournaments and seldom these days only on reset on stacked servers.
---
I really think this post could be flagged for rule number 3: DRAMA!!!
---
My...GOD. Dude, you gotta get outside man! There is more to life than this game!!
---
It's not fun, therefore it's an issue. Wiping would still be something to be wary of, as you'd still need time to regroup, lose position, give points to the enemies, etc.
---
Dieing in fractals isn't fun either, doesn't mean we should get rid of it.
---
Also fuck the mistward armor. Every artists nightmare.
---
I’m betting on new current events. Not sure entirely where they are going but it seems to be important we understand the gods in some detail. 
---
A return of the gods is still very possible as it gives us a chance for a major character to ascend to god hood to replace balthazar. 
---
Dying in fractals doesn't involve running two minutes on foot to get back on the boss. Dying/wiping isn't the problem, the downtime in actual gameplay is.
---
that more than 500 in-game hours of boosters so yeah it's doable but let's face it, you not gonna spend your next 3 months in-game doing just wvw while being 100% in-action all the time so put it as one of your 2019 targets and enjoy the game
---

---
However, why would you recommend punishing the winning group? They could use this downtime to recover, get supplies and group up again.  
---
Downtime is not a bad thing if it's intentional amd fits the gamemode. Why do you think you can't instantly respawn in most mobas but there's a cooldown?
---
I had a dream today that Elon Musk is sitting in a forest and sending me memes and now I see this, do I have to be worried?
---
That is good to hear. I will probably obtain it and never come to WvW until they bring something exclusive as well.
---
For some reason I can't play longer than 1 hour on WvW because it makes me sleepy.
---
take some and send them to anet. problem solved
---
It's a bad thing, because it's boring. Because of downtime Laser Tag is so much more fun than Paintball. I'll even go as far to say it's boring for the winning side as well.
---
I don't think so.  A system that rewards winning fights is exactly what WvW needs.  Killing 1000 people a night should get you more than a stack of heavy loot bags and some greens and blues.  You did work out there.  The only problem is it would encourage people to blob up.  The counter would be to just run away though...which is what a lot of people already do on NA.  If they know your guild or see you have numbers on them (even if its not 1:2 odds), people will give up right away.  Capture a T3 keep?  Yep, you should be rewarded for that too.
---
No, it's sheepskin doublet. T1 norn cultural.
---
Where are you waiting exactly ?
---
maybe its just another intern
---
As already mentioned by OP, thank you for your benevolence.
---
I have 2 wishes, off hand sword for guardian, and longboe for mesmer/elementalist. Don't mind the particulars as long as they happen
---
If you go to Your PVP build, there are default builds that mention which expansion is required. You can try those then change them to suit your style.
---
Not really, no. PVP is salty regardless of what game you play.
---
You mean greater death mark into CC breakbar while the Hall of chains pizza tiles catch fire and the spiders pulse retal on Qadhuumina is not a good idea? Sounds fun to me.
---
Probably more a hint to something coming during or alongside Episode 6. If it were just a current event, I'd imagine they'd just launch that.
---
The thing about cpus is that you can't really read everything about their power just from cores and speed. Which ones are you looking at exactly?
---
He aggros those who get pulled by the first guy going in and then keeps on fighting until there are no more around. Would make it easier if he wasn't able to fight.
---
I'm Mainly a PvE player, im kind of hoping youre able to earn the new mount in EoTM, its kind of the only way i used to enjoy WvW and i dont wanna take opportunity to play thier game mode from the actual WvW people due to queues, not fussed about gaining tickets etc. i just hope there will become a way to start + finish the mount there to i can return to PvE like the scrub i am xD
---
Sure, technically it could, but let's talk about likelihoods as well. Them brushing up about all the gods before some god-related release is infinitely more likely than an announcement about GW3.
---
Made me think of a crackpot theory. What if during the Harvest Ceremony, Shiro was imbued by Bubbles magic and not Dwayna as they believed. Then, when released, Bubbles magic branded everything.
---
Why would a water dragon's brand make shit solid? IDK man get outta here with your logic.
---
I need to get [Nadijeh's Marshal Inscription](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Nadijeh%27s_Marshal_Inscription). Short of grinding bounties, what's the best way to get trade contracts?
---
But the gods never lived in Cantha either...
---
I'm confused :P
---
maybe put some stuff that a f2p player can buy on TP,and then let him buy it? hell get a green lvl 5 weapon, but you get all the gold -15% tax i guess?
---
Why do you need the ascended inscription? Just buy the exotic of the tp and swip swap
---
god related content is very likely
---
the gods returning is very unlikely
---
legendary weapons are just as meh as other weapons
---
OMG! He looks so fluffy
---
Dungeon-dungeons are out of support unless something terrible happens; fractal-dungeons are the thing here
---
After majorly tryharding and dieharding the game since launch, as of the anniversary video where they said no expansion for an extra year, I just log in for patches for a while and play other things. Has done wonders for my frustration at/with the game right now.
---
or joining a queue for pvp.
---
It's the same with gliding though.
---
Ooo very nice :3 
---
Well, probably
---
Nah, we already know it's pretty soft.
---
for dungeons axe/mace GS is a great way for dps and having a nice strong aoe cc in dungeons.
---
your team should also have and use at least 1 cc so that breaking bars goes faster and it does break.   
---
You could also use kick for added cc and a dps boost as well.
---
As for pvp..well..it depends on too many things really. if your going 1v1 then having a lot of cc might help you against some professions, while not on others, and sometimes having a shield bash stun will be enough to burst them down.
---
In 5v5 it really depends on a lot of things, including your own team and what they do and how they focus on targets and use their cc (if they even have any).
---
If youre looking for a "solo" self sustained pvp build i highly suggest checking out some meta builds out there. 
---
If youre looking to find something that works for you but isnt meta then go ahead and try things out your way.
---
Try playing a few matches with a hammer, with dual maces, or just 1 mace, see what works best for you most of the time and go for it
---
Must've missed it, are we calling him cat dad after the short story where he talks about his kids?
---
Just because a vocal minority (yes, forums also fall into that category) is asking for something it does not make that something reasonable. Speaking in general, so don't nitpick. Bandwagon logical fallacy. 
---
Whereas mounts are vastly popular wherever they are available, and that's a fact. I'd understand if ANet was simply releasing the existing mounts in WvW, which would cause all sorts of problems because of the high jump and flying. But they aren't, they're designing a mounts specifically for WvW.
---
Following op's guide I see. Well done.
---
Bring a friend to fracts. Or even a guildie. Makes a world of difference.
---
Or whether his name is pronounced "Mingus."
---
It really is strange how they are wording requirements for the new mount. It isn't likely going to be higher wvw rank, because reasonably high wvw rank isn't something you can grinf even in a week. It cannot be the same as gliding, because wvw points are per character and mount seems to be an account unlock, that works outside of wvw too.  It could be something you unlock via rewards tracks, but reward tracks aren't tied to wxp at all. 
---
The only thing I can imagine is them putting items that are required to unlock the new mount straight into wxp rank up chests. 
---
Menzies wasn't a god. Dhuum however was.

Not likely only because it's likely for the 26th patch, which while will no doubt (to me) will have content to play, it won't have major content (it'll be akin to the underwater chest, design-a-weapon collections, or rollerbeetle racing imo), but the gods returning in GW2 is very likely because during the Path of Fire AMA, someone asked why Lyssa wasn't mentioned by Balthazar at the end and the response was "the gods' story isn't finished".
---
I had this problem few weeks ago. You can indeed do the defending event but the problem is this event is really easy and quick to do (you can solo it so it will basically never fails). And it spawns every 4 hours or so. So basically you have a 5min window every 4 hours and that gives the impression that the event is bugged. 
---
Two solutions :
---
- if you can, play at night. I was able to do it at 3AM (and I wasn't alone, even at night the event doesn't fail).
---
- the maps reset when there is a new patch. Try to have a character at the Lyssa waypoint and when the patch hits relog as quickly as possible to have access to a fresh map. 
---
The first thing is possible (even though the Commander never struck me as the religious-type, so this will be most like Kasmeer's idea).
---
Or post-episode 5 Kralkatorrik decided its time to chase some delicious sources of magic - the gods must be for him like a lamp for moths.
---
That is incorrect. Both [the Orrian History Scrolls](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Orrian_History_Scrolls#The_Six) and [The Seventh Reaper](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Cathedral_of_Silence_%28story%29#Dialogue) state that the Six Gods arrived on the world at Orr - specifically Arah - having been drawn to the world by The Artesian Waters.
---
This is not an uncommon timeline confusion, given that humanity *re*appeared on continental Tyria in 205 BE, while having been brought to Cantha by the gods in 786 BE. But at an unknown time before 786 BE, the gods and humanity arrived on the world via portal at Arah.
---
The confusion is unfortunately exasperated by ArenaNet's [pre-PoF timeline article](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_2:_Path_of_Fire%E2%80%94Road_to_the_Desert) but it's been clear [since the days of Factions](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/An_Empire_Divided) that humans came from elsewhere in the world, across a body of water, before reaching Tyria.
---
But basically, the timeline is:
---
* Date Unknown: Gods arrive on the world at Arah, bring humans with them.
---
* Date Unknown2: Gods take humans elsewhere in the world; might be (but unlikely to be) Cantha.
---
* 786 BE: Gods guide humans to Cantha via boat. They arrive on the northern shores, then later further south. Luxons retain oral stories of a homeland across the sea that they came from.
---
* 205 BE: Humans arrive on Orr, Istan, and Kourna by from somewhere other than Cantha (per An Empire Divided and other sources, Canthans had no knowledge of Tyrian settlement and vice versa for "several decades" after this date).
---
Besides all that, humans didn't scout for the gods. Gods brought humanity; it's suggested that the Forgotten functioned as scouts, as they're both anciently devoted to the Six and they were in Cantha before humans (source: An Empire Divided again, linked above).
---
The evade isn't a problem because of people disengaging to mount up, its a problem because of people starting fights on their mounts.
---
PvE mount health ranges from around 5k to about 10k, these are not insignificant values to add as a buffer to peoples health pools.
---
Maybe I'm wrong but compounding an advantage with more advantages does seem like a pretty big problem to me. You can't just dismiss that out of hand because the larger group already has a natural advantage.
---
As someone else mentioned, travel times are a gameplay mechanic and I would add that this is especially true of fights over the objectives that mounts would help you get to faster. The other issue is that for a large amount of players right now the content in the game mode isn't fights around objectives, it is fights in the open field against other groups. If mounts lower the quality of those fights to let people get to objectives faster that is a significant downside for a large amount of the current WvW playerbase.
---
 years of precedent where the new 'fresh blood' refuse to listen, chnage build, or change class to what we need, taking up spots on a  queued map when we are facing 2 enemy blobs but only 30 ppl on tag  
---
fuck off
---
Yep and honestly that's probably a fundamental flaw of the format in any case. It doesn't scale the way PVE does so growing it only does so much for the well being of the game. I did spend some time playing WvW (silver rank I think) to where I got to know a good portion of the guilds and folks that played at various times on my server. It's just not that many people playing the format. And this cat mount is going to get PVE folks to play the format for a bit but probably not for very long. My guess is not as long as when Warbringer was added. And I'm guessing the population limit will prevent the WvW scene from improving in any meaningful way anyway. 
---
you will have to complete them with your alts yes.
---
On the positive side, some rewards are interesting to get (bl keys, skins...)
---
Meanwhile, the [new instabilities](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fJh2gIBOto&amp;t=1m7s) were also added to WvW.
---
Well, Kralkatorrik's restrained himself to the afterlives of Tyria. So he's not near the point of eating the multiverse just yet, despite the hyperbole of Snaff.
---
I mean, at the level Kralk's at, you can argue all the Elder Dragons have been eating the multiverse.
---
When I'm in the mood for farming, I also do Bloodstone Fen.  Pretty much everything gives Unbound Magic (even neutral creatures like Moa's) and the stolen bag/salvageable scrap drop rate from white Mantle is really high.  There's also always an event happening somewhere, mainly because the two clerics are on different timers.  I can farm that map for a couple hours and have 20 bouncy chests in my queue.
---
I never seen such exaggeration from a silent letter. 
---
it was not a big sheep that was skinned 
---
This kinda feels like the entire WoW BfA drama all over again... There's a general feeling among the gaming community that all the devs are the big evils. While some companies really do produce some outrageous garbage \*cough\* EA \*cough\* bethesda \*cough cough\*, we should not forget to take a step out of the mess once in a while and check in with what's actually happening. It's easy to point our fingers towards the down vote button these days, but please, try to keep an open mind - for anet's sake and for your own sake too. And make sure your criticism is directed to the right things and not just pointless crying, at least on public forums. Thanks &lt;3
---
I believe this happens when players get serious about class builds. Is there shouting and rudeness in Raids, too?
---
What if Menzies gets a day and its Lyssa that doesn't?
---
It's not a good idea to drain the main keep though. It's okay to take supplies if keep is full (or nearly full), but only then. It's best to take supplies from a nearby tower or camp instead, so the keep will have enough supplies to defend it case it comes under siege.
---
Ironically, one of those things would be... Mounts.
---
Then Lyssa is a lie and isn't a god after all.
---
Ooh, so this is where they got the inspiration for the colour scheme from.
---
Yeah, same with PvE. If you play with people that don't try to get better and only want to get carried for easy rewards, or with toxic people that flame you on every little mistake, then it's not fun.
---
This seems like a more plausible situation to me judging the timing. Maybe said event connect to the new raid like they did for w5 but that remains to be seen.
---
Ofcourse.. ;p 
---
Would tie into the Zafirah silhouette, if thats what one of the other two really is, since she is a priestess (of Balth).
---
Surely there will be a PvE equivalent mount with multiple gem store skins? A tiger mount or something? 
---
It sounds so cool that it's inevitable, right?
---
Gain 3 seconds of super speed when entering in combat as additional effect (after applying % increase). That would be interesting, imo.
---
&gt; Any thoughts on the concept?
---
It's never going to come back because Arenanet is currently working on a change to WvW that will completely eliminate server affiliation. Once that's done, the concept of a "server" or "world" will no longer exist anywhere in the game.
---
I don't think that's how it will go. Aurene, will probably fight Kral in the Mists. Also, there's a possibility that she will use Joko's magic somehow. Just resurrecting her will be anti-climatic in my opinion. I hope they won't go that way. Death should have meaning. 
---
Good to know you liked it... ^^
---
Yeah after i was done with the Utility skills and posted this i regreted some skill usage of Ghosts. Instead you can make them Occupied, instead of spending them to Purgatory. Like a healing skill that makes a Ghost channel a healing skill at you (like Ranger Troll Salva healing). 
---
I whanned to make a Holy trinity around the ghosts.
---
And as a Bonus for your liking, i will sneak my next project. And Engi-spec with staff, and the staff is long range weapon. 
---
There's no problem with it being usable in PvE. WvW'ers don't really do PvE as much - or they do but its not favored. I was only thinking it won't be as, idk, efficient? Of course it will be usable but since its made with WvW in mind with the heavy armor and abilities I don't think it will have much impact on PvE other than being fun to run around on as you put it yeah.
---
You mean just like mounts in PvE too? 
---
"But what about the lag!!!!!1!11!!one!!!"
---
Why don't these people get a better internet connection? I have very mediocre speeds, and I barely get any lag at all.

I found it via buildapcsales, I thought it said 4 cores somewhere in one of the descriptions but now I'm looking again... here's the link from reddit:

How did it ruin GW1 lore? Maybe Dhuum just remembered to do leg day over the last 200 years
---
&gt; Will likely be brought back when (if) they ever finish making guild based WvW IE alliances.
---
Once the WvW alliance system is finished, there will no longer be any world affiliations anywhere in the game. The ability to "transfer to a different server" will cease to exist. This WvW change is just the completion of Megaservers.
---
&gt; Taking supply camps, towers, keeps or a castle has no meaning.
---
I love most of the rest you write, but here you are mistaken. As you write this for new players: taking camps, towers and keeps are a good source of experience, and you need that to rank up.
---
Getting higher ranks gives you, up to some point, the ability to spend ranking points to gain abilities. Those essentially make you more effective. And there is a non-zero chance (I would even say it's likely) that you will need to spend some of those ranking points to get the mount, or at least some of its abilities. So: taking objectives like camps, towers and so on does count.
---
It's actually funny because many "WvW mains" are the ones with incredible high playtime. Players who played gw2 for 25000 hours (most of playtime in WvW) are not that rare.
---
Thanks, but you still left out your old one for comparison.  
---
Maybe this release will bring WvW to 2013 polulation levels, even if temporary.
---
Good on you for turning the mount drama into something positive and constructive. 
---
Oh, and I want to say my current pc is an i7 4770, I bought it in 2013 or 2014 and been looking to replace it for about a year. 
---
They could make us buy the mount using some WvW currency, but then make us spend ranking points on mount abilities.
---

---
"Then at the boss, instead spawning many Jade Colossi, there would be alternating tentacles and jade colossi in phases that can go much faster if the party is skilled."
---
I highly doubt that point. Take a look at snowblind. Before the rework you could melt the wall faster. By continuously igniting the fire with stacked might.
---
Now it's timegated.. it can only go slower if you don't pay attention.
---
&gt; what about the hundreds of other players that play WvW and don’t have the dlc are now left out because everyone else has a mount
---
I am pretty sure I know ANets recommendation for them. :)
---
When you put it this way, yes. You are clearly right.
---
Uuuh fancy
---
Well, selfish f\*\*\*s who hate farming gifts of battle but gotta do it try to push their point of view to make stuff more appealing to them.
---
I’m very very suspicious.
---
What if it’s the Fall of Abaddon fractal?
---
I hope so, but negativity is easily spread, much easier than positivity. So if a bunch of people portray things to be grim, thats how its perceived by the majority then and discourages people. It really isn't so bad though, but yeah I do hope some people will genuinely consider giving it a chance as its very much a love it or hate it gamemode! 
---
Skimmed through it a bit, but yeah. Great guide for new people. Thanks for helping them out! :)
---
Yeah I don't expect many to read it fully hahaha, thanks!
---
&gt;and they nerfed it
---
I mean people were farming it *without* actually playing. That could be seen as unintentional.
---
Rank 100 or even 150 sounds fine to me, but 1000 might be a bit of a stretch.. remains to be seen though!
---
Cannot be a Necro player unless you play a truly dead class, amirite?
---
It displays dps after 20% of golem HP damage is done.
---
Why is it so important to get the new mount within several days, or at all? It took me a few months to unlock the roller beetle because I rarely play PvE but it didn't take any joy from me :)
---
&gt;Chrono mains need to spend 400 gold for a new gear stat set.

No problem.

---
Isn't arah the capitol of Orr?
---
Oh I've been playing off and on again since then! It deterred me at first but I wanted a change of pace, so I started to learn more and kept at it.
---
My comment regarding it being half a year (since first starting into WvW) and not knowing what I did wrong was supposed to be a jab at that Commander, that instead of helping me learn from my mistake I still wasn't 100% sure what had her so ticked. Since posting this yesterday, some people have commented or even PM'd me to explain what might have went down, and I understand it better now. I now run a Berserker/Maruader mix into WvW and can kill these Veteran Guards in a couple hits, but a lot of it was self-taught or looking up guides, and finding my own "recipe" since I tend to roam quite a bit.
---
And I've begun enjoying WvW as a nice change of pace from PvE. It almost feels like an entirely different game at times! But while I stuck through it, I can't imagine a first experience like that is a good thing for gaining and retaining us "casual PvErs." Thank you for reaching out and providing another viewpoint!
---
I love it
---
As far as I've seen, GW2 heavily relies on a single Thread (as you've mentioned), and most people report 3 cores to be actually used properly (like, not just one-digit usage percentage).    
---
So yeah, as you've said, you want to look mainly at the single thread performance. According to benchmark sites, the 8700 is roughly 25% faster at those than the 4770. Then there is also [this comparison by a Reddit user who upgraded his pc](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7n70yz/guild_wars_2_performance_test_cpu_upgrade/), which while not using the exact same cpus (from an i5 4670k, which should be roughly the same performance in GW2 as the 4770k, which in turn should be a little bit faster than your 4770 to a 8700k, which is roughly 5-10% faster than the 8700), can be seen as a rough estimate. You can see there that the user had around a 30% increase in fps in most parts of the game after the upgrade.   
---
Following these tests (and not having done any myself, so they may be false, but I kinda trust them), I'd say: yeah, upgrading your 4770 to a 8700 will be a noticeable improvement.
---
Because I am sure lot of players safing those WvW daily potions (250 points each) and if u play Zerg. The one half have it, the other half not.. it could get messy.
---
Since it's anet it will be more likely something like this:
---
Signet of Inspiration now removes all boons from nearby allies. Increased cooldown by 30 seconds. Increased scepter damage by 0.01 % 
---
This is awesome. You got skills OP! 
---
Has anyone gotten actually attacked for posting links to his art? What the fuck?
---
It might be a good idea for people to go get themselves the TS/discord and get verified before tuesday as there will be a lot going on. Also getting in over the weekend might not be a terrible idea as you can find out some basics of wvw without the huge rush of people and you can work on your wvw rank, get daily pots which you can save up for tracks and get some skirmishing tickets/badges of honor for if you need to buy the mount with wvw currencies and these should help towards the mount as long as it isn't a collection.
---
3 months without posting and this is what you chose to.. "contribute"?
---
Nothing is unreasonable
---
I started a Chrono recently and still suck badly at it, but I killed quite a few roaming Necros already. They are my favourite enemy for now, since I am confident to win against them. &lt;3
---
In zergs they are deadly tho, hands down
---
Ah yes, a strawman, very argumentative, good job
---
See, I’ve tried playing WvW a lot. Roaming, and running around with the tag but I don’t understand how to enjoy it. Am I missing something? It’s just not fun to me.
---
Can other teams see /mapchat or is it just your color?
---
My worries are that the new mount can be used instead of siege (if I'm going by what's shown in the video). I don't see a way to implement this without toppling over fundamental concepts of WvW (supply / stationary siege / expensive golems). That makes it definitely a risky move that's hard to get right. What makes me about unhappy about this is that with a little experience, it's easy to navigate all WvW maps fast (learning Tangled Depths is imho harder). That's why I believe it's mostly beginners asking for mounts in WvW.
---
Fixing all the bugs that come with the the new mount takes resources away from other WvW optimizations. Just a few small things that would be nice: you can blink up some stairs but not others (I know them by heart, but it has been annoying me for years), the corners with the skritt / centaur events in alpine borderlands could be used for something more interesting, necropolis in DBL still is extremely hard to defend due to the skewed walls (the cataspot on top of the sentry is fine though). They could also spend some energy on how to prevent misguided tactics use (the classical "who pulled the EWP?!?" situation) or add more wvw guild missions. This is all besides the usual criticism that the current zerg meta has been reduced to three classes, or that the AOE spam is still hard to deal with. I don't want to begin with engine changes that optimize the lag or let us hide auras / weapons. Those are always hard because they change critical parts of the game.
---
Just to be clear: I'm definitely grateful for any progress the WvW team makes, I just know they are a small team that has a lot on their plate and I believe they are going in the wrong way. Let them prove me wrong ^ ^
---
Map chat is for the current map that you are on, but no its only tied to your server, nobody else outside your server will see it :)
---
I am 10k wvw rank and my general response is:
---
- Mount is a cool idea, I can do cowboy leading for a few days
---
- however It won't Fix any problems Within WvW
---
- Combat is way too unbalanced and people die way Too Fast
---
- having mounts will give Too Much advantage to Defenders kinda like gliding and claim Buff and tactics did.
---
I don't mind the update however I would like the Alliance system to come out soon. I Believe People Are over exaggerating about How much the change actually is. 
---
I Believe they should Buff all Health by fifty percent and see What does to the wvw, it doesn't need similar balance as pvp. Damage is just too High in both Guild and Blob fights. People don't have time to think or make big plays.
---
he's just being salty about the megathread and trolling

---
nobody cares about your backseat moderating tbh
---
**for the first time in history, negative things about gw2 are being up voted** 
---
Indeed, and your point is not an argument against mine. It's a fine statement, but misplaced as a reply.
---
I remember that a dev once compared the realms of the gods to a disk with 6 sections, each section for a god, to explain how the the Realm of Torment had been disconnected from them, as if it was a section of a disc splitting from the rest.  
---
Of course, since the mists aren't in 3D space, it's likely just a way to picture it, not the actual way they are, but it could also be a way to represent it in-game. 
---
Divinity's Reach was probably inspired in that concept too. 
---
It would be cool if we got a new map that represents the 'point' at which the 6 sections join, where the gods could have had their meetings and such.  
---
Maybe it could be a rework of the Edge of the Mists or the eternal battlegrounds, having the same overall layout, but cooler and more varied looks and a few improvements, and the castle's lord and the theme of the castle replaced with a random god avatar every time the controlling world changes.  
---
The events with the Riftstalkers have shown us they can make dynamic changes to maps now, so it could be possible.
---
It sometimes may not be, sometimes the tag well may themselves be boring (shh), sometimes commanders at least on my server play drunk or sing along just to have fun and spice things up haha. Its all about finding the right company and friends/guild that you like tbh. Can even just be one friend and not a whole horde of people, but playing alone I've found its not nearly as fun
---
oh boy
---
&gt;Often, you won't get replies to your questions quickly - remember that much of the time, people are busy playing and talking to people in voice comms and not reading the chatbox. Add to that the fact that /map is (for the reason previously mentioned) often used for expressing frustrations and teasing one another, you will find that many players don't prioritise reading it.
---
For sure. I would say that I misrepresented things, as my memory was off a bit. It was a bit more than 3 minutes later. I was with my wife and we were running around aimlessly for awhile (maybe an hour? time kinda flies when we play :P)
---
&gt;I'm sorry that your experience was sub-par. The quality of community varies per server.
---
Thanks, yeah it was not very welcoming. I probably could have excused the lack of communication and toxicity if the game was a bit better at guiding me. However, I just could not figure out what to do at all. I don't remember feeling this lost when I last played (~5 years ago), so I am not sure if they changed something to make it less obvious, or if I am just getting old and stupid :P
---
I wouldn't use the gazelle, I find that the charge attack it does bug out sometimes and it rams off to the other end of the map (exaggeration, but true) and misses the target. 
---
Like I said I mainly use my druid staff to tag and the glyphs for extra damage, so I don't really pay attention to the pets.
---
Was gonna make a lambskin joke then I remembered that's also slang for a condom which just opens up a whole new avenue of whatthefuckery
---
I find the glyphs helpful in GH when the champs spawn in clusters of separate location. I pop one or both to make sure I hit the 2 or 3 that spawn at the first corner, then staff #3 myself quickly to the other corner to make sure I can tag enough dps on rest.
---
oh thats all the damage you have to do? thats sweet. 
---
Again, mounts change nothing in this respect, except make all these listed tasks shorter. You're saying it like only one side will only have mounts.
---
Every single veteran of WvW, especially those of us who have been playing it since launch, know exactly what it looks like when the gamemode is healthy and receiving attention, because even though infrequently, it has happened. After the desert borderland update backlash and the change in leadership soon after, regular WvW players got links to surveys in their mail so the devs had direction on what they should do to make us happy. They listened and implemented the feedback, which was great. The announcing of the alliance system was great and something players had been suggesting for years. 
---
The problem is after these tiny moments where we get a glimpse of what we’ve been suggesting, there is just silence for a year+. WvW is extremely fun to play with a regular group, and there are few things more depressing than watching the “last online” date of members of your group reach farther into the past.
---
I know some posts on here may seem like we just hate the devs and blame them for everything and will never be happy, but it truly comes from a place of being passionate about the gamemode and wanting to improve it. And having bug/exploit fixes or PvE parity thrown in your face as “new content” as opposed to the bare minimum of acceptable development work gets frustrating.
---
Lastly, on the topic of complaints not being “specific,” I work as a software engineer and an important thing to know in product development is that client usually has **no idea** what the best solution to their problem is, the product team’s job is to listen to complaints and *develop* a good solution from all angles. This is why product owners and ux designers exist. If someone says “it’s too confusing to use,” we don’t say “shut up that’s not a real complaint because you don’t provide a solution.” The ux designer is the expert that can try to solve that problem. This idea that we are supposed to be experts on how to balance a game before we can critique it is ridiculous.
---
Your statement is false. While Kormir was a human, Grenth never was. He was half-human. We dont know what the other gods were before becoming gods, presuming that they weren't born as gods which we honestly don't know either. As proven by Abaddon, the gods can alter their bodies. Some may have made their body more humanlike to be relatable by humans.
---
Given that the Spirits of tje Wild are also tied to the afterlife, particularly Raven to the Underworld, the act of calling them the "realm of the gods" in no way prescribes the notion that the gods made those afterlife, but rather that they commandeered them. Adter all, souls had to go somewhere before the Six arriced and as proven by the Mad Realm and Domain of the Lost (and even FoW and RoT in gw1), all races go to the so called realm of the gods. However, as per the Domain of the Lost again, the gods can also move any race's soul to other places.
---
Most likely the gods just laid claim to certain parts of the afterlife that always existed and kicked non-devotees out.
---
There is zero reason to believe the portions of the Mists bordering Tyria, the afterlife and borderlands that make up WvW, was made by the Six.
---
Nor does that at all relate to anything I said about the Mists manipulating one's perspective of time.
---
Fun is a very personnal thing, I had fun with meta build, but right now i'm playing banners soldier gs core warrior on raid, and it's kinda fun.
---
I played alot of mmorpg's. Since 1999. Im type of hardcore player. And yes - IMO GW2 is very skill based game. Of course you can play as noob and achieve everything. But at the same time you can master your gameplay for years and became pro.
---
It could be fun. My ranger was my main, too. Now it is a thief, but I am gearing my Mesmer now. It is kinda fun and fresh to start a new class.
---
I think the megathread was to remove the crapposts, this obviously isn't a crappost and is beneficial to players and WvW adoption. 
---
Also, Is reddit not the BEST place to post your opinion? Otherwise we would just read Wikipedia.
---
Just a reminder, if a commander is running a stealth blast comp, they may ask you to not follow because you’ll telegraph their movements if you don’t have stealth. Normally they won’t be the only commander on map, so be respectful and help them kill enemies by staying off their group and for the love of siegerazor, don’t drop light fields. *cringes in area cleanse* 
---
Well thats a preference yeah, roaming for some (myself including) doesn't give you a lot of rewards - then again its rewarding on how you can stomp down someone so really it just depends. I do admit I personally suck at it so I prefer to contribute zerging haha
---
Bravo, good on you for writing this up. All great info. 
---
I meant holiday events...Squeezing an  episode between Halloween and Wintersday would've been awkward...
---
Greth is suspected to be Malchor's and Dwayna's son, and he  ascended to godhood  after defeating Dhuum in what's now the Ossuary. 
---
Dhuum can't be destroyed like Abaddon was, so they sealed him, but it's clear that at that point Grenth took a sizable chunk of his power and became a full god. 
---
I couldn't deal with grim people were painting WvW to be honestly, its very infectious - thanks! Some I had to pull from other threads, but theres definitely more info out there for those who want to do some digging. Now i can finally go finish my work as I got caught up writing this xd 
---
yeah, for a newbie all one needs to know about tactivator levers is that they exist and shall not be used. Probably the most benign is "supply drop" that may be used if supplies are empty. I also believe that all who want to stay in WvW after this "newbie period" may want to try a dragon banner. 
---
The Owl Shrine events in Snowden Drift are bugged on EU at the moment too (since last night). So anyone working on Nevermore is stuck. Multiple people have flown in and sent reports, but I guess we'll just have to wait until Tuesday's patch.
---
For a minute there the thumbnail looked like you'd drawn his head mounted like a trophy :o
---
To mark good spots for trebs, cats etc. At range, line of site, stuff like that. There are some places commonly known by experienced wvwers. Just want to do markers for my own reference.
---
I'm not 100% sure, but I think it marks enemies near it so that you can see them on the map
---
I hear you! I'm an old roamer so I tend to get salty easy, but I try not to. I don't care one way or the other about the mount. I care about balance patches, communication and the company I support with my dollars supporting my game modes (roaming, PvP).
---
Regardless, good attitudes can be infectious, so you deserve your gold!
---
I'll just say this: The criticism towards Anet is justified and well deserved, no one is pointing out at any specific developer, and being a company they must be ready to face criticism and consequences, something they've so faw shown they're unable to, and that's what causes games to die.
---
You can't ignore that GW2 sales are at its lowest for quite some time, GW2's revenue is similar to Aion's, an asian MMO which significantly lost power and popularity. It's even confirmed we're not getting an expansion after the end of LWS4.
---
People are complaining because it's quite evident that there's been a decline, and any and all criticism towards the game are, even the most respectful ones, are either shut down in the forums for no reason whatsoever, or by the same playerbase with posts like these which magically, in the span of some minutes, get reddit gold, platinum, and hundreds (if not thousands) of upvotes which ironically contradict the feelings of the users, which can usually be seen in the comments.
---
Anet's design model has been terrible for the long term health of the game and it has nothing to do with the fact that it's 6 years old. WoW is older and despite its flaws is still going strong and steady, and FFXIV is close to GW2's age and is stronger than never. GW2, as I've stated before, is developed as a fast food game, which you get for a couple hours of entertainment and you move away, when it's supposed to be an MMO. The development cycle is about producing small, short term solutions for player enjoyment which later on become abandoned, thus the game slowly becomes a collection of ghost towns, glitched dungeons and events, and looks unpolished, rushed, and lonely.
---
We've expressed our concerns regarding the lack of meaningful rewards, the current state and abandonment of vanilla content, the re use of assets for PVE modes, the lack of general balance, lack of attention in PVP and WVW modes, our worries about the abandonment of LW maps... And we've been shut down or completely ignored, which of course causes unrest and people screaming "dead game".
---
I invite you to look at other AAA MMO reddits and compare how many unrest you find there compared to here. Anet, for years, has been brooming the trash under the bed and putting long, pretty bedsheets over it to hide stuff; but as the trash piles up, it becomes more evident that no matter how fancy the sheets they use to cover it, it starts reeking and coming out from beneath.
---
Also, a lot of servers have the tags color-coded, and info on it is usually contained in their TS/Discord/forums. So don't go blazing on a commander if they kick you from a guild raid. 
---
That's pretty much what I said. Grenth was a half-human half-god. Not a full human like you were claiming is the case for all gods.
---
And it isn't that Dhuum can't be killed. It's that Grenth wasn't strong enough to do so.
---
Discord IS mandatory if you intend to follow a pugmander. You can join on your browser, takes little effort so no excuses should be given. Even easier compared to changing builds. 
---
The builds on metabattle are just a general guideline; you do not have to adhere to the exact stats strictly, simply have more marauder/cavalier for more survivability or berserker for more damage (for power based builds).
---
General combat tips:
---
If the enemy zerg stealths within 1200 range of your zerg (commonly using [veil](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Veil) or blasting stealth), turn 180 degrees. Any decent commander will either tell you to turn left or right or reverse when the enemy stealths because the enemy zerg is either faking a push or is about to bomb your zerg. If the enemy is faking a push and you go back with your zerg, nothing bad happens. If the enemy is about to bomb your zerg and you reverse, you have just avoided the enemy zerg's bomb.
---
Check whether your party has a firebrand for stability because whether you have it or not will greatly dictate the way you should play. If you do have [stability](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stability), when the commander pushes, you should follow the commander. If you do not have stability, then following the commander blindly will just result in a free kill since you will be CCed to death. Do try and follow in the general direction of the zerg however as that is where all the heals will be.
---
Evade through the pulsing red circles when pushing: these are scourge shades that will corrupt your stability and you will be CC-ed to death. Do not sit in these for too long and for no reason no matter how tanky you think you are. 
---
Don't click your skills. Don't keyboard turn. 
---
Why? Raid = PvE, PvE = 6 mounts
---
So they have mounts. Six of them. They can even use them in the PoF raids.
---
And don't forget to stow your minis, please
---
Staying on tag is extremely extremely important, even if you see an enemy off to the side that you want to tag. Theres a chance that the other teams may be waiting around a corner and slam you. In short: your commander jumps off a cliff, so do you.
---
When you fight and win your first outnumbered fight, that's when I enjoyed wwv.
---
&gt; Am I missing something? It’s just not fun to me.
---
well, what else in the game *is* fun to you?
---
The thing is that extra mobility isn't gonna solve any of the underlying and accumulating problems WvW has. It already stomps over mobility runes that were added just a couple patches ago, and it keeps up neglecting the bigger damage that needs to be fixed in WvW. It's like having pneumonia and having the doctor put a band aid on your shoulder.
---
If you wan't to get a bit involved, ask for your server vocal in map chat so you can follow your commander orders and ask questions if you want. 
---
(Even if you don't wan't to talk, you can just listen like the majority of people in there.)
---
Watchtower puts "marked" on all enemies as long as they are in certain range from the tower, making them visible to the owner server of the watchtower as red dots on minimap.
---
Perfectly encapsulates much of the starting knowledge a player will need, thank you for posting!
---
The spinal blade backpack is indeed still craftable. It is a multistage process and uses an account bound material, [blade shards](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blade_Shard) that you can acquire from a variety of sources. 
---
You begin with the [spinal pack](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Spinal_Blade_Pack) and gradually upgrade it to the final form (color) you want.
---
&gt;i dont think mounts are a bad thing as long as they dont add bright sparkling skins, wvw is already a clusterfuck with visual noise.
---
What if I told you that's exactly why we're getting mounts? Gams gems gems!
---
Also, this is the period prior to re-links.  Relinks are affected by WvW activity.  To get a stronger link, some host servers will tank their WvW activity to cause the algorithm to believe they are lower activity than they actually are - hence, assign a higher active link (a 'stronger' link).  You may be experiencing this on SBI.   It would be coordinated among the guilded groups on that server, and so not be truly representative of the actual activity you'll see after relinks.
---
According to the wiki, F6 is unbound by default
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Controls
---
&gt; So now you see difference between gw2 and other mmorpg's. In numbers.
---
Except that may not be the right thing to judge them by. You're speaking *only* in raid bosses, not encounters, PvE work, or other changes. WoW and FFXIV are both vertical progression games, and the *progression* part of that is much heavier handed than it ever will be in GW2.
---
That's not an excuse or appeal to praise ANet, it's an Apples to Unicycles problem.
---
&gt; Also heres no schedules and we dont know what to expect from arenanet.
---
Absolutely correct. And that's a **HUGE** problem, but again, the frequency of actual updates means it's an issue with expectation setting, not delivery.
---
Huge amounts of things with the game have been mishandled due to communications, *not just* delivery.
---
&gt; Because even if arenanet wake up... Noone trust them anymore. After 7 years of bad decisions. They had enough time
---
Depends on which side of the bed they wake up on, imo. There is always a right and wrong communication strategy, and my gut says they'll choose the wrong one, but there *is* value in being optimistic about things until proven wrong as well.
---
Have traded with Yender before. He's an MVP.
---
I would imagine that Anet might place some sort of zone cap limit on to how many Warclaw's are allowed to be mounted at a time. This would make them more of a siege tool than anything else.
---
Like, think of it. Lets say that Anet sets the zone cap to...12 warclaws at a time. This is spread across all 3 factions. So, at most, in 1 specific zone, 1 factions could have 12 warclaws. But the amount each faction could have would constantly be changing due to people getting dismounted, moving/leaving zones, and the like.
---
If something like this isn't implemented into their inclusion in WvW....well then that is another story. 
---
Thanks! Let me go buy them out and re-post them for a higher value. =]
---
The problem is ANet removed any incentive for wanting to win by getting rid of world bonuses for having high scores.
---
It does to me, I only fight enemies that look fabulous!
---
It's been right around that price range for a while now...
---
Anyone can put upgrades in, you just want a guild that has all stat upgrades available claiming.
---
I suspect so because that does make him a dad
---
And isn't that how Anet solves stuff with every game mode? Introduce a new shiny that brings players for a couple months (at most), then letting it die.
---
Sorry, I just realized you were asking about the website's short stories, not the in-game story.
---
Not sure when they'll continue, but hopefully soon.  I imagine they want to release them all before the next episode launches, so hopefully my answer helped a little?
---
Oops. But I mean, like all skyrim enemies say, "you'll make a fine rug, cat!" I bet.
---
I just got back into GW2. I quit just before HOT and had tons of fun with Silverwastes stuff. I’m back now with HOT and POF. Started POF to get a raptor and working on the springer mount per someone’s suggestion, then I’m planning on stopping and starting HOT for chronology.
---
Couple questions:
---
1. I almost maxed out Berserker on my Warrior and I’m finding it lackluster. I guess I imagined it would fundamentally change the character. Torch offhand is a bit underwhelming too. Any cool tips for folks who like this class?
---
2. I’m getting my ass handed to me in POF doing it solo. I heard Hero Points are hard to solo, but why am I getting wrecked in Story Missions? I don’t have a guild and I’m not usually the type of person to ask for help. Is there something I’m missing gear- or ability-wise? 
---
3. I’ve been wearing the same exotic gear I’ve always had. Is there a need to work upwards towards new gear quality, or is it still Fashion Wars at this point with the expansions? I’m not counting Ascended gear, as it’s kind of more of a commitment.
---
4. What’s the best way to handle loot? I’m looking for tips on what to salvage and what to sell. I used to have a system that worked before but I know how meta changes. I have a parked Level 53 I used to open bags on. Is it still optimal to acquire those materials and sell them on the TP?
---
Thanks in advance! 
---
This is very helpful, thanks for putting in the effort! I've adjusted the mega thread description to clarify it's purpose - which isn't to limit this type of thread. 
---
Actually, they had some people testing these.  So, I think they did some homework.  Imagine the WvWers testing thought through these likely scenarios.   But, only time and more information will tell. 
---
\*How\* tome nerf
---
That's a good and reasonable guide.
---
It's been like that for a while, the chaos weapons are all in high demand and it was a while since you could last buy them.
---
They've said 'no new maps', but we can dream. 
---
Its cool xD
---
Well, everything is just speculation...or a poor attempt to bait some ANET designers to hint it :D
---
Thank you \^\^
---
A rank 100 requirement would exclude new players from participating in zergs for a long time if the mount is faster than running with swiftness...
---
Yeah that'd be a great way to do the collections like krait and grawl!
---
They are probably mad that Anet dared to invest some time into "content" that is not exclusively for them. And now tell us to be grateful for it.
---
I'm not against the mount btw. We'll see how it turns out. But I *hate* the attitude a lot of PvE players shown these days.
---
Satisfies the completionists among us
---
There are no guarantees of life in WvW.  
---
Thanks for this! i will add a redirect to your thread from mine as they seem to be similar and equally helpful!

I can't offer you much in terms of PvP builds, but if you're looking for something that feels fun, mobile and action packed for PvE, I can strongly recommend this [Sinister Dodge Holosmith](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vdAQJAqanUUB9dh1aB+ZBcJjF2CbsNMG+CgfoNQAovNGHrjA-jxxHQB0SPAGVCiL1fm1DAYC7PAgTAguU+FAIB4mKeAw4Jein4JeiHXn4Jein4Jein4Jein4RKAYWWB-e), built around the concept of dodge rolling for burn application and fast reuse of Prime Light Beam via the Power Wrench trait. It's also somewhat raid viable, nothing that's going to regularly get top DPS, but it can keep up with the meta builds reasonably well.
---
Thanks for the effort! I've adjusted the megathread description to clarify it's purpose - this is the kind of post that deserves it's own thread. 
---
Pedantry aside, story mode doesn't give currency, so the point still stands.
---
Those 'Mongoloids' are more thanlikely new players who dont know what they're doing. So bitching and whining about them and calling them mongoloids is only going to discouraged them from playing and learning.
---
Thats why.
---
same as ghastly grinning shield, people holding out to drive prices up. BULLSHIT! &lt;3
---
If it's anything like the PvE mounts, it'll probably only have a few thousand health. So yeah, portable rams, but ones that should be very susceptible to AoEs.
---
Daddy Trombone was never more relevant 
---
I do as I please with my soldier gear death magic minion master! You're not my mom!
---
Lol what about power classes outrageous damage. What you said should only be applied if power damage is cut in half atleast. 
---
&gt;	Well you pretty much describe World Bosses, which are more a shared solo fight than a group fight. They do drop some unique skins but as you wrote, the rewards are the killer.
---
Except world bosses aren't solo at all, so there's no real comparison. 
---
And to my knowledge, other than Teq, there's no unique skins tied to any world boss.
---
&gt;	most of the time you could not even do them with the 2-4 persons who showed up during the fight- was quite disappointing.
---
Real talk right here.
---
I need one bounty for a specialization collection. On three separate occasions, I've tried to get a group to do it, to no avail.
---
As much as people like to say "Just ask for help, and it's easy to get a group to accomplish anything in GW2, it's proving really frustrating to try to get a dozen people together to do one bounty in Vabbi. Whether joining others, tagging up myself, etc, while posting in lfg too...
---
I guess I just gotta wait till I'm on and Vabbi bounty is a daily.
---
Totally agree on this point.  REDBL, the joy of trying to move around that monstrosity without open waypoints.  And the traverse in AlpineBLs was improved by accessibility to gliding and captured territories.  So much better, despite those saying it wasn't needed. 
---
&gt; Did you know...that Balthazar himself forged the chains that bound the fallen god, Abaddon, in the Realm of Torment? 
---
oh-ooohh
---
Reddit has a tp bot posting random prices and supply?
---
Abilities are described in this article https://www.mmogames.com/gamenews/guild-wars-2-wvw-mount-warclaw-announced/
---
Ehhh, as a roamer I'd say 60/40 in terms of importance out of/in combat respectively. The extra MS helps with kiting, disengage and even micropositioning myself more quickly to pull off a burst (such as playing DH and walking across Test of Faith more quickly so I can pull a tethered opponent across it). The main reason I've always ended up going back to +25% MS runes in the past is because I could feel the difference, like when trying to take a camp, realizing I'd be outnumbered, then fleeing/kiting those who chase successfully without getting run down, or more easily walking out of aoes. 
---
"When PvE players want mounts"
---
"Anet puts a mount in a cancer format filled with stealth deadeyes and daredevils and 8+ sec invulnerability warriors that shave off 2/3 of your health in one burst".
---
Its all about getting people interested imo, even if mine is more helpful people need to be willing to ask stuff and read it hehe
---
Definitely more interesting.  Just as gliding made things more interesting, I'm think these mounts will do same.  Looking forward to seeing what happens as the WvW players embrace them.   
---
Right, I guess that's why the power herald "buffs" last patch to make it not garbage in PvE actually gutted them since they massively increased OH sword's cast time and didn't split it, courtesy of WvW/sPVP QQ on heralds.
---
While I don't feel the need to make a separate thread I wanted to add a comment here: There are WvW guilds out there that will help you out. Many of us truly want to see folks succeed and spend the vast majority of our time training new people. I look at myself and others I know who do that work as community organizers in order to get more people into the game mode we adore. :)  My own recruiting efforts are easy enough to find and don't need to be replicated here. Just understand that I see that WvW needs a constant stream of new people coming in and this thread will assist in that! Welcome. If you have any further questions please ask here too. 
---
Well I’ve never changed it, so maybe the wiki needs updated.
---
We will see.
---
Ill tell you meta builds for FUN XD
---
Pve: heal scourge
---
Pvp and Wvw:  Heal or tank scrapper, Warrior40khpFullBlock tank.
---
&gt; type what's going on 
---
For example:
---
\[Ascension Bay\] 25+ cata spot wall at 50%
---
&gt;	Nah thats just some shittalk going on, it really isnt it.
---
You're entitled to your opinion but just saying "no u" doesn't do anything to change mine.
---
Ever since I decided to give WvW a try 2-3 years ago, then left, came back again with the "right" build and gear, then left, then came back to grind out my Gift of Battle...each time, WvW, both the game mode itself and the people, have left me disliking it more and more...to the point that now I generally can't talk about it without shitting on it, and if they decided to scrap the entire mode tomorrow, I'd do a happy dance.
---
Just seems like a part of the game that brings out the worst in its adherents and is uniquely opaque and difficult to break into.
---
If you like the idea of range on the ranger, I also suggest having an axe weapon swap with an off hand of your choosing since axe aa bounces. 
---
Celestial guard can work because they do so much damage because of boosts from the zeal and radiance trait lines.  
---
This seems quite low from my experience, but it’s good that at least you documented it.
---
You get an advatage since you don't need to remember the positions and can share them with your squad.
---
Using Taco to get a such an advantage in WvW in not like using it for easier JP.  I doubt Anet allow it.
---
Probably just another disappoint which will leave half the subreddit complaining and waiting for the next patch LUL
---
Especially if you have some experience in sPvP. It's probably the only part of the game which transfers over from any other game mode. Zerg fight comps don't look anything like PvE (most people won't run glass) and usually not like PvP (maybe some bunker builds are similar but it's still a different beast).
---
Roaming is very similar to sPvP, with an added emphasis on mobility (engaging/catching a target, escaping when outnumbered), so if that's your usual game mode, feel free to try it out in WvW.
---
50k rapid fire balans comrade   
---
Wait sorry wrong game 
---
Generate excitement.  Introduce something new.  Invite players to consider WvW for the first time.  Just look at all this discussion.  People haven't been talking WvW this much in a long time. And look... new posts about how to engage in WvW as a new player to WvW.   Some people going to pop in and then back out.  Some going to discover this game mode and stick.  Everyone still pining away for the 'good old days' going to play and maybe get pleasantly surprised, or just keep on keeping on, wishing they could turn back the clock.   Can't wait to get one on Tuesday!
---
IIRC there were also a build-in markers (or separated pack) fetching data from API and showing how much time left till object is flippable for your server - not sure if these are showing correct time now
---
I hope it won't be difficult to unlock, I'm I the middle of trying to get all PoF mounts already.
---
I am memeing every single stereotype this update that hasn't even been released has brought to the sub.
---
May I touch?
---
Well me saying 'it really isn't it' isnt meant to change your opinion, its more meant to give you the other side of the coin if you will, for you to consider. You can still decide not to like the gamemode thats totally fine. 
---
Its all about the people as I said, maybe your server is more toxic than others - this happens too and well thats the sad truth really, not much can be done about it. But its not like that for everyone and people arent always mean. But yeah maybe this whole negative conditioning has just left you wanting to shit on it every time, it is what it is. its hard to get out of that spot unless you come across the right circumstances and people and see it in a different light :) 
---
I use it not just for this, but for REALLY tricky mesmer portals aswell. It is very useful if you know how to create custom markerpacks, etc.
---
Which has nothing to do with mounts. And besides may not be easy to fix - the players cannot possibly know if it is even feasible without reworking the whole back-end. 
---
im happy to help you even in game, feel free to inbox me here for my account name if you like! 
---
It depends on the theme of your character and which one matches your theme. Personally, my favorite is "The Crossing" since the lantern actually has physics. But Azimuth is nice too if you want something more elegant. 
---
thats great! please feel free to ask questions about related stuff or situations you have encountered in game that you didnt know what to do :) maybe its illuminating for others too
---
And please do ask in questions here about stuff you are curious about, we do appreciate the enthusiasm ^^
---
And please do ask in questions here about stuff you are curious about, we do appreciate the enthusiasm ^
---
I've actually seen a fair few WvW'ers with good opinions of the mount system. And while I can see the positives, I must say I do hold reservations (as you might tell from the vid!)
---
It definitely goes on sale quite often so keep an eye out for that
---
If you are a tourist to WvW please respect the locals/regulars. You may have 1000 hours in gws but the locals have 1000 hours in WvW. Act accordingly.
---
I don't kick people playing Reaper from any training runs I do and my static hasn't had problems with people playing Reaper on power bosses during our W1 to W6 clears. Yes it doesn't benchmark well but if a reaper isn't putting out enough dps for a boss to be killed there is probably some other underlying issue such as incorrect gear, incorrect rotation or not being familiar with mechanics.
---
Maybe other groups are less kind but I think there are more important things to deal with during a raid than someone playing Reaper on power appropriate bosses. 
---
I'll put it this way, in all the other subreddits of games that I play, I get nowhere near this many downvotes. Especially for asking a simple question to clarify something that I'm unsure of.
---
If I'm going to get this much hate over a question then I'm not sure this is a community that I want to be a part of. So I think I'll just hop back on next time a Living World Episode drops and go play a game where the community isn't made of salt.
---
He is not playing a special snowflake build. Snow Crows and Discretize, plus Metabattle all have meta builds for power reaper, and he seems to be following that, *plus* is asking whether or not he should. I respect that kind of initiative.
---
Your answer doesn't actually explain why reaper is undesirable, and honestly beyond a desire to sound smug I have no idea why you even bothered commenting. If you're going to be dickish with your answer, at least be informative.
---
&gt; They do not have to accommodate you.
---
Goes both ways; Don't let yourself get bullied into playing some unfun zerg build/prof because a borderline aspie "commander" wants to live out his power fantasy of commanding an army in battle.
---
If your starting out its best to go for a more tanky build, also the triumphant reward track will give you exotic stat selectable gear for things like minstrels.
---
also dont forget to spend your wvw level points, gliding, auto loot and the amount of supply you can carry a the mains ones you want 
---
re: mirror images, the target break behavior was only added with PoF. the only mechanic that broke target before was stealth.
---
it's not a stigma, reaper is just the worst dps class and the difference is big, logically nobody wants to play with them unless they don't care about the run going slow, and when sth runs slow then more mechanics can't be skipped. the faster you deal with a fight the safer it actually is apart from saving time. and anet doesn't want to fix necro, every patch nothing substantial happens. they even nerfed it last time when reaper was almost alright.
---
I hope they are taking away chronic ability to grant both alacrity and quickness to a group raid, just leaving one or the other, and address unique buffs like banners and spirits. Then they give those buffs, individuallly, to less popular PvE classes/specs like tempest, necro, and herald. For example, a herald that can put up might, fury, and the buff from frost spirit might all of a sudden become raid visible. In general, there needs to be more incentive to diversify, such as more recent rev/fb instead of Druid as healers in all comps. 
---
Because I can?
---
Try update your network/wifi network drivers in your device manager. It's a simple, semi-automated process but it cleared up some ping issues I was having for several weeks. Beyond that, google, a lot of people mention clearing files/cache stuff but I did not have much success with that personally (that's not to say it's incorrect).
---
Ok so from what im pulling from your last statement is there are bosses where playing a power reaper is going to be completely horrible regardless of rotation and what not? Is scourge acceptable on bosses like that? I just love reaper over core and scourge but will suck it up as long as there are opportunities to play reaper "effectively".
---
I've been running around Jahai collecting Mistonium for Requiem armour the last week or two, and there have been players around.  The thing about these maps is that you generally don't need tags.  With the exception of the Shatterer, there are no events that need the participation of most of the map.  If you're in Sandswept Isles or Kourna, you'll be able to see the state of the meta shown on the event status, so if the meta has progressed towards the end players will know to come and join even without a tag.
---
And, of course, you can also feel free to tag up yourself.  When I noticed the Argon Garrison event was up and put up my own tag to draw players for it for the shield skin, enough people came to finish the event.
---
Nah, that's it. If you don't enjoy it you can't do much about it. If you want that mount I'm afraid you will have to suffer through. There's not really much to WvW if it doesn't tickle your fancy.
---
Can you tell me more about invincible minion necro? Never tried to solo dungeons and this actually may bring me back into playing again. 
---
Literally godmode in open world content, subpar in competitive (fractal, raid) content.
---
Probably as much of a god as Balthazar, maybe not one of the 6 but definitely still godly.
---
prtsrn (aka print screen)
---
Use that button next time. Please.
---
Exactly. I play power reaper in raids and it's really not an issue. Obviously in pugs you're going to get people who insist on everything being optimal but in a static with friends or people who know your ability, nobody tends to mind.

I never though about running away lol. Kill 1 or 2 and run i guess, seems a little ridiculous but is a valid strat.

No problem fam, I also forgot to mention that dueling can be a great way to improve and learn the match ups.

Mistlock Instability: Vengeance inflicts weakness on yourself when you block an attack with aegis

---
My interpretation:
---
"Prophecy, Harmony, Totality" refers instead to Kralkatorrik's prophecy of harmony between dragons and mortals in a world where he is dead (totality).
---
"Hear us sing, unyielding, unwavering" is about the Zephyrites and the Commander's allies. They are attacking Kralkatorrik with song and sound, they are unyielding in their attack, they are unwavering in their determination to strive forward despite prophecies of potential doom.
---
"Luminous, Virtuous, Victorious" I feel refers specifically to Aurene, and the hope and prophecy of her victory.
---
&gt;Secondly, go ahead and reduce your graphics settings until they’re as bad as you can handle. I myself go into settings, set graphics to ‘best performance,’ and then bring up postprocessing to low and render sampling to native so my screen doesn’t look like mud. Otherwise, your computer won’t be able to handle huge teamfights very well. They’ll turn into powerpoints.
---
More importantly: 
---
* Character Model Limit
---
* Character Model Quality
---
Reducing the quality to Lowest or Low can dramatically improve your frame rate. Reducing the model limit can help as well, but you're going to have a harder time tracking enemies and absolutely need to have enemy nameplates enabled.
---
Power Reaper is a great raid spec when the rest of your team underperforms. In general, the better your team, the (relatively) worse Reaper performs.
---
Assuming perfect play, Reaper's top performance as a DPS role is about 80% of the highest possible DPS on Thief or Ele(Huge hitbox). You're trading that 20% for durability, good cleave, ease of use, decent CC, and less penalty for supports with low boon uptime. None of these benefits are terribly helpful if you've mastered the class and are playing alongside other skilled players, but for training groups it really shines.
---
In reality, the DPS loss really isn't significant unless you're going for *very* high spees clears, but a lot of raiders are tightasses about DPS so you'll probably want to stick to training runs or find a more laid back static to run Reaper. Just be sure to spec a condi DPS build too, Necro or otherwise, since there's some encounters where Reaper really, really doesn't work.
---

And vertical at that. Its going so far that the industry starts to support this bad habit. It spreads faster than mice in a cat and trap free environment. *shudder*
---
Reaper and scourge are both trash, but you can outdps the trash pugs weavers anyways if you're good
---
This is the attitude i like to hear from the community. Play what you like and get good at it :) im totally okay with playing scourge on cobdi fights but any fight i can bash some skulls in with a scythe i will!
---
You know what game allows you to do all of those things? Guild Wars 1. It's a shame GW2 isn't an actual sequel to the first game
---
They were up in the 1k+ range a couple of years ago and then they returned to the vendor/bl chest (cant remember which) and they went down to a couple of  hundred gold. So its nothing strange.
---
Calling it now. This is leading up to the next written story segment for the web.
---
Engineer is in there. Just formatted wrong. It'd dmg and healing/support. Medkit builds off metabattle for group support. 
---
On scrapper, you drop Bulwark gyro on engage and heal with medkit. Use hammer 5 on bomb for cc. Use your reflect bubble when your group backs up or is on the move. Use stealth gyro to hide commander from snipers. 
---
Ah yes the great intelligence rebuttal, tell me more.
---
Actually, outer walls and gates being down is quite common. SM is pretty much constantly trabbed from either red keep or Wildcreek, or often both, so repairing is a waste of supply. 
---
You are correct i am using a meta power build as a building block. I just know the effort that goes into ascended and obviously dont want to waste mats crafting power build if im totally hosed completely. From the replies i see on this post it could be worth it but i suppose ill have to craft 2 sets (power/condi). I appreciate the positivity 👍
---
True story right here. I see a lot of people coming in and wondering why their FPS is less than half of normal lol
---
Really the only way to grind down a T3 stonemist with full supply.
---
Sure, but the entire third of the outer walls? That’s a lot of walls. 
---
Gotcha, yeah I've just never come across a Tower where the staircase wall was blown apart, and I was wondering if it's because most zergs are aware of that potential issue or if it simply wasn't possible to begin with. Thank you for clearing that up!
---
seems smc is like this most weekends
---
out of curiousity: Why you wanna use taco if it doens't give you any advantage?
---
&gt; In WvW you have two sources of loot:
---
4 if you add the rank-up chests and direct loot from killing enemies and npcs. Btw, wvw is the best place to use most boosters that are lying in your bank, especially the celebration/birthday ones. You'll get more from them here than in pve.
---
nope. that was .. 4 years ago i think, when wvw was far more popular. the tower was hard deffed and our side decided to completly destroy it and shot it down with trebs until it was completly empty with supps and destroyed before we went into the zergfight around the tower
---
This is what i am mostly trying to avoid is playing a completely different class. Im a diehard necro fan and just love everything to with the class. It was my favorite class in GW1 aswell amd the theme is my thing. Im okay with making a scourge to get into raid groups as its same armor and what not. I fo have a berserker tempest aswell but the squishiness of elementalists makes me frown. If i can do scourge and get experience so when i play reaper i wont get frowned upon then ill gladly do that but totally playing another class seems like a downer to me. Maybe im stubborn XD
---
It was an enemy t3 Stonemist so we basically just knocked down all the walls and gates and then did the same on inner.
---
Then we ran around Stonemist as the holders of SMC tried to save it and the other side came in to find fights. Lasted an hour or two until finally we capped it when the enemy zergs got tired of being demolished.
---
I'm already almost done gearing ny firebrand now! I'm stoked
---
Do you want people to play or not? Forcing people to play meta builds on the first weekend they're trying the game mode will just result in them leaving. 
---
Honestly? If you love reaper, just build ascended for it anyway. I always think that the top-tier gear should go to the characters you'll use the most and cherish the most -- it's not a waste of mats if it goes into something you love. That seems to be reaper for you. You can use exotics for other alts, it's fine.
---
Also, it's usually said that the first ascended set is the hardest. After that, when you do more endgame content (plus some world bosses like Tequatl and Triple Trouble's wurm) you'll get ascended drops, which you can use for alts or alternate gear.  
---
I saw SMC nearly completely destroyed. Our commander was really good, and we kept wiping the attackers, and using a bit of supply to repair the inner gate a little. We held it like that for quite a while.
---
&gt; ay have 1000 hours in gws but the locals have 1000 hours in WvW. Act accordingly.
---
This is a very good point. Listen to us WvW players while in there! We generally want to help our team be the best it can be, and that means working with everyone. And if you find you like WvW after getting the mount, join up with a guild and have some fun!

Ok, so if you are a PvE player getting this mount you are going to get absolutely fucked up unless you are working with people on your team. Find your groups, work with them, receive loot. Otherwise, people like me will be farming you for bags :D
---
Nah, Couple catas on the corner spots will take down two walls at a time. Plus WvWers can get pretty grindy when we want. I know folks who grab a sup treb and take down SMC walls for fun.
---
Have fun Zerging around \^\^
---
Did jahai on Eu a week after new map came out. Was almost always full and had people for most events. (Time was around midnight btw)
---
I'm a super casual WvW person, so I feel like new players might get some useful insights from my perspective because I am not so invested that I know what is Right and Wrong to do, just what I enjoy.
---
My biggest piece of advice for getting into WvW is to play it on a class you're comfortable on. Take a class that you have learned the ins and outs on. I say this for two reasons: 1. WvW uses PvE gear stats, so a new character will vaporize the first time a guard looks at you. 2. You will be more familiar with weapon skills, utilities, and traits that you can change to make yourself more effective.
---
Find the thing that you like doing. If you're starting off, you will probably end up following groups of other people around taking objectives. But realize that this is just one way to play the mode. Do you want to roam alone or go with the zerg? If you roam, do you want to just take territory or also kill other roamers? If you zerg, do you want to be on the front lines or the back lines? Doing damage or healing? The role you play will probably be dictated by your PvE playstyle.
---
You will likely need a gear change, so learn the new stat types you'll need. It's fairly easy once you get a hang of it. Berserker's changes to Marauder's, Viper's changes to Dire or Trailblazers, Magi's/Diviner's/Harrier's tends to change to Minstrel's. Some of these can be expensive, others can be dirt cheap. Just be aware that your gear will usually be (Stat you use in PvE + Vitality and/or Toughness) and you can cobble together the gear you need or gear you can use in the interim fairly fast (for example, for power builds, you can always just grab Soldier's gear from Orr.
---
Objectives will vary depending on how you're playing, but in general you'd going to want to take territory and kill enemy players. Territory is guarded by guard NPCs, but sometimes other players will come to help if they're observant. If you're solo, camps are going to be your targets. If you're in a small group or 3-5 people, Towers are also realistic. If you're in a larger group, you can probably take on Keeps. For camps, you can stroll in an kill the guards. I would put this as one of the first things to practice on. Get comfortable solo-ing a camp so your build can do substantial damage and you know how to sustain yourself and not have to blow all your cooldowns. The guards have various forms of hard and soft CC, so a stunbreaker is usually required (and I always have one just because it makes it more comfortable). For larger targets like Towers/Keeps, you will need siege engines. When you're at an allied structure (camp, tower, keep) there will be a supply pile. Make sure that you have as much supply as you can hold. As a new player, I would recommend not plopping down siege yourself, but just build siege if a commander puts a construction site down.
---
There's more to get into, but I think this covers the basics. Keep in mind that some of this stuff with siege might change with the update depending on what the mount is like, but the rest is general advice. If you want, look at builds online like Metabattle's and see what piques your interest.
---
1: while i agree that travel time sucks, it's also very much directly connected to tactics. if you're too close to their spawn, it's probably not gonna be worth going for many of their close keeps since they can very quickly trickle back.
---
Tell us how you really feel.
---
omg I can't wait for the free bags 
---
Ah, that. Well, don't like it, don't look at it. Some people really need to grow up.
---
Anyway, I'd appreciate watching more of your art anyway, so feel free to PM me. If it's too kinky then I'll just close the tab and move along ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯.
---
i was once defending garrison against both Mag AND SBI (yes, they were cooperating), and literally every breakable piece was broken. this included doors, walls, and static siege placements.

In all seriousness though, the only viking-esque gear that comes to mind available to all races is the Koda set from HOTW
---
People play games to have fun, if running bearbow is what it takes then you should respect that and work within those confines. 
---
Giving constructive feedback on making changes to utility slots and traits is an accessible option anyone can take. Ridiculing them in a 40 people discord call and bullying them into logging off will only further drive players away. 
---
You know why I turned away from WvW after 2 years of roaming? Because special snowflake commanders go on power trips and force everyone else to conform to zerging builds. "If you're not in a zerg then you're not helping."
---
Also calling your fellow players "dead weight. Yikes.
---
It's not implemented yet.  More information coming with the release on Tuesday.
---

---
Reaper is fine in Fractals.  They can pump out plenty of damage as well as access to CC, boonstripping, and ability to survive.  The main downside is they don’t have much to share with the party on a damage focused power build.
---

In the end, I downloaded the overlay thing and did some sightseeing while I followed the dotted line and got about 200 an hour, which is considerably better than bounties and took me some interesting places. 
---
The one's I always remember is Quentin Lake on EB. That has a ground to tower lord ramp. It's stair wall is destroyed regularly.
---
The other one I can think of now is NWT on the Alpine Borderlands. The stairwall there is the popular place to breach as the gate is backed up to enemy spawn.
---

Yeah except boon soulbeasts and druids are great 1v1 and roamers. Such a shame not every class is balanced for pressing 1 on doors.
---
I just use ArcDPS instead of the golem
---
With the caveat that often times WvW meta is stale because of bandwagoning. For instance, I know people who ran power scourge well before everyone jumped onto it. They’d get flamed. And now power scourge is basically mandatory.
---
There are a lot of headscratchers that someone from the outside looking in who isn’t so wrapped up in the WvW shit will be like “why aren’t people using this”.
---
This is one of the reasons I love roaming in WvW more than anything else. I'm raiding in a zerge I will switch over to a meta build, but when I'm just roaming I have the complete freedom to do WHATEVER I WANT, regardless of how stupid/ineffective it may be. 
---
Often if I have some downtime at work I'll theorycraft something on http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/ and give it a shot when I get home. 
---
Recently I've been playing around with Sword/Dagger spellbreaker builds. Entirely lacking in survivability but balls to the wall damage. Get face rolled a lot, but incredibly satisfying when you catch someone with a 14k crit they did not expect from a warrior. On the other side of the spectrum I've also been playing with a healing power supported mending build. 
---
Point being, you have 4k hours into the game, take the time to create the build that's fun for you instead of looking for an existing one.
---
Patience will answer that question.
---
The problem was never "will it be usable in PvE?". 
---
It was always "why the heck did the new piece of content get added to WvW when they've yet to really bother fixing it?"
---
Wait, there's an offline version?! I thought they stopped anyone from doing that
---
I think scourge is power now if that’s why you wanted it
---
Expectation leads to suffering.
---
But the meme potential is too good.
---
I'd disagree, but everyone has something different they like about WvW, which is great. I hate roaming, but it's all some people play. I used to play ZergBusting but now that it's dead I just like popping huge numbers in the enemy zerg. I like big stressful fights... live for the shit.
---
I guess what I'm trying to say is there's a lot of depth to WvW. Just try everything and see what you like. And your server probably has multiple coms, find the ones you like following each will be vastly different.
---
But it's not like you *have* to like the game mode. 
---
I was talking about zerging. Who gives a shit what you play in roaming?
---
@OP - Please beware of *availability bias*.
---
The vocal whiners, shitters, and wizards that think they can see the future are a minority in the community.  Far, far more players welcome changes, refrain from complaining about content they haven't experienced, and are otherwise relatively silent - as evidenced by the number of active users on the subreddit compared the number of posts.  Appealing to this minority won't sway them to your position, and will only serve as fodder for their favorite hobby: speculative griefing.
---
Sit back and enjoy insightful comments and healthy speculation, and let the know-it-alls demonstrate how much they don't.  Every major overhaul and content release is like this, so don't let it get to you.
---
1. I think berserker favours condition damage over power. Maybe stock up on some condi gear? 
---
2. What is your gear like? At 80, you want exotics at least, matching your damage type (power, precision, ferocity OR condition damage with expertise are what to look for). The expansions are definitely harder than the core game, though. 
---
3. Ascended gear *is* more powerful and allows you to progress up the tiers in fractals. New gear would mean different stat combinations, and having the right stats is ultimately more important than having ascended gear at this point. Make sure you get a set of six matching runes, too, as a set of six is always more powerful than six different ones. 
---
4. Sell Unidentified Gear on the trading post - not to vendors. You usually get more than if you salvage it, especially for green and yellow UnID gear. People can boost magic find up really, really high buy UnID gear in bulk to try to farm ultra rare gear so there's a good market for it. 
---
5. Istan is a map in the Living World story content. It has a meta event that lends itself well to zerging and drops a lot of unidentified gear, volatile magic (a currency) and various odds and sods. It's farmed a lot because it's fairly straightforward and low-pressure with decent returns. 
---
Wait, what? How is "We bleed fire" just guaranteed damage? Just bring a bunch of reflects and its just a DPS increase for you.
---
Again, commanders yelling across map chat telling roamers to either log off or join the zerg :)
---
[Good old EU T9 during the night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5U83iNJ-l4) (video by a guildmate of mine, wasn't there when they did that, IIRC it was around 3 AM, and it was possibile no one was playing).
---
That was 5 years ago btw. 
---
Seen keeps with all but one wall destroyed. SMC with holes everywhere. 
---
These tend to be from prolonged attacks or one side just using it as a kill farm. 
---
&gt;most builds can’t reflect that often. 
---
Most classes have a reflect utility, and some can use them a hell of a lot. It's a good thing you have 5 players in a fractal- getting 100% reflect uptime comfortably is not hard. Utility skills are swappable for a reason, and the vast majority of builds are not so dependent on every single slot for DPS that they can't afford bringing in a reflect.
---
Paragon Chat lol yes! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WV52ncCN8uY its been up since idk, 3-4 years now :) there just isnt any combat as far as im aware because that would require a server and its not allowed
---
Where did I reacted emotionally? It is true that PvEler whine a lot, cause content is "too hard", see fractals right now.
---
Why would they need to roam till 1000? Mounts wont be that fast, that you never will catch up to them. Even if they are faster than the average speed + Buff, till they bring down the walls you will catch up.
---
You really think a mount will bring people to WvW and let them stay? xD Grow up. If they need a too high rank, they will quit and whine about it like they did with the legendary armor/backpack, if they can get it fast, they will leave after they get it. If you read some of the threads you would know, that a lot of people will join just for the mount.
---
If some of them stay, because some of them "will finally catch up to the zerg" fine. But why make an WvW mount, which is probably useless in PvE, easy to get, so some PvElers can get them, instead of people who really want to play that mode work for it?
---
We bleed fire is so easy to deal with. Just bring reflects. You have 5 characters and multiple utility slots. Very easy to remove most of it.
---
If you have a group that does it, and you enjoy it, raids are a great source of gold.  In addition to this, I open 30 fractal boxes every day, it's a gamble but I only come up short probably 25% of the time, and when I do it's never more than 1 gold.  Most days I get roughly 1-2G from opening them.  1-2G from fractal boxes, 2G from dailies, and if you can squeeze in a tequatl fight every day that's an easy 6G right there.  Depending on how much you can clear per week, you can get a good chunk of gold from raids (I can't recall the amounts off the top of my head).  
---
Besides that, if you can hit some of the rich gathering nodes on a couple characters every day you can get a couple gold easily.  
---
More than anything, just don't spend it on anything, it'll gradually accumulate over time.  
---
thanks!
---
I can outdps random pugs as reaper regularly on power bosses.
---
It depends on your personal ability to play the spec.
---
Only ignorant wannabe elitists would kick you.
---
Everyone might say that reaper is ok here on reddit(and I agree with them), but the real case is that you ll be instantly kicked from most of pug parties in raids or fractals.

Your use of 'everyone' is problematic, as I am one case in point that defeats it.  Looking forward to learning more about the mount, how it will be implemented - used and countered - and all the variety of new plays that will result.  Can't wait to get mine on Tuesday.
---
I wait until they release new content(every 2-3 months). Then I finish everything in like a couple of hours( Unless they add a new raid or fractal that adds like a week time). And then quit for 2-3 months again

---
added! 
---
&gt; And if you find you like WvW after getting the mount, join up with a guild and have some fun!
---
This should really be stressed more in the upcoming week than anything. You have access to be a part of five guilds and most guilds are usually looking for new blood... not to mention have the ability to get you where you need to be f you truly have fun in WvW.
---
If you do join a guild, do not fret if they are not on your server (due to links) as you have till the next re-link (usually every nne weeks) to make up your mind about the decision to move or not. Till that re-link, you will be paired with the guild you joined and their success is your success as well. 
---
Used to play scrapper and roamed with a reaper. I was pretty much her support, gave superspeed/stealth and watched her obliterate everyone
---
Fixxed it.
---
Agreed with many of the posts below:  
---
While Power reaper is not a top benchmark and snowcrows labels it as "mediocre" for DPS, I would talke a Reaper main who knows his class and his mechanics any day over someone who plays a build cause its "meta" but doesnt know it very well.  
---
Realistically, if you stick with your class and get real good, you will out-dps most others in pugs   
---
That is the plan. I really enjoy the class and it will always be my main. Will keep at it! Thanks!
---
Any advice for seone who has a potato laptop? I've tried to get in to WvW but the zergs make the game a slideshow for me and I'm not very helpful. On the other hand, I've tried roaming solo and I just get slaughtered by experienced folks. I feel like I don't contribute at all =-/
---
&gt;every server kind of has it's own way of doing stuff- calls, builds, commanding, way of fighting etc. I like to consider it like a server personality- each community developed slightly differently over the years (ie. fight vs train/blob servers). You'll learn these differences just by getting involved with your squads and coms. Don't be surprised if your world relinks and the host server does stuff a little different though.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;edit: PSA: Most server Discords/TS3 have the builds they're running linked somewhere. Use those over MetaBattles if you can!

What's the point tho? Use 5-10 supply to slow down one player, when all it's gonna take for them to remount is to get out of combat after a couple of seconds?

---
Here's a few tips that I posted on my tumblr already, some of these are more discreet/overlooked in big guides I believe. You can view it as unspoken wvw rules or etiquette.
---
**Before you join a group, grab supplies somewhere.** Always carry max supply possible if you’re with a commander. Don’t take supplies if the objective shows something like 600/1200 supply or less, it likely means the objective is/was under attack recently, supplies are needed for emergency repair/defense siege.
---
**Can you even follow THAT tag?** Unlike pve, wvw tags use a color code to determine open/closed status. May differ from server to server, my folks tend to have blue, green, white and pink as open, public tags, while another color could mean a closed guild raid. Ask the commander politely if it’s okay to follow, and if not, please respect that.
---
**Lower/south part of alpine borders is considered a duel/gvg zone.** Unofficially, still widely recognized. Often you’ll see opponents /bow to each other before engaging, and not finishing/cleaving downed people to death: they just have fun dueling. Jumping into a 1v1 to “help” could always turn out as ruining someone’s fair fight. :P You could never tell if that’s the case unless you ask though.
---
GvG is a neverending zerg v zerg basically, joining them as non-guildie could be a bad tone too. If you see multiple guilds here, they might be doing an organized server v server, then you may join, just ask, join voice and be on a zerg class (see metabattle)
---
**If you’re alone capping something and you notice an ally running to you at full speed, please leave the circle asap and wait for the person.** Sharing is caring. Not making it 0.2 seconds before something is capped right under your nose is soooo frustrating, right? Be nice and the favor will return.

**Don’t use siege if you don’t have the mastery and if there are other people around.** Mastery gives a significant damage buff, cooldown reduction and new important skills. Say in white chat “I have no mastery, someone take over”. However if no one else’s willing to use it, feel free to.
---
Last but not least, and an obvious one: communicating, being honest, polite, listening and willing to learn will take you places. Don’t be afraid to say you’re new and ask questions. The mode is more welcoming than one may think if you come off as intelligent and genuinely interested in being helpful.

&gt; Waiting for a PUG for fractals isn't fun. Let's just expand fractals to squad-size so you have a better chance of 'jumping in' right away.
---
lul...
---
That would have the exact opposite effect, increase the LFG times.
---
&gt; Changing a core mechanic because a handful don't find it 'fun' isn't a good reason to change that mechanic.
---
First off, I seriously doubt only a "handful" have an issue with the long running. VERY seriously.
---
Second, the mechanic isn't going anywhere. It's just becoming a bit more dynamic and a bit less boring.
---
Nah I'm not an attention whore like you, sorry :) I don't need to act like an obnoxious brat in front of randoms on the internet. I grew up. Nice low effort bait though.
---
I waited for close to 2 hours a couple of times.  Problem is the map closes.
---
Yeah, took at least a year for people to realize they're writing to all maps now.
---
Most other classed 1v1 better than Ranger?
---
Wut? Ranger is thr best 1vX right now.
---
https://gw2efficiency.com this site can help with alot of things like craft vs buy etc and has step by step instructions as well for any item you want. Crafting harriers is harder than switching a cheaper ascended gear so i would go for the mystic forge route.
---
Also note that the site has an ascended value section showing which one is easier to craft and more profitable to swap.
---
F2p can't trade, it's to keep scammers/boots out
---
Interesting. I dont plan on looking or joining speed clears. I love power reaper it is a ton of fun and i really wanna tske it to endgame content. Thank you for the information!
---
It is very often cheaper to make an ascended set in something else and stat swap it using the mystic forge. Harriers is, unfortunately, one of the more grindy stats if you don't spend a lot of time in the PoF maps, so I really would go for the stat swap thing. 
---
Grandmaster marks are another way of saving money if you have the appropriate second currency (fractal, raid, PvP etc). 
---
Make your time-gated stuff every time you log in. It only takes a minute and it'll begin to pile up nice and quickly. 
---
Your first ascended set is the hardest, always. After than it'll seem less daunting. Don't worry - we all pretty much had the same reaction. 
---
Oh - chest &gt;  head &gt;  legs &gt; everything else is the order you should make them in for the maximum benefit because of how the stats are distributed. 
---
Well, not exactly what I was looking for (objectives with all breakable parts totally destroyed by conventional means) but that is definitely interesting. 
---
I love Braham's Armor...I use it because it's one of the few ways to get plenty of leather and fur in an outfit for Heavy characters. My female Norn Dragon Hunter and my male Human Herald both use several pieces from this set! I believe my female Spellbreaker Asura also uses the gauntlets for the animal head motif (it seems they were going for bears, but they also work as cats/female lions, and she has a huge lion motif so it fits neatly)
---
She (Norn DH) uses the chest and pants while he (Human Herald) uses the chest and boots. The gender differences in the chest make it look completely different between character sex.
---
My goal is definitely to perfect this class to the best of my abilities and then higher than that. I plan to gear scourge up right after i finish my ascended power reaper. Any suggestions on what ascended gear to make for a scourge? 
---
Human cultural T1 helmet is actually pretty Viking in style. Add in any chainmail torso and you're mostly there.
---
Something about Dragon's stand gets me every single time. 
---
Love that event 
---
oh apologies! Im not knowledgable on all classes so I did ask my guild for pointers, but sure I will add your post to the thread too! idk I guess it varies from server to server who knows lol we dont all have the same experiences
---
I think we'll see quite a bit of adaptation and adoption of the mount.  I think we'll see people having fun checking them out.    It will be interesting to see how it is used, where it is used and why.   Looking forward to Tuesday. As for 'more will leave than stay', time will tell.  My bet is on people staying, mounts incorporated into plays in WvW, some adjustments needed,  world continues to turn. 
---
I'd add also that if you suffer from frame-rates drops during fights between groups (blobs) you should consider tweaking your graphic settings to the minimum - even disable enemy rendering upon close proximity (General Options &gt; Competetive &amp; Graphics Options &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Character Model Limit &amp;).
---
Name plates can be affecting performance on older and weaker machines as well so you can try disabling these - you can always toggle them up for a sec with left alt button (General Options &gt; User Interface &amp; Competetive; same feature and keybind is present in GW1). The other option will replace enemy names with symbols over their heads. 
---
Oh I just updated the post, was getting back from work, Im not an expert on engineers but I asked my guild - basically not much but you can still run a healer build or some dps (scrapper and holo respectively), your best bet is to go on metabattle and browse youtube for awhile till you find something, its a good starting point if you dont know what to do and don't have a wvw guild. Metabattle aint great, but yeah, good starting point and I hope others give some advice on engineers too as you are the 3rd person asking! (for farming next week though do consider a scourge with Aoes, its great for farming and tagging!)
---
Oh yesss, good one! I always played like this it never even crossed my mind that people have field of view close up to their character! 
---
would you just stop
---
That's another thing they need to fix. People should not have to look at timers and number of stacks in the effects monitor to know how much condition damage they are going to take, that should be painted in the health orb, by coloring a portion of the orb based on how much damage they are going to take from the conditions they have on, if they are allowed to last their full duration. 
---
So if you have 20K HP and you got 5K damage worth of bleeding on you, your HP orb would get a 5K high colored band covering part of your health, indicating the upcoming damage. 
---
If the future damage were to go past your health, then the extra damage would be added at the bottom like barrier is added at the top. So in the previous example, if you got 25K damage in your 20K HP orb, you'd see all of your 20K colored for future damage, plus an extra darker band of -5K HP added at the bottom.
---
Oh... right!  Thanks!
---
If keep is T3 and your server has nothing going on an you just want partictipation you can just plop a cata down at double walls and turn on autohotkey clicker. Every point of dmg refreshes participation.
---
If you refuse to take a build or class that's useful to the squad, but still bitch and whine for a spot in the squad, you're the toxic one, not the commander for saying "no."
---
You'll need thicker skin than that for any pvp format.
---
If you don't want to take a useful build, then just accept that, while you can still follow the tag, you won't get into the squad.  So don't waste everyone else's time making a scene about it.  Everyone else just wants to play while still being useful, and don't want to waste that time dealing with useless crybaby snowflakes.
---
but anet allows multiboxing, so it's anet's way
---
Thanks for the info. I was wandering after looking at it what is the best way to farm blade shards? I need alot of em and feel like this will be the heavy part of the journey.
---
Yeah. I play backline Rev. :)
---
I see the point you are trying to make but I argue that you are not seeing the forest through the trees.
---
* Fighters - Increases our KD ratio, adds points to our score, and keeps the enemy busy and off our objectives so that roamers can safely escort yaks, build up siege, etc.  Definitely greatly increases team success overall.
---
* Roamers - Take out camps, lay down traps, kill yaks, escort yaks, get shrines for the buff, and very importantly killing other roamers who would kill our yaks and take our camps.  Contributes to team success.
---
* Karma Farms - Takes objectives, clears out upgraded enemy keeps, distracts enemy from being able to focus on our important objectives, even if those objectives are turned over.  Basically Karma training always happens as a product of boredom and a way to keep busy, but it still contributes to team success.
---
* Duelers - Not too much different to Roamers, they usually do the same things.  The ones that stand around literally just waiting for duels honetly are in the wrong place (PvP is more suited so 1v1 duels and PvP is regulated better for that, but we are used to ignoring them.  They can still contribute in their way sometimes.  I only have a problem with duelers when they A) *Complain* about their duels being interrupted because as I said, this playground wasn't made with them in mind and B) Hang out on Queued maps to duel when there is literally no need to.  They should be on the least busy maps if they insist.  They *can* help with team success but this depends on the player, but duelers are such a small group that honestly they are inconsequential.
---
So you were saying that people like to do things that don't actually contribute to team success, but I think I've made  it pretty clear all the ways in which the different activities people prefer still contribute to team success.  As I said, it's not about pressuring people to all be doing the same activities. Team success is still the underlying goal of the day, it is still always the end result, and while some people don't care if they win there are a majority of people who do, and no matter  how to cut the pie, we're all doing our part some way. 
---
Link is dead for me
---
I understand. After i took a nap, i immediately understood i was biting way moire than i could chew. hehe.
---
I dont think the GM means autorunning is forbidden. just that it may look like 3rd party when they investigate. 
---
Like this video i sent to someone beacuse they said i ran all accs simultaneously. It may look identical when its not https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0l_1VR7RzA
---
Will do. Thank you, friend.
---
A lot of people get "falsely" banned for it despite it being allowed. Weird.
---
This is such a stupid discussion. You wanna let people into your PvE raid group too on their rifle warriors? They might be better than your elementalist, who knows.
---
If someone brings a literal PvE build into WvW they can be as good as they want, they will die. They will not contribute. Why? Because WvW balance is fucking botched to the point where only a handfull builds are playable in a zerg fight. That's not on the commander, not on the people playing off meta builds, not on the people playing meta builds.
---
It's on Anet for not balancing their fucking game. 
---
So you gotta deal with that unbalanced scenario. By playing the builds that aren't fucking useless. Why is that so hard to understand?
---
Especially in a zerg fight where, if you die you could bring up to 5 enemies back to life, because they rally off of you.
---
Oh no, they accidentally banned someone violating the Rules of Conduct in game. The horror
---
Got them all when they were like 50-70 gold. I feel good!
---
Idk if this is a super noob question but are W3 and W2 etc raid wings?? And the following phrases after are the different bosses? Just making sure. Also what is LI? I have never stepped into raiding in gw2 before. Just want to get my info and then research the crap out of everything. I feel like thats good advice with the kind interections, I am usually that anyway so should be good there. Really just looking to have fun and meet some cool people, expand my knowledge on the endgame content and possibly bring my guild into it and get a static group going. If i knew how to do the raids id be doing training groups as much as I could or just let whoever in for the most part and teach people. 
---
It seems that gods will be making a comeback.
---
added your stuff to the main thread :D happy it helped even for a veteran!
---
Asking people to think is not being hateful.
---
Don't play core ranger
---

Thanks for pointing it out, reposted a working link and deleted this one.
---
You're not reading what I said. I said yes, mesmer would be the better option still, but unless your min maxing to save seconds off your clear time, pugs are not going to care if you brought one of three options of a quickness/alacrity boon bot. 
---
Just to add onto this...
---
If you are a good duelist in PvP, you will do quite well in small-group combat. I've 2v1'ed and 3v1'ed on my holo in WvW before -- many WvW players don't know how to handle a good duelist. 
---
Love this thank you, I'm adding it to the main thread :D can't hurthaving more info on scouting! 
---
Even in Spanish is like that, so yeah, SMC is "The perfect one".
---
It isn't. Your phone is only vertical if you hold it that way. The "convenience" really is only lazyness to turn the phone sideways to view imagery or videos, and it spreads like cancer into areas where vertical orientation really shouldn't exist.
---
This is a great writeup and I’m is very helpful for players new to the wvw game mode. Whenever I try something new I always appreciate being able to find writeups to help me wrap my head around whatever it is I’m planning on doing. 
---
One gripe tho.. Loose is like a pair of jeans or a wizards sleeve. Lose is the opposite of win or gain. 
---
Sorry. Just a few clarification points. What is GS? And what do you mean that it differs on if I sell them or not?
---
I’m also not familiar with the charms that drop out of salvage. Not sure I’ve seen any. Are they a material component for making sigils?
---
Regarding the actual combat, I feel like I’m dodging big attacks fairly well but fights are noticeably very hectic in POF so far. Lots of incoming stuff and feel like I can’t heal fast enough. It’s a strange feeling as I was really good PvP/dungeon crawler back in the day. CoE was my favorite and Subject Alpha was an asshole back then. 
---
Thanks so much. You’ve been tremendously helpful. 
---
My guild did a mass 32-Slot Collection Completion Run over the weekend, and we were only about 1/3 of the people there for the metas. Still seems surprisingly populated. 
---
Looks sick, what pieces are those?
---
Thanks a lot, this looks dope! 
---
**Ding!**
---
Though on the serious side, while a MobileSins channel probably wouldn't florish due to the short timed nature of mobile videos and images, it would be a very welcome appearance for me.
---
I still miss them. Although pve players getting fruits of wvw players' efforts could feel strange, personally I, as a non-wvw'er back then, noticed these bonuses, got curious about wvw and thought it's actually a kinda neat incentive.
---
Now we have gemstore glyphs that give you that extra gathering strike.
---
Thank you, I hope to recreate a historically accurate viking, I'm a pretty big fan of that whole time period 😁
---
I want this so much.
---
I didn't see this in there, but wanted to add:
---
Eat good foods! When in doubt what food you should take, try the [oyster dish](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Food#Damage_Reduction) corresponding to your primary stat.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Thanks for the input 😁
---
Idk about the 'great writeup' personally since that article didn't give much info really... all we have to do is just wait till Tuesday
---
Thanks, I'll make sure to check those out
---
I came here to post this, how is this the top post! Amazing. I love Reddit.
---
The WvW Wiki page has a guide on common terms and abbreviation, scouting terminology, and a role overview. They're very helpful.
---
* [Role Guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_versus_World#Roles) (Scouting/Zerging/Roaming)
---
* [Terms and Abbreviations](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_versus_World#Common_Terms_and_Abbreviations)
---
Thank you! I forgot to mention that, it's heavy armor 👍
---
I meant to reply to the guy at the top. O well. Yeah idk about the website. My bad.
---
Oh yess,, foods! love food! i even keep forgetting and many other seasoned players
---
which was also mentioned immediately on the mmorpg article
---
Sadly it isn't. If the reddit app works like, say, WhatsApp, they can hotlaunch the camera from it and really just need to take the photo, it'll instantly get uploaded then. Even if they did it manually, it would just be about the same amount of work.
---
And i dont get it. They are playing GW2 on a PC, therefore are connected to the internet, but decide to use their mobile device to take a literal photo and upload it instead of using the screenshot functionality of the game, or Snipping Tool, or printscreen button to paste into Paint...
---
Its probably just a sign of getting old, and i'm not even 30 yet.
---
This is a great writeup and I’m sure is very helpful for players new to the wvw game mode. Whenever I try something new I always appreciate being able to find writeups to help me wrap my head around whatever it is I’m planning on doing. 
---
There will probably be a sale next Tuesday anyway
---
I run a slightly different/more traditional version of this.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Soulbeast_-_Dual_Axe_Roamer
---
I run the 6 marauder armor pieces but keep trinkets the same as said in the guide, i also run double cleanse sigils over hydromancy and intelligence and always take quickening zephyr as third utilitt as that+AA spam is your damage. I use the 5% dmg reduction when you have regen trait.
---
[Here](https://youtu.be/7FjBgQML610) is Donee using yet another slightly different variation of the build as a showcase. Would not advice this weapon set.
---
But the whole reddit app is a vertically scrolling experience, even on desktop. I can’t hold my phone horizontally in one hand. 
---
I wish there was an axe skin that looked simple and sleek, with a relatively small head like the [**Leviathan Axe**](https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cHV74qmsWOlCTjC6UzbSID1L7ME=/0x0:1920x1080/1200x800/filters:focal(623x309:929x615)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59511973/07.0.png).
---
Locked for Russia, with VPN (US server) its available.
---
Haven't played WvW for months. Is it still the same firebrand + scourge + bubble? I got really tired of that and wish they could rework sand savant and nerf some firebrand support. 
---
Hopefully the mount can bring in some new strategy and shake the meta.
---
Your account even gets flagged when you get falsely banned, which can cause false bans again. So it is not that unusual that ppl who have been banned once by mistake, get banned again.
---
T~T &lt;3
---
Yep, garbage game that doesn't deserve your attention.
---
It had great potential, seriously easily the best MMO combat the industry has to offer, but all the competent balance devs left years ago and the current ones have been shoveling piles of shit on for so long it that almost nothing remains of it. And of course there's like 1 guy working on PvP and even he's busy working on systems rather than content.
---
I remember farming my Royal Guard title one Sunday afternoon, thanks to a T3 Stonemist that had every single outer wall knocked down. Stick some arrow carts on the top floor above the gates, sit back and enjoy...
---
By the way, I think the rarest sight in WvW would be a T3 Anza. Less rare since the introduction of automatic upgrades, but still, not something you see often unless there's been no action for hours on end.
---
Dungeons do need some love and attention from anet (which they will unfortunately never get), but I don't think that confusing or misleading mechanics are one of their problems. I've never heard of anyone having trouble figuring out how to solve a puzzle or kill a boss. If you run into a major bug, all bets are off, but I have rarely seen a bug in a dungeons that couldn't be solved by a good wipe. 
---
I have heard of plenty of new players struggling with difficulty in dungeons, not because they are objectively hard, but because they are much harder than open world content up to that point, and because they reward players who gear exclusively for damage, which new players simply cannot do at that point.
---
Guess again. I'm the one who approved it and ignored the reports.
---
Necro axe auto attack 5% damage boost.
---
It's the only buff that matters.
---
Ignore the compliment, focus on the criticism. Just tryna help you out. I guess you could say I loose this round. 
---
I kind of wonder what restrictions will be on mounting.
---
Gliding is only in areas your side controls; they could limit initial mounts similarly but let you stay mounted in enemy controlled areas.
---
If they limit initial mounting to your own citadel, they could even add a mount rental NPC like the races.
---
That would avoid imbalance issues with pof vs core/hot players, and help limit the effectiveness of mount zergs.
---
IDK, I'm reading a bunch of other things on the list representing to be what "we" want.  So, actually not so simple afterall.
---
To say PvE needs no balance is to completely overlook how some classes provide next to nothing. Scrapper is currently unplayable in any end game PvE mode. Necro is playable, but by no means desirable apart from w5b1 and troll runs where players are expected to go downstate. Warrior literally has to give up 2 utility slots in every end game PvE mode, and there is near zero reason to bring a second warrior. The list can go on. Sure, if you only look at open world, everything works and the game is full of rainbows, but if you look from fractals T4/CM and raids, PvE can use a lot of tweaks. 
---
And because content is balanced around those buffs in particular is why they need to change. Running without quickness/alacrity is gimping your team, and putting most teams into a state where they cant beat the content solely for those reasons--luckily, chrono doesnt have a monopoly on those buffs, but it remains the only class that can provide both. Banners/spirits are currently super strong group-wide DPS boosts and are class specific, without any comparison, let alone equal. (And I know to the latter some people think other classes get buffs like vamp/Rev aura, but those are nowhere near the level of banners/spirits, plus dont factor in that the classes that bring banner/spirit also bring emp allies and spotter.)
---
https://gw2style.com/look.php?id=13443
---
&gt;With pack runes you provide fury.
---
My point was based on the class alone. Using the runes is fair, but there's a fair amount of other classes that can provide boons without any certain gear required.
---
&gt;Swiftness isn't too hard to get, focus 4 could give it
---
Fair point, but usually you want the incredibly fun pull over the swiftness.
---
&gt;Chrono can still share Aegis as well.
---
I wasn't including Aegis in my comment of "common boons" since it's used usually for specific things.
---
&gt;plus being able to extend boons fits the theme of time fuckery
---
But that isn't a chrono thing, that's a base Mesmer thing, who's theme is illusion and trickery
---
Yet you see the downvotes on the person you reply to. People still don't see that anyone being banned for auto-running on multiple accs is just wrong.
---
Anet as a company do more false-bans than any other game company i've witnessed personally. And their policy of ignoring you with "final" replies is not helping either. 
---
There is a very big issue of either lack of tools to check things (i mean it is freakin auto-run!) or lack of training on their GMs or both. It shows for years now and i am not sure why people are okay with it till it hurts them. Oh because these things do hurt the casual normal average players too.
---
Every thread about taco is massively upvoted for example
---
There was a Sea guild recruit begining of jan on lfg. So they do Exist. Worst case create your own &gt; post on lfg and /r/guildrecruitment then you can set your own times*.
---
*disclaimer, This does take some work.
---
Also most responses happen in private. not in the comments. Just like on /r/GW2Exchange 
---
Ignore all the complainers about pvp and try it yourself.  I personally really enjoy it, and i generally don't like most pvp games.  Is their inbalance issues?  Sure there is, just like every other pvp game, but i still find it fun and rewarding.
---
I had always planned on playing WvW when I got round to it, and I thought that this patch would be an excellent time to start. But if this is what the WvW community is like, then why bother? Now I think I'll just do it for the mount and leave, and only if the mount seems worth it. 
---
Yeah because we care so much about if the PvE players get bonus from our work in WvW through out the week so we will for sure rig stuff for them....
---
Welcome to WvW. Play Firebrand, Scourge or GTFO.
---
Sincerely
---
Anet
---
how did you multibox without a thrird party programm???   
---
and why would you stop playing, when they even reacted to you and reverted the suspension? What can you expect more than this? 
---
A 100% "proper" system for detection doesnt exist. And sice they allow some sort of third party programs right now its nearly imossible for a detection program to do this. The same will happen to you in every online game where the developers actually care.
---
I approve! Doesnt hurt to try
---
Map Chat Tip:  Every server has **one** person who solely exists in map chat, complaining and bitching about the same things every day. Figure out who your servers map troll is and just put them on ignore. Then map chat will mostly be callouts or where people are. 
---
pug had these options for  2 months,90% of pugs still looking for chrono,bcs normal t4 pug doesnt give a fck about patch notes,hell ppl still looking for druid,even tho FB HEALER is 2x better. question is,if ppl are just lazy or they just doesnt care,when sub optimal party still working. only where you gona see FEW ppl trying to play this new meta is in CMs,but as i said,its rare,even if its better,its not THAT MUCH BETTER.
---
No problem, and thanks for the initiative! I only started writing up my own tips after I saw others doing it. First bumped into a tumblr post, then checked reddit and found yours. It's amazing how many people are joining the discussion and seeing both vets and newbs being positive and chatting makes me feel better about wvw's future.
---
Ha, I had actually considered doing that...how long did it take you to get enough kp to pug with? I went EU to play with my friends, so I'd prefer a shorter "vacation" to NA servers if I go that route
---
Right!? I'm sooo tempted to post this entire thing over to WvW forums but I actually don't lurk there that much so I'm afraid it will just get shat on... I may give it a shot though, what do you think? Do forums even have the same format as reddit does?
---
Meanwhile, due to the limited space of the maps, people who *are* running metabuilds and who will actually contribute to the team are stuck in queue because someone who's only there to be selfish is taking up a spot. It's understandable for a commander to want to maximize his team's effectiveness by making sure those spots go to someone who's helping as much as possible.
---
I understand the desire to play whatever you want, and I think most of the time that's fine, but it's not fair to expect the WvW natives to bend over backwards to accomodate you if you can't even be bothered to put forth a little bit of effort to fit in and do your part.
---
If you're just constantly dying because your build/gear isn't suited for the mode, are you really going to be having fun? I would rather play something a little different than what I might normally prefer and contribute to the team's success (thereby winning more, surviving more, and getting more rewards)  than just play something I usually like better but spend more time losing and dead.
---
I hope so too! I did some lurking and managed to pull some stuff from old reddit threads hehe
---
Yeah but they're usually pretty non-climactic though, right? Just skill nerfs/buffs? 
---
The reddit community for the most part, either doesn't care about Pvp or hates it with all their hearts. So I would download the f2p version, and look up some core ( non elite specialization builds) guardian/ thief / warrior build if you don't own any of the expansions and try it for yourself.
---
If you own them check godsofpvp website or metabattle.
---
I don’t think this will be about the main story, especially after Kormir made all that fuss about leaving and leaving us to clean up thier mess.
---
Fuck you Gods.
---
Hammer and Glint is your default. It allows you to (1) actually be a backline and (2) to buff your fellow backliners.
---
The other legend depends on when they're useful. Shiro has great burst and mobility, and Mallyx has mostly condi management. 
---
Staff is mostly a utility weapon, and as such should be used when you actually need it. A block, a condi cleanse, cc and a powerful dash are all useful tools, but they do stop you from being a backline damage dealer for the next 10 seconds. Use it when the enemy managed to close in, and try to get in a position where you can start hammering again.

1.) server lag does t just happen at massive three ways, it happens far more often than it should. “Shrug and let the players handle the issue” you’ve just admitted that this is a major issue and isn’t solved. It isn’t nitpicking, and even if we take your point at its best, where this stuff only occurs when massive zergs collide, that’s the whole point of WvW. You’ve admitted in this first point that WvW IS a broken game mode, wether or not they want to fix it or deem it too hard is another argument. It’s a problem that’s plagued WvW for years, and a bad code isn’t the fault of the players. It’s the fault of the developers, and having them neglect their problems as you want them too and “let the players handle the issue” is absurd. Players aren’t the ones getting paid to develop this game, and it’s not their fault WvW has a system which contradicts its very purpose. 
---
2.) Subjective to an extent, but most people find it an issue. Gliding made defences way more powerful, and at this point it’s a tedious grind for most. Sure, a small minority of people may enjoy this, but defences as a whole have been too powerful for quite a while.
---
3.) “subjective” isn’t a good argument when the vast majority of players find it a big issue. If players views varied greatly on this topic, sure “subjective” could be used, but when there is a majority consensus (ofc there will always be a minority) subjectivity isn’t a valid argument against it.
---
4.) the current meta isn’t detrimental? You mean the spam of scourges and firebrands isn’t detrimental to gameplay, alienating players who want to play something else? The more scourges and firebrands, the better the squad. And this meta isn’t just “stale”. It’s been this EXACT same meta for over a year, since the release of PoF. At this point, any change that brings even a bit of class variety would be fine, something that isn’t scourge or firebrand for once. Unbalance the classes on purpose? They’re already hilariously unbalanced, so switching it up would be a breath of fresh air for most. And before you mention the upcoming balance patch, be aware that over a year of balance patches have done nothing to fix the stale scourge and firebrand meta. Sure, a couple months old meta isn’t bad, but that’s not what we’re talking about here, and if you don’t understand that, I can’t help you.

Most OCX players are on the server because of lower ping so you'll have better chance of getting a group there. There's quite a few raid guilds that run during OCX times. For me, I just made my own group =)

[okay it's alright](http://gunshowcomic.com/648)
---
Who are you to dictate how a player should play the game? If they have fun with their longbow warrior build, that's their right to play it. You have no more priority over someone else because your build is "more meta" than there's. 
---
I play on NA thats why the initial post didn't have any color-coded informatoin, as far as I'm aware we don't use the color coding here. Or we do but very very few know about it. The main post has been edited many times already to include additions from the commenters. 
---
From what I understood though from the stuff I read you can find your answer here, its the 4th bullet point on the main post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/at3k7q/tips_faq_welcome_to_wvw/egz3bj4/ . I'll let others comment and reply to this one though in case they can give more detail :D
---
Oof. This isn't good news. My sympathies to everyone who is laid off.
---
Further,
---
&gt;Yoon added that the company plans to “cut costs across the organization” and restructure across the board, merging ArenaNet and NCSoft’s publishing divisions in the process. “The restructuring, cost-cutting, and strategic realignments are all being done to secure our tomorrow and to provide the foundation that will allow us to grow and acquire,” she wrote.
---
This doesn't sound hopeful. 
---
Man... Kriegsklaue sounds like it means business.
---
Sending good wishes to all the ANet employees affected. 
---
I uses to WvW the hell out of that game mode a few years ago, but post-chemo I am so rusty. 
---
Darn, right after they offered ex-Blizz and ex-Telltale peeps a new home. Feelsmegabad
---
Many of the Hero Points in HoT are designed for groups, but they went back to solo HPs in PoF (still worth 10 points each). There are often groups advertised in LFG that will go through the HPs in HoT.
---
Wow right after posting that they had openings after the Activision-Blizzard layoffs?
---
This is sad.  Especially since a few weeks ago they were offering to hire people Activision Blizzard let go. 
---
I suppose it's because it's fresh in mind. But I felt like I was reading something about Activision Blizzard. 
---
1st them, now Anet. I wonder who is next 🤔
---
and maybe some things come into sharper focus. 
---
https://kotaku.com/guild-wars-2-developer-arenanet-plans-for-mass-layoffs-1832799804
---
You're welcome! I asked some questions to a few Vabbi boys a few months ago (I'm not even on EU) and got paragraphs of info dumped on me in response. It helped me realize how to play my classes better.  
---
See you on the battlefield! 
---
It's kotaku. I would honestly wait until we got actual confirmation.
---
Yikes.
---
Naturally, GW2 is long in the years now and ArenaNet has been working on something in the background (with delays according to the article). But a lot of this feels like it is coming from NCSoft's ever burgeoning problems rather than ANet specifically but of course cost cutting will hit every one everywhere (except the CEO).
---
Them merging ANet into NCSoft is a bit of a whopper of a detail though.
---
If anyone has watched a single Nerdslayer "death of a game" video, this is one of the signs of the Apocalypse.
---
I'm honestly puzzled. I hold my phone whichever way in one hand all the time and the Galaxy Note 8 isn't exactly a small phone, so that argument goes through the window right away.
---
Even if the app has a vertical layout, it doesn't excuse the grotesque flaw that is vertical media - it's just wrong in like 98% of cases. Though the worse offender in this case is taking a photo of the monitor instead of a proper screenshot.
---
On its own its just a minor hiccup. But it is so broadly spread out that it threatens to become a terrible norm. Cant wait to see people turning their PC monitors and TV screens vertical, too.
---
Raids yes, but not for T4 fractals. I pug when my static is away, and I see a lot of reapers as well. Boon corrupt and cc plus Transfusion is super useful in fractals.
---
gotta second this. They are not a great source of info
---
&gt;because the map currency isn't guaranteed
---
Gotta do the right events + hearts, while mining inbetween
---
Are the CEO, COO, CFO, and other top members of the publisher, going to take pay cuts in addition to the layoffs to signify their part in the situation? No? They're just going to cut the lower people that didn't have a say instead and pat themselves on the back like they actually solved the problem? Imagine my shock.
---
At some point these people are going to have to take a long hard look in the mirror and realize they and the shareholders pulling the strings are the real cause of the "not sustainable" situations. It's not the people they're laying off. It's them. It's always been the upper management making unrealistic demands and then getting huffy when they aren't met. Deal with them and the shareholders demanding quarter over quarter and year over year growth and the problems will shrink by a significant amount, almost like magic.
---
Will do sorry not a tech wizz just seen it and took a pic real quick didn’t know how long it would be up 
---
Raiding? Want stuff from the gem store? More characters? Home instance? All story done, LW3/4?
---
Jason Shreier is usually on point with his articles.
---
Thanks for all this, I added direct link to your comment on the main post :)
---
Free to play it's a win win
---
I haven't WvWed in a few years, and at that point it was less stratified than it is now. As a Mesmer (with both expansions), what gear should I be using? I used to go full zerk power mesmer but figure that might not be viable anymore.
---
I really don't like Mirage, so would prefer not to play that. I can restat ascended gear so that's not an issue.
---
This is like really bad news. Stay strong guys and hope for the best to anet working ppl.
---
Ps. NC(rap)soft to u and ur board of managers, i hope u find urs spot in hell, soon.
---
oof i feel for all the ex employees, hopefully this doenst make the company to push out GW3 before its ready.
---
It's Jason Schreier, probably one of the most respected journalists in gaming. This is legit.
---
The Article is written by Jason Schreier, who in the past has been a pretty reliable source 
---
Well, let's wait until we will get the new from some more credible source then Kotaku.
---
Jason Schreier seems pretty reliable and well-respected.
---
Kotaku maybe but Schreier has proved to be pretty legit with his articles. He's the same guy that broke a lot of stories about Blizzard and some other leaks too.
---
Very sad news. These guys work across the street from me, and first off my heart goes out to those who will be undergoing transition.
---
My heart also goes out to the community and the world of Guild Wars. What a cool place this has been to inhabit over the years, I hope this isn't the beginning of the end of it.
---
Lastly, surprised to hear this:
---
&gt; "Around 400 people work at ArenaNet, and **for the past few years they’ve been working on a number of unannounced projects**, according to one person familiar with goings-on at the company. However, that person said, slow development progress combined with a lack of new games in 2018 and 2019 has led to a financial squeeze."
---
I wonder.
---
For those of you dreaming of a game dev career, this type of news is always around the corner
---
Good. As sorry as I am on a personal level, because it's never good to lose your job, maybe now they'll actually start working on something that has some impact and is interesting. Maybe we can get some restructuring and actual workflow with results, and not one raid every year with a single item not being released for more than a year, a dev team that doesn't want to communicate or listen ("the devs should work, not talk to players" ~ gaile gray), and actual meaningful shit that isn't abandoned half way like they always do, because throwing away work into the trash bin is nice. Right, shadowstone?
---
Or we'll just get a mobile game.
---
We'll see. But this Layoff feels more than necessary from my perspective.
---
Yes.
---
This is... not good.
---
No they haven't had these options... we are talking about giving firebrand and renegade both the ability to provide alacrity and quickness just like mesmer. If it's one class giving both boons, pugs are more likely to not care if they have one of the three classes able to provide those boons.
---
Really is.  Soulbeasts are amazing at handling many different circumstances and varied group sizes and sadly commanders always assume they are useless and otherwise ignore them or tell them to play other classes.  I wish commanders in general were more familiar with the benefits of all classes and didn't ignorantly default to toxic stereotypes that discourage variety.  Here is an example of a build ([DPS Trapper](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vNMQNBlOD7kRFohXsbFwdFgqFs4IYMBgJXlLv42cnuNLgYVRLFqqV3RB-jFiAQBqb/B/pbwhq/curAAAOIAxUJYCeAAeU5XAgEAjn4pLjn4JeU8EPxT8EPxT8EPxT8IFQV60A-w)) that I use all the time that not only does amazing damage but is fantastic at applying pressure and manipulating enemy movement,  and the healing trap is shared and gives a water field and removes up to 12 condis from 5 people, but for healing there's a druid build ([Glyph Healing/Condi Removal](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vNMQJAWRnMqA1siFsCOsActgFGBzZ0FsaaMFgvVAAOqWV3qpQVtueO-jVyDQBw7BAgv9HuiyPAq+DIVCmHdBJ8CAAgjAg2OEABASAeP3D3z9A8eun75eunMVZammpZammpZammpZqUA+NzC-w)).I have that bursts at nearly 10k healing/s  and removes 1.25 condis/s (according to ARCdps).  Condi removal is not quite as high as Medi-Engi, but healing is much, much higher. Engi has more variety in its utility and ability to pressure the enemy though. I ended up switching my minstrels gear from my druid to Engi and learning that simply so that I'd be judged less (it's also quite fun).
---
i mean the massive delays in between the LS and the content drought for almost all other aspects of the game are definitely not going to help the revenue. ncsoft are probably not perfect but anet definitely share in the blame. 
---
Jason Schreier is usually pretty reliable.
---
:((
---
Maybe this will force them to focus on one thing, whether it will be future projects or live gw2, we dont know yet
---
[welcome to gw2](https://i.imgur.com/qY4p8z0.jpg)
---
You're absolutely right about that, but they could've implemented another solution for that (maybe checkpoints that provide a swiftness boost). 
---
tbh, NA requires far less kp than EU (if any). Plus having many training discords to choose from allows you to get trainings at whenever is convenient
---
With Episode 6 coming, speculations are that a legendary Accessory/Amulet is coming with it. And if that's like Aurora for LS3, the collection will require going through all maps of LS4 for achievements to craft it. So at the very least, LS4 maps will be populated again in like 2 months.
---
Normally I would agree, but Jason Schreier is one of the few good and reputable people at Kotaku.
---
I posted a link in the OP just now - the response has been staggering and I keep editing it to make new additions and such - but somebody mentioned about Vabbi Builds so you might wanna check there for a mesmer class. Keep in mind it won't be ideal and not the meta but at least you will be comfortable to play something you know. For the doublexp week consider a scourge with aoes instead.
---
Here's the comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/at3k7q/tips_faq_welcome_to_wvw/egzijue
---
That was my first thought.
---
I don't know, if they are struggling this much why not announce a new expac? That's where they get a big boost in revenue. Or is that not sustainable enough? This LW format was questionable to say the least..
---
welp, what i said all the time whenever that topic was up.  
---
anet may have the freedom of design, but when it comes to financial desicions ncsoft will have the last word.  
---
i guess at some point all the studios which are owned by bigger companys will suffer this.
---
Alright, i would still wait as far as those things are concerned. Leaks are still leaks after all. It would fit though, not going to lie.
---
&gt;Are the CEO, COO, CFO, and other top members of the publisher, going to take pay cuts in addition to the layoffs to signify their part in the situation?
---
Most likely they'll take a larger than normal bonus. Isn't that how it normally goes?
---
agreed
---
&gt; when am i supposed to be swapping between the 2 legends?
---
Swapping legends resets your energy to 50 so the best time to swap is when you run out of energy. You should also swap if you urgently need a skill from another legend.
---
&gt;as well as from hammer to staff?
---
Hammer is your ranged dps weapon, staff is your utility/melee cleave weapon.
---
Generally, you'll be using hammer + Glint with the fury and swiftness facets toggled on, spamming hammer 2 for ranged pressure and hammer 2+3 for a big damage spike. When you get in close range of the enemy zerg, swap to dwarf stance and use the elite skill for the 50% damage reduction to your party.
---
The main use of staff is for the utility, not the melee damage. The energy sigil on your staff along with staff 3/4/5 skills will help you get out of many bad situations. If your group is sitting directly on top of the enemy, staff auto attack + toggling on vengeful hammers does decent melee cleave damage. Otherwise, swap back to hammer ASAP.
---
There's no stupid combos? How about the biggest male thief/mesmer norn with afro hair? Or the smallest asura ranger with tall pet like moa?
---
Nah, you won. I focused on what I can improve, no point focusing on compliments too much. I'm a bit disappointed no one have red this thoroughly enough to point that mistake to me until 9 hours after I wrote it. Critique of my language is important to me, since English is my second language, not native one.  
---
Goodbye another expansion, this is why they are aiming to introduce xpac features to LS updates.
---
Thank you very much for this! Now my F2P friend will be able to get the expansions cheaply :D
---
Cheers
---
Can you imagine those poor workers. Well I got laid off from Blizzard but got an interview at ANET so things are looking up, sees this news story, Pikachu face. 
---
&gt; Lastly, surprised to hear this:  
---
why are you suprised to hear this? they hired a good amount of people for stuff which wasn't for gw2 (for example mobile game devs).  
---
also those slow updates / content drought together with shrinking teams (raid / fractal team) is not coming out of nowhere.
---
Wenn once did 100% outside walls of smc and all doors inside after we failed to get it 2h straight... 
---
Didn't last long thought cause we got it 5 minutes after we broke the last gate 
---
On a purely selfish note, I hope we get a conclusion to the story at least :-(
---
Hmm, minstrel chrono seems to be the thing there. Ok. &lt;3
---
I don't see anything "good" about this. Gem store and living world is probably all we're getting going forward as they're the only developments that can come with a price tag. 
---
If the mobile game rumors are true, it could actually help get ArenaNet back on it's feet as even decent games with in app purchases are highly profitable. 
---
The expansions boosted revenue but not by a huge amount you would expect. It wouldn't surprise me if the revenue from the xpacs was not enough to make  a decent profit off them.
---
&gt; NCSoft
---
Yuck.
---
No idea. Mike O'Brien seems like a pretty down to earth guy. Its possible he is doing what he can, but the numbers don't lie. GW2 still makes money but not as much as it used to. Period.
---
I'm inclined to agree with you. 
---
Sure the game is steadily declining, but this report seems a bit too acurate for me ? Kotaku basicly got the whole contents of the email the CEO sent ? Is this typical, an email from the CEO themselves being sent before layoffs ? Jason Schreier also names the CEO as a woman named Songyee Yoon; a quick google result https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NCSoft lists the CEO as [Taek Jin Kim](https://www.forbes.com/profile/kim-taek-jin/#70a107dc1eda). Maybe its outdated information. There is no source to this: 
---
&gt;according to a person who is there
---
&gt; This news comes in the wake of widespread cost-cutting measures at NCSoft. Last September, NCSoft shut down Wildstar developer Carbine Studios
---
We've kinda known Wildstar has been dead for years. 
---
**It's still likely, the game is pretty old at this point, I would just wait for an official announcement first.**
---
its not a bait either do it or shut up about it, its really that simple. Stop being such a bitch and either do it or dont mention that you could, because its obvious that you cant
---
hate to break it to you man but we passed "the beginning" of the end a long time ago. Game is long dead. Anyone still clinging to this scrap pile of a once great game is delusional 
---
It has long been hinted that Grenth has been in trouble. If he has actually been killled then the ramifications would be huge. 
---
Grenth, despite being the god of Ice, Darkness and Death, was relatively benevolent. He allowed resurrection, he safeguarded the living realm from invasion by the underworld and Dhuum’s army.  Technically we have defeated Dhuum in the Hall of Chains but I wouldn’t be surprised if something major has happened.
---
May be they'll actually get better project management and become more efficient. 
---
Oh :(
---
You just literally wrote target breaking was inherent to stealth and mesmer has had several stealth sources forever, I gave the worst example probably but target breaking has been there for Mesmer always basically.
---
Schreier is the best game journalist around.
---
I've been playing multiplayer PC games for over a decade and Guild Wars 2 in-game community was the most friendly one I've ever witnessed, and I've played all the popular MMOs since Java Runescape
---
Just throwing thoughts out there, what content do you think they will cut / stop making?
---
Raids? Fractals? PvP? WvW? PvE?
---
I mean, that's what's going to follow right? With less people, they'll have to stop some of the content they are making now, or it'll take EVEN longer.
---
&gt; Jason Schreier
---
read it again you pleb.
---
Any thoughts on what the 'unannounced projects' might have been? 
---
I hope so!
---
If it is just trimming the fat, and allthose 'extra projects' but not the main GW2 team  that'll be great.
---
They need to make a statement soon to stop mass fear spreading though.
---
Well, they've already stopped making the first three, so you have your answer.
---
Choppin' block, PvE lads.
---
Wildstar was in a coma for how long before actually being killed off?, how many launches did that game have, do you remember by any chance?, same parent company and same market (west).
---
Not saying this isn't bad though butt people are hyperventilating over this as if the game could shut down any moment.
---
The social media manager clearly wasn't updated yet on these plans... That's unfortunate 
---
Would I still use spirits? Or something else? WvW seems a lot more mobile than a raid ha.
---
I've run around in there a few times before, so I'm not totally lost, but I'd like to not be deadweight this coming week. 
---
I visit those maps to do Hearts. 
---
This is all I could think about after reading that article. Anet really shot themselves in the foot with that one.
---
Like people have said before: If what Kotaku wrote is indeed true, chances are Anet didn't know about the mass layoffs they were about to get. Hence why they offered to take some ex-Blizzard developers.
---
You have to remember this is the corp at the top's decision, Anet has no agency.
---
That's like two guys taking care of both and I'm counting in the janitor.
---
Much layoffs.
---
now they're gonna crush GW2 to fund Blade &amp; Soul 2. The cycle of life.
---
They need to crush the fear now - unless it really is bad news.
---
These sorts of leaks can spiral out of control. It can stop people playing and spending.
---
&gt; they'll have to stop some of the content they are making now
---
That's if NCSoft just doesn't close it and move all development/money to some new thing they want to do, like they did with CoH/V. 
---
Wasn't it that CoH devs were using money that was supposed to be for CoH for developing some other game? I feel like I heard that somewhere, but I just did a quick google and couldn't find anything. Maybe it is a different game I'm thinking of.
---
Should have made a better game and not blew all that money on esports all those years ago.
---
again, they are not fired immediately, these are group lay-offs, with benefits and employee protection laws, same thing happens, it's natural thing of growing businesses, you can't grow indifinetely, you need to restructure sometimes
---
The funny bit is, you're about as wrong as wrong can be. Or you're misreading my post, which is more likely.
---
I absolutely know people who played Guild Wars 1 and refused to PvP. They didn't want to. I was pretty much one of them. Thus in Guild Wars 1, I had less stuff to do. That is exactly my point.
---
My point is the more limitations you put ON YOURSELF, the less stuff there will be to do in the game. It's pretty much a factual statement.
---
The OP  has replied in several threads...he doesn't like looking at a clock. He doesn't like looking playing with other people. He doesn't like PvP or competitive stuff. So he limits himself and has less to do. The same remained true in Guild Wars 1.
---
But even then what you're saying wouldn't make sense, even if I divined your meaning correctly.
---
For the bulk of Guild Wars 1's life, when most peopled played it, you couldn't finish ALL content with heros. In fact, heroes weren't introduced until Nightfall anyway and then you could only take 3 groups in with you. Could you solo farm parts of the Underworld with a rit. Sure you could.  By the same token, people solo dungeons in this game.  Go look at some videos.
---
But more than that, there was content like the Deep and Urgoz's Warren that I did once and never did again that I couldn't solo farm because when I played Guild Wars, when most people did, you could only take 3 heros with you (and keep in mind when that content released there were no heroes at all and you had to take real life players.  No one anyone was soloing that content.  
---
A lot of dungeons and fractals in this game can be soloed, but there's challenge for people who want to solo and get better. People can also low man raids in this game.
---
You can absolutely run around solo in PvP or solo roam in WvW in this game because people do it. But the OP doesn't do competitive stuff. 
---
However, I solo roam around HoT quite frequently and usually get stuff done.  Sometimes someone shows up and helps with an event, but I'm not grouping with them. I'm just doing what I want when I want, most of the time.
---
Saying you can do this in Guild Wars 1, and you can't do this in Guild Wars 2 is showing you don't understand this game. 
---
Can everything be soloed in this game. Nah. But then lots of stuff can.
---
People who get into crafting (a great solo activity that pretty much didn't exist in Guild Wars 1) have tons of stuff they can chip away at. Most of getting a legendary is soloable. Even dungeon tokens if you don't mind PvP or WvW...oh wait, the OP doesn't like that.
---
I'd say I'm more willing to participate in more things in Guild Wars 2 than I was in Guild Wars 1, because it's more open to casuals in a lot of ways.  I was constantly wrecked in PvP in Guild Wars 1 by organized teams in most stuff.  Here I have a chance.
---
So yeah I'm going to have to disagree with you.
---
Dont worry this sounds like we might get a premium service after all
---
Looks like NCSoft having the worst numbers ever last year or w/e the Q's are is now showing affect.
---
Still waiting for another game by NCSoft....
---
You should be very very anxious about this move because they're LITERALLY doing what Anet tried to escape from by spinning off their own publishing back in... 2015? 
---
thats why i said hopefully...i don't really believe that.
---
I recently, last month or so, just got back in, and bought both expansions. Nice timing. :\\
---
The way this is being framed is odd. The merging into NCSoft is a surprise, as I thought ArenaNet had more independence. Also, had heard nothing of those mobile projects and it wouldn't make sense at all for ArenaNet considering the pace they manage with just one PC title. I don't know why they would take on a new project that isn't GW-related. 
---
It really, really doesn't, yeah. Stale game, weird changes I don't really understand and not a lot of people like, only thing left really is mount skins and living story episodes. I spent these past few months scratching my head, not knowing where we were headed and.. yeah, I guess we know now? 
---
NCSuck is perhaps one of the worst publishers ever and I do blame them for what has been happening to Gw2 slow development
---
Definitely not Druid. You will have little to nothing to offer your group nor the AOE damage to event dent enemies. Core Guardian at the very least has hammer's amazing cc, and AOE stability and boons. 
---
their PR in general is constant euthanasia pills supply
---
And that’s probably part of the problem. 
---
They announced no expansion after Season 4, so 2020 at best. They’ve spent increasing amounts on improving episodes for the LS whist the population is dropping and spending less.
---
I hate to say it, but this is a no brainer is they refused to change track.
---
Maybe it's changed recently, but WvW access opens at level 31.
---
Knew this was coming eventually
---
You're absolutely deluded if you think a game like GW1(probably what you mean by 'proper sequel' or 'rebirth' would succeed in the modern gaming climate. 
---
oh really!? damn do you have a source for that? i guess im behind on stuff too lol
---
Wasn't it a few days ago that anet employees were reacting to the blizzard lay offs with the
---
Were hiring thing. Or am I just mistaken. 
---
its a map you do once and fuck right off, you been to ember bay lately or something like that?
---
Nope, but Anet + GW2 is still running costs. if a public company is not making the fat, they gotta trim down. Its the way of it. I would rather see ANet spin off and take GW2 with them, but that's not happening. 
---
It really is inefficient, you are spending a ton of money/work on a map that most players will touch once and never again, efficient would be making content for way less money/time that players will play for months (or ideally for the lifetime of the game)  
---
GGG (path of exile) is efficient, Anet is far from it.
---
And that map does exactly nothing for the game.
---
&gt;When i heard the news, i just stopped buying gems altogether, and i believe many people did too.
---
Unfortunately I'm the same; I won't be spending a penny until there's an announcement. I'm worried this might go the way of Wildstar.
---
Well these weren't the balance changes i was expecting
---
when your marketing is giving away cars instead of promoting game and its content, that's what happens
---
they lent a hand to help there fellow gaming Brethren only to be slapped down in similair fashion by there own overlords
---
would be an absolute shame to see anything bring arenanet down as a company, honestly across the mmo space, what other company is as forth giving as them in content for $$$, hell what game in the genre has pushed what an mmo can do as much as them in the past 5 years, every ones just rehashing the same old things, no ones pushing the genre to see what it can become like they did with there mount system
---
R.I.P.
---
I can only imagine what this means for the future of the game, and it is really crushing to think about. Let us hope that some of those unannounced projects soon see the light of day and keep Anet secure, otherwise expansion 3 might come too late. 
---
It is when you consider the effort to make them and then most of those zones are abandoned after a few weeks.
---
&gt; those left will be tasked with turning the product into a stable low-cost money-maker geared around mtx.
---
Wait, it's not that already?
---
Maybe he does, but I don't know who he is or his reputation.  When I see a phrase like "according to a person who is there" it makes me scratch my head a little.  I understand protecting a source's privacy, but the wording turns me off.  Kind of like saying: "Amazon plans to buy the entirety of the internet according to person who is there."
---
Couldn't it be saved if another company bought them out? 
---
This rly sad to hear. Stay strong anet devs.
---
"The restructuring, cost-cutting, and strategic realignments are all  being done to secure our tomorrow and to provide the foundation that  will allow us to grow and acquire"
---
Wow. We've now hit peak corporate-hellscape wordsmithing.
---
Yes, Anet was hiring, but this seems to be a decision from NCsoft.
---
[Hop in!](https://i.imgur.com/GvDuUCk.png)
---
Imo it's not game that failed, it's anet as company that failed. Too much fluff, not enough meet. Not to mention their marketing is utter trash and PR doesn't exist.
---
Given how CoH was cancelled literally in the middle of a highly hyped upcoming issue that was widely discussed before as to what highly desired changes it was brining, unlikely
---
True, it's just we're seeing quite a bit of the same type of "omg, things aren't 'profitable', better lay off hundreds of people to try and keep us afloat" from publishers that are used to raking in profit hand over fist when it's really not necessary from either annualized games like COD or mobile games that print money because loot boxes. Maybe ANet has been in actual free fall for months now and this is just finally catching up to them. However it's a bit hard for me to want to jump to defend that conclusion when by metrics that sane people would use the developers are still very profitable. 
---
I'm half expecting to see a post in the next few weeks from EA and then Ubisoft to complete the circle of "publishers losing their shit because profits are down." 
---
&gt; I do blame them for what has been happening to Gw2 slow development
---
Why? NCSoft transferred publishing the game directly to anet so anet were quite independent.
---
Dammit man, read words. “Sympathies” doesn’t mean we’re angry at you NCSoft, it doesn’t mean we’re literally equating this with dying, it doesn’t mean no one knows what a layoff is. It means something shitty happened to people who are a part of a company this community cares about and some of them maybe wanna say “that sucks bro, hope things get better.” Drop the diet edgelord bit, please?
---
This has never been clearer before the Activision stockholders meeting. They announce they're laying off a ton of people, then walk into the meeting praising their record sales, profit, etc.. It's all bullshit to fuck everyone and make a pretty penny.
---
I remember it being 60 too, but unlocked wvw at 31 on a second account. Wiki shows it's both? https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/World_versus_World#Getting_there
---
Something about this stinks, hopefully Anet cuts ties in NCsoft in response
---
You think that people getting laid off means they'll release more stuff? Hmmmm
---
Here I am wanting to start a discussion about updates to fractals being lackluster (last update fractal merchants was over 2 years ago). 
---
I am not sure if that even make sense to do anymore.
---
I’ve had friends claim “dead game” over games in 20-30 area on most played on twitch.  Dead apparently is a very flexible word
---
Didn't they just take a jab at activision fie for this?
---
There are huge differences in frequency of layoffs between employers and industries though.
---
My company hasn't had layoffs in its 40+ year life, for instance.
---
Dude come on... These people have dedicated years to making this game and now their livelihoods are at risk. This is such a trashy post.
---
i wouldn't trust kotaku telling me what color snow is.
---
This. We have no idea where the game is going, right now it's simply stale. Colin did a great job on HoT and definitely did not deserved to get fired like that. Since PoF, everything just goes downhill.
---
Oh myyy. An actual screenshot.
---
The gigantic playerbase that did not buy the xpacs in huge numbers.
---
The way games are these days they're better of scrapping this game and developing Tyria Royale Online Mobile ™ and literally recieve one hundred times the revenue they are getting now.
---
It's just the sad reality of the times we live in. We are a dying breed of gamers, playing a dying breed of games. The money is at Gen X/Y and they don't play our stuff. 
---
"I don't know".   We need to know!!!!
---
Didn't they just post a message like "apply here" on their twitter for all the people that were fired at Activision? What the f.
---
Nothing like massive layoffs to ensure development progress goes even more slowly. Not growing now? Cancel all your new projects to ensure growth stops forever.
---
"Costs have gone up in the west" ....
---
Way to ensure anyone competent who can land a job anywhere in the industry has resumes sent out.
---
Way to put your customer base on edge. Why would you want to buy stuff from a game that might be closing its doors?
---
&gt; How are they unrealistic when the bar is set by their other games?
---
Because, as you even mentioned, two different games are not the same especially if one of them is being played in the mobile market place in Asia and has far more micro transactions. You can't expect a PC based MMO to require the same investment or garner the same returns as a mobile game. 
---
&gt; Being able to bring in revenue isn't the same thing as making a profit.
---
It's not, you're right. That doesn't change the fact that "profit margins" can be stupidly thought up and not take into account multiple factors only because the publisher is receiving pressure from investors who don't see reason, only their demands for their expected returns. This is especially true for companies that have seen what the mobile market can do and are noticing that certain markets are more likely to accept micro transaction than others and they make more of a profit in those markets and with those games. Instead of being able to realize that some games make more and some games make less they appear to just be looking at it as "these games aren't making 'enough' profit and they could be making more if they just did things differently."
---
Wait for shit to settle, I guess.
---
It's the thought mate, whether they get to read it or not is irrelevant  
---
I definitely return more than once
---
I'm in this boat as well. It's hard to muster the desire to invest in a game that might enter the vicious cycle of downsizing/scaling back in the face of publisher pressure. I bailed out of Neverwinter for similar reasons before moving to GW2.
---
It could mean less content and more monetisation given NCSoft is taking more control, that sounds like plenty to be concerned about.
---
Well Considering that PoF was the last major B2P content that GW2 had, I suppose I can't be all that suprised
---
So sad. ;-; First Blizzard, now Anet. I don't want to see anyone go. We're losing great people. My thoughts out to all you at Anet!
---
purchases =\= free active accounts 
---
If greedsoft kills gw2 for one of their garbage p2w game I will be sure to never spend a cent on any of their games.
---
they work on other projects. thats what they do. working for anet doesn't mean working on gw2. its right there in the article and what we where saying for years now.
---
There can be no chargeback bans on these keys as they are bundle given they don't really come via payments to Anet. But the risk is still there for scams. However these type of trade markets have enough anti-risk measures if you look for a reliable seller i highly doubt something will happen especiall on such a low-cost trade.
---
It is like trading something out of trading post for gw2. If i traded 10+ chak infusions and never scammed anyone in history, chances are i wont scam you out of 5 gold and ruin that reputation. But yea if you go for no reputation, doesnt wanna go first type of people ..well don't! Ever!
---
so if they dont read your sympathies what are they worth exactly?
---
Higher costs less return on investment, most new areas virtually abandoned after a few weeks.
---
There’s a bug mega thread on the forums. I suggest you post this in there too
---
Tbh ffxiv is such an unusual case.
---
It *should* have died with 1.0, any other company with any other MMO would have just removed and killed it right the fuck there like a tick on a dog.
---
But Square is so dedicated to the FF brand they do not like to accept failure I've noticed. So they spent all of these resources into hiring an entirely new producer and his team, let them do basically whatever the hell they wanted...........and FFXIV *still* took 2 years to start making a profit. Ag
---
Again, any other game would be killed off then and there if they hadn't seen profit for such a long time. But they didn't, and now Yoshida and his team have made the so profitable, completely in spite of the MMO market because highly unfriendly to sub based MMOs and highly unfriendly to failure, that Square wouldn't allow (according to Yoshida himself) Yoshida to stop development on the game even if he wanted to.
---
It could mean many things not a single person here right now has certainty of.
---
How about that 
---
pvp is the best and only worthwhile game mode to many of us. It's also the least supported since this game is very casual and carebear like. 
---
&gt; What a cool place this has been to inhabit over the years, I hope this isn't the beginning of the end of it.
---
ANet will need some serious stuff to announce **ASAP** if they want to turn - this time the actual active community - from the "don't invest time into this game anymore, it's dying" general mood. Our optimistic and reassuring attitude was likely the main thing that still kept the game going - without it, we're diving into a rapid death spiral starting **right now**.
---
right but.......in the game industry, it's *really* tenuous
---
Yep they are far bigger than the WoW team and Zenimax Online Studios (who develop ESO).
---
While I love the memes, I hope that all of these glitches are because they're working on a new character model for Zojja when she (hopefully soon!) gets some more screen time
---
It's also upsetting to hear that they are merging the publishing. I really want Anet to have as little to do with NCSoft as possible.
---
Will do.
---
Believe it or not it has nothing to do with your videocard or anything. It's game's fault.
---

---
But then PoE is a boring grind... at least GW2 gives something new and fun to do every 3 months. Having more grinds does not make for a better game unless you like grinds I guess.   
---
Could they improve the content? Sure but that can be said for every game ever. GW2 is doing pretty good in that regard.
---
I don't think firing the potted plants labeled "pvp team" and "wvw team" will really cut any of their expenses beyond their watering costs.
---
Aye, I haven't bought gems in years. I just convert gold now
---
I think you’re misunderstanding that those two projects represent the same amount of content and income as multiple solo titles. 
---
I really hope the Devs team do not get impacted. If content delivery becomes slower it might actually kill the game. 
---
I totally understand and even agree with this point to an extent... but uh, I was in Ember Bay last week and it was happenin' and the Chalice of Tears was full of people, events bein' called out, the works.
---
The PvP subreddit has zero action. On main forums, it still has a little life. 
---
gw2 is a game that doesn't deserve a sub fee currently
---
Who is getting fired though? That's an important question here.
---
We could be talking about non-development departments, like marketing and such, which is bad, or we could be talking about developers, which is far far worse, for obvious reasons.
---
I find it incredibly irresponsible and disgusting that management warned about the layoffs, but then didn't give any extra information? What the fuck? Oh yeah, we're gonna fire a lot of you, but we don't know who, how many, or when. The hell? That's not how you treat your employees. I've always disliked ArenaNet management (since most of the game's problems point directly at them), but today they've crossed a new milestone. Just wow.
---
For those who don't know, recently there was a huge controversy with Activision Blizzard firing a lot of people, but they were mostly non-development positions, like marketing and eSports department. Also, those layoffs came because those departments were no longer necessary, not because they needed to save money. I hope this is just NCSOFT seeing that and trying to ride the wave, and not actual "company is dying and we need to salvage what we can" layoffs.
---
why would the gods come back? they literally just finished leaving and the elder dragons are still out and about
---
ZOS with ESO as well.
---
Chrono in wvw groups is in a really bad place since december balance patch. It basicaly does CC and some unique utility (veil, illusion of life) and that's it. Can't do damage, can't heal, can't boon support. It's just crap for us atm.
---
This. If they would release 3 raid wings and 2-3 fractals a year, count me in for the sub.
---
Ok kiss kiss goodnight, I guess have fun trolling anyone else who sticks around. I’m done cooking, nothing else to feed you. 
---
you mean hopefully their revenue doesn't go down the drain and ncsoft closes arena net in the end like they did with carbine studios and wildstar.
---
It is inefficient since you put out an entire map that most players will play once and forget. It's like I'd buy a ferrari, drive it once and throw it on the pile of my other ferraris. All while I only need a bicycle to get to work.
---
It's not only about efficiency, its also about effectiveness and practicality.
---
Ooh big fella, settle down. One year and seven months. They have gone one year and seven months since releasing paid content.
---
well if everyone here keeps spouting fucking doom and gloom it's gonna become a self fulfilling prophecy
---
But fucking keep going, I guess
---
Sorry dude, but this is the truth. Accept it.
---
But we don't know what their return on investment was.
---
yeahhh.. whole marketing should be fired, they are so old fashioned and can't advertise game properly. They are much worse than for example warframe devs
---
You will most likely be kicked on druid(ranger in general), or delegated to "bad classes" party.
---
There literary isn't a single build for ranger in group wvw.
---
I don't think there was ever hope. The best we could have expected was more living world and expansions until the story was "finished." 
---
Maybe its a different game yeah, I dont remember, I was still a teenager then so quite young to even care about such corporate matters 
---
I won't even pay for a subfee for the current subfee MMOs. No game with a subfee is worth playing.
---
I'm going to vote "Maybe?". Currently I don't think this game would be worth a subscription fee. Not with inconsistent release schedule of content. There is currently no reason for me, as a player who primarily raids, to subscribe to a game where I literally have no idea how often I'm going to get my favorite type of content. Add onto this the fact that Anet barely communicates with its playerbase at all (especially when it comes to balance) and I genuinely have no reason whatsoever to throw money at this company.
---
The game's current state is stale. I'm not excited for the future of the game, Anet does not give me a reason to be excited about the future and the content I enjoy the most does not have a consistent release schedule (despite the fact that Anet has tried to tell us otherwise). If Anet steps up their game and makes some significant changes to the way they develop content and how they interact with their playerbase, then I'd consider it. But with the current state of the game, I wouldn't consider paying a subscription at all.
---
Expansions qualify as "titles", but still, one game every two years (and not a brand new title) is kinda uneasy.
---
LW could be doing worse than expected, and that would affect Gem Store sales directly too.
---
Guild Wars 2 is my main game and MMO. I've gotten a lot of time out of it, I'll still get some more of course, but this is dire news. There's very little chance things will get better for GW2. We've already gotten behind the scenes hints at how poorly organized and run the company has been, nevermind the overt examples we can point to for things like content pacing and support.
---
This only makes me feel more bad for the employees who were just doing what they could considering what they were given by the higher-ups. Outside of some major company shake-ups, I can only imagine that this will go as poorly as how many other gaming companies have turned out after facing downsizing.
---
Not good at all.
---
&gt; They promised that like five years ago and nothing came of it even remotely.
---
No! They **NEVER** promised that. **Never!**
---
They said they **would like** to make season 1 replayable, but it's **unlikely**, because new contents have more priority. 
---
Stop spreading false informations.
---
We were never getting season 1, ever. I don't know why people ever actually put any stock in that.
---
HoT maps are still played. Istan is still played. Silverwastes are still played. Meanwhile I can't even remember any of the last 5 maps they put out.
---
You can use spirits as a druid since thats how the healing build for them works yes, but if you do want more xp during the doublexp week I would suggest an aoe scourge since you can tag a lot more stuff and are more tanky - you would enjoy it more, but druid is fun too!
---
In other words: we have to fire people or we are done 
---
Damn, this doesn't bode well for the game. I can only hope this spurs them to pull a FFXIV and turn the GW2 ship in a better direction.
---
How much people do you usually see there when you visit?
---
I was memeing but at the same time i wasn't.
---
I've always been defending Capitalism, but lately, with all these big corporations fucking up not only the consumers but also their own developers just to please the shareholders, i'm starting to lose my faith in Capitalism.
---
Even WoW/FFXIV/ESO are not worth a subfee by a long shot IMO.
---
That quote right there gave me real bad City of Heroes/Villains vibes.
---
We don't even expect it anymore, for a while actually.
---
welcome to the real world. not as shiny as ingame. sucks i know.
---
also, taxi ad
---
To be fair, I think most of the controversy about the Blizzard layoffs was because they cut some very high-profile CMs (and the community would have chosen other CMs to be cut, probably), and because Blizzard gave their own people pretty much no warning that it was happening. People in Blizzard were finding out about layoffs with the rest of us, crying in the parking lot, etc.
---
oh fuck off
---
I hope fanboys are proud of what they achieved by shutting down healthy discussion.
---
This game has struggled with direction since release. You can't keep sweeping the bullshit under the rug forever.
---
I will never pay a forced subscription fee, so it would mean me leaving the game unfortunately.
---
Yeah, they fuckin focused all their resources into good sounds, sights, and acting that lasts all of 4 hours.
---
Hell no, they have no clue how to develop my gamemode.
---
Same goes in trade work. Luckily, you develop skills that land you side work until you get placed on a new job site.
---
Considering NCSoft brought up annual decline in PC revenue, GW2 might take the bullet to focus on mobile projects.
---
I think living story or whatever they call it is how they compel customers to buy the expansions and that those expansions wouldn’t do so well without it. 
---
Obviously it’s not working given how long the turn around time is between expansions. 
---
I guess it was just a whole lot easier with GW1. GW2 is a whole lot richer and deeper, folks expect a significantly different gameplay. 
---
I really hope they figure this out. 
---
This really sucks for people who did their best and have a lot of talent.  They are going to lose their jobs because the game directors made several mistakes in the direction of the game.  This is what happens when you don’t listen to your community though and don’t keep the game interesting.  It should be interesting to see where this goes and what Anet plans to do.  I love this game and hate to see it decline but it is what it is.
---
Well they could not listen to the community and give them something they don’t want ... like a mount as a parting gift
---
Wow, 400 employees? At the rate they were releasing updates and how meager they were, I thought they weren't more than 50 people at most. 
---
If you do see this maybe its worth adding to the main post. Anet has confirmed the layoffs are true and not just a rumour, related tweets here: [https://twitter.com/Gaohmee](https://twitter.com/Gaohmee)
---
There's the same story for Borderlands, Gearbox used the money that was supposed to go to their Alien game to fund Borderlands. 
---
More info can be found here but still they havent said exactly who 
---
[https://twitter.com/Gaohmee](https://twitter.com/Gaohmee)
---
I would rather they just charge $40 for the living world seasons.
---
(EU; 17:00-21:00 London time) I played on Sandswept Isles for a few weeks straight and it was pretty damn populated. Doing some collections on Kourna now, and it's not dead either.
---
Since how the game was handled post-release, I would say. Too many dumb experiments, and no solid growth and plans.
---
GW2 missed lot of huge opportunities during the first months, because the developers were busy with stupid temporary events.
---
Even then it would still be among worst supports for wvw. Pve needs it because of dps boosts and single target CC. In wvw you need boon spam, lots of condi cleanses, stability, heals and reflects. Druid doesn't offer many of those and astral force generation can be pretty wonky. 
---
Even soulbeast performs as a better support compared to druid, but still not good enough to be considered good wvw support.
---
Sure you can play it and go roam. You just won't get into squad in WvW just like you'll get kicked and laughed at in fractals/WvW. 
---
I'm not sure what your point even is here.
---
Terrible but hilarious 
---
No one is being fired. They're being laid off. They are different things.
---
It makes me a bit sad to see the first signs of the finish line for gw2 :(
---
That's pretty unfortunate, although I'm kind of surprised it's taken this long. Not happy about people losing their jobs of course, but there's been lots of talk over the years about ArenaNet having a lot of very inefficient employees. 
---
No. It was more about: newly hired accountant douchebag from NCSoft going through the company's records, cocking his eyebrow and going: so you made only 20 raid bosses in the past 4 years? Where's 6 wings per year. Also you destroyed esport and pvp? YOU'RE FIRED. 
---
What would be interesting to me: Who forged **his** chains when he was bound in the mists?
---
I'd rather pay 10€ or so every few months to get good content that lasts a while (Raids, CM Fotm or good open world content) than more forgettable maps and story instances like the last few LS or fotms where the only replayability comes from them being a daily.
---
There is not much of a reason to even spend money on the gem shop if all the content they add barely lasts for 3 days (apart from timegated stuff)
---
https://www.mmobomb.com/news/ncsofts-q4-2018-financials-almost-across-board/
---
core Guardian still fine 
---
&gt; For those of you dreaming of a career
---
Nope. I play GW2 because it has no subscription. I stopped playing any game that has a subscription because very few warrant it and I hate feeling like I need to play a game just because I'm paying to lease it.
---
Subs also encourage developers to stretch content out or add in a bunch of busy work, which I'm not into. I have a handful of cellphone games for that, I have no interest in paying to do stuff I don't enjoy after I already paid for a copy of the game.
---
Their problems lie in their content model. Your monetization model can be perfect, but if your game sucks, the customers won't be there in the first place.
---
