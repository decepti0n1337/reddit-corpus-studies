I don't think the original concept of the "living world" was any important, just another overrated idea of theirs, which sounded great on paper, but dumb or outright unfeasible on reality. Most people never gave a damn about that dream of theirs.
---

---
What made LW1 great across most players was the cadence, the story variety, and the open world content, most of which could be brought back easily, thanks to a simple trick:
---
**Duplicate instances**
---
You say Kessex Hills can't go neither back nor forward. I say that's dumb, you could easily make multiple instances of Kessex Hills, each on a different timeline. It's not something you could reflect on the world map easily, but that's unimportant anyway.
---
Having duplicate instances would let us experience different events on the same areas. Following the Kessex Hills example, we could have:
---
* Original 15-25 Kessex Hills, with all the original level experience, present at the world map.
---
* Toxic Kessex Hills, for level 80, not present at the main world map (maybe at another, moving a timeline slider or whatever).
---
These duplicate zones don't even need to respect the exact boundaries of the originals. For example, using this approach Lake Doric could have included Divinity's Reach as well. In the end these are new instances, where we copy+pasted the terrain from already existing zones.
---
That's the best solution, imo. They should have gone this route, but they were obsessed with the dumb living story approach, where the world had to be realistic and the events had to leave a mark. I still can't believe to this day that someone approved such retarded idea, specially in a game like GW2 where events replaced classic questing, and zones are supposed to be dynamic and change back and forth (town is attacked, you have to rebuild, rinse and repeat).
---
TL;DR: You can alter a map as much as you want, as long as you're working on a copy and the original is still ingame, intact with all the original events.
---
---
---
It's ok!  They're looking at rebalancing the Warclaw!  Everything is A-OK.
---
&gt;Given the gap between Season 2 and Heart of Thorns, and Heart of Thorns and Season 3, and how different Season 2 and Season 3 are, there was no footing present there either.
---
How are they different? The format was the same, its just the ammount of maps and episodes shifting around. Its what established.
---
Season 2 -&gt; Expac -&gt; Season 3 -&gt; Expac
---
Why d you think anet reassured us that the "saga" would have expansion worthy features? Because they know they've set the expecations for seasons to follow expansion and vice versa.
---
&gt;They did so with Season 4, when they began working on non-GW2 projects instead of an expansion.
---
Several issues with that.
---
1.) There were still people working on gw2, as we were reassured that "everyone fired was working on non gw2 projects" we don't know how true that is, but assuming its true, then what was the gw2 team working on?
---
2.) Assuming the projects were no cancelled, what was the plan for gw2?
---
&gt;Maintenance mode means no releases. 
---
You're right, tiny bland hour long releases every 2 months and constant updates is so much better.
---
&gt;And was there a point to you deleting then reposting the same exact response?
---
I doubleposted due to iffy internet right now.
---
&gt;That actually wasn't an insult. Honestly, if that makes you feel insulted and drives you to have the need to lash out, then I feel sorry for you and suggest therapy. 
---
It absolutely was an insult, you're presenting the other person as hysterical with the "oh god" and the caps lock.
---
If you're going to pretend it wasn't, you're only proving me right about you being a little bitch.
---
For a second I got excited thinking Bit was playing the game again...But no it's just some guy patting himself on the back way too hard over nothing.
---
I can't imagine being in the mind of somebody that would want to do this so much they are that fast at it
---
Ok, I will. Have a nice day!
---
-This has always been a week argument put forth by pve fairweather players who want to k-train for loot. 
---
Have you seen the reward tracks? The Ascended armor looks Meh and the weapons look horrible. What else is there? Hell you can't ever get the good PvE rewards and I don't EVER PvE for any reason. It not the story but the gameplay that I dislike.
---
--The only class that has no use outside of roaming is ranger. Even thieves can skirt a zerg and pick off people and engi is now top comp material
---
Just because your class has a use doesn't mean they aren't fucking broken. How many classes now have near limitless dodges, with healing, damage, and little in the way of weakness. Ele is basically unkillable, Condi Mes is pure cancer, Stun Warrior, perma stealth thief, and Condis in fucking general. 
---
Alliances (if done correctly) will fix some of the big issues in WvW. If it links large groups of people spread across multiple time zones and servers, we will not longer have peak player times. You will be able to get into WvW anytime of the day and ethier group up or roam.
---
That’s what I thought. 
---
&gt; Bye!
---
Are you taking one of those breaks from the internet to calm yourself down? I’ve heard they help.
---
aka Retail WoW
---
Except, it works far better with WoW.
---
He has a point, but that point is irrelevant. Fun gameplay is the basis, without it you won't play. Great rewards are the best, mediocre rewards won't change much, bad rewards can offset great gameplay. You can't offset bad gameplay with great rewards.  
---
  
---
Sounds like OP has an issue with how bad rewards have become.
---
we quit. have you tried path of exile?
---
Why does he look like Chris Pratt in the bottom photo?
---
Strike .missions are a crock of shit. They are basically a bounty boss inside an instance! Thats all they are!
---
Thank you! This is very helpful :)
---
Yeah I really don't get why we don't have hard mode yet.
---
*Simply* add instabilities to dungeons, that would suffice for some time at least. Amp up the rewards a tiny bit and I'd play a lot more, add them to the daily routine.
---
[removed]
---
I'm a newer player, trying to feel out what class I want to main, and would appreciate some advice there. 
---
My main focus at endgame is probably going to be on clearing fractals, and eventually moving into raiding. I'm coming into the game solo, so something that plays nicely in PUGs would be preferred (I'm open to using a support build), but my main dealbreaker is that I don't really enjoy playing super high APM classes.
---
You can swap the stats at the mystic forge, whatever the case may be.
---
It's really easy to skip out on events when doing tasks as they sometimes don't spawn over the task.  This removes a good chunk of EXP from map comp as you're now not doing events.  This is even more true if you also skip all the events and gathering on the map while doing things that don't involve killing mobs.
---
I've played Skyrim for well over 1000 hours, where is the reward there?  There's nothing I haven't collected or done in that game, but I still replay it and am certain I'm not the only one.  Different people enjoy different things.  Some folks don't need rewards to keep doing something and just enjoy the doing itself or find it to be relaxing.  You're not wrong for wanting rewards, but they're not wrong for not needing them.    
---
In Gw2 I mostly just pick a map for the day and run around in it doing dynamic events, or gathering, or participating in the meta, or jumping puzzles.  I'm not farming or gathering or saving gold.  I have thousands of gold and it's not really a concern of mind.  I'm not working towards rewards, I am simply relaxing in a low stress environment and that's not an incorrect way to play.  
---
You like challenging yourself (I assume) for interesting rewards and that is also not an incorrect way to play. Personally when I want to challenge myself I solo or duo/low man content that was meant for larger groups, like t4 fractals or dungeon paths or strike missions.  Sometimes instead I roam in WvW or fight in the guild arena with some of my guildies.    
---
As with most MMOs you have to decide what end game is fun for you.  If you really genuinely can't find any fun in any available options, maybe the game isn't right for you.  No game has ever held my interest with good rewards if the game itself was shit to play.  In fact usually the moment rewards get involved the gameplay to me becomes a chore instead of fun. "Oh... I want skyscale that but I guess now I have to collect 250 of each map currency..."  I might have already picked one of those maps to run around in for the day, but now that I am forced to for a reward it's no longer fun to me.
---
Let's just hope Visions is the Current Events replacement then.   Granted, I'd also argue that it's not out of the purview of what the characters we've got can do to go into Fractals.  They've already been to Edge of the Mists when Taimi's original golem did something I can't recall at the moment and Fractals were introduced in season 1.  But that's just my two cents.
---
SWTOR is finally releasing Raid content again? That only took, what, 4 years? lol  
---
That game still sucks no matter what way you slice it. It went downhill quickly after SoR.
---
This is a really good game for people with limited time, for a lot of reasons. You don't need to do the hardest content in order to get the highest level gear. Nor do you need the highest level gear to do most of the content.
---
I see this game is diametrically opposed to WoW. Imagine an MMO that released two expansions and neither introduced a new tier of gear or raised the level cap in either. From a WoW point of view, that would be unheard of. There are no quest hubs here, so your path for leveling is less linear.   
---
There are a lot of differences and the game should feel very different particularly because there's no bread crumb trail.
---
I'd recommend you try it, but don't bring a lot of your WoW experience with you. Try to play it with "new eyes" so to speak. A lot of former WoW players are here, really enjoying themselves. Others come here and dislike the experience.
---
No way to tell how you'll react.
---
Why does it have to be a replacement at all? Why are people obsessed with the notion of replacements?
---
Also I wouldn't look at Season 1 for how ANet does things since the delivery of S1 changed every 4 months and during S1 they made **every** update somehow involved in the main cast. Even Wintersday ended up being used for the main cast's plot.
---
They've maintained Fractals as 100% unrelated to the main cast and story since the Fractured release.

I'm mainly looking to wvw, using this guide to try to help narrow down class choice: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guide:What_Profession_Should_I_Play
---
Engineer and warrior both sound up my alley. I like playing bruiser types that don't die easily and can 1v1 or 1v2. I'd like to be able to Zerg or large group, but also solo a bit.
---
Seems like warrior might be a better bet? Same profession for wvw small scale and zerg, versus engi that has to swap.
---
Any input is appreciated, thank you!
---
I was actually thinking about them adding an easy mode for new raid wings if they want everything to be accessible. And it would be good for raid population.  But with strike missions we only get the easy mode. Ofc it could be that they are monitoring how popular they are and judging by that, perhaps add a hard mode later. But let's be real here, it's not gonna happen.
---
Sure, in an ideal world there'd be a hard mode as well but at the moment raids don't even manage to guarantee a decent development time.
---
I know I have a few stacks of the toolboxes that give out harvesting tools.  Those give you snowflakes on harvest, available year round while your supplies last.
---
&gt; Why does it have to be a replacement at all? Why are people obsessed with the notion of replacements?
---
Hokay, so, Fractals replaced dungeons, right?  That's what happened with Heart of Thorns.  Then LW replaced Expacs which then had Expacs replace LW which finally has come full circle.  This is why people are worried that this sort of thing will replace content they enjoy.
---
&gt; Also I wouldn't look at Season 1 for how ANet does things since the delivery of S1 changed every 4 months and during S1 they made every update somehow involved in the main cast. Even Wintersday ended up being used for the main cast's plot.
---
Yeah, the whole point of LW was to make a believable world that changes with the times.  It's only fitting that the main cast would know about and celebrate common Tyrian festivals.
---
&gt; They've maintained Fractals as 100% unrelated to the main cast and story since the Fractured release.
---
And nothing's really stopping ANet from going back and using this content to make or build a story aside from their vision for what they want from the story.
---
lmao what the fuck
---
&gt;why do we care?
---
As it has been pointed out: You won't know if you will care until you play it since making you care about Ryland is obviously the intent of it. It's a weird way to go about it but content is content. I just hope he plays better than Caithe did.
---
Personally I think the other members of Dragon's Watch would have been better subjects for it but I'll give it a shot when it gets released. Maybe Anet's big secret is that the game mode is going to be a way to see what your pals have been up to without you and this is just a test run. Or it could be future abandoned content like the dungeons. No one knows squat about it at the moment but Anet.
---
Perhaps, but you'd have to have gotten them via GW2Exchange or RMT or a gift so I don't see what's different between having them (which can get you punished) vs selling them.
---
I agree that anet should do a better job of figuring out when someone is the actual intended recipient vs someone who it was further sold on to, but I don't see what the problem is with getting punished for RMT if you sold an item obtained (directly or indirectly) via RMT on the TP. You'd be punished for simply owning it - what's the difference?
---
The key is that you can't be punished for *buying* things on the TP regardless of those items' source, so if you only get items through the game or TP, you're never going to have any issues.
---
How do they monitor that? I did a strike mission once. We one-shot the boss. I never did any strike mission ever again because why?
---
Now, does their monitoring consider I ragequit and do they make strike missions even more easy? That would be fun!
---
&gt; Then LW replaced Expacs which then had Expacs replace LW which finally has come full circle.
---
That's not what replacement means. That's called *cycling*.
---
Yes, Fractals replaced Dungeons, and this was done because players just skipped content over and over. Same reasoning was used for why Fractals went from 3 randomized instances to just 1 instance of team choice - because players would just reset until they got the easiest-to-skip first instance (Swampland).
---
ArenaNet stopped working on dungeons because they saw that players wanted more streamlined, simpler content. So they made that via fractals and, eventually, raids. Notice how fractals and raids don't have so many non-boss sections? There's your reasons why.
---
&gt; Yeah, the whole point of LW was to make a believable world that changes with the times. It's only fitting that the main cast would know about and celebrate common Tyrian festivals.
---
Not arguing for or against their involvement in the festivals during Season 1. My point was that the main characters of Season 1 were always involved in every update. Even something that otherwise had  no - or needed no - involvement in the main plot, like Triple Trouble, Tequatl Rising, or Edge of the Mists.
---
Just wait until they abandon strike missions as well. Just like dungeons, fractals and raids.
---
&gt; Yeah, good on you for pointing out that the main story is, in fact, not repeatable, long-term content. Which is a problem of GW2, since, well, weve been mostly getting story with new releases and thats it. 
---
Maybe it's not a problem of GW2, but your expectations of GW2. Considered that?
---
Honestly, when you can't play a game for the *enjoyment of the game* but instead require rewards for doing something, to me, I just see people treating it not as a hobby, or a means to have fun, but as another job of theirs.
---
But hey, if jobs is what keeps you happy, you do you.
---
&gt; Im... what. Raids and fractals are "marketed" side content? Wut. Did you ever touch this game or do you just lurk here?
---
Been playing the franchise since 2006. Fractals and raids are never required for the story of the game, or for progression. They're just optional end-game content. Which, some would argue, makes it side content. Because it's not the main focus of the development - which is the Living World.
---
Of course, one can also argue that is GW2's weak point - but I'm not here to argue semantics. My point is that raids and fractals have always been tacted on benefits, and never the primary direction of things.
---
Not that this is at all relevant to what I was saying before.
---
Did they remove the old ones? If the problem was that not enough folks were going those, then why make more yet.
---
Heck, Wing4+ would all be new to me. Only existing raiders need new raids, and that's not the target audience.
---
Usually not a fan, but for mesmer I agree.
---
You know that raid builds and WvW builds and PvP builds are suboptimal for Open World right?
---
Don't you think it doesn't make sense to try to shoehorn in 1 build for all game modes? Why do you think people wanted build templates so badly? Its so that they can have all their gear and traits setup for different situations and game modes. A guardian is in amazing place because it can have so many viable builds for different game modes. Hell it even has 2 good DPS builds. Firebrand if a fight favors condition damage or Dragon Hunter if it favors power damage. Open up to different possibilities and you'll truly understand how the game works.
---
WvW commanders shell out a lot of gold for blueprints and such and it's not uncommon for someone in their squad to donate gold.  20g and a "thanks for the squad!" and a comm wouldn't even think twice about accepting it. Same for raid sellers, people running HP trains and metas, or even the JP mesmers if a troll really felt like messing up some random person's day.
---
Raids and fractals, pretty much dps role of any other mmorpg
---
I remember.... it was me
---
They should just increase the cap.
---
Ive got no idea. You should try it on the forum or contact the support directly
---
Yes. if youre new you can have hundreds of hours of fun with the game
---
Tell me, plainly and simply, what "expansion like content" we have received now that we're in the saga. There have so far been no features to come which would be reserved for the release of an expansion instead of living world.
---
Posted here for good measure, it is also in the forums!
---
To me the game is still amazing and heading in direction i all but mind. The things playing here are at big part player preferences, but overall, the biggest issues atm, are big lack of hardcore endgame content. Raids, fractals, proper competetive updates, we didnt see either in a good while. While i agree the game isnt in a great state, i personaly hate the "maintnance mode" thing, cause i really dont see it happening. Sure, these gamemodes were at least for now kinda forgotten, but Anet so far is showing solid investment, just the fact we are getting roadmap means something. But im overall very positive person, plus i enjoy all content in the game, so im prolly not the right one for this conversation.
---
Because the drop rates are abysmal.
---
except there are artificial rewards in the achievements and popups you get and the new things you unlock in cookie clicker. its the same feeling. if it was just a webpage with a cookie on it and nothing else literally no one would play it.
---
Yes. The saga is what we’re getting instead of an expansion. It has less than an expansion.
---
We’re getting visions instead of fractals. Rather than group content that takes us through history, it’s solo content that takes us through history.
---
We’re getting whatever you wanna call that mess of a system is instead of movement based masteries.
---
What we have mow, replaces, what we had before. And what we have now. Is less superior.
---
Show me where all the fractals, raids, and expansions went.
---
They got replaced
---
I personally find the bells a much relaxing way to farm. Just pick lower part and you honestly only need to hit the 4 6 8 note using 1 hand when they arrive and you will easily pass the song. Much less concentration needed and less variables than the JP (looking at you, max size charr with robe) 
---
Also, same with the JP, if you stay in the instance long enough it might start closing so you'd be left with 4-5 other farmers and songs will have 0 breaks.
---
Finicky aiming? You mean the camera trick to use weakening charge in place that was made obsolete with a patch 2 years ago?
---
Multiple dramas like pretty poorly done marketing events like friendship some years ago. 
---
NCSoft laying of, at that time, half of anet developers, cause anet mismanagement their other projects (anet always hat pretty poor upper management) which a lot of resources went into instant of gw2.
---
Their "big announcement stream" which had like 50k viewers and many expect something big like HoT or PoF, only to get the biggest disappointment in this game history served to them (basically we could only expect ~~living story~~ saga from now on and other game modes will be neglected from what we could saw and estimate). It certainly didn't help at all that ~15 minutes of their 45 minute total announcement time, where plain merchandise advertisement (pretty cringe ones at that aswell) just shoving that bad taste for what little we could expect from anet and what the future hold from now on, crushing a lot of hopes...
---
They said for quite a while now, that we will get expansion worthy content with this new saga (their excuse for not giving us an expansion like HoT) and we got nothing like that at all so far, no new elite classes, raids/fractals, no game-changing new additions like mounts or gliding aswell.
---
The only one close to that would be build templates now (unraveling all of that drama and bad about it would be to big to list here) but basically it forced us to stop using the third party tool which thousands of the pve community where used to for years and replaced it with their poorly implemented one, with heavily limits their playstyle for those players with only allowing 6 different builds (and that's if you pay up big time) which is to low for players who **actually** used and need build templates (it is great for the ones who don't need it, but bad for the ones who play many different roles and game modes with their chars).
---
If that's not enough already, those "build templates" pretty much started the trend where it was starting to get clear that anet monetization is getting way way more aggressive from this point on. You would need to cash out like 200-400 € ? (idk on the top of my head) just to get at least 6 builds for the 9 classes, they justified it with freeing inventory slots, which no one asked for, just to slap a high price tag on it.
---
They basically triple monetizing this feature for what would have been free if it would have come out in the first years of gw2 (which this should have).
---
And they didn't stop there ... another long asked feature from the community were capes, well we sorta got them, but their intention to implement them was mostly just to sell us every cape in the gemstore instant of proving us those as endgame rewards (which this game is lacking) we only got single very basic plane one serving as a teaser to make us buy those in the gemstory. There are almost 200 mount skins now and not even one is offered as ingame reward so dont expect it chancing for capes aswell.
---
On that topic, it is worth mentioning that while we get pretty much no meaningful endgame content anymore, anet putting more and more only over the gemstore. In a game where the endgame is supposedly the cosmetics, theirs a problem when you provide almost all skin via the gemstore instant of offering more of them via endgame rewards making the content more worthwhile doing and providing more motivation to the players. That the few endgame rewards we get are vastly inferior versions from just getting one from the gemstore doesn't help either. Legendaries kinda become meaningless with them beeing so low in quality compared to so many gemstore skins now (many of with are over legendary tier and would have been nice if at least some of them would have been earnable with ingame content),  the fractal infusion, which is a rare endgame loot, having only a very low-resolution texture and looking extremely poorly, while all of the gemstore items with **exactly** the same effect is getting the high-resolution version for them (anet is still refusing to update the ingame earnable one with the current high resolution one).
---
On a recent interview from 3 weeks before they said they not giving raids, fractal and new legendaries any priority or resources for them right now.
---
Knowing that they kinda have everything planned out in their roadmap, for at least to episode 3 of the saga and how long they needed to work for the last raids, we cant expect new contend for those game modes the next 7-12 months (and that's **IF** they would work on it right after episode 2).
---
And that's with like a year without any content for fractal players already, the last 2 fractals we got didn't provide the quality players were used to either and where pretty disappointing.
---
The raid wings 6 and 7 took almost a year to get out, while the quality dropped with each one, players were requesting multiple difficulties for them like story and challenging mode, to make them more accessible for casual players while also providing more challenging content and meaningful rewards for more committed/veteran players (something gw2 really lacks across all game modes).
---
WvW players have it even worse pretty much no content or even attention from anet for 4-5+ years, anet are way to disconnected to us to know what this game mode actually needs.
---
The once we got, the mount, is hated by many veteran WvW players esp. roamers, also because how poorly it was implemented, which clearly just served the purpose to sell mount skins regardless what it would do to the game mode.
---
Also holding the carrot that "the solution to WvW problems"
---
Alliance system for over 2 years now and repeatedly saying that it is "actively" in the work and we can expect it in the coming months, just to downright insulting the WvW community on their big announcement stream mentioned above, where many expected that this was finally the time, or more like: now or never with providing us the Alliance system, only to downplay the WvW community and their gamemode, with just saying yet again that with what they said for 2 years since they announced this system, that they are working on this system and we can expect more about it in the coming months (which are already over btw).
---
At that moment most WvW players know that we can't expect anything anymore before this game mode will die out from the lack of players. WvW was already slowly dying, after this it just got way worse with multiple WvW guilds disbanding and 30-50 % quitting the game the next weeks. NA esp. I heard its pretty empty outside of T1 matchup.
---
Lets not even talk about sPvP while it can be expected to get a bigger update, anet neglect it to many times for too long esp with poor balancing and is close to death in terms of active players.
---
Sorry for end spelling errors and that like, its to late for me, theirs much more worth mentioning like anet banning, again and again, innocent players, while pvp bots open in their air get unharmed, or that gw2 is turning more and more into a mediocre singleplayer game. Anet not caring about guilds and communities (for a MMO its baffling how ignorant you can be), letting them just die out. Or that most new maps after first expansion have close to no player activity anymore just after 1-2 weeks they are out, because they lack replay value. But I will leave it at that for now :)
---
There's that icon already. It looks like the black one with roman numerals in tiered achievements, but with an infinity symbol.
---
But for some reason it only appears in a few repeatable achievements.
---
I don't know what answer you want.
---
1000 hours of gaming for $20, for a new player, seems OK to me.
---
It's way more if they bother to do all the cheevo's, etc.
---
The answer probably is "go and play another game", at least until they add something. That's not what you want to hear I guess, but it's the reality.
---
*shrug*
---
Sidenote: I see this argument from long time players in EVERY mmo. People making MMO's simply cannot outpace consumption by players. Some companies are worse or better than others. Even in WoW for example, people complain, "Theirs nothing to do."
---
Maybe some activities just have a lifespan, and then you move on. You'll be replaced by someone else.
---
Yikes...
---
Nah, I mean landing your bounding dodge on small sized enemies.
---
That's true, I forgot about the big nerf. 
---
Don't know why they couldn't do a pve split to not ruin the trait.
---
Oh wow! There is a lot to unpack here. Thank you very much for the detailed info. 
---
By all accounts it sounds like Anet is running their game into the ground, partly due to mismanagment. At the rate its going, from the sounds of it, I don't think it will last longer then 3-4 more years tops before stuff becomes a ghost town then. Hell, GW1 might have more active players if Anet keeps ruining player goodwill. 
---
I am very sorry to hear about them crashing the market and really focusing upon the microtransaction element of the game. Sure, back when I played I spent a little too much, but that was mostly on dyes and the unbreakable gathering items back in the day. 
---
I am also really sad to hear about the state of WvW. I honestly LOVED that mode back when it was first added many years ago. There was something fun about running with a large group of people just taking objectives. Completely opposite of what Anet had wanted from the mode based upon patch notes back in the day.
---
As a side note, you mention Anet having other side projects. As far as I was aware the only active game they had was GW2 and keeping the servers up for GW1. Wonder if we will hear more about a future gaming project. 
---
Hell, GW2 is also starting to near that age where GW1 stopped receiving stuff too. Already on Expansion 3, same as what happend with GW1. Only, the last expansion to GW1 was set up specifically because they were working on GW2. 
---
Honestly, I kinda hoped we would get to see the end of the whole mess with the Elder Dragons before the game died. I loved the lore and world that Anet had created, hell, many years ago I bought the books for GW2 as well because I wanted to see more form the world.
---
Have you spent thousands of hours reading the same book? or watching the same movie?
---
Not the first time they made this switcheroo see dungeons
---
It's not early, not at all. If anet had anything big like expansion features in their books they would have tried to advertise it to keep player retention and some publicity. They don't have anything like that. It's just a glorified living world season like the rest with some new maps and collections. The "expansion features" promise was just a carrot for those stupid enough to believe it. Call it a desperation move if you'd like.
---
I mean they consider 500 cooking and this horrific loadout system "expansion features" which proves that they have set the bar very low. These are the prime example of what they consider expansion features, take it or leave it.
---
Hola mi name Ali habdal badoolee. I no speak ingles, I helpdesk ok! Wat you problim???
---
feelsbad reading all this. so are we allowed to play the game anymore or not???
---
Yes, highest buyer gets it first. Which is why they are almost exclusively traded on gw2exchange instead of TP, where higher payers  *can* pay higher.
---
You can say that it shouldn't be sold for more than 10k, but the fact that it is (on gw2exchange) says something about its actual value.
---
and Anet will not refund u and its your fault for not predicting it. They have stated this so many times why dont people understand. Customer is always guilty for them.

Not at all with this balance, you are completely wrong. It's a cheap trick where people passign by or legit sitting on mounts waiting to instant stomp. It's so stupid.
---

I mean there's a clear point where things go wrong. Remove sales and marketing from the equation and it doesn't devolve. The reason promising games go to shit is because instead of being able to cater to what the fans want and actually enjoy, people from a completely different sphere with no passion for the medium are brought into the company hierarchy and prioritised over the people who made the game great in the first place. 
---
Of course online games need marketing teams and sales teams and people to keep the checks and balances in order, because it is hard work bringing in revenue and managing finances in a way that keeps the game running, be it server upkeep, the general costs of running a business like paying employees and managing taxes as well as further investment and development, but these roles are just as important as the people developing the game, not MORE.
---
When the hierarchy of game development shifts from passionate devs creating art they want to share with the world being in charge to devs becoming a minor asset with executives and investors and business people who merely see these things as an opportunity for profit at the top, things take a drastic turn. The focus is no longer to share what the devs have created with the world for the enjoyment of consumers, but to use the creation and consumerbase as a means of extracting wealth.
---
With devs being pushed aside and their input becoming mostly unimportant, they lose their passion. This along with the gruelling world of game development, 60+ hour work weeks and "crunch time" on top of that sometimes leading to 120 hour work weeks with no overtime pay or possibly even no extra pay at all despite workload doubling, pitiful if any unions to back them up (I would have to look into game dev unions to be sure but from what I've seen ... well, I haven't ever seen a union so) and do something about it, devs are ultimately powerless outside of having some heavily scrutinised agency in *what* is being created, and only the what, the quality of production takes a swan dive off Mount Everest.
---
Meanwhile with parent companies and executives and stock holders and whatever other bigwigs there are out there having near full control over everything else, from sales models to the specifics of how to implement content, who stays with the company and who is cut regardless of seniority or experience or role, the outcome is almost always the same.
---
Devs who worked their asses to the bone to scrape together the resources and infrastructure needed to have any chance in a vicious and brutal industry, working for table scrapings and sometimes for nothing at all finally have all their hard work pay off in the form of a successful game only to find that once they get there, their success is rewarded with executives and businesses taking control, implementing predatory at best profit generators, and being thrown to the wayside while still being forced to work just as hard and long for wages that can maybe put food on the table if they're frugal while people who played no part in their success swoop in and take any and all earnings except for what they're legally required to pay employees (and usually not even that). It's impossible to not become disillusioned with the industry and as a result of that, the extreme burnout from working such ridiculous hours and the fact that anything they want to do has to boost quarterly earnings or be scrapped, the quality of the game plummets.
---
On top of all that, the utterly moronic general public of the gaming community has gotten it into their heads that all these unsavory and predatory money making practises are somehow because of "greedy devs", and the general vitriol towards developers who literally have no say in the matter and don't even make a penny off of them, and should a game dev sign with a distribution company that offers a better deal for them because devs deserve to be paid for their hard work, they're boycotted and review bombed for having the audacity to take a better deal.
---
Then of course there are the billion other issues within the game development industry that serve to make matters significantly worse that I won't even bother going into because this is already a novel.
---
You assume that devs have a choice in what they're assigned to make.
---
Damn race supremacists and their race scarfs!
---
I'm 1k hours in and started getting into raids 3-4 months ago after finally getting caught up with LW story. 
---
I now regularly clear wings 1 and 4. I just full-cleared wings 2 and 3 for the first time today. I got my first legendary weapon Bolt a month ago and now working on legendary armor. On the side, I'm working on my skyscale. 
---
Bottom line, for me, progression and rewards are definitely there assuming I can find time to raid.
---
But, I can see how I'm just playing "catch-up" with the raid content and how I'll hit a wall at some point. I'm not quite there yet and will not be for a while, at least until I can secure some legendary armor. :) 
---
Having said all that, I do see hardcore players leaving the raid scene and I'm a bit sad. I want them to stick around so that I can finally catch up to them and raid side by side. But oh well.
---
While we’re at it. Different dyes if a piece of armor is in two different sets
---
Yeah, that's pretty much why I posted it. If you have key drops or farms saved, it's nice for trying to grab something you might want, but I would never, EVER advise spending money on keys. You can straight up \*buy\* things in the gem store for less money out of pocket that are comparable most of the time anyway.
---
you gave me a reason to hack js games again :(
---
Yes, and I still think the resulting combat is less because of it. Originally, GW2's condition damage was supplementary to power builds, adding a bit of flavor, but otherwise not the main course. In 2015, they made a lot of radical changes to allow some builds to specialize into condition damage properly, and now the combat is slightly lesser for it. Condition DPS still doesn't fit in very well, and because of the way you gear for it, has some really unfair advantages over direct DPS builds, even if there weren't any situations where condition damage was purposely made strictly better.
---
Yet, two damage types is a reasonable amount as it currently stands, because the situations in which one type is purposely better than the other are rare, and even then, a lot of those situations don't shut down one type of damage, just reduce it somewhat. I do think complete immunity to one type of damage is problematic, but since there are only two types, it's not difficult to have a mixed group of both types of specialists.
---
That bit where he says "you can show yourself out" was top notch
---
I'd suggest caring about mounts at later time and enjoy exploring the core world because with mounts you'll miss a lot of scenery and just rush around. Mounts did changed the movement around maps and also make people behave worse as it's common now to bomb-drop with mount on mobs and kill them instantly - which is annoying in low-level maps if you're exploring these for let's say, daily events objective. The speed of exploration and shitty behavior were two negative things that come along with mounts.
---
You got less than 2 days per offense. Could have been worse.
---
yes. when you sell stuff in TP the tracking history of the item is deleted completely.
---
You're right, it makes sense for a player to do that. I just was so heated at that point already, and I just let loose on that player.
---
Meanwhile there are hackers everywhere in GW2 and anet doesn't give a shit. Based on your behaviour and the reaction that followed, I guess 90% of the PvP and WvW community have to be banned, including myself.
---
This isn't just toxicity, you were literally using homophobic slurs. I can totally get being frustrated when the other team is rubbing in their victory but resorting to that kind of language is pretty beyond typical salty toxicity these days. I recommend trying to at least stop using homophobic slurs in your day to day life if you want to avoid future bans in games.
---
Uh, serves you right?  I report behavior like that all the time, context be damned.  :v
---
Would I have gotten banned for a single chat offense? If they view each one as an individual offense rather than a pattern of behavior then I guess I got off easy. I'm not sure how anet does things but I just blindly assumed it was based off of a pattern of toxic behavior rather than looking at every chat offense. I have never had a run in with a gm, so I never really thought about it.
---
Take time to reflect on this, guild wars 2 is just a game. The other characters you see are real people, not AI. 
---
In ranked pvp things get get steamy. Just block them and move on, you will never have to see what they type again. Bonus points on nick naming them a funny name in the block menu. I block dumb people if they display toxic behavior and at the end of the season just clear the block list.
---
It's not in my typical vocabulary, especially not in vc. Definitely not in my day to day life, but you have no reason to believe me. For sure to a team of moderators it's a no brainer, you dont want an active homophobe in your game saying that kind of thing, but I also see tons of gw2 players say much worse.
---
A weeklong ban for using not just vulgar language, but a slur on top of it?
---
It's...pretty deserved.
---
I'm happy that you have been banned. This makes my efforts to report verbal abuse time worthy.
---
You have been provoked, you felt for it, others had a double win pissing you off, then reporting and in turn suspending.
---
Word of advice:
---
If you notice someone mocking/griefing behavior just block right away. If you are getting camp stalled, pick your phone and just browse internet waiting for match to end. 
---
And if you can't hold your frustration then do not play any competitive modes when you have bad day.
---
Yepp, that's definitely a large part of why the GM pointed out the "hate speech" clause.
---
OP needs to realize that slurs are absolutely not tolerated by Anet and that if they really wanted to, they could ban OP for far longer than just a week based on just that. It's their game, their rules. And slurs are a huge offense, on top of all the other vulgar statements, whispering someone to harass them, etc.
---
Because shit is so ridicilously rare it's actually funny. Ask yourself how much is 20 gold. Nothing right? When was the last time you got a singular drop that is worth 20 gold...
---
Context is always important, but to a team of moderators they cant look into it on a case by case basis. That's why it's our job as players to properly report based on the context of a situation. I definitely deserved to be reported within the context of the situation, however I dont believe that is always the case.
---
the only real niche here is the UW mount.
---
the bird would effectively be itzel poison 2.0. temporarily diving seems rather useless and could -if absolutely necessary - be squeezed into the skimmer. and what exactly would be a point of a slow mount that increases the chances of getting knocked off it... due to being slow, and who's only gimmick - proposed visuals aside - is to compensate for that handicap by allowing you to hop back on? unless the "heavily aoe-damaged are" idea is supposed to just be yet another itzel poison 2.0
---
Yeah, I know a handful of the top players who complain about things such as hackers. I have yet to be exposed(to my knowledge) to be exposed to hackers. I feel that many players, including myself, have never even touched the report feature. I think I have reported one player in all my time on gw2, and that was for just afking in pvp. I have been exposed to dozens of toxic players, especially in wvw, and I never really think to report.
---
Yes its possible, why not,  but human error is the most probable reason haha.
---
I can appreciate that it might not be in your day to day life, hopefully people who say worse also get punished for it. I recommend working on how you handle getting frustrated in games, if it helps I used to have the same mentality in competitive games and still have to remind myself to chill out when the other team is being toxic or someone is trolling. It can be very easy to dip into the worst words you know but it's not worth it at all.
---
For me I'm unbothered by anything another player says to me. Toxicity had never really bothered, as most of the time it's just dumb shit from trolly players. I just assumed in the moment thats how others saw it aswell. I thought they would ignore it and let me be pissed off. I was wrong and I got bit in the ass for it.
---
can we PLEASE fix the issues and bugs of ~~templates~~ loadouts before we focus on aesthetic fluff.
---
hiding of weapons already introduced more bugs before the original ones were dealt with.
---
That's what I thought when I got the ban. It makes sense but it is very long for a chat offense. I have no work this week so it's very upsetting that I cant play guild wars.
---
You should get an extra week for this complaining
---
 If you're on Windows 10 go to Control Panel&gt;Network and Internet&gt;Network and Sharing Center. On the left-hand side, click "Change adapter settings". This will open a new window of various connections. Right click the connection you are using and click on Properties, you'll be under the Networking tab in the next box that opens. UNCHECK QoS Packet Scheduler and make sure IPv6 is checked. You're done. For good measure, make sure you are using the Google DNS addresses. (Don't forget to reset your connection by disconnecting and reconnecting or just restarting pc for good measure). It also helps to use -assetsrv [3.222.198.66](https://3.222.198.66) to keep things rolling! All of this combined should 100% fix your problem.
---
It's not even complaining, it was just a question  to ask if a ban this length is normal. I said I understand the ban like six different times in the post and numerous times in the comments.
---

That feature of Windows basically determines which packets are most important and will totally drop packets from the GW2 Launcher for some reason. It just doesn't have a high priority.
---
you don't get them, you simply gain the ability to use them in the scribing station.
---
&gt;"No mention of" != "cancelling".
---
Ah,  yes. Russel's Teapot, The Flying Spaghetti Monster, The Invisible Pink Unicorn, and incoming GW2 raids.
---
Where did the horns go?
---
I wouldn't say there was 1 huge nerf that did that, there were gradual small patches that made it less and less appealing(for PvE, at least) up till the point that your damage output with power staff is going to be similar or better anyways even on the bosses that favour condi damage.
---
&gt; There's nothing to fix, because nothing is broken - everything works exactly as advertised and as planned
---
So they planned to have item drop which value exceeds the TP gold limit? Must have been a long brainstorming session.
---
In your example, the restaurant does provide muffins free of charge, but you refuse to eat it and choose to starve (or to change restaurant).
---
So first you say no fractal, but then point out fractals were added.
---
It's probably more constructictive to point out what you're missing in the new fractals.
---
they could have avoided so much trouble if they had just created an account armory for non-soulbound gear, which would make more sense to monetize than seperate gear slots, especially considering legendary gear. still cannot comprehend how they could have possibly thought their concept would be a good solution.
---
You could've played GW all week if you hadn't been taking out your anger on other players.
---
If you use a slur, you are someone who uses slurs in your vocabulary. 'But it was only once!' is bullshit. You're a bigot. Non-bigots don't use slurs, and they should've perma-banned you because you're a toxic bigot.
---
You know why you did it. You're just desperately telling everyone that you're too good to know why you did it.
---
Well you don’t seem like a bad guy honestly, you’re certainly more self aware than most people. 
---
I PvP myself into platinum every couple of seasons and I simply never use chat unless it’s to communicate something to my team. Instead if I get annoyed or whatever I just swear IRL and instead of a GM banning me my girlfriend tells me to shut up.
---
They also should have stuck with the GW1 PVE model as it was far superior to what we have now IMO.
---
I am sorry but that is bs. You broke the rules and you did it bya far. 
---
It was a choice you made and when ever such choices goes bad you dont blame a bad day, bad players or anything else, you man up to it and take the punnishment and next time you enter the same situation you remember that it is not ok and let it go. That is how it works.
---
Only in a few cases you will play a healer just to got someone who heals your party. It's always about boons and buffs. And the firebrigade (firebrand+renegade) combo offers a lot of this.
---
In fractals you will mostly find grps with a firebrand healer because he offers a lot more heals and support than a renegade healer.
---
You can also play a renegade healer and firebrand as condi or Power quickbrand because a dps oriented firebrand support does more dps than a dps oriented renegade support.
---
But if you can play your healbrand you can keep your party alive much easier than someone playing with a heal renegade maybe that's the reason most grps prefer a healbrand. 
---
For raids you wanna mainly focus on druid because he can spread 25 might on 10 ppl and some nice offensive buffs.
---
But there are also other class combos with which you can reach all the boons you need while don't losing total dps. But this is the main reason pugs and most guilds play druid. 
---
Today it's not uncommon to play a healbrand, alacrigade healer, tempest healer, scourge healer or even boon thief healer (only on few bosses because of stolen skill detonate plasma).
---
Heal tempest and heal scourge don't offer as much boons and buffs as the firebrand or renegade, But their heals are very decent (tempest is probably one of the best healers in the game). And scourge got the nice class mechanic of offering sand barrier and porting downed players towards you while healing them for a small amount.
---
That and multiplayer "Carrier" mount to carry around a friend trying the game without leaving them behind, and players with no mounts in WvW.  
---
Everything else could be just masteries, and since each mount has just 3-4 mastery tracks and only 3 of them use the second mount ability key, and masteries can have up to 6 so far, there's still room for them to grow.
---
There could even be a skimmer mastery that allows it to dive underwater by pressing the "swim down" key while at the surface, collect water as a secondary bar while diving (like the skyscale fly bar), then use the stored water for a superspeed boost with the second mount ability key both underwater and on the surface. 
---
Oh. And a "Crawler" mount that can walk on walls and ceilings.   
---
Skyscale can climb walls, but there's a limit on how high it can go since you eventually reach a point at which the endurance gain while the fly bar is all brown is too small to keep gaining height.    
---
A Crawler mount would be different in which it can keep going up the wall, but it would have the downside that the wall would need to have a special surface that allows the crawling, like vines, tree bark, cobwebs, etc. The textures would be unique to these and easily identifiable.    
---
Crawlers would also be the smallest mount, with a collision smaller than the jackal, and they would fit in holes and gaps no other mounts can.  
---
And since they can also walk on ceilings, it'll be able to get to places no other mounts can, not even the skyscale, like a small hole on the ceiling at the other side of a chasm with walls that are slippery for skyscales, but with a crawling path on the ceiling.  
---
As for the appearance, it could be something like a gecko with sticky pads, or a spider.
---
Hi, advertising your stream isn't allowed on this sub as per rule #6
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
gl tho
---
What awful treetment.
---
WC cata spot is on the cliff along the wall. You can LOS most mortars while hitting the walls with splash damage. Cata bubbles suffice to cata down WC.
---
Assuming you have SM cataing WC is fairly easy.
---
You should watch skilled rev players stream their gameplay, no edited footage. First that comes to mind is Tramadex, he doesn't stream much these days but there are a couple of VoDs up on his twitch channel as of this moment (8+ hours) and he's also streaming right now.
---
I raids, a lot of people still want a singular  druid for spirits. Off healers are pretty much as diverse as possible. its extremely common to see heal scourges, heal tempests, heal firebrands, etc.  
---
That said, theres been a big shift towards quickness firebrands and alacrity renegades, both heal and dps variants.
---
On the Fractal side of things its completely shifted to firebrand/renegade. Seeing a boon chrono and druid in a fractal group is extremely rare now.
---
whether it eats up man hours or not is irrelevant. it's their job to make sure that innocent players are not caught up in this bullshit, if they are, it should be their top priority to make sure that *only* guilty players are punished and that innocent players are compensated in full.
---
Yes. There's an item called a portal scroll for each map. There's also a tome to store them all in one inventory slot.
---
Same and especially with all the PoE 2 bombshell announcements I've been having a blast knowing the game has a great future ahead
---
I see she is showing a little ~~leg~~ stump down there...
---
You can buy ingame a book for Every lws, on every map on lws you can buy a teleport roll to this map. The roll is inside the book. I have the book inside the colective bagplace.
---
The side projects got shut down.
---
So they sacrificed GW2 for literally nothing
---
Yep. Closest to spawn meaning fastest back in the fight. Fair about lord and water gate though.
---
Sorry but this is low effort crap to try to make it seem like someone is still working on the game. It's obvious no one is.
---
Or, I don't know, rework the paths people don't take and create some meta reward for completing paths not taken, or one path in 3 different dungeons or 2x2 pairs of paths. 
---
One of the most fun things I used to do with my guild was 3-person paths through dungeons like Arah. Where is my increased reward for that? (aside from it being super fun with friends?)
---
Definitely would've been a whole new level of disappointment.
---
I used to wish I had chosen the Blood Legion at the start since it does feel the most "canon" origin for Charr Commanders. After this episode it felt like I dodged a bullet
---
Perhaps :p
---
Definitely. And the lesser evil they find on return is Saruman and the Scouring of the Shire. A wonderful comparison to what's going on here.
---
Gw2 becoming dull and trivial isnt really due to capitalism. Its not even a succesful investment for ncsoft atm.
---
Capitalism doesn't limit devs to producing broad, easy and dull content only.
---
When people say content is dead, they usually mean people don't play it. That's the implication. Abandoned content is not the same as dead content. If people aren't going to be more specific clarification does help.
---
Anyway I've lost track of the number of times someone said dungeons are dead meaning not run anymore.
---

I'm sure there's a coding reason why some stuff that "seems so simple" hasn't or won't be done.  It's happened to me at work where someone asks for a minor addition and I know it'll take me weeks to implement.  But I figure if we throw the idea into the mists maybe it'll get into a to do queue.
---
I hear ya.  Bought the game in Feb 2018 and played it exclusively until about a month or so ago.  Logged 3571hrs according to GW2 efficiency, and had a blast. The only real $$ I spent was on the initial expansions and a few account upgrades afterwards, every Gem purchase done afterwards was with in game gold, so I more than got my money's worth.
---
Thing is, it isn't just that I'm bored with the game, but that ANET is making design decisions that, at least to me, make this game progressively worse.
---
Scourge needed balancing, but the mechanic change they instituted killed the elite in PvE for me.  Every decision or planned decision they have mentioned since then has hit the wrong chord with me.
---
2 years since Alliances were announced but their Q1 Focus for WvW will be the Warclaw, and the addition of yet another Mastery for it?  
---
Strike Missions added to the game, but it seems like no new raids or fractals or forthcoming, so not really an addition.
---
Wrong wrong and wrong, at least for me.  There are plenty of folks who still enjoy the game and like these changes, and more power to them - I hope they continue to enjoy GW2 and all the comes afterwards - but for me, it was time to move one.
---
What ultimately sucks is I went almost 2 full years without having to buy a new game, and now it's getting expensive as I start adding stuff to my Steam library =(
---
Traditional slovenian recipe..
---
3:2:1 = 3flower, 2 butter, 1 sugar and 1 egg per 1kg of flower. 
---
Example : 600g flower, 300g butter, 150g powdered sugar
---
Put buttter and sugar together, make sure its mixed together well into buttery paste (do everything with hands).
---
Add flower and 1 egg. You can also add a bit of orange peel or vanilla sugar for aroma.
---
Now mix everything together with your hands amd you have the best cookie dough.
---
Pro tip: It might seem a bit dry at first when youre making your dough but dont worry. Its normal. Just keep at it, dont add anything to it. It will become good after a while.
---
After the dough is done, put it in a cold place for 10 min so its easier to work with it after.
---
You can do anything really, roll it, cut cookies (different kind), glaze them, you can also make pie with this dough.
---
Its easy and quick. Enjoy!
---
Rewards are the least important part. They should always be used as a carrot to promote desired behavior rather than trying to make them thr main driver behind gameplay.
---
No matter how good your rewards, without good / fun gameplay the game will not last.
---
You can use elo and higher difficulty levels in mmorpgs too. Gw2 just decided to make everything so easy its braindead. 
---
As a result most rewards also lost meaning. It's a grind that you can bypass with $$$ more than a reward that means something.
---
You can teleport in, bitterfrost you can just walk into from the map to the south
---
The completionist in me cries when they're repeatable and never show as "finished"
---
Can we please make it so that build loadouts are not... uh... basically can we just redo them so they don't suck?
---
From what I saw in pugs groups, if you're doing the job right nobody is complaining. The popularity goes: firebrand (often along with its renegade counterpart), healing druid, healing scourge (tho, condi in capable hands can be the additional safe support for any healer, due to sand shade barriers spam), occasionally someone swaps to tempest if party needs heals but nobody got the dedicated healer, healing scrapper seems to be most exotic - it's visible more in dps-tankish-supportive variant due to bulwark gyro F2 bubble and slot skill that acts like sponge-barrier
---
Not really. Gw2 has been giving top tier rewards to mostly trivial pve content. Personally I dont find this worth playing at all. Gameplay too bad to bother.
---
But the effect of these farms on all prices and economy is noticable. It literally makes rewards everywhere else bad over time.
---
So we have gameplay getting worse and worse AND rewards getting worse.
---
I dont think reminding people not to play content they dont enjoy just for the rewards is bad. Many brainless skrit out there.

If you dont like repetition without being rewarded for it... why would you do it if you do get rewards? Do the rewards make it fun? 
---
Does getting gold or shinies make something fun?
---
It used to be against the ToI, but simply creating a double-click macro isn't something that was regularly cracked down upon.  More recently they said they aren't going to punish people for making macros to do double-clicks, or even macros that automate dodge-jumps, so you should be safe.
---
With that said, even with a macro the achievement is likely going to take forever using tonics.  Why not just use the normal drinks and Consume All to speed things up?
---
"at your own risk" is far from "guilty". what they are doing is shifting the onus onto the player because they don't want to do their jobs properly. it's understandable if you get *scammed* by mail trading, but if the mail trade was successful and you lose your item because someone traded real money for that item somewhere in its history and anet just take it away from you without compensating you, despite you doing nothing wrong, that is pretty scummy and a showcase of how incompetent they are.
---
At a certain age, you get several in each Birthday Gift you open, so that's why you have a lot.
---
I had this exact same problem coming from ESO. My hand kept cramping up having to hold RMB all the time.
---
Set up a hotkey to turn it on and off when you need to actually mouse over things for info. :)
---
It's not about fun, its about things not having a purpose. I can have fun doing purposeless things, but they'd be alot better and more fun with a purpose.
---
Hmm good point. All my character slots have 80's from years ago. I need to go through and log into each one haha.
---
I got around that by picking the karma boost as a level up reward when i would do keyfarms up to lvl 60.  That way i don't have to worry about someone putting down a bonfire
---
I agree with the discussion.  
---
You sound remorseful which is refreshing but I can't help to think it was just cause you wanted lesser time on your ban and don't really understand how toxic you really are.   
---
Here's the thing, you make assumptions about players gender, "especially trolly" players and reserve this right of yours to be just as "trolly" as them .  You let this anger build in you which is imo more of the problem not what you said. Three separate incidents, while I don't know how far they were apart I don't think it matters.  See you could have reported them if you felt like they were such violations but really yours  were the only violations going on.  You seemed wound pretty tight.  It sounds like you need a little break and they gave you one.
---
For the future just do yourself a favor log off, grab a snack, take a walk, think of the things that make you happy.  Or if inclined and feel like you are being grieved you can report them.
---
The purpose of videogames is to have fun. Not to roleplay as a skrit to acquire temporarily visual shinies.
---
Rewards are a nice extra, but always an extra. If you play for the rewards in and of themselves it's a matter of time before you wonder what the fuck you're actually doing.
---
Yes I'm saying most people dont fall for gacha as such. Sorry rp'ing as skrit is a minority.
---
I trade 37 tomes of knowledge for Karma boosters.
---
Not only the chests flgive u karma. And u only get 3 chests per game mode. If u wanna farm all day  the trinket, that costs a little bit if u dont have any ascender amulet, get useless just for 10% in a couple of chests.
---
Maybe I'm dumb, but I'm wondering the same thing. How did this come to be? I mean I get that it's exceeding rare, but how does an item's worth go above the TP limit? 10,000 gold is a bit of arbitrary number sure but so is 20,000 gold. Why is it that it's specifically worth around 20,000 gold? Did word get out that some random guy was able to trade it for 20,000 gold worth of items for it and from then on everyone who isn't a complete "noob" will sit on it not sell it at TP limit gold? So people hear of this trade then they perpetuate it with further successful trades by other people so suddenly it's forever worth 20,000 gold period, and the 10,000 gold limit becomes stupid and not okay anymore... I guess.
---
what percentage of players on gw2 do you think want to have a legendary weapon?
---
that same percentage is what you just called a minority
---
What build are you running now?
---
Good for you.
---
Thanks for proving all the whiners wrong about ANet not suspending players.
---
Does a roadmap not tell you what is coming up. Yes theres not a lot on it but its Q1 2020.
---
There are massive differences in ranged balance in PvE, hardcore PvE, PvP and WvW. 
---
In open world and up into early fractals, anything is viable.   
---
Above that, you should know what youre doing, which includes having a decent build.   
---
In PvE Meta, mostly used for High-End Fractals and Raids, ranged builds are somewhat rare. Rifle Deadeye f.e. is one of them.
---
ooooooooooooh you looking for good old build called pussymancer.

Someone who is active in map/teamchat, complaining about nobody helping them when they callout **LOTS at Fire Keep, need help fast** . Without giving the helpful details on approximate numbers (LOTS is both 5 and 50), colour or guild tag, where their siege is at and what they're doing.

Also complaining about getting kicked from squad for 'scouting'.

Look for WP's open world mesmer build, its extremely good for bosses

Flour will do the trick. Kinda like when you roll out dough, you flour the rolling pin so your dough doesn't stick so much.

You might want to use this time to reflect on how to carry yourself as a person, based on comments like this it seems you may have some room for growth: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/dfo02e/_/f35ke9w](https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/dfo02e/_/f35ke9w).

This has been exactly my impression since returning to this game a few weeks ago.
---
The new thing is him staying, I saw him a few times but he always disapeared when I got close to him
---
He's a big boy
---
I've never seen him before. I've seen the one that shows up during the meta but you can never get that close, he poofs just like the old anomalies did.
---
&gt; Excuse the potato setting

Never apologise for wanting to play at more than 12 FPS

[Oldschool RuneScape says hi](https://oldschool.runescape.com/)

I don't want to speak too soon, but this combination seems to actually be doing stuff. Will update later, but it actually seems to be downloading files, as the .dat file is actually increasing in size.
---
Thank you so much! I was having one hell of a week trying to figure this out.

Its that guy who stay during meta event. I get the same bug and he stay permanent in my screen

Call of duty and assassins creed says hello
---
Boon Chronomancer or Holosmith are your two best options for this setup, with the Chrono being far and away the more sought after class for end-game pve. Carry an offhand sword, focus, and pistol to cover your bases and you're golden.
---
Remember Dungeons?
---
Too many posts too read and your post is too long so I didn't read it either. But did you know that you can start the Download process and you can stop at any point and it will not restart when you start the launcher up again, it continues with the files that are left. (Or at least that's how it usually works, if it does restart then it might be a problem with your machine. Your hard drive might be on its way out) :)
---
league of legends says hello.
---
What's that, outside of AC these are all entirely multiplayer games. I admit CoD tries its hardest to make shooters and pvp as casual centric as possible; but at the end of the day they're still playing against other players. No matter how casual friendly they try to make it, the players die frequently and lose frequently.
---
Of course! So was I! Haha. Glad it helped :).
---
Awesome! How’s it going now?
---
Tigger? Is that you?
---
The ones you might be missing out on if you havent looked into them already are mesmer, necro and ele. 
---
Gs mirage has good long range dmg and control and can easily peel off attackers. It's burst however is strongest in melee (though its great mobility allows it to stay safe even when going in close)
---
Scourge is(was) notorious for its nasty amounts of dmg and its ability to melt through tanks as well. It is mostly medium range and heavily relies on your kitting skills to be effective.
---
Weaver is most common as a melee bruiser but there is a niche scepter burst build that some ppl enjoy. And given the fact that it can delete enemies from a fair distance it can be useful as well.
---
They have ?  Perhaps my game failed to patch the new raids and fractals
---
Veterancy doesn't exclude you from the ToS. If it's a day 1 vet, well then that sucks for them.
---
Yeah, not even close to what I said, you should read it again.
---
the point is that you literally cant. theres not a single one up on the tp because no ones stupid enough to sell it for less than half its value. anyone who wants to buy one HAS to go through an exchange.
---
Been playing the game for 7 years and finally killed my first Raid bosses last week. Making my first real push toward Legendaries now. I'm also getting a lot of my real life friends into the game, so I'm mentoring as well. The important thing is to have an objective and seek to achieve it. If you have LITERALLY done everything, take a break. But, if you still have something you haven't done or have been putting off, go for that.
---
You can walk into lake doric from DR
---
Someone else already said it, but for me endgame is improvement. I know/use meta builds on a wide variety of characters, but run around with a number of compromises and tweaks to solo explorable dungeon paths and the occasional soloable fractal, just for the challenge. As such, my performance in any particular role is compromised by the need to do everything for myself. Lately, I've been trying to focus just on reaching the performance benchmarks for raiding, as that's the last aspect of the game I  haven't touched yet.
---
As for the gold reward rate, eh. I never felt that my gameplay experience was either limited or vastly improved by having a ton of gold. It's convenient to have a nice pile on hand for gem conversions, but aside from that I'm fairly indifferent. I do have one final currency goal in GW2, which is to get to 5000g. That probably sounds big to the majority of GW2 players, but when it comes to people actually serious about gold in this game (I am not one of them), I gather that 5000 is a fairly modest number.
---
Oh shit youre right i miscalculated. Its actually 450!
---
Everyone here is absolutely correct that ranger is the best choice.
---
But warrior sniper is the most hilarious! Killshot is the most satisfying ranged skill. Ever.
---
you have done a good job. I cosplay Eir and SWcarlet in game. It can be difficult to do!
---
That moment when you said you had one job
---
Is this really working? What problem you had before you did this? Lagg issues?
---
&gt; ... Followed by a completely untested idea that is probably not safe-proof, let alone subject to tons of drawbacks and other issues. I’m not saying your idea is dumb though but it you’re to criticize a design concept, the last thing you should do is to reply with another design concept that sounds good on paper but is completely untested lol. 
---
How is it untested? It's pretty much what they have been doing since LW1's mode was scrapped lol. New maps, locked in time.
---
My take is that instead of changing an old map (LW1) or making a brand new map (LW2-4), you make a new map copying an old map. Just imagine we could still play Battle for Lion's Arch, accessed through a portal. There it is, pretty easy.
---
This model lets you represent different stages of a war in the same areas. Right now, you can't do that. This model would let you see Malchor's Leap cleansed and restored, the centaur war progress through different stages across Kryta, or even "journeys in time" where you can visit existing zones in the ancient past (for whatever reason). How about a huge invasion of an existing zone? Can't do that now, it would suck and have no impact (like Scarlet or awakened invasions, which feel completely out of place). If you duplicated the instance, you could destroy the whole zone and don't worry about the original experience being lost.
---
The rest of the problems are not related to how timelines and lore work in the existing maps. Those are reward and business model problems. New maps aren't bad, empty new maps with nothing to do are.
---
Then fix flipping, not the mount. One player contesting an area with 50+ players is the problem, not the mount. You can already do that without a mount. Set up 10 people, send them one by one. By the time the 10th goes the 1st should already be in place.
---
Snowballing .. how exactly that works? The squads I've been in, when they wipe, even if not entirely, retreat and wait for the whole group to re-join.
---
About the fighting part .. I'm not too experienced with tactics yet so I wont say much. Either way, I have yet to participate in a blob fight where teams initiate with the mount. No boons pre-stacking insta looses you a fight, so the moment you engage on the enemy you have to be prepared. Setting up scourge marks, getting heals ready, spamming low stab, pop enemy marks, stop enemies from engaging you by putting pressure on choke points .. I believe all these tactics haven't changed with Warclaw.
---
I agree with removing the engage ability, and reduce endurance to 2, but making it unfun to use, just remove it.
---
It's really working. So far it has helped 3 other people besides myself (including an IRL friend)! The issue was that the launcher would stall when downloading the game. Usually right at 35%. After that it would continue to say it is downloading (with the amount downloaded increasing) but the files remaining would never move and it wouldn't actually download anything. This is happening from packet loss from the QoS Packet Scheduler not prioritizing packets properly (lotta p's there lel). It's a known issue in the Networking community apparently and everyone I have seen talk about it says to just keep it off because it is a bad feature of Windows.
---
So you conceade the point that the Ascended armor is not only meh looking, a pain in the dick to get, and over all the rewards in WvW are just ok at best if not trash. 
---
Also while roaming balance is hot trash, zerg is arguably just as bad. Anet keeps over kitting classes to deal with others instead of attacking the root of the problem in the first place which is the over powered class.  Right now zerg fights boil down to who has the most FB's and Scourges. How in the hell is that fun?
---
Let me just bring up the past zerg fighting. In the past zergs were able to dive into each other and fight. So Anet changed the way stab worked. Thats when the BOON meta happened. To fight that Anet made classes into boon stripping and corruption. Then Condis took way off thanks to their heavy handed balancing. Now Scrapper and FB have massive condi cleansing pushed into their kits to help stop this. Thus we have zergs who just push through each other over and over dropping wells hoping to win.
---
I don't think it's malicious but I agree, the TP cap should be raised.
---
Enjoy the Karma boosters!  Downside though is clicking through all the other level up rewards
---
Not very likely. The cases where it happened were when someone tried to sell something for way more than its TP value. And only if the person that ends buying it is an RMT gold seller.  
---
Basically, don't try to sell things for 10x the tp value and you will be fine.
---
It gets bugged very often and usually only works when
---
 a) Servers reset for a patch 
---
b) Desert Highlands has a large population of players and an additional instance (nonbugged one) is created to accomodate the players. This does not happen very often anymore.
---
The biggest problem is that this guy is required for a couple achievements.
---
&gt;im asking people what their drive to keep playing is and how they feel about there almost being no reward to your grind, in comparison to other games.
---
This is probably the biggest reason people leave the game. I used to do dailies and care about ap, but then they felt like a chore like you said and I stopped doing them. Then I eventually only logged in for new stuff and my playtime for each episode since "a star to guide us" has drastically gone down and down.
---
I started playing Destiny 2 and it was really refreshing needing to actually work towards meaningful goals that usually lead to new weapons that totally change the game because it is a first person shooter. And there were constantly new toys to play with every couple weeks. Anet has just painted themselves into a corner with the lack of any progression or new skills or anything each episode. If they came out with a new elite specialization each episode then there would be like a new game every couple months with new skills, weapons, and a different class. I really hope Visions of the Past is a turning point in that regard if its like the GW1 bonus missions where it actually feels new rather than logging in with the same characters and the same skills I've been using for the past few years.
---
Like you said, the rewards for time are mediocre mostly just being some gold or materials which is mostly pointless and it just feels like Anet doesn't actually want you to log in every day and play. Sure there is a ton of content but when you reach the point like you have it just feels like Anet only wants to bother logging in for a couple hours each month for something new.
---
TL;DR - you've reached the point in the game where it feels pointless to log in for anything other than new content so go play something else until that happens.
---
Make sure you add terrible voice acting.
---
Oh. In that case, if you want to fix that, we need to talk not about returning the gold/MCs to the YT video maker, but about increasing the item's drop rate to the point where the price drops below 10k.
---
&gt; So you conceade the point that the Ascended armor is not only meh looking, a pain in the dick to get, and over all the rewards in WvW are just ok at best if not trash. 
---
I don't concede anything you idiot
---
I'm talking about ascended gear in general back when anet first introduced it and plopped a new gear tier in our laps that was much harder to obtain than exotic gear, especially if you run more than one build on more than one character
---
That's when people started to care that their pvp mode wasn't dropping enough loot.
---
Video games are inherently time wasters, that is their purpose, to fill time.
---
Do you want the truth, or the answer you want to hear?
---
Because, strike missions, new planned and current masteries with their own category (and thus, not following any theme of previous masteries), and no doubt many other future planned things, to me, sound much more like something that would come from an expansion than a typical living story, looking back at previous ones. Plus, I think people fail to realize the amount of new content we've gotten in just 2 living story episodes. Its literally just begun, so be patient and Im sure more brand new content will flood in as it has been.
---
As long as they do not waste more development on instanced content I will be happy.  World boss trains/another world complete/achieves have kept me happy since early access.  Have needed no breaks nor played any other games.  This is the perfect game for my playstyle.
---
I would also (as an avid DIYer/maker) take a file, dremel, whatever and just file the cutter edges into something sharper. 3D printing as we'd like just isn't there yet, but it IS a good base for applying just a little more DIY know-how. You've gotten a lot of great baking advice for keeping the dough from fluffing/bloating the shape out already. :)  
---
This is such a cool project and I have enjoyed following it.
---
it could be, which is why it should be thoroughly investigated like all potential rule breaking. in situations where someone is scammed and lose their items because they were too naive, it is completely understandable that anet cannot do anything, but in situations where everything was fine and dandy until anet came along and decided that someone who did nothing wrong should be punished for receiving an item which had RMT in its history (which is not actually restricted to mail trading, items have been bought with RMT on the TP in the past and it has also caused problems for the seller) a resolution should be reached in which the innocent parties are compensated and the guilty players are punished. you're comparing apples and oranges here - the arcdps situation is different than unknowingly buying something that has been bought / sold for RMT in the past, there is no way that you can know something you buy or sell, even on the tp, hasn't been involved in RMT (or wont be if you are the one selling it) until it's too late and you get screwed by anet. the drama is there, whether you want to deny it's an issue or not, it's an issue and it needs to be resolved. i am surprised that they let it go this long without doing anything or showing any sign of a plan to do something.
---
I say go for it. Or join any looking for more who want a second healer
---
just saying, you can get 100k karma in 1 hour @ dragonfall w/o doing any event.
---
The entrance for doric is blocked unless you've done to story on that character, bitterfrost is open for any character on your account
---
The daily karma for doing the bell choir 3x the race 3x and the jp 3x is also affected by all the boosters you put on for the orphans, so I've been doing those straight after. You can get 11 - 12k per. That's an extra 100k thereabouts
---
I was really hoping this would work for me. Unfortunately, mine still says its downloading files, but the files remaining or completion percentage still doesn't change. I'm stuck around 257,000 files left. Hopefully this gets fixed soon! I've never had trouble like this before with any other game.

The standard raid build on snow crows or metabattle should be good, you're constantly dodging as well as having evades on skills:

I'm running GW2 on a 2012 rMBP with discrete graphics and it does a decent job, usually in the 24-30FPS range. I keep the graphics pretty low, to get these frame rates.
---
The client does seem to crash sometimes during festivals and the like, but otherwise it plays pretty well.  I no longer run via bootcamp but I believe it would give you a bit of a boost, though not as much as in years past when the mac didn't have a native client.

I use my mac for light duty GW2 tasks (farming, etc) and switch to my gaming PC for WvW and the like.

It's free and has an absurd amount of content for someone starting out now. It's something of a learning curve for newbies and heavily relies on the wiki but if you can get your head around it then it's a great game.

Basically Diablo 3 - you can play vast majority of it alone, you're still forced to be online, any and all mods that threaten monetization are quickly killed, game has RMAH elements (literally buying game's main currency for $$$), and is balanced around that fact. At least in D3 you can farm food looking stuff directly - in GW2 the endgame is in gem store.
---
How am I not allowed to ask about the freaking game like this? Guess that answers my question.. bb
---
As a workaround until/if something like this becomes a thing, maybe you could reskin the Lava Skull back item to one of the basic backpack straps? That way it's always shown, but not showing up on the character.
---
Unless there are some cases you actually do like playing with it revealed. Sorry, just a suggestion for the time being, I like the idea of templates remembering what we have hidden for fashion wars builds too!
---
lol
---
I agree. It isn’t a priority because some of us have already played it, and it wouldn’t bring in money.
---
I could see it as being pushed out with a big release, but I hope it’s not a release on its own.
---
No but the PvP element does prevent trivializing content to the point that it's almost impossible to fail. PvP still punishes mistakes, even if there is a low barrier to success.
---
My server, Baruch Bay [ES], one of EU's largest, was literally dead for years on particular hours. There's more people and more action since the warclaw was introduced. I get mounts might be cancer for GvG purists, but it's undeniable things got generally better thanks to it.
---
For classes that stay strictly at a distance, deadeyes are one of the 2 classes in the game that absolutely needs to maintain distance, though some people run d/d as their second set for the meme kill. They're also one of the few classes that can go through blocks and reflects. Otherwise, they're one of the least-liked classes in the game by anyone not playing them as their kit is unintuitive to fight against. 
---
Base Engi is also basically a ranged class (with grenade kit and rifle) but they're completely eclipsed by Holosmith and Scrapper. 
---
Dragon hunter is not very good and they really only do one thing decently (surviving). Not to mention, the Lb is not a well-balanced weapon nor a very fast weapon; you'll be seeing dragon hunter mostly played as a close-ranged and melee class that sits on a node and stays alive but not win fights. Rifle Warrior is on the opposite side of this. While they need to maintain distance to do most of their damage, they're almost entirely reliant on burst moments. Otherwise, very poor survivability and tricky to play. You tend to not see either DH nor rifle warriors very often because DH isn't all that useful and rifle warrior's drawbacks outweigh the benefits.  
---
LB/GS Ranger is probably your best bet for a meta class though they don't stay a distance necessarily. While the LB has some of the best burst options in the game from long distances, the melee GS is also pretty overloaded with ridiculous burst. This in conjunction with the fact that sic' em is pretty ridiculous, LB/GS ranger is the most worthwhile choice among the possibilities. Also, they're one of the few classes that can go through reflects and blocks. Most fights will go like this: blow all of your Long bow long-distance burst + Sic' Em and whatever ever buff you have on to get their dodges -&gt; go into melee with smokescale's smoke assault + GS to do as much damage as possible after they have no more sustain. In a way, you can see the LongBow as mostly just a method to force enemy sustain out before you go into melee for the real damage and this trend is basically the same for the rest of the "ranged" classes in the game   
---
Scourge got nerfed into the ground so it's no longer the same (nor was it really a ranged dps class before). Base Necromancer isn't really a ranged class. Their ranged moments are mostly to setup their melee dps moments
---
Condi Mirage might be something you want to look into as it's one of the strongest classes in the game with their scepter/pistol and Staff but its not so much a ranged class as it is a "throwing projectiles at you from every direction" class. Power mirage is also something to look into and they function similarly to LB/GS ranger, that is with some ranged capabilities and a lot of upfront burst.
---
I can't speak for EU, but in NA various metas that are worthwhile get done.  There's always people doing Casino Blitz each two hours, with overflows that can't get into it forming as people try to arrive late (often after Matriarch in VB).  Forged With Fire and Junundu Rising are every hour rather than every two hours, and neither requires a lot of players, so both are popular as well.  The alternates for their zones, Serpent's Ire and Maws of Torment, are less popular.  Serpent's Ire is quite long compared to Forged with Fire, while Maws of Torment has buggy NPC pathing that can cause the event to fail.
---
Dragonfall should always be seeing play.  Palawadan is more hit and miss, it's still rewarding but lots of people overfarmed it when it was way too rewarding (and had no daily cooldown), and so reduced rewards plus burnout leave it sometimes undone.  Death-Branded Shatterer gets fought for people to try to get the infusion it drops.
---
I've never seen that over here. Where do they post up in LFGs usually?
---
Edit: I just found one by checking every LS4 LFG categories. I guess they repost every time they switch maps. A+ advice, thanks man.
---
Many bad guys are being set aflame. I greatly appreciate your help.
---
This, I imagine this is exactly what the plan is.
---
No problem!  Yeah, you gotta kinda go through a bunch of them to find it sometimes.  If you get through several tabs then usually it just means nobody is running one.  Its great gold though.  Guys on NA are still fine tuning it but its roughly 39g/hr right now.
---
I disagree 100%.
---
What have they done that they need to do good will towards?
---
People have paid for 2 Xpacs and gotten them.
---
It was a system not designed to be repeatable, it wasn't sold as that. Infact it was free - and *now* people are asking for it to be "brought-forward"
---
They can do that, but there is no monetary motivation for them to do so. Its going to take time, and maybe a Dev working on their own (which we should 100% not expect)
---
They are a company and you should treat them as such. Don't expect good will.
---
I do apologize if I seem pointed, I do not mean to be. I don't understand the expectation that Anet is going to rush to add it though.
---
I've been playing Destiny 2 to satisfy my solo online grinding cravings for the past 4 months
---
It's wintersday, so a lot of people are doing that right now.
---
True, but GW's model was based on buying expansions to play, so it fits. GW2's expansions to the game are a mean to make people play and use the cash shop.
---
Thanks for the fix!  I finally was able to download the full game. Much appreciated my friend!
---
Winterberry route on multiple characters in Bitterfrost is still probably the fastest way. I assume you have an amulet already, but  if you don't, then the one that you purchase for eternal ice shards once you complete the hunger collection is the fastest and easiest way to get a stat selectable amulet.
---
I think S1 is really a rose-tinted glasses situation.
---
It would get them goodwill to bring it back as a replayable season, but people are conflating the *gameplay* highlights with the narrative and maybe even some of season 2, and if the season came back, a lot of people would probably be underwhelmed.
---
Scarlet was not an interesting character, and the story of S1 was not nearly as good as the seasons that followed it, or the expansions.
---
IMO the best thing to do, if they want to bring some of it back, is to *rework the iconic encounters into an introductory raid wing*.
---
Make a raid wing that is easier than most, and have that be a ramp to end-game PvE content. Throw it in the aerodrome as a sort of "simulation chamber", or make it part of the Scrying Pool as a flashback, and put a squad through the assault on Lion's Arch:
---
- Raid-balanced version of the Marionette (fewer platforms)
---
- Assault on Lion's Arch event encounter (vs. Watchwork Knights)
---
- Battle on the Breachmaker
---
That final arc from the Shiverpeaks into LA are really the main things missing for new players. A lot of the rest is covered in the recap and in fractals.
---
Me too...  me too... Only one of my characters has ever progressed beyond the personal story missions in Lion's Arch.  You can't visit everywhere, but you still get at least some access to Old LA.
---
Doesn't the Mordremoth fight have condition immunity for a chunk of it (or was that nerfed out)
---
I think weaver sims the highest of all classes on training dummy.
---
I have everything except accesoires. The berries will take another 6-7 days before I have the 2nd since I only play 1 character.
---
It’s a second gear set for a condi Weaver build I’m creating.
---
Besides Winterberries, your options are Ember Bay (150 Petrified Wood), Sandswept Isles (150 Difluorite) and Dragonfall (150 Mistborn Motes).  Dragonfall should be the fastest of those three zones assuming you're starting from scratch, but if you already have enough of the other currencies, you can go get one right away.
---
If you play World vs. World, you can also get one for 175 Skirmish Claim Tickets and 250 Memories of Battle.  And if you raid, Magnetite Shards and Gold can also be exchanged for one.
---
With that all said, if we're assuming that you don't have enough Laurels/Guild Commendations, the absolute fastest way will likely be to join a guild and participate in a set of Guild Missions.  A full set of missions completed will give you 12+ Guild Commendations, enough to buy an accessory.
---
Okay - how about mistborn motes (dragonfall)? You can convert eternal ice shards into those to make it go by faster.
---
Can I skip to Icebrood on my thief alt? ( He hasn’t playd LS3-4 yet). And do all the story rewards on him as well?
---
A ray of hope. Hold on to it!
---
I've had no trouble finding groups for any metas, holiday seasons aren't a great representation of the game unfortunately :(
---
Yes! You can just go into the story journal and begin it whenever. Or alternatively for a bit of karma purchase [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bjora_Marches_Portal_Scroll) on your main and put it in a shared inv slot/move it to alts.
---
Actually it just removes those as a possibility while in WvW which I like. It increases chance of an XP/item boost. I always go to WvW EotM to do my gobbling no matter what activity I’m boosting for.
---
Close. Nose tip is too high on yours though. Also, her mouth curves up slightly on the sides where yours curves downwards. Otherwise, super close.
---
Should be fast enough then. I already got some mots from when I did dragonfall months ago. Should be able to get to 150 in half a day or so, and I need like 70 berries for the other accessory.
---
He could always make Risen bloater cookies....
---
Sounds like you're set! Glad I could be of assistance. Another thing to note is that you can do the Bjora strike mission once per day for additional shards as well.
---
Yep! Thanks a lot!
---
And oh yeah there are strike missions now. I used to solo stuff like Arah, are these soloable or do they have mandatory group mechanics?
---
I’ve heared they are super easy but maybe solo they are a challenge?
---
&gt; like kitey archers or hard hitting but vulnerable artillery type builds
---
Longbow ranger it is.
---
Could also try deadeye but it's waaaay hard to pull off.
---
In EU you can add Jolie Guardian to your friend list, He/She runs meta train almost daily starting around 10am CET, just /sqjoin to see if the squad is up, don't bother the person with questions.
---
Why relive a story we've already seen? I'd rather see events between GW1 and GW2. Kind of what I hoped they'd do with fractals after Twilight Oasis.
---
oh it's the exact same case posted again ?
---
Show her on YouTube, No reason to sell old Content as new one
---
&gt;So ya people were always concerned about the rewards then and now
---
No they really weren't but since you won't stop banging on the armor in the mode I'm going to assume you just weren't around back then or are actually an idiot
---
Isn't Chrono a power dps class now?
---
the name of the youtuber and the original poster are pretty much the same and i doubt this is a common issue, so i would assume so. i think the person who posted the current thread is unrelated to the youtuber / OP but is concerned about this happening again in the future, especially given the response of anet.

I feel the need to ask you to correct your statement as it is quite erroneous. A single druid can bring all the utility that a druid can provide and literally every other healer brings some utility that the druid can't bring.
---
No boons? Do you want Phyrexians? Because this is how you get Phyrexians!
---
This is the way.
