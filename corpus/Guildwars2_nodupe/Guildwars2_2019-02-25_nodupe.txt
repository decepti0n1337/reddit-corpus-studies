Maybe it'd be easier to do that if they weren't constantly moving resources away from the project.
---
---
---
i feel attacked and vindicated at the same time.
---
Yeah, it needs more preparation time before starting.
---
I think we both know I'm not going to go back over 3 years of videos, so I suppose we're at an impasse.
---

---
However, I have watched some of your content and in particular those episodes of teatime on which you appear. And I certainly got the impression that you were advocating in favour of the living story (I wouldn't have said frontrunner, so if I gave that impression I apologise). You say yourself in the clip "I've been advocating for this game for the longest time" and in your playthroughs you have definitely appeared enthusiastic about the direction the story has headed. To flip from that to such a strong negative reaction seems inconsistent.
---
I have played all 3 modes a lot as well. Started with wvw though, after some time I played more and more pvp as wvw got stale and boring. Its just a bit over 2 years that I started to play more pve. The reason for that is that wvw/pvp even together just weren't enough anymore. It wasn't really deliberate, I would prefer to stay at wvw and pvp, but I just can't. Without raiding I would have quit the game long ago, fractals are dead in our guild for a year or so. I'm happy that I have to take a 1 month break currently.
---
While there are always people flaming new players in any game mode or making fun of them (did my own fair share here), I must say some people are apparantly terrible in their abilities to learn stuff. If I see new players in wvw asking questions he usually gets good and helpful answers. Remember, pve players can get very emotional about simple things, like breakbars, as well...
---
I get the feeling some people complain about not getting helped in wvw, meanwhile not actually having put a minimum of effort to sort it out themselves/asking/look up information available.
---
Last thing. Tbh people saying that pvp/wvw players should start to give constructive criticism instead of just complaining can, in all seriousness and polite manner, go fuck themselves. Does anyone really believe that wasn't done before a multitude of times? Like, really?! 
---
I got Dusk last week roaming around in wvw... Sadly as a wvw player only I'll never get the money to craft Twilight 
---
1) When you do a beetle race or any other adventure and you want to cancel it (cause you know it‘s gonna fail) you can click on the little x on the orange adventure UI on the right side. This will reset it immediatly. 
---
No need to finish the race or adventure or to port away to reset it.
---
2) To move faster on guardian, use your GS 3 but just before the animation finishes, do a weapon swap. You can smoothly continue walking that way instead of standing still for a sec when GS 3 animation ends. 
---
3) Fun fact: You can combine most tonics with other toys, such as balloons or kites. This leads to funny scenes such as a cow holding a balloon, I love that :D 
---
Dude.. don't ever tweet

Why?

THIS IS WHY

OOOooooohhh

xD
---
Didn't want to go too crazy on the thief tips since they are mostly for PvP / WvW (which I know is a minority of this community.
---
But since you've already gone mad with the tips anyway, here are some extras:
---
* The stolen skills throw gunk is an ethereal field. Not uncommon to see 20+ confusion stacks on nearby target if you can daggerstorm in it.
---
* The warrior's stolen skill on land, whirling axe, will reflect projectiles in addition to causing damage. Just be careful on using it against enemies with retaliation. 5 targets x 15 hits could cause as much as \~20k self inflicted damage.
---
* Don't turn down your in-game sound too much! Enemies in stealth will still make sounds.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Ah yeah, that makes much more sense. 
---
My comment feels quite useless now. 
---
Oldschool 4:3 in 2012.
---
That's good to know. I've already seen so many people claiming that the game is dying or already dead. Now it makes sense why. 
---
no unless you count the 1. instance one. I was talking about a video i already linked in the thread, a tutorial would be usefull though.
---
ITT: People who have no idea how companies work and what a project is + many armchair project managers and analysts
---
idk if it still works but you could gain infinite swiftness while using centaur rune + a tonic with a reverse skill on healing spot
---
Also take your time. The Core game is _HUGE_ Players forget that since they had 3 years to muck about before the first xpac.
---
I gotta say after seeing the clip, and seeing a lot of the discussion going on in this thread alone. I am really sad that this whole thing has had such a negative impact on the company, our community and the game as a whole.
---
Thanks for your YouTube raid videos. I can't raid right now due to an injury so other peoples pov  are the next best thing.
---
There are no new MMOs on the scale of GW2. The most recent comparable game, ESO, came out only a year and a half after GW2. The only other really notable mmo to come out since is black desert. WoW is much older. FFXIV is a couple years older or just one year younger depending on your view. LotRO, Rift, STO, SWTOR, etc are all older. 
---
The genre is being kept alive by updates and expansions. Anet needs to match their competition if they want gw2 to remain viable,
---
All classes can heal themselves (Usually with skill 6 or various traits and sometimes as a side effect of other skills). The only time there's a "Dedicated healer" is in raids and sometimes fractals.
---
and yet both those drugs are readily available in mass quantities in many markets.
---
Ok, thats a great 1080p gpu. So replace the ram cpu and motherboard with something more modern :)
---
1050ti an i5 8300hq and 2x8ddr4 2666mhz ram in my laptop gets 130fps in old world open content and 80fps in town on mostly max settings. Same perf i get on my amd 2700x build with a 1070ti at 2560x1600.
---
Just noticed his name after you mentioned it XD!
---
Love your screenshots! But, sadly, I don't like snowy or branded areas. And this map has them both... It's still pretty, but personally I just don't want to hang out there for too long. At this point I dread the moment when Anet will go for Norn/Jormag expansion lol
---
It sure is. And it's also a wonderful example of humanity's amazing skill of taking a good thing and turning it into a steaming pile of shit. 
---
Other examples include air travel and the internet
---
As a casual PvP player, I see PvP players as the rock'em'sock'em robots too, given that 2 or 3 people on both teams are bots every single match lately.
---
Yeah I can't believe it's so different, I was like, "Where the hell am I?!" 
---
Guild Wars 2: Art Show.
---
Wait, you wanted gameplay? *Sweats intensely*
---
And quest choices! Would you like to help poor helpless Dredge or take t3 SM? Choice is all that matters in RPG! 
---
Old Kessex Hills :I.
---
Lucky you! Grats!!
---
He looks so tired of dealing with the voices and their shit.
---
I am still in shock and sadness they remade LA the way they did. Old LA had such a nice charm and wibe to it. It even had the 2 best voice lines in the game: "pssst, want to buy some apples?" and "by Ogden's hammer, what savings!"
---
It was a lot of fun hanging out in LA, good times!
---
Hahaha so true hardcore how PvErs think of other PvErs it's accurate.
---
It's common knowledge that it's shit, issue is is that not enough people play the game mode for it to work if it did
---
Great detail, everyone should open the image in a new tab!
---
why does rank pvp take forever to find a match even during prime time 
---
Not mesmer because from what I understand it's a quite irritating class to level, and if there's one thing I absolutely hate doing in these games, it's leveling.  I'm an end-game type.  Why not warrior?  No reason really.  I'm generally a ranged player.  I'm not super fast on my feet(or fingers for that matter) so when it comes time for difficult boss mechanics, I perform much better(read: don't die much) as a ranged player.  Kind of sucks to have to admit that, but hey...  I'm just not an awesome player.
---
I did create a Ranger which I'm working with now.  Only done about one quest.  Feels alright.  Nothing is jumping out at me as amazing but it's like level 3 or something so...  I think I like the idea of being able to offer heals or DPS as well, and Ranger checks those boxes.  That is, of course, so long as I can respec and gearswap on the fly.

---
Are dyes craftable? If so, how?
---
Not at all. Using the wiki is a simple, straightforward process that's easily done. Why remain deliberately ignorant when you can inform yourself with readily available information?
---
It's usually better to buy the dyes if you want specific ones or the cheap lower rarity. That or just get [random dye drops](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unidentified_Dye) from map completion, fractals, WvW, etc. Like mentioned chefs can [craft random dyes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Chef#Dyes) and it's really [easy to level cooking](http://gw2crafts.net/cooking_karma.html) (can also select top 5 or no hearts).
---
I feel like people fail hard at GW2 mechanics because of the visual noise. A lot of the difficulty comes from AoE circles all over the place, and people fail because they didn't hit the dodge button fast enough. Another part of the difficulty comes from the need to have phases/tells called out (Which direction to face, when to move). I don't particularly find that kind of difficulty interesting, but that's just me.
---
I like that WoW calls that stuff out for you. Not only does it clear comms (you don't need people saying GREEN BLUE SOUTH WEST every 5 seconds), but the difficulty instead comes from layered mechanics and quick decision making rather than twitch reflexes (I pressed dodge too late/I didn't go to the Suuth cannon within 5 seconds.). And no, having a choice between "I dodged" and "I didn't dodge" isn't really a choice.
---
WoW raids are more complex. GW2 raids are more visceral. Different tastes.
---
I agree with this. When EoTM was popping I was enjoying it more than EB since it had better balanced population but the drag was always the long travel times moving around the map trying to rejoin the zerg. I can only imagine EB with a new Alliance system to address population issue but with mounts to speed up the ability to rejoin the group, will make WVW A LOT more fun to play long term. I like the concept of WvW for the large scale fights. The travel times make players take less risk in getting into fights like that, which lead to more boring structure flips and less zerg wars. Next they need to develop a better defense system for structures to make offensive attacks more fun and defensive holding more fun and rewarding. 
---
&gt;what the guy in front of me is doing.

---
I'd argue that gear is really important in GW2. Do a raid equipped with gear for optimal damage and then raid in Soldiers gear. You spend only 5 minutes downing the boss while you skip all the mechanics, or you spend 9 minutes watching as everyone dies.
---
wtf lol
---
I think it is safe to say, "No one knows."  Not even ArenaNet.  They just got done announcing layoffs.  While officially they have stated that they are committed to Guild Wars 2 future, no one knows what is planned or what will be accomplished.  My hope is that they have realized that they have abandoned Guild Wars 2 for too long and will put focus back into the game (notably, cleaning up loose ends like this). 
---
I guess you skiped the last Haloween events.
---
Also, for the first point, there are waypoints unlocked for each of the starting areas for every race. It may take a bit of looking, but it should have a little area that's in a bit more detail than others.
---
I absolutely love that game lowered the pitch of the recorded audio to fit the Norn height lol.
---
I don't think you have to type the name, they've always just been normal exotics for me (Are you sure you want to salvage this?). Just wiki anything named if you aren't sure whether it's a precursor or not.
---
I love this map, will continue to spend a lot of time there in months to come. 
---
 This seriously needs an addition of "raid only players" : D 
---
Say Hello to scourge "too OP" (shades, limits, cooldowns, corrupt on scepter). Say Hello to boon chronos (the initial nerfs anyway, when you could share as many stacks as you had). Firebrand books. So yeah. Tell me again how wvw/pvp is not not giving pve people nerfs at all...
---
Awesome!
---
I look at how so many gaming studios pay software engineers 50-70k (with Riot Games going higher at 80-120k, but they're also in LA, and California real estate is disgustingly high) and it's depressing how little game development pays for how much technical knowledge it requires and how hard it is to get into it.
---
[https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Your\_Mad\_King\_says](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Your_Mad_King_says)...
---
Viewership in twitch doesn't indicate game population even a little. This game just sucks to watch. Too much visual clutter/spam with skills, and much of the game is casual. Most of what you see on twitch tends to be competitive. This is a casual, not competive game.
---
For a long time, Farmville was one of the most popular games of all time, but there were very few people streaming it. lol
---
let me guess, you hacked and got caught?
---
I'm not saying they never change things for other game modes purposes, but rather that 85% of the games balance is driven by PvE and not other modes. Overall the game is primarily balanced around PvE. WvW and Pvp have a lot more to complain about than Pve when it comes to balance and it has more dire effects when there's balance issues in those modes.
---
[GW Utopia](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Guild_Wars_Utopia) was technically a "project" that NC cancelled too, until it got dismantled and the usable parts became EotN and the rest used as the basis for some GW2 thing. Sure, it's terrible that people are getting laid off, but as far as the "cancelled projects" go, the whole adultery analogy might be jumping a little.
---
Ideally they should always have split balanced.
---
Sadly, in a world where they don't, PvP/WvW should be balance priority. I don't see why a game mode which is based around co-operation where if someone overperforms due to class it is only wholly beneficial to your team should matter as much as 2 competitive modes which when classes overperform can ruin a whole opposing side's gameplay experience cheapening the whole game mode?
---
Perhaps you can see something I am missing, so feel free to enlighten me, because I am honestly baffled.
---
WvW need factions and a hub for each faction like SPvP has which factions fight for resources used to build up their faction's hub to become more fancy and effective to the gameplay.  The progression becomes a collective focused progression rather than individual but with individual rewards.
---
&gt; WvW: Power of the Mists. Removed back in June 2017 this was determined by your 'Worlds' Score and gave a small % stats to everyone outside of Raids to increase gathering and health, gold find etc. it was a small intensive to increase your score but was just plain removed. 
---
to be fair on them, this was removed because:
---
1. Most people didn't even know it existed.
---
2. Megaservers make it a bit weird because it's all mixed up in PvE now.
---
3. Would be redundant if/when they introduce alliances.
---
But can *you* kill someone who failed? No.
---
&gt; I'd argue that gear is really important in GW2...
---
Then you'd be wrong.
---
Gear only helps you optimize what you already know and can play with.
---
You can clear all the raids in full greens if you really wanted. Gear is the last thing you should be worrying about when it comes to raids.
---
*Meta.
---
Viability is different, and it is an important difference.
---
Necro has always been Viable, and dominates in all kinds of PvE content that isn't high end (even having opportunities there now).
---
ANET is to blame for many things, however, they are definitely not to blame for a community driven misconception that Necro should be kicked on site even though they provide safer more consistent DPS than meta classes unless you are above the curve of player skill.
---
Will look in to that. After I decompressed my files everything seems to be going more smoothly but I _have_ experienced the FPS spike after doing this. After restarting the game I haven't had it happen again in the last 4 straight hours of play time so, I'm hoping it's fully resolved, what ever it was that was the issue. 
---
There's also the issue that everything by initial design is made to be eventually abandoned, there is very few real repeatable content when compared to other MMOs and very few things that encourage you to revisit older maps without involving some sort of gold sink.
---
The desitions taken are self destructive; the reason why we're not getting more maps entirely based in metas is because they are unsustainable if many are introduced. You can't complete a meta based map in your own, so when the shinier ones come out the previous will become abandoned and ultimately impossible to do. I mean, just look at the mysery of Serpent's Ire... needed for some interesting collections, but people needs to come and post in Reddit when a certain guild will do it because else it's annoying to find people even attempting it.
---
GW2 has a lot of good ideas that seem to have never really fleshed out or well thought and just slapped on and implemented without much thought. Even the uber movility given by mounts breaks more things than what it can make, as in case a future expansion comes, it will have to be designed without mount movement in mind unless they want to screw players who don't own PoF.
---
This is cool knowledge that should never be acknowledged
---
What's wrong with changing your opinion on something? On my first play through of Kingdom Hearts 3 I thought it was absolutely incredible because I was so wrapped up in everything being thrown at me, but by the second play through I came to realize that all the options and side quests that I initially thought were spectacular lacked any sort of depth, so my opinion changed. This isn't uncommon. 
---
Do you know how many projects fail for one that actually gets published in the industry? This is completely normal and basically unavoidable the difference is that due to NCSoft stepping in, the layoffs and all the attention around it lead to players learning about the cancled project.
---
Whats gear treadmill btw?
---
No season 1 and 2 is when there was a competitive scene it fell apart after that.  You clearly dont play the game
---
Theres probably 5 people on the combined fractals/raids team and there's 1 person I believe for WvW and pvp
---
Uh huh u mean the subsequent seasons were harder after all the competitive scene evaporated.  Are you fucking retarded lol? Season 1 and 2 is the only time it mattered, everyone quit after that.
---
anyone know if you can trade gem for gold on guild wars 1? Really want to get gw1 and unlock fiery dragon sword for a gw2 toon&gt;\_&gt;
---
Completely agree
---
Well, today you learned ...
---
Fair, but that's only if you interrupt or otherwise don't use your auto chain.
---
As a game company you want to create a new Title after so many years, no matter how good your title is running, it wount run forever and even if it did branching out is a good idea. And funding this mainly with the resources you have that rely on your already sucessfull project is the usual way to go. If they wouldnt act this way GW2 would never have happend. We would still just have new GW1 campaigns and while a bunch of people would still love them, it probably would be a much smaller and much more nieche title if it was still alive in the first place.
---
I've heard that in Asian countries the work/life is so heavily sided towards work that they prefer pay to win games because they have little time to earn rewards in game. 
---
Have you tried other classes? I played a bit of mirage, and while people all say it's easy and just dodge to win, I still suck at it. It just doesn't feel right. Meanwhile I can top dps 90% of the time on guardian and holo.
---
Asura master race
---
So in sPvP you have all specs unlocked for all content you have so you have the elite specs there. You really shouldn't take characters below 80 into WvW anyways so just level your guardian (1-80 can be done in as little as 4 hrs, crafting can get you 7-10 levels, do events use exp boosters (+food/utility) if you have them, run events, kill yellow mobs, etc). 
---
For fractals just ascended trinkets (no armor or weapons) gets you to fractal 66+ (2 from back, 2 from accessory, 6 from rings = 90AR) getting your weapons gets you to fractal 76+. You can get ascended gear from fractals but even with 0 armor you should be able to do most/all of tier 3 just fine. Take a [look at this guide on gearing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character) for some better ideas on how and where to get gear. You're right, don't get diviner exotics, better to get ascended diviner or temp exotics of another stat (berserker/assassin really). Also instead of [hybrid chrono](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/hybrid-chronomancer) you could build for [power chrono](https://discretize.eu/builds/mesmer/power-chronomancer) until you have more gear and gold.
---
[Giver's](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Giver%27s) works as an alternate but since you have the expansions you can get minstrel on all stat gear like the stuff offered in the WvW reward tracks ([legacy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legacy_Armor_Reward_Track), [Triumphant](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Armor_Reward_Track), [Crystal Desert](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystal_Desert_Reward_Track)) or [stat swap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) other ascended drops you get. Worth mentioning that all the HoT and season 3 selectable gear mentioned in the gearing guide also has minstrel and is usually very easy to get.
---
Really though, I'd suggest doing some more PvE before trying to make the leap into WvW. Doing the zones (if not also the story) will help you get exp, mastery, gear, etc. The HPs in PoF are also all soloable unlike HoT where about 1/2 of them are hard fights. If you don't already have it season 3 (or at least just bitterfrost) is really nice for trinkets (and it has diviner stats).
---
My vote is get all 90, then, just to be the one who has. Then email Anet and ask them to revoke everyone else's "Been there, done that" titles. I'll miss it, but I'll understand.
---
.\_. I think my joke was either very bad or no one got it cuz of the downvote XD
---
I have never played a Renegade before so I can't really tell the visual difference ;n; Amazing character tho!
---
I agree. Although you will likely find a ton of enjoyment in the expansions if you love the core game this much, I would wait until you’ve started to get a little tired of the core game to give yourself yet another breath of fresh air.
---
i knew that, im asking if i can trade cash shop currency for in game currency so i can buy those minis for hom points without wasting time grinding
---
aww
---
awww
---
anybody know if the endless upgrade extractor contract can remove runes from ascended gear?
---
It’s all people who don’t have a clue what they’re talking about.
---
They look at the revenue and see a dip... it’s because it’s been a while since the last expansion. It’s typical, and all things considered it’s actually quite impressive for a 4th quarter with no recent expansion.
---
yes? That's entirely its function, to remove runes from gear
---
By that argument we simply shouldn't even expect any of these skills to work anywhere because while trying to movement speed tests I've found that even some of the flattest looking grounds are not entirely flat.
---
Thanks again for commissioning! Glad you like it, your character was challenging but super fun to draw 💕 
---
I say get the raptor mount through a level 80 character. Then start a new character from 1 - 80 to experience it.
---
I got from 1-80 without getting the raptor first and deeply regret it :&gt;
---
season 1and 2 had the esport seasons running at the same time. They were two different things. Have there been more people tryharding than nowadays? Absolutely. But at the same time you could queue as a full premade, your rank was safelocked and meta was the most boring one ever. It was so insanely easy to reach legend, which is a reason so many people left after the dissapointment and why the whole system was changed again. 
---
Get a friend to play with you. Any game is fun with friends, even the bad ones.
---
I dunno, if the projects actually succeeded instead of blowing up in their faces that might be an actual good point. But, you know, both of their not-gw2 projects are getting canned and ncsoft is bringing down the hammer. 
---
Still waiting for a Sylvan Hound jackal. It's going to happen. Eventually they'll run out of ideas for new skins.
---
Except, it isn't.
---
&gt;Take a look at this guide on gearing
---
The thing is for the accessory side that guide is a *lot* of "grind these Living Story episodes you need to pay for" which I'm not exactly eager to do right now since I paid for two expansions and haven't even gone through the story of the first. I have my rings, and I have my amulet (which is useless for AR but still good for stats).
---
It has almost zero suggestions that are cheaper and easier than literally crafting ascended armor outside of those episodes. Some of those back pieces it offers as alternatives if you don't want to fork over the cash are &gt;80g.
---
I understand they're the best option but it's still a big ask if someone dropped the cash on the expansions and then is told if they want to actually get gear they need to fork over some more money. Not that I'm opposed to the idea of paying for the Living Story because I understand they're mini expansions in a sense, but I literally *just* paid for the expansions. Better guidance for the alternatives would be nice if I'm not invested enough/currently able to purchase the LS episodes.
---
&gt; 6 from rings 
---
I'm almost at T3 fractals (currently being held back by AR, I could pot to get into most of T3 with one more +7) and I would have to burn pretty much all of my relics/pristine relics to get the third slot on each of my rings.
---
I have received only *one* of the items needed for infusing a single ring so far, and it's one of the cheap ones.
---
Or I could spend those relics getting my helm and pants which also give 2 slots but give a higher stat total, more armor, and the stats the build I'm following wants. It just costs more gold at the moment but it's not an impossible to absorb cost, just uncomfortable.
---
&gt; So in sPvP you have all specs unlocked for all content 
---
I didn't actually check to see if I had the specs I hadn't unlocked myself because the last time I poked about in depth was before I purchased the expansions and since then I stopped going in on my Mesmer who is the only character I have with an elite spec (I was tired of the stats reflecting how useless I felt in a match). So at least I can fiddle with that now.
---
But I almost don't want to anymore because today was a bunch of games that were 500-24, 500-16, 500-12...
---
&gt;  you can get minstrel on all stat gear like the stuff offered in the WvW reward tracks ([legacy](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legacy_Armor_Reward_Track), [Triumphant](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Triumphant_Armor_Reward_Track), [Crystal Desert](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Crystal_Desert_Reward_Track)) or [stat swap](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing) other ascended drops you get 
---
But yeah as you mention later that WvW isn't something I can get into yet and 'other Ascended drops' is only a thing I believe is real because other people link theirs and I don't get any. It's sometimes a little demoralizing when the best options to get the gear are the things I'm trying to gear for.
---
No doubt but like Raid and Open world honestly are like two entirely separate modes of gameplay though
---
Having experience with both, it's curious to me that you'd see FFXIV as more casual friendly than GW2. Most of its content revolves around group instances. If you don't play as a tank or healer, it can take quite some time to get a group even with the finder. For leveling up you can do hearts on your own and most events are solo-friendly. At max level, most of the gold farms and the world bosses are on a timer sure, but there's almost always silverwastes running. You can work on world completion, mat farming, do wvw or spvp, work on collections and achievements, get mastery points and level up masteries, etc.
---
Now, maybe there's stuff about GW2 which you just don't like. Constantly re-rolling characters would suggest that. But having extensive experience with both, I find GW2 much easier to just hop in and play for a bit than FFXIV.
---
The biggest problem is we don't know what anet is/was planning for GW2. Even if it's as high as 33%, we'll still be seeing SOME people back on GW2 because I really don't think they'd lay off the entirety of the staff working on the other two projects... but that won't mean much if anet doesn't have anything planned besides "dripfeed just enough content that we can make it look like we're still supporting the game fully". We'll get LS updates a bit quicker... maybe? I'd like to think that they'd reorient themselves and rethink their longterm plans for GW2, but the fact that they're in this situation to beginwith wasn't because they had a lot of faith in the game itself or the playerbase imo.

\^(pls buff berserker)
---
By Ogden's hammer, what...
---
3 to 5 minutes?
---
When did you start playing? A lot of what you said is plain wrong, but at the same time you sound like you started since the beginning so I'm a bit confused.
---
&gt;When you look at the complaints WvW really cant ever be balanced to make the majority of GW2 players happy.
---
This is utterly wrong. Ever since torment was released, the majority of players did not want conditioned to be buffed. It made the game very boring in open fights. Anet literally continued to buff condition ever since then until we just had scourge firebrand trains. 
---
&gt;There is no real attachment to your server. 
---
When WvW was very popular, there was tons of server pride and attachment to your server. Just passing by Maguuma, Tarnished Coast, Jade Quary, or really any server back in the day would tell you..Especially Maguuma.
---
&gt; There is no reward for group effort and collectiveness.
---
Hey, guess what's one of the things that WvW players have been asking for since the start of the game? When we had tons of GvG guilds with a lot of server pride? Spoiler: We still don't have GvG areans, and Anet never wanted to support one of the few things that kept people in WvW. Guess what aspect of WvW (coughWinningWeeklycough) has been asked to be changed so there's a reason to work towards winning?
---
There were very easy improvements they could have made to make a lot of people happy. It honestly sounds like you missed out on the golden age of WvW and you joined after the mass exodus of popular guilds and players from the game.
---
This is a good explanation. People saying it is going to be like gliding aren't understanding that mounts are going to have a much larger impact on fights than gliding did.
---
Woo, welcome aboard:)
---
I've sent a PM if you ever need someone to help you out:) 
---
It took me 7 days to solve this problem, just wait for support team contact to you.
---
I don't quite get why people are so upset about the side projects.
---
Guild Wars 2 is almost 7 years old. There are very few games which have an endless lifecycle. Unless people truly believe that this game can stand 10+ years, Arenanet has to develop new titles, be it Guild Wars 3 or some other new IP. And to make new titles, they have to use what resources they have available.
---
That’s not what I’m saying, if someone is asking a question to you they are they are trying to get your opinion, any average joe could look up a wiki of whatever game they are playing 
---
Thanks for the response! 
---
I never saw anything wrong with them 'hiding' the fact, as long as it doesn't have detrimental effects on the game. As she always said, due to the talented people at Anet, they made it work, and boy did it work.
---
you still can glitch under mistlock sanctuary and find the water
---
That’s it? I couldn’t tell them half of that stuff and I’ve had my account like 5 years...  I had an issue with SMS on Origin a couple months ago.  I chatted with a rep for a few minutes, got sms disabled, and they gave me some credits on their system for a future purchase.  When I’ve opened tickets with ANET it takes a week or so to even get a response.
---
I take that back, I couldn’t by gems with PayPal for some reason, they fixed it and responded immediately .
---
Opening at level 80 does reward higher tier materials. The misunderstanding here is that higher tier doesn't mean they sell for more on the trading post.
---
For example:
---
Silk scraps (tier 5) current sell price: 25 copper
---
Linen scraps (tier 4) current sell price: 309 copper
---
This is mainly because so many players are already at endgame and salvage level 80 gear all the time, so the market is already flooded with t5 materials.
---
Glad im not the only one wondering this.
---
That has nothing to do with anything either you or I posted about, and games like TERA and Black Desert have largely the same combat. The only thing GW2 *really* does differently is letting you use a variety of weapons.
---
They still haven’t finished the legendaries for HoT (great sword). 
---
Tera omegalul
---
Can't agree more, don't worry about dying, it's just a game. As for wvw ability points, if you have HoT, I'd put the first 3 in gliding, then put points in Provision Master till you at at least get autoloot, then in supply capacity. Afterwards in supply master, but if you solo play alot you might like to put points in defense against guards instead of supply master then guard killer. Sorry if this sounds a  bit confusing. You'll figure it out as you play :)
---
If you are F2P you have to be lvl 35 to get into LA
---
Im a mainly wvw player and i am almost finishes withy legendary. It's a lot of work, and you have to go pve as well. But it is possible, it Just takes very long. Im over 2000 hours old in game now, but it's nering completion. Just need to get my world completion, damn getting that is one Boeing job.
---
Thank God for mounts making that easier.
---
Yeh I started when GW2 came out cause I played GW1
---
After I reached level 80 and completed the map that was it for me
---
Came back in the POF edition cause of the mounts and the Griffon mount made me fall in love with this game
---
Now I'm still playing and thinking of mastering raiding, Did master fracals expect challenge mode
---
I looked at the wiki and couldn't find much information past turning one into a ley infused lodestone. Can I turn all of them into ley infused? If so it mustbe only one at a time, because it currently won't let me turn them all in. Does only the first one change then you have to buy subsequent?
---
Ye I was wondering how to get the point across well. Because it is perceptively bad more than it is realistically bad. I often hear people complain at being asked to swap class or get kicked on reaper. Which is why i’m careful to suggest it to new players. 
---
In reality in a 3 dps comp reaper is more effective burst than holo for example but the majority of the pug community would rather take the holo.  And you can carry hard if needed too on blood. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah that is something I have come to learn when it comes to pvp. That and to stop panicking when another player comes at me lol.
---
F O U R R A I D W I N G S A Y E A R
---
As a New player i would Definetely reccomend first levelling to lvl 80. Explore the world, complete the maps, have fun and learn the game.
---
I had so Much fun levelling my first character and getting 100% completion on the maps.
---
For the base game you dont need the mount, and mounts take the fun away as well.
---
Finding the right path to all point of interests and vistas is fun, and you'll learn a lot about the game mechanica as well. 
---
It's not a mistery how companies. YOU don't know what they mean by project either. It could be anything from engine rework up to a new game.
---
The people buying gems, alt accounts and generally supporting GW2 are right to feel missled if those were gw2 unrelated things. It's unreliable sources so far of course but if it's true we were more invested in the game than they were.
---
Just because YOU moved on from the game doesn't mean everyone did. 
---
Read the note on the article for ley infused lodestone.
---
I'll expand weapons.
---
Each class like in wow is using different weapons. 
---
Typically 5 of your selected skills comes from weapon and other 5 from your class. 
---
On top of that you can carry two sets of weapons and those numbers change between classes and their mechanics but let's forget it for now.
---
For example, couple of classes can use greatsword but each class gets completely different skills out of it (including autoattack). Warrior will wield it like typical warrior, using relatively normally looking techniques, with nice combos. Guardian's skills are more magical. You will place magical symbols or shoot some magical stuff around. Mesmer (illusionist, scholar class) won't even use it as a sword. In his hands it becomes long range ray gun of death with spells like creating huge tip of sword popping up from beneath of enemy.
---
Now, depending on mix of your weapons you carry, traits and other skills your class can become anything, playing any role in it's own unique way.
---
As mentioned above, those classes are thematically similar to wow but gameplay wise may be different. And when it come to meta classes it's even possible that they don't match at all. I remember that I even saw someone saying that particular type of warlock plays exactly the same like one type of our ranger, while thematically are completely different.
---
Exquisite serpentine jewels
---
You can get a mount with very few things spoiled. You will get a raptor within minutes of starting PoF. I’d highly recommend completing some quests and mastery points and grabbing the Springer mount also. You won’t really spoil anything and you can get the other mounts without progressing the story.
---
Rift, ff14, and archeage are relatively dead. 
---
If you don't think they are dying you have really low standards. 
---
WoW is over 10 years old and has lost over half the players from it's peak.
---
Not LA. The previous poster was saying OP can press "B" and go to WvW to access obsidian sanctum. Since OP is only level 10, I was doubtful that can be done.
---
(and since you are here, thanks a ton for those spreadsheet and API calls! Life saviour)1
---
I used to get the same problem and i decided to remove the SMS authentication. It would be better if Anet uses Google Authentication or something similar. SMS authentication is not always fast and responsive.
---
So that would make any other unidentified lodestones useless I assume. I apologize I had missed that note before, also confused why they offer it for sale when you would only need 1
---
Need to picture this for prosperity
---
Noted, thanks. I was copying the layout of another image. 
---
What you're saying is nonsense. If one class was so profoundly overpowered that having more on your team practically guaranteed a win, then everyone could just play that class. There *is* no unfair advantage. Both teams have equal accesses to resources.
---
What sucks about it is that it's no fun to have a class be required for your gamemode because it's the most effective. And like I just told you, that's sucky for everyone.
---
It's once per account, maybe you'd want one on other characters too? 
---
Ranger using a rifle. Why? Cuz Rangers have it bad when it comes to ranged weaponary * gazes at longbow and stifles a cry * and rifle doesn't get nearly enough attention that I deserves. Before PoF came and we got snipers, the only time you saw rifles was when Engineers or Warriors felt like RPing. I don't do PvP or Fractals or Raids, so druid is something I don't play as, as fir Soulbeast, it completely removes the one thing I like about rangers, Pets. Yes they have horrid AI and all vanilla pets are crap, but still, I love my fruuy, scaly, feathery friends who revive me and draw aggro for me. 
---
how to deal with hysteria 101. don't fall for it.
---
gw2 has season 5 to look forward to which at least should tie us over till 2020 and anet has no reason to change ship to a different game
---
LWS2 also offers the ascended backpiece, Mawdrey, alongside a bloodstone dust converter, Mawdrey II. I believe it also gives access to Carapace/Bioluminescent Armor, if you’re a skin collector
---
If these sound worth it to you alongside the mastery points, achievement points, and story, then go for it and buy it
---
If you’re content without that stuff, then keep on playing with whatever you’ve got now :)
---
Ex wow player here who downloaded GW2 a few days ago, and i am loving it (admittedly i only have a level 10 and level 20 so far). I tried a few alternatives to wow, but this has been the best of them
---
The world feels well populated, and the game is making money- i imagine there will be at least one more expansion so i think any fears of the game dying any time soon are unwarranted.
---
You need to have HoT for gliding in WvW so I would assume you'll need PoF for the mount, yes. Not sure if there has been confirmation.
---
Probably not, you cant glide in wvw without HOT.
---
there will be no gw3. Gw2 won't be shuting down anytime soon
---
however 
---
if you are worried about long run.
---
it's better to pick FF14 or WoW. SE and Bilzz are not gonna die... and they don't rely their income on 1 game
---
It's funny cuz it's true 😂
---
Nope
---
You forgot people who play the tp
---
2 days ago I think they were on sale,I bought s3 with 720 gems.
---
What's up with the first link? It doesnt work.
---
As was my goal. Thanks!
---
I hear power deadeye is pretty good in Raids. They are kind of an annoyance in wvw, but I guess they are ok roaming.
---
I doubt that it will be a "good use" to craft asc stuff. That's 80g a pice down the drain when you can easily farm a complete armor + weapons + some trinkets in fractals. Even if you need pof or hot stats it's way better then crafting. Yeah it will take longer but will save you 600g and you will start making quite some gold with fracs as you drop your first prices and therefore can run higher frac levels. 
---
I saw that too, but because it had the tagline “you can buy 1 more at this price”, i wasn’t sure if it was a permanent deal because they were old, or an actual limited time sale
---
Either way, i’ve been keeping an eye on that “sale”, because if it comes up in the “going away soon” section of the gem store, then i’m definitely snagging them lol
---
I feel you. I've also been trying for months to learn DPS for raids, and I kill bosses and whatever all the time, but I can only get to 20k on golem, and any time I've tried something like Qadim training, I'm told my dps is trash and that clearly I don't have the right build or rotations, but I do, and I'm safely doing my rotations as if it's the golem. I try so hard and can't seem to break through whatever barrier it is. Keep on learning, I guess. I'm finding that raid skill comes in large steps and plateaus, not a gradual climb. 
---
I think role-players should take payment from opposite factions in WvW to drive people off the maps with weaponised solisoquies and throw matches. 
---
I was gonna write the same thing. Its baffling how some ppl cant understand this.
---
well damn, i just bought and spent 4k gems on the weekend. i didnt realise there were march sales
---
they kill me in wvw so I hate them obviously
---
same, i'll spend $100 on keys the second the chest is updated
---
Replace "Wood Farmers" with "Trader" - there you go.
---
Wow :)
---
I see what you mean, it’s not as active as you and I want it to be , but once in awhile I would see few people around. I usually play it with friends so I never seem to get to notice others tbh ^^ 
---
No.
---
*Eyy, another year! * It's your **6th Cakeday** BeurredeTortue! ^(hug)
---
That's how WvW works already. If 50vs50 are duking it out in open field and neither get a clear opening, a "small" 10-20 man guild joining the battle usually cause a complete steamroll. And with everyone running at near hardcapped speed, they are already "cavarly".
---
lol
---
PvP wise? Fuck deadeyes. It's ineffective with bad players at the very least but I've been hit by 19k Death's Judgements way too many times in Plat 3 to Legendary matches. It's actually disgusting.  
---
Otherwise you shouldn't care about what other people think or what I think. 
---
But you can use any authentication app. I went on an alt I don't care about (sorry it's french) if you click [here](https://i.imgur.com/5H4mi4F.png) which translate to "use an authentication" you end up [there](https://i.imgur.com/UrSlnFf.png). Clicking on any of the store link you to the official Google Auth and help you link it to your gw2 account.
---
It's not strange... There are side projects that are needing development you know... lul
---
Properly managed iteration is a part of game design, it’s been very clear this is not the case at anet and at times what they released had not shown signs of iterative improvement at all but last minute scrambling to get anything live. 
---
I just want My 50 bloodstone rubies T-T
---
Runescape did not get a lease on life because of mobile. The OSRS version we have now released in 2013 and grew in size and popularity every year because they listened to their playerbase and created regular and rewarding content. Mobile only came around after it was already popularized, not popularized because of mobile.
---
Meh
---
It's only like second breakfast compared to WvW players in full zerker gear anyway.
---
Nah, some will be prepared. Like the power reaper with 2860 toughness in my vg training yesterday.
---
Gw2 has been plagued with complete release schedule restructures, goal posts moved, delays and underdelivered content such as the HoT legendaries they still haven’t been fully implemented. 
---
There is a difference between investing resources into other projects and crippling your actual source of income in the process. 
---
Nobody is surprised they were working on other projects, they are surprised the state of affairs with those projects were so bad NCsoft had to step in and intervene. 
---
New player here! Is the longbow or the shortbow better for open world PVE ranger? What is the best pet without the expansion? Thanks :) 
---
Awesome =)

---
Presumably Anet wanted to avoid a 5 year wait between releases like they had 2007-2012. I would have thought people would support that. If Anet had said "Hey folks we're stopping development of Guild Wars 2 content, next game will be out in 2024, please keep buying new mounts for five years to keep us afloat though OK" I can imagine what the reaction would be.
---
Ah.
---
I... don't understand any of this.
---
At one point, I had all available achievements from the General, Living Story, ... (well, basically from every category aside PvP), that was pretty neat. Nowadays I'm unfortunately missing the stuff from the newest raid / fractal because I'm not that motivated anymore.
---
1. GW2 was never into maintenance mode. If it was it would be like GW1.
---
2. NCSoft *never pulled the plug.* They only merged their publishing division with Anet's *just as they were pre-HoT to ensure the above situation DOESN'T happen.* And to continue see profit from GW2.
---
3. Every company funds other projects or tries to work in more than one thing, its business. GW2 like it or not is a seasoned MMO soon to be 7 years old. Anet would be stupid NOT to have already started working in other projects or plan out their roadmap for the future - even if that doesn't include GW2.
---
Yes you can do those stories, and PoF even spoils EVERYTHING. From HoT, main story, everything that happened. But not exactly at the beginning though
---
Did Achievement Points to slowly and steadily hit that nice 33333 PA-spot. Almost there when suddenly that 5 AP butts in, rest is title.
---
I assume most Thief players are not good at their class considering the type of people that tend to gravitate towards that archetype. When I do happen upon a really good Thief, I am very pleasantly surprised at how high the skill ceiling can be for the class and I welcome them in my group or team in PvP. I think a lot of other players share this mentality because Thief tends to have a pretty equally high skill floor, but their lack of active defense makes them risky, so those who don't execute their builds well or know mechanics stand out a lot more negatively than some other classes. I don't see many Thiefs in Fractal groups, but I see more in raids, and a lot more in PvP. I don't think you should worry about picking the class up at all. If you enjoy it, you enjoy it and it will only push you to succeed on that class more.
---
For small trash I would say that LB could have a better burst thus allowing you to kill them faster. I would also advise that you pick a melee weapon on swap and play with it a bit (Greatsword has a great feel imo).
---
When you have a bit more mobs or they are stronger (meta event, world boss for example), shortbow will probably pull ahead, assuming you adapt your gear for it of course (with a condi gear). Because Shortbow is a condi weapon you will also notice it will work a bit less well in lower level zones (where you are underscaled) because condi DPS will perform worse there.
---
For pets I would say that Lynx (and maybe Jungle Stalker), Armored Fish (aquatic only) and Shark (aquatic only) are great (I didn't remember any other core land pet with a good dps other than Lynx unfortunately).
---
If you are still leveling up:
---
* Try out stuff, try out all the different weapons/utilities/traits, see what they do, how they feel could this synergize with that, etc
---
* Power weapons/traits/skills usually fares better than condi ones when you level up (but don't let that prevent you from applying the previous point for science nonetheless)
---
* Don't worry about buying/crafting gear with gold untill you get to level 80, just use what you loot/find to try not to have gear, especially wepaons, that is too much outdated compared to your level
---
On a more general note:
---
* If you only have the core game get yourself a warhorn (even if you only equip it to cast skill 5 while moving and equip a LB/GS/whatev back right after) because swiftness (and fury) is love
---
* Survival stats are nice but, especially in the core game, mobs have low health/armor so if you have very offensive gear they won't even have time to touch you (or only a little bit)
---
* If you have questions don't hesitate to ask in chat (even if you don't have access to map chat because you are F2P), people around you will usually try to answer them!
---
That's some fine wood on the mirage!
---
Deadeyes in pvp, at least i have encounter usually kill themselves with reflect. I mean literally kill them selves.
---
IF you open your bags , there's a little cogwheel at the top. It lets you deposit all materials ( like crafting material ingredients , you'll get A LOT ) into the bank without GOING to the bank. If you right click on a salvage kit , you can salvage a lot of stuff at once ( when you are higher level you will do this constantly ) . You get almost no gold as drops , it all comes from selling stuff on the Trading Post to other players ( I have no idea how FTP players make gold ) . Join a good guild that welcomes new players , it will add a lot to your experience ( people to play with , to help you , to ask questions of , to chat with ) . Good luck.
---
Try warrior or guardian.
---
LMAO this gave me a non stop chuckle for a min.
---
Great charr pvp btw
---
Next chance at 44,444
---
When backing the navmesh there are usually simple angle and gap thresholds being used. As stated before: if a ramp you can use leads up to sth it's supposed to work. If it is a platform that has walls that are closer to 90/vertical it shouldn't. 
---
I checked in-game , Fallen Balthazar is indeed in the GWU , so it obviously hasn't been retired. That means that's it's at least possible for it to pop back up on the gem store in the future.
---
No clue about PoF, but as far as Mordy is concerned, in the final battle right after launch of HoT I got Trahearne in my fight instead of one of the order mentors (on a new Revenant at that point). After I had completed the previous personal story and redid it, Sieran (in my case) showed up like normal
---
I would assume they programmed a similar contingency for PoF.
---
The whole Nightmare Court storyline is a travesty. In fact, most of the factions that are hyped up as huge enemies have been so poorly told, limited mostly to some map stories and a final dungeon story battle.
---
At least The Inquest pop up every now and again.
---
Its better to go for bank slots as its universal to your account and regardless of time.

I won't read what other posters have said because i'm a bit sleepy right now BUT - If you want to do WvW the ideal class you could go for especially on doublexp week coming up is scourge with staff. follow this build [http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vRAQNAW3dnE9CN9i10Au0As9iFcBDaAEAOA6H2I7klKN0GeWA-jVSBQBoRJYCV/BAHEADu/Ae0NohnAwVUe0FlYL4CAEAAB4m3Mb2mB38m38m38m1m38m38m38m38m3sUArOZD-w](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vRAQNAW3dnE9CN9i10Au0As9iFcBDaAEAOA6H2I7klKN0GeWA-jVSBQBoRJYCV/BAHEADu/Ae0NohnAwVUe0FlYL4CAEAAB4m3Mb2mB38m38m38m1m38m38m38m38m3sUArOZD-w) and don't even mind the ascended gear needed. you can use plain exotic soldier stats which you can buy with wvw currency from armorsmith vendors in ebg or the borderlands (or even using dungeon tokens or pvp tokens etc). im a vet and i still use that on my necro, im lazy to gear her up to full ascended so it should be fine for you too :) good luck with pvp btw! i only mentioned wvw because you said you want to dip your toe in wvw later so i cut straight to the point xd
---
I recommend getting to about level 40 *then* using the boost on another character and getting the mount. That way, you get the full noob experience but also have quicker travel.
---
Because it would take more than 1 day to clear everything? What a horror...
---
Hey Thank you ! Alone =) 
---
I understand your worries. When it comes to MMOs I've only played GW1 and GW2 extensively, and what with GW1 servers still around I've never had to deal with it being gone. But yes, as people ahve said above - enjoy it for the gamne that it is. Everything has to end sometime, that doesn't/shouldn't lessen the experience :)
---
&gt;You can clear all the raids in full greens if you really wan
---
You can clear raids in other MMOs with sub-optimal gear if you wanted, but why would you.
---
Heya! So if you want to enjoy your week in WvW with the doublexp and all, give a shot to scourge with staff using this build

Don't even worry about not having full ascended, you can easily get soldier stats with scholar runes on exotic and be fine, and get them with wvw or dungeon currency or even fractal one(not sure if they have them) for reduced cost. Additionally you might wanna have a look here:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/at3k7q/tips\_faq\_welcome\_to\_wvw/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/at3k7q/tips_faq_welcome_to_wvw/)

feel free to inbox me with more questions and such!

\*\*Spellbreaker isn't used much right now, they are useful for the bubble which is the elite skill they have, but you might have difficulty tagging lots of people/getting xp. With the necro build i suggested you are able to go full force melee on frontline or even stay backline and range if you fancy. In any case, jump in and see how things go :) 
---
My guardian is Brienne-inspired.
---
I was also aware the whole thing was a bit male-dominated so I wanted a female adventurer type, and who can argue with someone that badass? 
---
I'd also like Wintersday and Halloween to this list. These two events haven't seen any major changes for some time.
---
First, Riot games is an exception to the rule. You can't compare the magnitude of those games, LoL has or had ~65 million players while Gw2 barely reaches 1 million if that much. 
---
Either way, Grinding Games is owned by Tencent, the same company that owns Riot Games and they're a much smaller company. 
---
Digital Extremes has other projects besides Warframe, currently in closed beta apparently there is a new MMO in the makings.
---
Anet might do well with only one game .. till it doesn't. What happens then? No game to make profit off, would take them 4-5 years to make one, 4-5 years without any profit for the same company? 
---
I started playing a week ago and sus just that. Takes you about 15 min and makes the game much more enjoyable. You won't be able to use the mount in missions.
---
i'm sure they can. It's just that some people on this subreddit are ArenaNet zealots.
---
Flamingos more sticky than publics itt.
---
sorry but do you really believe GW2 will get at this point another expansion?
---
this game makes less and less money with almost every quarter. we can be happy if this game still gets updates for the next 2-3 years.
---
Many world boss encounters will leave your fps barely above 10, and maps like Verdant Brink will be tough to play in. The Mordremoth fight in Dragon's stand is also a bit tricky for some computers.
---
For reference, I have around 50 fps in LA and yet I drop to 10-20 in Verdant Brink's Wyvern night boss. But to answer your actual question, I don't think there's any content you should avoid for any other reason than not wanting to take part in low fps fights. 
---
Generally you should only avoid content if it ruins the experience of someone else due to your low fps, but I can't think of anything that applies. Fractals generally have higher fps, the same applies to dungeons and for example WvW zergs won't suffer too much as long as you're trying to help, even if you're lagging a lot.
---
Some raids might make your fps drop a lot, but I am not sure. Either way, you shouldn't think about avoiding content due to fps before you actually try them out.
---
people play mobile games out of boredom and a lack of access to play anything else, i play solitaire and other such games when i am on a bus or waiting for an appointment. it's not obnoxious, mobile games are objectively worse than pc games in just about every way except for convenience. i read somewhere that the reason the chinese market is so big is because many of them are stuck on a 4 hour ~ commute to work every day, of course they're not going to play a pc game, they're going to use what just about everyone these days has. anet are pretty much a one trick pony, gw2 somewhat coasted off the success of gw1 and they had a fanbase already built by the time they released the game, since it's release there have been questionable decisions and bad PR, judging from their sole current title (gw1 doesn't count, only 2 guys work on it in their spare time or something like that) i can safely say that there newer titles would not have been that much better. the problems with gw2 go all the way to the top of anet and it is naive to assume that the unannounced projects would have been better, especially since they've been axed. if they were good, they wouldn't have been axed.

Lol reaper buffs.

Rotation in pvp refers to something completely different to what you would do in pve and raids.  
---
Understand and react with your skills in pvp as required.  
---
Rotation in pvp refers to what i like to call how not to die strategy and below you can find a slightly outdated link on how to pvp but most of the concepts are still relevant. 
---
Oh I believe her and I think there is plenty to criticize  (giving episode teams less funding and hiding this info so players would turn on them and agressively attack them for actually doing an amazing job considering the resources) . But if people truely belive this is low quality or low effort content they have a really bad memory:
---
* Remember the launch story? I know story isnt that important to many who dwell here on reddit but when comparing the production value and storytelling we are so far better off than originally it's hard to put into words.
---
* Remember Season 1? I like that the devs were experimenting with stuff, but compared to the content realease now it was a mess. Yes it was at times rather frequent, but sometimes the content would be less than what is now considered "sidestoryies/currentevents".
---
* remember pre-hot? almost a year of no updates?
---
* remember hot? I know now everyone likes it and thinks its the best expansion - not so much after launch.
---
* remember post hot? The better part of a year with no updates?
---
* remeber season 3? unfinished maps such as bitterfrost, tiny maps such as bloodstone? Sotrycontent in the earlier episodes was 1 Rata Novus instance + runnign around on a new map doing hearts?
---
Right now we have a had a continious stream of content sicne the launch of season 3, including PoF, including season 4 and are scheduled to slide right into season 5. This is by far the longest stream of steady content we have had in the lifetime of gw2. We get a map each release (something Im personally sceptical of but the communtiy loudly demands), the maps are larger than any previous LS maps, larger than quite a few core maps and hold more content than almost every Season 3 map. The story instances are more involved, the cinematics are higher impact. We are alsmost at the point of finalyl having all the gen2 legendaries, something we've been waiting for since HoT. The Devs have started with lore blogposts again, somthing that was heavily requested. Even WvW is getting updates. sPvP finally has ATs somethign we have been waiting for since 2013. We get fractals somewhat regularly - would I mind more of them? Not at all, but new the fractal release rate has always been wonky and right now with one every other episode or so we are actually better off than we have been at most times. Should there be more raids? I would love that, but pretending the content stream is at the worst it has ever been is simply untrue.
---
Ok
---
Well, hopefully it actually helps retain people in WvW. It's related skills or potential masteries may mean people stay in WvW quite a while. No information has been announced, as far as I know, detailing how long it will take to get the mount or hour difficult it will be to acquire. With the frequency of posts like these, one comes to wonder if WvW people are somehow **trying** to gatekeep the mode and effectively destroy it in the long run. Shouldn't WvW players hope that the update keeps players in WvW?
---
After all is said and done I feel so vindicated about my feelings for the game and it's direction since launch. I don't like being an emotionally abused partner as Derior states but I definitely didn't expect it from a video game company. If they had other projects running they should have been more transparent about it. My money was for Anet yes but it was to make gw2 better. 
---
As somebody else mentioned it’s possible to get it without using the level 80 boost with the help of another player. If you haven’t used the boost yet let me know and I could walk you through it on NA or get you in touch with somebody on EU.
---
I've noticed many lines of dialogue for the Norn male player character that get the Human male voice actor instead. My assumption is that there was a production crunch, they couldn't get the right voice actor for the lines they needed, or they mismanaged the organization and goofed up the lines expecting no one noticed. In my case, it was definitely more subtle than this incident with Braham, but being that I have mained a human male player character since launch, the goofed up dialogue in the cut scenes was really jarring and ruined my immersion. 
---
Man, how the hell were they let into a training raid?
---
30 hours and 30000 hours, respectively
---
Or OP can go to the pvp-lobby, there is also everything in there and it unlocks pretty early for F2P-Players.
---
Nonsense and shittalking in team chat is a staple of WvW, now and forever. 
---
[There you go](https://imgur.com/a/EuQ43II) 
---
&gt; Personally, it does kind of take away from the "new player experience" if you can run around everywhere with a mount, since none of us at the start were able to do that.
---
This argument is not that compelling. The main difference from the real "vanilla new player experience" is that it's no longer 2012 outside. You and the world have changed to such an extent that there is an irrecoverable gap between the experience of a new player today, regardless of mounts or gliding, and a new player back  at release. Trying to chase that "experience" is futile.  
---
There is no good reason to specifically avoid the convenience of having at least the starting mount. 
---
I had similar problem but I solved it by writing the keyboard keys of a rotation on a paper and kept it until I actually remembered the keys. I don't remember the skills, but I remember the keys.
---
Wrong. You mean freshly boosted characters in soldiers 
---
Because it wont. I mean if the only thing you got to PvE open world after years of nothing is a mount, nothing but that, would the game surive that? Sure people will try it out cause yay cool new thing. But after a few weeks people are still on the same spot, the same bugs, the same issues that do not grow the population, but hey you have a mount so why are you making so much fuzz over the other stuff that is actaully the reason people leaving.
---
&gt; PvE: Participation System, currently only in place for the 4 HoT Maps, More Participation meant a better outcome of rewards and enticed you to work together in the map so everyone can reach that end goal.   
---
although it worked in a way, Anet gave up on this system for LS3 and PoF (where i expected it to make a return for those warbeast skins etc)
---
Pssh, even that pales in comparison to THREE talent system overhauls we had before HoT was even revealed
---
Don't know whether she should have a book back piece or red spinals
---
Context is important. Zerk gear is not necessarily bad. PVEers are not necessarily bad. Put them both together and the likelihood of them being bad increases.
---
No thank you.

Yeah...clearly you didn't understand my last reply to you that explains just how stupid you're being about this. You'll explain to people in some comments that gw2 has been siphoning employees to other projects, thus bleeding the game of resources to develop it, and in other comments that everything they're doing is "just how business works," with long pontificating paragraphs speaking generally about departments, and that everything is basically fine though you have no personal stake in the company, that we shouldn't even question them &amp; that they know what they're doing despite a now long track record of shitty decision making and poor reception of customer feedback that's effecting the game most people on this sub are here to support. You sound either really stupid or like you're being paid. Which is it?

OP asked for opinion on best way to grind gold. In my opinion, this is the best way to grind gold. Nothing said about ingame or out. It's not a smartass answer, simply the most efficient one.

Now we've peaked to a whole new level of grammar.
---
You know it.
---
At this point, seeing these threads, I do have to wonder.
---
How do people actually think this will unlock, that it would take people a week and then they leave again?
---
I can only suspect it will be a simple case of "spend your rank points". (and maybe some Skillpoints/Memories of Battle)
---
Anything limited by WvW Rank would scare off anyone, that doesn't care about investing time. 
---
Any ticket cost that is reasonable (100-ish) would not take long enough for PvE'er to have a really notable impact on the game more. An an unreasonable cost say (1000) is too much for people to even bother, seeing as the impact on PvE besides the &gt;do want&lt; aspect is simply too small.
---
Wait do you use my bns api? That is where I made most of teh teh jokes.

Don't want to insult you, but there where times - before season three rolled out - where ppl truly hated dragon stand for what it is. And not much has changed since. HoT Maps even after the april 2.0 patch where described as worst maps in guild wars 2 for a long time. Nearly until pof dropped. And those infusion was implemented quite late for auric basin while the verdant brink one has never seen the light of the day but ppl are still running and where running those maps earlier. In the end they are not rly a driving factor for these maps. The reason why HoT maps are so popular is that they reward you with something that you can not get anywhere else without a significant loss in your pocket,  are on a set timer where they allign perfectly and lastly because they have a unique currency for every map that is needed in more than one place even if this is a minor point. Most player will simply drown in these currency after quite some time. All of  that Anet achieved only trough several reworks and nearly one and a half year worktime after there initial implementation. The death branded shatterer also has an infusion but most of the time you will not find a random group to do it. The good thing is, that all these new season four maps are balanced for smaller groups. You can actually kill the death branded shatterer with ten ppl and that is where these maps truly shine. Sure they are pretty easy to zerg over as long as they are new but at least for me the true enjoyment of those maps comes from the months after the majority rushed over them.
---
Guild Wars 2 - at least on the pve side - is more or less a completionist game. And in that regards thunderhead peaks is going quite strong. The last two maps I got so much enjoyment out where the domain of istan and draconis mons. But if the collecting side of the game is not an appeal for someone I can absolutly understand why thunderhead can feel shallow. But on the other hand the whole pve side of guild wars 2 will feel shallow if you are not a collector in some regards (skins or achievments or personal accomplishments). Because than you will do everything until you have beaten it exactly once and move on. No mmo can sustain such behaviors. At least not in the long run.
---
Yes, infusing or attuning an item gives you a new item with the extra slot. If it is stat selectable (like this back) you'll be able to select again.

People who post drawings here are either artists themselves sharing their work or they are people who have paid for their characters to be drawn and just want to share with others (plus it boosts exposure for the artist who made it so they can potentially get more work). If you want your character drawn you will need to get in touch with artists which you can find on Instagram or social media related to GW2, art streams, discords, forums etc. Do a bit of lurking theres lots coming up - i'm one myself :)

Sounds similar to how pug raiding works in any game.

Your lawsuit argument is legit hahaha. 'Big companies bad, big companies get away with all bad things' - yes, they would get away, because what you are saying is nonsense. Like I said, if it was considered a spyware, there would have been consequences. The legal aspect is also interesting, but I would avoid giving you a lesson on that too, because you probably have 'friends in law' xD.
---
Yes, PunkBuster uses the same kind of logic, like I said. To simplify so that daft people like you will understand, is that it's also monitoring background processes, which was the main issue for most people on the forums. When you install a game with anti-cheating options, you consent to this. When you install PunkBuster, you do the same, only difference it is a standalone application.

Could try to tweak your settings and get a little better performance with [this guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8gctrf/full_guide_maximizing_your_fps_and_game/).
---
I did not specify because it's not my main area of expertise. But I guess you have more experience then.
---
If you mean not being accessible to casual players then yes. In any pvp game noobs get farmed and there is no matchmaking to introduce new players. So basically, it's going to be a crapshoot where the few experienced players are gonna go around stomping on the PvE tourists. At least that's what's been happening there last few influxes.
---
I like how they didn't even use Arcane Shield at all after engaging lol.
---
That'll be the only way for a commander to get people on the map probably
---
Serious question. Do you know any artists who actually do commissions? What would a reasonable rate for such a thing be?
---
at least 150 on each for the first 2 days
---
I don't really agree that they made it work. The story quest lines have still been good but the actual updates around ls4 haven't been that good. We've been seeing delays, maps that feel half finished, and barely anything with fractals, raids and PvP. If they were working on an xpac or something big the mess season 4 has been wouldn't be that bad but it seems like they were just buying time for themselves to get their next project out.
---
Nightmare Court is a huge joke of a faction.
---
They never did as much damage as Aetherblades, and even on a local scale, they didn't have as much presence as the Flame Legion. 
---
And then there are roleplayers.
---
All 69 character slots
---
it's true tho... when we take 5 minutes to kill the 1 min VB matriarch bc people just don't know/want to cc, I do get a bit annoyed D:

(ok part of the fault lines with ANet who never once in the game explains players what the breakbar even is, and what cc skills are)
---
Eighty gold is high for an ascended weapon, where the average cost to craft one is 52-55g, and even moreso for ascended armour, where the average cost to craft is 45-50g.
---
Let's do an experiment. Since you're claiming that you can "easily farm" ascended gear in fractals, I'm going to ask you for proof to back up your claim. Go ahead and do the math, and show everyone reading what "easy" means in this context. I can craft an ascended weapon or armour piece in about a minute with materials on hand. How quickly can you get the same item from doing fractals?
---
Because mmos are a dying genre in general. They are to continue to exists but they are not going to have the popularity they had in the past.  
---
They can continue improving the game, but as a company they gamble in that doing a other IP, or other Game was more stable for the future, and they lost. Now they are obligated to improve the game, so its good for us. 
---
Depends on how much your average playtime is for one week. 30 hours a week? Than sure. If you are willing to go the long route and craft every weapon skin that is available within this episode the average joe will take more than two weeks. To craft 16 ascended weapons - bound to 81 achievements - is not a minor task. Even for longterm players. Especially cause you can not simply buy them via gold. If you are a veteran player and quite used to farming with multiple characters you can achieve this goal within two weeks for sure but if you only have a hour per day and are only playing your one main and maybe one other character you will need about one and a half months to gather enough branded masses for those 16 weapons alone.
---
People having fun killing their opponents in a PvP game mode?
---
While I agree with most of what you've wrote, and already in my original post conceded that WoW mythic raiding is significantly most challenging than GW2 raiding I feel obliged to point out that a very noticeable amount of the difficulty of WoW mythic raiding on release is the fact that the raiders are heavily undergeared. 
---
And yeah my comments about DPS meters were mostly in reference to farm raids I'm already familiar with, just saying that with DBM holding my hand I have to pay way less attention in WoW than in GW2 on farm bosses which still require my attention if not provide an actual challenge. 
---
If one think. They alredy did that when they put the Pinnacle weapons skin, and Radiant and Hellfire Skins like 5 years ago.

The mastery points are, mostly, extremely hard to achieve.

It's a story piece with a few neat boss battles and sets up Heart of Thorns and later story points, but it's the least essential of the three seasons.

MWAH!! BELISSIMO! BRAVO!!!

Brand is horrible, ruins it for me personally.
---
i was referring to the teleportation. the water below every map is unavoidable for the devs
---
Some really casual players often struggle to afford a single gear. Being more welcoming would actually help them getting involved into WvW and willing to spend ressources on it. We need more people.
---
You are the equivalent of a secretary that says i work at this law firm. That much is obvious. Ta-ta :)
---
I play ele a lot, i have been running in WvW the past week trying to not be so scrub for when the surge happens. I run full zerker ele in blobs, and it has been a blast! My meteor shower is hitting folks for 8k a shot and creating a pile of downs is great! But yeah, if I mess up where I need to be standing, a strong fart kills me. Not the most optimal setup I am sure, but dang does it wreck!

&gt;Repairing things is also cheaper than creating new things

I think he meant _teeth_ ?

Oh how i miss old lions arch.

oh yeah think I remember doing it now.

How hard is it to understand that it's just as definite a game mode as PVE raids/fractals? If you come in selfish, unprepared and unwilling to co-operate then you are a detriment to your team.
---

---
He meant “thief”. 
---
Thief, I reckon.
---
It was just an example. A System introduced in an expansion and quickly given up on
---
It's okay, your frames will thank you.
---
That's my point.  The time to reach nearest camp from spawn feels a good bit longer for Hamm's Lab than any other.  Maybe it's my perception though.
---
A trench style stalemate around a line of defense where progress is made by sneaky back capping and avoiding enemy players is already dominant on dbl and the major reason it isn't fun. 
---
All objectives are favouring defenders in nature. Having absurdly defensive structures only removes objectives as something to fight, for unless one side has a massive advantage. Similar strength groups don't have proper objectives to fight around at all. This is terrible design.
---
I want to play wvw and fight enemy players and groups, not play hide and seek. I'll wager most wvwers are with me on this. 
---
Oh no, those poor casual players! Where can I send all my gold right now?
---
if it's intended, it's bad design  
---
if they're in the middle they are literally getting wacked in the head with a solid light hammer. there is no reason for the knockup to not apply
---
Yeah, I mean I may swap to full zerk on a power scourge for fun but most time I run tankier trinkets so I don't die immediately on a push.
---
Last time I ran full glass on something was on staff ele back in pirate ship days.
---
not a balance expert but these ideas don't sound good.
---
How is fps in 5 man content (pvp, dungeons, fractals)?
---
where do i look for raid training groups? (specifically w6)
---
i raid with a static group once a week and we never get to w6 due to time constraints, so i'm in a situation where i have more than 1,000 LI but have never killed Qadim.
---
It is all fixed with cavalery flanking. Just wait for tomorrow.
---
That's just a mediocre reset in t1. 
---
As a WvW noob, the fact I've to run back to the fight for several minutes (either got killed during my runs to join the commander, either the squad was wiped) is quite unfun. So having a way to get in faster will be *maybe* a reason for me to play more WvW. 
---
I will see how that turns out anyway
---
Bad design indeed, bit it always was like this
---
Hell, ill give WvW another try.

Is zerker gear not meta in WvW?

It's a yearly sales in March, most things in the Gem Stores are discounted. [Check out previous Sales.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/March_sale)

oof, these are all quite terrible.   this the opposite of how balancing a game works.

if a racer had special sneakers that helped him go faster, the way to balance that race wouldn't be to cut everyone's legs off.

I agree with you, 90% of people in these comments are being assholes. And then they complain that WvW needs more players.

Once again, iteration on ideas is only a good thing if they are building on and improving. We’ve had many instances of the building s system in its entirely only to scrap the whole thing and start again.
---
They built an entirely new reward system to unify map rewards, then largely ignored it and used different methods for every other release. 
---
The legendary system was a huge mess which had lead to the community still not getting the full set that was meant to be in HoT. 
---
People expecting content they paid for four years ago is not acting entitled.

This person is memeing, but...
---
Jessica Price mentioned in a tweet that the LS staff was slimmed down because people were pulled onto side projects. Now the side projects are being hit by layoffs, effectively canceling them.
---
Man i can't wait to read Team chat after patch releases!
---
&gt;And WvW is more comparable to world events (it even feels more like it than anything else in PvE)
---
Ah, and this is how I figure your opinion on this matter is moot.
---
&gt; HIDE YOUR MINI IN WVW it doesnt get stealthed and will follow you
---
But what if I want to be a spy?
---
What do you mean "Empower"?
---
I'm glad you mentioned about end game expectations in terms of range.  That changes things.  Funny little plot twist...  Last night, I created a Mesmer and I L O V E it.  Call me crazy, but I swear I can kill significantly faster than with the Ranger I made.  I'm sticking with the Mesmer for now :)
---
Yes https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Faction_Provisioner
---
If the squad wiped the commander would also be in spawn.
---
Both sides running back faster makes pushing past the halfway point more difficult.
---
It really depends on the server, some are more casual friendly/PPT oriented while others are stacked with more competitive players/fight oriented.
---
Thanks.
---
Nothing. In the light of the recent layoffs and what they actually worked on, I won't be spending money on anet.
---
What content can you not do anymore in GW2? Other than the crap that was removed, but many games have that, even the beloved WoW has that. They have removed entire systems from that game at times.
---
we are legion. join us
---
Oh thats nice and [EDGY](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/898/225/120.jpg)! Just as expected from a WvW player &lt;3
---
Staff DD is sometimes accepted.
---
&gt; Why is DBL so unpopular?
---
Mostly it's because people don't understand the map. You'll see lots of complaining about how overly defensive DBL is, but that's just people who haven't taken the time to figure out the multiple places where siege can hit the various keeps while being almost completely protected from counter siege.
---
For example, south outer wall of the eastern keep can be easily trebbed from SE camp with just a little help from a spotter. Every location where the defenders could build shield generators that are able to block the trebs is also a spot the trebs can easily hit to destroy the shield gens. 
---
For the western keep, there are multiple places where catas can hit the outer walls while being out of range of any defensive siege. However, those locations all require thought to locate and more skill with the catas than just holding down the 2 key.
---
So, the perception is that DBL allows 10 to easily defend against 50, but that's only true if the 50 run up and bash themselves against a wall/gate. 
---
What this guy said.
---
Sorry but many players are plugging their ears and refusing to listen. And even if they want to listen, if they don't have appropriate gear they are dead weight.
---
T1 fractals are a walk in the park with 0 requirements. Enemy players aren't going to go easy cause they're a noob in yellow year. They're going to kill them repeatedly and jump on their corpse for good measure.
---
Yes, that's what WvW desperately needs. To be even less welcoming to new players.
---
Ooh guardian !! Nice! I’m going to make that next !
---
The answer isn't don't play. The answer is find a group that wants you.
---
If I want to play high end but I must cater to every noob that comes along, then I cant ever do that. The result? Most commanders don't play because it's not fun for them.
---
I didn't say don't play. I said look for a proper group that suits you. 
---
Thank you
---
Not really. I am an IT consultant though like I said in my other post. But 2/10 for trying to be funny
---
Thank you for proving my point.
---
[Here is a good video detailing it](https://youtu.be/iR2lak59yB8), tekkit also has one but his has some mistakes.
---
When there is a pattern of such issues it’s not “douchy” to point it out and the community are justified in any criticism. 
---
It’s been pretty apparent for a long time that they’ve had a problem balancing iteration with realistic project management. The devs lack of communication cannot be blamed on the community because even that was poorly managed and involved random comments from devs without approval and not a single roadmap. 
---
I'll run around in the Desert place on occasion. Good for Flipping Camps when the other zones are zerg-central .
---
Clippy is everywhere, even if only in our hearts. 
---
Two morn character slots, and maybe some outfits.
---
I enjoy fractals with all the classes except engineer as it’s the only class I don’t have.
---
It depends on my mood tbh..
---
But if I had to pick I would be torn between 
---
Guardian DH zerk can switch to FB to support 
---
or Ranger SoulBeast condi can switch to support/healer Druid.
---
This is good to know. I'm currently doing baby fractals with a group that has less experience than I do (which isn't much). So I have a while yet ... better start saving now.
---
"Retreat!" My main is a guardian. Hearing that every time I charge into battle is still grating.
---
Oh, I figured they might be, but its also fairly possible they were being serious. I had read up on everything that was going on when the layoffs broke, just sorta wanted to waste his/her time for wasting mine.
---
Still, I love completing the griffon races, challenging myself to shave off as much as I can from my best times. That sorta thing. was really surprised there wasn't any in TP
---
Hardly anyone runs full zerk these days, even for pirateship. Simply not worth the risk when you can get 1 shot out of nowhere.
---
Most will being running 50:50 marauders / zerk at most. When you are an ele or thief the difference between 11k HP and 15k HP is night and day.
---
Duuude.... My rank is barely above 100 after a year of playing WvW
---
Yeah I agree with you entirely. That's why I don't tend to do open world everyday but now and then for fun.
---
I found an old video series of mine the other day... Didn't even remember that I did a 50 minutes sightseeing tour through old LA. The video quality is abyssal and my commentary on things sucked, but I am still glad I found it.
---
I've never understood waiting to be ressed. WPs in core Tyria are all over the place and even in the newer PvE areas, with mounts, it's not like it's exactly a trudge to get back to wherever you died. I've always seen it as a more convience feature than anything.
---
Though, it could be a hold over from older MMOs, I guess.
---
Can't turn something ugly into something beautiful, without completely replacing the base.
---
&gt; Its sad to see people trying to contribute but their voices not heard :(
---
Are you new to gaming and internet communities ?
---
Yup, it is the most strict. It is ridiculously strict. GW2efficiency players are probably the more active part of community, and my WvW rank is still higher than 67% of them, while I have only 109 rank... after a year playing WvW whenever queue was not too long. 
---
To be fair, at the beginning of Path of Fire you are so far ahead in the story that it's really hard to make sense of the spoilers... but that's my take on it
---
No. And my comment is only relative to the lack of attention in WvW in this particular case/recent years by Anet that have done close to nothing when it comes to recommendations, suggestions and player feedback.
---
I think the mount could be the thing to fix this. The main problem is that DBL is too large and we know from PVE that mounts have a way of making the maps feel smaller.
---
WvW is gatekeeped at it's core. Imagine what would have happened, if only 10 first players could access each raid per server, and accessing it for anyone who comes later requires him waiting in queue for someone among those 10 to leave? 
---
Nom nom nom. Rangers with a side of pets on the menu 
---
I do wish Anet would return to some of the old factions, I find the Nightmare court interesting with the way they tie into normal sylvari. We never really got to see the rest of the story of them since it got cut in HoT. (Along with Malyck...)
---
I presume this will also require a special reward track for extra bonus item. Kinda like gift of battle. They'll do anything to drag out the acquisition of new mount to keep people play a bit longer. And then pve players will go "done, never again" and leave, WvW players will sigh "finally no more noobs" and then continue to complain that not enough people play WvW :) 
---
Had so many Aha-Moments in this thread. Thank you, guys.
---
well, none of my (or your) business. 
---
A WvW post I agree with. This is a weird feeling.
---
Really beautiful portrait, you have won another follower \^\^
---
Haven't been on rit in a while but I used to see qadim and largos trained every couple of days there.
---
I will believe that the mounts in WvW will need a balance  
---
One of the ideas i was thinking of was to make the lord (champion of the fort) a player. A player with his skills placed in role of a champion with few restrictions in self healing and dodging (maybe more when tested)  
---
Or other idea to make the lord system more of a 5 player composition (dungeon mechanic) where it will be limited to how fast it would be put down and for allies to be contested.  
---
mounts may put the game into more active state where respawning and getting back to fight possible  
---
OFC hard to say much without testing out.  
---
OFC i will abuse every possible way of mounts till they get nerfed or putting wvw into a dark age :D
---
&gt; One thing I noticed having a mount vs not having a mount, is that all of the minor jumping puzzles and the vistas that require you to go off the beaten path are just totally nullified.
---
Yes they are, but that isn't a bad thing in itself. It's a type of "content" that most people loathe. Well yes, I'm aware that the vocal minority on reddit loves it, but ask most people in game - or, more importantly, the people who've quit the game. Many will cite it as one of the most annoying parts of the game.   
---
As much i would love this too, it takes away much of what make the game a free for all mode. It would be more balanced? Sure, but at cost of variety and fun. I rather have they just standardize the stats and damage. Something like cut wvw damage/healing by half would be a good start.
---
Having the PvP build menu would be great IMO because it enables every player to change their build on the fly.
---
Whatever happens to you in a fight, be it as a solo roamer or a Zerg fighter, you could adjust your playstyle depending on the situation. It would also make Roaming and Zerging much easier in which players could freely switch between those things and have different builds that actually make sense in those scenarios. Any player would benefit through this because you don't have to spend the gold on a completely new Gear set that could get obsolete by the next balance patch.
---
So I don't know why WvW veterans should be against this because they would actively lose one of the "PvE" aspects in WvW.
---
I mean considering casual players are generally the majority of the playerbase, you shouldn't act all elitist towards them. You're just alienating a huge portion of the community for no reason. 
---
You should stick with the one you are going to be using most of the time on as many of the characters you play as possible.   
---
Say, I wouldn't go for focus, despite binding of ipos being one of the coolest concepts/ideas. Only a few builds of a couple of classes really use focus at all, and not even in most of the game modes. You just won't be seeing it the majority of the time unless you are playing a power guardian, and dare I say it, the whole idea of a demonic grimoire fits the guardian class fantasy rather poorly.   
---
Most of the 2nd gen legendaries take a similar amount of gold, but the ones with forced collections (like astralaria that you mention) are extra pain in the ass to collect. Gotta do all of those quests that are totally not quests instead of just buying 20 more thousands of ore from tp. 
---
I had the time and checked things out. Not counting random drops, it takes a minimum of 18 days to create a full ascended armour set using BLING-9009, and that's if you get 5 fractal research pages a day. If you get 3 a day it takes an entire month to create an armour set. That requires that you do T4 fractals every day, which isn't something the majority of people are prepared to do. It can be done quicker through crafting of daily timegated materials.
---
Interestingly, even if you do craft ascended gear through BLING-9009, you *still* need to have at least one crafting discipline at 500 in order to make the grandmaster marks necessary. Even more interesting is that the materials required for the grandmaster marks use... the same timegated daily crafting materials that you use to craft ascended armour without using BLING-9009!
---
Even if you get fractal armour or weapon chests as drops, which isn't guaranteed, chances are very high that their stats won't be what you need, and you'll have to craft or buy an insignia in order to convert the drop in the mystic forge. That's not exactly cheap.
---
As for why, ascended gear is best in slot, and that answers that question. 
---
Therefore, ascended gear is *not* "easily farmed" in fractals, takes longer and still requires 500 level crafting. Your dismissal of my response that bloodstone, dragonite, etc. will be put to good use in crafting ascended gear is nonsense.
---
Teef means bitch in Dutch.
---
[removed]
---
I imagine he stopped updating because of a loss of interest. Can't blame him...
---
If it was like those flamingos it would actually be good.
---
Staying with your commander is the rule of the game if you're playing wvw and not roaming.
---
Not sure what you guys complaining about there.
---
Whether they will actually have wvw builds is an entirely different matter all together though. 
---
Necro tower is my favorite place in WvW. I wish I could make it my personal instance.
---
General rule of thumb is, Discovery &gt; Crafting and that is mainly a Inscription/Insignia and then two/three of other components.
---
You can even get Crafting EXP boosters from guilds and other boosters to increase the crafting experience gained by everything you do. You can get some in a Guild IIRC:
---
To get some of your money back check what Insignias are account bound and which have the highest value. Get those boosts and start crafting those insignias for undiscovered gear. when you hit 500, sell the rest.
---
Might pick up some mount skins if they drop a bit. I really want the sun gecko springier, but 2,000 gems is just far too much for a single mount skin. Never had any luck when it was in the black lion chests either. 
---
Like others have said, I would try  to  concentrate on what helps you the most in your builds.  I mained a ranger for about the first year I played.  My first  legendary was Bifrost (staff) cause I thought it would be cool for my crappy PvE druid.  I woke up and made Kudzu (longbow) and Chuka (shortbow) next, which had a lot more use.
---
There is a mountain of difference between investing in small pilot projects that you don't continue with, and attempting to diversify for literal years with nothing to show for it and a degrading main product. McDonalds iterates and has new menu items fail all the time, but they still manage to put out something new maybe once a year. Making a game is a whole lot more work than making a sandwich, but the core principle remains. 
---
For god's sake, even SWTOR is still putting out regular content people enjoy and has a more recent expansion.
---
&gt;There's also the issue that everything by initial design is made to be eventually abandoned, there is very few real repeatable content when compared to other MMOs
---
That's been the exact opposite of my experience, GW2 is the only MMO I play where content isn't immediately outdated a few months after release when they release the next wave of gear.
---
&gt;very few things that encourage you to revisit older maps without involving some sort of gold sink.
---
That's the genius of it, though. The fact that GW2 uses it's generic currency as a generic reward and a common sink is what keeps most of the game relevant, at least in some small way. Almost everything you do rewards gold, and almost everything you do requires gold, so running around and clearing events anywhere will slowly progress you towards a goal.
---
This is in contrast to say, FFXIV, where once a piece of content falls out of your level or gear score range, it's functionally useless to you forever unless the developers twist your arm with some artificial carrot. They try to do the same thing, encourage you to play older, outdated content by giving you gear tokens or gold for doing so, but gold isn't valuable in XIV and the gear tokens are on a weekly cap that max after a few hours of play and then you're done for the week.
---
This is beautiful! Love the style and the expression and her character really come out.
---
My issue with dbl is that it is too big and it seems to be designed with PvE in mind. Way too many cliffs, and the distance between towers and keep seems to be double what alpine is.
---
What are you talking about? i'm playing full zerk since 2012 and never had any problems
---
Just look at Age of Camelot, LotRO and/or GW1. Many more examples out there. I think if a community is still active on a game, the game runs. Slower, but it runs.
---
dunno why, but when you used the fiery gs i had vietnam flashbacks about using it for the old old old trick with skill #4
---
I sometimes do play tempest for healing. It's easy to play and very effective at outgoing healing with high survivability.
---
Was that begging for a free commission poorly disguised as a favour to the artist? 
---
...The modern equivalent of ‘you can use it in your portfolio’.  
---
I'm still at your first steps. Bank tab and store + inventory. 
---
Wisely adviced. 
---
Stealing my treasure? And my ship?
---
It truly was an amazing place &lt;3
---
Oh man Fire Elementalist was my favorite! MASSIVE AOE ALL THE TIMES!!
---
yeah, we can't have wvw being popular, that's a no-no
---
Sick strat, nj.
---
It’s part entitlement, part being lazy and part being a dickhead. 
---
Rev. It's full zerk and played at 1200 range. You mostly just have to orbit the tag and never pop in front of it or stand directly on top of it.
---
That's the spirit! Don't Bother with the bad things or shitty player's, at the end you will always learn something and get better! (Y) 
---
Whats the point of having gear at all then? What's the point of progress if you get everything for free?
---
Pvp is a vacuum mode, only one type of content so it makes sense to have a specific gear system. Both wvw and pve are very versatile with content and as such need versatile gear system.
---
As mentioned million times before: exotic gear is easy to get, even if you're playing wvw only.
---
Nope; she's a stub of an unreleased story section, along with the shouted-about-but-never-seen 'Mordrem Snipers' during Dragon's Stand (and the 'second level' of Blighting Pod Racetrack that's *probably* supposed to be used for something other than 'fall in and die from poison regardless of your Masteries')
---
How does supporting give wxp? I thought it was only for kills/tagging?
---
&gt; Good meme and it is true, but many meta WvW blob builds are in full berserker already.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Power Scourge/Reaper
---
&gt; Power Weaver/Tempest (staff)
---
&gt; Power Spellbreaker
---
&gt; Power Herald
---
&gt; Power Soulbeast
---
&gt; Maybe Power Daredevil (heard it is good-ish nowadays)
---
&gt; Maybe some form of Power Chrono with portals etc. utilities and spike damage
---
&gt; Then there is Condi Scourge, which can be full Viper so it is as squishy as full Berserker.
---
How far do I have to fall in the tier list to find the shit blobs that have soulbeasts, thieves and weavers wearing full zerks? How far do I have to fall to find soulbeasts in blobs at all?
---
Can't say more than impressive job guys.
---
You misspelled feature ;) 
---
(/s)
---
If by "menu" you mean looking at the hour long map queues, sure
---
toy shell infusion is the stuff of nightmares
---
From profits they hire new devs to work on other games, not steal devs from GW2 and run it with a skeleton crew.  Think of all the cool stuff they could have done in the past year if they'd had a full team
---
Combine that with trolling tactivators and you could potentially make a fortune.
---
So basically crying for free? Lets give legendaries to all players and call it a day then. I'd also like 40k AP because I dont have time to complete all of them. Throw in some black lion skins because I dont have enough money to buy them.
---
Why do people tie gearing up with grind when you dont even need the highest quality gear to do 99% of the game?
---
material storage expanders are really huge QoL. I've bought them all and wouldn't be mad if they could offer you to buy 4 more after that.
---
Welcome! Just shout if you need help with anything :)
---
As a former WvW player, I'd have to agree partially here.
---
\- I agree that if they ONLY add the claw mount, that would be a slap in the face with spit on it to all WvW players.
---
\- I disagree however with all the other points, WvW has needed changes for years now....
---
I stopped playing exactly because the map meta's and strategies never seemed to change, the builds did from time to time but nothing else.
---
These mounts will force a major shift in how WvW is played, and I for one welcome it.
---
I might even play it again now.
---
\*WE\* are groot?
---
There is, only so many people can play on a map at once. It's not uncommon during busy times like weekly reset to have to queue to enter the game-mode. The rest of the time it's usually not an issue though.
---
Boosted gear is perfectly fine since you dont need a lot of damage to tag enemies.
---
Qadim is such an awesome boss. Tons of different unique phases, lots of mechanics going on at the same time, and plenty of room for different strats to evolve over time
---
That doesn't actually address why PvE should be given balance priority which is the point of this discussion. Feelings on a personal level, though they can suck if you enjoy a certain game mode have no bearing on the foundations of a gamemode's existence.
---
With respect, not providing anything relevant to the topic itself and calling my points nonsense is a pretty good way to shut yourself out of the discussion.
---
Is there any way to make gold? Also tips for solding/salvaging gear. I wanted to make some gold and change it for gems and get season 2 and 3 of living story. My family isn't very wealthy so credit card is no option. 
---
I have HoT and PoF.
---
You should check the not so secret WvW discord...
---
Guardian - Firebrand if you've got either bulky minstrel gear or have geared up a healbrand (you'll be eating damage like no tomorrow because of the toughness and vitality loss from not running minstrel, but you'll be viable for applying boons in the backline which suffers the most from not having stability, aegis, protection etc)
---
Revenant - Herald transitions better from straight PvE with Berserker gear (Marauders would be beneficial to your personal survivability but its not too much of an issue). Scholar runes are okay but you can't expect the HP% based damage modifier from being up very often, you're better off with something like Rage, as you'd want to pop Burst of Strength from Facet of Strength's Second Cast to get that damage boost (and Firebrand generates almost all the might for the group). The bonus damage from the near permanent fury uptime (sleeping on Facet of Darkness, leaving Gaze of Darkness untouched unless you need the stun break). Coalescence of Ruin is your money maker (Hammer 2, can crit for well over 19k, basically 100-0ing someone who's not positioning properly).
---
Elementalist - Either elite spec, you're squishy as fuck regardless so you should just pick the one you have the most confidence in staying alive on (usually this defaults to Tempest for the AoE healings and the nice bonuses from Auras they can output). Run staff and Fire trait all the way across the top (1-1-1) and use Meteor to kill enemy siege your commander and your zerg would appreciate it.
---
Warrior - Spellbreaker. OOF. Basically this class is what I call "Scourge's fifth Sand Shade" (since they can place three unless they trait for using only one shade with a bigger AoE, the Necro themselves act as the fourth), where you just go in and try to deny an area (not much killing potential from their boonstrips unlike before when Winds of Disenchantment was a kill confirm for the zerg). More or less the "zerg thief" where you go in and be annoying in the enemy zerg before you either die, or your zerg takes them out while they've wasted cooldowns on you.
---
[I have no idea what you're talkin bout.](https://imgur.com/a/sB7t3FX)X3

"Stop focusing on my skills but more on what the guy in front of me is doing."
---
That's what my martial arts coach used to tell me. 
---
For me: best friends are these that will tell you the truth or at least what you did not do right from their point of view. Not the ones that tell you only what you want to hear. At least I prefer the 1st type and do not have any of the 2nd. 
---
See it from this side: people were disappointing not because of the mount but because resources were wasted for something no one asked for instead of addressing issues that the community of specific mode think will help this mode to stand stronger. 
---
Polysaturated Reverberating Infusion
---
They are honestly the worst thing you could pick right now, especially with those gear stats which makes them kind of worthless. You cant even tag enemies/support allies with them.
---

What do you mean viper gear doesnt work on my scourge?!?
---
I see a lot of questions asked here that no one can answer besides ArenaNet. Is that just to initiate a discussion, or are actual answers expected? 
---
Did you ask him if he wanted to be trained in VG tanking? Raids are so rude and elitist /s
---
wtf those eyes are half as big as her head
---
I get the hate with deadeye in pvp, but I think if you play so that you are constantly +1ing fights by bursting down targets and moving to the next one then your fulfilling your role.
---
We only Really have 3 dedicated pChronos in the guild, one wasnt available, i was on boon chrono and misha on thief.
---
The other thing is that yes pChrono has good burst but only better burst as long as f5 is off CD
---
I was told the requirements , and I found them believable , but don't have a source , so take with a grain of salt please :
---
WVW level 1200 , 100 gold , 250 ability points
---
The wvw level is the only real barrier to casual acquisition 
---
thank you! forgot about that website 
---
Yeah , the reasoning for the stream cancel would have no effect at all on the patch release. They only announced the patch a week before hand , the chance it isn't ready or will be cancelled is zero.
---
I feel like you completely missed the point of my second statement. 
---
Nowhere did I state that OP should not get the mount. In fact, I effectively said "it changes the new player experience, but that's perfectly okay to do so because mounts make things so much better"
---
dam image you would encounter something like this in an area without light (a shame ante dont utilities them as they should lighing effects with torch locks awsome there )
---
There's also reward tracks you can run for free exotic armor that can select from ANY stat. Good for starting out builds and then swapping in Ascended as you get it.
---
From what I've heard of the requirements , if you're new to WVW you won't be getting the mount anytime soon , OP. Sorry.
---
I really hope its not 100 gold that's going to suck lol. What are your sources? 
---
The skill lags will be amazing in SMC fights
---
I was just playing through the Bitterfrost chapter on an alt yesterday. If it said somewhere that the Icebrood and the Svanir are different things, I missed it; my interpretation was that they exist along a continuum, depending on how badly the corrupted ice had gotten to their brains. Some keep all of their intelligence, some a little of it, some turn into brainless zombies. What did I miss?
---
I love that this is a thing again. You go boys!
---
And when the goose dies, you and your family starve to death. You don't have any other alternatives. But hey, at least you kept the fans of the goose eggs happy.
---
And some guy living in the city, who knows absolutely nothing about ranching, tells you the proper way to run a ranch.
---
Hang on to your gems until you know the game better and know what YOU prioritize over the common suggestions ( copper-fed , mistlock pass , unbreakable tools , bank slots ) . These things are all useful as hell , but are they the right fit for YOU ? Play a bit first and see. Except copper-fed-salvage-o-matic. It is crazy useful , and a must buy.
---
You've forgot your kidneys and 10 years in slavery:-P
---
That's not how commissions work.
---
If your packets are getting intercepted the "personal" (hashed processes executables/file names and hashed injected dlls in this case, lol) information sent via anti cheat should be one of the last of your concerns. Seriously.
---
Don't be shy or sorry for being new to WvW. Smart veterans know that getting players new to WvW is vital for the longevity of the game. I've been playing since release and I've spent 90% of my time there. You are always going to have negative feedback but remember those people are just the vocal minority. Don't get discouraged!
---
Specially considering they had already structured it in semi-maintenance mode.
---
or...no mounts and not leveled glider masteries  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ 
---
Really 1200? I guess no mount for me since... I am not gonna grind the missing 300 levels in WvW. Well maybe if ANET is giving out 200% xp bonus or something. And no mount means not having to buy the next random mount packs.     
---
      
---
Anyways thanks for the info. Legit or not, it definitely helps to keep the hype in check before tomorrow.

GW2 lore and villains in a nutshell.
---
WoW vet of 12 years here, and GW2 has been the \*only\* other MMO to capture my attention. My fiance and I just started playing again after 5 or so years, so we're basically new too :) We just hit 80 and started the HoT stuff. It's fun and challenging and the game itself is just as beautiful as I remember.
---
I am Kyndle.8790 ingame if you want a friend!
---
DBL has massive buggs, you can jump into both left and right castels as Messmer and port 20 ppl with you. 
---
All known bugs none of them fixed 
---
I think that Guild Wars 2 has a real problem when it comes to trivializing content design and pandering to simplicity at the expense of *meaningful* challenge, understanding and achievement.  In my opinion you can't have a meaningful challenge without a gradual progression of learning -- you make mistakes, you learn, you experiment or try again, but this has become abnormal rather than standard. 
---
Characterization of villains in this game has always been horrendous.
---
White Mantle? Handled well?
---
They took Caudecus, an intelligent conspirator working in the shadows for decades, and turned him into a bumbling buffoon.

He's not wrong.  So much of people want on these forums can be boiled down to this: they want to leech or they want content so insanely easy that pressing a single button gives them every reward in the game.  The classic rebuttal to everything around here is "This game isn't a job, I shouldn't have to work to get what I want."  That statement right there is a product of the current mentality of today, entitlement.  People think that just because something is available out there, somewhere they are entitled to have it.  Ummmmm, no you are not.  In the real world, in video games, anywhere you are not entitled to anything...ANYTHING.
---
Games used to be worth playing because they were fun, not because you got shinies or anything.  Games were about fun, about telling a story, about losing yourself in a world.  Today, people just want shiny things they can show off and if the thing they are doing doesn't reward them with something shiny or requires them to actually think critically they complain: "there's no rewards", "this is too hard", "why should XXXXX group get this and we can't"  You aren't entitled to Legendary Armor, you entitled to clear Dhuum, you aren't entitled to ascended gear, you aren't entitled to anything.  Stop being a lazy little \*\*\*t and actually put some effort in.  Jobs are not the only thing in this world that requires effort.  Why read a book?  That requires effort.  Why exercise?  That requires effort.  Why play a sport?  That requires effort.  You know how you get good at baseball or hockey or football?  You practice.  You play the GAME, you learn tricks, you improve yourself and you get better.  But in video GAMES?  Nope, that's too much, need to skip right to the end and have everything so brain dead easy and simple a baby chimp can do it.
---
Zorric is 100% correct here
---
The developers who pushed Mallyx as the revenant legend clearly went for the "biggest guy" and didn't even bother to check the lore.
---
I mean, you're right. Full stop.
---
But that kinda *is* the answer, then. People try the mode when they're first getting into the game, it's unfamiliar, unwelcoming, the existing player base is actively hostile toward them for their lack of knowledge and experience, they die a lot, and most of their experience is waypointing, running across a map, dying, lather, rinse, repeat.
---
It's the opposite of fun, they don't want to be there, and the players there make it abundantly clear they don't want them around either, so they go back to PvE and don't give WvW a second thought again till they are forced back to get a GoB or in this case a mount, and they're about as annoyed to be there as the WvWers are to have them there.
---
Imho, it's just a catch-22 of the mode: new players are more of a liability than an asset until they find their footing, so WvWers generally always want a greater population but don't want new players. They want veterans to magically spring into existence, fully formed, like Athena.
---
In a perfect world, this would result in WvW being known for its robust, welcoming community and willingness to take newbies by the hand to bring them up to speed.
---
In the real world, it's resulted in a cycle of WvW getting ignored because of low population, so they want more population, the new players suck so they antagonize them and they leave, then they're again left with the low population and getting ignored by the devs. This is interrupted occasionally when the devs throw them a bone in the form of something new, which also attracts new blood...who the community in WvW promptly antagonizes, and once they get what they want, they leave again.
---
oh thats great to hear will be prepared :)
---
Twilight Arbor didn't make any sense either. Was it a city they invaded? Their own secret headquarters? Who knows.
---
A teleport from X to Lions arch is 4 Silver? Those access contract are extreme luxury items
---
...wow i’m dumb, definitely didn’t think about it that way lmao
---
I’m used to that tagline popping up on things like the “account jumpstart pack” where it’s on sale because they want new people to buy things right away
---
I guess. I came from GW1, so I was used to the gods, to me it still was really just a "Huh, I guess he is bad now" It never really felt so much a spoiler to other stuff
---
But again, that's me. Everyone is different and is bothered by different things. 
---
I heard from several sources , but yes , I don't guarantee it's correct. BUT they ARE indeed giving a double WVW xp bonus from the 26th to the 5th . So grind out those 300 levels ! :)
---
You need rank 350. That's it.
---
why post other players opinions instead of your own?
---
This is my opinion based on my own preferences and it may not apply to you or anyone else with different preferences. I've been playing for a little over a year. I went for Shining Blade and loved every second!! I am working on Sunrise now and then Flameseeker Prophecies.
---
I used [https://gw2efficiency.com/](https://gw2efficiency.com/) to figure out whether to buy/craft items. For example:
---
1. Shining Blade: https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a\~0!b\~1!c\~0!d\~1-81957 
---
2. Astralaria:  https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/calculator/a\~0!b\~1!c\~0!d\~1-76158 
---
If you enter your API key, it will get the mats you currently own and update the "shopping list" accordingly and then you can export the "shopping list" to Excel and keep track of your progress.
---
Assuming you mean Frostfang and not Astralaria, I would go for Shining Blade if you do not enjoy world completion (gifts of exploration, you get 2), I don't like world completion because of the hearts. 
---
If you mean Astralaria, you should figure out which weapon your toons use the most and I would go for that one. Shining Blade and Astralaria are both gen 2 and do not require world completion but require more mats and more items that cannot be bought, but that didn't bother me because although I prefer to buy gems and convert to gold, I play almost everyday and it wasn't as painful for me to get the items I cannot buy as world completion would be. 
---
I think all gen 2 have a forced collection, Shining Blade forces you to get 2 other swords to get the precursor.
---
FYI: One gold is worth 6 - 7 cents so anything that costs around 330 to 400 gold or less I tend to buy (that's around $25) because I can't play 2+ hours everyday. 
---
WHATEVER YOU DO, START GETTING MYSTIC CLOVERS NOW!! NOW! NOW! The issue is that the mystic forge recipes do not guarantee mystic clovers (you can and will get other mats you don't need), you can't buy them and it will take trial and error to get the 77 you need. 
---
As long as you have the mats, I would collect the mystic clovers every time you login. The wiki says using the 1 clover at a time is "faster" but I don't have the patience so I used the 10 clovers recipe ([https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic\_Clover](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mystic_Clover)) using 10 each of: 
---
1. Obsidian Shards, 
---
2. Mystic Coins, 
---
3. Globs of Ectoplasm 
---
4. and Mystic Crystals. 
---
I play almost everyday so I have a lot of Spirit Shards that I use to buy the Mystic Crystals. The other ingredients I get from playing and I buy the Mystic Coins every now and then.
---
**A good friend told me about the mystic clovers and I didn't listen, then I got frustrated the day I finally had everything but the stupid clovers!**
---
Gift of Battle can be a pain if you don't like wvw, I do so no big deal for me I just selected that track in wvw.
---
When I started I didn't realize I need to have all the HoT and the Legendary Crafting masteries maxed out, which required a large number of HoT and Central Tyria Mastery Points to unlock. 
---
Have fun whichever one you chose and if you have any questions, let me know. I am darthjunius.3165 in game and all my 28 toons (don't ask!) have Darth as the first name.
---
last I checked that's not how opinions work
---
also last I checked sharing someone elses opinion you agree with is expressing an opinion
---
How do you get a cursor like that? I lose track of mine so often it makes me crazy
---
i'm up to 2k now, but higher would be nice too
---
This is insanely impressive, amazing job!
---
Reaper was used as tank back when Rise had no time cap on the minions. The good ole times
---
&gt; also last I checked sharing someone elses opinion you agree with is expressing an opinion
---
last time i checked, OP didnt mention specifically that they agree with everything that was said in that livestream, so their opinion remains unclear.
---
and what gloves are you using?
---
He must be pretty stressed then, his revenue stream might be cut off soon
---
who is wanze?
---
&gt;So please stop trying to make this into some kind of good business decision. It was not.
---
I mean, it *was*. Guild Wars 2 is ArenaNet's only real product and it's over a half decade old in a notoriously fickle market. If the opposite news came out and we learned that ArenaNet had no future projects planned past Guild Wars 2, I think a lot of us would be pretty concerned about the future of the company.
---
It was a good business decision because if they didn't do it they were being blind and stupid, but it was the wrong call because they couldn't keep up the quality of their main product in the absence of developers and now it was all for nothing.
---
That's an autoattack chain with sword mesmer it does 3 hits - 2 slashes and a stab, the third attack which is the stab does increased damage and removes boons (buffs) from the target
---
A/W BB sin....true cancer
---
Honestly a GW2 heroes mode with that system and traditional moba mechanics would have been a nice addition imo and quite doable. 
---
Set builds that allow you to buy utility slots and level the character in play... boom... 
---
Have people playing well known NPCs as an excuse to limit builds. Make it something fun to play and easily accessible and people would come. 
---
What time is on time? Asking for a friend 
---
There is a problem, but that ain't it.
---
Pressing a button and getting everything handed to you is wrong, but so is making it so grindy that people have to play as much as they work to actually get the shinies, that is also wrong !
---
Comparing a video game to real life is so wrong, it borders on stupidity.
---
Press H, go to the second tab which is called 'build' and you'll see the list of weapons your class can use. You'll also be able to see range of the skills when you hover over if you have them unlocked.
---
As you find weapons at that level, equip them and use them for a little while to unlock all of your weapon skills and to figure out what you enjoy. Keep in mind that based on your skill bar (skills 1-5) it will be apparent if your weapon is power or condi damage based and you won't be very effective unless your stats are skewed in that direction from your armor and trinkets.
---
Hope you enjoy the game!
---
A few devs regularly watch the stream and talk in chat, so yes, this is definitely on their radar.
---
if you're roaming, there are plenty of meta roaming builds that run all zerker or a mix of zerker and marauder. the only thing you'll have to change is your runes and probably your traits.
---
Yeah it's also WvW'ers thinking they are somehow above PvE players when the vast majority of them are bad.
---
A minimal increase in the range of 0.2% dps (counting full infusions) for a bunch of power builds.
---
I'm so amused that in the effort of showing what the skill is like you've found probably the oldest screenshot existant showing from even pre-beta of GW2 haha! This makes me feel so old.
---
And dedicated WvW players can tell if you're a bad player, or if you're just bad at WvW. A bad player is actively detrimental to their team. They rally the enemies, waste supply on unimportant objectives, and take up space on a map that could be occupied by a real organized squad.
---
A new (and therefore likely not as good) WvW player that is good at the game though, they can be helpful. If you are honestly interested in being involved in WvW in the future and not just bagging your mount and bailing, find a commander and join comms. Bounce around a bit too. Don't get too attached to one commander. They all run differently.
---
What server are you on? I'm sure there will be people around that would be glad to point you in the direction of a good starting point.
---
MFW wvw lvl 7
---
rude_asura, a full time tp baron 
---
just wait for ran/rit spam 
---
Yeah those are chain auto-attacks on sword. Meaning the attacks will go in order and have slightly different outcome then restart the chain from the beginning.
---
Ok well I'm stating the facts we do have which lead me to believe there is an not an expansion.
---
Source: anet has said we are getting another living world season after this one while in the past, we would typically have an expansion after this season. As to what comes after that, literally no one knows so it's silly to claim the facts point to us getting one. The only facts we have are living world season 5, and the fact is that is not an expansion.
---
"What do you mean when you say that I have to pay? You're getting EXPOSURE in the GW2 subreddit! You should pay me! Your art is shit anyway!" 
---
It's implied
---
What happens if it's a huge hitbox like the qadim legendary creatures?
---
I'm guessing if you're in the middle of the enemy hitbox, in a small hitbox the shockwaves will miss as they spawn outside the small hitbox but in a huge hitbox the shockwaves hit when they travel outwards when spawning in the big hitbox?
---
*-Shrivels way to Dots-*
---
I wanna be a part of this so bad
---
Mesmer greatsword skills 2, 3, and 4 are all 1200 range. Skill 1 is 900 range. Weird? Yep, but not really any weirder than Revenant hammer where every attack has a 1200 range.
---
Other mesmer main weapons: 
---
* Staff = 1200 for all attacks
---
* Scepter = 900 for all attacks
---
* Axe = 130 except skill 3 is 600
---
* Sword = 130 except skill 3 is 600
---
For offhand weapons: 
---
* Sword = 900 and 1200
---
* Focus = 900 and 1200
---
* Shield = 900 and 600
---
* Pistol = 1200
---
* Torch = 240 and 1200
---
So, weapon range for spellcaster classes is weird to say the least.
---
That might be a fair point but as it stands I have so much gold in game that there is zero reason for me to ever pay real money for gems VS converting gold
---
Glad to see my main men Misha finally living up to half of his potential, Snus Crows be carry these elitsts feels good men. 
---
it took me 5 hours with a booster to get mine, iirc the minimum amount of time it requires is 8 hours with no booster, 4 with a booster, but if you aren't a wvw player and you can't find a good commander to follow then those times aren't that realistic. its also way better if you join the discord of whoever is commanding, i did that and i started dying a lot less because i could hear and follow the commanders commands.
---
&gt; Comparing a video game to real life is so wrong, it borders on stupidity.
---
yeah, analogies are just stupid am I right?
---
Looks like minion troops for an incompetent supervillain.
---
Do you have any evidence of what you said? I have been playing wvw since beta, and i have never ever seen anyone complain about old BL being small. I have seen people complaining about spawn camping, and taking too long to reach the keep, but they eventually fixed that in forms of forks and waypoints.
---
I think it's fair to say *this* is how majority of us who were once a PvEr only got converted to WvW.
---
i love lupi
---
Yeah I think the progression is: starting zone, starting city, dynamic events, world boss, Zhaitan fight, Silverwastes, HoT metas...after that you just get salty about everything. 😆
---
So much wrong with this paragraph.  Please stop acting as though you know what's best for everyone.  Not everybody wants a goddamn video game to be a job.  Not everybody has fun grinding the same monotonous content for weeks on end just to make a dent in progress on a legendary.  Why can't you understand that not everyone is YOU?
---
back in pirate ship days? we're still in pirate ship days.
---
they linked specific parts of the video now, so still unsure, if he agrees with the other stuff that was said as well.
---
Exactly, you couldn't have said it better. Its a vicious cycle
---
Why would you want them? Power is always superior to ferocity because ferocity can only multiply the base and the there are no builds that make ferocity a stronger multiplier (for example a trait that doubles ferocity or something to that effect). The only stat that compares to power is precision, but only until you hit the crit cap, after that it becomes worthless. This is why you see lots of assassin gear being used over zerker. You’d never see a meta build with a ferocity primary, power precision secondary, as it would just deal less damage than berserker in every instance (save some trait comping out that multiplied the effect of ferocity). 
---
Analogies are like carrots, they are just stupid.
---
Teapot thinks they COULD to change the meta - fix the balance issues....  but there's no going back. Entropy dictates that the genie can't go back in the lamp! It's too difficult to control balance.
---
A new expac would be the only opportunity to change things on such a wholesale scale, and even then it would involve plonking down something that has to be more powerful that came before or people won't play it. 
---
We're looking at the prospect of level cap increases, and we know how unpopular that idea was (maybe it isn't anymore)...
---
You sounded uneducated about the topic here, the anet team is intact 
---
post is 56m old, the comment with timestamp is 55m old
---
"now" is not really now but whatever fits you
---
&gt;people play mobile games out of boredom and a lack of access to play anything else
---
Nah, I play a lot of mobile games because I enjoy that old school MMO feeling of long term progression that you really don't see in a lot of newer MMOs.
---
Ironically, mobile games, with their need to gate your progression to encourage microtransactions, ended up taking a lot of inspiration from MMOs. There's also a surprisingly large amount of depth to a lot of them, driven by the fact that the games kind of need a certain level of complexity in order to have enough things to sell you. Fire Emblem Heroes is genuinely more complex than any of the main series games with it's insane amount of skill variation, and Dragalia Lost's boss battles are ripped almost straight out of FFXIV.
---
Mobile games aren't just something people do because they have nothing better, they occupy a legitimate niche in the market. I can play every other Fire Emblem game on my phone via emulators, but FEH is still on it too.
---
Neither, all back items suck
---
I see.
---
In PvE, I currently play a sword dagger power weaver. So im already pretty squishy, but I do want to keep playing that style of dodging a ton and a lot of dealing dps (high risk high reward style of play)
---
Tho sometimes I switch to staff power weaver if I find that I need the range. 
---
Haha double XP from the 26th to the 5th or 6th. So grind it out ! But as I said , this is not guaranteed to be correct , although I heard it from several different sources.
---
&gt; We're looking at the prospect of level cap increases, and we know how unpopular that idea was (maybe it isn't anymore)...
---
grinding out new masteries probably takes alot more time than grinding out 30 more levels.
---
yeah man. both are fun. that's what it's all about at the end of the day.
---
Also, since you're new, some other things you may want to know to make life easier.
---
* With no target selected, each of your skills has a thin, red bar at the bottom of it. When you have a target selected, if the target is in range of that skill, the red bar goes away.
---
* Go into Options (F11) and scroll down to turn on "Lock Ground Target at Maximum Skill Range". For example, Greatsword3 is a ground targeted skill. If you move the ground target beyond maximum skill range while you have this option turned on, the target stops at maximum range rather than continuing to follow your cursor. If you move the cursor left/right, the ground target will still move left right, but you'll be able to see exactly what you max range is rather than trying to cast it beyond max range and wondering why it's not working.
---
WvW Veterans: Fuck PvE players, go back to Silverwastes, you're just a rally bot ruining my game mode and filling the queue.
---
Also WvW Veterans: I wish WvW's population was more stable. This game mode is about to die and it's all ArenaNet's fault for neglecting it.
---
literally how hard would it be to make the shockwave effect originate from a single point blank centered around a hitbox
---
And also, why 1200? That seems like such an arbitrary level?
---
I was seeing people peddle this idea in map chat in WvW the other day, and a bunch of gatekeepers praised it because it means they get their mount handed to them Day 1 and they were excited to see PvE players cry/possibly never get it. How blatantly toxic, especially considering they keep crying about Anet not doing anything for "their" gamemode. Toxic gatekeepers have done more damage for any gamemode than Anet has, tbh.
---
Oh, and I stated flatly in map chat that if they're going to do that, maybe a rank reset is in order so we're all starting fresh with a new meta. Same gatekeepers baby-raged over that statement.
---
Which you can resize to be more or less giant... Or any image you want. 
---
&gt; a video game to real life is so wrong
---
But... Why? Comparing to a job is the wrong analogy, I agree, but there *absolutely* are parallels.
---
What if we compared it to, say, hobby sports? They benefit from scheduling, practice, and challenge too.
---
Or a fitness routine? The wisdom is that practice, scheduling, and metered challenge has benefits that outweigh 'just showing up whenevs' in big ways.
---
Games don't *need* to be a job to benefit from personal organization or goal-oriented motivation, I think that's what people are after here.
---
lol Thats a horseshit argument, 
---
 People fail to understand that we already have a lot of challenges in  our daily lives,  I'm convinced people who constantly whine about a lack of adversity in  games are spoiled little brats that never had adversity in real life. 
---
Also hes saying that his subjective opinion of what is considered fun should be imposed on the rest of us.His idea of what is considered a challenge is purely subjective. 
---
No one is saying they are entitled to every single reward in the game. He can take his self important speech at the end as if he thinks he got life figured out.
---
Here is a life lesson:  
---
Dont take life advice from twitch streamers.
---
 Yes, I actually agree that GW2 can bit of a breeze at times but guess what, GW2 isnt the only MMO on the market and it caters to a certain audience.
---
Well maybe he was straight out of HoT? I struggled as a fresh reaper right after HoT came out in Zerker...
---
Check out /r/gw2economy for some sound advice.
---
As others have said, Silverwastes is good. Follow the RIBA rotation and you'll do fine. All you need to do is kill one enemy per defense. Whether you get a copper or gold medal makes no difference on the number of bags you get upon event completion. Always follow your tag in the beginning, don't capture fortresses ahead of them.
---
Real money is made in the market though.
---
I disagree heavily. The resources are extremely hard to find for casual players. This isn’t like WoW where literally everything you need to know is on wowhead.
---
Reaper with 100%crit rate in Valkarie gear
---
omg Marhan's Grotto! So many strange player chats there. The many coloured monks! Memeories. lol
---
You, I like.
---
Elminster.
---
dont count on it
---
That second one sparks joy in me :D 
---
What do you mean people see more to life then getting first place in every category or making all the money in the world!?? 
---
You mean people can be humble and appreciate a simple existence!? 
---
Oh the horror!
---
And balance would be far easier, too. Let people swap between heroes, and you'd have something great there.
---
Fallen must be so happy he got to rifle deadeye in a record!
---
Pro tip, open the hero panel with h (or the shield in the top left). You can find lots of useful info on this panel including what skills you get with each weapon. 
---
Just another plot thread ArenaNet has thrown in the bin for now.
---
Inb4 all the people pointing logical arguments as to why Farren can't be E, just like how they pointed that Sylvari can't be minions of an elder dragon before HoT. 
---
You could achieve pretty much the same with warrior as the guardian without having to spend a trait or rune thanks to the stupid arms race. Just slap "Shake It Off!" on your bar and you are good to go ...
---
On the other hand guardian has easy access to light field + blast finisher for additional cleanses and there is torch 5 although it only removes conditions from other people.
---
I think there is also an engi build that can remove a lot of conditions.
---
I suppose it's impossible to argue otherwise. That would explain why you didn't even try.
---
I agree! And thank you! she did an awsome job.
---
plus back then world completion included wvw maps, which encouraged us to take enemy fortifications and us PvE scrubs to create queues xd I know wvw doesn't like pve players though 
---
&gt; People fail to understand that we already have a lot of challenges in our daily lives
---
I'm sure quite a lot of people understand that. How that's relevant to gaming (and the main issue of this thread) is another matter entirely.
---
I like how you point out that someone has a purely subjective opinion (tautology much, opinions are subjective by definition) that differs from your own, so you insult them because of that.
---
Wont change a thing xD
---
Remember folks kill your friends for they are loot pinatas. 
---
well, do we know if Anet people actually wanted to work on side projects?  
---
Maybe this was a task put on them by NCSoft? Kinda like: Hey, we own you. Work on other stuff than GW2.  
---
My perspective might be off here, but to me it feels like Anet is this awesome little group that put out these two fantastic games (GW 1 and 2), and they were swallowed by this large corporation in Asia that is just trying to squeeze money out of them - resulting in the Quality of Life issues that we are all complaining about...
---
i dont really follow these guys but damn i never expected to listen this stuff here in this subreddit :clap:
---
There is also Thief's Twin Fangs and Ferocious Strikes although Ferocious Strikes only works while target is above 50% HP.
---
Points in common with high level fractals/raids: you're going to get murked in about 0.001 seconds if you join in sub-par gear and don't do a little research before starting
---
Some challenges add to stress, other challenges detract from it.
---
Do you or have you ever played in a league sport as a hobby? Or set a fitness goal for yourself that you've executed on? That's the kind of challenge a game should be. Comparing to a job is a bad move, that I agree people ought to stop, but there is positive challenge available in life and outside of video games.
---
The argument for removing barriers or difficulty in games perhaps should be lined up more with the (failing) idea of going to the gym to lift weights, but having the weights only appear to be heavy.
---
PLEASE tell me you're joking.
---
While I don't find you speculation that the announcement of S5 without any announcement of Expac3 overly unplausible it does not make it less of a speculation. My original issue however was not even at you stating such an assumption, but stating the plan to never have another Expac as fact. This is unsubstantiated and Jessica's tweets that I am fully aware of do not make that claim either.
---
The fact that ANet did not release all GW1content in the form that was - at one point - planned does not imply that they would just drop everything the moment something new comes along. There are multiple problems with this reading of what happens. For one: utopia wasn't simply scrapped. During development some of the intended features turned out to be of a larger scope than a standalone GW1 campaign could deliver. These features were (partly) repurposed into gw2 and EotN. Those things happen in game development and they are not necessarily a bad thing.
---
The fact that they never got around to the joko campaign of beyond is more a testiment to their ambition to bridge the gap between the games. The fact that this turned out to take more time then anticipated (similar to the novel) is neither unusual nor should it be held over their heads indefinitely. The later behavior brings us to the frustrating communication policy we have now. 
---
I'm at work and really shouldn't watch video, anyone got a quick tl;dr? Otherwise I guess I could look at it in 4 hours.
---
Honestly I feel like what current WvWers want and what people who are interested in the mode but don't currently play it want are wildly different. I'm in the latter camp and IMO objective play is way more interesting than open field zerg fights. The most fun I've had in the mode is assaulting or defending towers. It just feels like a huge waste if I spend 15 minutes following a commander around, get into a field fight, die, and spend 5 minutes just trying to catch up.
---
&gt;  How that's relevant to gaming (and the main issue of this thread) is another matter entirely. 
---
Because life effects what we want out of our entertainment? What kind of question is this? 
---
&gt; I like how you point out that someone has a purely subjective opinion  (tautology much, opinions are subjective by definition) that differs  from your own, so you insult them because of that. 
---
Hey big brain, I'm not saying his wrong for having a different. Im not against people wanting a challenge. Im saying he wants to impose his nebulous standards of difficulty on the rest of the players. 
---
I believe so too
---
[I disagree](https://imgur.com/a/6pV14mc)
---
Glad to hear it!
---
Hope you are still enjoying yourself in-game, It sounds like you're doing it already but I'd advise taking your time as much as possible - if you can find groups for Dungeons that'd be awesome too and defo try to finish the Personal Story (it isn't up to par with the quality of story from a couple years later but is definitely worth experiencing before diving into newer story)
---
No matter the kind of content you are interested in there are usually people around doing it and we are six and half years in so I'd say the community both in size and presence is good not to mention most folks are friendly and as with your experience already are willing to help/answer questions.
---
Have fun!
---
That is not just Frost Trolls in BFF. That is Frost Trolls everywhere since the game's release. 
---
IIRC You can't stun break out of it but stability will prevent it and I think the autostunbreak traits will also prevent it.
---
As for whether not it is a bug. Either the designer was ahead of their time or it's a cancer that has spread to the rest of the game because they have added more CC like things where stunbreaks and  stability are useless.
---
I've been wondering this intensely for ages now. They seem to have a lot of pull, resources, and knowledge. I wonder if we'll figure out the answer to this mystery in the next episode -- it would make for a fantastic cliffhanger if E revealed themselves and showed us the path forward in the next season.
---
&gt; and giggles
---
...and giggles and giggles and giggles and giggles and giggles and giggles. It'll be hilarious.
---
But wait, there's a thief back there!  Let me just chase for a few seconds...
---
&gt; Yes, you are. Saying "piss off" or calling an argument horseshit are pretty insulting. In my opinion. 
---
I only hate that argument because it puts the blame on the consumer rather then the devs. 
---
"Its the 'casuals' fault! They want Anet to cater to them 24/7!" 
---
Yet this is Anet's intention from the start. You introduce assist/accessibility modes/easier challenges because you want as many people as possible to buy your product essentially. 
---
Where do these guys draw the line at what is considered *easy* for accessibility or just "entitlement."
---
I surely don't want them being the arbiter of that either.
---
&gt; they want people to play more WvW
---
Exactly correct. They want to people to actually *play* WvW rather than show up, quickly grab the mount, and then leave.
---
There are many rekts in this game, but a 30 second rekt is the best : )
---

Haha, thief is the worst to chase
---
Yes E who has been guiding us sometimes through loving world stories mostly via letters. 
---
Power Weaver is a thing.  I hope nobody actually uses full zerker though.  I'll give you a pass and assume you're just talking about power in general.
---
Viper Scourge though?  No...just no.
---
How do you unlock certain Black Lion Weapon Collections? I have about 4 from different collections and I have never spent a Claim Ticket on a weapon, so I am not sure where they came from. 
---
Killing people in a PvP environment?  It's literally just playing the game.
---
Welcome to the wonderful world of dropped, dead plot points. If you look to your left you'll see Malyck.
---
That's kinda the point.
---
oh, so like our ~~stalker~~herald 2.0 
---
Since he asked for a better cleanser than necro, which can get rid of every Condi at once with one signet too, I guessed he looked for something with more skills cleansing rather than one big cleanse it all ;) 
---
that's why you dodge roll friend.
---
After I barely "scanned" the title a little I thought it was CoF speedrun.
---
Obviously life affects what kind of games we enjoy, but it affects us all in different ways, which should also be obvious. It doesn't take a person that struggles with their job or studies to appreciate various levels of difficulty in games. On the other hand I know plenty of such players who enjoy daily grind in Warframe or painful speedruns in Fromsoft games. People complain about lack of difficulty, you tell them all to grow up as if they were all spoiled brats - it's pretty damn hillarious, but also petty and insulting.
---
&gt; I'm convinced people who constantly whine about a lack of adversity in games are spoiled little brats that never had adversity in real life. (...) He can take his self important speech at the end as if he thinks he got life figured out and piss off.
---
My big brain tells me that you pretty much insulted Teapot and many other people for having a specific kind of opinion. I don't even think you understand what he said in the podcast.
---
I wondered why no expansion after Season 4. Now I guess we know why.
---
I’m debating on transferring back to Mag for the link, or moving to my WvW guilds server... for the second time. 
---
Before I transferred the last time, map chat was less toxic. It’s much easier to play when Boars isn’t filling chat with cancer. I do miss those occasional Xushin K-Trains though.
---
Any idea where COOK went? 
---
I reported tons of male charr with female voicelines and female charr with male voicelines. I provided screenshots and where on the map they are located. This has probably been assigned as low priority, but one day it'll hopefully be fixed.
---
Again I think you are missing the point, this thread would have been better if you didn’t comment at all, that’s why you got downvoted 
---
it's a different effect that doesn't interact with the CC system.
---
there are similar effects elsewhere in the game, like various spider bosses that trap you in cocoons
---
it was honestly so on point, the reason we dislike wvw is that it's 99% running followed by running from a zerg
---
It doesn't make a lot of sense for ANet to keep the devs on the same project for 12 years. If you've got so many seasoned developers under your belt, why would you build a new project with none of that expertise? How do you maintain a consistent direction and quality if all of the developers on your second project are new? Also, devs are people, and not everyone is willing to work on the same project for 12 years. I would assume most ANet veterans would jump at the chance to work on a new project.
---
The second one feels A LOT like wvw, yeah :D
---
I'll push back on this by saying: Then ANet did not adequately communicate the intent of their game.
---
That began with the entire Manifesto approach. "Play Your Way" was a brilliant marketing gimmick that people took very very seriously, and it's heavily divided the community ever since.
---
To the point where what we have is basically gym-goer rivalries between the "Truly Dedicated" (elitists) who are there to Get Gains, and the "Weekend Workouts" who are there for any of a dozen reasons, from avoiding injury due to age through wanting to impress their romantic prospects, and everything in between.
---
The problem with this whole discussion I think is that games developers never seem to set themselves up as facilities - the gym doesn't care who you're there to impress! - and always set themselves up more like leagues in professional sports.
---
It's really hard to split the difference between a hands off "Do what you will" approach and a much more structured "eSports, get it here" one, and a **LOT** of companies fail at it.
---
But the community is also failing itself by not respecting the content design, and insisting on arguing only for their own usage case of the facility that is the game.
---
So no one wins, but both sides should still present their case, because it's valuable to do so.
---
The entitled ones won this battle.  Instead of playing the game like us, they complained about it and got what they wanted, a super watered down mmo genre that has been falling apart for the last decade.
---
What’s even scarier is reading these comments and people defending the actions of these types of people.  
---
You realize there are WvW guilds who often hold private raids?  They comp their group out to have just the right balance of support and damage to kill groups much larger than them.  
---
I'm using the same links. Just tried it right now. It just keeps rotating while saying Loading.
---
Berserkers, Vipers, Harriers, Diviners, Minstrels generally.  
---
Technically you can kill a boss w/ just about anything so long as you have decent damage and the group has a solid understanding of the mechanics.  So I'm just going to guess you meant optimal in which case these are the main ones (power dps, condition dps, support builds, dps/support builds and pure tank/supports for toughness tank bosses).   
---
Just take a peek at http://www.snowcrows.com for builds.  There's a little more variety, but that's the gist of it. 
---
For me it won't be purely gw2 performance but it would be for my wife. I'll look at your processor suggestions. The $50 won't be a big deal. The 590 is priced about the same as the previous video card (when I bought it) so it should be fine.
---
I've actually been bouncing a bit on the processor. Any of the ryzen chips are an upgrade. I do a lot of multi tasking so multi core performance is more important to me. I'll double check everything again, thanks for the input.
---
Man i forgot about that video. Love it!
---
Wow truly hyper detailed, my poor pc even crashed for a moment xD  
---
I loved the details, its a masterpiece! You r so talented! (=
---
It takes really long to get anywhere, the keep and garri lords are kinda OP compared to alpine maps.  It can be confusing if you don't know the map.  Also the fact that it is so unpopular makes it even less popular...if that makes any sense.  People don't want to go there because they think it will be empty.
---
The map has its problems, but I find the open-field terrain to be really fun to have fights on.  Shame they are so rare though.
---
#TOPKEK
---
I'd rather not go Intel just because I don't agree with their business practices. The loss in performance is not steep enough for me to change my mind on that.
---
Thank you for the input.
---
&gt; and the community are justified in any criticism. 
---
Hell of a stance to take.
---
Colin understood that people wouldn't buy into this game if they didn't have a sense of what they were getting. He may have been too ambitious but I think he understood how to keep people excited for the future of the game. PoF was the absolute healthiest this game has felt, and I thought that was a turning point in terms of Anets ability to truly make this game in their vision. But now THEY have been acting like that was the great big climax and now we're just riding the resolution til they close the book. If they want to use a symptom of their own lack of communication to justify abandoning their game then that's their prerogative but either way you slice, its only their own decisions that will kill this game before people want it to be killed. 
---
can’t wait for endless queues with no tags!
---
Then i'd suggest a Ryzen 5 2600X, or wait for a third gen. 
---
Technically almost anything is viable, but in terms of optimal:
---
Condi DPS exlusively use Viper stats (unless I've missed something)
---
Power DPS will generally use Berserker stats, with some Assassin's depending on class. Classes that overcap on crit chance could run Valkyrie stats on a few pieces.
---
Boon support Classes (chronomancer, firebrand, renegade) will generally use some mix of Diviner stats and the same stats as a DPS.
---
Healers will generally use Harrier gear if they require boon duration, and some mix of healing power stats - this will vary class by class but would usually be magi or clerics.
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
Boon supports and healers have a lot more flexibility in their exact gearing setup.
---
And now they are likely working on different projects .. maybe tencent bought them exactly for that? Did those 130 employees came from before tencent? 
---
Gw2 seemed to be the only game on the table up till now .. 7 years later ... 
---
Ascended armor isn't that important for WvW. Get weapons first and replace your armor slowly.
---
Just a note so you're not taken completely by surprise tomorrow. It's highly likely that the Warclaw is going to have a WvW rank restriction to obtain it and it's believed that restriction will be rank 1200. If you really get into it, you'll need to play WvW for at least 6 months to obtain that rank. Realistically, it'll be more like a year or two of playing.
---
More than one person play WvW.  Shocking I know.  They often have different attitudes and opinions too.  Just like a real game mode!
---
C A L L O U T S O N L Y
---
I thought it was A/E? Outside of Rata Sum in whatever that map was called lol. Didn't you use mist form to gather?
---
Wait..I think that got nerfed.
---
IDK...GW1 was so long ago :(
---
Weapon unlocks from BL chests? 
---
&gt; But the community is also failing itself by not respecting the content  design, and insisting on arguing only for their own usage case of the  facility that is the game. 
---
Anet created the situation in the first place. This is why there was a subset of the community that didnt want Raids in the game. They specifically left other MMOs to escape the raiding scene. 
---
Im not saying kick out the raiders Im just saying Anet made their bed and now they gotta lie in it. 
---
The community may not be 100% right on everything but its ultimately up to Anet to decide what they do/dont do with their game
---
That's one of those things that I doubt even Anet employees at the time would have a concrete answer for. But NC were still the ones with the final say as publisher, and since Utopia was already a year along when Anet had been aiming for 6-month cadences, it seems pretty likely.
---
Your description of warrior makes me mad. But I don't disagree.
---
I didn't recall the HP in HoT being all that hard. Maybe it was due to higher traffic around the time I played through it.
---
Guild Wars was released in April of 2005. The servers are still up, still 100% functional, and still being played every day.
---
Can't you just have easy mode for the casuals and leeches (really don't like using that word) with less rewards (a little bit less since casuals are more reward focused) and hard mode for the elitists who want to spend more time on the game and probably do it for more than rewards (give them prestige rewards like unique titles for hardcore stuff since they'll care more about that). 
---
There are quite a few people who think legendary armor shouldn't be behind raids. The same people usually are the ones who claim they don't have the time to raid.
---
And that's fine. Just like the fact that if you don't thing x, you don't get the shiny.
---
The point is that these people can find multiple games that give them exactly what they want with a swish of their credit card. Why should game  Guild Wars specifically abide their will?
---
&gt; And now they are likely working on different projects
---
they arent, their output is way too high for that and the roadmap of poe doesnt see an end, the game is still growing.
---
&gt;Did those 130 employees came from before tencent?
---
yes
---
I have sometimes really problems with the mai trin boss fractal, so you might have to test this one out.
---
last hype for wvw lasted 1 week.
---
why would Malyck want Kasmeer to be protected? :D 
---
I think E is actually Anise. 
---
That nostalgia
---
The level of cringe I was not expecting blasted me in the face. Loved it though, take your upvote.
---
M’rage
---
I specifically remember when legendary armor was announced there was a large vocal contingent that was upset the armor wasn't available in open world or story modes and were heavily against locking content behind one particular game mode ("I want to get it playing how I want"). 
---
Ascended gear had to be updated and integrated for free into the fractal system to get people to make it &amp; play the mode. It was put into more collections with HoT to make getting ascended weapons much easier, etc. Compared to what Ascended was when the game launched, a goal to work toward that wasn't required, they throw so much of it at you like candy nowadays.
---
I think that was a little joke by a mischievous dev.
---
If you remember, that skill goes like this:
---
* The troll cowers and appears to channel something.
---
* The ice blast explodes after a few  seconds.
---
Well, that's not what's happening. The troll is quite literally trolling you.
---
The cower animation isn't tied to the skill channeling. The skill has no activation time. As soon as the troll starts to cower, the skill has already been cast. 3 seconds after that the explosion will still appear regardless of you interrupting the troll or not.
---
Each troll creature has its own way to troll players:
---
* Cave trolls trolls by dropping aoes right on top of you that will knock you down. As soon as the red circle appears, interrupting them won't stop the rock fall.
---
 * Deep cave trolls have a way worse version, and will leap at you and also knock down. 
---
* Jungle trolls troll by going invisible and healing. They can't be revealed and interrupting them won't stop the healing.
---
* Ice/Snow trolls will cower and fake channeling a skill after they have already started the skill, and the ice blast will happen whether you interrupt them or not. 
---
stay on tag or die

If you want non-challenging, go read a book or watch a movie - you can even skip to the end if you all you want is the ending. GW2 has a couple of good books to enjoy. If you want to play a non-challenging game, those exist; open world in GW2 exists. There is push back when the non-challenging crowd try to force changes to stuff that is meant to be challenging and downgrade it for themselves instead of seeking something else out on their level. Every one has their own level and easy mode is not a bad thing. But not all things are supposed to have an easy mode.
---
Games are an interactive media. Getting from point A to B is supposed to be the fun and, unlike other media, getting to point B is NOT assured. That is where the satisfaction comes - from overcoming that challenge yourself. By making an easy mode, it hamstrings the perseverence that would otherwise inspire improvement.
---
thanks everybody bookmarked the mentioned pages
---
I see your point - if a game lacks content that is challenging or otherwise time-consuming, it has no longevity and ultimately doesn’t stay engaging.  I agree with that. 
---
However, I also agree with the counterpoint raised here - possibly best summarized as ‘it’s just a game, and I have more important things in my life to worry about.’  As a 30-something with a career and a kid, I sympathize with this one pretty strongly, as games aren’t where I get my challenging life experiences from - they’re what I use to unwind from those challenging life experiences.
---
Obviously, you need both casual and hardcore content to sustain a game this size, as you need to appeal to many different types of players.  What the debate comes down to, then, is what rewards it is reasonable to reserve for only the hardcore players as a reward for their skill and dedication, and what rewards it is reasonable to make available to any player who makes a reasonable time investment.  In fact, even the term ‘reasonable’ is heavily subjective in this context.  Given all this, it’s not even about what type of player is more ‘toxic’, so much as simply: where do we draw that line?
---
\&gt; but so is making it so grindy that people have to play as much as they work to actually get the shinies, that is also wrong ! 
---
It's not objectively wrong. You and many others might not like the design decision but it's not "wrong".  You always have the power not to play the content or hell, the game,  just like they have the power to make their own game however they want.
---
To be fair, all signs point to ArenaNet pulling the "sylvari are mordrem" plot out of their asses. It never made sense in the first place, and it still doesn't.
---
GW2's storytelling in a nutshell.
---
It's a Mr. E.
---
I disagree on your 2nd title. I played fractals for years, literally every day, and Ben's push to make them into raid training pushed me into not playing them anymore. As a pug player I could no longer carry mouth breathers and it totally killed my enjoyment of the game mode. The potential heartache was no longer worth the reward and I really only come back for living world now.
---
Personally I'd like to see challenging solo content that's fun to do more than any more group content where you're at the mercy of your teammates.
---
Does anyone not have stacks of tomes at this point? 
---
Because I'm already sitting at 4k power and I'm only within a few percentage points of self capping Ferocity at 300%. It's an OCD thing. 
---
Yeah, the only part of the gryphon I considered 'grindy' was the 250g part. The rest of that is actually playing the game towards a semi-long term goal.
---
The biggest problem I have with this whole stream is the fallacy that difficulty equals repeatability. Why do the HoT metas still work even years later? It's not because they are hard, it's because they have exclusive rewards *and* because they are accessible to everyone on the map at the time. It takes cooperation, but not so much that a map full of randoms can't pull it off with relative simplicity. Those exclusive rewards are independent of the infusions, too - they can be worked towards. Goals that can be worked towards are the only way GW2 has to simulate vertical progression, random loot drops don't make content repeatable - but they *can* help. 
---
Legendary skins make content repeatable because they are goals to work towards, not drops to gamble your time for. You can log in and make actual progress each day, and see that progress happen - equating that progress with the nebulous, unquantifiable, and unreliable progress one makes while practicing content (and in the case of raids, earning nothing for failure) is disingenuous at best. Practice is not its own reward if the place it gets you to isn't worth the time you've invested. The answer to making content repeatable is not making the content a brick wall to beat your head into until it falls over - that's not meaningful difficulty. In my opinion, raids should be about the fight mechanics before everything else. A group of 10 naked players with nothing but grey weapons should be able to take down the boss if they all play perfectly, and for a long, long fight - there's a reason Souls games are lauded for their implementation of difficulty. DPS checks and timers are arbitrary statements by the designers of the fight that you *can't* do X, not that you must do Y. Players will gravitate towards Y if it's easier *always*, but 
---
Meaningful difficulty is cerebral. It's a puzzle you solve and then overcome. A hard barrier of a DPS check, a timer, or, for another example, blind jumps in a JP, does not constitute meaningful difficulty. There's no puzzle to solve, no compelling obstacle to overcome through perseverance and skill - it's just trial and error. The fact that DPS rotations exist is a testament to poor game design, not an innovative community - it means the skills have so little impact that it's more important to press the buttons in a certain order than it is to know what the skills are, how they work and interact, and most importantly how to treat them as a toolset. DPS rotations treat skills as number generators, not tools - and when you boil them down, most skills in this game are merely number generators.
---
Games must balance what some see as two opposing philosophies - the importance of personal achievement vs the accessibility to a large number of players. During the stream one of them said "who's making the thief montages" - who's watching them? Who, outside of the insular existing PvP and WvW populations, even cares? Not the majority of the playerbase, whether you think their disinterest is entitled or not. In GW2 we have systems with completely different design philosophies all competing with each other for the same playerbase - ANet knows this, and knows that high rewards in one mode will draw from the others - but instead of balancing around all modes being appealing to participate in, they've balanced rewards around none of the modes being *too* appealing to participate in, essentially making none of the content that doesn't have exclusive rewards worth participating in.
---
Another thing that makes this more complicated: learning. Is it the player's fault that the game *never* tells you what that blue bar does? Is it the player's fault that a player has no place ingame to learn the mechanics of raids outside of their singular difficulty mode? Fractals are brilliant because they lead up to the high end, and you learn along the way. HoT metas work, in large part, because the maps and story before them have worked you up to a level that you can contribute to them. With the content like PvP, WvW, and raids, there's no build up, no effort by the game to actually teach players what's going on. And I'm not talking about a quick blurb when you load into the map the first time and never again - I'm talking actual demonstrations of mechanics and how to interact with them, ala the dodge circles in every starter map. Only then, I think, will those modes finally be accessible enough for reasonable new players. Bottom line, accessibility is not an entitlement issue. Being thrown into the ocean without being taught how to swim, just because some people in another boat happen to be willing to throw out some life preservers and teach all the people dying in the water, is an accessibility issue. The difficulty of swimming isn't at fault, and the drowning people aren't at fault - the people who threw them overboard without so much as showing them a kiddie pool are, IMO at fault.
---
Gimme!
---
But they aren't the only ones creating games. Expectations are set by other game developers they have no impact on, and by community 'leaders' (though unofficial) such as the ones in the video here.
---
Both parties participate in the problems the community is facing, it's very difficult to say who's at fault, when there isn't necessarily a fault to be at.
---
Fun fact: "Deep freeze" from Bitterfrost Frontier was probably a test  *mount*.
---
But sometimes tags don't want all the rally bots.
---
&gt; I personally want to see this game make it past 10 years with a third expansion
---
Prove that by continuing to spend if and when they release items of value to you. That's the only way forward.

The soulbeast condi is great in PvE and long fights, as damage is over time and it gets crazy I love it.
---
Never tried it in PvP or WvW , but my guess in WvW would be great against NPCs. Against players it a hit and miss as they might have condi cleanse utility and it won’t be as effective as you want.
---
You can certainly manage in less time, in particular when you don't run to the absolute corner of the map (my estimation was form green spawn to wyvern camp). I also didn't want to assume a specific roaming friendly build, i wasn't assuming more than the standard 25% speedbuff and a few blinks.
---
The irony.
---
&gt; what rewards it is reasonable to reserve [and for what kinds of investment]
---
This, I believe, is absolutely the key point. Eventually, in some games, all rewards can be had as time passes - people solo old content in vertical games all the time to go back and get them; as such the prestige is not access alone, but *first and relevant* access.
---
It's one of the deepest, most crucial failings in ANet's strategy, imo, that they put so much of the game's reward structure on time-against-reward, with very very little in terms of sunsetting that effort.
---
&gt; Really all I want is to say to Anet that the players deserve more than just one more season of content for all the years of effort that have gone into this game and its story.
---
You paid for a game, got it, played it. All the rest is bonus until there's another expac. Until then you don't ''deserve'' shit.
---
To come out like this (after it was literally annouced 2 working days ago that up to 1/3rd of their team would be let go) demanding stuff is such a douchy attitude... Grow up. 
---
You're making some assumptions there that are probably not correct. 200-250 is around the size of the team on other mmos. Anet probably would have had close to that on GW2 even with the other projects given their total staff was 400.
---
no, I'm implying the specific stuff you listed sounds exactly like a game that is a grind.
---
Something like that isn't that new.
---
Basilisk venom from thieves and Deep Freeze from the elementalis frost bow do the same. Freeze the character in place, and give them a transformation. 
---
This just gives you a skill to free yourself, which isn't new either, since the champion toxic spider from Kessex and season 2 already did that too.
---
But elementalist deep freeze and the spider cocoon together, and you get the bitterfrost deep freeze. 
---
And if you can't solo them, there will almost be somebody on the map who will help you 
---
Deep Freeze and Basilisk Venom aren't transformations.
---
Yes you need to buy 4 gifts 1 from the itzel 1 from the exalted 1 from the nuhoch and 1 from miyani at the forge, but they won't let you buy them until you obtained the final mastery in their respective line. That said, once you do have them all, gen 2 is less effort than gen 1 imo. It took me only 2-3 weeks iirc to go from basic gliding to having all 4 lines completed. Now with mounts, it's probably easier and faster
---
I think this is the best explanation I've seen about the problems with DBL. Good job.
---
Ok, now we can panic. 
---
What is this about?
---
Well this pretty much murders any chance of the rest of SAB being completed which is very much a GW2 thing. Admittedly the chances weren't high to begin with.
---
I'll do you one better: You don't even have to be a paying customer to criticise all day long. It doesn't mean that I will take it serious if your criticism doesn't have any merit. 
---
Having the right to criticise != the criticism being justified independent of what it actually states.
---
Yes its an incredible loss, wisdom wise and team wise as he wasnt only a fan favorite but also a team favorite (from his coworkers twitters). Still jumping to any conclusions including badmouthing is an absolute scum thing to do right now. 
---
It's unknown what he worked on recently, but he made a lot of map related content for PoF, such as terrain that's difficult, but fun to navigate with mounts to reach some hidden POIs and stuff like that. 
---
splinter barrage? 
---
This is devastating. Regardless of what his current projects were prior to this, he was objectively one of the best environmental artists this game has ever seen or will ever see again. If they're dropping people of his caliber instead of reassigning them back to GW2, I can only imagine what other huge talent they're losing as a company.
---
&gt; As if being able to open the outer of a keep without being under permanent siege means it's not overly defensive. Casually ignoring inner, lords and supply flow across the map.
---
In inverse order:
---
1. Supply flow is radically more constrained on DBL than it is on Alpine because of how the yaks have to visit the various towers in cycle rather than simply fanning out. I imagine this was an intentional choice, since it means that it's relatively easy to supply-starve things, particularly keeps.
---
2. Lords are cancer only for people who don't know what they're doing. Air lord is definitely annoying if you're trying to fight under it, but a set of well coordinated groups can easily fight under fire or stone lord (I've been in ZvZs under those lords many many times, on both sides). Even air lord can be killed pretty easily on T2 with 3 people (done this as well, multiple times with different classes; I've never had a chance to try it on T3 though). I'm going to go ahead and blame the WvW scrubs who don't know how PvE works.
---
3. Inner on all three keeps is radically less defensible than it is on Alpine. For air keep you have the cata spot, which is defensible only if you build three shield generators, but those generators can in turn get cata'd, so it's like… not really a solution. For fire keep, the gates and inner walls are quite difficult to cover with ACs without being extremely exposed to pulls. Stone has the most defensible inner, but even that is relatively easy to overwhelm, particularly since you can cut off supply and reinforcements so easily.
---
&gt; It's overly defensive. It doesn't matter if your group is 20 or 50 players, because you will not get meaningful fights.
---
It's overly *objective-oriented*. Ironically it's the opposite problem of what you're claiming, though with exactly the results you describe. The fact that you can't get open field fights on DBL is *manifestly* true and only a fool would claim otherwise. The only question is *why* is this true. What I'm saying is that DBL is a much more objective-heavy map with convoluted pathing and very little interaction between the objectives *aside* from the supply impact of the north towers.
---
The fact that it's an objective-heavy map makes the already-overtuned nature of tier 3 become downright oppressive. The fact that interactions are limited to yak pathing produces a highly dull "starve the objective" meta, which naturally favors roamers and bores zergs. The fact that the pathing is terrible makes it very difficult for even willing zergs to *find* one another, much less engage in meaningful fighting without cancer chokes or auras/siege mucking it up, and also proportionally favors havoc.

So I agree with the *state* of the map in terms of what actually happens on it: i.e. mostly extreme boredom for large organized WvW groups. What I disagree with is *why* this happens. It's not overly defensive. Flipping tier 3 is quite a bit easier and more direct on every DBL keep (but especially the non-Air ones) than it is with any keep on Alpine. It's just that you won't get decent fights out of it, so… why bother?
---
Subreddit subscriber amount. Just rolled over.
---
Oh no. ._.
---
so why do **I** have to deal with **your** irl problems in "my" game?
---
First Peter Fries, and now Josh Foreman - the greatest ANet duo are gone! :'(
---
Now we will never know [what the deal is with the guy in the floating castle.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imSXl2a6wUE)
---
TBH I'm inclined to agree with him. The old maps were wide open spaces that offered incredible views and invited exploration and running around. I haven't enjoyed the "more modern" maps quite as much. I was also a massive fan of jumping puzzles and a lot of his work gave me hours of frustration and ultimately a sense of achievement. 
---
The same with [Matthew Medina](https://twitter.com/barefootmatthew/status/1100124443727122432), [Aaron Linde (although seemingly by choice](https://twitter.com/aaronlinde/status/1100089490356355073) and [three people from the audio team (unknown who)](https://twitter.com/maclainediemer/status/1100130536666816514). 
---
I actually had hopes, since they touched SAB physic engine mechanics plenty in the last months and IIRC a few chatcodes popped up some releases ago. All we have left is to wait and see..
---
It won't get fixed *regardless* of whether people drop a bug report.
---
not josh, but medina was definitely working on gw2 and he got fired too.
---
&gt; we just lost any future hope for Malyck's story
---
was there ever any hope for that? Seems like that would have been something that would have gotten retcon away if not for the fact that they would have to pay for re-recording of some dialogs.
---
not josh =( take chris cleary.. gaile gray.. but not josh
---
What official statement? The layoffs or was there one after that I'm not aware of?
---
&gt; "We can confirm that due to the cancellation of unannounced projects, ArenaNet will make staff reductions," the statement reads. "This is part of a larger organizational restructuring within NCSOFT in the west, but the Guild Wars and Guild Wars 2 game services will not be affected, nor is any upcoming game content canceled." 
---
That's a statement from A-net according to this article.
---
[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-02-21-arenanet-reportedly-bracing-for-mass-layoffs](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-02-21-arenanet-reportedly-bracing-for-mass-layoffs)
---
I'm so sad. ;.;
---
Oh, I so hate that Halloween tower. Almost broke my keyboard from smashing it in anger and still never completed it.
---
I have the 2 builds, and i rotate beetween at weekly basis or based in my needs.  
---
Condi Dps: now condi is not the one to go stat that was like 2 years ago, is not needed a lot en Fractals and WvW, so i have to speak in terms of Open World. Compared with Power, its has more survability. I think  is more flexible depending on situations.  With this build you can easily solo some content without problems, also i think its very useful to master the Shortbow, Combos and Traps. Also in my experience this builds lack a bit in CC. Sometimes when i need to solo, for examples Bountys, I prefer changing to Condi Druid to get a bit more of sustain but still doing damage.
---
Power Dps (Power dps Fractal) . You´re are going to be more fragile, but you are going to do a lot more Damage. You can simply oneshots mobs with the first three opening skills, the problem is when you cannot oneshot things and have to master the skills. Sword its a must to a ranger to master, especially the number 2 mechanic to escape, 4-5 skills of Axe to. I dont like to much the Greatsword in its mechanics but its number 1 dps weapon rangers have.  If you need more survability at beggining you can use Marauder Gear at first. With this build you have to be at melee range like 90% of the time to do damage and i dont recomend changing to Longbow for range, at least not in openworld.   
---
If your are runing Soulbeast, remember that the mechanic its that we can fused and unfused with the pet. The number 1 mistake i saw its rangers that they(we) stay fused all the time or forgot to merge with it some times. 
---
NOT THE AUDIO TEAM! God damnit
---
This is a damn shame man, he will be missed :(
---
Josh was active directly with PoF and current events. The fact tha Methew Medina got laid off means that gw2 services and development are going to be affected, contrary to the lie anet posted last week. Mathew was even a guest during LW release streams. So these are people directly connected to gw2 development.
---
Anet took our money, burnt their projects and now they are going to close the game. Nice.
---
It gets old though...all I ever did in WvW was waypoint, run, get one-shotted...lather, rinse, repeat.
---
I mean if you're working on new projects you people your best people on them. Josh hasn't made any JPs in years so it was quite obvious he wasn't working on GW 2 for a long time. I assume this holds true for Matthew as well. 
---
https://twitter.com/tivac/status/1100122072355753984
---
Not just public faces i'm afraid.
---
"We will be moving directly from Living World Season 4 into Season 5 as promised, and we plan to continue a regular cadence of updates and releases."
---
Just because they worked on GW2 in the past, doesn't mean that they were doing that now. It was already known that a lot of people had been shifted to other projects. 
---
Pretty disgusting to see that this comment got so heavily downvoted, but I guess it's because of the way you come off.
---
It was a lie, not the first from anet managment.
---
Remember, when restructuring of this scale happens, there are no safe options. Everyone is affected, both employees and customers.
---
Stop buying gems until Anet gives us roadmap for next few years and confirms at least 1 expansions. Until then expect LW5 to be the end of the game.
---
&gt; Did they actually claim that GW2 was not going to be affected? 
---
I guess it depends on what you would consider "game services". That could have just meant that the game will continue to run and nothing more. :/
---
they claim that because they had already moved those devs to the other projects
---
Cool
---
There goes the content.
---
Come hell or high water, I'm getting my money back. Can't get the time back, though. I love my characters so much, but I regret everything and I should have known this was going to happen.
---
[I had to unsub for a moment for this screenshot](blob:https://imgur.com/c94b89a4-62ca-48b2-bd54-9a90dd0cfded)
---
&gt; At this point I dread the moment when Anet will go for Norn/Jormag expansion lol 
---
I'm not entirely confident that we'll *get* another expanison, and if we do I'm certainly not confident that it won't be bland af, considering the types of devs that have already been announced as laid off.
---
so? the only thing confirmed is season 5, exactly what I said.
---
Ok, they said the "game services" would not be affected. That's different than saying that the games would not be affected at all.
---
that's a fair point, hmm it's odd that their entire jobs would be laid off because after a certain point their job became nothing but a side project that would never see the light of day.
---
His recent patreon posts says he switched from working in art department to being trained in design department some time ago so he expected this outcome. Really sad to see him go nonetheless.
---
Morons at ncsoft are probably removing the devs who have been there for long and consequently have higher salaries. These dickheads are going to damage the game and lose a lot more money than they save. A franchise like Guild Wars needs to have some veterans supporting it, knowing its history and where it's going.
---
they probably already moved them to the other projects
---
People nowadays are just too scared to try and fail. They want instant results without much effort and for certain type of content it's just not possible with such mentality.
---
The sooner people realize that it's alright to fail, it's alright to make mistakes and actually learn from them, that they cant do everything by just rolling over keyboard and not paying attention to whats going on...the sooner they'll get into whatever content is bothering them. There's plenty of resources and people who want to help, everyone has the same access to everything, dont blow your chance with open world-like mindset where everything gets done with blobs of people and waypoints.
---
I cant remember the last time I had to pay attention to any world boss mechanic. The majority of the game is too forgiving, dont let that spoil you too much when you start doing something slightly more challenging.
---
methew was not so long ago taking part in lw related stream talking about his work on it, so no, these people are not from other projects, they are directly involved in live development of gw2
---
oh man this bloody makes me sad. Woul,d it be selfish to see if he left us new SAB stuff ? btw his youtube channel is awesome
---
Extremely cynical and really lacking of constructive formatting to allow for a response. 
---
While i agree with certain aspects of what you say, i'm not going to comment on such strong statements.
---
PoF release was long ago and current events were dropped fast. Also I see no source on your statements either. I am not here to defend Anets actions in the past and now. I have a few grimes with them, however I am not gonna act like a total donkey and create a throwaway account just to spite people. I know I am just rubbing your hubris right now and this will be my last reply to you. 
---
Don't get ascended trinkets with laurels, do the LW3 maps for those. Laurels are very limited and you'll regret spending them on trinkets that you can easily get on LW3 maps with a wider selection range.
---
&gt; It was a lie, not the first from anet managment.
---
Proof?
---
&gt;Stop buying gems until Anet gives us roadmap for next few years and confirms at least 1 expansions. Until then expect LW5 to be the end of the game.
---
So...make the game less profitable and paint a larger target for corp to shut it down? Great idea!
---
absolutely not, not so long ago mathew was part of lw related stream talking about his work on one of the episodes, he was actively working on season 4, meaning recent content
---
I'm feeling one coming. We don't have one yet (except through some third parties) and people are starting to twitter about their departures...
---
I would guess we'll get some kind of communication from Anet.. 
---
Welcome to any gaming subreddit. 
---
Yea, I can be snarky and shitpost but at the end of the day they're down voting the sentiment behind it.
---
Matthew Medina is a huge surprise. I would have probably initially put him the "safe" category based on his contributions to the game, but damn man. He should easily find work elsewhere given his experience. GL.
---
&gt; their job became nothing but a side project that would never see the light of day
---
That's actually exactly what this round of layoffs was meant to eliminate.
---
We also don't know if the departures were layoffs as part of the announcement, or voluntary departures to allow for shuffling.
---
A lot of the internal details, we'll never have. Not from a reliable source.
---
Fear-mongering like this is exactly what kills a game going through such a crisis. Just stop, you're not making things better.
---
&gt; these people are not from other projects, they are directly involved in live development of gw2
---
That's a bold *assumption* to make. Where is your proof? Cause currently you're making a ass out of yourself. From what I see all of these devs being let go today haven't worked on GW2 in a very long time.
---
Anyone that actually believed that is very very very gullible
---
&gt; Proof?
---
Mathew was part of lw release guld chats actively working on season 4
---
&gt; So...make the game less profitable and paint a larger target for corp to shut it down? Great idea!
---
Are you going to fund the game without knowing what to expect? Anet approves
---
What do you mean, get your money back? 
---
This is probably exactly what's going on. Gotta funnel in new (and cheaper) labor... it's the game industry way after all.
---
You mean the episode that was released 6 months ago?
---
Honestly the clothing detail is insane and I’m even really impressed by the hair, however the face just looks off. The wrinkles/folds of his skin around the mouth are too... Sharp? Perhaps changing his expression to a relaxed one, or taking some weight out of his face would fix it. But since it’s a meaner there’s always the option of a mask.
---
when ncsoft closes multiple projects and fires people it means less money for anet
---
Josh, Matthew, Connie, and Aaron. Who is next...
---
It's the industry everywhere. It's why many old engineers stay in their companies till they're fired, because other companies don't want to pay senior experience when they can force their older employees to train the newer, cheaper engineers.
---
And just like much of industry in the US, there are no unions. Particularly in tech and game design.
---
Let people make that decision on their own. Rallying them against the company while they're already going through hard times because of an unfortunate decision from NCsoft isn't exactly an encouragement. People just lost their jobs, their fucking livelihood, their colleagues with whom they've worked for so many years. Give them a fucking break to get their heads straight, the news is literally just in. If there isn't a proper statement from ANet regarding the matter and what the future entails, thén by all means do whatever. But at least, just for today, let them get through their loss. They sure as hell lost way more than you will if this game dies after this (and that's a pretty big if, imo).
---
100% today press release.
---
There are a lot of instances, idk all companies do PR, Anet just flat-out lie and deny stuff *first* then take a step back if they can't get away with it. It is like company policy.
---
Anyway, it is what it is i suppose.
---
which one was that?
---
and Connie and Aaron
---
wtf anet this guy helped put you on the map with his sab, surely he got more tricks.
---
so sad why do we have to lose the good devs, while we stuck with some of the ... less liked ones
---
Probably at least 20 years unless a major technological breakthrough makes it impossible to play without using an old computer
---
Obviously we don't know the internals but the fact that he wasn't kept in the company and moved to a different team shows you Guild Wars 2 is done.
---
Hopefully Anet releases a statement about roadmaps sometime soon to help the fans stop freaking out
---
inb4 it will drop down sooner or later anyways... :(
---
&gt; Mathew was part of lw release guld chats actively working on season 4
---
He was talking about an episode that came out 6 months ago. That's a long time.
---
&gt;Are you going to fund the game without knowing what to expect? Anet approves
---
The game could be shutdown tomorrow. No one ever knows what to expect. That is called life.
---
From waht was posted by the original journalist releasing news about lay offs, nvsoft expected at least 1 release from anet in 2018 or 2019. They strongly stressed this is a reason for the restructuring
---
Entitled people have been around since the dawn of humanity. 
---
*MUH AGE OF ENTITLEMENT* is just crap the boomers love to say to discredit younger generation's gripes. 
---
Getting flashbacks to Monkey Island 2/3.
---
You really need to grow up. It’s a corporate work environment and apparently no gw2 devs were impacted directly. They then cancel their best opportunity to ease the WvW community and their concerns, and continue to stay mostly quiet. Gw2 devs have let down a lot of the community in recent months, and it’s not the players fault that they’re failing their own business model
---
As noone has linked it: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Ranger
---
Basically no single build will be the meta for every game mode.   
---
Power DPS works well in almost all situations, but in PVE you will run it with pure berserker gear which will get you killed faster in WVW (marauder would be better)
---
That's how development and project based industries work...not just game development. Mining, architectural, any infrastructural projects, etc...they're all the same.
---
It's an inherent risk you take on when you work on a specific project. If it is coming as a shock, it either means you are naive about the industry or simply lack the experience to know that this is how they are.
---
Is that a rip to SAB world 3 then 
---
They were using 3 teams for lw right, and leapfrogging their releases so the same team does e1 and e4, the next does e2 and e5, and the last does e3 and e6?
---
So it is possible he was on one of the teams that has finished their involvement with the season and was moved to other projects after that.
---
Engi turrets while  watching screen and actively paying attention..if u miss a gm pm u busted.
---
Enhi turret at ice floe in thunder 
---
Head. Pm me and I'll show u and explain drops
---
so why should i fund it at all?
---
Okay. Bye!
---
yay no more SAB.
---
Sorry to see the dev go though.
---
For anyone wondering the context of this chain:
---
&gt;There goes the content.
---
&gt;&gt;What do you mean, get your money back?
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;For the gems, duh. I'll have to figure out a way to charge all this shit back and move on.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Issuing a chargeback for something you willingly purchased would be credit card fraud my friend. Have fun with that.
---
P.S. You can't escape deleted comments.
---
What I wanted to say before it was deleted, if anyone regrets such experiences this badly I'd say to just never, ever, touch a MMO ever again.
---
We need a list of all layoffs as its own thread, imo.
---
&gt; Games are an interactive media. Getting from point A to B is supposed to  be the fun and, unlike other media, getting to point B is NOT assured.  That is where the satisfaction comes - from overcoming that challenge  yourself. 
---
This your opinion man, not objective fact on how games work. Thats like saying all Movies should have happy endings.
---
With all due respect to his work, that is some /r/FuckMyShitUp hair.
---
And the gemstore designers.
---
Nerf mesmers, though. Of course!

[Grant Gertz](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Grant_Gertz) as well (https://twitter.com/ggspeaksfree/status/1100136498639253504). [Connie Griffith](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Connie_Griffith) too.
---
except nobody is talking about criticising "all day long" and the criticism absolutely has merit.
---
I cant make anyone to do anything. my posts are suggestions to act logically not emotionally. Throwing money a anet is the worst thing to do as they gonna believe that without releasing content they can suck money by creating drama only.
---
Seems so

&gt; Last week, we announced the upcoming release of our new WvW mount, the Warclaw. Unfortunately, this release will be delayed until Tuesday, March 5. In light of current events at the studio, we are taking this time to focus on our friends and colleagues. We hope you understand and we apologize for this delay.

---
This is very sad. Foreman is one of my favourite dev/artists of GW2 by far :(
---
I knew you have no actual response to this. Act emotionally and ignore logic, anet wants this.
---
How come you guys don't use the novelty hotkey? Wouldn't it be faster than double clicking the item?
---
See ya, won't be missed.
---
Devs who had still been working on gw2 have lost their jobs today.
---
Josh wasn't really working for gw2 but did on and off. He chose to leave
---
so who's making season 5? forums team?
---
Well he did claim he had some plans for a little passion project in regards to Malyck, I thus pictured some sort of conclusion to the story. 
---
To be honest, I was counting on the fact that, with Matt on board, we would eventually get some closure on this, so this just hit me rather hard, not to mention the other great stuff he has done. 
---
&gt; Why should Guild Wars specifically abide their will? 
---
Maybe you should see how Anet markets the game and you'll answer your questions. 
---
GW2 was never marketed as a hardcore experience, it wanted to separate itself from the competition. No gear tiers,focus on teamwork,shared resources.  What kind of crowd do you think that's going to attract? 
---
Which is a good sign. It's much more interesting if there are different ways to beat a dungeon
---
as expected
---
I'm not leaving, I'm getting lw for free due to idiots funding this game without demanding quality in return :)
---
Fair enough. Another week of wait time isn't too bad.
---
**Alright.**
---
:(
---
Good luck everyone.
---
The ships sinking lmao. 
---
HOLY S... Should've expected, probably means the balance patch will be delayed too.
---
&gt; The problem is people reaching so far and assuming that everything in  the game should be available for them regardless of personal  performance, because "it's not fair" for content to be locked otherwise.  That's the fundamental argument. 
---
Well when you make up a large chuck of said community that's paying the bills to keep the servers on, who do you think Anet is gonna listen too? 
---
Will we still get the balance patch or is that delayed aswell?
---
Now who is being emotional?
---
Viable: Literally all of them  
---
Meta: Check Snow Crows
---
you :)
---
This is really terrible news. It's sad to see so many originals go. After GW1 ended and we moved to GW2 I lost a lot of in game friends. Connections built over years just gone. People moved on from the game. I had some solace in knowing at least the OG staff were around doing their thing. With all these departures I feel like nothing from the "good ol days" is left anymore. This alone almost drives me to not want to play anymore.
---
&gt;You always have the power not to play the content or hell, the game
---
And we all know how having less active players is healthy for the community.
---
And all i'm saying is he can wait for them to know if they still have a job before asking anything. And he goes around about ''deserving'' better than LS5, which he has no idea what will be about. That's plenty demanding to me.
---
Gw2 officially dead....
---
Your comment is a very exaggerated, but the core is true. If things keep going down this road, the game simply won’t last
---
well, of course
---
God forbid he puts his OPINION on the internet!!!
---
big respect to deroir not be affraid of saying truth! i 100% agree with everything he said. 
---
None of that proves anything? Okay then not much else to talk about with you. You are not here to learn, you are here to be an apologist. Be my guest, i got better things to do.
---
For second part, 
---
https://twitter.com/maclainediemer/status/1100130536666816514
---
And more to come as day goes on. Again, please actually do some research instead of randomly trying to be a knight, it is rather silly.
---
Should I feel bad that this didn't even make me facepalm?
---
I'm not calling people morons and not letting a conversation that is going nowhere die. You are. So...
---
I can see that, but these people had some great knowledge and potential in regards to GW2's future (narrative decisions, jumping puzzles) and honestly, if an expansion pack has not been in the works, then without these people on it, and without the polish of three years, I am a lot less looking forward to one. 
---
I am losing many hopes about the game this month.
---
No its that AAA gaming is a shit show and you cant pander to everyone. The end. 
---
Best map in the expansion by far
---
Barefoot Matthew is not involved with gw2? Being a corporate world doesn't prevent basic human decency, you can give them few days for things to settle before a more extended communication, it's a video game we're talking about not water/electricity supply... 
---
\&gt;  Stop buying gems until Anet gives us roadmap for next few years and confirms at least 1 expansions. Until then expect LW5 to be the end of the game. 
---
Sounds more like a demand than a suggestion to me, too much of a ring of finality in the last sentence. Still fearmongering.
---
Idk most of the answers seem to agree with the podcast, your just downvoted cause you brought in generations 
---
Yeah, I predicted that. It's unfortunate, but understandable.
---
Thank god something other than a circlejerk
---
source on Connie? I dont know her twitter acct.
---
Siren's Reef is the best JP in the game :(
---
Sure - money that was going to those projects in particular is going to be lost. But, tt also means less of their income is going towards funding those projects, and much of it will be redirected back to Guild Wars 2.
---
I got downvoted to hell already in another thread , it's tomorrow , we'll just wait and see.
---
That has nothing to do with what I said in my response.
---
Jesus hundreds of people just lost their jobs, and everyone in here is crying because they won't get their fucking mount? At least fucking try to be sympathetic.
---
I was having some random musings yesterday and had the showerthought: "No one says 'everything is going to be okay' when everything is okay." Hahaha. In any case, you should definitely be concerned and looking ahead I hope we get some good news but doesn't sound too promising.
---
Honestly... this isn't good. Right now it's a crucial time for the game and stuff like this (No stream, delayed release) while understandable are quite the blows. They are losing the confidence of the players, they are showing they cannot handle stuff like this.
---
Anet needs to understand that they are a company first.
---
Indeed. It's also baffling to me how short of a notice they get. In my country there's a buffer period that usually lasts at least 3 months (although 6 is not uncommon either) from you fire someone until they actually leave. 
---
I am sad
---
I got downvoted to hell already in another post , it's tomorrow , we'll just wait and see.
---
Josh was one of my favorite devs. I hope he ends up with a good studio that can make more productive use of his talents.
---
I feel like this puts a pretty big nail in the coffin of the idea that "all the people fired were working on non-essential side projects and GW2 will be fine". 
---
&gt; You need proof of Anet lying before, seriously?
---
Doesn't that seem a little condescending to you?
---
Basically, they're *transformations* or *bundles*, not stuns/CC. In order to make your skill bar change, the character is transformed into the trapped state. This is also why Kodan torches are dropped if you happen to be carrying one. 
---
Judging from some employees' tweets, they were given a choice whether to voluntarily leave or not before forced redundancies were announced. That means no one really knew how this process would affect things like game updates. That means there will be short term disruption while the company restructures. Suck it up, people's livelihoods are more important than you playing a videogame.
---
I've been away from Guild Wars 2 since December of 2016 and am starting to get the itch to possibly come back. I was curious if someone could give me a summary of what has changed - for better and worse.
---
Overall, is the game in a better state than it was two years ago or has it gone downhill? Is it still a ridiculous click-fest with various items? Have Fractals gotten any form of revamp?
---
Mount wont be coming out tomorrow. So you still have time to get used to WvW.
---
&gt; Obviously we don't know the internals but the fact that he wasn't kept in the company and moved to a different team shows you Guild Wars 2 is done.
---
&gt; Hopefully Anet releases a statement about roadmaps sometime soon to help the fans stop freaking out
---
If you've already decided that GW2 is done, it's unlikely any statement from Anet will change your mind.
---
So it wasn't finished? 
---
Maybe they don't want to face the post-patch bug fix rush. 
---
Absolutely not. NCsoft gets the money and gives anet what they need to fund projects and in general keep the company alive. This means, less money for anet in general as now ncsoft is goign to move profit to projects they expect to success, unlike anet.
---
citation needed
---
Might as well package it with the next LS story at this point.
---
I'm waiting. It's going to be a fun ride watching anet trying to survive.
---
I read on twitter ~100 people got let go. Can’t remember which dev tweeted it though. 
---
I doubt Arenanet has the tools to measure such trends, they are complicated to develop (much harder than, say, build templates). They probably go by perceived feedback in communities.
---
I’m 27, so clearly it’s not just a “boomer” thing.
---
To hell with NCSoft. 
---
danm you Ncsoft
---
Completely agree. There's no point in reading too much on speculation. It is always easy to imagine the worst.

No, not really. I believe now believe what he said but that doesn't change the fact that he was acting like a jerk about it.
---
then matthew leaving was either his choice or anet is lying about the gw2 team/experience not being affected
---
That's a weird statement. Were they commenting on the fact that known developers are gone now or is this actual info from a source about the future?
---
If you have Domain of Istan from season 4, it's super easy to farm for like 10g+ in an hour doing Great Hall/Palawadan runs.  There's usually a squad running it continuously.  The chests are capped, but you can still get the other rewards.
---
yeah and guess what all of the so talented 
---
 and valuable people on the managment, which did so much good for gw2 in the last few years, are keept...
---
I thought they said only side projects were involved in the layoffs? From the tweets, it looks like people actually working on GW2 were also hit.
---
once a liar always a liar, that's anet :)
---
Josh streams on twitch for any who want to continue to follow him.
---
We'd love to have you.

you have finite charges to doge you goober
---
Just a tip, ALL CAPS THREAD TITLES scream attention whoring / clickbaits, at least for me. Maybe don't do that next time you post something.
---
Will anet refund my vacation day I took for this? 
---
I don't know how to feel about this. I understand they have to sort things out but I also understand now is the precise moment they should be as solid as they can when it comes to content releases.
---
In your previous comment you seemingly implied that NC pulled the plug on Utopia and told Anet to work on GW2, that's all.
---
Ah! I was noticing that just this morning. Completely forgot again &gt;,&lt;
---
I agree. What did you expected? That i'd argue that farming 250 gold isn't a grind and grinding materials for ascended isn't a grind (though there's plenty of ways of getting full set of ascended and 250 gold without grinding)? Suddenly every fucking person in this thread missed that my initial point was not about the grind, but the fact that the game does not give you everything by your wish.

---
Not how it works. Not how anything works. A guy claiming to have a 140 IQ should know that.
---
&gt; As a customer I am really questioning how much time/money I should be investing into this game
---
Easy answer, none until they show some actual content to back up this "gw2 isn't affected at all" PR bullshit and regain the players trust.
---
They got greedy and moved too much resources away from the game. GW2 has been declining for a long time now. I'll wait to see some awaited features, raids, alliances, build templates, literally any sign of life that could get my friends and I interested again before I dip back into this game.
---
&gt; I believe it all comes down to personal opinion of what makes a game enjoyable 
---
Im aware of that and at the end of the day, I just think Anet has made a poor balancing act between who they cater too with their game design. 
---
I dont mean to deride people who want their games to be challenging, I simply get frustrated when accessibility and deriding those who want a casual experience is acceptable behavior.
---
 The guy in the stream goes on a long winded rant about the dangers of participation trophies and so on when talking **in the context of a god damn videogame** which is just so out of touch it boggles my mind. 
---
If you listened to people fear mongering about entitlement it just poisons your mind and promotes the toxic bullshit we see in gaming. Its a smokescreen for extremely selfish behavior.
---
"MY REWARD. MY ACHIEVEMENT. MY SHINY. MY TITLE." 
---
It just reeks of  inflated self-importance 
---
/gg
---
 That episode came out quite a while ago and seeing as he's a writer he would have been part of the beginning of the creation of the episode which can be several months before release. So your assumption is not really valid. 
---
Vacation day on patch days? You sure do live dangerously...or new to MMOs.
---
I think that people are a LOT more concerned about bonus wxp week and balance patch because there's no information about that. I honestly couldnt care less about mount and I completely understand the delay.
---
I think he meant citation needed for the hundreds part. We know NcSoft planned to fire 400 people but only a few were from Anet. Basically, not hundreds.
---
God dammit of course the game crashes and burns right when I decide to pick it back up. At least I didn't dump TOO much money into it this time around. Can't rightly say I care too much about the future of the game since they are letting go everyone who adds anything to the game. Not too interested in playing some anet interns newest expansion to GW2.
---
 /u 
---
 /r is for subreddits.
---
Baby don't hurt me
---
  
---
You'll see in a month probably. It's an event for April's Fools.
---
And you all kept saying it was a false alarm and that people should chill. Think again now. Most of the core team is leaving, I don't know how you can be calm and have hope for a bright future for guild wars.
---
I would imagine they are getting severance packages where they still get a few more paychecks.
---
I bet if he went and released a SAB-esue indie game it would end up outselling gw2.
---
One of the many mistakes anew management did IMO was forcing him to stop interacting with the community just because he liked to discuss behind the scenes development stories, They needed more not less of that. Instead they opted for a back-patting live stream.
---
I already got downvoted to hell for listing them , it's tomorrow , we'll wait and see. But it's been mentioned by several people in several threads
---
The first group to fall to the sickle of NCSoft's bureaucratic wrath.
---
Well, and please correct me if Im wrong, but thats working in america for you. 
---
They would typically get a severance package, so they're paid for extra months but don't have to come into work.
---
yup and two is enough to get through most spikes. throw in an energy sigil and you're good to go.
---
GW2 *services* won't be affected, services just meaning things like the servers running and gemstore being open. They have chosen their words very carefully, they could have said Guild Wars 2 won't be affected, but they didn't.
---
No, the layoffs were for ArenaNet, but it isn't certain that they are for Guild Wars 2 developers. Nobody was going to know until today anyways, so it was dumb to speculate before now.
---
&gt; During these meetings, sources said that ArenaNet's Mike O'Brien was grief-stricken. "He kept wandering around just saying we'll get through this" repeatedly.
---
Thanks for the help
---
It does not. I am actually pretty surprised anyone that uses reddit and plays gw2 would need proof unless you are like super new, in which case i'll apologize. Are you? 
---
As is tradition.
---
I doubt any developer won't find a job. On the other hand stuff like this affects the game a lot and the trust of the people, so no, in this case, it's when they should focus on the game.
---
This can't be stressed enough. Everyone shouting high and low of how they're afraid that their game is going to die without even considering the fact that today many people lost something that was much, much more than that to them.
---
I can see him keeping away from gaming roles now and investing more in his other artistic talents.
---
Waiting for a random billionaire player to buyout ArenaNet, re-hire former employees and announce Guild Wars 3 starting production. 
---
I hope Mike O’Brien will stay strong if someone can get us thru this NCSoft backstab it's him.
---
Welcome to America, the home of "At-Will Work" states.  Where you are expected to give your employer 2 weeks notice before you leave but they are not expected to extend the courtesy back.
---
I hope all those affected find new work/income quickly and safely. 
---
I have no personal ties to Mike, but that got me too. A man so broken he can do nothing but pace. It really makes you wish this could have gone a different way.

Hi! I'm a ranger main and I got both geared. Personally, I really like both builds, but I think with power you'll have an easier time to get into group content like fractals. Additionally, Soulbeast is a lot of fun to play in WvW - as a roaming class. For zergfights, it's too squishy and/or doesn't provide enough for the party or squad. However, as I mentioned, there's various power soulbeast builds out there for roaming, with power Slb having sick mobility and getting across maps or to/out of fights in the blink of an eye. You can play the ever-memed and hated Longbow Slb, a sick oneshot build with axe(s), can stealth yourself, roam on druid, have sick crits with your shiny greatsword and and and. Like most classes, it has its weaknesses and counterplays, but generally power is a lot of fun to play in wvw (and once you get used to it, you can even play Berserker - but probably not too easy to start with, I'll give you that). Also, be aware that ranger hate in wvw is real. Don't let that discourage you, tho. For now, if you have to choose, I'd recommend power - but be aware that a balance patch is soon (™) upon us, so my personal recommendation might soon be outdated.
---
In fact, If memory serves me right, mesmer greatsword attack chain deals more damage the further away you are 
---
What part is exaggerated?
---
No. I just don't take anything at face value. Ever. I need proof before I will believe anything.
---
Josh, I fucking hated your JPs and they brought me to my knees. They also taught me a very valuable lesson. 
---
&gt; It doesn't matter how hard, how much or how long you fail today. Sleep, rest and nail it tomorrow morning.
---
 It saddens me deeply that I will no longer be internally screaming while doing JPs. 
---
You will be missed. :( Take care xoxox
---
The people who made Kourna :barf:
---
Well firing key developers who have institutional knowledge and delaying a scheduled release because of firings doesn't help...
---
as a part of live team development he should have already been engaged into season 5, unless their claims of keeping content cadence wasn't another lie :)
---
This alone proves that NCSoft blind-side fucked them.
---
Not to mention it's pretty common in this industry to work this way. That is, pay them for 3-6 months more but terminate them immediately. The last thing you want is someone on your team who knows they're on their way out, dragging down morale. 
---
I wish some kindhearted billionaire would come along and purchase Anet away from their situation with NCsoft and give them full freedom to work on what they love, but ofc that wont ever happen :(
---
A week is 7 days 
---
Notch isn't doing anything right now...
---
True. But Anet also said they plan on delivering new content so we'll see. I just hope to god Anet releases a statement about future plans so we know
---
i think they said something like people will still have a few months, probably in payment (my guess.) I'll try to find that.
---
This is clearly the incompetence as usual of the GW2 devs. Announce an announcement, delayed! Announce a live stream, delayed AFTER the stream ends! Announce a content drop, you guessed it, delayed! 
---
GW2 isn't effected, this is the same continuing incompetence we all should have come to expect. 
---
in 2013 they gave an interview saying they have 4 mobile teams, so indeed they announced this but people forgot (or didnt care as it was around chinese release)
---
so did you, hypocrite :)
---
Any low paid replacement designer can throw together an outfit that glows.
---
This. Those titles instantly make me not wanna click it. Was hoping to see someone who had the same kind of thought process and found myself lucky.
---
Mate that's your risk that you took.
---
I don’t have this sourced or anything, but the vibe I’ve been getting from some of these posts is that perhaps the layoffs were not finalized and that people could choose to take the hefty severance as a buyout. That’s common enough but again, that’s conjecture. 
---
This game is dead on maintenance mode but keep buying those gems boys!
---
Yeah I read somewhere they were going to fire 400 people but I think I misread it....it's Anet that has 400 people working there not that that number is getting fired. Still they mentioned this is part of a larger restructuring from NcSoft.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iV5MB3q_UOU
---
It was in this series- I think it was in this episode
---
This makes me really really really sad and is a great loss for Arena Net to not have Josh Foreman and now i also see Matthew Medina. They will leave big gaps to fill up. *sad*
---
Wow and the audio team. If there was something that GW2 always was great at then it was the music and the audio. *more sad*
---
This will really hit hard and i can't help but feel worried.
---
I pasted the link to someone else, so you should be able to also see it
---
Games been dead for years
---
You took a day of vacation to be number 278 in queue?
---
back then there was also talk about a companion app for gw2 though
---
I don't know why I can't help my tears keep dropping knowing that Josh left ArenaNet.
---
4 mobile teams for companion app? sure :)
---
I'm shocked, this is a huge loss to GW2. So much for the layoffs not affecting GW2.
---
For the US it's not uncommon to get a monetary compensation for around the same time period though, afaik (I'm german)
---
Look through comments in the topic about Josh Forman leaving. There's tons of links to tweets of other employees leaving too.
---
so the intern Bob and his disabled sister
---
Wait what Connie Griffith too? But she made PoF great (well together with others too ofc) but i thought she would be safe. Ok now i am really really worried.
---
The curse of layoffs is that the people who get to stay end up wishing they were axed instead of working the jobs of 2 or more.
---
Oh yeah, dead game just released a new map 2 months ago. Man I wish all dead games were like this...
---
Yeah I agree. Core maps are less interesting in the 'traversing' of them- but they looked much cleaner, more enjoyable to look at. 
---
Pretty sure they weren’t expecting the layoffs when they made those announcements....
---
Thanks for this post, I'll definitely use it as a guideline while going through the game.
---
&gt; People these days confuse want for need.  If that’s not entitlement, I don’t know what is. 
---
Yea you can go in a time machine and this sentiment will still appear relevant in any time period. 
---
&gt;   But to turn away and say it’s not worst now is just naive.  
---
See above.
---
&gt;  The way we communicate and exchange information has changed so much in such a short time. 
---
I'd love to go on a deeper rant about the socio and economical benefits and ramifications of how we exchange information nowadays but I assure you it hasnt made people more entitled. More impatient maybe but there is no correlation as you can't measure 'entitlement'.  Thats a subjective sentiment from person to person. Ill leave it at that. 
---
Yikes... I never read into that part of Foreman. 
---
What about the balance patch?
---
"A" delayed release? This is the third delay involving specifically this content on schedules that they have set. They are clearly fucking incompetent.
---
..At this point can you really be surprised by ArenaNet's management skills? Come on, bro. :\
---
And like that, ANet has made me lose all faith in the game's future.
---
This has made me go from "uneasy" to "frightened", bordering on "abandon fucking ship"
---
, You’ve got a point, and yeah, barefoot was involved. However, I just don’t trust Anet at this point to communicate, even when they need to the most. I truly don’t think, even a week from now, that they will realise a lot of the playerbase is uncertain. I’d love to be proven wrong, and have the make a big statement next week, but with their track record, i suppose I just expect it
---
Does this mean there never will be SAB world 3? 
---
Maybe they‘ll tell us now... ;)
---
Other articles are mentioning ArenaNet being force to merge with NCSoft West. That is actually really worrying for the future of the game.
---
Yea that is good but, don't you think you should put in *some* effort instead of just demanding proof, especially on widely known things or things that are literally 1 google search away?
---
This sucks...
---
Did you pay for this free update? No? Then sit tight and wait.
---
How will GW2 not be affected with fewer developers working on it? Is that not a contradictory statement in itself?
---
Unless they mean current state of GW2 is unaffected like servers or play-ability. Still means that future content is affected.
---
I thought the idea was we have a dev team working on xpac between living story to alternate between the two. What happened to that?
---
I wasn’t replying to your original comment, just replying to your ridiculous statement saying by these people’s logic every game is grind...
---
Anet offices are closed today and tomorrow.  They're not going to patch when there's nobody around to apply hot fixes.
---
Considering Anet doesn't pay its IT staff I bet everything is made by interns lmao.
---
And when did all the recent drama happen...? Oh right, within the last 7 days. Totally comparable to what you're saying.
---
At least one good news today. The one of the very few deserved lay offs.
---
I think so too, but it still seems so freaking abrupt though. Like "Oh yea sorry, you're not coming back to work tomorrow!". I feel like it must leave a much worse feeling then "Sorry, but in three months you gotta leave.", even if you get payed the same amount. Although I guess one pro of it is that you get time to apply for new jobs in time you'd normally work, but still. 
---
The lay offs weren't supposed to effect GW2 devs and was made AFTER they had already fucked up on two of the three delays for this specific content, any excuse for those two? 
---
Well, unfortunately this is how businesses work nowadays. Everyone expects infinite growth instead of just being happy to get good results/revenue year after year. The easiest way to cut costs is to reduce your payroll. 
---
We haven't been seeing jumping puzzles since pretty much PoF's release (there was only 1 puzzle in PoF, inside a story instance). I wouldn't be surprised if he was the main guy behind most of them.
---
He was one of the pillars of the game. I trust he's going to keep doing his thing from now on. Don't let us down Mr. Foreman! We all know SAB was but a glimpse of something better. I'll be waiting.
---
Take your meds and stop creating reddit accounts just to trashtalk and troll.
---
Keep dreaming.
---
&gt; Where'd you go Chronomancer?
---
still there http://b.thumbs.redditmedia.com/JLgxAoySkxW4idQwDYM4sUYHhiPVhfQf0XyXiR7iW3c.png
---
Yep. You are actually unwelcome in my squads if youre gonna run base thief. Go to metabattle and copy paste a build then come back and you'll be 100% more prepared to actually play the game. 
---
PvErs in PvE gear in WvW are just free bags. We are HELPING YOU by telling you to not play wvw in pve gear. 
---
Don’t think the game is “falling apart” and don’t think it’s “super watered down”. I think there’s a degree of truth to those, but gw2 is still an immensely popular MMO with excellent content for new players.
---
No, people being laid off or not being laid off has nothing to do with my response. You can't seriously be this incompetent...right?
---
Yeah. I wish I could have a dead game that made 70 million a year. 
---
For real? 
---
Sorry, I do not know your ways, but it's interestic what the implications above say about you :)
---
That must feel so bad when you've worked so hard for core Gw2, got selected for your talent to create new games, to in the end lose your job because the new projects weren't released ... Damn that's sad, I hope everyone will find another job quickly
---
Whats the point of giving someone that option?( Maybe I misunderstood)
---
“But isnt it like: do you want to leave yourself or should we fire you instead tomorrow?” Or what?
---
SAB is one of my favorite events... sad to see we'll never see W3 W4 etc...
---
You have gained a level in interpreting corporate word-smithing.
---
Can you drop links to the tweets so people can send them some appreciation?
---
&lt;3 you Vision  6,826 hours across all characters. \[CaLM\] for life
---
Not Gaile Gray, she's a treasure... they can take Chris Cleary though. But yeah not Josh :( too late now though I guess
---
Damn. Today really is a sad day.
---
Keep buying those gems you can fill the holes in this ship with your cash for your two hours of story three times a year.
---
That statement is just dumb. It's not going to be affected but fewer people will work on it? Of course it will be affected then??? 
---
Yup, she also confirmed it on her Facebook. :(
---
Stop feeding the troll, for God's sake.
---
Ah I'm so sorry. I copy pasted the article title which was in caps to keep it accurate and didn't really focus on It. Something I would normally not do. 
---
soooo no balance patch?
---
It's shitty how NCSoft is purging all the really good talent, but a *lot* of blame lies at the management at Anet for letting this even happen in the first place. Whoever greenlit keeping a fucking skeleton crew on GW2 with the goal of stringing fans along is the person that should be let go, not people like Josh Foreman.
---
While I don't disagree with the spirit of your statement, the fact is that their livelihoods **are** from us playing their video games.  I hope all those affected find new income streams / work soon.
---
Also, I doubt that they allowed people to "voluntarily" leave.  If NCSoft is to be believed, this is a restructuring based on non-profitable ventures.  This isn't a scale equation where you just need to get rid of X number of employees; there are staff positions that must be filled in order to keep things running.
---
If there is one dev that can make me uncertain for the future of guildwars its Josh Foreman. His work was a big part of what I love in the game and its really bleak to see him go...
---
In what? She was arrogant and useless. She was the worst community manager I've seen in any mmo. The only reason she was liked was because people found it cool to talk to a "dev" in gw1 LA long time ago.
---
Well you're saying that the game is in maintenance mode after something that happened in less than 7 days ago....Do you see the irony?
---
Even "new content" is chosen wisely. They could add a new skin and call it "content". The reality is we know absolutely nothing.
---
Not familiar with her past work, but seems like she’s been a gw2 dev for an incredibly long time. What makes you think this one was deserved?
---
Yeah you just came in at a bad time, lots of recently negative but misdirected attention. The game is fine, [this infographic](https://imgur.com/Lsg4iXf) is from a recent quartlery earnings report. It's still very much alive and profitable, you'll find groups for any endgame activity you want.
---
Yes and while i don't want to celebrate someone losing their job, she should've had the dignity to resign a while back herself - she didn't so idk i think i'll.
---
there is no gw2 without foreman and gaile
---
This comment section is going to be such a shitshow.
---
Well what are you still doing here? Go play some other games then buddy.
---
&gt;  If you honestly expect hardcore rewards to be given for casual content 
---
*\*They say as they accuse me of strawmanning\**
---
Is there even going to be a patch since the offices are closed for the next 2 days due to people getting fired
---
Having idiots willing to throw money at something doesn't make it alive.
---
So begins the fall. Temper and harden your hearts fellow Tyrians. We are bearing witness first hand the fallout of greed taking precedence over passion for a craft. The best we can hope for is maybe finishing out the next living story but then all bets are off.
---
&gt;Gotta focus on what's important right now
---
doing their jobs?
---
metabattle LITERALLY caters to casuals to get started in WvW. 
---
Oh come on NO
---
Where did the "hundreds of people" statistic come from?  I haven't read anything about numbers yet.  Another poster said about 100 people were let go.
---
Way to be an asshole during this, buddy. It looks like plenty of talented veterans are sticking around to. 
---
Of course, only time will tell, but have a little faith.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFN3CtcYs0Q
---
She wasn't a dev. She was a secretary, because calling her "community manager" would be disrespectful to people actually doing this job.
---
if she was anymore condescending she could ask mo for a recommendation to be trump's press secretary
---

---
god bless
---
I butted heads with her a few times even back in GW1 but she was always a nice constant... sad day all around.
---
&gt; there is no gw2
---
SOON TM
---
They mean it's the final death of hope for World 3, The gravestone going up. I was going to say "final nail in the coffin" but I think we were kinda past that
---
yeah it was 100% ncsoft's fault that anet reallocated devs to another projects while leaving gw2 with a skeleton crew working mostly in gemstore bullshit and a half assed map and story, anet did nothing wrong, also "*services will not be affected*" my ass
---
As long as not the main designers shown on wiki
---
Why is that? Do people not like Gaile? :O 
---
2 hours.
---
Princess Miya and Moto now orphanage :( 
---
Super Adventure Box World 3&amp;4 never come :(
---
No opinions but mine! Yep! Totally what I mean! 
---
Just another sign of how unexpected these layoffs were for ArenaNet. It sounds like there's a lot of scrambling going on trying to get through it all. I'm not surprised by this announcement honestly.
---
Do you have any links to where it's said they had a choice?
---
Check his post history. Dude's psychotic and created this account for no other reason than to shit on Ane, celebrate other people's loss of livelyhood and troll the shit out of this sub. Just report him.
---
Worst news yet. This feels like a massacre 
---
Everyone else had to make builds for WvW. So do you. 
---
Everyone else has to make builds to raid in PvE and do fractals, so do you. 
---
WvW is not an exception. 
---
/disappoint
---
Lots of assholes loling and eye rolling in these comments, but very little input on recommended armor prefixes and combinations.  If 10% of the comments here consisted of such feedback, then things may be a little more inviting for new players, many of whom may very well end up in your zerg.   
---
 
---
And don't be so naive as to tell people to just *"go look up a build"* and expect that they'll find what *you* want them to run.  Metabattle and similar sites very rarely offer up builds that *aren't* Zerker or Maurader, and Snowcrows is pretty much all raid.  Why don't you all share a bit of your gear knowledge if you know so much?
---
&gt;Are you implying that a chain of "quests" with a meaningful lore bits, characters and challenges, which you can not and will not complete solo, since you need a fuckton of people to complete some legendary bounties, is just a grind? What kind of twisted mindset do you have, my boy?
---
Since i described every quest line in every game and he said "how is any of that not a grind", i still do think he was implying that every game ever created is grind.
---
George Foreman leaves Anet :'( very sad. I'll never get my waffle iron.
---
Having idiots saying a game is dead doesn't make it dead either.
---
This one sucks so much, feelsbadman
---
We can wait and judge on their incompetence, whether or not this is an instance of that or some catastrophic external event is something to find out later. In any case it's unprofessional from NCSoft or Anet's part to cause this much unneeded drama, especially during a crucial time like this when player confidence is needed. 
---
So we don't know whose fault this is, probably NCSoft at this point, but the events in question are still farcical and might impact negatively on the game as a whole going forward. 
---
Didn't even have to use my AK
---
Damn that mike o brine part really hit me
---
I've been playing everyday since headstart and am now around a total of 10,539 hours across all characters (during which time I died a total of 14,244 times. That's 1.35 deaths per hour). 
---
I always admired the little details in the game, be it voice acting of npcs or the amazing environments. Everything just feels so alive and natural. 
---
I really wish for Arenanet to get out of this much stronger and for all the people that had to go: I wish you all the best, you're all talented, even if you were not in the eye of the public. 
---
I mean you could always just port into pvp lobby, guild hall, obsidian sanctum...
---
But the point is that shared inventory is instant and on demand. No swapping or loading screens to access an item.
---
&gt;the vast majority of them are bad
---
Citation required. People in top WvW guilds are probably better than you. 
---
I was expecting this after the live stream got cancelled. Let's hope the game survives all this negativity. Although I think it will many people might be put off by this.
---
Gaile now too, judging by her forum post.
---
https://twitter.com/EvangeIos as well.
---
Possibly https://twitter.com/Hernandez_Nickk ?
---
I think she was one of the people reviews on glassdoor said "to be under protection of higher ups"
---
she was useless, burnt out and actually harmend anet2customer communication significantly, I'm not gonna miss her
---
And taking into consideration years she worked for anet, she's financially secured until she gets new job so... nothing to be sentimental about.
---
Gaile is leaving too https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/839883/#Comment_839883
---
If you leave volunteerly they don't have to pay your workers compensation. The upside to the employee is they can say they weren't fired when applying for their next job if asked about it. Personally I'd always choose to be let go for the money and just explain the situation. 
---
5,371 hours in Guild Wars and 2,117 hours in Guild Wars 2. All in a world I love and with people I care for. Time well spent.
---
I wish that were the case, but it seems dev jobs everywhere are tanking. Its looking like the gaming industry is shifting to a live services model which means a smaller staff size creating a smaller game, that they expand upon over years.
---
Good. Hope miserable old witch gets a concussion from the door hitting her face first first into the ground as it smacks her useless ass on the way out. 
---
I'll never forget her times showing up as a frog in GW1, with impromptu gatherings of all sorts of players as they realized a strange activity was happening. I spent years working with her behind the scenes on GW2, relaying information about what PvE/Dungeon/Fractal/Raid players were saying about the game to her. She was a gem to work with, as were all of the devs that would go on to reach out to me in-game to have a 1-on-1 chat about the game and what they could do better.
---
I've known Gaile for so long that I cannot imagine an ANet without her, and can only imagine what she's feeling today as she struggles with the realization that when ANet reopens it will be without her. Regardless of what some folks may think of her, today is a very sad day for all GW2 fans, and I wish her the absolute best anyone possibly could.
---
If this situation teaches me one thing it's that I care too much about some 'random' company... :/ 
---
Ah well... :(
---
I hope he finds a new job soon. I enjoyed SAB a lot in GW2.
---
Alright. There's usually a reason behind things, and I don't normally judge people lightly based on initial accusations.  
---
But this? This is unacceptable. NCsoft/ArenaNet are firing all of our beloved veterans, worst of all Gaile Gray. Fuck you NCSoft, go money whore with your other IPs.
---
I’m still playing gw2 for a reason. 
---
I wasn’t talking about gw2, I was talking about the genre in general and find those statements very true still.
---
I don't remember where the hundreds came from, it just got implanted in my brain as it was thrown around a lot. Rereading an article says the number wouldn't be made public, but it would be a significant amount.
---
I guess no more instanced content for gw2.
---
It's going to be interesting witnessing game bleeding out to death in next months.
---
Different traits, different actual gear. PvE is full zerker + full dmg modifiers. WvW is a mix of different sets/runes/sigils. 
---
&gt;Guild Wars 2 will not be affected but with fewer developers working on it.
---
If both parts of the above statement are true, they are basically saying that "In order to cut costs, we've fired people and given those who are still employed a higher workload for no additional compensation."
---
Historically, this has always worked well.  Right?  Guys?  \*Right?\*
---
Interesting 
---
Sad to  see him go but good for him to volunteer, he's got plenty of future options I think
---
Dont worry .Post doesnt have "Fluff" flair .Gaile will never see it . 
---
I thought the skill-lag was at its peak already..
---
*movie voice
---
I was wrong.
---
Every good review about this game mentions the jumping puzzles and map design, and they just let go of one of the driving forces of making those points really stand out...SMH, Anet Management making poor decisions as always
---
15,967 hours. Thanks ANet, your game helped me. 
---
Our journey could have been better than it was. Well, thats life.
---
I don't understand why they can't just reorganize their staff and keep valuable people from other teams.
---
You shifted most of the talent away from GW2, now you should be able to take it back, not just fire them because they were working at the wrong project.
---
Except I paid for the game - I frequently use the gem store well over 3k to date.... a disruption in the release date is annoying.  Their internal drama is none of my concern as a paying customer, just get the shit out when they say its going to be out.  If they can't they deserve to be let go.
---
Stop the fanboy white knighting shit.  They are real people yes but they are also doing a job.  We are consumers we have a right to be upset if they push something back to "focus on their friendships".  That's a bullshit reason.
---
The way it was worded should have been more than enough indication. It was about the SERVICE not being disrupted, and that already planned releases weren't going to be cancelled. This wasn't a blizzard situation where only the esports team would get canned, the wording should have been a huge red flag when they could have easily said that nobody who has worked on guild wars would be going or that the guild wars team would still remain.

Yea okay I'll forward this to my uncle who ~~works~~ worked at Arenanet

Oh. I see. How informative. Thanks for nothing, I guess.

---
To be fair you still get paid for a while giving you time to look for a new job.
---
That being said, it still sucks, and hopefully everyone gets back on their feet as quickly as possible.
---
In the mind of a big publisher if you aren't making infinite money and having infinite growth you are considered "unsustainable". Publishers really are a disease on the industry.

holy shit.  
---
for everyone out of the loop, he is the mastermind behind the CM Fractals.

this one hits hard, i don't think he can easily be replaced.
---
Are the forums free now? Who's gonna instaban people now
---
There is no such thing as free content, silly.
---
you'll grow up one day its ok
---
we are in the minority it seems
---
But being laid off is not the same as getting fired, and every single business out there knows the difference, specially in gaming where layoffs are so common. 
---
The point being they were not suppose to tell it to their employe at this very point. They found out through a leak that a reporter wrote about and then it blew up in their faces and ofc they had to stop everything and take care of that. I mean they are a company after all and real people who work there with real lifes.
---
Is it okay to panic yet? :(
---
 Ever since HoT the content hasn't been very interesting. Sad to see people go but I've gotten tiered of seeing the same people hype up shit content for years now.  To me the living story has been a disaster and has left most of the new levels empty . Aside from the odd person here and there the new levels are like a ghost town. After 6yrs and 9k hours I'm not the only one who's unhappy with how the game has turned out. 
---
For level 68 and up yes. Anything below that you should not use master kits. 
---
We're fucked.
---
&gt; it's unlikely any statement from Anet will change your mind.
---
It's unlikely any statement from anet will hold much weight right now.
---
Just so you guys know:  https://www.thebalancecareers.com/warn-act-layoff-requirements-1918297
---
If a large number of people are being let go, they either have to give 60 days notice or pay them for 60 days.  This happened to me back in 2001 working at a Gateway 2000 call center.  It was my day off anyway and I heard it on the radio.  Tuned into the news to scenes of people I knew carrying their shit out in boxes.  Fortunately I was able to find a new employer within that 60 days (and I still work for the same company now).  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010828/aponline202920_000.htm?noredirect=on
---
Most companies just lay off and pay.  When you think about it, the potential damage all those angry people can do in 60 days far outweighs the bad press that will be forgotten in a couple weeks.  When I went to pick up my shit, every person had to be escorted by a security guard the whole time they were inside the building.  Two days prior we were working and living like family.
---
For me, it’s the ‘verticality’ thing. Same reason I avoid HoT content. Minimap is useless. I follow commander, look away for 5 seconds (e.g. to salvage something), suddenly I’m lost. The zerg is right next to me on the minimap, but I don’t see them. There’s a mountain in the way or a huge valley between us. How did they get there, where’s the hidden passage, etc. Repeat that literally every 30 seconds. After a couple of mins, I go back to one of the other maps, like everyone else.
---
On reset night, every reset night, it’s the only WvW map without a queue.
---
That this list continues to grow is breaking my heart. And this is only the publicly known ones. It includes a precious WvW dev.
---
These folks deserve every bit of respect we can give them, and it's so nice to see other studios reaching out to them.
---
TBH, she was really nice most times, and seems like a good person, but she would fit better as PART of the community, rather than as Community Manager, I doubt this will change the nazi mod situation on their official forums, but who knows.
---
yeah sure might as well, better than trolling twitter to see how bad this was
---
https://imgur.com/a/h6CoL7V
---
Also, [Lena Raine](https://twitter.com/kuraine/status/1100142596624502785) is out too. A bit different since she rejoined ArenaNet as a contractor for the LS4 sound team, but a big loss for the players nonetheless.
---
For the new players who might not know her, she was (AFAIK, don't blame me its from memory) a designer on GW2 vanilla, designer/composer on HoT ([Auric Wilds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x41Pes8Z2so) among others...), then went freelance and is now famous for the [Celeste OST](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDVM9KED46Q). Its a hard hit for the Anet sound team...
---
Fewer than it already has? God damn it, sounds like the whole of ArenaNet is just being put on maintenance mode.
---
If the side projects were the problem, you cancel them, then fire people who are no longer vital, keeping the best talent inside. Instead, they're firing everyone attached to those projects, ignoring their previous work and experience with GW2.
---
Some of the guys getting fired have probably more experience than most of the current crew working at GW2. This whole ordeal makes no fucking sense.
---
The future is looking pretty grim.
---
Eww.  No thanks to GW3
---
My assumption is it’s near maintenance mode. They’ll push out season 5, and no expansion, but I have hope
---
The only dev they had worth his salary is gone too? Damn. 
---
Classic.
---
Okay now I'm sad. He was behind my favourite content in this game, I'm certain he will find good new options.
---
Grow up
---
I'm more worried about the game future's than the warclaw update. So many core important people left the company, there is no way this won't impact the development. 
---
I'll be completely honest. Of all the firings this is probably the one I feel it was most deserved. It's obviously that Gaile wasn't that good at her job anymore, mostly due to the change of times and it was also obvious that she had some sort of "veteran protection" and, as such, probably a fat paycheck.
---
So, while I can't really celebrate someone losing his job (especially a non-developer), I also won't "mourn" this loss.
---
why not both
---
[https://twitter.com/GaileGray/status/1100145809914392576](https://twitter.com/GaileGray/status/1100145809914392576)

---
xD,so it was ready and now it isnt ready,rofl rip anet it was good ride.
---
9k in GW2, 4k in GW. Many more to come. 
---
So the day you get to know that you will very likely loose your job, and you have payment, family and a house to take care of and no knowledge about the future. Obviously you will be worried about what to expact and talk to the company in meetings and so on. 
---
But when that happens your project is about to go up so your boss tell you well dude this is your job, i dont care if you might get fired, do it. And you would be all like yeah ofc i will do that cause it is my job, maybe...
---
Get your stuff together and realise that this is a real life matter with real people having a really shitty time that could wreck their future if it does not work out.
---
I was under the impression that it was just them shifting back from being their own publisher (which they'd peeled off from NCSoft previously to do).
---
A guild that has Jadexi in it... 
---
Spin off from NCsoft the losing business and go public
---
If things keep going at this pace, it will certainly die off
---
I want to sail through this, but NCsoft is brewing a pretty big storm right now...
---
GUILD WARS 2 projects will not be affected. Guess its time to wait for the next episode see if there is a wing and leave if there isn't. 
---
Shit. I worked with Grant and he was one of the most competent guys on our team (diff industry, but still). Got shit done.
---
So not only did they remove a ton of their best talent, now some of the rest are volunteering to leave too? Well, NCSoft have certainly done a masterful job of shooting themselves in the foot.
---
raid wing will be earliest with next living world patch, if not the one after that (voice acting takes ages)  
---
Though, I'm starting to believe that NCSoft considers Raids/fractals as one of the side projects, which deletes my only interest in the game
---
in either pvp or wvw, you need to learn combinations, how to use the utility in your skills, and how to recognize the windows where you'll get the most value out of these while fighting other players. it's a lot more complicated than just knowing a rotation. best way to learn this is to play every class into every class.
---
Well, to be fair, people not working on GW2 could be brought onto the project. That or they could end up porting content for NCsoft so it can die in our market.
---
&gt; Go play some other games then buddy.
---
Fuck off, we need more people playing, not less. This kind of fanboy responses where you shutdown criticism instead of addressing it will never help anyone.
---
I think this is the pretty clearest example of where the corners are being cut. I really don't know anything about the situation, but I have to imagine Gaile's tenure at the company means she was worth more than NCSoft thought she offered. Basically, shuffling out devs that are "too expensive." Very cutthroat and disappointing.
---
Not that it makes it sting any less, but I don't believe this is the first time we've "lost" Gaile? I may be mis-remembering but I thought she left before GW2 launched, and then came back a couple years later. 
---
That's awesomely accurate!
---
The heavy hitters might have started looking for employment elsewhere after the news broke and thus volunteered to leave instead of another person getting fired.
---
Now do you see why I'm angry?!
---
Does every post on reddit have to have this comment?
---
That's not true.
---
To be fair many of those folk have been shifted away from GW2 in favor of the ominous side projects.
---
Still these are very talented people that could have been a huge boon to GW2's future and instead of being shifted back they are let go.
---
I'm all for promoting a game, but this just isn't true.
---
Does ESO offer a free trial?
---
400 is official number.
---
Why? She did literally nothing considering game development
---
clearly over 15k... no life without being able to play a mesmer anymore :(

What is SAB?

Anything is possible with a mesmer :P
---
as someone who just came back to GW2 after a long haitus, what is currently happening with arenanet and what does the future look like for gw2?  Id hate to find out I came back just as the game was gonna lose all its devolopers and stop udates.
---
"gw2 wont be affected"
---
What is special anout gaile? She wasnt a dev.
---
I’ll be completely honest..you r a jerk..

you are braindead kid,with  0 understanding of real world. go for your mom and drink some milk from her titis.

it's not gonna get much extra updates, definitely not world 3

TROLLS
---
Peter Fries didn't personally attack anyone and only tried to protect a coworker who fucked up. He is one of the coolest devs i've ever seen.

This. Create your own group and set the standards you want to see. I always do this when I play fractals and dungeons. Everyone has a chill, fun time.

"I volunteered"
---
seems like gw2 devs got to chose between getting less paid and stay or get fired
---
(100% speculation on my part!!!!)
---
No
---
People in top wvw guilds are the vast minority, to be fair.
---
Of course I have to learn a lot about the Ranger and I suppose the build depends on how I play (better or worse). But for what I am seeing PowerDPS is my best option. Thanks you!
---
Admittedly true. 
---
Still a day of bad news. 
---
&gt; Gotta focus on what's important right now
---
Keeping the company alive and stopping the momentum so it doesn't completely crash after this. That's what's important.
---
Try caring about those who were not fired a bit, too, because if things do not improve, the whole company will end up closed.
---
Suck it up? I've been sobbing like a child when I read Gaile and Josh were fired... They've enriched this game, community and my life for years... I'm so fucking angry and sad at the same time...
---
Sad to see you go. Any chance you can get the bird instability to volunteer to go too?
---
Ffs, time to stop really. BS that this layoffs won't affect GW2.
---
No one did.
---
Great work OP
---
WHAT Gaile Gray IS arenanet omg I’m so sad
---
So they still have 300 people?
---
I mean,  that's a lot of people for a supposedly dead game. /s 
---
I think we all assumed that some big names would be part of the group leaving Anet. 
---
But Gaile? Gaile who was essentially the main communicator between Anet and players? Just a dumb move to let her go. One of Anet’s weak points has always been communication and oftentimes Gaile was the only person to even acknowledge the player base directly. Hell, sometimes it was just pr talk but at least it was some form of communication. 
---
I’m just an armchair quarterback in this whole thing but I don’t get this one; Gaile should have been spared. 
---
sorry hes losing his job but he had extreme sjw tendencies so it is probably for the best that he wont be working on the game
---
But then again if the dedicated players were not there, WvW would not be WvW at all because noone would be there to organise it for the people who comes every now and then and everything on the map would be paper and no life on it at all except for a few people who roam here and there but also them usually would move to a more populated server. Because there is a difference between a dead server and a less populated.
---
So in the end it really should be what WvW players need and not what those who are not very active want. 
---
My biggest problem with this layoff is the initial messaging implied people for the publishing components (marketing, polish, etc.) would be "consolidated" with NCsoft's teams, which alright isn't awful and kinda makes sense. But so far, the people who have admitted to being laid off are CREATIVE people, not related to publishing in any way. They are the heart and the soul of the game, and I've noticed a commonality that a lot of the longstanding veterans are being laid off. Whether that's a coincidence or intentional because they make too much money from their tenure, we may never know.   
---
This is incredibly worrisome, and shows that NCsoft does not actually care about the heart of the game, of people who have dedicated their life to the game when they could have gone to other companies that pay infinitely more money than the pennies Anet already paid their devs.
---
You've never had to submit a support ticket have you? :))))))))))))))))
---
Agreed.  For those they don't get severance, unemployment (assuming they qualify) can make a night vs day difference.
---
In the very least it would be nice to know what the method for obtainment will be, and this announcement or another small update could have given a quick idea about it.
---
As it stands I'm unsure whether to be excited or pass this content up if it requires rank 1200 like some unfounded rumors claim.
---
It's a difficult time for Anet, of course. But it's also frightening time for fans. We need a bit more effort to communicate. It would go a long way
---
Ohyeah, I forgot about the precursor collections in HoT that ended up getting severely diminished. That's even a separate thing from what I was talking about.
---
What a devastating loss for the community. Gaile was the greatest.
---
I'm with you on the minstrel gear. I will never tryhard this game again as long as minstrel exists. fuck minstrel gear.
---
as for the pvp system for builds, sure. why not? let's at least try it.
---
I can play my plain full Harrier Healbrand PvE Build in WvW? It feels squishy af in sPvP and requires lots of coordinated Teamplay.
---
Best of luck in all your endeavors from now on and always. Thank you for making this magic world what it is today.
---
Thank you for inspiring us all, and thank you for inspiring me.
---
Oh my god
---
More like NCSoft said no :/
---
Aprils fools festival, super adventure box. There were supposed to be 4 worlds, but there are only 2 available
---
It's a video game. Not an essential service. Get some perspective.
---
Yep.  That seems to be the jist of it.  NCSoft must have assessed the project and said "Yeah this is enough content to bring in money without support.  Just keep a guy rotating the store and it should be k".  Absolutely undignified these practices
---
Fuck off if you want to criticize do it in a constructive way. If you call that criticism then you should really take a deep look at yourself and try to find a brain.
---
What a great way to resolve the situation. What a pathetic display of leadership by Mike O'Brien and Mike Z. Let people volunteer for lay-offs? You are running a fucking company you fucking chimplords.
---
Arenanet just lost its most gifted developer. Because he volunteered so that others wouldn't lose their job.
---
I'm quitting the game until either Mike O'Brien or Mike Z resigns.
---
This happens in any industry with any type of development. Not just gaming. 
---
Super Adventure Box. Josh was essentially the one-man army behind it.
---
what
---
20,739 hours in gw2, and I DONT regret a second, this game helped me get up when times were especially though and taught me important skills like communication and planning, aswell as opened my minds more to the opinions of other people.
---
1400-ish hours in gw1.
---
While im critical of the company at times, this is very hard to watch as a fan of this great game..
---
I'm getting a hard time with my gear so I think gear x2 right now is not possible. But, yeah for sure I want to learn both. I appreciate your insight. Thanks you! 
---
/salute
---
It seems that the whole thing is as much as a surprise for MO as everyone else ... Which means he could have very well heard one thing last week and it happens to be worse. It also means that he had no time to prepare the restructuring and making sure all skills&amp;knowledge about the game and its systems are retained within the company.
---
Also expensive though. 
---
They can be replaced at lower cost - ie newer people. 
---
Will they be as good? Maybe,  maybe not. They could be better. 
---
The younger talent will get their shot now I suppose. 
---
Any good MMOs around? Mine's dying
---
Get out.
---
No, but base game is like 5$
---
Meh so are you. 
---
&gt; In any case it's unprofessional from NCSoft or Anet's part to cause this much unneeded drama, especially during a crucial time like this when player confidence is needed. 
---
This. The company should be showing strength in these moments, not weakness and chaos.
---
They want us to believe GW2 isn't dying and yet all the devs we know and love are leaving in droves... This is very bad.
---
I don't believe that's an accurate interpretation.  A subsidiary (ArenaNet) typically does the best it can to meet its holding company's (NCSoft's) goals and projections.  While it's tempting to blame a subsidiary for any and all under-performance, often times the financial problems turn out to be a product of poor economic and financial forecasting on the part of the parent company.
---
For example, a parent company may promise shareholders a specific return on their investment (e.g., +2.75 per share), but fail to give its subsidiaries the tools, finding, personnel, and other resources that they need to deliver on the parent company's promise.
---
The idea that poor management at ArenaNet is the cause of such large layoffs is rather simplistic, and doesn't take into consideration the greater complexities of corporate funding and structure.
---
Yes, that's what I am doing. LW3 maps are saving me. Thanks you!
---
It's called having empathy. Try it sometime.
---
Gaile was the greatest and I was fortunate enough to have met and interacted with her personally a few times. What a devastating loss for the community. 
---
That's not even his first account
---
Legend has it that somewhere out there in the Mists there exists a lost sixth piece, known only as "Little D".
---
Which part of it? Wow declined to around 3m after bfa
---
Some people think it went like this:
---
Before: 
---
 * 100 at GW2
---
 * 300 at 2 unknown projects:
---
After: 
---
* 300 at GW2.
---
I'm not so sure myself.
---
No it hasn't.
---
Can he take instabilities with him?
---
&gt;kindhearted 
---
&gt;billionaire
---
Pick one.
---
Says the person commenting about OPs timing.  At least he did something productive.  
---
Well I wasn’t panicking before, kind of am now.
---
Horrible situation really, I hope those devs can get back on there feet soon.
---
Perhaps but I'm more familiar with gaming industry cycles than anything else so I spoke on that.
---
NOOOO =(
---
Time to squeeze out some last karma
---
I really hate to ask this considering the circumstances, but as players we're feeling this just as much as you guys. Do you have any inkling of what this might mean for the content you've worked on or had planned? I totally understand if it's not something you can or would say anything about, or if it's left to ArenaNet to recoup and decide when the time is right to say something. We're just also trying to find some direction. 
---
You've been a treasure and I really wish you the best. As someone who's always loved the idea of working for ArenaNet the work you guys did means everything. 
---
patch notes preview^maybe?
---
I feel you. If this means the game will take a different direction, I mean, I'll take it. If this didnt happen and the game kept going as it was, I probably would never come back. Now I have at least a sliver of hope that the people at NCSoft will try to balance PvP/WvW, release replayable content and improve the story. Cause I know the pre-disaster ANet wouldnt.
---
Guild Wars 1 was my first MMO and literally saved me from being all alone during early teens. 
---
I've about an hour a day in GW2 since its release (day one, with some beta shennanigans as well).
---
So many great devs, wish you the best but you're gonna be missed in GW.
---
Understandable. They shouldn't push it over the next few days, taking a step back is a *good thing* while they recalibrate. #Love4ArenaNet
---
Please be respectful over the next week. Your fears are founded, but GW2 isn't "dying" or going anywhere. They do need to communicate their next steps to ease our tensions, BUT please, *please* be respectful right now. Those who remain had to watch a portion of their colleagues leave this morning, they can't focus. This was out of the blue for them. The best thing we can do as a community is support the studio, support those who were laid off, and be patient. Constant, hyper negativity will only fuel further disarray.  
---
From a far more economic stance...you don't know who all had to walk out the door and who had their hands on this release. Aside from the emotional impact of the departures, which (to me) is reason enough for a delay, you don't know what technical mess it could have turned into if they needed last minute adjustments. When a release goes live there's no telling how it's going to mix with the servers, even after QA. 
---
Patience, give them a minute to adjust. See what they have to say. They are human, as are we. 
---
FFXIV has some bullshit sjw agenda running tho, new terms of service etc.
---
You might look into that before starting.
---
what was her contribution to the community lately? if any, she destroyed what was left of anet communication
---
Well you're all heart....
---
Some things to consider.
---
Yes, Fractal Ben, Josh Foreman, and Medina were some really good fucking developers, and it really fucking sucks they lost their jobs, but they more than likely got very lucrative buy out options.
---
Also those 3 combined take up probably what 7-8 brand new devs off the street would make.
---
You can say that those 7-8 devs don't have the talent or experience that those veterans had, and while that's true, those 7-8 devs have the potential to become those veterans at a fraction of the cost.
---
Also, Anet had \~400 people working for them, and now they are down to about \~300, which is still about the same size as what even the WoW dev team is. So GW2 can still survive, as long as they don't spread the team too thin to work on future projects.
---
There should be a strike on publishers more like.  Giving developers these hard deadlines and consequently bad releases seems like a running gag at this point.
---
I was doing solo Bitterfrost Frontier but if they are easy, I will switch between them also. For sure I will remain on LW3 maps I think. Thanks!
---
This is def the case. NCSoft has no control on who's critical and who's no. That's what local management is in for. Brian had to take action based on a budget, most likely. So they say they want 10% more revenue out of payroll, he can fire ten 1% or one 10% employee, but he has to get the %.
---
Did they let go any WvW developer staff??? 
---
What's that??
---
There never was any WvW developer staff?!?!?!
---
As someone who basically only stuck to GW2 for raids and fractals for the past 3 years, thank you for everything Ben. Your work and your involvment with the community were invaluable for this game.
---
I'm sure you made the right call, good luck on your next project. Please let us know where you land!

---
I've put a maximum of 300 hours on since gw2 released. So almost 10k hours in 7 years essentially. Unhealthy proportion of my childhood is in this game.
---
As a side note, if anyone I used to play with is reading this, reach out to me, I'd like to hang out again, you'd know me as Il Inuzuka Kiba Il, Jalis Ironhammers, Legion Destroyer Il, Lupine Cunning, M I N D F L A Y Ixl or Proximity Fuse 
---
This. Whatever you think about Gaile, she's been there since day one and is often the face or direct line of comms to gw2 devs. This is sad news.
---
How do all these stupid fuckin' comments end up making it to the top of the stack?  Don't you people have anything better to do than post 1-word answers to legitimate questions?  Grade school must be out somewhere.
---
No, the identity of E was never revealed.  As another user said, it appears to be a loose end that ArenaNet hasn't (yet?) cleaned up.  I always thought E might be countess Anise or Livia, both of whom turn out to be major players in season 3, but alas, there's no enough there to tie them in.  I'd also considered Evennia from GW1 - with her working together with Livia to direct the Shining Blade for all these years, and with Livia using the Scepter of Orr to keep them both alive.
---
It's worth reading the [Correspondence from E](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/E%27s_Correspondence) again after all this time to note how cryptic some of it is.  There's even mention of "your brother," but no indication of who the recipient or the brother may be.  Interesting stuff!
---
But feels over facts
---
Oh no!!! Not Josh. :( Didnt he also make the mad kings clock tower jumping puzzle?
---
Reported 
---
3571 hours over 154 months for GW (however my first accound was hacked, I had it since October 2005 and it had a bit more than a 1000 hours).
---
And 1984 hours over 2375 days for GW2. I really hope I will be able to get a lot more hours out of both those games and any future game Anet makes...
---
Are you retarded? See, this is hateful.
---
I'm sorry, but we can't do much. They won't care, believe me.
---
They cut gaile gray. This is so sad. I remember they made her a special mini pet in gw1 for her 
---
Really sad news . I haven't played the game in a while due to personal issues bit logging on to get episodes. I hope the studio doesn't close
---
First, anyone who works for a game developer company is a 'dev'.  I assume what you mean is she wasn't a 'programmer'. 
---
Second, the fact that you had to ask what is special about Gaile shows that you never had the privilege of getting to meet and interact with her.
---
Without a doubt, Gaile was the heart and soul of the gaming community for ANet, way back from GW1 and the Frog to the present day.  Her absolute devotion to the community made her, imho, ANet's biggest asset.  There is no other person like her, and she cannot be replaced.
---
Panic time is probably over.  Sit and wait for the game to die is in place.  Let the cash grab gem store game begin.
---
Not to be that guy but the only reason NC soft did what they did is because the game wasn't doing as well as it could, which is technically the studio's responsibility 
---
*Sold out
---
That was your decision and yours alone. Don't blame them for it.
---
Saddest news,
---
Yeah, it's almost like corporations don't care *at all* about loyalty or service or ethics or any of that. Their values are to maximize profits and that's it. 
---
&gt;We won't be removing any criticism
---
like you remove my mene (about ArenaNet)?
---
Unknown projects got cancelled
---
They got rid of the workers for the other projects that they suspended indefinitely. 
---
You know the parent company is NCSoft, right? If anything, the lootboxes are likely to be doubled.
---
You are complaining about an MMO that was advertised for casuals giving handouts and then compared it to society at large. If you want a little challenge in your video-game oriented life then go Max out a HCIM on OSRS, go get Golden Warden on RS3, get Pen gear in BDO, go beat a Souls game at SL 1, do a naked Rajang hunt on Monster Hunter, do a speed run of Battletoads, do a no death run on Ninja Gaiden, get Divine on Dota 2, take over the world in Europa Universalis. There are literally thousands of different games in a variety of genres made throughout the decades where you can find the videogame challenge that you are looking for. 
---
Josh was also a very important veteran.
---
No doubt the ANet that we are going to see moving forward is going to be a very different one, probably a shadow of the current one.
---
We probably won't see the effects on the next episode as it should be fairly advanced by now, but the next season... and we can forget about the next expansion probably.
---
It's a pity because GW2 was doing fairly well, all numbers considered.
---
IMO the forums are ran horribly. This subreddit is where its at to actually make engaging discussions as well as  shit post too.
---
There had to be some really terrible decisions made for this to happen. The community is the only truly important feature of any MMO since it's the only part we get to take with us after the game's gone, and the top of that pyramid just got chopped off. 
---
Gaile, none of the GW games would be what they were without you. Double the well-wishes back your way, you'll be missed.
---
It's tough, but I don't know that it's that dire. I saw it as a positive, that the company cares enough about their (remaining) employees' mental health that they're giving people some room.
---
They never said everything was going to be fine, just that GW1/2 stuff wasn't going to be touched. Now, if they aren't lying about that, understand that the layoffs we're seeing are an example of the devs who have been siphoned off from GW2 for the now-failed side projects.
---
What's unfortunate is that people have begun to doubt that they're telling the truth. In the end, it's chaos right now and now is not really the time to proclaim the game dead. The people who are leaving aren't lying. The remaining devs are/have/will do amazing work. Just because someone is popular with the community doesn't mean they are extra talented or otherwise special aside from being more outgoing.
---
I'm still optimistic, mostly because the lead game designer kept her job and she has been amazing today tweeting out crisis hotlines and getting Love4ArenaNet trending. This is a day to say goodbye to old favorites. Tomorrow is the day to say hello to new friends.
---
Thread removed: Duplicate post, please check the recent posts for a similar one and use that. This includes making a comment post about a another post.
---
Completely understandable. I'm glad they're taking time to recover from this and I wish them all the best!
---
Gaile Grey was let go.
---
Are you fucking kidding me?
---
I don't wanna touch the game right now. 
---
I'm not some naysayer who thinks GW2 is ending. But to get rid of someone so devoted...she's been a constant since before I got into the Gw series back in 2007. 
---
I'm so upset. 
---
We were at the point where the coffin was buried but we kinda hoped someone would go grave robbing
---
I have plenty of sympathy for everyone. IMO, canceling stuff this week was correct, people need to process what's going on.
---
Yeah I mean, those ones sure deserve a ban, but I've seen some people make very valid points about certain devs, but that can also be seen as Hate, which is what I was basing my comment on.
---
I think it's kind of... dumb? I'm missing a word that's more on point, because I understand you, some people are animals that shouldn't be let near a pc, but on the other hand, people should be able to vent and discuss. Especially in a situation when we've just lost the people responsible for the best parts of this game, raids and fractal CMs. Which probably spells no decent content for people who are not content with tapping 1 on Gerent.
---
From my last post:
---
&gt; What about jumping puzzles? damn I miss those, where are you Josh? 
---
Now I know. :(
---
From all the people this saddens me the most. 
---
On the other hand, as he's a true artist I'm interested what he does next. If any kickstarters or games are on the horizon I'll throw money at you Josh!
---
How are either of those comments indicative of a bad life? Sounds like you're trying to invalidate what they say while disguising it by virtue signalling.
---
I'm kinda disappointed they don't have contingency plans for stuff like this.
---
Still, NCSOFT really choose a bad time to do this.
---
NCSoft doesn't give a shit about what you or anyone thinks. You can try to start a bandwagon all you want but it will literally do nothing. This isn't the first time NCSoft has done something like this and it absolutely won't be the last.
---
it's an usual thing on medium/big companies. When you have to lay off a good chunk of people just because you can't maintain so many workers it's usual to ask for voluntaries first. Voluntaries get better conditions for the lay off and this way the company doesn't have to choose as many people at random.
---
He had it in his personal blog. The wife was apparently an addict and gamed the system's usual favoring of maternal custody in family court to try to separate him from his children, and Anet gave Josh the stability he needed to prove his fitness for custody.
---
You then follow his channels and see just what an amazing and loving dad he is. He is utterly devoted to his children.
---
Gw1 players would likely connect more due to her being the main communication then and would chat to players and they had a special event just for her
---
Well 
---
Even though I started my adventure with Guild Wars franchise two years ago, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot for all of the adventures you have provided me.
---
&lt;3
---
 /salute
---
she didn't "fuck up" and you know it. She's an antagonistic asshole and has lost previous jobs to said behavior and will absolutely lose future ones as well.
---
Why not? Gw2 is sinking down, fast.
---
Do you think anyone bought this game for SAB? And I hated how it replaced the annual April 1st patches, used to love those. Never liked SAB, never will, it's massively overrated on reddit.
---
Fuck NCSoft. CoH, always remember.
---
I don't hate these people.
---
I just regret everything.
---
All the money, all the time, all the emotional investment. I want it back.
---
I wanted this game to keep me happy through college, keep me stable even, but NC drives every game they touch into the ground. Knowing my characters might not let me escape into Tyria in a year or two... it's just crushing. I don't want it to end this way. I wanted to see Aurene come back somehow, let the commander deal with all their trauma, and let the story come to a natural close. 
---
To a publisher like NCSoft no amount of success will ever be "as well as it could" be.
---
Can we hate on NcSoft tho?
---
Yes we can, just stop spending money on NCsoft games, easy and simple, enjoy the f2p or even p2p, but stop spending money on those stupid and usless skins etc
---
my opinion is as valid as yours and i'm not being disrespectful, i can say what i want, where i want as long as im not insulting anyone
---
Well someone has an axe to grind. 
---
You can spell "shut up" nicely, doesn't make you right.
---
Josh Foreman and Gaile Grey....damn. this...is awful 
---
Also ANet was still making a decent bit of money, which plays into what you said about it not being their fault alone. I guess they didn't meet requirements of profit, while still making profit, so NCSoft is cutting costs to get the required profit they want to see. What companies that do this often fail to see is however that what they're cutting is potential future income that's being scrapped. 
---
Who is Notch? 
---
Just as with BLIZZARD i guess. 
---
&gt; Supply flow is radically more constrained on DBL than it is on Alpine because of how the yaks have to visit the various towers in cycle rather than simply fanning out. I imagine this was an intentional choice, since it means that it's relatively easy to supply-starve things, particularly keeps. 
---
Yaks on DBL north camp fan out to towers are seperate from those that fan out to garri. On alpine north towers are supplied by 1, and not 2 yaks; only from north camp, and they go to garri after that. Unlike desert bl where both camps provide 2 yaks going to more places. So eh what the fuck you on about? 
---
 North camp supplies garri with supply significantly faster on desert bl due to distance as well. 
---
&gt; The fact that interactions are limited to yak pathing produces a highly dull "starve the objective" meta, which naturally favors roamers and bores zergs. The fact that the pathing is terrible makes it very difficult for even willing zergs to *find*one another, much less engage in meaningful fighting without cancer chokes or auras/siege mucking it up, and also proportionally favors havoc. 
---
Because those are willing to run in circles repeatedly avoiding engagements unless they are favourable. Which is entirely fine except detrimental to group play. So you can keep saying "its not defensive!!!!" because it works out for 5 man havoc ... But for any group it's a sludge to get in with no chance at a fight BECAUSE they can't get inside and force a fight in a reasonable time. 
---
Something they clearly can do in alpine. 
---
&gt; It's not overly defensive. Flipping tier 3 is quite a bit easier and more direct on every DBL keep (but especially the non-Air ones) than it is with any keep on Alpine. It's just that you won't get decent fights out of it, so… why bother? 
---
I actually agree on this. But not because of the reason you stated, it's certainly overly defensive. The fact that you can't clear excess siege on any walls or gates forces you to play drawn out supply games. Which is just retarded. For groups controlling the lordsrooms is certainly worse too. Exception being DBL garri of course.
---
You see if you have half decent defenders on any of them, then sorry but bay is easier than both fire and air. I agree alpine garri is worse. I also agree that desert bl garri is the most doable - if you can get inside. How aids hills is depends on to which extent defenders are willing to camp the choke; but once you clear them out it's done. 
---
I don't think "killing air lord" is difficult. I think "controlling air lordsroom while dealing with 1 or 2 equal sized zergs repeatedly building siege and rerunning / ressing / contesting indefinitely" is more aids. Big difference. In hills you get into the lordsroom and clear it out and they won't be taking it back easily. In bay it's similar but they have more avenues of defense, but also of attack. Lord room still clearable. In desert bl? Yeah goodluck. 
---
Supply drain wars work if the map is queue'd. If not they can take supply from other maps almost indefinitely, past the time where I can be bothered. Works if you're 5v5'ing for a keep because 5 players can't just run 1k supply. Doesn't work if you're 30v30 because they can just port in 750 supply andddd you can stall another 1-2 hours. Horray fun gameplay hurdur monkaS. You can supply drain maps for 2-3 hours in drawn out siege wars and frankly, it's so boring nobody wants to bother with that shit.
---
Supply was something that went out the moment as soon as upgrading allowed you to keep full supply AND upgrades at the same time; and supply generates faster on desert bl as long as they can keep northcamp.  
---
Ultimately, both bay and hills are easier than desert bl keeps if they are defended. Properly. However, and that's the amazing thing about desert bl. Due to its nature favoring defenders and siege warriors to exceptional levels, most groups that play here are among the worst group-fighting players in the game. For EU I can mention piken and FIRE guild loving it... Not exactly groups that put up a proper fight without their acs. 
---
And that's why I agree desert bl keeps flip easier than alpine ones. Not because they're harder to defend. Genuinely the only one that is easier is dbl garri. But because the players that play the groups that go there to hide and ktrain are generally the players that NEED these bonusses not to get farmed 24/7. And yet somehow, they still do.
---
Weird how that works. 
---
She might have been something in gw1 times, but for gw2 she is responsible for crippling and later destroying anet2customer communication, not to mention her magnum opus called "nazi state forums".
---
ANet's work was inaffective. Too much work was put to internal projects and not the game itself. NCSoft want's them to focus again. They gonna lay off people related to side projects but some veterans, for what ever reason, volunteered. There is nothing you can do about it nor is it wrong from NCSoft. Loosing a job sucks, nyt ANet just hasn't produced to keep everyone they've hired.
---
Never liked her anyways and always thought she had a shit attitude over the past six years. Still a dick move to fire her on Anets part but as I've said before I hope this is a new start.  I'm not the only one who's unhappy with the direction this game has taken for years now. 
---
Well not just to a publisher, there are several fans (myself included) who thinks the game has suffered from a chain of poor decisions for the past few years
---
Thank you for this.  I have had the privilege to get to meet many of the ANet team over the years, and while I'm not a fan of all of them, I would wish this on none of them.  
---
ty ben for fractals, watch out for birds wear that hat you got on your avatar it might spook them. :)
---
it's sad that it was needed clarification but yeah already saw people posting how some deserved firing :( 
---
The future looks bleaker than the prospects of an unvaccinated child in polio treatment ward. On Pluto.
---
They've lost Josh (one of the best damn level designers I've ever seen, and has been with the company since GW1), and a big chunk of their raid and fractals teams, as well as Gaile Gray (a much loved community manager, also from all the way back in GW1)
---
I'm practical. Keeping gaile for so long was opposite to being practical.
---
11,891 hours since launch, I hope many more hours to come..
---
Criticism is perfectly fine even if it's angry. Just blatantly throwing hateful speech or threats will not be allowed. 
---
&gt; Yes we can, just stop spending money on NCsoft games, easy and simple, enjoy the f2p or even p2p, but stop spending money on those stupid and usless skins etc
---
Good luck telling the Asian mobile market to stop spending money on NCSoft bullshit, because that's where most of it comes from.
---
Old School Runescape is in a great spot now also
---
We're about to see a real content drought now, rip
---
Seems like pot and kettle situation with you and your post :)
---
&gt;i know
---
But all those fractals have been there with no new updates in a long time...
---
Even ffxiv can push out some new dungeons every few months.
---
Well this is getting increasingly bad.
---
Yea, people seem to forget the outcry there was against raids as people came to this game to avoid raiding communities. 
---
This is why, because now Anet has created a disparity in content difficulty and rewards leading to this toxic divide. 
---
go take a look at the raises their execs got last year and tell me that
---
Not really sure where I said I was being constructive either. I was simply replying to a random asshole who has nothing to bring to the table and yet tried to sit on it.
---
&gt; Telling people to stop playing the game sounds like a pretty constructive reply, indeed.
---
Grow up, people won't stop playing because you tell them to and they won't start playing for the same reason. If they stop or start its usually because they feel like doing it.
---
I am sad, what type of world is it where the guy that started the whole security spyware fiasco with the false bans (empty string thing) gets to stay? :( It just sucks Josh Foreman, Gaile Gray , all the other amazing talent is leaving. 
---
yea, I'm really upset.
---
FFXIV is 2ed most played mmo next to wow there no "stagnating". ESO players always try make there game seem larger then it is.
---
Idk but im feeling that it will be a downhill from here......
---
.
---
I know that moral ins't great at the studio but you cant say that the services will not be affected and, in the next days have postpone updates, have a lot of known people beening layingoff and actually belive that all will be ok...
---
I love Gw2 but with the current state of the game and those news, I decided to leave the game, ty for all the devs and other anet employees that provide me the best 6 years of my live, but something you gotta know when to do is get out the boat before you really drown, i rather leave the game now with acceptance, than later, pissed off and even more disappointed.
---
I'm not saying that those news are the only reason, but the news + the direction that the game was going on the past 2 \~ 3 years made my decision a lot of ezier.
---
Ty also for the community that besides the raiding elitism shit, is one into the mmorpg genre.
---
I could eat alphabet soup and shit out more coherent sentences than you. 
---
Spoke too soon...
---
Feels like they've cut the heart out of the game.
---
&gt; If I have a small fitness goal does it "detracts" your big fitness goal? The answer should be no.
---
Absolutely. Just like a casual raider should not detract from a speedrunner. That said, the weakness in my own argument here is what I set up elsewhere; in the game, the reward for casuals and speedrunners is identical. Should it be?
---
It's the same weakness you're absolutely right in noting about the weight lifting part in general - it was just what came to mind, and I'm sure with proper/more developed thought a better structured analogy could absolutely be made. I still feel it's better to compare a video game to a hobby of any kind than to a job or to employment.
---
That is your real life and i feel for you, and that is my contribution to you. Have a nice evening :)
---
F
---
No. Just what I said
---
10 skills on your bar, weapon swap, profession skills (ranging from 1 to 5 extra skills), jump, dodge, mount, interact. You'd need 16-17 buttons just for all of that
---
You may be projecting condescension onto my words, but I assure you none exists on my part. I could be wrong about his intent as well, but the full context of his post history does not lead me to believe that is the case.

Still remember that event. 
---
I didn't interact with her more than a handful of times in GW1, but in 2 we talked quite a bit.
---
I'll never forget the time she and I talked for almost 2 hours in a snowy divinity's reach in 2016 about life and disney. It wasn't related to the game at all. It wasn't her being a PR person. She was just another person in the game talking to me and it was super special. 
---
We kept in touch some after that. Always good times. 
---
Why do so many HP trains in Heart of Thorns expect me to have a griffon and all of the way points already? I've tried for a few days now to get one for the Tangled Depths that I can do but either there isn't one at all during the window I can play or the ones I've joined abandon players ASAP when they can't griffon fly or teleport to a way point somewhere really far away.
---
It's demoralizing when you combine it with the constant need to stop progressing the story to grind masteries that I feel punished for even attempting to try to enjoy the story in the order it was released.
---
Valid point. I'm also one of those people by extent (GW1 vet, GW2 since beta), so it's not that I don't understand that people are worried. It's more to the people that are spewing hate and trying to discredit and bring down devs and the company that this is aimed at. Should've clarified that in my initial comment.
---
Topkek
---
So be it. I'll be coming back only for new ls release. I can't just praise how good gw2 is any more if we have no idea what and why is going out. Official ncsoft statement would be cool.
---
Wait have they been fired by arenanet? How can you fire people like gailey who worked for 18 at arenanet? Do we not need a community manager anymore? Or did those people decide to go and quit their jobs? I’m so confused.
---
One possible thing this indicates is that someone above ANet basically told ANet that they were only going to get X amount of budget for salary to pay their employees. And that this amount is less than what it currently costs to pay their current employees at their current salaries. This means people need to take salary cuts so that no one needs to be let go, people need to leave the company so that others can stay, or people just wait around and let management do the hard job of figuring out who gets to stay and who leaves.  
---
When a company team faces financial hardship, either because the company is failing/having a bad quarter, or because of budget cuts from higher-up, it's usually beneficial to everyone all around if the more experience and better paid employees leave so that 2-3 newer, less paid employees may keep their jobs.  
---
This is because if you're well paid and been with the company for 10+ years, you're very likely to find a well paying job somewhere else. However, if you're a fresh employee with 2-3 years experience and maybe a pay raise or two, then it's much more difficult for you to find a job somewhere else.  
---
As such, often times the more experienced employees will volunteer to leave to save the jobs of a few, because tight knit teams like that often care about each other. It's mutual in that regard.  
---
That's my personal speculation, at least. I don't think these big name employees were directly targeted by NCSoft/ANet to be fired, and could very well explain why they are volunteering to leave. If so, then this means ANet/GW2 is probably getting less funding.
---
Cant even bring my thoughts to words anymore..
---
At least I will have another week to farm rank.
---
missed out on a lot of good content, if you like instanced group content
---
[Ben is volunteer to be on the list.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/atbjm5/developer_appreciate_call_outs/eha0r4a/)    
---
Does this mean that NCSoft lied about GW2 not being effected?  Or they are shuffling people where GW2 won't be effected (assumes people on unannounced projects will take over who on GW2 got laid off)
---
&gt; It is beneficial because might and other sources of power cause ferocity to start returning more dps than power at a certain point
---
Yes, but it's a *very high* point. Very few builds would benefit from this
---
I love all my toys and tonics.  WvW is great
---
Indeed, but their quest is short-term and short-sighted and the obsession for "maximized revenue" always comes to no revenue unless you own something truly transcendent that can weather any storm and continue to grow... which we haven't seen yet so it may not exist. Not even WoW (in this industry) is that anymore.
---
As Jim Sterling likes to say, they don't want most of the money they want ALL the money and it's a fool's errand in the end.
---
*jerkoff motion*
---
And yet chris "fuckup with spyware and be an asshat when people call him on it" is still employed. I said it then and I'll say it now: when they fire HIM for being a dick to players, then the other firings were justified. Until then those two other ones show that hr  have their priorities mixed up.
---
Rendering, uploading, deciding if we do more, writting post, waiting for a proper posttime and not just post it during a reddit downtime where noone sees it
---
Nazis is a pretty common term on platforms where you want to describe people who can't take criticism and just ban you.
---
I would celebrate thier free speech. Seriously though people need to learn to accept criticism especially of someone's work. If you don't like a painting at a museum and celebrate when it's down because that means there will be something else that you might enjoy would you really consider that hateful behavior?!
---
That sounds like an excellent way to get ANet closed completely.
---
Yes, I'm delusional to think that a complete restructure in a game's dev team could change the content they produce. Yes, that's absolutely unreasonable. Go blindly hate NCSoft for being an ~~efficient~~ greedy, evil company elsewhere, I'm done here.
---
hahahahaa
---
Thank you for posting this. I really appreciate it.

It's completely the other way around. Lack of support for existing game was because Anet shifted focus. NCSoft is now pushing them back to the main game. Anet chose to "abandon" gw2 support for internal projects which now got cancelled.
---
I don't judge you, have a nice evening :)
---
I don't even give a fuck about the warclaw. 
---
The game being in this state will suck, sure, but I'm more devastated that so many longtime people are leaving/let go. 
---
Don't know that I can keep playing the game knowing the heart and soul of the series is gone. 
---
Remaining devs, take all the time you need..you've earned it
---
it sucks to get fired, but for everyone else who still has a job, yea, it's really important that they start getting their shit together and releasing content on time and communicating their plans for the future
---
if not, then it's only a matter of time before everyone gets to go find a new job
---
THANK YOU
---
Didn't City of Heroes get sued by Marvel in 2005? Might have left a bad taste in NCSofts mouth since they did settle and pay out
---
This. The game needs a roadmap to regain people's trust, and urgently.
---
Safe to say that Arena net is slowly being put down... I'm sad and kinda glad I lost interest in the game these past years, I couldnt bear to know that I wont see the conclusion of the elder dragons war
---
And hopefully they come with tools to break off the mortsafe around it. 
---
Ahh, NCSoft showing just how real cunts they are. Fuck you NCSoft!
---
A full rotation of Bitterfrost and Siren's takes about 15min per map. It usually nets me 45-50 berries for Bitterfrost when I do the forest on the left side of the map (about 10min). For Siren's, I get about 15 pearls for the full map rotation (15min), there is a picture on the orrian oyster wiki that shows you where you can find them. Ignore the Lyssa's temple and it's a solid 15 pearls per 15min. 200 pearls gets you a backpack, and 150 pearls gets you an amulet.
---
Draconis Mons is a bit trickier, there isn't a map location on the wiki, but it usually nets me 30 blossoms per run (20-30min). You need 100 of these for a ring and 150 for an amulet. 
---
Amulet: Draconis or Siren's
---
Backpack: Any (Siren's, Bitterfrost and Dorik +1)
---
Rings: Draconis and Bitterfrost or Fractals
---
Accessories: Bitterfrost and Guild Missions
---
Whoever you are: Thank you for your contribution to GW2. You contributed to an ecosystem of a game I spent years on, and helped to make a website as inspiring and full of art as the game.
---
This game died, when they stopped making new skin armors and only made full outfits. What a shame, fashion is precious and they shit on it, how dare you anet..
---
Happy to say that since this post was made things have calmed down immensely we had I think almost 200 reports before and only about 15-20 since and honestly that was the goal. Sometimes you just need to threaten people to not be an idiot to get them to think twice before doing something stupid. A very small group who specifically posted death threats were permanently banned. We've given out a few other temporary ones for incredibly hateful speech. Lot of things we're just removing but the majority of reports were approved and criticism and negativity is staying. We've also erased a few memes for just being low effort and not needed today. 
---
You can look around, there is a ton of negativity and I approved a lot of it. I'm just as scared and freaked out as everyone else right now, but at the same time I'm trying to do my job and make this an accepting place and people who dedicated their lives to this game and company don't deserve to be told they should die in poverty when they are getting laid off even if you hated their work as a dev. 
---
True, but that is also why it is a bit pathetic.
---
People in jobs that actually matter have to simply get on with it when things are difficult (including things that are lot more difficult than this), they can't afford to take time out to feel sorry for themselves.
---
What did he work on?
---
It's funny to see people complaining about this on this sub. GW2 has multiple gay couples in it and also has (had?) actual LGBT devs.
---
BTW games have been political in one way or another almost as long as they've existed. Just because you agree with the messages doesn't mean they aren't there. 
---
Jessica Price characterized it as that, and while she is a pretty dubious source, she *did* work on the LS teams so she would have firsthand knowledge. No, Anet doesn't deserve all the blame, but the head honchos deserve *a lot* of it. We know Anet had a lot of slack since NCsoft was letting them be their own publisher, and we also know that GW2, while still profitable, was making a lot less money than it used to. Anet struggles to release shit at the best of times, and the powers that be somehow thought they could split their attention between two different new projects with just enough effort put in to GW2 that no one would notice. It was a ridiculous choice, and it sucks that it blew up because now Anet is in a way worse spot but... we need to acknowledge why this even happened. 
---
Didn't know they got sued o.o
---
Then they just stop catering towards western market and only focus on the eastern market.
---
I bet they took a spreadsheet, sorted it by age and salary and laid them off regardless of talent and value to the company.  They will just replace them with younger and cheaper workers.  Pretty sad.
---
I wasn't doubting the claim, just wanted to see the source.
---
Always remember. o7
---
You clearly didn't see all the name callings on this subreddit for some.  We are not really talking about criticism here. It's really hate speech towards them and not citisism that has happened in some cases here.
---
You speak like you think management just say "You know what, let's make something good today", and it happens, or you get a bad manager and everything is just shit and 100% their fault when the product is bad. If the quality of content was only based on the managers abilities then why would they bother with a hiring process, just get any old riff-raff and put their bums in chairs, the manager will take care of the project.
---
I've worked in game studios before, i don't think you know how these places work. Managers don't stand on a podium in the middle of the room with a physical manifestation of creative license, hammering people on the head with it whenever they have an independent thought.   
---
I've already said managers take the vast amount of the blame, but they are not the only ones to blame for poor work. You're deluded if you think that's the case. 
---
Wait has she been fired by arenanet? How can you fire people like gailey who worked for 18 at arenanet? Do we not need a community manager anymore? Or did she decide to go and quit her job? I’m so confused.
---
Investors, feedback from customers?
---
Get real.
---
Most of them dont even know the product itself. Not even NCSoft cares about feedback. The only feedback for them is income.
---
As far as their episodes have been released I'm betting the biggest part of ep 6 is done, though taking a 9 month per episode dev-time assumption and being 2 months away from release my guess is that the layoffs already effect this next episode severely.
---
Indeed. I'm so sad for the rest, but these two were my favourites (from Gw1 - Gaile - and Gw2 - Josh -)
---
&gt;First, anyone who works for a game developer company is a 'dev'.
---
Far too broad a definition that would end up including janitorial staff.
---
A "dev" is someone that is integral in the creative process, be it an artist, writer, programmer or designer. Community Relations managers don't really fit the bill because their job is to principally herd angry customers and avoid/mitigate riots.
---
I think I may be experiencing a bug. Wanted to check and see if anybody has had a similar experience, and if they had fixes.
---
To make a long story short, I did an event last night which magically scaled up despite me being the only person in the area (at least that I could see - it was the one where you fill up the golem in Rata Novus). I was quickly mauled to death by Chak despite being a minion necro that normally dances through hordes of them without too much trouble.
---
Befuddled, I dove right back in and died in a fire. After that, I fixed my gear, then I went right back in and died in a fire (again).
---
Since then normal enemies have seemed scarier. As if my gear was broken (if it is, the UI is lying to me), or as if they're scaling up. They hurt more than I remember. I haven't switched any gear stats so I can't really imagine what the cause would be.
---
"papa NCSoft, where are we going?"
---
Feels bad, man.
---
I ran into one in Tangled Depths yesterday where they were nice enough to not go so fast that those without mounts could catch up, and had mesmers set up portals for us to use. It's too bad that's apparently an exception.
---
Can we unfuck fractals now?
---
o7
---
I'M HERE TO BARGAIN, Mr dormammus assistent 
---
Pm me offer i got alot of shit so bring money 
---
he was one of the OG raid team members, specifically QA for raids/fractals in the HoT era
---
he also did design on nightmare/shattered observatory, and episode 2/episode 5 of this living story season according to wiki
---
This is most likely the class.
---
The naysayers and doombringers don't seem to get this 
---
Granted I'm not really feeling any motivation to play the game after finding out who got let go. So many long time people that we knew. 
---
But when you get used to t4 you're practically ready for raids, in fact, some fractals with certain instabilities (and even CM's) are much harder than half the raid bosses. The fact that people are terrible even in t4 shows that people join such content with wrong mindset. They are only focused on loot and cheesing it on the most brainless way possible (remember full reaper groups in HoT? I do, they were more popular than 200kp groups nowadays).
---
ALso fractal tiers did nothing to introduce you to t4 difficulty nor mechanics since you could do them without paying attention. I did tons of low level fractals as f2p and got molested when I finally joined t4 because I had no idea what certain mechanics were, even if I thought I knew them pretty well. I got used to t4 because I played t4 over and over again, not because I did hundreds of t2/t3 ones. All they ever provided me were achievement points and collections, not any kind of training.
---
One of the devs of "All or Nothing"
---
She was a community manager in GW2, and more of a friend of the community in GW1, which is why this will be a hard blow for any fans from the original game. She regularly came into Lion's Arch in GW1 as a frog in game and just hung out and chatted with players. Although she may not have been a developer, this one is a real gut puch, right in the feels.
---
It's awesome that \~100 people working a game we all love lost their jobs and your immediate instinct is to worry about Muh Censorship. Truly, you're a hero to all. Grow up, your opinion ain't near as precious as you think it is.
---
First, please keep in mind that corporate restructuring happens all the time. Every company that I've ever worked for has layoffs about once per year. Pick any of your big name corporations, across any sector (e.g. Healthcare, Technology, Accounting, Space Exploration, etc.) and you'll see that layoffs are a normal operating process (with some layoffs being larger than others). The reason why this is important to understand is so that you can understand that a layoff is not "the end", nor does it signify that a company is about to go bankrupt. Objectives change, goals change, and funding sources may also change. Pivoting is necessary in some cases, for the betterment of the company and all of its constituents (us, the players). 
---
Companies have ambitious goals. For publicly traded companies, many of the goals are recounted during quarterly shareholder meetings. Some of these goals are purely motivated by the street, while other goals are motivated by an executive leader who has a vision and can inspire staff to achieve new things.
---
When the goals aren't met, things need to change. We will never know what the roadmap was at Arenanet. What we do know is that they are restructuring to save costs and appear to be winding down projects which were not ready for prime time. Arenanet intended to release a couple of projects, and in building out the teams for those projects, they cannibalized the GuildWars 2 team. By moving their veteran talent on to new projects, they hoped to follow in a path of success and create other games which are successful.  
---
At some point, an executive leader decided to pull the plug (this is typically due to cost overruns and time-to-market). The result has been the fall out that we're seeing across these forums. 
---
I think this is really cool and it was something I wanted to do years ago myself, but I don't like that it's posted to reddit because that's normally the only place where when things get exposure actually get nerfed. Thankfully though I think it might be okay this time because there's such a shitshow going on at the studio that I don't think they will care about arah exploiting.
---
Good stuff dudes!
---
 I tend to play on and off, not that I don't like the game but sometimes it  \*Feels\* like there's not allot to do (or the things I want feel like a grind so I just get lazy),  but neverthe less  I have nearly 3k hours (2,834 hrs to be exact) put into this game,  and allot of memories like the first time a close friend showed me a review of the game when it came out, and gifted it to me for my birthday,  joining my first raid guild, the POF viewing party,   and so many other moments  inbtween,   many of which i'll likely never forget,  Thank you Anet for nearly 3k hours of adventure in Tryia\~
---
4k hours and no regrets
---
So not purposefully withholding to just before patch so no one else can beat it like some other records have done XD. 
---
Yeah, I think there's good proof in the history for people to be worried over, but it also should remain worry.
---
I think the best thing we can do is continue to *play* as if nothing had changed, until there's clear proof or announcements that it is changing, or will change. And at that point visibly and with finality stop being involved.
---
As weak as the "speak with your wallet" argument often is, unfortunately it is a sign that even companies like NCSoft track, and we can only hope they eventually come to respect it.
---
It's been a good run folks. Kind of disappointed that I just bought the xpacs but what can you do
---
Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of steak and asparagus and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of steak and asparagus out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results today. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is GW2 dying? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe NCSoft is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Colin to come back and fix this broken company. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought gw2 earnings were doing well this quarter???? This is so fucked.
---
Lena Raine is no longer a freelancer at Anets. 
---
|I really want to share with your optimism, that the game will be fully focused and we will be getting more content than a 2 hour story map every 4 months, but the merging with NCsoft really don't bode good news...what if they push more p2w like their other MMO? Or a sub?
---
I mean that event is a world boss and intended to be played by dozens of players.
---
If you're going around calling people Nazis because you got banned, you probably deserved to get banned in the first place. People who comply with the rules aren't the people going around calling mods nazis
---
my point
---
Enron had quite a few workers too. It's a dead game because of the content releases not the money they make, the money they spend, or their numbers of employees. 
---
How do I give a giant middle finger to NCSoft but also show love **and** support for ArenaNet...
---
 Lena Raine is no longer a freelancer at Anets. Left Anet permanently.
---
Just make gw3, start over do it right, and give me alot of gems for my hard work in gw2 for the new game, problem solved 
---
What happened to "Core GW1 and GW2 teams will be unaffected?" My ass they were unaffected.
---
Well that isn't looking good for the already bleak future of raids
---
This is what NCSoft does.
---
It's gonna be a rough week.
---
Yep, the worst thing anyone could do right now is decide the game isn't worth spending money on anymore. I bought myself a character slot this weekend.
---
As a manager who has to do more layoffs than I'd like to...HR will often suggest higher paid/longer termed employees to let go first.  I've had more than a few arguments with them that those are the *least* smart people to let go. 
---
I'd rather let go the new employee than have 15 years of knowledge walk out my door. 
---
&lt;3 
---
If you have the details still have you tried putting in a ticket to recover it?
---
What are these rumors? Please say more 😥
---
&gt; Let people volunteer for lay-offs?
---
That's actually incredibly common and honestly kind of a decent thing: it's lets people walk away on their own terms with a severance package and a good reference. Imagine that you were considering leaving the company anyways, then this was announced and someone else who wanted to stay lost their job while you kept your's -- everyone loses in that situation.
---
Ultimately, I'd be shocked if Ben didn't have at least one really good job offer in his inbox by the end of the day when the layoffs were announced. He's very talented and probably will land somewhere quickly and for more money.
---
Heh, Ive been back for a month.  I just wasnt checking on recent news or anything and I didnt join the subreddit til last week.  The game seemed polished when I came back and the most recent big update to the living world was last month so it seemed like the game was ok.  No one was really chattering about it in game either.  
---
I haven't played for around a year and don't plan to until near the end of this year I would play if I could but personal life stopping me.
---
ANET didn't make a release schedule? Atleast they're consistent. 
---
A hundred people? Wow.
---
yeah and i'm not really wrong. what i mean the posts i'm saying they are hateful are like "good riddance you witch" etc etc. looks pretty hateful to me
---
Personally i just Demand a memorial in LA for all the loss of talent, lest we never forget them, i feel most appropriate would be a board held within [The Field of the Fallen](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Field_of_the_Fallen) with the Names of the losses. 
---
https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/230165307-Guild-Wars-2-Account-Types-Free-Core-HoT-PoF
---
You essentially get the core game (anything pre-expansion) with restrictions.  Although you can do all fractals and things generally involving vanilla maps.
---
We know you have a lot of questions about the future of Guild Wars 2. We want to share with you what to expect moving forward for the game. First and foremost, we are still fully committed to all of our players and ongoing support of the game. We will be moving directly from Living World Season 4 into Season 5 as promised, and we plan to continue a regular cadence of updates and releases.
---
so this was a lie i take it?
---
I know right? :^)
---
As far as we know, Susan is still chained to the desk.
---
ofc they did. anet just wasnt capable to deliver. thats it. thats why they got canceled. I am not saying ncsoft is the lone guilty party here, its def. anets fault too...
---
It's a downward spiral though. Cutbacks lead to a lack of manpower, which in turn leads to slower deliveries. Which leads to less sales. Which leads to less profit. Which leads to more cuts.
---
A merger makes me think we won't be getting an expansion.
---
Wow, Gaile Gray and the audio team :( 
---
I loved seeing Gaile during patch day where she'd hang out in DR talking to random people. I wonder what's going to happen with guild chat now that she's gone. 
---
The music/audio in the game is also top notch, the minute I walked into the new map and heard the choir it made me feel like that this was something special, something bigger than I'd imagine and made me excited to explore. Some of the stuff like the frog in VB and small details like Joko's staff made it feel like it really had an impact in the game. 
---
I used to be excited to see what'd happen 10 years from now, how many expansions we'd get and new elite specializations and raids/fractals. I was even optimistic when the layoffs happened because "they couldn't impact gw2". Now, I just don't know about the future of the game. 
---
If you *really* want to send a message to NCSoft, get online and buy a bunch of gems.
---
About 2.5k since beta, it's not much coated to smell but it's honest work 
---
Who is rubi?
---
I havnt actually, i just assumed that from gw2 perspective a gold seller would claim someone hacked their account and that they wouldnt be able to unban me but i guess it wouldnt hurt to try
---
Flashbacks to City of Heroes. This is what NCSoft does.
---
That's what I call overdramatic. Great performance.
---
If you gained 5 ranks a week (which is insanely low) for 1 year that's rank 260, barely above 100 after a year is pretty much NOT playing wvw at all. 
---
This could be a good thing for the game, actually. That is yet to be seen. What we mourn is the human factor of it. 
---
ESO
---
I'm surprised all the hate is not directed at the system. In other countries, you can't outright insta-fire an employee, let alone a quarter of your employees. I know that ANet's severance package is more attractive than most places, but there should be laws -- and there are, in some places -- against such things.
---
I am very sad for they ANet employees being laid off, I am sad for the ones who get to stay too, and I am sad in general for how people in the gaming industry are treated in the US.
---
Hope her the best but not too caught up on her leaving. All the communications (or lack thereof) I've seen from her are not impressive. Not cut out to be a community manager.
---
I don't know about Washington state law, but in California if more than 50 people are let go at one time, employees must be told 60 days in advance.  For most people, that means at least 60 days of paid time and they are allowed to leave.
---
I hope that's how things will hash out, but the reality is they were probably operating GW2 under the assumption those other projects were going to be released.
---
If one of them happened to be a game in the Guild Wars franchise (e.g. GW3, or even a more ambitious GW2 expansion), then this throws in a huge wrench if they're now forced to focus on GW2.
---
Spitballing about those two scenarios, in the case of GW3 this creates an awkward situation where season 5 was intended to be the end of GW2's story, but can't be any more. In the case of an ambitious expansion, it's probably more salvageable but if defunded it'll force them to reassess their direction of the game a couple years down the line.
---
They need to take the time to cope with this, but then they need to be more open with communication than ever.
---
I fear we're gonna have another City of Heroes on our hands.
---
I was preaching realism. Nothing over dramatic about being real.
---
&gt; People will want to know what the plan is. People will demand a road map to give them some semblance of reassurance that this game isn't going to be dead in a year's time. And frankly, I find it hard not to slip into that kind of panic myself.
---
It's not panic, it's reasonable request. If they expect us to keep funding their company it's important to provide a roadmap for what's to come after LW5.
---
The only person that people should really be worried about leaving is Mike O'Brien himself, if he leaves then the writing really is on the wall.
---
Yes. Why would it suddenly shutdown in light of these unfortunate events. If they had that much stopping power to the game, I wouldn’t be able to log on right now
---
"GW2 will not be affected!"
---
Ppl are acting like someone died....
---
This industry kills everything I love, our day is over people. If your not 14 with lightning quick reflexes or are a premature gambling addict....the gaming is dead.
---
sure :)
---
100+ people just lost their jobs because of profits that were coming in before any of this was ever announced but yes keep sending ANET &amp; NCSOFT your paychecks it will surely help the game. This is stupid. 
---
games are in the same spot these days as music was a decade+ ago. you just have to search for the good ones more, because the market gets flooded with shit.
---
gaming is def. not dead.
---
This is the one I was worried about the most tbh... His interaction with the community and dedication to the game was the last thing that kept me playing. I don't know how big of an impact he personally made with the fractals but it's one of the best content I've ever played in an MMO and I think it wouldn't be the same without him. Well... won't be the same. ;(
---
I don't see this really going anywhere. But the notion that "I love GW2, and i love ANet" has to mean that all the developers are amazingly talented individuals is just crazy. 
---
Every business has some amazing employees, some good ones, some serviceable ones and some shitty ones. ANet is no different, and a lot of the people let go will fall into the latter two categories based on how the game has gone the last couple of years. 
---
Yes it's sad, yes it's an awful snapshot of what the games industry is now, yes this will be an awful time of upheaval and rebuilding for those left at the company, but these things do not make everyone let go some kind of game developer prodigy. 
---
At this point if they only work on living story that may as well be maintenance mode. The playerbase will slowly die off with no major features or content drops to bring people back or new players in
---
Almost 3,700 hours. I've played since launch day of GW2 with my boyfriend who introduced me to the game. I've met some of the devs who are leaving, and while they may not remember me I will always remember them and how kindly they treated their fans.
---
Fair Point. I haven't accumulated that much gold, myself. 
---
Not precily no. But what you see is happening and the info about the unknown projects, it is a strong hypothesis that Anet fucked up, which cost too much money for NCSoft, which put an end to the side projects steering them back to the main game.
---
/depression 
---
And the Oscar for Best Engrish Hyperbole goes to...
---
Wasnt she supposed to be part of a story step in HoT that got scrapped... like 50% of all other HoT story
---
Seriously, you could rehabilitate a city of paraplegics with the number of knee-jerks I've seen here. This is day 1. Do not pretend that the people laid off today were the only talented people at ANet, or that they were all working on GW2. People aren't lying when they say that they work with amazing, talented people. Make decisions about whether to support the game based on the content that comes out in 6-8 months (i.e. the content that will be at least partly worked on by the new people), not on day one.
---
My only real complaint with it is the random mining village in the northwest. The ruins were kinda cool, though I wish they'd space it out a bit more and just made a proper GW2 town.
---
Never knew that was a thing
---
They already made a statement and their studio is closed today and tomorrow. 
---
Give it *at least* a week to recoup and figure out where the game goes next. 
---
considering evan's gone now, probably yeah
---
It may have been NCSoft or then it was an internal decission that backfired. We don't know.
---
Thank you for helping to create and shape my favorite content in Guild Wars, Ben. I still feel really lucky that I got to tell you that in-game, after running Caudecus's Manor with you once.
---
Wherever you end up next is getting a very talented and thoughtful developer.
---
That's just an effortless meme shitpost though. Nothing of value was lost
---
Company is closed for two days, and besides it'll just be "all is well, lots of stuff planned".
---
Can you give me any source on the WoW subscriber numbers?
---
Senior devs got prob a lot of money to flee away so they can hire more new devs with same money and focus more on the game, and don't say the new devs will be less talented, they'll be paid less just coz they'll be new but they can have the same talent or even bigger you never know
---
well i can't point you to the posts i'm referring cause mods already deleted them.  
---
True, communication managers are like the first to go. They want to focus on replacing these roles with people that actually create content.
---
No I’d say it is definitely behind ESO now, which is still getting expansions.
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
Sorry to be this salty but i really cant wrap my head around the fact that they could not get this message out sooner.
---
Oh, damn. This isn't good news. She'll be missed.
---
Sadly im in the same boat....
---
It wasnt any part of the managment, as far as we know, that got the axe. Instead several well known and (though not universally) liked faces - I'm sure the "younger/cheaper" staff that fills the gaps is talented as well and fills the respective role with at least as much passion as the seniors. But in terms of standing in the community they will have to catch up at first.
---
I wish I could have that kind of confidence. All of this has just been a sucker punch to me.
---
If the remaining devs and the focus from the other projects that were cancelled get put back into GW2 then this game can certainly maintain itself. It's understandable that the next few updates will get affected with this as the entire company got shaken up by this I'm sure. 
---
But I'm sure a lot of people will be watching the next releases closely (as I will be as well). Hopefully GW2 will live for a few more years. Just give us a good ending to the Elder Dragon saga. That's all I really want at this point.
---
&gt; I don't see this really going anywhere. But the notion that "I love GW2, and i love ANet" has to mean that all the developers are amazingly talented individuals is just crazy.
---
Oh, I agree. Most people are, in fact, average.
---
The thing is, though, a perfectly average developer is worth his salary. Thousands of perfectly average businesses manage to profitably employ millions of perfectly average developers.
---
Most of those developers have zero-to-none say in how the business actually runs.
---
&gt; ANet is no different, and a lot of the people let go will fall into the latter two categories based on how the game has gone the last couple of years.
---
"The business plan failed, therefore, obviously, some of the line workers we employed were shit" is post-facto justification.
---
Im sorry but supporting gw2 is one thing but supporting company that lay off major ppl who actually made game is other. 
---
I wouldnt expect a statement by the end of the week at least - if not the next one... things must be chaotic in there and very grim
---
i got a linkedin ad while browsing gw2 subreddit
---
Free speech means you can say whatever you want without government persecution. It does not mean you get to say whatever you want without consequences.
---
In terms of accepting criticism, there's a difference between "yeah that dev was shit and everyone is happy they're gone. Good riddance! " and "I don't think they were suitable for the role and they were not a good fit to the team." Exact same meaning but one is hateful.
---
You should be mad.  Ncsoft destroyed blade and soul and now are working on guild wars.  2 of the most fun mmos i have played.  They promised no loot box mechanic and went back on it before the end of the first month. Starting the pay to win right away in bns.    I would not be surprised to start seeing that in gw2 now that they are digging their greedy claws into anet.  
---
It does not matter what they release, i will not give another cent to ncsoft.  Greed always wins out for them. Also applies to EA, activision and so many others now.
---
My condolences man. Wish you luck finding a new job.
---
Giving the devs space is a must but the head of Anet should've made a in-depth response by now. I know they love to stay quiet but now is not the time for that. They need to tell us exactly why this happened and what the future(if there is one) holds.
---
**/Salute**
---
Good riddance, most of the current team in their departments does garbage unsustainable work for a game with this much potential.
---
Get lost Gaile, nobody will miss your mundane and tasteless reddit mom fluff post replies and mass censoring on your forums.
---
Enjoy your ban
---
Expecting this today? wow you are dense
---
I guess you can assume that? I guess you could also assume that someone found you pleasant enough to want to add you to their list. There's nothing really detrimental to it, unless you just want to be unnoticed. 
---
Very true. The only thing that gives me hope is that GW2 is still very profitable and on almost every best MMO chart. That and NCSoft killed off the other projects ANet was working on leaving just GW2. I'm not kidding myself and I know that the end is near may very well be a reality but I'm hoping that based on everything we know that won't be the case. But I also don't expect GW2 to be the same. 
---
Spend your money on things you like (i.e. Guild Wars 2 if you feel the content is something you enjoy), don't focus on not spending money on things you hate. You'll inevitably fail. Just ask yourself before every purchase "is this something I want to see more of?"
---
Or, in a simpler way, "Does this content spark joy?"
---
Hmm... catchy... I should write a book.
---
I'll decide if the game's still worth my money when it proves it with release schedules going back to stable and regular, and communication.. Being a thing again. Not when I'm kept in the dark and left to assume the worst. Simple as that.
---
They probably are right now. I'm just trying to do the best that I can to keep the sub clean and focus on the current situation.
---
I completely understand your anger but gaming isn't dead and the post is just not a valuable post at the current time.  
---
Nothing of value lost with this one. 
---
that was harsh. i know your just doing your job. Chin up, stay true to the devs
---
Yeah 10 veterans leaving might let 15 juniors stay. As much as it hurts to leave its probably gonna be hard to stay with so many long time friends ripped away too, so maybe you just make a clean break now. I can't even imagine walking away from a job after that many years, must be really painful.
---
So when Guild Wars 2 is losing money, we can talk about whether or not it's like City of Heroes. Anet was involved in other projects that didn't pan out.  The only real money coming into Anet at all is Guild Wars 2. It's also NcSofts only game that's making real money in the West. I seriously doubt it's in any jeopardy. But obviously if they can't bring out any other product in 7 years there are issues somewhere.
---
The point is, even if City of Heroes did close for no reason, we have a data set of 1.  It's hardly conclusive. 
---
Even if that was true, he did what he thought was best for him. Nothing wrong with that. Whether it was salary based or so younger talent can develop or both.
---
Regardless though, please keep in mind he's communicated to us on Reddit, he's talked to us on anet videos, so we (well some of us I guess) are attached to him, same as with Gaile gray. He's tried very hard to make the game better for us. I never even remember him passing some Reddit feedback to different teams! I noticed how with the new instabs he had listened to some of the community. He's probably changing some instabs due to community feedback next balance patch.
---
This is not a good day for the community.
---
:|
---
Its before the patch day so I don't see how it makes an difference. Its entirely understandable given what they are going through.
---
I'm going to hop on the treadmill and do my daily workout.  
---
It's a new habit that I've started recently.  Beyond that, I'm still incredibly thankful for my guild leaders, Karaoke &amp; Rice, for letting me join their communities and re-discover what it meant to have *good* friends.  I've come so much further as a person and am much less frustrated than I was years ago as Fury or Lyssa.  GW2 gave me hope where, for a long time, there was just *nothingness.*
---
I'll continue investing time into GW1.  I've got a date with a promising new friend within a few weeks.  I'm trying not to get too sentimental, but GW2 provided me an escape and also a means to learn how to communicate and socialize with people.  I'm on the spectrum -- *that* spectrum -- and I had a lot of bad habits that I had to break and learn how to effectively relate to people.  
---
GW2? I'll continue playing, but not nearly as often.  It's been fun, and I've surpassed most of my goals by leaps and bounds.  I'm still interested in how the story will resolve itself, or if we'll get a 3rd expansion, but I won't sugar-coat it.  I'm not really all that interested in the living story; I don't think LS4 has really risen to expectations.  What  do feel I owe ArenaNet?
---
I think that we owe them a continued enjoyment of gaming; GW2 or otherwise.  I think that gaming as both a social activity, a means to meet new people and get involved with new communities isn't necessarily just a hobby, but a lifestyle.  Gaming is bigger than just GW2 and I think we owe it to ArenaNet to have happy, sad, funny, exciting or frustrating moments both inside GW2, outside of GW2 and out in the real world.  We owe good memories and a fond, heartfelt farewell to those leaving or moving on from the company. 
---
name calling is bad, death wishes or other vile wishes are bad, but evaluating a work of people managing the product we all paid for is okay in my book, even when some may say someone deserved to be laid off
---
Crazy about Gaile, she has been with them forever and really helped build up the community.
---
Pretty much this. I don't have any problem supporting the game but enough silence.
---
If you think it's hate speech to say someone deserved to be fired than good luck in life.
---
Wow.  I saw her in-game just last Wintersday in DR and we exchanged greetings.  Sad to see her go after such a long association with the franchise.
---
Really beginning to wish Anet had brought themselves off from NCSoft, as was rumoured likely a couple years back.
---
[I do not want to be in Mike O'Briens shoes right now](https://www.mmorpg.com/guild-wars-2/news/arenanets-offices-closed-as-layoffs-begin-ahead-of-restructuring-1000051606)
---
He is a man who is shaken to his foundation right now
---
You're hearing one side of the story.  You don't know these people regardless of whether you follow their channel or not.
---
Did you forget that blizzard have other active titles?
---
Given the circumstances this is understandable I'm glad they gave us advance notice.
---
You mean one living season episode every 3-4 months with maybe one new end game raid content per year wasn't enough? Or the virtually non existent PvP/WvW updates? PoF was really bland and lacked content, but mounts were great and it looked pretty! Broken METAs in PoF that people are unable to finish because no one runs them and no update by Anet to change how they scale. No tutorial for core game concepts like CC and break bars? Yeah, that's not Anet's fault... /s. 
---
I agree, Anet has a LOT of blame on them, I completely agree. I haven't bought any gems since PoF release mainly because of these reasons. I still love the game and gameplay, but this game gets so little attention it sucks. I just hope it doesn't turn into pay2win. 
---
It's how **publicly owned** corporations work. I've worked in companies that went from private to public. It's when the company becomes majority owned by investors seeking profits that destroys the original vision of the company. They go from the passion of making games to the passion of making money.
---
Do you know what other projects they were involved with?
---
Fuck NCSoft
---
Fuck all of them.
---
Am I correct to assume that this is the entire patch being delayed, or just the Warclaw release?
---
She was just a fluff person so it makes sense to yeet her, but man today has been a shitshow, I guess Anet and gw2 are done for :o 
---
Considering so many of the people let go were the sorts of people who made GW2 what it is, the prospects look quite bleak. 
---
But as it turned out, buying gems did not support gw2, but those other cancelled projects.
---
The only reasonable thing is to wait until official announcement and a roadmap is presented. There is no reason to fund the game that we don't know the future for our investment.
---
It's not going to be GW3. If anything it's going to be Cantha expansion, which the story has been alluding to for quite some time.
---
So glad I haven't even logged into the game in months, if this is the prevailing attitude.  Lemme know how great that challenging aspect is when the game is bleeding players and on its last legs.
---
this is true. its not dead. but it sure feels dead right now, for me.  I understand and thank your for your work even if it is to shelter a deranged fan from their own toxic post.
---
Like I said elsewhere so much for no GW2 staff being let go as some people were clinging to.
---
ahahahaha
---
And why is another criticism post(not my) about also remove, do you see any criticism on frontpage?
---
Nothing wrong with that comment. 
---
I have noticed that she has gotten more grumpy over the years. For her, I imagine it does hit hard to leave a game and company she has been with for almost 20 years.
---
I'm just stunned. We're losing so many beloved people. ;-;
---
[PINK] is portaling salutes for you Josh.
---
Been there. Done that. This is business.  It's tragic, but performance is factored into these things. As someone who had to do the same decisions Mike Obrien had to recently....
---
That said, no ill will to anyone leaving the company.  It sucks to bet let go.  
---
I mean you can probably get unemployment, but a lot of times you can get fired with cause for no reason because of at will employment and then they just deny your UE case and you don't get shit.
---
Blizzard only has like 8 other major titles
---
last i checked, d912pxy does not work on linux.

---
/salute Thank you for all you've done
---
4973 hours, 90% of which were Mesmer. Love that class so much. 
---
I'm sorry? This is a growing trend in the gaming industry, blizzard, telltale games, anet, Activision, this cannot be allowed to stand
---
I mean if you don't have the decency to care that people lost their jobs, I don't have anything to say to you.
---
This one hurts the most.
---
LOL at all these tips on how to cope with this
---
Yea, my whole guild quit too for the same reason. Fractals/raids RIP. 
---
I might agree with you except for the times that Anet removed stuff from the game because it was "too hard" or "too confusing" to new players.
---
I don’t play GW2 all that much anymore but Gaile is a shocker. I remember her posts on gwguru “back in the day”. Gaile’s was a name we all knew in GW1. This is awfully saddening. 
---
I know about one of them. I've had devs in my guild over the years. I don't know detail.  One of those devs hasn't worked for Anet in quite a while now, but she was in my guild and years ago she was taken off Guild Wars 2 to work on a mobile game.  So some of these devs are definitely working on mobile games. We also know they hired some people with expertise in that field. That's the only project I know about for sure.  Obviously I don't want to name the devs because it would be a violation of her privacy and confidence.
---
Big fat zero.
---
This, this right here is what worries me the most right now. And this is why they shouldn't delay updates, especially in times like this.
---
R.I.P. GW2 2012 - 2019? Too soon?
---
Given who is leaving many GW2 modes will be hugely affected.
---
[](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbNtvKrMWjQ)
---
please release 2nd gen legendary greatsword b4 game sinks
---
man we literally have some death wishes here and other vile stuff. if that's not hate for you then i don't know.  anyway good day to you.
---
Couldn't this only mean Josh wasn't working on Guild Wars anymore? When was the last time we had a jumping puzzle?
---
I know it's looking grim people but as far as we "know" people were pulled to other projects while making it seem the company and it' employees had it's focus on GW2.
---
The really, really need to make a statement as soon as they are humanly able. I know it is hard but this shit is killing the community spirit of the game that's keeping them afloat at all.
---
Congrats man, most people who have made that claim go on to say they "pug" with just a friend or two in voice chat but I can tell you're legit. 
---
Perhaps you'll make a YouTube video of lighting all of those fires in Chaos by yourself as you'll be the only one left playing this dead game. 
---
* GW1: 5257k 
---
* GW2: 4936k 
---
Just my main accounts.
---
"I volunteered?" What did they do? Make them choose themselves who gets fired? Is this some kind of sick game?
---
I get you are making a joke post, but you picked the wrong time for that.
---
I had a commander today blasting smoke fields... That's something I gues
---
they were probably making a mobile game like those retards at blizard did
---
/salute o7
---
support what? another game u wont be playing? the money didnt go into this game, same old crap UI, Game Engine, slow Amazon server, WvW neglect etc.  Dont worry u will finish ur legendary ring after 10 years.  People got layoff are actually the one who knows how to program, now its official GW2 is on Maintenance Mode.
---
Man Gaile has been with them so long.  I don't doubt that hurts.
---
Good luck in your future Gaile! &lt;3
---
They'll get continued support when they can produce. Repeatedly hyping and cancelling patches shows they aren't able to function as a company. layoffs happen, letting them cripple the remaining staff is unacceptable
---
This sounds amazing
---
&gt; The fights are something like 25 v 25, with each side having 50 cheerleaders. The comm might empower and go left when they get engaged on, but at best 25 players move. The other 50 have a ping of 5000 ms. 
---
&gt; There is no strategy in the fight itself, no matter how good the intentions of your cheerleaders are. 
---
Feels bad because that's normal WvW not even on patch welp. 
---
Kinda miffed at the Balthazar turn, still.
---
God of honor, my ass.
---
Officially they have just said the release is delayed but I think it is safe to say that any patch tomorrow is delayed as the patch would of included the Warclaw. Plus the offices will be closed and as far as I know they have never released a patch the day they are closed.
---
I doubt that anyone is going to really want to do much work this week considering so most likely there will be nothing tomorrow and I assume we'll get a statement or few sometime at the end of the week and the next week we'll be back to 'normal' whatever the new normal is.
---
top 3? Afaik there are 4 major MMOS... GW2 WoW ESO and FFXIV
---
Fire people with seniority/XP and replace them with cheaper juniors= profit. Also, disgusting.
---
oh my god.

&gt;Value
---
4,764h 28m  
---

---
there is a reason we are still playing *this* game and not others...through thick and thin, bad or good updates, its still the best
---
Thank you. &lt;333 Wish I hadn't had to write it, but I couldn't see folks go without saying it.
---
He thankfully is safe. 
---
You think devs there work on every title they have?  They have different divisions for the different games.
---
It all just came rushing back, and I wanted to cry. I still miss my characters and my supergroup.
---
RIP, The Wonders. You were the best small supergroup I ever had. I miss you.
---
There was a guy last week who posted in Reddit saying he can't wait for the balance patch and was so excited n
---
Rip dude... Rip
---
The sad thing is though,
---
1) SAB hasn't had updates \*forever\*.  It's a meme at this point that we'd expect the same SAB content as the past few years.
---
2) Gaile Gray posted on the GW2 forums \*maybe\* once a week at most, sometimes going for weeks at a time.
---
3) The API team hasn't updated the API for literally almost a year now, if not longer.  The API has all sorts of issues that they've never corrected since new patches came out.  Check out the official forums, it's been a mess for eons now.
---
So yeah, I think at least those 3 items those people were definitely not 100% on GW2.  I think they were positioned elsewhere on those unannounced projects.
---
y i k e s
---
Just wanted to say, I completely support this post, Mod. Good on you.
---
Honestly, it's just people whom we loved because of their part in creating this game. Game was dead for quite a while now, lets be honest. PvP never balanced, WvW became a joke and only PvE...the easiest content in any gaming company was somehow alive. Nothing new was created, just some new skins to squeeze your RNG pocket. There is always a reason why profits fall. Those who remained in the company will start thinking how to improve gaming content. Honestly, I thought this step had to be taken at least a year ago...just knowing NcSoft I hope it won't become just another p2w project... Crazy, I have been playing NcSoft games for more than 15 years... I see brighter future for this game now.
---
without roadmap it is safeto assume nothing is coming after lw5 therefore no money should be invested into gw2 anymore by players
---
Welp, I gues windows gets to live anothe day
---
**Bolding** your opinions doesn't make them facts.
---
&gt;I only see NCSoft wanting to STRENGHTEN this game with their moves 
---
I cannot even fathom the mental gymnastics you had to perform to come up with that whopper of a line.  You don't layoff over 25% of the company, including some of the top veterans, to strengthen a game.
---
lol yep my current manager wants me to help them with an investment project using a new tech stack but told me I can't bill the hours for reading up books on the tech stack / doing research. I'm supposed to do that on my own free time. I politely declined.
---
GW2 is fuckeddddd
---
"GW2's services" can literally just mean the game is still running, that's basically it.
---
That's fine, when have you given a shit at your local tire center, or hardware store, or McDonalds or anything?
---
Or are you just a virtue warrior when its convenient?
---
fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
---
I would say the game is in a better place, but it is a little subjective. I can't summarize everything that's happened in the last 2 years (maybe there's a link in the sidebar that can), but we've had quite a few QoL updates, including:
---
- right click &gt; consume all on bags, luck, and other things
---
- a bunch of keys and map currencies have been added to the wallet
---
- a bunch of things have been added to material storage
---
Fractals have changed a bit. There are a few new fractals, instabilities are different every day, and instabilities were recently revamped. This has seen a mixed response from players, but personally I like the new instabilities.
---
I don't know about flair, but it might be worth pointing out that boon chrono has been punched in the face repeatedly by balance patches. Check your build on Discretize or Snow Crows before walking into group content unprepared.
---
Yeah that's why I said NCSoft: this is on them, Arenanet is on the chopping block :/
---
The friends list is for the player's convenience, not the people they add to the list. It is precisely what it states, a list of people. Why should you get notified when you get added to a list? Don't you worry about which list I just added you to, alright? 
---
Wow this fucking sucks.
---
Not even a case of her being cut because she's a vet. If NCsoft are taking more control over the anet and cutting staff then marketing, support, and community roles are top of the list because they can cover those with their in house team they have direct control over.
---
 **Thank you for the emotions that you gave me through the game. Thanks you. With hope for the future, with faith in the best.** 
---
yep and companies like amazon and many others who do stack ranking does this too if they don't deem you worthy / talented enough to be paid enough to stay.
---
Community complaints+high salary+not bringing anything to the table for development=gg gaile
---
megathreads tend to diminish conversation. I think it's fine to appreciate everyone whos leaving and give them their time. What other stuff do we discuss while we wait for the Warclaw? This flood of posts will only last so long.
---
They went into chop mode but they aren't even attempting to salvage tried and true veterans from other projects. I mean, some of them are probably leaving over their new projects being cut from under them but even then this just sucks. Was NCSoft footing the bill for all these other projects or is ANet responsible for some of this? I guess if it was this or lose you're publisher Anet would have no choice... 
---
I'm not a manager of anyone, but the mindset you mentioned boggles my mind. What kind of argument does HR give to support their suggestion?
---
The 300 people left at A.Net are not all devs. Most of them aren't, in fact.
---
There's customer service, dev-ops folks, community reps, HR, and so on, and so on.
---
All of those roles exist at Blizzard - but they aren't solely working on WoW - and are not part of the 'WoW dev team.'
---
Keep being in denial. You are not convincing many people.
---
City of Heroes, Wildstar and now this... My love and respect for GW2 and Anet far outweigh my disdain for NCSoft, so yeah supporting the game is the way to go for me.
---
Not too hard if you find a nice GM to "Carry" :P  
---
Also for those who doesn't know yet, there's another **GM Hidden for doing a Fractal** (also added at the same time that the raid one), you can check it on GW2Efficiency Hidden AP's over Community category.
---
First off, I think there are a ton of things to sink your teeth into. Look up the Games You Might Not Have Tried series from the Extra Credits people. There are more games out there than ever and they're almost all fun, interesting, unique, or some combination. It's one of the things that's astounded me about people's constant braying about lack of content in GW2. It's like people ignore or don't see 80% of what's out there because they're too into their tunnel-vision.
---
Secondly, I think time will show that the future's brighter. We don't just have "interns". ANet laid off \~100 people from their staff of 400. It's substantial, but they don't have 100 "real" employees and 300 interns.
---
Third, as someone who only watched the cutscene "movies" of KH3 and had a good few weeks of existential despair "oh my God, Disney fucking owns everything and look what they did the the Frozen section of KH3 and everything is disingenuous and made to sell toys and oh my god Disney fucking owns every-" -- keep rewarding the things that you enjoy, and consider making the things you like, even as just a hobby. One of the things that has helped my general mental health is doing personal creative writing, and GW2's world has been a great inspiration.
---
&gt;Do t4 teach me anything about Samarog, Xera, or Vale Guardian and how they work
---
When you have played your class to that point in T4s, those are all a joke, especially Samarog. Literally killed him with 1 hand before. There are obviously transferable skills from playing your class, from rotation to general survivability. Sure you need to know the different mechanics, but that's it, and it's really not that hard.
---
&gt;Then you are lying that you had a massive skill gap because T3 was way harder than T4 if you were there to remember Necro meta and the plague of Last Laugh.  
---
It's more that T3s have lower hp than T4s meaning if you are doing your rotation right you burn through it regardless. Honestly, if you can speed run T3s you shouldn't have too much of a problem in T4s though. 
---
I’m pretty sure it’s just the publishing division they said was merging
---
Here's the problem.
---
This was always going to happen eventually. Mobile games make **WAY** more money than "normal" games like MMOs ever will, and GW2 never achieved the WoW numbers that NCSoft wanted to begin with. It is simply not in NCSoft's business interests to pump resources into low margin games indefinitely. As a large international corporation, their overarching strategy for games is to develop them, ride the hype and marketing trains until the slope on the profit chart starts to trend downward, and then use cost cutting tactics like restructuring to minimize the dropoff over time until sometime down the line the games can go into maintenance mode. We are fortunate that GW2 is making a profit at all or they would take more drastic measures like shutting it down.
---
It happened to City of Heroes (I'm still not over that one) and others. It will continue to happen.
---
Hi Gaile! I'm just another rando Gw1/2 player, who was aware/enjoyed of your presence in the GW2 community (apologies, the link didn't state the reasons for your departure), but wanted to step fourth and thank you for being a part of it! I wish you the very best in whatever you go on to do! :)
---
I mean, it's pretty easy to become jaded when everything you know the players want is never actually on the table, or even the floor next to the table....or even the same room.
---
Maybe leaving is the best thing for her. I've been in a job I was unhappy with but stayed for various reasons. Being laid off was the best thing to happen to me in that scenario.
---
voluntary redundancy with incentives is a pretty common occurrence in any industry.
---
mate by that standard flappy bird isn't a dead game, get real
---
I'll support it when they finally improve on an aspect that interests me. After playing for 3500 hours, I haven't launched this game since 2015.
---
GW1 remains operational despite having no actual staff.

&gt;I was told the requirements , and I found them believable , but don't have a source , so take with a grain of salt please :

WVW level 1200 , 100 gold , 250 ability points. The wvw level is the only real barrier to casual acquisition
---
From his/her comment history. That comment is at 0 points - totally downvoted to hell.
---
Nono the star wars subreddit. 
---
But they had the knowledge and vision to get back at it again and continue their work **if** they were repositioned on those tasks. Now they're gone :(
---
Guess it's safe to say it now:  
---
A PS4 and Xbox port should've happened ages ago. FF14 can run fine on PS4 there's always talk brewing of a Switch port if Sony greenlights crossplay. NCSoft and Arenanet really shot themselves in the foot by not porting to PS4. 
---
yeah a shame it doesn't favor group play as much as it should be
---
little do the players know, guild wars 2 was the side project.
---
 :O Benjamin Arnold, really?  ... we are doomed...and the other veterans!?!... So many talented people fired. Insane. I am not sure how GW2 will recover.
---
Well I wasn't really talking elitist. I just don't think it's that difficult to get some gear. Then again that's just my personal experience.
---
See, that's super common and actually a best case scenario. As bad as it is, these people are proven vets. They're going to find work work much easier than someone whose only been doing this sort of thing for a few years. This is quite frankly, the best thing they could have done.
---
&gt; the company cares enough about their (remaining) employees' mental health that they're giving people some room.
---
howls of derisive laughter, bruce
---
Not effect it as in we are still going to get planned releases. Not not effect it as in things will go on as if nothing is happening. Anet is closed today and tomorrow 
---
have my upvote, and a smile
---
Who's the lead game designer?

Balthazar was more about glory. Kormir kind of got over the honor part.

Thanks for the callout, I appreciate the support. As of today, I'm no longer with the studio, though my departure was voluntary. My time at the studio is something I'll always treasure. Best of luck to the remaining dev team, and fans alike.

All the best! I always had the impression that fractals were of a much higher quality since you put your focus on them. Thank you for all the nice hours and let us know where you end up! Those games will be worth checking out for sure!
