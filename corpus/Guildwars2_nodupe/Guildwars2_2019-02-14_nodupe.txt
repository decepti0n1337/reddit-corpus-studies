Hahaha. I spent most of my WoW gold on transmog. I need to be beautiful in game. :D I am a dude tho, yeah!
---
---
---
I love seeing research like this!
---

---
I'd like to see max run speeds for each profession, too, but that would take more research to find what the optimal running rotation is. I know the actual out-of-combat run speed cap is 33% faster, but I wonder how much teleports (like blink/jaunt) can make you 'run faster' (average speed rather than instantaneous) than that, and what the actual max average speed is for each profession (over a long period of time). 
---
it-shirt funny how they invented the deepest most intricate most revolutionizing most enjoyable skill system in gaming history.
---
and then completely abandon every trace of it. even the small quality of life improvement that could be employed to the new and current shadow of its iteration. such as templates.
---
I would love some of the GW1 Codes, I never played it and would like to try GW1 a bit. Thank you for the giveaway :) 
---
I mean if someone is not responding for that long most would assume either AFK or DC.
---
Looks like the legs are crossed
---
Seems to be limiting themselves in terms of designing it
---
(Noob talking)
---
IMO Revenant was a bad pick in that regard. I think anything but Mesmer and Elementalist (and Revenant) is a decent pick. And maybe avoid Thief.
---
I'm currently maining a Sentinel's/Soldier's (But may switch to Marauder) (tl;dr Power) Reaper with a focus on Shroud. So far it melts everything and it has a pretty 'easy' rotation without feeling too mindless. And you can still have all your skills on minions if you want, or put them on life-force generating skills for more Shroud popping.
---
Well I’ve been using the griffin all wrong 
---
Guild Wars 2: Heroic Edition would be great!
---
Thanks so much for the chance!
---
IKR? It was ridiculous amounts of load times and I don't blame them, but it's nice in XIV to be able to let people know "oh sorry, I'm just loading in, I'll be there shortly!"
---
I only have the load issues with GW2 as well....
---
Gems. You can change worlds by paying gems
---
Could've gone with that as well. Or Vinewrath, or basically any meta. Always some people in mapchat complaining/blaming/doing anything but actually contributing in open world.
---
I wish the carnival in divinities reach would open. 
---
):
---
The only things I want in GW2 are Rare Spawns and Fishing. I'v eplayed MMOs for a long time and a lot of enjoyment I get is from chasing rare spawns. The other would be fishing. Its very easy to add a engaging and fleshed out fishing system that players could do in their spare/down time.

Heroic edition &lt;3
---
so i should eat sylvari?
---
got it
---
Would your guild talk shit on the pug and tell him to uninstall the game or just kick him?
---
The problem isn’t getting kicked, it’s the toxic atmosphere that guild that kicked him created. 
---
Unfortunately, not everyone perceives underperformance this way.
---
We are missing a couple key facts-&gt; 1. What was the LFG advertised for (how experienced, what they were looking for); 2. How did OP claim when he joined (if they were looking for experienced dps, did he say he was?); 3. How did OP respond if he was confronted about his dps in the first place? If he responded negatively, he would get a negative respond as such. Some people can be very negative to feedback. 
---
The common factor for cases like these lies with where people start out raiding. The community ( being good or being toxic) is always going to be a variable since you don't know what kind of group you're going into when you PUG.

You obviously didnt play while arcdps and bgdm had gear check. Those were the fun days.
---
Takes longer for me. Sad I know.
---
It's only efficient if you don't value your time.
---
To switch your Point of View a little:   
---
At first - I felt very similar to you. I felt I have to mash this and this button super quickly all the time in order to survive, I found the game super fast paced.  
---
Turns out, a shift in perspective -mentally- made a big difference for me. I was under a lot of adrenaline, was clenching my jaw in tricky situations, especially in PVP. I started to just focus on breathing and being calm and relaxed while playing, and all of a sudden everything seems much slower. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
\- not sure if this is applicable to you or anyone, but if I am calm in the head, I actually react much faster without it feeling like I am super fast, or rushed - does that make sense?
---
Also - if you like the Necro - there are a lot of different builds that you may like better, too! 
---
 Just leave out the minions. Its the same with Mesmer - if the clones do your work, it sometimes feels too easy
---
Scepter/torch + dagger Scourge with Epidemic is an epic PVE Build.  
---
There are power Reaper builds without minions, too.
---

"Everyone welcome Blizzard's new narrative designer, Jessica Price.  Thanks to Anet for recommending her!"

???? Black Powder for the smoke field not for damage or CC lmao wtf are you on
---
Firebrand also has quite an easy time upkeeping stuff like quickness, regen and might even without much boon duration (quickness barely needs any), so i'd consider grabbing some magis stuff to round out a minstrel set when you have enough boondur. FB healer scales really well with vitality because of the Honor trait that gives you outgoing healing based on vitality.
---
I run my fractals/raid healer firebrand with full magi and i can keep up perma quickness and fury, and together with a rev, (which fb is almost always paired with) also 25 might. And I heal INSANELY much running staff+axe/shield. (axe instead of mace for fury as in a fb/rev comp, you're the only fury source and feel my wrath isnt enough) 
---
Hellllllllllllnnnooooooooo I love that thing. Its stupid fun lol
---
Nah, just ready for something new. Every gameplay system and piece of content gets stale eventually.
---
I'd start playing regularly again if they stole battlegrounds from World of warcraft. 2v2, 3v3 queue supported game modes would be nice too
---
I'm not seeing any connection between the drawing of three charr and the drawing of pooh.
---
The MMO marketplace is not the same as it was seven years ago. It might be difficult for them to justify a sequel, even if they were ready to make it. 
---
I'd be happy to get Eye of the North DLC. Thanks a lot for doing this, you rock!
---
Just gotta practice
---
Living story does sometimes go on sale, I’m pretty sure I bought LS2 for a discount, I think during the anniversary time.
---
Well said.  Your right I don’t know how he responded to the original critique.  For all I know they did try and help OP and then OP caused a ruckus.  Idk I’ve seen this toxic attitude before for no reason so I’m giving the OP the benefit of the doubt.  Maybe I’m wrong maybe I’m right.  At the end of the day all you have to do is remove someone from a group.  No need for anything else. 
---
Pretty much the only sub 80 expansion content is the Revenant class. You can also technically enter expansion maps while you are sub 80, but without the relevant masteries (which require level 80) you will not have a fun time.
---
However buying an expansion is the way to remove the F2P restrictions, so there's that.
---
 👀

What /u/Help_Me_Im_Diene said, DLGamer usually has they best deal if there isn't a 50% sale going on (which would bring the official price down to $25 which is the lowest I've seen the combo for). [DLGamer is 38% off](https://dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-heart-of-thorns-path-of-fire-us-43911) the full ($60) price right now.
---
I, personally, disagree, but at this point it's just a matter of opinions.
---
GW1 - Mercenaries/Henchmen/Hero's. (I'm anxiaty ridden and have a hard time interacting with people. Zerg are generally fine as long as I don't have to speak up. But it scares me away from a lot of content, like dungeons.). Mercenaries should help with my feeling that when I play with an alt, the other alts don't feel wasting away.
---
Factorio - Craft the subcomponents of a thing, if you have everything for those subcomponents. e.i you can craft inserters from either iron+copper wire+green electronics or from iron plates and copper plates and it automatically crafts the intermediate products.
---
GTA 5 Online - A single currency for everything. Not that extreme, but I'd like most map currencies to be removed. or somehow to be interchangeble. I'm currently looking at getting some Bloodstone trickets. but from what I understand, I have to repeat the same 5 events and gather nodes for weeks on end with no variation. I'd love to just do anything and progress for whatever I fancy in that moment. Guild Wars 2 also feels like it does in a way, up untill HoT. In GTA it didn't matter if you were selling coke, weapons, cars or cargo. You could buy anything with it.
---
LotRO (Or I suppose Terraria) - Cosmetic Slots. I'm currently swapping a lot of armour around and have been wasting too many transmutation charges. Or just for asteatics and one day I like x but the next day I don't. But I feel like I have to transmute it because the mismatch (or over-lewdness) of skins hurts me. Dunno how Anet would feel about removing transmutation charges, though.
---
Obligatory ingame build templates.
---
I already forgot it was a thing. 
---
I always thought Dreamriders were mesmers but they might be hentaimentalists. 
---
umm lol
---
Why is it wrong to treat someone like crap if they first treat you like crap by wasting your time? I know it's not the noble thing to do, but I think you are fully within your right to do so if you want to.
---
I mean, I like the art style of WoW. Cartoonish, has its own charm. Not everything has to be Crysis.
---
It may not be your cup of tea but plenty of people like it.
---
What do you keep in your bank that needs quick access? I've got multiple tabs because I made the mistake of buying a lot early on, and almost all of them are full of things like consumable skin items or stacks of boosters. The only things that i benefit from having quick access to in there are my raid killproofs and a small selection of cross-character hoarding items like champ/raid bags. Could easily fit everything that needs to be in a BANK in a single bank slot.
---
Welcome back to the party, friend! Glad to have you :)
---
If you keep changing the variables and keep finding the same result then you might find that there is a constant factor which is responsible for this treatment. One of those constants could be you, did you ever consider it?
---
Heroic Edition would be amazing. Thank you!

## Guild Wars 2: Heroic Edition
---
Thank u for giveaway
---
Sure but people in Seattle with those skillsets would be aware to look at Anets job openings. As I said elsewhere Anet aren't creating new jobs they are just pointing they have existing vacancies.
---
So you never had a full minstrel druid in your group? Or youself never forget to swap some trinkets?
---
Or maybe age just affects different people differently.
---
There is an inherent bias in any group of people who choose to do a particular thing, after all, and those who choose to raid regularly are probably most likely to be those who *can* keep up -- thus, not really a fair and accurate representation of everyone who is their age. It's certainly a question worth asking, and I do think people are too quick to blame their age sometimes, but please keep in mind that your personal very small anecdotal experience doesn't automatically mean that everyone who has trouble keeping up with fast-paced classes just needs to "git gud". 
---
You would be doing god's work, should such a deity be worthy of worship.
---
How would this impact the game negatively? You could block the inspection if you don't like it. Also, appart from high lvl fractals and raid, nobody cares about your gear. Anyway, it's so easy to gear up with exo that most people prob wear something just fine, maybe not full ascended + infused but def not flame worthy.
---
Part of the chair, part of the crew.
---
&gt; As long as its consented to
---
Except this wouldn't fix the problem. Say they did add what you said. You join a fractal or a raid and they *demand* to see your stuff and you refuse, what will happen? You will be kicked. Thus the system is pointless and it *forces* players to bend the knee and do it because its now the norm, and that's why it should never be added. The moment something this stupid becomes the norm is when the game devolves into something that isn't GW2.

He can't be the happiest if all the others are equally happy.

Anet is known not to pay well apparently
---
gp huh hi fellow scapper
---
I'd love a heroic edition to give my cousin!
---
Honestly you can get into raids really easily. Gear up a power warrior or magi scourge, join Raiders in Training / Raid Academy / etc, and watch some guides and follow instructions. Boom, you're a newbie in raids. Those two builds (particularly magi scourge with mercy runes) are dirt cheap to gear in exotics.
---
Also, don't capitalize "charr" unless it's in a title or at the beginning of a sentence. It's just a regular noun.
---
Hint: Find a bobblehead laboratory.
---
No worries. This happens to me all the time. Just that the headline of that article that was posted, saying our sales were down tends to make people panic. We've had quarters lower than this already quite a long time ago. I'm just pointing out it's all part of the cycle, and that one down quarter isn't really cause for alarm and that it's happened before and will no doubt happen again.
---
I think a lot of people would be less panicky if Anet actually told us they were working on another expansion, which I haven't heard them say yet. 
---
I think expansions are necessary to drive people to return to the game to keep the numbers going back up periodically. But either way, the game is still doing fine. 
---
I have an old friend that was a a specialized WoW GM, forget which tickets his department dealt with as we haven’t talked since moved to the job years ago. Facebook post today from him saying his entire department as well as others of similar stature got laid off and the GM/player support dep. was being consolidated into one team. 
---
I was the other way around at launch. Played a necro during the beta weekends, found it to be clunky and boring. Made a dagger/dagger Elementalist at launch and fell in love with the game
---
###BUILD TEMPLATES###
---
But with the money saved from firing 800 people they managed to hire one whole new CEO! Result!
---
Dagger x2 Elementalist was fun (and probably still is), but I found that I had to be too close to enemies and, at the time, wasn't as adept at preventing myself from taking damage (dodging and positioning). Necro was nicer for me because I could better keep my distance and had a pet that could damage for me if I needed to face away for a moment.
---
And trimming fat in other staff areas. My buddies entire GM/player support department got laid off today, essentially consolidating the player support team and sending ticket referrals to “outside parties” according to his Facebook post. (which I assume means) outsourcing. 
---
Well, guess I should check and see if the tonic is correct as well now
---
Heroic Edition would be really nice, thank you.
---
... and then you alone are stuck in combat with the moa while everyone else has moved on at full speed to the next target.
---
You don't have to be so rude and asshole with OP.
---
Not really interested right now in another franchise. I'm much more interested in world building in the current game and I see no reason why they should deviate from that just because a percentage of the playerbase gets caught up in an aging game mindset.

People often dismiss thief as it's a low health medium armor class, but it's a common misconception about their sustain. A full Zerk Daredevil has more sustain with the combination of Invigorating Precision and Healing Signet than every class but Necro. Go offmeta for open world with Acrobatics and you get even more sustain and boon uptime. 
---
Plus Thief DPS rotation is so easy you can do competitive DPS with just auto attacks and minimal utility use.
---
It was ninja-fixed last Tuesday I think.
---
Ranger danger. Ew
---
The Silverwastes is a core area that is basically a demo version of the first expansion. I'm not sure how, but I'm pretty sure f2p players can reach it (though I am not certain). You can sort of get the feel of how difficult the game gets.
---
There are a ton of things that I really like about the new map (nice NPC dialogue, ambience, layout, etc.) but I have to say... I've done the south meta dozens and dozens of times at this point, and I *still* can't tell what's happening there 99% of the time. The boss is the same color as the oil all over the ground, and it moves around the area constantly while you're slip-sliding trying to get to where it was a moment ago. There's oil spewing everywhere and purple lightning and snow all over the place, a ton of AoE circles on the ground, and 50+ people all trying to whack something that I suspect half of them can't even see. I generally make sure to take a ranged class with me, because that's the only way I can be absolutely sure that I'm actually hitting the stupid thing at any given moment.
---
I understand why they buffed its hp because it *was* dying really fast, but now I have to deal with that torture for another 30 seconds and it feels like a punishment at this point. Love the zone, hate the bossfights.
---
Hiya! Would love a GW2 Heroic code, thanks so much!
---
I tried to low-key push my buddy off a cliff, being all subtle about it, then he says "don't you *dare*" and I was like "ok you got me"
---
That's cute, except there's no Armadillo in this  picture.
---
yes, sadly sounds like that... Well at least now you can put on her face that GW2 has the best mount system ever now... 
---
But yeah, sadly your sister is not ready to try in general because she is in love with BDO, all good points are forefronts and bad points are either ignored/rarely seen/forgiven.
---
as a mmo vet I stuck to my favorite mmo for 12 years and for me while I tried many and some lasted up to 6 months they could never pull me apart... until one day I decided to try one of the games on a list i had, GW2... Then I was gushing about 5 minutes on teamspeak about how I was bending my knees and my ankles were also flexing naturally ON A ROCK in the tutorial zone while turning around my camera made my character turn and well... 
---
Here I am almost 4 years later...
---
GW2 in a sense opened my eyes that my old mmo was like a abusive relationship while GW2 was the boyfriend giving his best to appeal to my wishes (sometimes failing, sometimes beyond expected) and i found that nice and fresh and well... 
---
and really, people complain of grind of "new" games like BDO... I wasted 6 months for a 5% on a level 97 with playing 10 hours a day each day... (and I was killing groups of 25-40 mobs for 0.03% exp)
---
oh yeah, also your sister complains but I remember you couldn't get your damn mount until you reached the other city so... yep just give up on her for now.
---
thanks, I hate it 
---
I would imagine that they're already doing *very* early prototyping / design experiments for GW3 on a new engine. That said however, I very much doubt we'll hear anything about GW3 *at least* until such time as the overarching plot of GW2 is close to wrapping up.
---
I'm sure they'll eke out as much as possible from GW2, but the reality is the game is going to eventually hit a wall in terms of what they can achieve technically and mechanically, as did GW1.
---
I use action cam and I still have autotarget off. It's so much easier for me to just attack in a general direction or right click to target unless it's a giant zerge where I can't see anything anyways.
---
If you wanna go for something valentines day related i would go for something from the gemstore like the chocolate or something like that, if its available.
---
Same here, I only do Jade Maw now (and it can still be a huge pain depending on the instabilities).
---
My favourite map probably is Jahai Bluffs. Even now that I've gotten my Temporal Tourist title, I still come back to farm mistonium and putter around the map even though I don't need to be there. 
---
I've map completed it 7 times. I'm glad the hearts aren't tedious.
---
Least favourite: all of Orr. I hate it so much. The enemies, the environment, the squillions of points of interest which are not interesting at all. *Everyone, come!*
---
Yes that’s why dodge jumps are a thing in pvp 
---
A GW2 heroic edition or Eye of the north code would be a wonderful surprise.  Thanks for giving these away.
---
There is no such thing as something that's not flame-worthy on the internet. And blocking inspection won't do anything for you, because people will treat you as if you "failed" inspection. It will have the same effect on you whether you like it or not.
---
I've seen some decent points raised about how it could be nice for showing friends your gear or asking for gearing help or something, but IMO those benefits would be miniscule and rare compared to the massive negative elitism it would enable. 
---
Or 'proofread'?
---
True, though at least it would let some groups know exactly what's wrong with a person's build, allowing them to give the player feedback. Right now, it's quickest to just boot players that are assumed to be lying.
---
And stalking you... I left one game because of that... he started to grieve me until I will accept a duel.
---
Nah, they didn't say they *hated* dungeon skins, only that they didn't care. Neutral.
---
The chances of getting a specific skin you've been coveting is pretty small, anway, so I imagine getting a dungeon skin instead wouldn't be any more disappointing than getting anything else.
---
If people want to see your gear right now they ask you to link it in the chat and if you don't, you fail inspection. Besides, as I've pointed earlier, it could just be a wardrobe inspection without the stats. 
---
You're right! I totally forgot about dodge jumping. That also works out of combat so that would mean that dodging in general helps you go faster, interesting.
---
Even if you play meta, you get flamed if by any chance you forgot to swap something if you do other content... many people I know do wvw and raids on hardcore statics and many can tell you why they blocked a x-player due to linking a wrong piece and getting kicked (one wasn't even the wrong piece but one wrong rune)
---
I get called out “gay hacker” soo idk.. thats worse maybe? 
---
Would love the heroic edition code. And thanks for doing this giveaway.
---
In addition too paying there devs under market, Glassdoor indicates that mentioning making build templates will get you fired.
---
Tab tab tab tab
---
Omg it her. The madlass herself.

Is this OPs raid data? That would explain your username perfectly
---
Heroic edition key for a friend if there are any left pleasee
---
There's a difference betweening saying, your DPS is too low, sorry and fuck you die. That's all. There's nothing wrong with telling someone their DPS is too low. There's NO REASON EVER to be abusive. It's not justified. Ever. Report and block are options. But they don't change the rules of the game. And abuse is against the TOS.
---
The mini eye seems cool.
---
Thanks for doing the giveaway.
---
heroic edition key would be nice, just got a friend to try it and hes liking it so far.
---
ALL THE DAMN TIME.
---
Tab-target in this game is awful. Seriously.  
---
The obvious priority should be
---
1) Red, In my FOV &amp; in range of any attack. Closest through furthest.   
---
If nothing matches that, then   
---
2) Any red in range of any attack. Closest through furthest.   
---
If there are no reds in range, THEN pick whatever random-ass pig is hiding behind me.
---
Yellow should be absolute last resort. Not first.
---
peep dps
---
In my experience if there's a GODZILLA LORD in front of me, and a yellow pig I can't even see, behind me, it'll target the pig every time.
---
Very talented my man
---
They're hard, but rewarding in a fun way. I find 99cm to be harder than 100cm. For example in Siax fight it's often impossible to ress a dead ally while in 100cm allies can be ressed without as much pressure. 
---
Also I play on high latency so the bullet hell part often gets me. I can pretty much solo the bullet hell in normal 99, but I've yet to do that in 99cm. 
---
Nightmare had always been my favourite fractal, but now I'm gonna say I like 100cm more heh. 
---
There she be!  Yay! All props to this wuff!
---
Daredevil or even herald could do the same more effectively (and so does weaver which is shown in the first fight). You're essentially cleaving downeds since no one else besides weaver is doing damage.
---
Burst on 5 people has much bigger effect than small damage on whole squad, even if they both result same total damage. There's difference between creating downs and cleaving them.
---
Besides, performing well in a very specific scenario (whole group perfectly lined up) hardly makes a class meta.
---
To put it gently, there are some *very distinct personalities* in the 'band.
---
Wuff's workflow is amazing. Seriously. If you ever get a chance to watch her stream, do it.
---
This is the absolute worst on the last boss in the swamp fractal with waves of critters but NO LETS TARGET THE INVULN BOSS
---
Thread removed: Low-effort/-value post.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
WvW is basically your open world duelling. You can use obsidian sanctum if you need to meet someone specifically.
---
As for gear inspection: the GW2 community is too carebear and abhors accountability, it will never happen. It's all about no effort, all the rewards.
---
Well at least I know I can avoid missing pieces since I double/right click to swap pieces but accidental single/quad clicks results in one of the pieces being wrong
---
You underestimate how little effort people put into gear even when it comes to team-oriented activities.
---
Apothecary Rifle warrior ... *The horrors*
---
Telling someone to uninstall the game becuase their DPS isn't up to par is, in no way, shape, or form, "constructive criticism".
---
Is just that i still not get used to the "equip on 2 slot" option and forget about it and do it old style.
---
Exactly, or well, precisely promoting the idea that game devs should have passion and therefore do what they want to be doing and therefore should not ask so many questions about wages, jobsecurity and crunch and harassment in the workplace, etc. etc.
---
Having passion is great, but a lot of people can have passion in what they do and not all of them get treated as poorly as (some) game devs.
---
People should learn to be accountable in any team activity, instead of straight up lying about what they have while using some mish mash of carrion, apothecary and soldier gear with major runes of grenth.
---
If they can't be bothered with the bare minimum then they can play with friends or people that don't care.
---
&gt; ~600LI Ascended + 1x Full stat infusions min
---
I have over 700li and don't have stat infusions.
---
They only add like 1-3% damage, highly unneeded if you are the average player with multiple dps classes
---
I always feel good about inflicting 1,437,549 damage on a random rabbit during Champ battles myself. 
---
I.e.: you could have the best product in the world, but it wouldn't matter if nobody knows it exists.
---
You don't have to swap legends often with Glint/Jalis Herald while you are doing open world stuffs.
---
You turn on regen, might and fury and autoattack in Glint. Your energy does not drop with those three turned on, unless you use weapon skills. If you do, you swap to Jalis, turn on the spinning hammer and you can stay in Jalis for 45 seconds if you just autoattack. That's not a lot of keypresses.
---
I don't, but I also don't see how calling someone bad is considered toxic. It's a fact and if you don't like it then work on improving it or play with someone on same level, no toxicity and pointing fingers needed at all. And there's always reason for flaming, they can be good or bad, but they exist.
---
It also doesn't change the fact that a lot of people want to free loot and try to be invisible in the group chat so they don't get noticed, for no good reason (why would you waste someone else's time? How is that not toxic?). It's not hard to say "I'm new so I might have issues with x, y or z, hope it's alright" or something along those lines when joining more experienced group. 
---
No one has chances without full story.
---
How long is ur neck beard
---
If you don't think that telling him to uninstall the game is being an asshole, than i have nothing else to say.
---
Or it targets the right mob the first time but you accidentally press tab again and when you spam tab trying to get back to the boss it suddenly doesn't exist 
---
Try giving d912pxy a try. I have a relatively current and reasonably high end rig, and I was having fps issues prior to using it. Note that it is still in Alpha testing and has some bugs, but I'm very happy with it.
---
the expansions add end game content... so therefore... it is needed to access end game content? since endgame content before expansions came out was the endgame content in core gw2 but since new expansions come out therefore making the previous endgame not endgame anymore since a new expansion adds new game for the end of the game thereby making the new end game the endgame of the game. 
---
Yet you're the one calling holo meta for winning a small scale fight where you have advantage and disengaged twice while enemy was still in combat..
---
We need your full specs to be of any help. CPU, GPU, RAM amount and if possible speed. Also are you running on HdD or SSD
---
on my RTX 2080 Ti, GW2 will sometimes present such a low GPU load, that the GPU core drops to idle frequencies, which then causes a sudden loss of performance. check with GPU-Z and watch if the GPU freqency jumps up and down drastically or not.
---
while you are using GPU-Z, check and see if you are getting a full PCI-e 3.0 16x. GW2 likes to use a ton of PCI-e bandwidth, and a hobbled connection will directly affect your game performance.
---
OF COURSE YOU CANNOT PLAY WITH FRIENDS! people with friends just play with friends in real life.
---
You can't go better for Valentine's Day than a Mini Undead Chicken
---
Im not basing that on any fact, so it is just an opinion, but looking at the game I don't see what more it can do. Maybe they'll announce GW3 soon? I'd be hyped for that! Or maybe I'm wrong and the living story will open up a new avenue to expand into.
---
Look at how lackluster their events are. They just patch in the same thing every year. Even their Living Story is a bit dull.
---
Wow. I just realized that the problem isn't GW3 is going to end soon, but that I'm a grumpy bittervet .
---
I apologize! 
---
I understood this much better after finding out that guardian GS skill 3 can't be used as an escape if auto target is on
---
lol
---
Doesn't work. All that setting does is guarantee that GPU clock never drops below base 3D clock speed, which is 1350Mhz, exactly the speed to which the card drops to when load is too low.
---
Very well said and this is definitely part of what I was getting at.
---
I am okay with losing horrendously. It happens; there are many players better than myself and I accept that. This was not the same thing. I didn't feed into the map chat with them; I ignored them. It doesn't change the fact that their behaviour is not ok.
---
What is most frustrating is that the community as a whole seems to accept this kind of behaviour. The comments here support that.
---
yeah, and if they did this "You can always say in group chat that you're new and might have problems with encounter." I think you'll find that they won't get this treatment.
---
Flaming a new player for being bad makes a person an asshole, but flaming a new player for lying their way into you squad (for example) is very deserved. You gotta make a distinction, and I'm not certainly about to just automatically assume that the op had good intentions, because let's be real here; well intentioned people who get mistreated are generally the very small minority. He's said nothing would convince us that he is a part of that minority. 
---
I certainly wouldn't just lay the judgement down that he has done wrong, but I'm not going to be naive and pretend he's story checks out, especially when he magically keeps getting this same treatment for different strangers.
---
In fact, I did not feed the opposing team. Nor am I anything else you assume I am.
---
If this wasn't here I was damn well gonna post it after seeing that picture.
---
nothing to do with being a bad player
---
ok
---
Hope so, I just started playing.
---
I alt tab and come back and my game crashes.  I dunno if it's just me or has this been happening to others?
---
What about just making your own fractal group or joining one without that requirement?
---
Both of these are stupid ideas , and a huge pain in the ass. 
---
#1.) Duels : I don't want a bunch of 15 year olds running up to me screaming "duel me , duel me" even if I have duels auto turned down. Then they whisper you for an hour bitching and calling you names , or trying other ways to grief you. Because that is what happens in games with dueling.
---
#2.) Gear Checks: Just another way to exclude people. And opting out is not a real possibility, because if you don't agree to it , you'll just get automatically kicked.
---
precisely this
---
I remember my first times as a longbow ranger in wvw. I tried escaping with gs 3 a ton of times and I didn't understand why it randomly went towards enemies all the time.
---
Fucked me over good a few times haha
---
That is a matter of practice though :) 
---
This is the best advice. Go with this advice ^^
---
Cantha is supposedly in the works.
---
Living world season 4 ends around April.
---
Anet have suggested that LWS5 will release after the end of season 4, with no expansion in-between.
---
Living world seasons have typically ran for over a year.
---
So unless they break the formula and dump an expansion somewhere in between, an expansion is not on the horizon.
---
Nooo! The CORRECT answer is for ANet to fixxor the fuxxored coding. :D
---
Thanks for doing this giveaway. I would like to have the Guild Wars 2: Heroic Edition. 
---
Thank you!
---
Simple Anet didn't want to implement it. The devs wanted to give the sense of the races working together to overcome the dragons and that wouldn't makes sense if everyone was killing each other. As for the gear inspect it so people can't be discriminated against based on time played and they are judged on skill.
---
&gt;He's a human commoner I think?
---
Well, no *wonder* your friend hates his personal story. Should've picked Charr! :P
---
Seriously, the Charr have a really great set of stories.
---
Ok, great, I'll have to give the warrior a try then. Thanks!
---
Or maybe they are killing competitive content and going back to original gw goals where nothing matters and everyone just plays for fun,  admire beautiful maps and effects and praise map completionists.
---
Okay I've came to the conclusion GW2 was a bad idea. Look just because Anet decided to make GW2 and abandon GW1 (for 5 years) doesn't mean they will do it again. I feel sorry for the devs its as if the community wants them to kill off GW2 Z has said GW2 has more to come in the anniversary video in August last year, the many interviews during the anniversary, during the livestream at the end of last year and the anniversary livestream last year. No offence but I'm going to listen to the devs and that means GW2 is continuing and the community needs to accept that. This is the problems with sequels people expect you to just drop a game when it gets to a certain age and move onto another one.
---
He's actually a fan of military-ish things and I told him that he would've loved the charr story since the charr have a more militarized lore and story. He refuses out of dedication since he's lvl 20 and doesn't want to start over.
---
No for one Anet publishes GW2 now and have done since 2015, two GW has been one of the most successful franchises for NCSoft next to Lineage and Aion and thirdly Wildstar was shut down because it wasn't that good and couldn't keep people. I see new players in Queensdale any time I log in.
---
Your whole mindset (considering your posts): you are all wrong, I am right. I am treated unfair and you all have to say that I am treated unfair. If not, you are unfair and therefore a fanatic. 
---
Yeah, I see where your downvotes come from. Even though this sub tends to overract sometimes there are threads which are negative BUT constructive. Your post is just whining. 
---
Well, if you lose your job, you kinda need a new one quick. Unlike a widow
---
Honestly, doing some of the Griffon Mastery courses helped me figure it out pretty quickly. Still no where near the op's madness, but passable at least.
---
I tried telling him that as well but he was steadfast in continuing with that character.
---
Also, I did try to rush from lvl 15-20 just to get to the story missions but I've been taking it slow since. Level 41 at the moment just from general exploration.  
---
Wow. Rough day mate?
---
yeah youre right it is too much to expect people to be able to do simple dodging, looking at your screen is way to hard, best to take the safe approach that takes x5 longer and put all the responsibility onto 2 people
---
do you know where they went?
---
Can they sustain a healthy playerbase with map completionists though? In my experience these kind of players are mostly gone after a couple of months, maybe logging in for a week after every new LW release. Don't forget this is meant to be a MMORPG, it should incentivice you to log in for a couple hours every day. That's why daily fractal rewards exist.
---
just another day of lfg pugs that dont deserve the kill
---
From comments of other players gw2 wasnt intended for every day login, more of a come and go whenever you want.
---
I tried wvw for a while, but situation isn't much better. 
---
Find/create your own static. Problem solved.
---
i would assume that people cant dodge there either, with would explain why the game mode is filled with necros
---
the mindset of being able to press v or double tap?
---
The best part is that people manage to fail mid strat as well somehow. 
---
A mastery that makes you slide around would be pretty shitty. On the other hand there is a spot in Thunderhead Keep that makes me wonder why they didn't make a skiing minigame ...
---
If that sounds like you, then yes?
---
Fake push and half the pugs die. Enemy moves 3 steps in front and the other half wipes. At that point you're left with 20 people on voice chat not knowing if you should laugh or cry.
---
Thanks a lot for this return ! 
---
I add a new video to this playlist everymonth if you want more stuff like this 🤗
---
Minitures into a mini game, where the are turned into a pokemon system like wow, or a card system like ff. I dunno, but something needs to be done with them. They are absolutely worthless atm other then following you around and slamming the servers with their sketchy animations (that might be mainly because I'm oceanic) 
---
Sadly still dead.
---
I'd love a Guild Wars 2: Heroic Edition. 
---
If I happen to get it, I will force my brother to play with me. ^.^
---
I honestly think the issue is way over-stated. Nothing really changed. People had zero awareness and inability to do mechanics even in t4s before, and nothing is different. Maybe it's more noticeable now. But it's really surprising how quickly people put on rose tinted glasses and start asking for the old, uninspired and frustrating instabilities to return. Good riddance.  
---
  
---
If they changed anything, I would like the ability to choose our instabilities, and then have daily instability rewards (to discourage finding "optimal" combinations). Let us get better rewards for using MORE instabilities. Make it a true challenge mechanic, something that involves choice and risk reward, not just an RNG snoozefest.
---
You had a good run: personally, I have disliked the way A.Net does group content since the AC rework. I like CoF1: it's fast and it's easy. You go in with a random group of bads, view some sights (it's PvE after all!), spank some bosses, get some loot and say GG. The perfect 5 gaming minutes.
---
But then I look at fractals specifically, and they are getting super elaborate, taking ages to do, with tons of bullet hell, ... and that's on top of ascended which remains one of the biggest let downs for a GW1 nut such as myself.
---
GW2, for me, is a single-player, open-world game. It's the only content that still works.
---
*Stupid corpse.*
---
Just as advice on how I’ve seen it successfully in the past, it you pug a group that you like, just ask them if they’re on discord somewhere and then ask if you could join them for more raids. Usually nobody would say no to that if all parties are friendly :) 
---
I finish the listed achievements and map completion from each release in well under a week, typically by day 2 unless there are timegates or massive farms (Dragonsblood Weapons). Even at that, it isn't hard to finish and is just leaving so much of nothing to do. I'm a vet player but I have far less time than you, so not sure what you're doing wrong with optimizing your time to get things done within that overly graceful 3 month period of time. I'd rather things go back to how it was in LS2, fewer maps, but let them expand every 2 weeks like DT and SW did. The story felt more fluid and paced correctly, where as now.. it is so much of nothing between releases except repeated festivals. 
---
I have personally never really had issues with tab targeting. It even seems to weed out the real Mesmer for me 99% of the time.
---
maybe you have tab targeting set to closest target rather than next target in your settings? That would explain why it would jump between 2 targets rather than cycling thru all targets in range.
---
if there are 6 season in lws5, then perhaps september 2020?
---
One of the Gw2 heroic edition codes would be phenomenal. Ty OP and best of luck to everyone.
---
If fullscreen, and moreover with arcdps, it still can crash.
---
This is a cursed image
---
&gt;  But it's really surprising how quickly people put on rose tinted glasses and start asking for the old, uninspired and frustrating instabilities to return. 
---
Are we reading the same post? The OP's claim is that while the old ones were bad the new ones are worse.
---
Which is sure going to make alternative offensive Might share viable on other bosses. Or on Matthias... Wait a second, only possible because of explode plasma? Never mind. 
---
Clean af. Nothing else but gg 
---
Server architecture is great for players to beta test? 
---
That isn't too different from the current LFG tool. I haven't done fractals or dungeons (at least not since 2012) but for the things like meta events, world boss trains, bounties, etc. people will just join through the tool and then leave when they're done. At most you might get a hello and thanks at the end, which is no different to a dungeon group in XIV or w/e. 
---
i love data thank you!
---
Not All of people do this, but all of rangers do this.
---
&gt; T4 is about adapting to situations,
---
I've seen people die 4 times in a row at the exact same spot because none of them has the ability to react to stuff or learn from their past mistakes. I imagine they're all used to playing pure glass DPS with a dedicated healer, but we were in a pug group and we didn't even have a single healer.
---
in an age where companies are more concerned with pushing yearly sequals rather then make decent games, this mentality was doomed to emerge.
---
like video game Stockholm syndrome
---
Uh, I just started GW2 and don't have a code yet - that would be awesome!
---
Also I heard good things about Eye of the North and would very much appreciate the possibility to play :-)
---
&gt;if there are 6 season in living world season 5
---
excuse me what?
---
This actually got me interested in finding out if such is mandatory regulation or not. I know that it's common practice, but different manufacturers would number them differently. I've seen 20-sided dice where the numberings are "weird" but it's not explicitly "wrong".
---
So long as they're not loaded, it's still technically fair, I believe, even if non-standard. At least from what I've been able to find out.
---
What's more concerning than the numbering placement, is the fact these dice are solid and not transparent. This makes it easier to have some internal weight to tip the scales of probability. And if the paint for the white is not of the same density as the material, that further alters it (making 6 side heavier or lighter than the rest).
---
if you're only going to play casually, I'm going to assume mainly open world pve? In which case a power necro can roll over just about anything solo.
---
Assuming you might occasionally want to do fractals as well, power Reaper and condi Scourge both have reliable and easy to learn DPS builds for fractals.
---
Could just stop worrying about it and enjoy the game I guess.
---
Hope a Dev sees this
---
You can mail your friends the bread. That’s the closest to trading besides trading posts.
---
Really weird why gw2 haven’t implementing a trading UI yet.
---
nothing is announced.
---
ppl are panicking and think anet is gonna end the game for some reason.
---
I stopped playing fractals for a while, then tried to get back in after the instabilities patch, and it's simply ridiculous - people just keep dying and dying. Either everyone who could dodge suddenly stopped doing fractals, or there's something wrong with these new mechanics.
---
Yeah compared to archeage, gw2 has lesser skills. But they work in a combo-like fashion and all of them has a purpose.
---
Archeage is really cool too, their 120 classes thingy sounds nice on paper but we know there are only a few good combinations that are meta.
---
I almost barfed reading that 
---
Your flair...... Not sure if you heard the news. You need to check your waifu!
---
Also I didn't see any comments about key bindings. Have you changed those or are you playing with the original ones?
---
If this happens on camera moves, especially after map load, or when you move thru area: this is how gw2 works.
---
😀
---
huh, meant 6 episodes in lws5, must have been that beer.
---
edited above comment
---
ya :( Its just weird as some things they have in gw1 
---
I'd like the Heroic Edition thanks.
---
Don't beet yourself up about it
---
Well, people were just optimistic. "OMG That last laugh + toxic trail + social awkwardness, we've wiped once, our druid is trash! Anet promised nice re-work and more "fun and advantages from instability""
---
And now we get "25% advantage, 350% disadvantage" shit and "fun" combos like frailty + outflanked + birds with random new mob spawning behind you and insta-killing you. Or birds on aetherblade (do you want to die to birds or die to zappy field? you still die :P). Or social awkwardness on zappy field with literally not enough space ("you shall spend 10 minutes trying to do it one by one! stupid players were too fast in t4").
---
Now wait until they do solid ocean hentai fractal re-work. We'll be treated to crap-changes like extra bonus 5 rooms full of dredge we'll have to kill in intricate pattern (or they'll run after you through half the fractal) and then final encounter will be 30 minutes long with idiotic mechanics. All in the name of "well, this fractal was _the shortest_" (you know, mathematically speaking there's always "the shortest" one in the list, until you end up with identical length items, 3 hour pug runs for the same rewards, here we come!)
---
oh true :O but then comes the gem salvage kit :D to get you your charge out. but again might be worth it.
---
Maybe a mobile game
---
Basically the answer to new instabilities is "T4s are not worth it with non-statics". 
---
It's inevitable
---
Pretty much, yep.
---
Maybe I'll try heal druid then, cause it took me a long time to get geared XD. Only have the amulet left but that's ok cause it's not needed for AR. Just not familiar with the rotation or how difficult it is to use :P
---
Who is? Genuinely curious
---
Hehehehe at first I saw mickey mouse, till I read the text, now I see Winnie the Pooh.  
---
I love to see the start of a drawing, like this. I can't draw at all, but I wish I could.   
---
 
---
Run domi and boonstrip on shatter and warrior can stay core for bosses you need the cc.
---
We don't know.
---
Except you cannot be "raid ready" in a day, you cannot buy ascended equipment or skill points with cash.  
---
Even if you buy a level 80 booster and convert gems to gold to bring weapon and armor crafting to 500 to craft ascended equipment, you still need ascended trinkets and other stuff you cannot buy; not to mention you still have to unlock the elite specialization for it, since no-one can raid on base specs alone (maybe just warrior \^ \^).
---
So, it's way more practical and realistic to play the game and unlock stuff than buy it, wich, to be honest, even if you maange to be "raid ready" in a day, you'll probably will be unable to use you character even decently in raid.  
---
&gt; going back to original gw goals.
---
Original GW2 Goals. GW1 was all about competitive content
---
Nobody is saying the old instabs were great. All I can say is for me this is the first time since like 2016 where I don't enjoy doing fractals anymore. I only log on to raid on mondays and maybe do dailies for the rest of the week. CMs+T4 was a part of my day I actually looked forward to and recently I just wanted it to stop immediately after we started. Awful fractals like Deepstone and Siren's reef sure don't help with that...
---
TOTO IS NEVER IRRELEVANT
---
Wooow :O yea, I would hit every lamppost, house, pillar, tree on my way. And probably crash and hit the ground a few times :D xD   
---
Well done ! :D   
---
Was it worth it?
---
With pressing 5? I mean we try heal thief there i make my thoughts and after s1 cry mimimi  i have not enough i heal i switch and my (uni)tests started. Its new to me black powder is a smoke field thought u mean for reveald training also idk how much dmg smoke field finisher is for mirage i know it's dmg but i thought its not that much when i would play heal i'm sure it more usefull playing with smokefields(what i was doing as we play with heal thief) but i only upsed cause you are so fucking rude
---
Well, I can understand why players are playing like they want, I'm doing that myself. However, I am also valuating my time and the one of people in my group. So, are you asking me to choose between my comfort and yours ?
---
I won't ask for benchmark figures, ever. But even then, absolute relativity is crap, there is a minimal level to reach to be useful to others in group content. If you don't want to do the slightest effort to pull your own weight, you don't deserve this group content, and you should stay in open world (you as in "anybody").
---
Well playing boonbest is close to cheating :D
---
Maybe just because when they developped gw2, cooperation between players was always the thing they wanted. Shared loot, down system and xp from rez are good examples. 1v1 in open world is a competitive thing.
---
I guess almost everybody agreed at the beginning. Players coming from original Guild Wars were not used to a duel option.
---
And maybe because they didn't want to copy/paste WoW too. And that's still a good thing.
---
Damn, this is so nice of you. Instead of selling them or something you do good deed intead. *bows*. I am interested in the gw2 heroic edition. Good luck everyone and take an example from this person.
---
Amen!
---
i had to re buy them too :(
---
Having some texture bugs, where characters in the dialog screens are getting a black &amp; white checkered texture.
---
I repaired the game, and it got better, but still have the issue from time to time. Anyone knows a fix for this?
---
Awesome! GW2 Heroic for me so I can further lure my wife into Tyria with me :Dc
---
A friend of mine really wants to play GW2 with me but the F2P restrictions bother him. I would love to get a code for the heroic edition of GW2 to unlock the restrictions from his core game. 
---
One of those "why didn't I think of that moments". You sir, deserve a thousand upvotes.
---
Make it cost 10, 20, 50 charges per change, just gimme a sink for them charges. Got few hundred and counting just sitting there.
---
Did you say you have a Gritty mount? (Fyi, Gritty is the mascot for the Philadelphia Flyers in case someone doesn't know)
---
i think this plays in with their numerous "reworks" that nerfed mob and boss damage to an insane degree along with adding timegates and ressurect mechanics
---
volcanic shaman arrow for example..now it deals what? 2k? of course it would be too easy to complete so why not just add some "we bleed fire" to get people those spicy 20+ burn stacks
---
instead of a nice, decently telegraphed attack that you had to deal with..now you just pile on passive rng effects to create some artificial difficulty to fill in the vacuum made by dumb changes
---
Awesome! Have fun. If you're in EU, I might even to run into you somewhere...
---
I cringed so hard whenever friends/guildies/etc. mocked the pugs after gearchecking them but then got outdps by the very pugs. Anyone exposed to the superiority complex could turn into one of those wannabe elitists unknowingly. I don't like to blame a tool but i don't see a positive benefit from gearchecking.
---
Haha yeah you feel like they fly in! 
---
If you're fighting a boss and event UI has his healthbar on the right side of your screen, you can click that progress bar for easy targeting.
---
Are you not using ArcDPS build templates ? Will prevent this kind of mistake.
---
Awesome. Eye of the North would be great. But I don't have any of those, so one of the others works as well.
---
Nothing means nothing. Maybe he should have specified that we know nothing about an expansion, but we sure as hell know we’re getting season 5 right after 4. That is something
---
Yet they have requirements like "show 150 LI", and all the core group have barely 50. And won't ever be kicked if bad performance. So fuck this. Everybody lies at the end, and the only thing that matters is the performance.
---
I haven't played fractals since the change with the instabilities.  
---
So while I can't comment on it, maybe it might be a good idea to start a thread of instabilities that players would like.  That is ideas for new ones and with polls for finding the ones people like the most.  
---
I hope you dropped those "friends".
---
The blue die is even weirder, because it's a 5-sided die. Base is square.
---
You're right that they're not even close to regular shapes, but that blue one would be a square pyramid and wouldn't be fair even if it was consistent. 
---
Then I'll ask for the group I join to ping/show exactly what they ask for. Surprise surprise, half of the time they can't.
---
There’s a neat little thing called left mouse button that you can locate on, SURPRISE SURPRISE, the mouse. Just like how you would normally turn the camera when walking around, you can actually use it during combat as well! Turns out, when you simply click on said mouse button ( or right mouse button if you like action camera) you can switch to the target you want! Isn’t that amazing???? Now, go out into tyria and spread this message to your fellow microcephalic addle pates. I shall pray over your safety in the harsh world of tyria where the one true meta is to obviously spam aoe skills for y’all.
---
You make a good point, open world taxis slipped ny mind :)
---
Remember that story about that [asura with her moa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Tyrian_Travels:_Chapter_Three)? I hope the requiem does not suffer the same fate, abandoned and forgotten at some point. Afaik the employee had left the company.
---
The only time you should put an n on asura is if you’re talking about something made by or bearing the characteristics of the asura. Asuran architecture. Asuran golem technology. Etc. 
---
Sylvari is just sylvari and doesn’t denote plural, so sylvarus is bonkers. 
---
And this is, kids, is why we don't use autotargeting.
---
They might as well develop mobile or solo games to not hurt the current ones. The franchise has potential.
---
There are however hints suggesting possibility of no expansion. Whether you believe it or not is your own choice. Anet told us they want to stick with LW concept "for next few years" and that "expansion worthy" features are going to be included with lw episodes. That to me sounds like moving away from expansion concept or at least testing if they can do it without losing money. There are also other things happening in the background which nobody's going to take into consideration today, but will think about them back when Anet announces their new game.
---
Sylvari in general are very... British sounding so it wouldn't surprise me. It just sounds out of place in the context.
---
Already doing it. My first comment was half sarcasm, but apparently /u/MidnightPhantasm had someone piss in his cereals this morning.
---
yea thats true, the group is absolutely trash.
---
Heroic or eye of the north would be nice :p
---
 The things that make me different are the things that make me.
---
You can use/set up a keybind for "Nearest Enemy". That's what I use 90% the time. If that's not the one I want to attack (or if I want to tag many different enemies) I cycle through them with "Next Enemy" (it prefers enemies close to the middle of the screen). Only if that doesn't work quickly enough I try to use the mouse.
---
You know that the money spent in gemstore doesn't all go into new skins, right ? Those are cheap to create, in comparison to developping new content.
---
It does that tho, I did some testing about this a while ago. "Next Enemy" starts with the one nearest to the middle of the screen, and cycles by distance from that point (which varies if you move the camera around). It might be affected by enemy rank too, I haven't tested that, just got that impression while using it in the wild.
---
candy crush players and chinese market
---
i find it unlikely that anet would move away from xpacs after their success.
---
also what "hints" and could you link a source pls
---
As a huge fan and player of Guild Wars 2, I'll try my luck with GW: Eye of The North code or the Nightfall one, thank you for the giveaway! :) 
---
no ... 10+ months to get less then 400 gold? you can get 400 gold in 40 days of t4 fractals
---
I sometimes read those tombstones in Queensdale or Hoelbrak, some of them are funny or touching.
---
A heroic edition would be lovely for a friend that is new to the game!
---
neato, I like that it kinda looks like concept art
---
&gt; There are also other things happening in the background which nobody's going to take into consideration today,
---
Like what? You seem to keep implying all kinds of things in all of your posts, why don't you supply us with some actual information? 
---
I love that dialogue :)
---
Thank you for the giveaway! I always wanted to get into GW1, but I also love GW2. **I'd love a GW2 Heroic Edition** if I'm one of the lucky ones, and if all are out I'm also fine with just GW stuff \^\^ Good luck to everyone!
---
When I was first exploring the world I stopped so many times to just listen to the ambient dialogue :) I sometiems still find conversations I haven't heard before.
---
Elitism is wanting to play with people who put in the same effort as you do?
---
Instabilities should be an addition to fractals that make them fun to play because they are different everytime but fractals are definitely less fun after the instability updates. I think the instabilities before were just fine except social awkwardness but now we have even more "unfun" ones. 
---
Instabilities like slippery slope and we bleed fire on every enemy is just made for pure frustration. 
---
Make fractals with punishing and fun boss mechanics that you can learn to play around instead of simply throwing more trash and conditions into your face and do not try to make fractals more difficult through adding unfun instabilities.
---
I think players do like the cms more than the newer fractals because there are different boss fights with cool and new mechanics and not that much thrash in between the bosses. That makes sirens reef, twilight oasis and deepstone so unfun (for me at least) because they are long and simply annoying but not difficult.
---
The beetle race happens there - some people still occasionally run these. 
---
There are hints that suggest strongly something is happening in the background and that GW2 is going to stay as stable game, but not a priority for Anet for next few years.
---
1. Mike O'Brien gave away his mantle of game director to Zadorojny mentioning he's now going to take care of "other stuff" that are not related to GW2 specifically.
---
2. Anet has been hiring devs, some mobile devs specifically, for some time. Since GW2 has no official 3rd party extensions and making them 6 years after release would be a waste, I see one reason only for such hirings.
---
3. Zadorojny announced LW5 happening right after LW4, also saying they want to stick with this model for "next few years" and that "expansion worthy" features are going to be included with lw episodes. This to me sounds like they do not plan more expansions. Why is that? Probably because there is no expansion team anymore as devs has been moved to anet's new game project. So at the end gw2 is now being maintainted by LW team exclusively.
---
My "claims" about new game are an educated guess based on Anet's actions (and words) and my personal 20 year experience on the market. I do not claim it is 100% true, but I strongly believe this is what's happening in the backgrounds, one way or another.
---
You can easily complete it by gliding apparently, I read a reddit comment the other day about it!
---
It's so sad :&lt; Otoh the other day I randomly stumbled upon Dougal Keane in the Guild Initiative Headquarters in LA :D I was surprised, almost forgot who he was, I read that book years ago. (Also forgot that it's set just like a year before the start of the game, so the characters can be still alive.)
---
((Also that reminds me how I liked Ghosts of Ascalon, and what a monumental disappointment the other 2 books were compared to that &gt;_&gt;))
---
I get that the season following an expansion "belongs" to that expansion and that's great. But if they moved to season 5, skipped an expansion altogether and still added "expansion level content" then I don't see how that is a sustainable business model.
---
I didn't suggest selling the Living Story updates, by the way. I said it is economically silly to deliver expansion level content without charging for it. Deliver an expansion, follow it up by a Living Story season and then add content during that season. You make money by selling the expansion and from the ensuing microtransactions.
---
&gt; they actually care about their users
---
Ok, sure, but they are still a business. You can care about your users and still charging them for features/expansions.
---
And there are a ton of people who underperform, but the best shot we have right now is measuring that via LI. You can also leave groups if you think the group is bad. Not everybody lies, bad players lie. Bad players also perform like shit.
---
There's no reason for gearcheck not to be there.
---
Did you try gliding through it? I read a reddit comment somewhere that its much easier completing it this way
---
InS? Didn't it get deleted after the drama? Tpot left InS and when you left SALT? 
---
Darn. Everyone at work (not me) plays candy crush and those kind of games. That's a hard market to beat!
---
Ah, bobblehead Tequatl. Equal parts hilarious and terrifying :D
---
I love you for this!
---
Did you keep track of the keys to see the chance for 1, 3, or 10 crates?
---
Why do you think Blizzard is going with new Diablo to mobile market? Or why NCsoft is transferring most of its franchises into mobile? This is strong whale market not yet saturated by big AAA companies.
---
Why do ppl alway try to use Open World build for other purposes? If you want a raid or T4 build do not search for an open world build.
---
We bleed fire is worse than slippery slope imo, i would actually say it would be a good instability if only bosses could use it but as it currently is its awful.  Half the time the fireballs dont get reflected and it isnt even the fire that is the problem, its the fact that the firballs do like 6k damage that is unfun.
---
I don't think or agree with what people are saying about a GW3 and a GW3 and yet again a GW3. 
---
I think GW2's graphics sure look... seasoned, but because of their stylised look they are still relevant and okay, albeit dated. 
---
Anet could always start developing a new game but it wouldn't have to be a GW3. It can be a completely different one and new for them, or even some new mobile version of something - but I think it would be silly to make GW3 when GW2 still has a lot of story to tell and parts to explore. Plus its boring for creatives to work on the same thing for a 3rd time. 
---
As for when to speculate well.. let's see when August comes with their new Anniversary and maybe we get some trailers with info from them like last year. We will be into season 5 by then and see how everything progresses. Bottom line what they could do is just kill everyone and obliterate Tyria with Kralkatorrik and be like k bai everyone this is it for GW2 Thanks for joining! 
---
In nearly 1000 hours of play time, I've barely touched fractals due to the expense of the gear and a disinterest in instanced content.
---
All these threads are making me pleased that I only invested in two sets of ascended gear and 70 AR.
---
&gt;but I think the fact we're in *dread* instead of apathy is a big red flag. 
---
Yes! If you are constantly experiencing dread then the only advice I can give you is, if you sincerely love the game or that part of it, *stop playing immediately*. Wait for a fix. Because I've been there, buddy. I know that feeling. And in my experience, if I allow habit to make me continue playing something I once loved but now hate, I'm much more likely to quit. And when I return, the problem will be gone, but I'll feel no desire to play. I'll have forced myself to play for so long that whatever fires of passion I had were totally snuffed out.
---
I'd strongly advise you to take a break and wait for fixes. Do other content, or play other games. Because permanent burnout on MMO's sucks. It's time and money down the drain, and if you do enjoy the game again one day, you'll have missed out on a bunch of content. Better to take a break and come back wanting to play a fixed game than stick with it, burnout, and find yourself unable to enjoy it.
---
1. This is exactly what I said? Their desk placement is irrelevant to anything. He won't confirm working on new project until official announcement, duh, but his claim about not working much on gw2 anymore is pretty telling.
---
2. I never said they are going to replace gw2.
---
3. That's your point of view and has same possibility of validation as mine.
---
&gt; this evidence is mostly tangential and based mostly on assumptions.
---
Because it's not evidence and I said it's my educated guess. You can take it or not. Time will tell who's right on this.
---
&gt; it also doesn't make sense from a business perspective cuz why would anet want to jump to a new game given that xpacs proved successful?
---
Didn't I answer this already?
---
&gt; at best this shows anet is working on something new but nothing suggest that this thing is in some way meant to replace gw2
---
and I never said anything is going to replace gw2, I said dev power is being shifted, but GW2 is not going to be killed in the process.
---
Liking your thought process! But I should have been more specific... Her and I play religiously together at home and giving the fact it is Valentine’s Day today, I was thinking of throwing a curve ball and catching her off guard with a in game date. 
---
InS actually raided for a decently long time after he left, and even now people chat in discord every day because we didn't really disband, most of us just stopped playing the game at some point. Also there really wasn't a whole lot of drama tbh
---
Passes can be gifted, but right now the perma one isn't in the store, just the 2 week version.
---
So I am currently going through this journey myself, and after a hurculean amount of searching, I've found it as follows. 
---
First you need to gather all the materials to build a set of ascended gear for whatever crafting discipline + unlock the discovery recipe for zehtuka's exotic insignia. 
---
You'll need to spend the 30laurels and gold to get a set of any other ascended armors pieces recipes, and then craft all of THAT set, then stat swap all the pieces to harriers and slot in monk runes. That's the easier part. 
---
Weapons for harrier stats are a nightmare. Firstly, as a guardian you want a staff and mace shield combo. The mace n shield are pretty easy, as are an axe and greatsword. If you have weaponsmithing 500 you can reasonable make all of those bits using the method above, but for the staff if you're like me and had weaponsmithing and armor at 500, you're out of luck as staffs require artificing at 500. Imagine my surprise as my assumed 50 gold sink turns into 150 immediately. 
---
So to recap here's how you get a full set of harriers armor and weapons that are meta right now. We'll get to the trinkets in a bit. 
---
Have level 500 armorsmithing, weaponsmithing and artificier.
---
The materials to craft an entire set of ascended armour and an additional 6 exotic harriers insignias to stat swap, and since you wanna heal I'd suggest getting a set of monk runes from ascalonian catacombs. It's not too bad. Simply craft the other set of armor ( I went with zojjas and swapped to harrier as I can then gear up another toon in zerk ascended later) and then stat swap it to harrier by the forge. 
---
The weapons are the same deal. 
---
Now getting trinkets  is where I'm stuck ATM. You can get some gimmies as the mist talisman, and mist band from fractals allows you to select harriers stats and you can have two. You can get them in wvw or for pristine relics in fractals.  That's an easy way to knock out the accessories and rings. The hard part is now the amulet, and back. You can get a amulet from doing the achievements in path of fire act 2: all 18 of them. They're not completely horrible. 
---
The damn backpiece is the grind as it's all the acievements for the banner collections. It requires completion of path of fires story, and completion of all the hearts for 3 mounts and 3 masteries for the raptor. You can get other backpieces with select stats, but they take longer than the banner collection. 
---
Ah, oh well.
---
Auto-target OFF, action-camera ON. At least that's how I roll. 
---
duo caudecus' manor or arah
---
Is the glider dyable?
---
Time will tell :)
---
Was there? I must have missed that.
---
I was usually attempting this around reset, so what I do know is that one of them only managed to get their time on one day. The other had a time of at least 0:58 on five or six separate days, so I'm pretty sure that one wasn't an accident.
---
yes you can
---
No, not like Dragonstand please. Dragonstand is locked in content completely until the map resets. However, I would be okay with it being a map wide event like all the other HoT map that disables all the other events until Kralky is killed.
---
Definitely, it would be great to have the top 5 or 10 times on a public leaderboard, even if they're anonymized or something
---
Cartographer would have been a lot easier like this
---
To be honest I have no idea, I haven't bought it :D It was a bit of a sarcasm post :)
---
Nobody will really be answer that.
---
There are some time frames in which sales are happening listed [here](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem_Store#Special_sales) but if those sales do take place or what items will be available is not something we can say with certainty.
---
I've just been skipping it since Slippery Slope was made a permanent addition to 100cm.  It's not a matter of whether it's "possible," no one is really debating that -- it's just an extra layer of frustration that doesn't add any *meaningful* difficulty to the fight.  Punishing movement is something that you have to be very careful about because it doesn't affect all builds equally.  When push comes to shove sliding around just makes the game a lot less fun.  It's all shits and giggles until someone gets hurt and the tilt starts. 
---
It's odd how I actually completely loathe the new Social Awkwardness and in turn I'm fine with Slippery Slope compared to how this subreddit feels about them. I haaaaate being moved by teammates but controlling the sliding is quite easy for me (only move when you need to and use movement key that is counter to the direction i'm sliding and it cancels it pretty well.) but the birds are absolutely the most obnoxious shit. I don't like the random blind while I'm casting important skills (especially in my 1clone split DPS rotation) but the way these birds are considered enemy trash and you're trying to pull mobs together and it's the birds that you catch is really frustrating gameplay to me. Outflanked and the hard to see fireballs are also unpleasant but it really depends on what fractal you're doing. Getting Outflanked on the CMs is when it gets really shitty imo and getting the fireballs on another trash heavy fight when your vision is already reduced is also shitty but again they're not as frustrating as getting the birds constantly and not being able to leave combat because of them too.
---
3 to 4 weeks wait would be realistic I'd say. But my money is on next week. 
---
Pick something slightly intensive, or at least active. Go scavenging for collection achievements, work on story together, maybe do a run of story modes in dungeons. Maybe gift her a weapon or armor skin she likes but doesn't have too. There's plenty of stuff to do, the biggest thing is making sure you both have fun together. 
---
guild exist for that. but ppl would be kicked before even entering cause their stats are not meta ora are less meta than the fashion of the moment. raid and t4 elitism would spread everywhere. 
---
don't you remember wow ? this is not a bonus , it's a negative point.
---
even arcdps should not be allowed . 
---
and having good equip doesn't mean u are putting same effort. ever met someone u did the whole run watching a youtube video ? 
---
i have multiple full meta ascended characters with legendary and all so it's not my problem but it's not something i'd like to have
---
cool graphics anyway. i do not like the perma death mode but i suppose it's ok .
---
Any of these would be great! But I tend a bit more to the Nightfall I think! Thanks for the chance!
---
I think Hamstring is the more worse of the two when put into the combo. Simple because you won't be able make that jump on the small hole when the floor falls down. 
---
The [wiki article](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gem_Store/Gifting) on gifting might give you some more insights. :)
---
Sure. And I'll keep kicking people with your mentality because I don't want to waste my time.
---
In WoW it's really not a problem. It's not 'elitism', it's wanting to play with people with the same mentality as you. You don't want to do mythic raids in WoW with people who want to get carried, neither do you want to do open world with people who refuse to waypoint.
---
Not allowing arcdps is even more stupid. If you truly don't want people to be able to improve, then just keep joining all welcome runs.
---
&gt; Not allowing arcdps is even more stupid. If you truly don't want people to be able to improve, then just keep joining all welcome runs.
---
arcdps shows to party members too. 
---
"ppl with same mentality" : guild .
---
that's all. 
---
inspection and arcdps only lead to noobs shaming. 
---
" who refuse to waypoint" ???? what do you mean ? they did not unlocked the waypoint yet 
---
I would definitely be happy with  sth GW related possible the part that I could play immediately, always loved GW lore never really had a chance to get and play it xD Anyways thanks for giveaway and good luck to other ppl as well! 
---
It is for some reason not working on Taimi. I think she has perma bobblehead potion.
---
All those complaints make me just sad. I really love the new instabilites. Even if I miss the social awkwardness, which was a very good tool to prevent low ar people from doing high fractals, now theres a huge lack of agony in fractals, which makes agony itself kinda obsolet in most fractals.  
---
but tbh I love those new instabs, they make some fractals so much more challenging and thats what the 4 different tiers are made for. If the 3 istablities are too had for your, simply go down to t3 and do them, but I have to admit the birds thing is very strong, but all thats needed is a little nerf, just like the old toxic trail, which was the hardest instability ever until it got nerfed. 
---
To use such services gets YOU banned.
---
One thing I'd like to see is to have some kind of scaling applied to the per-mob instabilities. Champs should feel like they're more dangerous with the instabilities compared to normal rank mobs and at the moment some of them feel sort of inconsequential for champs but can be overwhelming from sheer numbers of trash mobs, which can feel unnecessarily punishing if you can't control the number of trash mobs being taken on at a time, like during boss fights.
---
 Examples for changes:
---
* Afflicted - it can be as simple as making normal mobs do one stack of the condis, vets do two stacks, elites do four stacks, and legendaries do eight stacks, and rebalance the durations around that. I don't know if afflicted takes the enemy's stats into effect, but if they do, the base damage should be standardized if we go with the stack approach, so people can easily intuit at which threshold they might want to start using condi clears. 
---
* Last Laugh - AoEs could be smaller on normal mobs and progressively larger for vets, elites, and champs. Adjust daze duration and/or damage accordingly?
---
* Toxic Trail - ditto above, adjust AoE size and damage based on mob rank
---
* We Bleed Fire - AoE size looks like it already scales but I'm not sure if that's just appearances. Damage and burn stacks could be adjusted based on mob rank.
---
* No Pain No Gain - Duration of applied boons could be shorter for lower ranked mobs?
---
There should definitely be some thorough testing with this, since some damage sources might be considered as coming from legendary-rank enemies, Artsariiv stands out as one that could end up being really ridiculous. So I understand that it's likely more difficult than my presentation may imply, as there's probably a lot of inconsistencies in how mobs are ranked or what counts as as the damage sources, etc.
---
As for Birds, one thing I can think of to salvage it is to have the effect feel more progressive, e.g. you start to see the birds floating around you (but they won't do anything yet), and if you don't dodge it will summon the birds on you which start to damage you, and if you still don't dodge it'll start applying blind. With a change in that vein, it could feel like there's real telegraph/counterplay to it, since at the moment it just feels like it's there to be a sudden annoyance rather than add any sort of complexity or interesting mechanics. Having it summon friendly birds if the dodge happens soon enough could be neat, too!
---
Slippery Slope seems to apply even without being in combat. Why not change it to only occur when a person is in combat, similar to Flux Bombs? In fact, as someone else noted, dropping a slippery AoE in the same style of a Flux Bomb could be an interesting change to it too, it could even knock you down after a while if you stay in it too long, somewhat like Matthias' chill fields or moving during his air phase? Just having the combat-only rule could go very far in preventing some of the really bad outliers some of which ended up getting hotfixed, like trying to platform in Chaos.  
---
I've got concerns about Outflanked, as it sounds like the type of mechanic that is prone to misbehave with latency. My ping is fairly stable so I haven't experienced any issues with it yet, but it may be a problem for others who have ping spikes and that may be worth investigating. e.g. It may be good to adjust the cone (I'm assuming) where characters are vulnerable? Others likely have better input.
---
Try it then post results here.
---
how will they ever detect him if he uses false name and another person's account? he is immune to responsibility for this
---
I can’t believe it was only 2 years between path of fire and heart of thorns. And this September it would already be 2 years since oath of fire!
---
Still makes me sad that labeled him as a Armadillo, Pangolin's are sup much better in every way!
---
There was once a bug where instabilities simply disappeared until it was fixed.
---
EVERYONE (or close) was happy. There was a thread here about the bug, everyone in it was happy. Similar issues (or suggestions) usually meet quite a lot of "omg but it cheeses it, I don't want it to be easy for ppl who don't deserve the loot". But not that time. Fractals without instabilities were just straight better. Well of course, a few days/weeks later once ppl forgot about the joy of doing fractals without instabilities, suggesting to remove them met once again all the "omg don't cheese". But whatever.
---
On that day, Ben (fractal dev) came to the thread and straight out said "don't rejoice, I see you're happy about it but I'm gonna fix this asap" (which he did). Not for a second did it make him realize that maybe instabilities are not fun, that it's a game and that if everyone is having more enjoyment in the game while the bug is active then maybe it's food for thought.
---
Also I wonder if there is some sunken cost fallacy going on : they already spent a lot of dev resources making the system, fixing it several times, reworking it, making new instabs, reworking the system again ... So they prefer spending even more resources on more reworks rather than accept that maybe, Fractals are better without it.
---
I miss the old Chrono because pre stacking is a shit mechanic and shops for in the deepest depth of hell fuck that shit. 
---
The people in anet has no idea how awful it feels to go prestack and get hit by birds keeping you in combat while your group pops the encounter without you regaining cd. Fuck that mechanic. Fuck it.
---
That doesn't make any sense. I mean at all.
---
You can't impersonate a "PvP" because the gold is not sent through a game mode but from another account that is affiliated with a gold seller website. And those accounts are identifiable.
---
There is also no option to "buy gold from the PvP bank".
---
The only way to get gold in game is farming for it or swiping your credit card to buy gems and then transfer it to gold but this is a legit and ingame practice which would also not work. There is always a initiator for a transaction! Always.
---
so since it isn't possible to buy gold with gems for someone else you would have to send them the gold through the mail but there you have two connections if not three.
---
1. The connection between you and the recipient account through the mail
---
2. you buying the gold through gems
---
3. your authorized transaction through the checkout process
---
which means, you could do that all day and they never would get banned, not even you because it is a legit transaction. However, if you, by any chance, would have a stolen credit card or anything even the account you buy this gold from is more likely to get banned than someone else.
---
What crazy mind gymnastics did you do to come up with this?
---
&gt; You've resorted to the ad hominem logical fallacy and attacking character and person rather than answering an argument with an argument
---
It's not an "attack" when you don't understand things...
---
&gt;especially with such things as "Thats ridiculous in a very sad way, because it shows that you don't even know the idea of freedom itself." which also makes no contextual sense given in any facet of this exchange.
---
The sentence was related to your unfriendly "please" to me to leave the whole subreddit, because you don't like what I write. And those (yours) statements *are* ridiculous in a very sad way, because it absolutely ignores the whole general idea of freedom. 
---
&gt;If you think I'm bullying you for simply asking that you use the force of argument, not the argument of force to push your agenda, 
---
I used the word "bully" (don't forget the quotes) in the same context as before, as an answer to your ridiculous demand that I leave the GW2 subreddit.
---
&gt;Why are you even here in the subreddit anymore?
---
Stop twisting tongues, learn to understand things...
---
Good luck identifying the likes of me.
---
ESO you pay with in game gold to expand bag slots, FFXIV has a fully customizable interface 
---
So, basically, make fractals set in stone, so they could be farmed in a coma, after the best solution is found? No, thanks.  
---
"Pvp bank" wasn't one of those webs spamming ad whispers on LA? (I'm a little disconnected from the game lately) 
---
It shows to everyone tho, and everyone else can change it.
---
What I think they mean is sorta like (Focus Targeting system from WoW)[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Focus_target]
---
I don't know, the last time I got whispered with something like that was like 3 years ago in the PvP lobby.
---
But now that you mention it, it does sound familiar. Though I mainly ignored, reported and blocked them quickly.
---
Fair point, that is something that could be done, but I would rather have some new challenge than nothing at all. 
---
In a perfect world, i agree that challenge mode instances could be something to play off, but seeing how well hearts and minds did with that idea, i am not sure how well those could be handled.
---
Deadeye :)
---
Note that with the right build, all classes are extremely powerful, can survive well, and do excellent damage.  This is assuming you're playing solo.  If you're doing raids and doing meta groups, well of course, you want to pick meta instead.
---
Anyway, going back to deadeye, it's different and still a lot of fun and doesn't require lots of muscle memory.  
---
Rifle can be excellent if used right (build is very important).  P/P is okay too.  The biggest issues is taking out multiple groups at once as efficiently as some other builds...but you can always use sword/pistol if needed.  
---
Anyway, might give it a try. :)
---
&gt;Let's call it what it is: toxicity like this is never about "trying to improve a person who's bad". It's about venting one's own frustrations, and building up one's own ego, at the expense of someone else. It's very easy to be a keyboard elitist sitting here telling someone else that they're "being a victim", but it's a lot harder to put on your big boy pants and actually attempt to guide someone positively.
---
It's very easy to sit there and go "you must treat people nicely no matter what they do!". 
---
Crying about toxicity and elitism isn't about being new at the game. It's about a special snowflake attitude of players who refuse to learn or improve. Yet you need to treat them as if they're awesome because not doing so would fracture their fail ego's. They demand to get to join whatever groups they like, and they must treat them amazingly, at the expense of everyone they're playing with. It's very easy to be a special snowflake, sitting here telling everyone else they're just not nice enough towards you. It's a lot harder to actually put on your big boy pants and just MAKE YOUR OWN GROUPS. 
---
Personally, toxicity is one of the best tools you have to keep a certain type of players away. It's unfortunate that just telling them "hey, I don't want to play your style" doesn't work anymore. In raids you shouldn't be toxic, you should just kick. Done. 
---
In WvW you can "nicely" ask players to reroll / do something else / go follow another group / go roam all day. They won't. Especially if you ask nicely. They'll just ignore you and do what they want. If you want to get rid of them, you're much better off being as toxic as possible without crossing the lines of verbal abuse. Make them understand playing with them is not enjoyable. 
---
This wasn't needed a few years ago, when groups and guilds with their own playstyles were respected more often. Nowadays everyone is entitled to join whatever group they decide even if it's clear they shouldn't. Fake LI promoted. They can't stop you from following them in WvW! 
---
Then people are suprised those groups don't treat them nicely. Gee I wonder why. 
---
&gt; click on their character model
---
I find this incredibly difficult in GW2. It wasn't a problem in GW1 though.
---
The Silverwastes is also the test area for level 80 boosted characters. The boosts don't truly activate until you leave the zone so you can romp around the Silverwastes then decide you don't want to use it and change your mind. 
---
The maze is fun and engaging gameplay and totally not a boring time gate intended to stretch out the fractal.
---
If you don't match what the group wants, there is issue. I've had so many people join who pretended to be much better than they are, then proceed to hold back the entire group before getting kicked and raging at the commander.
---
However much people think that it's not obvious they lack experience, it is extremely obvious. It just wastes everyone's time having to either carry someone or kick them.
---
There are different goals for different groups. Some want to 'just kill the boss'. Training runs are a good fit for that, or training discords. Many want to one shot the bosses and not waste time on wiping a lot, which is what happens when new players join experienced groups.
---
I'll roll with a Guild Wars 2: Heroic Edition, please ! :3
---
I've been using this for a week now, and it's great. I experienced around 190% increase in minfps and 25-30% increase in maxfps with gtx1070 on max settings. WvW zergfights are a breeze now, although you have to limit character models otherwise you can experience temporary freezes (for like 0,5 sec but still.) I also got it to work with arcdps with the chainload instructions so that's cool too.
---
But for whatever reason I can't seem to get the character portraits to show up properly. Either someones hair is gone, or only their eyeballs are showing etc. Did clean install, updated drivers, nothing worked there. But this is a small glitch which I can live with. I would appreciate any help on this regard. 
---
Thanks for your hard work, this doesn't go unappreciated.
---
Yep i aggree with you, but optimization doesnt bring money like the Gem Store shinnies, so why put a affort on that xD
---
Do you have a question? This is a question thread.
---
Thanks! If you experienced freezes after leaving zerg area, that problem is being worked on.
---
Sadly, but character portraits will be bugged, still no way to fix this.
---
Do you know all the mechanics of the raids? If not, you should join some training raids. They're great for new players. Most pugs on the lfg have an expectation that you know the raid fairly well already.
---

I have mostly tried guardian and thief. On the guardian I really enjoyed the two handed sword. I loved the high damage output it had. I honestly also just enjoy the glamor of being a dual wielding or two handed weapon bad ass. I find these types of play styles very cosmetically and thematically appealing. I also really enjoy spell casting on my guardian even though it feels very weak. I a
---
Thief I also loved the high damage out put but I felt to squishy and sometimes struggle with closing distance due to this squishiness. 
---
I was thinking about trying ranger next since I enjoyed the ranged game play on my guardian. I have mostly played ranged heroes in mmos in the past and am starting to think I am better at those because I understand kiting but often in melee I feel lost.
---
Griffy :)
---
in Wattman, make your max frequency also your min. my Vega will sometimes downclock significantly while playing GW2, making FPS jump all over the place.
---
I'm a bit bored atm, so I may be able to explain, what you don't get the whole time. 
---
First-&gt; discussion about how mordremoth looks etc. easy thing. 
---
Then I mentioned that you only talking about your *own opinion*
---
Your answer: 
---
&gt;That was my point from the beginning. It was always subjective,
---
I said: 
---
&gt;No you never mentioned that
---
Plus several examples which shows, that you never talked about a subjective view. You always brought your arguments/opinions in form of a fact. like "that's the case, end of discussion" and never like "for me this isn't so..." or simply "imo...".
---
Your answer:
---
First, unedited comment, last sentence. " That's why **I think** people took issue with it"
---
And that's where the problem began. 
---
At this point, you said that you mentioned that you talked about your own opinion from the begin **and** brought that qoute as an argument *"That's why I think people took issue with it"*
---
**But**! your opinion here is *not* related to any of your statements. It's related to the reason why people don't like mordremoth. 
---
Let's take your whole comment, to make it clearer. 
---
&gt;All of the other dragons have draconic physical forms. They hold true to the idea of Elder Dragons. Mordremoth is comparative for power in his own sphere of magic and nature, but lacks the form that literally every other one has. That's why I think so many people took issue with it.
---
&gt;All of the other dragons have draconic physical forms.
---
Wrote as an fact. *"this is so, I say that"*
---
&gt;They hold true to the idea of Elder Dragons.
---
Another fact.
---
&gt;Mordremoth is comparative for power in his own sphere of magic and nature, but lacks the form that literally every other one has.
---
And the third fact.
---
&gt;That's why I think so many people took issue with it.
---
You actual *opinion*, which takes the former facts as arguments to explain why people took issue with it. 
---
-&gt; your "I think"/your opinion is related to the reason why people took issue with it, but **not** to the arguments, the facts you used. 
---
Further I used my "city example" to explain your "fault". 
---
&gt;"Driving car in a city is always slow, because it's so full. That's why I think people don't like driving car in a city. 
---
It's the same as in your text. 
---
&gt;Driving car in a city is always slow, because it's so full. 
---
That's the fact. 
---
Later you complained about so much details of this point. Remember that "only" the following sentences is based on this fact, the fact don't necessarily have to be true neither to be an objective statement; neither all details have to be explained. 
---
Compare it with *your* first fact.
---
It's actually your opinion, but here it's used as a fact, a certain thing which your pronounced opinion ("i think...") is based on. 
---
&gt;That's why I think people don't like driving car in a city. 
---
That's my opinion, which based on the former fact/statement "traffic in cities are slow...".
---
Both quotes have "facts" - we should better call them "statements", because they can be wrong or even opinions - however, these "facts"/statements are expressed like facts. Certain, objective things. 
---
And we have the opinion, which uses the "facts" as agruments to confirm or strengthen the opinion. 
---
So what's the result of all this? Your "I think", your opinion is about the reason why people took issue with Mordremoth and uses your statements/"facts" as arguments. 
---
But it's not about your statements/"facts". 
---
So your sentence "*That's why I think people took issue with it*" is *no* expression that your statements/"facts" are only your own opinion too. 
---
These are written as facts and you never mentioned that it's only your own opinion.
---
&gt; I've had so many people join who pretended to be much better than they are, then proceed to hold back the entire group before getting kicked and raging at the commander.
---
Indeed. But then again, some, or even many people join faking it, and doing crap, does not mean every one of them will do. We also have to take into account people who give their KPs for the guild hall (my GM).
---
&gt; However much people think that it's not obvious they lack experience, it is extremely obvious. It just wastes everyone's time having to either carry someone or kick them.
---
What about when it isn't ? Can you guarantee no pick up your group has used faked his requirements, yet passed the wings with no apparent issue ?
---
&gt; here are different goals for different groups. Some want to 'just kill the boss'. Training runs are a good fit for that, or training discords. Many want to one shot the bosses and not waste time on wiping a lot, which is what happens when new players join experienced groups.
---
Yes, that was my meaning too. I've passed the pleasure of wiping on Gorseval, I'd rather complete a few wings in the evening.
---
So, in which system you integrate it then? Just as a fractal? Minidungeon?
---
How often would you reward it? How well would the reward be? 
---
I get where you come from, especially since dungeons got abandoned the game could use more 5 man content. But i still doubt it would be as easy to integrate as it seems.
---
Thief -&gt; Deadeye. The damage output are insane, plus you got access to stealth, blinds and enough evades to survive most encounters. It is very squishy if you get caught or mess up, but that’s what I love about the class. 
---
For many people, there isn't a lot of fun in hoarding achievements and ingame "stuff". The fun is playing the game with friends, and eventually any piece of content or gameplay system gets stale.
---
Do you have the thread it was discussed to death on? 
---
By this logic I   could buy gold for myself from PvP Bank then just claim I wasn't the one who paid for it. Claim somebody else must have broken the ToS and sent it to me for whatever reason.
---
Which is another reason why mmo's require a certain large playerbase. If they don't maintain this then they go downhill very quickly. 
---
Especially for a game like GW2. Scaleup when the game does well is trivially easy. Making extra instances and even WvW servers costs very little. 
---
But scaling down as population is similarly a downward spiral with quickly diminishing content releases, and thus income, and thus content release, ... 
---
Obviously the game will keep "running", but if it'll continue to be updated? That's another question. 
---
I like you, you remind me of fun
---
Sorry I was trying to reply to a comment  from a previous thread and accidentally posted a new one. I’m really not good at multitasking lol
---
Could you draw a picture of your 3 hands on the keyboard?
---
Which is exactly why we'll never have it. 
---
Wouldn't want you to be mean to players running a mix of soldiers and valkery on their staff necro in T4 fractals. 
---
You're making a good argument, and I mostly agree with you. However, I would like to raise two points:
---
1. Instabilities will not solve the autopilot issue in the long run. Just like people "solve" raid bosses they'll figure out ways to ignore instabilities. Actually the majority of the instabilities can be ignored already, especially the more passive ones like Frailty. This is probably fine, though. Randomness isn't a replacement for new content and their intent likely is to keep fractals fun for a longer time. Which brings me to
---
2. Fun. The problem I have with Slippery Slope isn't that I can't handle it. I learned to handle it on day 1. The problem is I don't find it fun. It's annoying. It is especially annoying on the CMs where positioning actually matters and there are tons of stuff flying toward my face that can kill me. Changing my build to less-optimal is a hassle and besides it wouldn't change the overall experience - even if I can facetank all the stuff (doubtful, since giant space one-shot lasers), my teammates won't. And even if I can handle mechanics on my own, it would take so much time it would kill all my desire to do so.  
---
I get what you're saying. But I still think some of the instabilities need to go in their current state, or at the very least get blacklisted on specific fractals where they end up creating frustrating situations. I don't have a problem with Birds either, but I do think it's short-sighted to leave them as a valid instability on Aetherblade. Sure, it's just one room that's a potential problem, but can become extremely annoying if not all players have good execution. 
---
In a way, these instabilities (or rather instability/fractal combinations) have very little effect on statics with proficient players, but tend to hinder PUG groups a lot. I think that's a bad direction. I spend considerably more time on LFG recently and I can see the situation only getting worse as the things are currently.
---
There was a sincere moment of panic when I hit the wrong button 😱
---
Love it! 🙃
---
So Braham just left his cubs alone at home?
---
In open world PvE anything is fine and Holosmith is a fun profession to play, IMO.
---
In raids holo is not the highest dps class, but it is accepted in pretty much every encounter where power-DPS is favored. It has good utility and good damage output.
---
Is it hard? Well, I learned holo after staff weaver got nerfed and I needed a new power class - and it was definitely harder than weaver. Not sure if that's helpful.
---
Since I haven't played PvP for two or three seasons I won't comment on that. Back then it was fairly strong though.
---
That's not fair. Maybe both will die at the same time!
---
ESDF
---
How do you plan on playing efficiently without using the mouse?
---
&gt; So here's your reason, which I'll double down : fuck gear check. I don't care about your requirements if I feel I can do it, and I'll come in anyway. 
---
Keep it up! I'm sure this will lower the LI requirements. It certainly won't fuel more toxicity.
---
Thanks for helping the cause tho :)
---
I have always felt a weird kinship with AUX since my groups always runs into them during guild missions. They're so kind as to kill the mobs during the race so everyone else can make it through. What a great bunch of folks!

If I didn't dress my charrs in ridiculous outfits I'd want to be a part of em, they're awesome! :P

1. There are 100 [fractal](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractals_of_the_Mists) levels split into 4 tiers with 99 and 100 having optional challenge versions that are harder. Fractals are no longer in sets and instead are single runs with guaranteed location (path changes on some). Agony is still a thing and you can see how much is recommended for each, it goes up to a max of 150. Lots of mechanics and difficulty is added as you go up in fractal level, mobs get stronger (mainly vitality scaling) and more [mistlock instabilities](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractals_of_the_Mists#Mistlock_Instability) get added (random and they change). Daily rewards are mainly from the [daily fractals](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractals_of_the_Mists#Daily_Fractals) as well as the recommended fractals. They are separated into tiers for the daily rewards but doing a higher tier gives the lower ones as well.
---
*Will keep editing in other answers*
---
Ranger has a pet, permanently, which often manages aggro for you. Because the pet does a portion of your DPS, it can feel a little weak at range. I found it fun to level but almost never play it nowadays, except on the rare occasions I need to use it as a druid. Their greatsword skills are pretty strong, so you might like that. 
---
Mesmers use greatswords as a ranged attack (it's like a magical focus, the sword literally floats in front of you shooting lasers sometimes) and can use illusions to keep out of harm's way, so that might fit your playstyle. 
---
Rebind the skills to be closer to your movement keys. Rebinding the movement keys from WASD to ESDF is also relaively popular because it gives you a wider range of keys on both sides to bind to skills. Don't use the cursor keys for movement. It will just make things awkward and much harder than it needs to be.
---
Thank you. :)
---
Q1: Do the dailies (purple blob) for the appropriate tier for your AR and possibly your recommended one. You level up your personal fractal level by doing any fractal higher than your fractal level. So, if your fractal level is 23, anything higher than that will raise your fractal level. You still need to aim for 150AR for the top end. 
---
Q2: If you're pure power damage, then power/precision/ferocity (Berserker's), maybe with something like Assassin's gear to increase your crit rate will maximise damage. If you need more survivability, buffing ability, condition damage etc, you'll want to mix it up. It's often recommended as meta gear for raids and fractals, because it assumes you'll have a boon support and a dedicated healer, so you can get away with the fact that you have paper-thin survivability. Condition damage builds often aim for Viper's gear. Berserker's is still decent for glass-cannon power DPS builds, but condi and support builds will need more variety. 
---
Q3: Karma becomes useful again in Living World maps. The Orr maps have vendors that sell exotic gear (e.g. berserker's) for karma. The karma-gold exchange rate isn't great, so just hoard it for now.
---
Q4: Silverwastes is alive and kicking, as is Dry Top. World boss trains still happen daily. 
---
Q5: S2 has a decent story but no super-duper rewards. S3 (requires HoT) has new maps and easy to get map rewards (ascended trinkets, mostly). S4 (requires PoF) has varied rewards, including a new mount and very lucrative meta events. They do go on sale periodically. 
---
Q6: They're mostly used in crafting legendary or ascended gear (dragonite ingots etc, right?). Hoard them and don't worry about deleting things like extra bloodstone dust - if you're overflowing then it's easy to obtain more. 
---
I wonder what that ink was laced with
---
Thank you for giving away those keys. I would like to be added to the pool for a Guild Wars 2: Heroic Edition.

I enjoy new instabilities, all the fractal players must do is to accept and learn to adapt to something new. I am glad they treat us all as someone clever enaugh to deal with any problem, rather than reworking fractals to a level of dungeons where everything is given to you with no sense of logic and makes brain lazy. I love new instabilities and I hope they will not change anything about them.

What's the state of WvWvW on NA these days?

I am not rightly able to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that would provoke someone to ask such a question about an mmo. Did you think this was a single player game? 
---
Marketing.
---
Fair points, if i may try, I'd like to adress them to the best of my ability.
---
1. Yes, they will not solve the issue on their own. However, i would argue that simply by having sugar rush (my favorite of the new ones), any fractal changes significantly, since your rotation, all timings as well as the threat by adds is completely different. So by changing instabilities, if, and only if, done well, they can extend the fractals they have until they have new content ready to roll. I would agree that in a perfect world, new content were better, but we live with what we get.
---
2. While fun varies from person to person, the point that slope is perhaps a bit too frustrating on certain occasions is definetely valid. However, i would still argue that it is a challenge that can be valuable to master (and be satisfying to perform) in the long run, just like learning how to master the orbjump was. 
---
Also, the idea was not to facetank things (that's exactly what i wanted to avoid) but run something that allows you to not facetank things (you probably know mobility/endurance options of your class far better than i do).
---
As far as pugging goes, maybe i am too optimistic, but people can learn. 
---
Personal experience only, but if you give a group the time to properly learn a fight, they will perform well on it afterwards (in my case it was the crow encounter, one group performed really well after struggling for 30 mins for example).
---
As far as the situation getting worse: in the short term i agree it most likely will, but once people allow "lesser" standards (for example condi dps) i am sure it will improve.
---
&gt;I cringed so hard whenever friends/guildies/etc. mocked the pugs after gearchecking them but then got outdps by the very pugs. Anyone exposed to the superiority complex could turn into one of those wannabe elitists unknowingly. I don't like to blame a tool but i don't see a positive benefit from gearchecking.
---
Discord in WvW was rather entertaining in the gearcheck days. The whiny plebs pretty much always turned out to be clueless, badly geared, whiny plebs. Funny how that works. 
---
It doesn't suprise any half decent player that full exotic zerk armor was completely fine almost every time. It also doesn't suprise any half decent player that the "meta" reaper with their secret mix of carrior and rabid did not get anywhere near the "meta" benchmarks.
---
It's even more laughable with how GW2 peddles itself as "being about fashion wars". Terrible armor styles that only fit well on human females (if even then) aside, the mechanics of the fashion system are just asinine. 
---
Good help you if you have a pet. They just run off and attack random shit. Sometimes I can summon one on my Necro, not having anything targeted and not even having anything in aggro range, and they'll just run off into the distance and to talk random mobs soon as I finish summoning.
---
Part of me thinks that they came up with the Soul Beast spec as a Band-Aid for the bad pet AI. After I leveled my Ranger I got so frustrated with it I "kept thinking to myself can I just get rid of this stupid" pet make myself more powerful?" It would also be really nice if I could tell my pet to attack one thing while I'm attacking a different thing. I find it no matter what I tell my pet to attack as soon as I target a different mob, my pet just bounces around my targets. I kind of wanted you to tank that thing while I kill this other thing, guy.
---
I agree with you that people bitch too much about it. But I also disagree to some degree.
---
1. Yes the instabilities are well **designed**. Just think about them and you'll quickly realize that they add a ton of variation.
---
2. The problem is a lot of them doesn't seem to be tested, it's one thing to design a cool mechanic, and another to actually implement it and try that it's fun. Sure the devs can say that cliffside etc was never meant to have slippery slope and all. But something tells me it's just untested because we have things coming through all the time that later end up being "un intended and fixed". Sure it's tinfoil conspiracy. But some things just aren't fun and seem like they didnt get enough testing (if any at all). Testing that the instability works (mechanically) and that it works in real runs with different instabilities at the same time is a whole different thing.

The windows setting is for assigning different graphic cards to different applications. My computer has only one card, so that setting does nothing.
---
I enjoy the instabilities. For sure, they can be improved, and many people make some good points about the problems with the current instabilities. But I enjoy when we get into a fight were we could normally win with the first try, now having to adapt to survive it. I like it when after a few fails, I discuss with my group what we are doing wrong, and we modify our builds for the encounter, and then we succeed. That's the end pve game I want to play. Not the same old thing, with one static build that can encounter everything. It's nice to actually have to stop and think what you should do to complete the task, and not just farm it and move on. I don't want the t4 to be the same thing every time. I want them to be a different experience, otherwise it would get boring fast. I also like the philosophy of being able to use the instabilities to your advantage, if played right. Let's hope they further improve the instabilities to this direction and listen to critique that really wants the instabilities to be fun (and not annoying), but not easy!
---
Karma tastes like karma. A taste you can not describe with other words but karma itself.
---
Mmo mouse with side buttons is also a good idea. Been enjoying it immensly lately. If you cannot afford things like g600 or naga trinity, I recommend the Redragon mice. Been using one for a few months already and it's a huge convenience :) 
---
I played EQ2 around 2005-2006 and it had such a range of graphical options that I'm honestly butthurt about the lack of graphical customization in modern games. 
---
Why was I able to fine tune the magnitude, number of particles, lifetime of the particles, reflections/ambient effects on particles, the number of effects shown for me, my group mates, other friendly players on my screen, friendly NPCs, hostile NPCs, PVP enemies all in separate settings in a game that was released 15 years ago, yet I don't even get one unified number of unique effects to be displayed per player slider in GW2?
---
Wow! That is alot of very helpful info.! Just to make sure I understand correctly. The mist talisman and mist band are one of those item that let you double click and select a stat group right? 
---
Also, you say I need to craft an ascended piece, then change it to Zehtukas piece using an exotic insignia, is there not an ascended insigna for the harrier stats?
---
Thanks again for all your help, after researching and doing all that typing it out for me to read must have seemed like no time at all!
---
This is what I've been struggling with all this time... Is it just its own flavor? Neither sweet nor spicy nor salty nor bitter nor... anything? 
---
Thanks for all the info. I have stumbled on some of it on the wiki, but having it all in one place like that is really helpful. I was surprised how much of it I had forgotten!
---
Most new instas i enjoy. Some have their problems obviously (no need to be specific) but they are not hindering completion that much. And such problems are easily fixable with blacklisting.
---
The problem is that player base is focusing on the wrong issues. It just that these instas came right with the chrono changes that removed a lot of the clutches people had. People lost their ability to run through t4 fractals on autopilot and blamed it on the instas. No amount of blacklisting will change that. People were too much used to steamrolling t4 using established methods and it has been too long since they were challenged. 
---
There are two pet peeves I have generally about fractals. First is their overwhelming desire to lump all the time gated fractals together into one day. Those days where you end up with Furnace/Twilight/Deepstone/Siren's combos are extremely nauseating to go through.  The second is that when you do have a CM as your daily and a short run of fractals, they feel this overwhelming desire to take all the shittiest instabilities and lump them together into one bundle. Today was no joke healing with bleed fire/birds on Mai Trin and Sugar Rush in molten. It feels like A Net is going out of their way deliberately to be jackasses, and I am feeling the burnout of fractals. 
---
So I downloaded the pack and there are no hero point markers :(
---
You still have missed the point.
---
If you buy gold for yourself then you also want to receive that gold. If you buy for someone else you only care for the result in them getting banned.
---
As per the link I posted above (that I don't think you spent any time in reading because all those things are answered there)
---
&gt; If possible, support will try to remove or recover any funds or items sent by an RMT account and collected by the buyer.
---
&gt; If the gold or items are collected from the in-game message, it may be subtracted from the user’s wallet or manually removed by a support agent.
---
Which means that if you bought gold or items for yourself or someone else those items or currency will be removed from your account. Which also means that buying those things for yourself is wasting money because you will have paid for something that will be gone and doesn't matter if you spent it already.
---
Also...
---
&gt; In extreme cases, we may roll back the account to remove any skins, items, or other progress that cannot be manually reset. This measure is only taken in the most extreme circumstances.
---
So not only is what you bought gone but also everything you did in that time between you receiving the item/currency and the detection.
---
And finally...
---
&gt; If the account is directly linked to RMT—by way of evidence that amounts to more than just receiving items—it may be subject to further account action.
---
That is, if they find a direct link. Which means that if you buy something they probably won't find anything that links you directly to a gold seller by you "boasting" about it in chat, asking about it or whatever.
---
Which means that while they can't link you to and RMT they will still take the stuff you bought away which, as already stated in the very first comment would be YOU wasting money.
---
&gt;Give 
---
I downloaded and installed it, lo and behold there are no hero point markers on the PoF maps ...
---
It depends. If you have been good it tastes great. If you have been bad it tastes like ass. That's karma.
---
Thanks for your help, but I do have a question for you. What pieces of gear should be Harrier and what parts Mintrels? Is there a certain number I should be looking for in certain stats? Like at at least 1,000 Healing Power for example.
---
[Here](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) you can see the benchmarks of holosmith and compare them to other classes in PvE. It's not bad.
---
It's very effective in PvP. It has damage, good mobility and utility.
---
It's very effective in roaming WvW, but not as much in massive fighs.
---
Nope you guys getting trolled the is the noble set the one of the left and the lunutic set on the right.
---
I made a longer post about this in another thread, but my main crux with some of these instabilities are in how they break certain encounters and make them unfun to play. Granted in this case, I am the type of player that wants to run 99cm.exe because that is what I view as fun (although part of it is getting there). 
---
When it comes to Slipperly Slope my main criticism of it is how it breaks movement skills that you want to be using. Warrior axe f1 and kick and Weaver sword fire 2 for instance. In my opinion if they made it so that movement skills ignore your momentum and reset it to zero, Slippery Slope would be way less oppressive. 
---
My problem with Birds is that it is poorly telegraphed, so maybe add a 2s warning, that its upside is useless, that the birds turns into enemies is stupid, and that it does not give you more endurance regen (like hamstrung does). I think if you change 2 of these it would be a fine instability. 
---
Last point I want to make is about Social Awkwardness because it exemplifies why I dislike some of these instabilities. SA takes away agency you have over your character and that is terrible design. You can disincentive stacking without removing my control over my character. I think there is nothing worse in fractals then me getting bounced around, however this is mostly because I really dislike when I am not in control of my own character.
---
Lastly at some point I would just quite fractals if I cannot play some form of nuking the bosses because to me that is fun. I consider a fractal interesting if I can do the following steps: engaging and/or hard to learn, allows for optimization, and can be abused in some form or another by damage, breakbars, or positioning. I love the fact that I do not have to dodge at all on Arkk or Skorvald (not including the split adds) because of the way you can change how you play to deal with the fights.
---
Birds are ok, just need a small rework, they just trigger too often, and they seem buggy, because they trigger even after combat ends sometimes. I completely agree with the rest of them. There shouldn't be any instability that completely changes the physics of movement in movement focused game. Some fractals need precise positioning/jumping in order to not die or lose progress. It's not challenging anymore, it's just purely annoying and just kills fun, because players are punished for things they can't really do anything about. Slippery slope is just plain bad and should be deleted. No rework can repair this, it's just a bad idea, which was not tested properly. No one thought that Slippery + Social Awkwardness will turn fractal into painful air hockey as well, I suppose. 
---
Thanks for the giveaway! I'll try my luck with a GW2: Heroic Edition code.
---
It's almost always the starting waypoint from my first experiences
---
And also apply afflicted
---
Alright let me put it this way. Kitless builds are decent DPS that are good to start with so you can get a feel for the class without being overwhelmed trying a new class. They can then try using kits more often once they get an idea on how the class plays. There are a lot of option this class has because of kits and depending on how one wants to play there is most likely an option for that.
---
The core game has always been a joke. You have all just forgotten how easy it was and how much whining it produced back on release.   
---
Heck, it was *moderately* difficult in *some select parts* and those got nerfed into oblivion after open beta. Especially in regards to mobs' AI. Fuck that. GW2 regular/open world combat is the most boring MMORGP combat experience I've seen in my life due to combination of the class system and mob design. The expansions only go so far in fixing that. 
---
Thank you, I will check it out!
---
I use it and I have markers for sure (at least in verdant brink where I just turned them off)
---
As Lulu would say... "Yup! That tasted purple!" 
---
well did you try to backstab the boss from behind?
---
So I say go the stat swapping method as currently, you cannot buy the recipes for zehtukas gear from the master vendors, as far as I know. The mystic forge recipe to swap stats requires exotic gossamer insignias NOT ascended ones.  https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Stat_changing#Ascended
---
For the weapons if I'm not mistaken you will need mordant inscriptions for the swap. 
---
There is an ascended insignia for harriers stats, but the catch here is the recipe for all the parts of zehtukas only drop from EXTREMELY tedious searching for buried treasure in the crystal desert(the map is gigantic and the drop chance is quite low)  or you can be my guest to drop ~800 additional gold on the TP to get the recipes immediately.  
---
Hope this helps, and if you find anything else out let me know! I largely had to figure a bunch out myself as information about this is very threadbare. 
---
I keep doing that too, but I've managed to train a habit of shift-tabbing back to the target I've missed
---
Based on the color, I've always assumed bubblegum or that pink liquid fever reducer my mother used to give me as a kid that in retrospect tasted too good for what it was.  I can imagine kids sneaking it and drinking it like candy and overdosing.
---
Pepto bismol or however you spell it
---
Cannot talk about PvP besides the fact that they do have a few very good build. 
---
They pretty solid on open PvE and as DPS for fractals. It has very high cleve and it is really i important for both. 
---
In raids it has been a bit overshadowed by more powerful easier to play DPS build by it is extremely capable if you take the time to learn the rotation well. Plus it brings good CC and high vulnerability stacking through grenades. 
---
It is definitely not the easiest class to play well. You will need some training especially for fractals and raids. But you get use to it easily. And in open world if you want to not change build all the time and keep your fractal/raid builds on it is a bit of a glass cannon. Meaning very effective but squishy so it will take some time to get used to it.  
---
We need more information.  Not a single game in the history of games will have a rock steady framerate.  GPUs and CPUs process things that are on the screen such as character models, textures, particle effects etc.  If you are standing still looking at a wall, not moving then your framerate should be pretty high and steady.  If you are running around in Open World your framerate will vary based on what is on the map.  If you are zerging around somewhere then everyone starts fighting a mob the number of particle effects is going to sky rocket thus dropping your framerate. 
---
&gt; What I said, "profiting from something", already implies the very definition you copied from google. The goal is profit. And no. No part of that definition is about maximizing profits. Maximizing profits is obviously gonna be the ultimate goal of most companies, but it's not a part of the literal definition of capitalism.
---
This is absolutely nonsensical. Do you think it means "but only profit a little bit"? Seriously?
---
The whole underlying idea is that you maximise profits. Because only that leads to the highest efficiency. Which is the point. You create a product as efficiently as possible. And that means by definition to maximise profits. Or else you loose in the marketplace because others who are more efficient will push you out.
---
&gt; I don't particularly care that they fired 800 people this week. But every single fucking release by these AAA developers are met with "below expectations from shareholders".
---
No, it isn't. Maybe read up on these things first? Don't just claim random bullshit you made up 5 minutes ago.
---
You cannot dye gliders or backpacks 
---
Yeah, make it a habit to check once in a while ^^ 
---
Sadly no, no backpack or glider is dyeable but if you like the pallet it still looks awesome imo and personally most of my characters have white/bluish/light purple armors so this glider or backpack fit most of them perfectly.
---
Different OS, different executable files :D
---
Well smthing like that anyway
---
&gt; But the toxic one is always wrong, that's not negotiable. 
---
Interesting. So your behavior is fine because it suits you, and cannot be prevented anyways. Haha! Yet if people are toxic, they're always wrong and this is non-negotiable. 
---
And somehow, I get the feeling that you don't consider your own behavior toxic. 
---
No, I wouldn't want to nerf the raids currently. I think they are, generally, at a good place. Sure there are exceptions like Largos Twin which probably need tweaked a bit so that more than one profession is good but generally both the normal and CM difficulties are fine.
---
However, the resources used for raiding currently aren't accessible to the majority of players and for people that want a challenge that isn't present. So I'd like to see an easier match made difficulty like I mentioned, the retention of our current difficulty and then maybe monthly repeatable CMs (for slightly less rewards than the first time).
---
I really like Guild Wars 2 for raiding but I feel it is a little mismanaged in terms of appealing to a broader audience and I feel that if Anet would focus on that then it would lead to a healthier game mode and better player retention. 
---
It's not anything, just karma. 
---
Not from other MMOs but balance patches every month for pvp and wvw. This is something that actual competitive games do. They shake up the meta every month. Not once a year like GW2 and most other MMOs.
---
The amount of carebears in this game is abhorrent.  Calling someone "bad" or telling them to "uninstall the game" is 100% not harassment or overly negative behavior.  Holy hell, you people need to actually learn to shrug some things off in your life.  "WAH, Mommy!  The mean man called me bad and told me to uninstall."  It's sad. 
---
I wish Twilight Oasis was only the boss fight. Or it had a CM like that.
---
Ugh, I'd never consume karma again if that was the case.
---
So basically as a dragons stand daily? That could work. 
---
Now i don't know how much data they would have to shift around, but if you make those as an alternative to dragons stand, why not.
---
You mean you don't like wiping more on Mai Trin (with we bleed fire, birds, AND flux bombs AND the entire arena being covered in AOE) than you do on 99CM and 100CM combined?
---
It's seriously ridiculous when the regular T4's are the ones that people rage quit nowadays. Something needs to be done. I love fractals, played them almost daily for 2 years (Fractal Champ, almost God!) because they were fun with a small challenge. But now, they are so damned long and difficult a lot of the fun is gone. I consider myself above-average fractaler, and feel bad for all the people with less skill and gear. I always compare the new fractals (after SO) to the old ones as a base line - even doing the T1 recs, the new fractal bosses can take minutes to tear through (even looking at you, Elite Sandbinders...), when even on the old/fun fractals, you can burn Siax before he's even done channeling his first spell!

He may not have done any for PoF yet (they are pretty easy) you could always follow a guide (like [this one](https://hash-co.de/gw2/hp/) or [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/72zceh/gw2_pof_26_hphearo_point_run_guid/).

Mistlock Instability: Slippery Slope
---
I... I need a griffon
---
Thanks for the reply! One other thing I realized is catapult stones not showing mid air, but this does not always happen. 
---
 &gt; no backpack or glider is dyeable 
---
Are you trying to say the Crystalline Dragon Wings glider isn't dyeable (correct, it is not dyeable), or that *no* glider is dyeable (incorrect, I have several that are dyeable)?
---
For clarity's sake.
---
Well, some smart man once said the only thing comparable to the size of the universe was human stupidity, but given what i personally have experienced, if you give people a chance to learn, most will take it.
---
So yeah, it is possible the fractal scene selfdestructs like the raid scene is doing currently, but i honestly have more hope due to the daily incentive/ lower time consumed, so you can tolerate some mistakes.
---

---
&gt; The backpack got rotated 90 degrees, so it clips thru the skritt and the cage just kind of sticks to the side.
---
Best class. Go for it.
---
At least the game spares you from some of the horror: you just don't fit into most of the jumping puzzles. 
---
Not quite a Dragon's Stand daily since it obviously wouldn't be the full meta but it allows for currently under utilised content to be used for a more repeatable and engaging purpose with very little modification. It also provides an alternative avenue for currency acquisition with the second suggestion and it could end up appealing to the sort of player that doesn't want to farm nodes or run multiple DS in a row to get crystalline ore or whatever. Choices in content completion for a particular reward are never a bad thing after all. 
---
If it depends on a definition, then by all means provide whatever definition you feel good with.
---
But so far I get the impression that you consider your behavior entirely acceptable. Yet you also state (verbal) toxicity is always wrong, and this is non-negotiable.
---
Completely agree with you. The CMs are my favorite fractals to play because they feel fair (unless frailty and we bleed fire are stacked or some bs). When I die in those, I usually know why. There's also little time wasted on trash mobs or trivial puzzles.
---
All of the newer fractals are the complete opposite of this: Twilight Oasis, Molten Boss, Deepstone, Siren's Reef.  
---
Chock-full of trash mobs, tons of wasted time with dialog or trivial shit, bad mechanics.
---
I really wonder what happened after the CM releases in the fractal design team. Do we have any info on that? Did the fractal lead dev leave or something like that?
---
they really need to rethink the whole living world idea, it just isn't working out at the moment. a couple of hours of content every 3 + months is not enough, it would be better to just drop it altogether and focus on expansions, most people don't buy living world but get it for free so expansions would be a good source of income for them. i know they make their money from the gemstore but it would be a lot better if you pay for an expansion and in that expansion you could actually earn gear rather than just buying an outfit on the store.
---
Im slowly getting used to them. At first some were pretty hard, you learn to counter play them. I feel groups that wimp out on a certain instability are probably groups i didnt want to play with anyway. Its rough being double the highest next dps. Pug problems.
---
*tin foil hat* I think they are intentionally trying to drive people out just like they did with dungeons.
---
Yeah, to be fair, real d5s look really weird. Modelling one doesn't look easy.
---
triggered
---
If you just try to headbutt them, while lacking a proper skill to do so, maybe. 
---
remove current trait lines for every class
---
make ascended helms, shoulders, and chests randomly have 2 major and minor traits
---
And don't even get me started on those Exalted Explosives.
---
No wonder South is always holding everyone up. 
---
Yeah, d8 sides are triangles, d10 sides are kites. It looks weird because the side away from the camera is too large relative to the visible sides.
---
It doesn't seem surprising that the game mode with the highest gearing requirements displays rigidity in regards to team compositions.
---
When you present players with a choice of, "Hey, go make another gearset so you can play on a character you're not experienced with to adapt to this tacked on gimmick that's only relevant for today and prepare your butt to "adapt" like this again tomorrow" or "Fuck all that, let's just try and push our way through as best we can" it's not surprising players choose the latter.
---
At the end of the day most people just want to play with their friends and they probably don't have a menagerie of T4 ready alts that they know how to play. This kind of loosy-goosy jUsT aDaPt YoUr CoMp EvErY dAy shit would be relatively more acceptable in game modes that don't require full Ascended and 150 AR worth of infusions on any character you want to use for T4s. And I say this as someone who, personally, has 9 legendary weapons, a set of legendary armour for each weight class and an unlimited extractor. So, for me, adjusting and adapting is just a matter of time and how much effort I'm willing to expend swapping shit around. The average player though, is not going to these kinds of resources available so it's unrealistic and unreasonable to expect them to bring the kind of adaptability to the table that you or I might be able to.
---
It’s Calpol. Confirmed by devs.
---
1st: I would have to test this, but from my experience (engeneer) you can change your position in such a way that they still hit. If it is impossible to do for some skills, then i apologize.
---
2nd: Birds work as follows from my experience: 
---
1. you get the debuff
---
2. if you dodge while targets are nearby, they get the debuff
---
3. after while, their debuff expires and birds spawn, or if nothing got the debuff, they spawn immediately.
---
And ye, you are still killing them, just 0.5 seconds after you would have normally killed them. Difference is, they are not hitting you in the meantime.
---
3rd ye i meant sugar rush. As far as adds on skorvald go, stand your ground works wonders around that (just one example).
---

---
Yes you need to install it but if you have older files you can copy them into the install directory so that you don't need to download all of the files.
---
Yeah. 
---
What I mean with "Custom outfit slots" would just save armor appearance, allowing you to switch between them like you can with outfits, then dye the selection in the dye panel. 
---
But "Appearance loadouts" would save everything. Armor and weapon skinss, dyes, outfit, mini, finishers, mail carrier, glider, mouts, novelties, extra visuals like auras, etc. When a loadout is selected, it'll set or override the appearance of the currently selected items, more like with the SWTOR outfit designer. 
---
They use an even more extreme method in Champions Online and Star Trek Online. Stats are in items with no appearance, and appearance is freely chosen in a designer panel.

As a necro, I can say that nothing is more frustrating than flying away from the battlefield jollily on your scythe with Death's Charge x.x It is almost comic at times.
---
Because we do dailies and drink that up whenever we get it, I'm assuming it's very tasty.
---
Because I have never personally received a Salvaged Excellence from an LS amulet, and until this post, had not heard of anyone else doing so either.
---
You get a lot more 'Casual Toxicity' in GW2 than you get Elitist Toxicity. 
---
&gt; They keep saying that they are using the skills and they just miss. I have never experienced this myself, but I play power Soulbeast and Dragonhunter.
---
Soulbeast is completely ruined by Slippery Slope, they depend a lot on skills to dodge.  Sword 2, Sword 3, GS 3 are all intended to give soulbeast mobility and evade.  Slippery slope basically disables them, which means after your dodges are gone your option for fights is pretty much to stand still and hope your healer outheals the damage.
---
Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, 'enemy' counts yellow and red as the same priority. 
---
Install Arc DPS and actually measure your performance - and the people you group with.   
---
Worst case it will remove the guesswork and make you a better player  
---
Best case it will validate to you personally that people are just salty, and make you a better player.
---
&gt; If it depends on a definition, then by all means provide whatever definition you feel good with.
---
But a definition "I feel good with" it not an agreed definition, and thus renders the discussion pointless, as much as when people fight on what geek or liberal means.
---
&gt; But so far I get the impression that you consider your behavior entirely acceptable.
---
If by my behavior, you mean going into groups while not respecting the LFG requirements, I'm indeed fine with it, as long as I perform. If I don't, I remove myself.
---
I think this is a far better deal than waiting to stack 250 LI to be able to PU Sabetha while having killed her under 10 LI the first time.
---
Is this toxicity to you ? Then yes, I'm toxic. Is it toxicity only when people do the same thing with the same arguments, while not being able to perform, and making the group waste his time ? Then I'm not.
---
&gt; Yet you also state (verbal) toxicity is always wrong, and this is non-negotiable.
---
Calling names and asking to uninstall, among other things, are indeed unacceptable, whether it comes from the recruiting group or from people that come in. I know it won't ever stop, because humans are what they are. But the moment you start doing that, you're in the wrong (and might just join the other side that was in the wrong too first).
---
That was meant in the least creepy way possible!
---
Regards, your average internet gay guy
---
I must say I have do not normally use those skills, so I have not experienced the fact that they are broken, however it would not surprise me if they are. Thanks for the heads up.
---
No worries I read it that way hahaha 
---
&gt; At Q2 you mention support builds. Are those viable now?
---
For raids and higher tier fractals, two or three support builds are pretty much mandatory. For open world stuff, you still need a decent level of DPS.
---
If dices are the way they are on pic. You can make "beneficial" throw that has more cgance to land one of 4 sides that are rolling. Makeing 1 opposite to 6 and 2 to 5 makes it mor risky to throw dice certain way.
---
It's one thing for players to  just go in wanting to be carried through content, it's another to act like the meta is the *only* way to play that content. There are plenty of people that can complete T4 Fractals and Raids on non-meta builds..... the modes were designed that way for a reason. The problem is when players expect other players to only play those modes the way they think it should be played.
---
It is within your right to want to play those quickly if you so choose, but many players like just playing through the content. I don't have time to go and grind for the BIS gear for meta builds,  so I just haven't played Raids at all because it seems that unless your in a guild that just wants to have fun, finding players to play Raid and T4 is damn near impossible..... and ultimately (due to how perception works) it's ArenaNet that takes the blame for that (which is sad because there's literally nothing they can do about it.... players will find a way).
---
Lmao, I really don't know slot about mmorpgs
---
Yeah, AUX does a *lot* of guild missions.
---
I just don't get the point of a d5. It's not a regular shape, you have to trust a manufacturer that they actually made a fair one, and there already exists a d10 which you could easily use same way you would roll a d3 from a d6.
---
Purple flavored 
---
Thank you for the info :)
---
You can check if they're dyeable , either on the wiki , or hit H and go to glider skins, and click them. It will preview them, and also it will say if they are able to be dyed.
---
This is a really good idea. I loooove my salvage-o-matic. I could never go back to kits. 
---
Still, your comment made me chuckle a little. :)
---
 "Ugh! Trash!" *Thinks of Zecel*  :( 
---
I totally agree. Today i was doing fractals with pugs and we stuck with mai trin thanks to mistlocks (slippery, social, we bleed fire) and it was no fun.
---
Crystalline dragon wings cannot be dyed - can’t dye the glider or the back item
---
Yeah I've got like a thousand tomes I main wvw. I just mean if I had to grind level one today without eotm i would be lost as to what to do that isn't braindead boring.
---
Thanks! I would love some GW2 Heroic Edition Code ;D
---
I would suggest getting your crafting to 500 as there is daily crafting cooldowns, however, you can (very expensively) skip this step. This is for ascended gear, so if you aren't adamant about that at the moment, you're losing out on nothing.
---
Outside of that, there is no cooldowns on crafting. You can start with 0 materials for a legendary weapon, buy all the materials, and craft it in 15 minutes. 
---
Even if you want to craft ascended gear from scratch and don't want to focus on it right now, it will always be best in slot, and since there is no treadmill, there is no rush to get it!
---
You get loot that is around your level and the materials around level 50 are worth more, you can see the breakdown on that linked site.
---
But I don't care about any skins. Getting a wardrobe unlock is disappointing in general.
---
Which build is Magu scourge? Snow Crows do not seem to know it.
---
For acended armor and weapons there are time gated mats that you can make one per day. They can be bought on the trading post thought. I beleive tailor is the worst with time hates as it requires 33 of the same mat for a full set but I could be wrong.
---
As far as legendaries is really depends. Some you can craft to precursor and you should work on that mastery if that is the route you want to go to. Others, like the pvp back peice, have an achievement requirement that is time gated.
---
If you have more specific goals we would be happy to help.
---
This also is assuming you are 80, if not you have time before this comes relevant.
---
I wanted to give Fractals a try last night and when I looked up beginner advise it was usually just “grab exotic gear and go for it” so I did...and I wound up in one with a 35 Agony rating. Not sure if I messed up, or the leader messed up the advertising. Pretty sure I was searching in T1, but just Incase is there anything I should look out for when joining through LFG? Should I just stick to the T1 dailies? Is there another way to join groups if you’re not it a Guild?
---
Also, how do I unlock more? Just joining other groups? When I join, can I join from anywhere in the world? Or do I have to be near the portal to get the option to teleport?
---
I do want to give them a try because they seem fun, but mostly I’m interested in finally getting into Fashion Wars. Are Fractals a good place to get some of the more shiner gear? Everything I’ve found just in Open World doesn’t seem that special... at least compared to all the floaty and glowy stuff I’ve seen other people wearing. 
---
&gt; I think this is a far better deal than waiting to stack 250 LI to be able to PU Sabetha while having killed her under 10 LI the first time.
---
Nobody ever said you needed 250 li to be able to kill sab. I killed sab when I was at 2 li (VG and gorse). But having killed sab under 10 li the first time doesn't make you experienced, much less comfortable on the boss. Frankly it's quite meaningless. 
---
&gt; If by my behavior, you mean going into groups while not respecting the LFG requirements, I'm indeed fine with it, as long as I perform. If I don't, I remove myself. 
---
So you get to judge your own performance and decide if it's adequate or not. Something which frankly, most users cannot do. If they don't know the boss well, how could they even? They have limited information. Yet you consider it perfectly fine. You can lie to other players and that's acceptable because you know better! How dare they set requirements?! 
---
But if they call you out? Then they're toxic and unacceptable. 
---
I don't mind if you call it toxic or not. I know without a doubt that it leads to frustration among some players. Maybe you are the magical user that has 10 li yet doesn't fuck up significantly. But in my experience all the lying and cheating only leads to more toxicity. 
---
Keep in mind i'm not against this. I'm wholeheartedly in favour of more toxicity in GW2. Not because I think it's nice for anyone - but because it's required for some minorities to be able to play the way they enjoy. And as a result, it's a logical result of your actions. That's why "toxicity" and "elitism" has been getting progressively worse and spreading to fractals, wvw and so forth. 
---
How is someone who notices that you're playing badly supposed to react? Teach you in a high li run? That's condescending at best and already considered toxic, and not desired by most of the actually experienced players. Not call you out? That'll annoy the others that notice. Call you out? Suddenly it's toxic and that means they're evil despite you lying to them in the first place. 
---
The funniest part is you do these things because you want more accessible groups to get into whenever you feel like, but the frustration that the behavior of players like you cause only leads to less players making groups; and those that do becoming more toxic. That's why I thank you for helping our cause. 
---
So sweet, like strawberries, but salty like the sea.
---
That looks quite real
---
&gt; so I did...and I wound up in one with a 35 Agony rating. Not sure if I messed up, or the leader messed up the advertising.
---
There is no fractal with a suggested agony resistance of 35, it's either 34 for scale 35 or 36 for scale 36. Both of these are in Tier 2. You can always see what the current fractal you are entering in from the objective track on the right. 
---
&gt;  Pretty sure I was searching in T1, but just Incase is there anything I should look out for when joining through LFG? Should I just stick to the T1 dailies? Is there another way to join groups if you’re not it a Guild?
---
Do any fractal in T1 it doesn't matter what, dailies just give extra rewards. The LFG is the main way to find groups, or joining a guild.
---
&gt; Also, how do I unlock more? Just joining other groups? When I join, can I join from anywhere in the world? Or do I have to be near the portal to get the option to teleport?
---
You can play any fractal as long as you have a group member at the correct fractal level and the agony resistance to survive. You can only enter an instance as long as you are in a map with the entrance. So you can be anywhere in lion's arch and get the prompt. 
---
&gt; Are Fractals a good place to get some of the more shiner gear?
---
No, you can get a couple unique weapons like: 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fractal_weapon_skins
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gold_Fractal_weapons
---
There is a legendary backpiece: 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ad_Infinitum
---
But nothing else much else unique.
---
I asume it should work if you just download client and copy old gw2.dat file.
---
Very few people play CM's and most of the players complained about Nightmare, SO, TO (to some extent) being too long and "raidy", so right now the team focuses on creating fractals which are more in line with the experience which you get in the classic fractals.

Well, i mean if you are that kind of player, nothing i will reply with will change you mind.
---
However, to be fair, let me try to adress some of your points
---
1. &gt; Does outflanked, last laugh, or toxic trail matter at all in Uncat? No. Changes nothing. Does it matter in Siren's Reef? Fuck yes, because now the overtuned amount of adds is literally almost impossible to survive because the ground is 100% covered by AoE damage. 
---
I am not sure if you read the entire post, but there is a reletively easy way to deal with crow, outflanked or not. Dps until 50 take some time to cleave adds down and let your cooldowns come up, then full on burst from 40. Additionally, if you have trouble with the adds, revenant healer mitigates all those you cannot just pull and cleave with his bubble.

2. &gt; None of the instabilities work with all the fractals, either. Do I give a shit about something like slippery slope in snowblind? No, of course not, because it doesn't change anything except make it slightly more difficult to move. The boss fight is going to go the exact same way. Nothing added, nothing lost here. Is it going to matter on Deepstone? Of course it will, because I can't fucking move out of the 10 million AoE spamfests that Anet uses instead of designing interesting mechanics, and then when I do manage to move, I'm going to fall into the disappearing floor. The additional problem with this is that it effects skills as well. When the ENTIRE COMBAT system is built around movement mechanics (dodges, evades, leaps, charges, etc), disabling it turns into 'stand still and auto attack and hope to fuck your healer keeps up.' It literally disables one of the core concepts of the game, so why the fuck would I bother playing it anymore with this shit enabled?
---
You can actually still play the same way with slope, it just requires some forethought on when to stop/start movement, in contrast to the autopilot most people run nowadays. I get that it is frustrating currently, but i don't doubt it will eventually be fun to master (for those who try at least).
---
3. If you have an instability that doesn't matter in one fractal, and makes another one fucking hell on earth, you have a poorly designed mechanic. Making them random doesn't mean people are going to 'design new ways to run fractals,' it means they're going to look at the dailies, and the instabilities, and say 'well there's no fucking way I'm spending an hour of my life sliding around Deepstone, so I guess I'm just not doing that today.'
---
Well, if you project from you and likeminded people onto others, then that might seem that way. I can only speak for myself that i'd rather try something harder than autopilot 100cm with the same 3 instabs for several months again.
---
RIGHT! That happened, i forgot about the nerf, might actually come back to farm silverwastes again!
---
&gt;How so?
---
When I press tab it targets the Mesmer first instead of its clones the majority of the time. 
---
not enough to justify the shit change. besides, for more loot you need to pay shitload for account fractal upgrades or w/e, and you get titles, Fractal God being the last(best) one
---
i don't really know much about it because i pretty much quit fractals for good when they introduced shitty rng instabilities, and these new instabilities do not make me want to come back at all. waste of time especially with bad pugs
---
Yeah, 1800 gems
---
I assume you'll be providing everyone with the free sets of ascended armor and AR they need to gear other classes for T4's?  **^/s**  
---
^ That's exactly why suggesting people "adapt" *seems* like a much better idea than it actually is.  I'd wager that something like 3/4ths of the T4 population only has 1-2 classes geared.  Often times the newer support class/builds use new gear that's more difficult to acquire like Diviners, Harrier's or more expensive gear like Minstrel's.  It's just not a practical suggestion.  
---
Well, for that something along the lines of a healtempest for vigor would be great, or just some mobility options. As far as trin goes: You rarely ever have to dodge in the fight, so why not save it for birds?
---
Depending on how well you throw them.
---
Does not need to be perfectly geared, just running something like extre reflects or stab on dh can sometimes do the trick already.

Man, you're pretty hot-headed there, calm down.
---
First, you have to answer with your own definition of toxicity.
---
Then.
---
&gt; Nobody ever said you needed 250 li to be able to kill sab.
---
LFGs, many LFGs are disagreeing.
---
&gt; But if they call you out? Then they're toxic and unacceptable. 
---
Mixng up calling names and calling out is a mistake at best, a deliberate fallacy at worst. "You are dying too much and failing mechanics" is not the same thing as "you worthless piece of trash, go kys".
---
&gt; That's why I thank you for helping our cause. 
---
That's why you're obviously way less than me inclined to discuss, and prefer keeping the agressive stance. Well, guess what, that will indeed help your cause.
---
&gt;Ah gotcha. I didn't really pay attention due to me alt+tabbing at my internship.
---
The ultimate tab target challenge. 
---
from someone who exclusively did t4 fractals(not anymore), and got into raids just few months ago, trust me, raids are a lot easier in general
---
Because of the stupid minority that keeps asking anet to make fractals more challenging instead of doing raids.
---
I stopped doin fractals when they introduced those annoying instabilities.
---
If I want to be challenged I go do motherfucking raids.
---
I don't try to ruin the fun the rest by adding shit most people don't like to a game mode. 
---
And to anet, keep listening to the wrong crowd it has worked great for you so far./s
---
Closest enemy hotkey.
---
Or tab, which prioritizes big enemies. 
---
But it's fine because you can just slot in stability or reflects, right? Omegalul. 
---
There are lots of farming guides. There are also plenty of commanders who run zergs amongst the various metas so all you need to do is a little research and then learn as you go. The Istan meta is a lot of fun
---
\*palpatine voice* it's not a build Snow Crows would show you.
---
Nah, it's a very powerful off-meta resurrection/barrier spam build that's near useless in optimized runs but incredible with weaker or less experienced players (like in a training run or a casual run). Google "magic teapot heal scourge" for the rundown, but it's full Magi gear (healing/precision/vitality) with Mercy runes (increased revive potency) and main hand dagger for functionally inexhaustible life force. Basically lets you throw gigantic barriers on all ten teammates and easily recover from 5+ man downstate situations.
---
It's not on SC because aside from "covers for mistakes" it doesn't offer much outside of CC, but for runs where you're using a second healer anyway it can just smooth any encounter out.
---
Because it's so cheap to gear and very personally survivable, it's my go to build to throw at people who are absolutely new to raids and afraid of the scene.
---
Technically yes, but you get each ascended jewelry by collecting all the skins of each dungeon.
---
Sounds very cool thank you! 
---
The problem is certain fractals were designed so that you get surrounded rapidly by mobs, like the wisps in swampland. It results in most people just getting destroyed and leaving.
---
I use it for raids and fractals and it does great dps has a lot of utility and a decent amount of cc.  On top of that it looks cool too. Also it has different tiers of difficulty you can slowly upgrade into as you get more comfortable with it
---
don't use minstrel, it's a terrible crutch which has the sole purpose of afk tanking in raids with very very bad team support..
---
outside of that, you already can cause quite a few aggro problems with the extra toughness from the firebrand traitline/skills in raids..no reason to complicate it further via toughness gear
---
so if you are planning on being a healer in raids harrier seems the right choice
---
for fractals healing is not necessary(a bunch of plebs will try to counterargue this) and it's also problematic because of how agony and poison(from various instabilities and whatnot) severly reduce healing output
---
guardian has decent sources of aegis and blocking&gt;&gt;&gt;healing especially given the fast pace of the fights..active mitigation is superior and you can provide protection and projectile reflects too
---
tl;dr berserker+diviner for fractals, harrier for raids..if you wanna build more towards support you should add healing not toughness
---
Definitely this. Its not worth subjecting yourself to doing things you dislike because of FOMO or anything along those lines.
---
Unfortunately, that didn't cross my mind until I was well into collecting. The closest I have is the overflow crates. And since I stopped opening that type of cache when I got at least 250 of each of its crate drops, we can maybe extract an approximate number of caches opened and assign an average number of crates per cache opening that way. But I'm afraid I'm not good enough at math to do this.
---
- galdalf
---
Ya, seems like i just can't alt tab or i crash.  gotta put everything on the other monitor when i play just incase
---
To satisfy my own curiosity maybe. Also, I did get other things on the way to the chests that I did not factor into the profits, since this post is specifically about the crates. 
---
In terms of efficiency for time spent? Not really. Istan pre-nerf would have netted much more gold in the same time. But then I wouldn't know if I should bother keeping keys on me to open those stray caches or not. 
---
Now that I know they're worth about 8s, and I know exactly what the worth of each type of cache is, it's more or less a matter of "how far will the cache displace me from my way?" "And do I have a spare key without needing to do a stupid heart for it?". I finally have answers to those questions that I kept asking myself whenever I saw a cache on the map. As well as other questions such as "is this type of cache worth it?" Since the most common cache I encounter is Daoud. ANET even replaced all caches on the episode 5 map with **only** Daoud. 
---
 And how did that go? 
---
My problem is really just the birds, it might just be me, but i have a hard time seeing the birds in time to dodge with all the visual effects that seams to over shadow everything, so it spawns the crows.
---
Then i feel the birds come back too often.
---
Other then that i dont really have a problem with it or the others, maybe ban some instabilities from some of the fractals
---
I would love to get the Heroic Edition for my friend who's trying to get into the game. Nice of you for giving the codes away. 
---
Kits are only one of multiple skill types for engineer and definitely not their main mechanic.
---
The big offenders for me are birds and bleed fire. The simple reason is that they make you use up a dodge, which plenty of encounters require judicious use of. If an encounter requires two dodges, and these mechanics are in play, you either soak the mechanic (often a one shot) or the instability. So these just translate to extra “unavoidable” damage. 
---
Sliding around, without stability helping at all is also bad, and really bad on CM, but is otherwise fine on normal T4. It’s the extra damage on top of already high damage output fractals that make the new instabilities tough. 
---
&gt; We had no time to learn the new stuff, wait until ppl get the habits down.
---
It's pretty hard to get habits doing a content when you feel it so boring that you just stop doing that content. When a content in a game is not fun, there is no need to do it more than three times, no need to shoehorn everything.
---
 Fractal changes happened 35+ days ago, we had time.
---
As far as that Spider goes, I never fight her. I run in, torch 4, and start gathering, making sure to dodge any of the spider's attacks. Sometimes I just despawn her instead if I'm not on Mirage.
---
Normally gifts are sent instantly. Are you sure you have used the right name and the recipients inbox  insn't full?  If yes, you should better contact the support.
---
Sadly, I can't send them bread until my account is a week old.
---
I didn't buy anything recently, but from my experience gift delivery is instant. Maybe you made a mistake in their name and sent items to someone else?
---
&gt; Why is it taking so long to actually get to the person I'm trying to gift them to?
---
how long is "so long"? 
---
how you paid with the gems should have no impact on when you (or anyone else) receive things that you go on to buy with those gems.
---
I thought I'd put another comment regarding the challenge aspect since that is a bit different from the idea with instances.
---
In a PvE MMO what I really want are difficult bosses that take time to master but can be tackled through different compositions of dps, tank, healer, support or whatever without huge discrepancies. Since we don't really have the latter yet, I'd really like for challenging bosses to be challenging because they have been designed that way. I'd prefer to learn phases, struggle with mechanics, try out new ideas but once mastered have the satisfaction of knowing that boss and being able to deal with it well.
---
The problem with instabilities is they remove that satisfaction of mastery and instead make it about dealing with things that are external to how the encounter was designed. This might be fine if a certain combination of instabilities were applied to the same instance for more than one day but as it stands, the instabilities change too quickly to really give that satisfaction of truly overcoming something that is difficult. Often it feels like just scraping through sometimes and even if you wanted to get better at that particular combination, it's a different one you face the next day.
---
So while instabilities can add challenge, it never feels like a satisfying challenge to overcome. It feels like a nuisance that is detracting from dealing with the boss or encounter itself. 
---
Is the Style Guide collections worth it if my purpose is to get an ascended accessory? Seems like it could save some laurel but costs many other things
---
Did all of Arah through WvW. Cause it's impossible to pug-fill that dungeon w/ experienced players.
---
That make sense, but honestly speaking bloodstone from "lore" point of view, it is red so it make sense to make it no- dyeable , but I totally agree with you, some designs are so pretty that it screams for variants with dyes.
---
*stare* "THAT was a half-assed roll!"

[Well no more Karma for me then](https://youtu.be/Vf8VvsufQ4k?t=40)
---
start in staff for range/aoe or swap to a focus to stack mobs with skill 4. an then cleave with axe/torch? 
---
Hehe 🙃 
---
Elementalist is the king of AoE. It has a lot of diversity because it can constantly swap between the 4 elements, but can only equip one weapon set because of that. It's generally very strong for end-game content, but very squishy with few defensive options. The elite specs are both viable in their own rights, but are usually just bigger glass cannon paths. If you like tight rotations and big aoe numbers, go for it. 
---
Change that out of range moa to BIRD MOBS that spawn after the Bird instab after you dodge roll...
---
I'll try that. 3 seconds just didn't seem long enough. Also, how do you despawn her (or anything, for that matter)?
---
Is there a way to view what recipes I currently own? I have been saving all of the armor / weapon recipe boxes, and it’s time to unlock them, but I don’t want to duplicate recipes or pieces that I already own.
---
Thank you for the detailed explanation. I'll try that next time. Would you be able to make a video? All videos featuring Mirage are single target.
---
Haha, right!? That voice acting... So fun.

Rift had a Wardrobe tab you could activate. You could even have multiple outfits configured (extra slots cost money) so you could select between several wardrobe looks.

I had a blast!

Character model? That huge blue fire nuclear explosion? That boss is in every zone...
---
I love them instabilites aswell you know why ? It kills the game ahaahaahhh 
---
Meta events since hot is dead.Pvp is dead.WvW is dead. Now fractals are dead. All we can do in late game is shity achievements to collect because we play a singleplayer game. If i was the ceo of anet i would instantly fire the idiots that made instabilities and then i would fire myself for allowing it to happen.
---
Just one dodge roll during the quickness proc or a boss teleport/immunity would greatly lower its usefulness, whereas the flat 5% damage isn't conditional at all. It may sound like a very minor increase on paper, but if you're min-maxing damage to the extent where a theoretical 1% increase is useful, you're likely running a meta build with a trusted static group anyway, where you will almost certainly have 100% (or close to) quickness up time anyway.
---
In case you must know, even on games with PvE MM, it is often not used for endgame content.
---
If you wanna run specialized content then you must use party finders and static partymates.
---
Must be some pretty awful pug you have if you dont have quickness at all...
---
I suspect a break in the formula is what they are aiming for.  
---
An expansion is not announced but will happen 100% in the distant future.
---
I had this same problem. I’d fly through the firecrackers on my griffon and it wouldn’t register. I would then have to turn around, land and repeatedly jump into the firecracker a good 3-4 times before it would finally register.
---
Basically every fractal pug for me. I have to supply myself with quickness by Reaper's Onslaught
---
Obviously one pug group is representative of the whole raid community.
---
never trust a pug, still able to kill most the bosses without quickness, but at least i dont have issues with quickness anymore since switching from force.
---
Autotargeting was also a lot better in GW1
---
What pugs are you playin with, that you never get any Quickness at all? Oo
---
It's more about how good you are at doing skill-rotation to e.g. keep Quickness up (Harrier has more concentration per piece), if you need power at all (Minstrel makes you quite a bit more beefy compared to Harrier).
---
Here is a website where you can look up "agreed upon" builds depending on what you want to do.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guardian
---
You will see that most Support-Firebrand-Build feature full Minstrel's / Maklain's, since it's simply the stat combination that makes most sense in those situations.
---
many, on monday its a bit less of an issue. More often than no quickness you have like 33 to 50% uptime or something
---
&gt; Wow! That is alot of very helpful info.! Just to make sure I understand correctly. The mist talisman and mist band are one of those item that let you double click and select a stat group right?

Mist Talisman and Mist Band let you select stats once. Then they are fixed to those stats.

Oh cool didn't know that. Was in the process of grinding a vision crystal and the dungeoneer chest gives one.
---
I think it also boils down to what people find as fun. I play fractals sometimes twice with 2 different group of guildies, guildies group 1 just treat fractal like a job, they just wanna run them as efficiently as they can and get them over with; however with guildies group 2 we have fun in the fractals, every instabilities that we can use to kill each other is consider good. 
---
Fluxbomb? It's use to kill each other's rotation and dps. Social awkardness? Have you met this cliff before? Oh i see you already have. So you want heals? Sure lemme just bring you this nice fluxbomb as well.
---
With guildies group 2 you'd think we never finish the fractals, but no it is only a lil bit slower (5 to 10 mins give or take), and we have a lot of fun doing it. We yell at each other in ts, keeping fluxbomb scores and have a good time. 
---
What did you say about the birds? Yea fuck them. 
---
Siren's Reef is still a bit weird for both of my groups, we breeze through it sometimes but sometimes just fails it hard. I think I want to give it a little more time before I draw my conclusions. I did notice regardless of instabilities a fb makes things smoother most of the time for that fractal.
---
Nectar of the gods 
---
Cultural armor achievement IIRC is the only that explicite states that you need to "buy" all cultural amor pieces. Unfortunately that means that just unlocking them with Wardrobe Unlocks doesn't count.
---
Anet should take a look at how DE implements Sorties in Warframe.  They're a chain of random mission types with random debuffs, increasing difficulty, and a chance at a decent reward at the end.  Limit one run per day per account.  A GW2 equivalent could be to reach into the VAST bucket of existing content - story instance boss fights and dungeons, for example, or content that hasn't been seen since LWS1 - and make those available as a daily fractal - same content (like, Honor of the Waves path three, for example) only with (reworked, hopefully) instabilities added.
---
I think a major issue with fractals as repeatable content is after a few weeks, you've seen it all and the only challenge is faster clears.  Siren's Reef should still have the new car smell but even that is "oh, this again" already.
---
&gt;not their main mechanic.
---
it's one of them.
---
Squeezing Putrid Orrians?
---
no, it's just a skill type
---
I’m not huge on GW lore, but that’s dope. Glint is the scion is presume? 
---
Simple. Stop making things that used to be accessible much harder but with the same rewards. This is a casual game. When things that were fine before suddenly require double-healer, advanced communication, guarantee several wipes, people _just leave_. Either make CM mode for those few who want things to be harder, or bump up in-progress rewards.
---
Average pugs don't have fully geared up multiple classes. And what they have now became inadequate. Veterans will be fine. But veterans are not the casual players whom this is beating over the head with "you're no longer adequate, get new gear or no more t4 rewards for you". That is frustrating and stupid. 
---
A _single_ new instability raises floor a bit to "a lot" (you now have to kill everything even though before devs said "oh just skip it, these mobs are meant to be optional"). Multiple ones are progressively worse. And if average pugs start to leave, those still somewhat juicy gem sales might start to dwindle.
---
I hate instabilities but this comment is too much, I see you are raging but don't get personal.
---
It's likely a direction from his bosses to make fracs harder and longer - I wish it wasn't the case. 
---
i think they really stopped using .MPQ around WoD
---
Lol, thanks for that one
---
tolgon likes little anime bois
---
It depends on what you want to play. Elementalist has a bunch of play styles.
---
In terms of DPS, Weaver generally takes the top spot. Sword tends to have high single target damage and mobility whereas staff is better for AoEs but has lower mobility and sustain.
---
Tempest is basically elementalist++ but a lot of people see it as a support spec. DPS tempests generally do better than core does but not as good as a Weaver. Support wise, the buffing capability is there but the buffs aren't strong enough for tempest to be meta. Healing tempests provide the most healing output in the game but classes that can heal and buff are preferred in end game content.
---
Tempest's support also makes it sustain himself better in the open world, providing more options for healing, buffing and situational auras (magnetic aura for eg)
---
Elementalists have complex skill rotations, involving using skills in at least 2/3 attunements for Max DPS. This means that the elementalist has to work harder to achieve expected DPS, but it also provides more situational utility with more skills. Weaver is considered more complex because attunement swaps are more frequent and you have to swap early to get off have skills when you need them.
---
As for sustainace, the elementalist has a while slew of options. Nothing that will make you super tanky, but still provide a bunch of "oh shit" buttons. Some weapon skills have a evades/invulns, all cantrips are defensive, arcane shield blocks damage, there's a trait to get another arcane shield, you can get AoEs to spawn when you are downed to rally etc. Water skills also provide quite a lot of healing. Mist form is probably one of the best downed skills in game.
---
its a very small window but its possible for sure.
---
Thank you
---
and mechanically is mostly the same as elementalist swapping attunements or guardian using tomes; you only use kits because they are good enough, if they were nerfed you would not be using them and not even care about their existence, so much for profession flavour
---
Why are you posting a 4 year old, irrelevant video?
---
OK... so they can go play different games together. People will always stop playing a game eventually. What is relevant is whether or not they are being replaced, which it is clear in this case that they still are.
---
Thanks for all that info! Is weaver using dual swords or is staff better? Can It do open world pve solo pretty easy?
---

---
Start the collection by buying the [5g + karma item](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Flameseeker_Prophecies_Vol._1). Then buy the recipe. Then craft the recipe.
---
Not even when it lets you choose the recipes?
---
Yea the problem with the new SA is that it can cause you to interrupt some of your skills because someone pushed you thus causing the game to cancel the skill, such as Shield 5 on Chronomancer.
---
What would you say is fine for solo pve world play? And also, I can't switch between staff and sword dagger?
---
You know your TLDR is supposed to be, well, *succinct*?
---
Honestly the draw of diviners is that it allows FB &amp; Ren to replace a chrono.
---
And since you will have a FB in the group this makes rage sigil not needed.
---
In the pics, what is that thing to the right of the pickaxe (mining tool)?
---
Thanks, I am glad you like it :) I will probably have to get lost for a bit in the Maguuma Jungle to find more materials

Maybe increase the timer, and we would have similar mechanics like Cairn CM.

Sorry if I get it wrong, I’ll reduce it.

I run Axe/Pistol + Scepter/Torch
---
For the most part, Axe/Pistol is what I main, but switch to Scepter/Torch when I want either a bit of range OR I want to blast AOE with the torch then run out with stealth if I get stuck in a group. I also play Condi so if you're power, a lot of this won't quite be relevant.
---
As for Utilities (I mainly / pretty much exclusively play PVE) I mainly run False Oasis, Illusory Ambush, Crystal Sands and Null field (Mostly pretty much for mass condi cleanse) and Jaunt. I'm at the at the moment so I couldn't tell you the exact spec, but on the Mirage I run Self-Deception, Mirrored Axes and Infinite Horizon.
---
Axe 3, Illusory Ambush and Jaunt are really great ways to get around in a fight, and gaining mirage cloak when you have your axe in a group is a great way to hit groups targets. Also using your axe 3 ability to reset your clones just before your current target dies is a great way to not have to constantly work on getting clones back (same goes for Illusory Ambush), and gives you time for your abilities to CD so you can shatter and then create a clone, and use deception skills to get the last couple of clones if you're just trying to shatter for inflicting more conditions (As well as Jaunt causing Confusion)
---
Comboing a group with a Shatter 1 or 2 + Crystal sands to apply conditions to a groups is another really good way.
---
Personally I find the trick is to try and be as mobile with your abilities as possible, but then I also don't play specifically to what the meta is. Take from this what you will.
---
~woosh 
---
You sly dog. You memed my meme. How dare you! 
---
Not always. Sometimes it gets funky with legendary gear. Once I ended up doing an entire raid wing with zerk/scholar armor.... on my heal druid. 
---
I think? That it prioritizes based on hp or something? In pve, it always reliably targets the highest-ranked mob first at least, and in pvp I usually get the real mesmer. 
---
I think Birds is fixable. Make them deal passive damage with no blind, but make the dodge to remove birds consume no stamina. Suddenly you have a DoT that can be held and "consumed" for a free dodge if you can handle the damage it deals. It also needs to be restricted to only triggering if you're in combat with enemies that are not birds.
---
Slippery Slope also feels like something just isn't working right with it. If Stability nullified the slipping, that'd be something. Not sure if that'd be enough to make that disaster of an instability salvageable, but it just feels like that's what you were intended to do to counter it.
---
Afflicted also isn't a problem *if you are a Firebrand*. But it's far too much to deal with if you're not that, especially if you're fighting something that applies natural conditions. An ICD would help a lot, or if only Vets and higher applied conditions. Alternatively, if cleansing a condition cleansed another condition on 5 targets around you it'd encourage teamwork and managing your cleanses collectively.
---
Everything else you said I agree with 100%.
---
Very nice!
---
Yes, that pretty much sums it up.
---
Deadeye is the obvious first choice, but if that’s not for you there’s only engineer and warrior that have rifles. Engineer rifle is treated more like a shotgun and warrior rifle has high hitting skills then has a burst skill called Kill Shot that has maxed range and hits insanely high. 
---
But if you’re going for a sniper feel, nothing is gonna beat Deadeye. It’s got the highest damage of the three and the unique kneel mechanic that only it has that makes the rifle feel a bit more dynamic. 
---
Other than that your closest shot is warrior. 
---
The new Fractals aren't even like the "classic" Fractals, though. Classic fractal had way less dialogue, weren't as long, and typically have lots of skips/strategies to clear them fast. The newer fractals are super linear and force you through chokepoints of content such that optimal runs aren't actually that much faster than normal attempts. 
---
I appreciate that the newer fractals are better at telling story (which Fractals should be able to do) but it's come at the expense of them having enjoyable gameplay. And in Siren's Reef case the story isn't actually good, it's just fed to you by the narrator. 
---
Many thanks!! That means a lot to me :) I spend lots of time outside in nature photographing and studying plants. Together with my passion for fantasy worlds like in GW2 I just had to try to craft some.

I don't know about you guys... but I rarely lag once everything is loaded properly.  Your mileage may vary, I guess.

I feel like these posts are identical at this point.

Firebrands are Guardians
---
4 years ago culling was not the problem anymore...
---
Actually right about now the first guild killer balance patch came out, the stab stacking in intensity.
---
You are just another guy who mistakes difficulty with annoyance.
---
And if you're plugging any PvE content, you're better off using Berserker gear and running slightly more CC than the optimal build, because god damn are pugs bad at breaking cc bars. 
---
Did the WvW announcement ever happen or is it looking to be just a bamboozle by Anet?
---
and guardians aren't firebrands.
---
still pretty relevant

Here are the official threads about this issue: 
---
[Announcement P1](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/26547/world-restructuring).

---
[Worlds Linking](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/63868/world-linking-12-21-2018)
---
Since it seems quite a big change, it's my understanding that this should take a long while to actually drop.
---
 &gt; while NPCs cannot be pushed, pulled, feared, etc. off ledges, players can.
---
Especially before getting a glider and in content where gliders are restricted, this can be pretty frustrating to encounter. I understand not wanting players to cheese enemies off of cliffs, but most *important* enemies can't be pulled or pushed as it stands, anyway (defiance bar soaks the CC without letting the player actually *move* these targets). If it's just little foes, and only in certain circumstances, it really shouldn't matter too much. Flying/hovering enemies can remain immune, maybe?
---
Not everyone feels the need to main the most meta character at any given time man, sometimes its enjoyable to just play whats fun to you, ya feel me?
---
&gt; I don't see myself as a "super nice guy" here
---
Neither do I.
---
&gt; I also think there's reasons as to why I am toxic.
---
And I believe there are reasons I do what I do. And it all comes down to this, we will never agree on the matter.
---
&gt; Yet you don't realise you don't help anyone.
---
According to you, I'm helping someone, myself.
---
And you, who are you helping when you set up tight restrictions for your group ? Not yourself ?

The card behind "is this game still worth playing" one is "My gfs pet cats goldfish's boyfriend drew this pic of my Charr and doesnt think its gud, wat u guyz think?"
---
agree, not much more to say after all the other threads. short term it might appear fun, like a game changer that requires more thought. long term however it will become tedious and generally prevent people from forming sufficient new routines and habbits that have kept fractals popular so far.
---
I already love your ideas!!!

To be fair, exactly like the daily posts complaining about instabilities

That sounds bad, so not only would the gold be confiscated but the skins as well, so if you bought 200g, were about that away from a legendary, made the legendary, even though it is 90% clean it gets confiscated.

But how do they know the difference. How would they know whether the person who received the gold bought it themselves or if it was bought by somebody who felt they had been wronged by them?

&gt; Well, some smart man once said the only thing comparable to the size of the universe was human stupidity, but given what i personally have experienced, if you give people a chance to learn, most will take it.
---
Trying to improve your chance of success is considered stupid? 
---
Hard to disprove, harder to prove. I've been toying with the idea since PoF, as many of the events in the Desert seemed to mirror the Prophecies, but All or Nothing made me consider it in a new light.
---
Drop rate data posts show up during every festival that has bags of some sort, when new content releases that has its own bags, and whenever someone's amassed enough of a ridiculous number of older bags, so I'd say they're actually reasonably common, albeit not constant.
---
I don't understand your reply, sorry.
---
The first couple links you pasted are regarding WvW alliances, and the supposed announcement was confirmed about the devs not to be about that.
---
The third link is just about the latest regular server re-link that happened a almost two months ago and has nothing to do with the announcement.
---
The last link is what I'm asking about. The devs said we'd have an announcement this week and I was asking whether or not it had happened already.
---
Thanks for the effort OP... Maybe ANET will add a reason to farm Buried Treasures one day. ^hope... ^^dies... ^^^last...

I imagine it tastes something like a wine, with ingredients like grapes,blueberries, and blackberries.

---
"hey I'm new to this game and I played x in WoW. What build should I try in gw2 and why is it engineer"
---
At least it's giant cat men instead of "random female character but with enormous tits" like 90% of the other subreddits.
---
They definitely do seem to be holding up a mirror to Proph and NF, I'll agree with you there. 
---
If you want a smokescale and have Heart of Thorns, I’d be happy to escort you to get it. 
---
It's worth noting that for holosmith, while the no-kit static discharge build benchmarks a bit lower, the dps is far less bursty and much less sensitive to movement as a good chunk of the damage comes from firing off two projectiles and static discharges (particle accelerator and surprise shot) every six seconds. It's very consistent and can end up higher on more mobile / frequent phasing bosses that can otherwise cause you to whiff your kit skills.
---
True, but only when it's a Charr. Human Female Meta means we get a fair bit of that over here too.
---
Yeah, instead it’s just a bunch of furry shit, much better. 
---
They do that all the time tho XD I'm no soothsayer so I'm not saying this is set in stone, but everything I just explained could be explained 10 times quicker by Glint saying "I lied".

The only way I can play necro is by using reaper. I'm just not a fan of scourge or base necro with hardly any meaty melee attacks. I agree with your opinion on rev too, there is too little choice for utility for me to enjoy it for a long time.
---
At least ten different shades of grey and/or pink! 
---
I am in the same boat. Mirage staff Mesmers with offhand GS for tagging is amazing. Hard to kill but not that hard to kill. Takes a bit to build up damage but I can solo champs roaming the world in POF. It's not faceroll but it certainly fun.
---
Also long bow ranger is fun and easy.
---
If you want to push it, Weaver staff ele is as borderline as I'll go. I get downed a lot in solo play but it's fun.
---
If it's to a high pop server. Lower pop servers are cheaper
---
You forgot the most fun of em - Sandbinders in the Twilight Oasis fractals which constantly pull you into damage and escalate quite a number of instabs to higher Levels of unfun to play against (we bleed fire, stick together, outflanked, hamstrung...)
---
Some d20 are actually spin-down health counters, meaning you can easily switch from 20 to 19 to 18 to 17 to... 1 in a single, easy move, rather than looking for the next number on the opposite-ish side of the dice.
---
all they have to do is make a Ploymuck mobile game with a Gw2 tie in to use the account+authentication which allows you to use your minipets and gain and add more, new or better combat features like training them.
---
Mesmer
---
Because Anet keeps overloading their kits all the time and they end up having to nerf them repeatedly.
---
I agree with this 100%. Warrior doesn't require much thinking all you do is press a button or two and stuff dies. It requires a much more active play style than minion mancer and when you are ready for it, you can build for more reaction based play style.
---
Just living up to role model by being angry all the time whinging about evil casuls coming to steal our hardcore content and wvw experiences 
---
Hey OP. The damage loss by sacrificing stats is greater than the gain you would get from quickness.
---
Personally I think these "swirl" attacks should be "rolling to hit" against the player's armour rating instead of automatically applying the movement effect.  It is not good game design.
---
Ranger is pretty boring imho. They may be my least played toons.
---
&gt;  It's like they started to think the rewards for T4 dailies were too good and decided to cripple the players with all this timewasting bs.
---
Bingo! They've done that in other parts of the game so why not fractals.
---
Still better than juggposting
---
Yeah anyone can, but not everyone will.
---
I play Ele and can second most of the things that've been said here but I want to emphasize how squishy ele is.
---
You quite literally die to everything. The damage output is amazing assuming you position super well or someone else is absorbing all the damage. You die to every random thing even when the enemy isn't looking at you. You quite literally cannot survive 80% of the things that can hit you and I've died far too many times to things I thought were inconsequential. This is quite literally the class that has to hit an "oh shit" button if you so much as take several stacks of poison. 
---
If stability has short duration in most of its sources for a good reason. If players could counter slippery slope with stability, it would have to be more spammable, or players would feel forced to bring professions that can spam it more often.  
---
A solution to that would be making the anti-slide effect a different one that would be a bit safer to spam as it would have less impact in direct combat pressure. 
---
For example, they could add a new boon called "Freedom", and make it part of a 'triad of immunities' along with Resistance and Stability. One for damage, one for disables, and one for movement. 
---
* Freedom would eliminate any negative movement component from enemy effects. So any Control effect that cause movement like fear, float or launch would behave like daze, only disabling skills without affecting movement. Crippled and immobilize would have no effects under Freedom, and Chilled would not have its movement slowdown component, but keep its cooldown slowdown.  
---
Freedom would also make characters immune to these 'forced sliding' effects that we see in slippery areas, the waterfall in Tarir, and in those vortexes some awakened do that make players circle around them before the vortex explodes.  
---
If they ever add some sort of "grab" or "grapple" mechanic that allows a character to hold another and fling it around, like in fighting games, it would also make characters immune to that. 
---
* Resistance would no longer deal with the movement component of conditions, only damage conditions and the debuffs that can reduce or increase damage: blind, weakness, vulnerability, slow, and the cooldown slowdown from chilled, bit not the movement slowdown from chilled. 
---
* Stability would no longer prevent movement effects, only hard control effects. So when feared, taunted, knocked back, launched or floated, skills would still be usable, but the character would be pushed or slide in the corresponding direction. . 
---
After the change, most skills that currently give stability and resistance would also get freedom for a similar or shorter duration so they maintain a functionality closer to the previous one. 
---
Further adjustments would be done later, depending on how things go. 
---
That would leave us with the ability to put freedom in more skills would giving them resistance or stability, allowing players to spam more freedom, and it'll also be possible to have longer or shorter freedom to skills independently from stability and resistance, and adjust the 3 boons separately even for PvE/PvP/WvW  splits. 
---
And since Freedom would prevent those sliding effects, players would be able to spam them a bit more, independetly from how much they may be able to spam stability, allowing keeping stability as a tool to prevent skill disables, while adding a tool to avoid forced movements. 
---
When you moa the moa
---
If gem store items are possible I’d say either the copper fed salvage or a set of infinite mining tools.
---
You've put the finger on why more normal dungeons are better than fractals and how GW2s combat system without any real combat roles at all actually restricts the development of interesting PvE mechanics.
---
Use shatters and shatter often. Don't save your shatters for a rainy day. Both mind wrack and cry of frustration hit five targets. Get three clones out (torch 5, axe 2, and jaunt if you have the self deception trait) and then immediately shatter them. Anything less than a vet should die, and if not then swap to staff and use 2 and 3, and use 4/5 and standing in the 5 to benefit from the boons. Once the staff 3 phants turn into clones, shatter again. Always be in melee range when you shatter. Shatter, shatter, shatter! 
---
Yep, you can capture a great deal of the sniper essence w/ LBow Ranger, but Deadeye was expressly made to have "Sniper" written all over it.
---
CC may not have a tutorial which it should do but it is has also been around since HoT, you can't tell me that all those player haven't learnt to CC especially when a bunch of people sit on bunnies before most events to get a decent start on a breakbars. This thread is calling it bad game design but the issue seems to be lazy player base in the case of the swirly death.
---
I don't understand why everyone always says build templates... I have never particularly needed that. I suppose being able to copy a code for a build from online would be slightly more convenient but it only takes a few seconds to change skills and traits. 
---
mesmer 
---
Instead, we need more encounters where the entire maps is constantly covered in a non stop parade of AoE warning circles, with no real indication which are a nuisance amount of damage vs one shot instagib you and the next character you roll amount of damage.
---
being able to duel people all over pve maps would be a nightmare..
---
i mean imagine wanting to do say chak gerent but 20 people decided they wanna battle each other instead..it would be messy as hell
---
better designated duel areas would be great though! they kinda did that with certain parts of wvw and the pvp pit or whatever you wanna call it but they're far from what they could be!
---
you are right about gear inspection but this sub will never agree with you because the majority play their own builds and are worried about this imaginary elitism
---
it's a sound logical argument until you realize about 5s later that pinging kill proofs and gear and showing titles is a thing already..you can already see via arcDPS so much info that you can deduce the performance and gear to some point..it would just streamline a process that's already occuring right now
---
the reason they oppose even cosmetic checks is a mix between the slippery slope fallacy(skins now? stats next!) and some people just don't want their look copied
---
of course being able to opt out of a cosmetic gearcheck wouldn't create any form of elitism(obviously) and many would be proud to share their looks
---
**tl;dr** carebear haters that don't want their casual utopia ruined for real or imaginary reasons
---
I wish rangers had better control over pet agro, either pulling off the pet, or dropping agro to the pet (outside of longbow stealth)
---
&gt; too ugly to appeal to furries

I dont think this is a possibility.

I imagined it being sweet and fizzy.

Sort of like cotton candy, but with a bit more tang. Because we only get karma when we do good things. Maybe bad flavors of karma exist, but if they do, we don't get them.

For guardian, if you haven't yet, try a quickness-spamming Firebrand "Quickbrand" build. It makes it feel like a very different class, and is super useful in groups giving 100% Quickness uptime. You can run either power or condi variants, though I think right now power is higher dps. I'm currently running a hybrid of [Hizen's "Balthazar" build](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand) and a [standard Fractals Firebrand build](https://discretize.eu/builds/guardian/hybrid-firebrand). Looks like [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vVAQNAR3dnsADFBjFCBuCBEEhl4BrKA0AqXWlg8Vka/lWT7pA-jRSBQBCWJoxuoCA4JFYJVVEpSq/qWxV2fAP6eCsylAAJA/yvkv0X6L/yv8L/lzz8MPzz847MPzz8MPzz88lf588lSBs7YA-e).
---
This is a mesmerizing display of skill, holy cow. I'm mostly impressed but also im a tiny bit afraid of op. op too powerful, but pls dont nerf.
---
Also both base Necro and Scourge feel slow af. Scourge has cast times on just about everything which makes it feel quite tedious to play unless you're in a group with high Quickness uptime.
---

---
Seriously, what were we even expecting...
---
grape mikes harder ofc
---
I don't even know how an announcement is related to being able to access the infrastructure unless they are planning to implement it right away.
---
They could have at least given us a teaser...
---
From a personal gameplay perspective, mesmer. I have just never found a playstyle for mesmer that's terribly interesting to me. I'd much rather play something that's less useful but more fun to actively play since I have the choice.
---
Would be nice if they would've communicated this earlier in the week, but ok.
---
I guess even announcement wasn't written up?
---
The swirly attack is easy to avoid if you know how. Run in the direction of the swirl and a little to the outside. Your momentum will carry you out of the radius if done correctly. No dodge required.
---
That being said I do think stability should prevent these types of effects from working.
---
apparantly its hard to announce almost finalised information now. who knew
---
Aha..hah..ha.... AHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Hate to tell you but that could happen in t1 fractals or tarir south metas as well. Still sad that you had to deal with that crap. Some people just lash out to others to distract them from their pitiful self.
---
I really want to like rev, I just hate that both your abilities and weapon skills draw from the same resource... I often end up bone dry on energy and either have to swap out of the legend I want to use to get more, or sit an auto attack until it comes back.
---
Only if you can make the difference.
---
Jormag strikes again!
---
If Balthazar is the betrayer the Betrayed could be Zafirah. 
---
Did you just assume his performance?!?
---
the studio was closed 3 whole days.
---
Such a meme.
---
Make sure you have the sigils in your weapons that give you 50% endurance on weapon swap, and have the +40% endurance regen food. Then dodge a lot to trigger both the weapon skill #1 Ambush attack and evasion. The Axe ambush bursts conditions, as does Axe #2. Try to both use those frequently and also time them for when the champion mob attacks you to avoid its damge.
---
LOL
---
&gt; due to bad weather.
---
Likely meaning the person announcing it wasn't there to do so, not that development work had been delayed on it.
---
right on. always happy to see wvw and pvp content here.
---
&gt; the dps is far less bursty
---
This is a really bad thing (and is why with kits people use rifle instead of sword); most bosses have phases or are short enough that burst damage is much more valuable than sustained.
---
Yes but the amount of effort to get it is nearly the same as getting ascended vipers, so nobody bothers with exotic vipers.
---
We are announcing that the announcement announcing the announcement was in error due to weather. We are now announcing that we'll announce the announcement later. 
---
Tornado has a big ass indicator and you can move out of its range or others can break its bar for you to get released. It is not really in this category, imo.
---
At least the WvW is consistently inconsistent 
---
Man i wish the one booing was that bird in the meme where the crow shouts over it
---
Lots of salty mesmer haters in here.
---
Mesmer is probably the best designed class imo, every traitline is useful for something and majority of their utility skills are useful too. Just so much variety on the class. Yes its op but I think other classes are just undertoned. Mesmer is a blast to play when you know the ins and outs and you actually have to think and adapt your build to the gameplay.
---
Engineer is pretty meh for me. Just dont like the skill animations at all and lack of weapons despite them having kits to make up for it. Holosmith is great but I'd basically be playing that one spec for forever if I ever got into engi. 
---
as far as fun factor goes, both elementalist elite specs are at the top for me along with melee druid and trailblazer firebrand.
---
Wow, all your lights are gorgeous! They're so.. magical looking.
---
&gt; I have a alpine wolf but occasionally I swap it out for a brown bear due to its better tanking ability and skill.
---
Most experienced players find more value in sticking with more DPS oriented pets (cats and birds) than the tanky ones, but feel free to experiment as you like.
---
Something that is not at all obvious is that you get two pets "slotted" at any time, slotted outside of combat (hit K), and you can swap between them in combat (F4). Thus, when you see your pet getting low on health in combat, swap pets and bring the other pet up, at full health.  You'll want to swap before the first one dies, since swapping on a dead pet greatly extends the swap time (60s instead of 20s).
---
ele and ranger, i could never get into playing those or any of their elite specs, elementalist especially.
---
i know they're both good, but they just don't "click" with me
---
Good thing this isn't a theory about what Glint saw then, otherwise I'd be totally wrong and it must have been Timeline B, my mistake
---
Because WvWer are starved for anything that may improve their game mode.
---
&gt;Sure, the diabolic gathering was closed off; for maybe a year or so, then Nightfall didn't so much 'open the door', as much as 'kick down the wall'. How could she have seen the events in Hell's Precipice, and neglected to look out her front door at [The Tomb of the Primeval Kings](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Tomb_of_the_Primeval_Kings), where Abaddon's corruption had already distorted the Tyrian landscape? 
---
This happened after Khilbron's death though. The Flameseeker Prophecies was complete by that point.
---
The Flameseeker Prophecies were, ultimately, about the actions of Khilbron and the genocide of the mursaat through the titans. It was not about Abaddon's return. And it's clear that Glint didn't see all of it because:
---
*"Your escape from the volcano's caldera was no accident. Everything has unfolded as I knew it would. The* [*Flameseeker Prophecies*](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Flameseeker_Prophecies) *have been fulfilled, and the evil machinations of* [*Vizier Khilbron*](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Vizier_Khilbron) *have been put to an end. But a threat still remains. The* [*Titans*](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Titan) *the lich loosed upon the world are causing more trouble than even I could have foreseen. The world is not yet safe, and you still have work to do."*  
---
[https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Vision\_of\_Glint](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Vision_of_Glint)
---
She didn't foresee the extent of the problems the Titans would cause. She just foresaw what would lead to the return and genocide of the mursaat, the ancient race who had betrayed her allies in the past.
---
&gt;All of Glint's manipulations in Prophecies rather seemed to be ignoring the more problematic threat; she engineered the extinction of the Mursaat, a race of manipulative sorcerers who pretended to be Gods to the Krytans for two short years, by allowing Abaddon to invade the material world and drag it into torment. It seems excessive.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;When the Door of Komalie opened, Abaddon's plan for Nightfall moved closer to fruition. 
---
Not really accurate. If anything at all, the events of Nightfall were **delayed** because of Glint ensuring that the Door of Komalie would close and Khilbron would die. A delay of three years, granted, but a delay all the same. Ultimately, though, the prophecies weren't caring about them. The Door of Komalie's opening ultimately did nothing to further Abaddon's plot.

It's not terribly vague. The first three lines refer to [Ambassador Zain](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Ambassador_Zain).

&gt;Food for thought.
---
Arguable, maybe, though the "betrayed" in this situation did not bring justice to the "betrayer" here; Joko did nothing to hinder or kill Balthazar. Plus, you're going back and forth here in events, whereas if the events refer to Prophecies, everything is in order: THK was under siege, then Saidra died and Markis was killed. Your interpretation has "events of All for Nothing -&gt; events of Path of Fire" and that doesn't make much sense.
---
And what about the rest?
---
A [lost relic](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Storm_Caller_Triumph) will bring hope where there is none
---
It will be celebrated as a gift from the gods
---
But the joy comes chained with sorrow
---
As a bloodline is severed by words
---
A [son](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Prince_Rurik) forsaken, a father blind 
---
How does this possibly fit in? There is no son forsaken by a blind father in GW2. There is no lost relic bringing hope where there was none.
---
 A sound across the heavens brings healing rain
---
To drown fire and soothe smoldering scars 
---
 The mouth lies fallow until the final piece is recovered
---
The beasts fall under the sword, but it will not be enough 
---
Like before, this refers to Stormcaller. There is no relatable comparison. No healing rain, no drowned fire.
---
The threat of war is spurred by Unseen forces
---
Blood will spill with nefarious purpose
---
A clergy will be exalted and reviled
---
By those who wish to speak with the gods 
---
The only Unseen forces to exist are the mursaat. The last mursaat was Lazarus, they're wiped out now, confirmed both in-game and out.
---
 A tyrant whose own hand drowned his lungs in salt water
---
Will rise again from the depths of the abyss  
---
  And those he enslaved will not find liberty or rest
---
The dead will walk again, leaving their sunken graves behind them  
---
This can really refer to no one but Khilbron. How does this relate at all to Kralkatorrik or Aurene?
---
I could continue, but if you look at the whole, it's fairly clear to be referring to the events of Prophecies, and largely in order at that. While a few choice lines can *arguably* link to GW2's events, on a whole they can't.
---
A single offhand line is like a volume of an encyclopedia when it comes to Anet's WvW communication.
---
But Zafirah had nothing to do to bringing justice to Balthazar. The one who did that was the Commander. And they weren't betrayed by Balthazar.
---
Because it's supposed news about WvW.
---
the one who was supposed to announce the delay of the announcement, was delayed due to bad weather.
---
For me the problem of slippery is that u play with it like once i two days for 20 min and it fuck up you movement ... for me it ist enough to get used to it (mb in futre) ... problem is some fights require fast movement to correct position and for me it take lot of practise to make it with slippery so it end up random if i make it or not -_-.
---
Another problem for me ist the fractal wasnt designet with slippery in mind and its anoying.
---
To others lot of times the problem ist one instab but combinations like fire+birds ...
---
Like chicken
---
You get to expect this with ANet, don't you?
---
I mean you're the one making the assumption and looking like a ass. Sure, he *might* defend every blunder but you don't know that. You jump to assume he is because you're so blind to your side of attacking them nonstop. I'm not a fan of Anet but you really need to pick your battles or you just look like a joke.
---
You live you learn. Except Guild Wars 2 player base. 
---
It is impossible to talk about liking or disliking professions without including the external environment that shapes the gameplay. 
---
I think a very real problem that GW2 has is creating meaningful gameplay for all classes in all gamemodes. 
---
To a certain extent this can be mitigated through the "alternative flavor" of elite specializations. However, for several classes, you have a very pronounced lack of variation. 
---
My main (when I was still playing this game) was necromancer. 
---
Base necromancer isn't relevant for anything. And both Reaper and Scourge are clear PvP and WvW specs. 
---
The toolkit needed for PvE and PvP gamemodes has overlap when it comes to desirability. Other professions have had better design decisions made to that end. 
---
As such, even though I mained necromancer, I dislike the design that has gone into the game as it pertains to necromancer. That includes both the internal toolkit that necromancer received, as well as the external environment in which necromancer is asked to apply the toolkit. 
---
And then there are other classes, which overperform so dramatically in their given capacity, that their mandatory nature constricts and smothers the gameplay variety. 
---
For necromancer, this is the flip-side: it is absolutely incredible in PvP gamemodes. Corruption is an incredibly powerful aspect - turning an enemy's strengths into weaknesses. Transferring weaknesses from allies to yourself, before passing it on to the enemies that originated them. It's awesome for the necromancer. But for everyone else, it excludes so many build options and gameplay that I perceive it as incredibly toxic. 
---
The threat of condition distillation mandates condition clears and band-aids like Resistance. 
---
It's lazy and uninteresting design that permeates so much of PvP, along with blatant powercreep. 
---
I mained necromancer. I disliked it more and more, as PvP/WvW lacked any meaningful engagement for me, and PvE had more and more pronounced shortcomings when faced with alternatives. 
---
These complaints are so old and have not been adequately addressed by ANET that it's clear at this point that there isn't anyone there that considers the design of necromancer to be problematic. 
---
And that's why I haven't played GW2 since November 2017 and don't see myself coming back anytime soon. 
---
It'll be cheaper and more efficient if you literally just find a decent guild to run fractals with. I've only ever pugged once and that was a huge mistake. 
---
I am unable to find a group for dungeon since I play off hours on weekdays. I was wondering if doing level appropriate hearts will yield the same result and is it viable? I’ll definitely hop on in any dungeon group if I see one but can hearts carry me till level 80? 
---
&gt;Tornado has a big ass indicator and you can move out of its range very easily while staying in melee range still 
---
Yup, thats the theory. Ask Slippery Slope, Social awkwardness and hamstrung how much that theory holds up in non-T1 fracs.
---
&gt;or others can break its bar for you to get released
---
Try getting others to do that in Pugs. Also, depending on your position and who's left, that isn't all that easy in the timeframe given if you're not a CC heavy build.
---
But then how's he going to manipulate that chode-mouse to the right?! He needs 2 hands on keyboard, 3rd on chode-mouse! It's the winners choice!
---
But Mesmer is Gw2 prized child. Surely they'll get better treatment than the others 
---
They usually have patch day on tuesdays. Also if there is a bigger patch out there is often extra bug fixes. But Tuesdays should be the biggest change. Mind though it do happen sometimes that there is no patch at all one week.
---
Sure, but mirage can be fixed. I just find numbers wrong with mirage.
---
Meanwhile I think chrono is inherently broken in its core.
---
It's just opinion. But I do enjoy the idea that people downvoted me for saying what I dislike, in a thread about classes that people dislike. :^)
---
No fixed time for PVE map resets. Map instances are created/closed based on population so if Snowden Drifts is quiet but not completely empty then one instance may last a very long time and you'll just keep getting the same instance each time. If there is a "Daily Snowden Drifts Event Completer" then that'll make it a lot busier though.
---
If you know there is a patch coming then logging in straight after a patch will guarantee a fresh map instance. 
---
If you mean the announcement that was announced last week on twitch? Yeah that just got announced on twitch today that it's been put back 'til next week due to the bad weather the anet office has been having this week. Another week we wait... choo choo :(

This is why you dont "announce" announcements.
---
You build hype. Which sounds good at face value. But if you build too much hype you can never live up to expectations, and when you fall flat. Oh boy do you fall hard.
---
Even more saddening when you see the ambient armadillo kobs in-game that are much more accurate to an actual armadillo. Don't get me wrong, I love the skin, but I don't love the fact that it's clearly not an armadillo. Pangolin Petey is best Petey though!
---
The fact that he was playing a Scourge was funny to me. 
---
God bless you, you dumbass bot. Very fitting. 
---
this isn't true wtf are you talking about
---
Yeah, yeah we know. It's not these devs fault. Hell they're all great people.
---
Still people can be frustrated, especially because it's wvw announcement. You know we get like 1 per year and even that is delayed...
---
Than we get to the announcement size. Is it going to be event week, which in my mind doesn't require some special announcement to make.
---
Also actual content is important. Is it mounts? That pretty much every WvW player hates to even think about.
---
With track record that ANet has for good WvW changes, all kinds of shit can happen, which fuels everything even more.
