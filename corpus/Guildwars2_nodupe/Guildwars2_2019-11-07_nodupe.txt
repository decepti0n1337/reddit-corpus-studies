what many people forget to consider is that there are many ways to hold a mouse. i myself have been using nagas since the first one released.. i don't know when, and despite multiple attempts i was never able to utilize anywhere near its full potential for the simple reason that the way i hold mice does not work for precise side button activation, and any attempt at adapting my grip would result in cramps.
---

---
nowadays, depending on what i'm doing, i have divided the buttons into 2-3 "zones" so i don't have to be overly accurate and still get some use out of the side pad.
---
---
---
this is the meme i was waiting for
---
Almost all of them have closed recently along the US West Coast (where ANet is located).  There was one in the city next to mine, and last time I was there, it was open.  No longer.  Why they'd partner with a "chain" that's nearly extinct is beyond me.
---
Not a very well point.  I don't know what Blimpie's is.
---
Because the mods are lazy and they don't update it very often. It's been there for months
---
Out of the loop: what's the deal with quiznos?
---
&gt; they got no ressources
---
That NPC broke the 4th wall.
---
Yeah I hear its gonna be challenging. Can't wait to see what happens to the sylvari.
---
Yes it does. I want infusions as rewards for easy content the same as hard content; that’s my entire point.
---
https://www.vabbi.eu/builds/guardian.html
---
Check out the link, there's a lot of info to get a better understanding of the build and your role in a squad. I'm not an expert myself so I don't think I could explain it better than the people who make the site.
---
"Not good to watch" is such a stupid argument on so many levels, I cant believe people STILL try to make it work for them. 
---
For one thing, twitch is at least 70% about the streamer, either you like him/her, or you dont and leave. Twitch isnt a youtube video afterall.
---
For another, gw2 has a very clean combat system. Targetting with just enough action combat elements to make it look good. 
---
Also, the UI in gw2 is very clean, not overloaded with addons or extra skillbars like so many other mmorpgs. Thats especially good for new players because you dont get overwhelmed by the UI while watching the stream.
---
And then theres the broad spectrum of activities in the game itself. Just chatting, fashion wars, fractals, raids, worldbosses, running around in circles on a mount or on foot, wvw zerging, wvw roaming, pvp... you got streamers for everything.
---
If there's ever been a game suited for streaming, its gw2. 
---
Btw... I can watch twitch AND play the game at the same time, shocking, I know. I even sometimes watch a pvp stream while doing raids myself :o
---
I heard nothing about this and it makes me sad
---
Can't say I'll be driving 2 hours to the nearest Quiznos, though.
---
Oh wait, they deliver, lol

Not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need!
---
[Wtf happened here?](https://i.imgur.com/KVDXSLL.png) Must be a record.
---
Unfortunately (for them). a lot of the discussion is around what a shitty company they are.
---
Honestly just wish they'd start working on the technical debt their engine has accumulated over the years.
---
&gt; Raids are not super hard content, again, fractals are harder. If i had a gold for every time a voice in the void or everlasting ally guy is terribad at 100cm i could buy like a 32 slot bag by now... Like seriously when people with raid titles and low ess join my groups i always worry.
---
If you can do raids, you don't automatically can do fractal CMs. Fractal CMs have their own mechanics. However, even if fractals are more demanding than other PvE content, they are definitely not harder than raids. 
---
Your comparsion was like comparing Dhuum with VG. Dhuum definitely is harder, but killing Dhuum doesn't mean you can kill VG as well, especially if you haven't done VG (much) before or don't even know the mechanics. Same with Raids and Fractals. (imo)
---
Sure, it’s better than BDO, but that’s an extreme example. That doesn’t excuse the overpriced mount skins, loot boxes, triple monetized build templates and, lack of inventory space without buying bag slots, bank slots and material storage upgrades. That you can’t get in game. Personally I bought the core game and both xpacs at FULL price. Plus most living world content with USD. Since I left for a few years. Also I bought some account upgrades so I didn’t have to worry about inventory as much and support the game as well. Now they’re expecting me (a raider) to pay for basic features that cost more than a xpac.
---
Both armors are prestigious, I never said 1 is better than the other I just find the raid armor looking better which is subjective obviously as someone who has the wvw skins as well I personally only like wearing the chest pieces and transmuted the others, but that's just me. Anyway whether you dont awe on someone wearing the raid legendary armor, fact is it is still considered a prestigious item. Rarity and prestige may sound similar but are 2 different things.
---
^ the reason why rule 2 exists (no context)
---
TLDR; Anet fucked up yet another promo, this time with Quizno's, to get a code for a mini
---
Quizno's is a fast food chain; you buy a sub and get a code. Only, there are basically no locations open anymore, and those that are, are far away
---
People are memeing the shit out of it to whore karma.
---
I'd like one plz.
---
ha
---
U r bad af, it is easy you just lack in mechanics.
---
This door has been taunting players literally since Beta. It's used for nothing and is mentioned by only one NPC (another redditor explained this further up). Over the years players have furiously drafted up ideas on what the door will eventually turn out to be.
---
Quiznos is a mostly defunct chain of establishments that will take your money and sometimes give you an edible sandwich in exchange. Anet partnered with the seven of them still open around the world to give players in-game items if they visit their locations.
---
lots of people without children ...
---
Tanks
---
Take a look!
---
Definitely not eating that sub on delivery.
---
Oof, I know people who go out FOR Maccas lol. When I'm out and about, I still don't eat Maccas but hey, maybe if you're doing long distance nothing inbetween trips.
---
Comes with the third expansion ...
---
i kinda like it. no joke
---
Depends what you bind, mine I have elite skill. Weapon swap and f1 to ft as that's all I feel the need for.

[ARENA NET] [Robert Gee.9246 posted on 2019-11-07 00:51:10](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/91782/upcoming-changes-to-fall-damage-and-revival):
---
&gt; Hey folks,
---
&gt;
---
&gt;I wanted to pop in today to give you all a preview of some upcoming changes to fall damage and revival that we'll be rolling out in an upcoming balance update.  The quick summary is that we are removing trait functionality that reduces fall damage and increases passive revival speed. 
---
&gt;While fall damage reduction traits were useful when the game first launched we feel that they are currently over-complicating trait descriptions in a post-glider/mount world. Falling damage reduction is already pretty niche and in the past we have added additional functionality to make them more generally useful. However for most of these traits, that bonus functionality eventually became the main reason to take the trait. At this point we felt it just makes more sense to remove the fall damage portion, which leaves some design space if we want to buff these traits in the future.
---
&gt;For revival traits we want to focus more of that power onto active revival rather than simply increasing the speed of "press F to revive".  You may have noticed that we've slowly been removing some of these traits already as was the case with the Tactics rework. We like how revival traits like Necromancer Transfusion and Elementalist Arcane Resurrection actively tap into existing skills and augment them so we added similar functionality to a few other revival traits when we removed the revival speed increase. In addition you'll also see some improvements to skills which revive allies directly.
---
&gt;Here's the list of changes by profession:
---
&gt;**Elementalist**
---
&gt;* Arcane Abatement: Removed fall damage functionality from this trait. Renamed to "Arcane Restoration."
---
&gt;* Glyph of Renewal: Reduced recharge to 90 seconds in all game modes. Lowered cast time from 3.25 seconds to 2 seconds.
---
&gt;* Arcane Resurrection: This trait no longer increases revival speed. Auras granted by this trait are now granted only to the elementalist at the start of a revival attempt rather than at the end. This effect has a 20 second cooldown.
---
&gt;**Engineer**
---
&gt;* Grenadier:  Removed fall damage functionality from this trait. Additionally this trait now casts Lesser Grenade Barrage on your location when using a healing skill.
---
&gt;**Guardian**
---
&gt;* Protectors Impact: Removed fall damage functionality from this trait. Renamed to "Protector's Restoration".
---
&gt;* Signet of Mercy: Reduced recharge to 90 seconds in all game modes. Changed passive effect from granting 180 healing power (216 when traited) to granting 120 concentration (150 when traited).
---
&gt;* Protective Reviver: This trait no longer increases revival speed and no longer grants boons on a successful revival. Fixed skill fact to show correct 3 second duration. Fixed a bug which prevented the recharge of Lesser Shield of Absorption from being affected by Stalwart Defender. Lesser Shield of Absorption now heals nearby allies when it ends. This trait now causes all versions of Shield of Absorption to revive allies by 15% when it detonates.
---
&gt;* Courageous Return: This trait has been reworked and it has been renamed to "Stalwart Courage". It grants the guardian Protection for 3 seconds whenever aegis on the guardian is removed due to blocking an attack.
---
&gt;**Mesmer**
---
&gt;* Descent into Madness: Removed fall damage functionality from this trait. Renamed to "Method of Madness"
---
&gt;* Medic's Feedback: This trait no longer increases revival speed. It now causes Feedback to revive allies inside it by 5% per second.
---
&gt;**Necromancer**
---
&gt;* Terrifying Descent: This trait has been reworked. It has been renamed to "Insidious Disruption". It now causes control effects to inflict torment on foes.
---
&gt;* Signet of Undeath: Reduced recharge to 75 seconds in all game modes. Reduced cast time from 3 seconds to 1.5 seconds. Reduced number of allies revived from 3 to 1. Added additional health cost of 50% of base health to this skill. Increased passive lifeforce gain by 100%.
---
&gt;**Ranger**
---
&gt;* Soften the Fall: Removed fall damage functionality from this trait. Renamed to "Child of Earth"
---
&gt;* Allies' Aid: This trait no longer increases revival speed. Reduced cooldown of this trait from 85 seconds to 60 seconds. Fixed a bug which caused the version of "Search and Rescue!" associated with this trait to be considered a Shout skill instead of a Command.
---
&gt;**Revenant**
---
&gt;* Planar Protection: Removed fall damage functionality from this trait.
---
&gt;**Thief**
---
&gt;* Uncatchable: Removed fall damage functionality from this trait.
---
&gt;**Warrior**
---
&gt;* Peak Performance: Removed fall damage functionality from this trait. Reduced conditional damage bonus from 20% to 15% in PvE and 10% to 7% in competitive modes. Now grants 5% bonus damage baseline in PvE and 3% bonus damage in competitive modes.

---
It comes across as very opinionated.
---
&gt; River can be two or three manned like a mini game without much difficulty.
---
Yeah... that doesn't include bad players. 
---
&gt; Again there is no fucking way you cant manage to find 1 or 2 people, practise a while and just do it unless you plain refuse to learn basic mechanics.
---
Funnily I never ever saw a river practice group in lfg, not even within release week. 
---
&gt; Not to mention buying river costs 4-10g max, and you get part of that from the raid rewards. 
---
I don't think we should start talking about buying raids. I mean it's about effort/reward, not about the fastest way. Otherwise you coud also pay your comi in WvW to get a participation slot, so you don't even have to conquere a canp every 10 minutes. 
---
&gt; Not being able to learn how to do river is more of a skill than being able to learn things after some practise.
---
Practicing, getting better etc. are too much details for the original question. Earlier we said (I did) that the person is alone and only uses lfg to find groups. At this point you see river only groups very rarely in lfg. Most groups want to do the full wing or everything except Dhuum. So even if you learn how to do river, it's still rare to find a group (and be successfull) -&gt; get an LI at the end of the week. On the other hand it's not only you, there are 9 other players  and having a player in your group who can solo it, is really uncommon. And it's not only river, it's all bosses. Even if you can do all of them perfectly (at this point keep in mind that we originally talk about bad players), your whole group has to have that skill too. And to be fair, 0-50 LI groups either quit the raid after x tries without a kill or need very long / many tries to kill one boss.
---
Can I get a code? Or 2 one for my wife as well &lt;3

Interesting

Yelling at anet because Quiznos is barely hanging by a thread and can’t pull a promotional if they wanted to?  Cool!
---
Open World: Doesn't really matter as long you join people at melee range when needed.
---
Fractals: Decent
---
Raids: If party composition still allows, Druid was meta last patch notes.
---
WvW: Good at ganking people. Can't say much for zerg fights. Its a decent "all-rounder" for roaming, you never miss anything but don't feel strong either.
---
PvP: Boonbeast was the top meta duelist a few patch notes ago. Got nerfed. Still usable but no longer meta. Power Soulbeast/Core Rangers has always being a good way to kill new players and still usable at higher ranks. Druid is a meme on SPvP tough... unless you are playing at your guilds pvp-inside tournament.
---
They actually dont even do that in every country
---
Love people who think they are cultured or educated. Then lumping a whole country as uneducated because of some personal bais.
---
&gt; he said that ranger class is almost dead on comparison of other classes
---
When did he play ranger the last time, 2013?
---
NBA 2K series since 2K18.
---
Dafuq... is wrong with you people...
---
&gt;Peak Performance: Removed fall damage functionality from this trait. Reduced conditional damage bonus from 20% to 15% in PvE and 10% to 7% in competitive modes. Now grants 5% bonus damage baseline in PvE and 3% bonus damage in competitive modes.
---
5% Warrior damage buff. POGGERS
---
That happened a long time ago.
---
Runes of Snowfall no longer reduce fall damage by 25%.
---
SHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Well?
---
&gt; Maybe it could return just for PvE as part of a mastery,
---
I have a strong feeling this is the plan.
---
It is hard, was even harder sinve anet nerfed it twice.
---
If you are desperate, get a minionmancer. a much better choice than investing in tanky stats.
---
Ah! Aw, dang. Thank you for updating me, it's appreciated! :)
---
I havn't played in many years, but this gave me a good laugh.
---
None of those places are really meant to rely on fall damage reduction. In most of those cases they allowed gimmicks like skipping content or breaking out of maps by climbing over walls and surviving falls never meant to be survived. 
---
The only spots where fall damage reduction can actually be needed are some JPs, to avoid getting one-shotted by an enemy after a fall, or falling to one's death and having to come back from a waypoint way too far. For those the fall damage reduction could return as part of a Mastery, so it won't affect WvW and PvP.
---
I don't normally reddit so I don't know if people following get notifications when I edit the post or respond, but I just posted 3 sets of codes (60 total).  I'll add more later because I wasn't sure how this would work.  Hope you guys enjoy!
---
If you don't get one now, don't worry, I have more.  And if you PM me I might be able to get you one directly, depending on how busy I am. 
---
But please don't spam my inbox.  Thank you!
---
While I see the idea, I strongly disagree that fall damage reduction needs to be removed in competitive game modes. Gliding and mount use makes PvE damage reduction redundant but in competitive modes, having a reduction of damage from falling out of a tower or keep wall is necessary because of the way this game adds damage from falling. If they are serious about removing said traits, they should look at the calculation and height thresholds in addition to the metrics already being looked at.
---
Now that I think about it, one of the new masteries will be related to the Raven spirit.
---
Ravens fly.
---
set 2, 96664M-R1HLF ... taken. Thank you.
---
Anet_CMC just said in the PvP Discord those changes don't have PvP splits yet. 
---
SOme of these will need some, like the new Courageous Return basically give Support FB a shit ton of Protection for free. It can't stay that way.
---
Access to corrupt is kind of limited to a few classes though.
---
Remove Repair next please. Pointless mechanic that's just annoying.
---
set 3: 411V9T-7PWSV ...
---
and a friend:  
---
set 3: 6JJPLT-DP3R6 ...
---
You mean like the majority of infusions?
---
Confetti infusion drops from a boss that literally doesn't fight back. Hardcore or casual, you've just got to be lucky.
---
It's okay to be casual. But it's okay to have rewards that are difficult to obtain too.
---
I wandered aimlessly around the maps for xp, not really absorbing anything I was seeing. At 56, I boosted to 80 via tomes.
---
I really don't want to keep this char afterwards. Didn't realize until around 30 that guardian isn't my kinda thing.
---
Character is only a few days old. Birthday bonus wouldn't be significant enough to keep. Already got raptor before 80 thanks to help from a friend.
---
Will hit you up once I get ingame if I remember to. Thanks.
---
Well, I got bad news for you...
---
Anet's marketing is actually ran by a bunch of headless monkeys.
---
Terrifying Descent: This trait has been reworked. It has been renamed to "Insidious Disruption". It now causes control effects to inflict torment on foes.
---
Does this mean chill will cause torment? Since it is a control effect.
---
Rushed. Oof.
---
After careful analysis of history, I have come to one conclusion.
---
 
---
Everyone sucks... but it doesn't have to stay that way. In fact, it's not supposed to stay that way.
---
Why the hell is the necro signet the only one to get a built in negative? They constantly say it adds flavor, but I dont see other classes constantly getting negative effects tied to their skills.
---
Redeemed 733H3F-243PQ-FVS7-PLC-VDKTSPK, thanks!
---
(Set one, bottom right corner)
---
The new trait for more torment sounds great for condition builds, it could even be better than plague sending. 
---
Feels like with the sacrifice on the signet now it should be change to a corruption skill. Also it would just be more enticing to keep the signet to a passive and I wonder how it would interact with "signets of suffering" trait. Maybe a lesser health sacrifice?
---
I managed to redeem
---
9PP18X-GXRX3-CTJK-DJ97GWDSQ4
---
Thanks OP.
---
&gt; Disagree here. This is maybe one of the best systems Gw2 came up with, it benefits all 3 parties. ANet curbs gold sellers, people who play less and have money can keep up with others, people who play more and want to save real money can get anything off the gemstore they want. WoW only went halfway by selling subs for ingame gold, but theres no other way to cash out for their $25 mount skins and whatnot
---
I'm not fully sure if I understood what you ment, but you can use wow tokens to buy anything from blizzards game store, 1 token gives you 13€ /$ that you can put into battlenet balance and use that to buy mounts, race change or another game on the store
---
Just a heads-up, NCSOFT closed the marketing "department" at ArenaNet. It's all handled by NCSOFT now.
---
You know, the guys who did Tyria Taxi.
---
You really shouldn't. Many of them are really amazing people.
---
Well all mounts are somewhat easy to get except beetle which is a bit of a step by step process to get and may be waaaaaaay harder for you due to lack of experience with expansions and being lvl 80.

---
Yes, there's an NPC in Desert Highlands that tells you the tunnel is collapsed and inaccessible, there's just to much debris for anyone to remove and reopen it...and they tell you to not even try to enter as those that have tried died doing so.
---
The hero we don't deserve!
---
I like this, thumbs up.
---
Holy shit thank you so much for articulating why I've hated all these goddamn nerfs to necro [almost] more than the torture they inflict on chronos patch after patch...
---
FUCK FLAVOUR, I'm so sick of that bs excuse for every nerf and change they hide behind it
---
I dont fond it vert usefull but maybe other will so upvote :o
---
Wow, did not expect that to work, thank you so much for posting the codes as text! I got  433T48-NK9P7-HVRV-36L-H86FKVX if you want to remove it and the ones below it did not work.
---
Dude, it would be an *indirect buff to chrono*! How DARE you!
---
I mean, I guess League of Legends is getting worse and worse for most of the playerbase so it's not too surprising more and more people are leaving. As for Warframe, well, it's essentially a sci-fi "MMORPG" (or at least plays quite similar to one) and GW2 is a wholly more fantasy-based MMORPG so I guess they can compliment each other.
---
Also, prior knowledge of both Warframe and League of Legends makes learning GW2 a cruise. It's like, Precision is Crit Chance, present in most games, Ferocity is Crit Damage, more prominent in Warframe, Condition is essentially Status exclusively from Warframe, GW2's combat is similar to Warframe, positioning in combat is closer to League of Legends (since Warframe you essentially have borderline infinite mobility anyway).
---
Makes sense players who've played both League of Legends and Warframe would naturally enjoy GW2.
---
"Industry-leading efforts in detail and vibrance"? Man, you really had to reach to find things to put in your bullet list, didn't you?
---
you didnt even use the active part of peak performance with banner war, thats why its a full dmg buff in that case
---
Just added more.  I'm done for the night so there probably won't be any updates until at least 16 hours later...
---
Sub sandwich chain... Sort of like Little King's...
---
For someone who doesn't understand the meaning of the word "disabuse" I'm not surprised at your lack of ability to form a cogent argument. Either spending a long time doing a low skill task is hard or it's not. You can't say losing your way to PvP armors or afk-pip-farming your way to WvW armors is easy and then turn around to say earning 10k gold is hard when you can do a dozen low skill tasks a day to rack up 10 or more easy gold a day on just 1 paid account.
---
My qualifier for buying raids was "if you have the resources". If you have the resources, you can, for example, buy another 4 more alt accounts, do your dailies, a Teq kill and a couple of high yield meta-events on just 1 account every single day and you'll get at least:  
---
\- 10 liquid gold from the dailies
---
\- 10 liquid gold from the teq kill
---
\- 150 Mystic Coins you can sell per month
---
10k gold is a lot of gold to earn, yes. It takes a long time to earn that, no doubt. But you need to make up your mind what's "hard" or you're just contradicting yourself.
---
RIP jumping from atop a cliff and smashing head first into a group of people with the Warrior fall damage trait I guess.WvW will never feel as fun without it. :  (
---
Just 4500 km next to my flat.
---
They probably mean hard control effects ( stun daze launch knockback, etc )
---
It's like Pickleman's
---
Well I'm sure you know of Little King's then.
---
You are doing the lord's work, thanks so much. Redeemed DCC7QM-LCT89-MNX7-91W-4S8FXHJ from set 6.
---
anet AGAIN removing skills/traits from game... :DDDD you have already mmo with LEAST skills to chose from and you have balls to actualy removing some of them... just wow.
---
Haha yeah I'm apparently like the opposite here and thought they were still a major chain, but when I went to search for ones near me there aren't any in my city anymore.
---
&gt; What most likely happen is this for a person who never played gw2. They buy the sandwich and wonder what the code is for. So they go back to the register and say “hey what’s this code for?” The person at the register will say “the code is for a free gw2 10 slot back and mini, and experience boosters if you never played the game, it’s free. Check it out on google.” 
---
What IN FACT most likely to happen is that the person buying a sandwich either throws that stuff right away, or asks the clerk what that code is for, and get's the answer "A promotion we're currently running. It's for a game or something. Dunno."
---
[citation needed]
---
Aaand what is Little King's?
---
Sorry, but you're bringing up one name after another of stuff people don't know.
---
Yeah, you could have done that or the 5 might on healskill, but didnt rly matter as all these traits are bad, if you have signet of might
---
you never needed these traits though, for neither of the skips. Just dodge forward instead of jumping for portal.
---
!remindme 3h
---
Time to log out
---
:-D  and it keeps on going \*g\*
---
You’re really making me dig deep here man! :P
---
Jersey Mikes!
---
Feel free to use it in open world! The range is nice for bounty dailies in PoF maps tbh. Plus LB4 is a nice CC for break bars. My Soulbeast is WvW only so I don’t even bother to switch out from the low dps Marauder stats in open world heh.
---
I follow that but really wish there were more instances of area design that allowed for these instances before this whole credence came in that the trait is too niche.  The rarity is in the environment, not the application
---
It seems to me there's at *least* one race that's *really* good at tunnels and not all of them hate us.
---
You’re bad.

[removed]
---
Wizard's folly would be amazing with the floating tower and all

&lt;3
---
mmm... reminds me of us at sea facing jq hod.
---
Yeah. This is a nerf to the chrono build I use to port people to the Not So Secret JP goggles and drop down to rez and port back if they don't make the jump. A bit sad.
---
Ooh, good to know that Shortbows work. I might give those a shot, thank you for that. :D
---
Welcome aboard!
---
Fair word of warning; reddit isn't exactly the same atmosphere as in-game, currently everyone is flipping out over build templates and another failed promo. The less time you spend on the subreddit, the more enjoyment you'll get from the game overall lol
---
Ah, that's good to know. Thanks for linking that build, I'll have to look into it when I'm home. :) 
---
World boss and event farming was my main plan for this toon. Another helpful commenter said to try Shortbows, so I'll certainly do both. :D
---
metric &gt; imperial
---
**Thank you so much!**

Would a barrier allow the chrono to still jump down?

One way to get around that is to add GW2Clipboard to the Lauchbuddy Addon Manager
---
So about that WvW restructure.....
---
Its also really counter intuitive that the dodge works.  When you dodge off the ledge you fall faster (or at least it looks like you do?), and as a result take less fall damage?  What?
---
No fapping for you, sir!
---
Well I'm either extremely unlucky or they've seemingly been all redeemed. Tried probably 30 of them from the last batches uploaded.
---
I support removing the fall damage from the traits because it would be a hassle to switch to those traits only in the niche cases where it would be useful, *but* they also need to baseline those fall damage decreases, for those cases where it *was* handy, like in JPs and the Mad King fight.

I just stumbled upon this stream. Who watches stuff like that. Those Necros are just auto-spamming their AoE's and minions :D
---
In GW1, Urgoz Waren parties had a 1hp BiP, as long as you're @1hp, you spam BiP without the health cost per cast. 
---
I mainly ran that and being glass but surviving while supporting was intense.
---
 ~~JFFBLJ-WVFQ9-XL3J-26J-PJ6VGKH~~ 
---
Thank you so much!
---
Game client disconnected for inactivity lol
---
This is bad for WvW. I always used those traits in many closed instances too. Fall damage reduction was fine.
---
Gem prices suck and besides that, all this game has to offer is working towards gold to buy overly expensive materials and skins. Take that away and you have little left. Too many dead areas of the game haven't been addressed or balanced either.
---
I've also pointed out before the problem with free to play or pay once MMOs and that is highlighted in GW2 so well. Much of the core content of the game has not been fixed of the plethora of bugs because it doesn't earn money and the lack of originally included features is being put in much later at a premium. Much of the content creation goes back into the gem store because of those buying in the gem store. It isn't about supporting them either because that kind of support (in the gem store) only benefits a few. For the sheer effort needed to look good in GW2 is undermined by one person dropping 1200 gems on an outfit these days.
---
Looking back, GW1 and 2 was appealing because it was a pay once alternative to things like WoW, but if you really got into it it becomes rather expensive and for those who didn't pay (coz optional, apparently), they had to grind their ass off 10,000 times more than anyone who's not loaded enough to dump crazy amounts on the gem store each month. It's almost a form of punishment. Much of the content isn't story or community interaction, it's grinding for cosmetic rewards. The reason prices for free content is so high is because it's a buffer.
---
I hated the idea of MMOs under subscriptions but for all the years I've played GW2, it's made me realise how bad the handling is of content when content is funded by a minority spending huge sums in the gem store. Now people may not like the hear that and accept that, but it is true.
---
Sadly there doesn't seem to be a decent MMO these days with *only* a subscription and no cash store.
---
Can i get one of those fancy blast finisher on necro too? 
---
*Note: i know staff4 is blast finisher but is it actually usable.
---
King of the jungle meta, I havent heard it called that for years lol.
---
Anything below 10k can just be mitigated by a fb when he has tomes active. This amplifies with more numbers of fb and dedicated healers like heal tempest in zergs.
---
&gt; Descent into Madness: Removed fall damage functionality from this trait. Renamed to "Method of Madness"   
---

**Levelling**
---
\- Events/things to do and notifications/daily tasks are all listed on the top right hand corner of the screen. Yellow hearts are just something to do, not required you should be looking for events indicated by an orange circle on the map/minimap. Events labelled (group events) on the right side of the screen
---
\- Enjoy the game, the grind is very very minimal to max level.
---
\- There are three main damage sources/things to look out for. Direct damage, Condition damage, CC (Crowd control). Direct damage simply is like getting hit by a physical attack. Condition damage is when negative statuses are applied to you on above the right hand side of your bar (They are coloured red). Crowd control is simply getting anything that inhibits your ability to execute skills/movement such as stuns/pulls/knockback/immobilize/daze etc. Some open world mobs have crowd control but are generally telegraphed attacks by an biddable cue and charge animation.
---
 **Skills**
---
\- You have two sets of abilities on your skill bar split in the middle by your health bar which is a red circle in the middle-bottom of the UI. Left side skills (default 1-5) are your weapon skills. Right hand side are utility skills that you learn from spending HERO points obtained at certain levels or by completing hero challenges around a map. These range from simply channelling at a specific location to killing a certain "boss".
---
\- Do not neglect your dodge roll (V or double tap in any direction). it is essential to good play, but also do not neglect simply walking out of the way. Please note MANY people unbind double tap for evade in the settings (ESC) due to nudging forward during jumping puzzles.
---
\- You will NOT unlock all skills at early level, nor will you unlock all profession/class skills at a low level. E.G If you were to pick elementalist, you will not be able to use all four attunements until a bit later.
---
\- SOME classes  (elementalist and engineer) are unable to wield a weapon swap. Default weapon swap I believe is the (\~ key). At low level, this will also not be unlocked. Weapon swap has a cooldown and will swap to your other weapon set which (If using different weapons will give you different weapon skills (skills 1-5 by default). 
---
\- There are two main things to train when you level. **Specialisations also known as TRAITS (generally passive bonuses)** and **Utility skills (generally active skills, default skills 6-0).** You will eventually unlock specialisations you can equip up to three of these at max level (80). The first being unlocked at level 21. Both utility and specialisation cost HERO points to unlock that are obtained as previously mentioned.
---
\- Utility skills can be slotted in any order on the skill bar (6-0). There are multiple utility skill lines depending on your class. Training a utility skill line to the end will unlock an elite skill. Elite skills can ONLY be slotted once level 31.
---
**Equipment** 
---
\- Gear with +power should be priority, secondary stats to look for probably +precision +ferocity. Gear with +Condition damage probably isn't worth it early game.
---
\- Press H for your hero tab, you will be able to access both the "equipment" tab and "wardrobe" tab. Equipment will be where you check your gear. You will have 6 armor slots: 
---
6x armor slots (Head, shoulder, chest, gloves, leggings and boots) - located on the left side of the menu
---
The rest:  
---
1x backpiece slot  
---
2x ring slots  
---
2x accessory slots  
---
1x amulet slot.  
---
2x weapon slots (or one large weapon such as a greatsword/staff)
---
are located on the right bottom side of the menu, you CAN equip things in each slot from the beginning but are unlikely to find good gear to slot in them, always be on the lookout
---
\-  There are armor and weapon upgrades called runes and sigils respectively. Runes go into armor and provide set bonuses. At low level, these set bonuses will be limited to (2). E.G +10 power +5% boon duration for having two of the same rune. At level 60+ you will obtain runes that give set bonuses up to (6), I.E your entire armor. Sigils are limited to weapons only one sigil per weapon, or two sigils on a single large weapon (E.G greatsword/staff).
---
\- 
---
**Quality of life**  
---
\- Many materials are able to be stored directly from your inventory to your bank (Crafting materials), you can do this by pressing the gear on the top right of the inventory menu and depositing all crafting materials.
---
\- There are many trash gear drops in this game, you level to 80 fast so don't worry just wear what's got the best stats and salvage the rest. Salvage kits will salvage a piece of gear down into crafting materials that you can then store in the bank from your inventory as stated in the above point. If you do not do this, your minimal inventory space will fill very quickly. Salvage kits can be purchased for a small sum at a standard merchant (usually with a stack of coins above their head or on the minimap). ***Note: salvage kits are only unlocked at a later level***
---
\- By going into settings (ESC) you are able to toggle instant cast abilites for AoE and visual things like field of view. For best performance I suggest turning down shadows and number&amp;quality of players + player models to medium. I suggest also increasing field of view. You CAN zoom out quite far in this game and it helps awareness if that's your thing.
---
It would be cool to add another core tyria mastery for it or something
---

*We're going north! TO VABBI!*
---
That's because gw2 is a cooperative mmo.

As long as you stay out of public raids.
---
Most other mmos are compete against everyone including your team in dps HPs or whatever.
---
What os he trying to do? I dont quite get it and he has a DC
---
The event completed and the recipe was unlocked at the LA mystic forge.
---
Allegedly
---
It's all about the distance that you fall, not the speed
---
Personally I'd make Warhorn 4 a blast and Staff Marks have a second ability to manually trigger them.  
---
So yes, the answer is yes you should.
---
Hold up, you got a source for the "new raids/fractals are comming" claim?
---
yeah but I'm saying look at the speed at which your character falls. Maybe its my eyes playing tricks on me?  It always looks like I fall faster when I dodge off a cliff rather than jump.  As in I hit the ground faster.
---
Condi stats work better on longer fights when the enemy has lots of HP (eg. Raids), it’s the nature of condi stats to do damage over time. Power stats on the other hand burst the damage up front, so it’s suitable for open world and fractals. 
---
My point is Shortbow will work, but don’t be surprised on how it’ll take longer to kill things while leveling. 
---
Double Shortbow Soulbeast is perhaps the easiest yet effective PvE build in the game. Power Soulbeast is nothing to scoff at either, it deals tremendous spike damage. As for me, warrior is more my calling heh.
---
Heal scourge will be just fine, they mostly removed the increased res speed when pressing F traits. 
---
The passive resing of necro is still there with well and traited shroud fear skill. The instant res signet was slightly nerfed in impact, but the CD is shorter now and grants a welcome increase in life force generation. You can probably mitigate the health cost with a well placed barrier anyway.
---
Crafting if you have the gold.
---
What about elixir R? They are removing press-F-to-revive speed increases, not removing passively resing skills. 
---
They even added this sort of res functionality to Mesmer bubble, so I’m not sure they really forgot about Elixir R. Just didn’t need to change it
---
Having issues maxing out chef due to not having access to the right vendors got it to 250 atm
---
Yeah, my point was pretty clear and I think everyone is able to understand what I meant. I'm not sorry for you being too nitpicky about this and making a drama out of one tiny aspect of my original comment.
---
I wrote a decent write up on the viabilities in the different submodes of the game, hope you can check it out:
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dplays/can_i_play_ranger_with_bow_only/
---
Everything got their cooldowns cut, cast times reduced, signets receive a buff to passive effects. And yet for 7 years now "Toss elixir R" can get reflected, body-blocked by enemies with Aegis or block and in general pales to other professions with their insta-res AoE ress abilities with no counters.
---
I hate this. It reduces flavor, new player experience and cuts these niche but still useful traits (which can be switched anytime anyway), just for some stupid 'too much text' reason, when there are many tooltips much much bigger than that. 
---
What about WvW? What about JPs where you want to have a failsafe? What about story instances, or dungeons?
---
The trick is to not jump at all, but simply dodge off the platform at the right angle(and while you are at full HP)
---
Just yesterday a german company was fined 14,5 million
---
&gt; Engineer
---
&gt;    Grenadier: Removed fall damage functionality from this trait. Additionally this trait now casts "on your location when using a healing skill.
---
So, basically you remove functionality from a profession that really could use a boost, while making healing me potentially putting me into combat?
---
Also, that "Lesser Grenade Barrage" will only be useful at all if it does have a low cooldown. The 25s from the regular one would not be far too long. With 25s you couldn't rely on that barrage, while you could always rely on the falling damage reduction and the barrage resulting from falling damage. Sure, there was a cooldown on that too, but you typically don't fall as often as you heal and you can control falling a lot more than when you got to heal.
---
None of them should be impossible without the trait though
---
Changes for the sake of changing again. Can't they put their effort into something useful?
---
Also I really hope that the ICD of Signet of Mercy stays high in PvP, it is already a key skill.
---
You didn't read my post properly...
---
Each piece of legendary gear would **make your gear break faster** unless you had a full set equipped.
---
WvW is probably your fastest method. Depending on your server.  Other than that, crafting. Typing /wiki in the game should tell you most things and [gw2crafts.net](https://gw2crafts.net) also helps.
---
this. this wins. I don’t know what. but it won.
---
I know you have good intentions, but scraper-bots usually grab the plain text codes here.
---
It’s not about content but more about relevance. I want to one day be at a point where I am leveling and experiencing everything same time as everyone else, not forever behind. Right now I just play to catch up and although it’s fun, I just wanta be same level and experiencing content AS it’s released.
---
You definitely can use staff. I personally play staff tempest in open world. For gear, I personally use a zerker/marauder mix (more zerker than marauder, the marauder is both for the vitality and the slight precision boost) with strength runes. Going full zerker (or a zerker/assassin combo for precision) is viable too if you're comfortable with the low health. Strength runes focus on +power and might duration, w a damage buff when youre under the effect of might, and since tempest grants a lot of might just naturally (weaver and core ele also do but to a lesser extent), I find those a good fit for open world content. 
---
I personally use fire/air/tempest for my traits, arcane/air/tempest would definitely also be good, maybe also fire/arcane/tempest as well. I play a fresh air build (the trait in the air traitline) that uses lots of air overloads, but that's more my personal playstyle, there's lots of other options. (For all of these, sub in weaver for tempest if you'd rather play that.)
---
For survivability, there are some traits you could take (like lesser lava font in the fire traitline which gives you a very strong downstate, or one in the arcane traitline that gives you an arcane shield when you're struck with low health), there's also utility skills like arcane shield which has 3 blocks, and you have easy access to healing from water (water staff 3 + 5, overload water if you're tempest). Weapon skills might also include blocks/evades, for example on staff you'll have an evade, burning retreat (fire 4). 
---
Staff has the added benefit of range. Scepter and your choice of offhand (dagger, focus, warhorn) would also have this benefit. I prefer the skills available on staff personally, but scepter/whatever tends to do better damage I think. Ultimately up to you what to play.
---
Thanks guys! Appreciate the really fast responses! Feels good to see this community is still active! Maybe I'll invest in one of these areas for future use!  Loving the game still and how to see this community still kicking!
---
I see a few in the Silverwastes too. Have been the same two accounts  the last few months when I do my weekly key farm run.
---
I say this is an ideal time for them to make a new PvE mastery line.  Call it Tyrian Explorer or such.  Lower fall damage by 25% baseline (so put it to 75% of what it currently is with no traits or such), then have some masteries that do things like "Take 1/3 less damage when falling." (this puts you at 50% of our current, AKA what the traits did), "X% chance to gain an extra strike when gathering from resource nodes."  "Can view resource nodes on the world map and/or have specific resource nodes highlighted." (AKA you could have all onion nodes get a red circle around them, or change the colour of the icon, stuff like that).  And the final one they could, I dunno, give +25% movement speed when out of combat, just a thought.
---
I checked a rather recent benchmark and it indeed looks very weird that it works... Well another buff in the basket of Power Banner when the self-stun is not too much of an issue I guess :p
---
I am now a God, your God. I deserve this.
---
I think you missed my two points:
---
Using the term (absolute) nonsense is not very polite and makes the discussion less civil. At least you dropped the absolute but you are still using nonsense. And for some the new system in its current implementation is worse than the old system.
---
I feel very little sympathy for BG. The rest of the servers have all experienced this for years. It sucks.
---
There's the Royal Terrace (DR), Noble's Folly (VB), Airship (Gandarran), Lava Lounge (Ember Bay),  PvP &amp; WvW passes (Though the PvP pass isn't paid)  
---
Then there's the one to rule them all... Mistlock
---
ay, thanks for the info!!
---
they should remade necro minions so shit like afk farming wont be possible. Fuck afk farmers
---
Hello again, two more questions
---
1. What are these 'infusion' things?
---
   1. Is it better to use an Artificer to refine the simple ones up into higher tiers or use the FoTM golem vendor?
---
   2. The Metabattle build I use says i should get 'mighty +5 agony infusions' on all the slots for my power necro, is this correct?
---
   3. I tend to stay away from raids/fractals because I get 240-280 ping playing from Australia and it puts me at a constant disadvantage no matter how good my gear gets and disincentivizes me from getting better gear. 
---
2. How can I improve my high ping to the NA servers?
---
   1. Would the connection to EU be more or less laggy?
---
   2. Do any VPNs tend to work?
---
   3. Is there ever going to be a server on my side of the world?
---
   4. Should and how do I do traceroutes and what not to the NA servers?
---
Why mention complaining?
---
&gt; Just perennially unhappy people whose only objective is to make those around them unhappy as well.
---
This is why I wish the mods would do something. I'm okay with people being upset but when all they do is complain, over and over and over never ending maybe its time to give them a time out or something.
---
People already forgot ncsoft took over marketing after lay offs :)
---
I'm convinced a higher up just wanted some free food from Quiznos , lol. Probably thought they could get Quiznos to cater some free lunches for the staff.
---
buy PoF you will get HoT for free. if you are into story buy season 2 of the living world for gems (buy gems directly for money or farm gold to convert it into gems), Season 3 is good even if you dont care about the story as it gives you easy end game gear. Season 4 will give you 2 extra mounts, and some good places to farm gold.
---
So PoF, then if you are the story guy, season 2, and 3 and 4 play in this order:  personal story, season 2, HoT, season 3, PoF, season 4, season 5 (live right now - you will get it for free if you made an account already)  
---
If you dont care about story, get PoF, play it to get mounts, buy season 4 for gold, or season 3 for gear (or both at the same time)
---
That's my problem as well. Each one on their own isn't really a big deal if monetized even if it was more than one, but there are just so many systems in this game that designed to get you to spend more, and usually the best avenue to upgrade these systems to and acceptable level is to spend all of your time grinding gold for gems. 
---
Again, not a big deal if it was just 2 (or perhaps even 3) of them, but its MOST of the systems.
---
that streamer tries to get the attention of Anet GMs, so they ban this afk farming spot/the afk farmer that is usually there. He has been trying to post his streams here many times before in order to raise attention/drama
---
Thanks mate! I got one CQQBPV-6B64J-X7HF-BTS-DCMJTLN. I dont' think there are many left, if any, at this point. I tried the ones from /u/WulfyZef's list and even fixed the dodgy/broken ones. The one I redeemed was one that the screen--&gt;text tool had gotten wrong. I started at set 8 and worked my way down. The one I got was in set 5 if that helps other people know where to start targeting.
---
The npc is a cheap excuse added late in development to justify forgetting to open the door when they saw that we all remembered about it before release and they didn't. Adding an npc dialog is probably easier than changing the gate to open only for PoF owners.
---
I know it could also be a real design decision but I have a hard time believing it, as it's so much less satisfying than opening a door that was there waiting since release and much more players would see the open door than the random npc dialog. Also why have npcs guarding the gate in Ascalon side if the path is blocked anyway ?
---
That sounds like a bug that can be mitigated When you die a piece of your armor is selected to take damage. 1 /7 or maybe its 2/7 who knows if the damage is say -400 so it selects your legendary shoulders for -400 damage then the shoulders just adds 0 value multiple to the damage received. your shoulder takes the hit but takes 0 damage.
---
Since I'm neither the streamer nor have I ever posted stuff like this before, I'd be glad if you could provide some kind of proves to your claim. Please link the according reddit threads here.

No, the screenshot function is 100% free. Just press Print

If you have both HoT and the griffon unlocked, you should go do the griffon adventures in all PoF maps. 
---
Gold times rewards with  little less than an XP bar for little time investment, and there are two adventures per each of the five maps. There are a couple more in LS4 too.
---
If you have the skyscale unlocked, you can also go to Jahai bluffs, start from Yatendi village, and eat up all the volatile magic orbs in the air around the map. This is 2-3 levels.
---
If you have both HoT and the griffon unlocked, you should go do the griffon adventures in all PoF maps.
---
why? somebody been sayin somethin about her?
---
I'm guessing none of their balance team even knows about WvW and the fact that people use falling damage traits there.
---
while gliders and mounts invalidate fall damage to some degree, they are not usable in instances such as dungeons, fractals, and raids, as well as pvp and wvw.
---
not that anet is going to stop the change, at this point, just my 2 cents
---
this meme is so old my body is now decayed...
---
most ppl here be like: oh hehe, so true, huehuehue lmao I caaant
---
Have I mentioned how I hate this subreddit?
---
Soooo they nerfed most of the traits instead of reworking them, making them even more useless than they were (for the most part, they had some niche uses in jps / wvw)? My brain is trying to understand but an error keeps popping up.
---
Thats actually a good point. I guess mystic things actually doesnt exist in our dimension yada yada, but mechanics does feel very similar.
---
there's still no point in deleting it, if you want to make another char then fine just do that but atleast keep this 80 so you don't have to level another in the future
---
Your colouring is way to intense yo 😎
---
Why can they simply walk through your bomb and kill you, yet its impossible for you to bomb them? 
---
If bombs arent as threatening you move around, single target focus and eventually one side has slightly better bombs, focus or sustain to out pressure the enemy. This leads to either space, momentum or advantage in cooldowns.
---
It also allows certain high spike classes to be played in the hopes of catching someone off guard or out of position, because they have sufficient supports and active defenses to be reliably played. I'm fine with those things.
---
So rather than politely pointing this out... everyone just spam-downvotes the person? How nice. 
---
And no, I definitely did use the search function. I've read pretty much every thread about "longbows" from the last 12 months, but I didn't feel like any of the responses really answered my actual question.
---
&gt;This thread is dedicated to questions that you've never really felt the need to start a thread for, but would still like to see answered/discussed.
---
An individual post is much more likely to get attention than a single comment in a giant question thread, and the sub wouldn't have a "Question" flair if you weren't allowed / meant / able / whatever to ask questions in posts. :) 
---
It's essentially just toxicity and making noobs feel bad about asking questions for no good reason.
---
He will fit right in then judging by the colouring of his game :)

thanks for this comment, I agree completely. But we will get downvoted by people who dont want to admit that because they paid lots of gold for it. Vip areas are suppose to load fast, thats their point. You leave your character there and want to log in next day as fast as possible to do daily, buy gems when you heard about some news from anet and you know gem price will rise hard. Or you are playing and want to visit the bank or tp, you dont want big loading times.   
---
Mistlock is like the most popular club in the town. Everyone heard of it and lots of people want to get in there, even if they would need to wait few hours in queue. They would waste most of their evening just to be able to say, yes I am inside, I am cool like all these other people.  
---
In other words people who use mistlock are insecure of themselfs. They need to be with large crowd to feel safe and happy. They are not confident and proud of themselfs, for who they are. Its like all these people who need to buy Iphone as they dont want to be the only person in their school/work who dont have it. They are afraid people will make fun of them. They even know these phones are overpriced shit, but the place among sheep flock is too comfy to past on.  
---
Live your life people, choose what you really want , not what other say is good. Dont be blind sheep, be a wolf, even it it would need to be lonely wolf.
---
Maybe just lower fall damage now in line with what the trait would have given.
---
&gt; that are so good nobody will ever consider keeping them 
---
Chak Egg Sac for 250 KP. :D
---
Inb4 Anet bans all of us for RMT, I would like one too!
---
I really dislike this change. Fall damage reduction is useful in every game mode that bans gliders / mounts. Removing these traits punishes creative gameplay and makes a lot of activities more frustrating.
---
I also want to keep my warrior fall CC opener, dammit.
---
"^this" 
---
woow you are so bright, how can i compare to that wisdom???
---
I do, but don't you have anything better, more purposeful thing to do but complain about how I spend my time? hm?
---
Depends. Some of them are onetrick pony (like me) others just horribly bad and some are way above you. Its quite rare to find exactly the same level of skill as you are.
---
And PvP, very toxic :s WvW isn't so bad, that's just personal experience though
---
Read where I said we "were" :P
---
Cause engi we usually get ignored or nerfed as always mandatory link to still relevant video.
---
https://youtu.be/6q3em9s5I4c
---
Ahaha
---
??? just cleave the one near the boss and let the other 3 merge at the same time, kill them during protect and it's entirely free
---
In Open World you can play whaveter you want. Just have fun, don't mind others.
---
In PvP — everything is good if you can kill people and people have troubles to kill you.
---
Fractals — people expect you to play meta build and be efficient. Longbow isn't the most efficient weapon for ranger. Keep in mind that people don't play ranged in fractals. Everything is melee, because your supports can't heal you and give you boons if you're too far. e.g. Heal Firebrand can't heal someone who's behind him.
---
I've been replaying Nightfall lately and whenever I see her I think of this video. It's an accurate enough summary of the campaign.
---
That was called necro battery I early days but later on you could also BiP (blood is power) with para battery really effective too.
---
Good times when games took team coordination
---
&gt; making healing potentially putting the player into combat? Imagine you are running from someone through mobs of other things you are not in combat with yet, trying hard to get ooc and not hitting anything else, you have to heal yourself but no, you can't, because otherwise you will get hits and will never get ooc. That's counterproductive.
---
Warrior's Reckless Dodge is a minor trait (so, impossible to opt out of) in an almost mandatory traitline that makes getting ooc a pain as well: oh, you want to dodge that attack that will keep you in combat longer? Too bad there are mobs around and the hit from your dodge will keep in combat anyways :)
---
You get used to it.
---
That would be the usual, but in that specific track, if you boost in other places, you'll either get off track or hit a pumpkin.
---
Not that it matters now, with the event gone :P
---
I'm pretty new and I just got my second character to 80. I've decided to go with FB over DH because I just prefer the way it plays and I also enjoy playing support sometimes.
---
I was watching videos and came across a [Woodenpotatoes video](https://youtu.be/QhrsqBUndGc) where he talks about his favorite open world Guardian setup, a power FB.
---
After looking for other power FB builds I kept coming across other newer players posting threads asking about power FB builds. These threads always resulted in them being told that it's a terrible idea.
---
So I guess my question is, is this a "bad" build? He seems to have success with it, and while I agree FB traits lean towards condition damage, it's not like guardians don't have power traits.
---
What am I gaining/losing by running something like this over a pure condition FB?
---
It is not "my own game". Its anets game. Unfortunately.
---
Three days ago I got my first really toxic encounter with a bunch of nerds doing recommended fractals. They were micromanaging everyone, being passive-aggressive or just down right rude. "Before you say something look at dps".
---
They had *shit* dps. I chimed in, and was told to shut the fuck up because I had only 3k AP. ???
---
And then the best fucking part is they kept wiping on Captain crow and we eventually had to 3 man it without them. They were full potted full geared. I didn't even bother to use some pots for *recommended* fractals. I don't know how they kept dying other than playing like utter shit I guess?
---
They ragequit right after.
---
Anyway, while this sucks I had a good laugh at their expense, and I'm happy to say this is such an exceptional case. I've had people getting frustrated when we couldn't complete a fractal, but never had anyone downright being toxic like they were.
---
Mesmer's always been Anet's brain Baby. and they hate nerfing it in any degree. It's also kinda stilly that Mirage literally outpreforms most other WvW DPS classes by factor of Surprise.   
---
You can get hit with like, 50 Attacks in 2 seconds with minimal to no warning. At least with Sic 'em Spambeasts you can see them coming a mile away and pop a deflect/block/reflect/ projectile destroy ( I'm personally fond of hitting hammer 2 on my DPS scrapper )
---
2 tips: 
---
You need only stealth to get Balthazar HP.
---
Mushroom Queen very dangerous but have relatively low health, prebuff, use some cheap power food, summon pets like embers. And CC her ASAP. DH/Firebrands can precast traps.
---
You wanna tell me they made downed state even more forgiving? Why? How?
---
Gw2crafts.net should help figure your cheapest option  you should also get some levels on the way. Once you hit level 80, look into exotic armour in a particular stat
---
Take Mistlook or Armistice bastion passes. More value with 0% ectogamble temptation.
---
I know "gw2 friendliest community" is somewhat an exaggeration but I only properly started raiding recently and agree with it. Maybe I've just been lucky but since the weekend I have joined multiple random pugs, a few failed attempts but no one's been 'toxic'. Even found some EXP groups too that didn't seem to mind or at least didn't call me out for things
---
F_ck you
---
~rangers
---
Hahaha 
---
(But yes you can rupt the pet with knock skills btw)
---
You mean those you can/are supposed to hit and stand on while sliding down in order not to die to full fall dmg on the last line of rocks?
---
FYI they don't reduce falldamage anymore.
---
Few tips i binded griffon mount to a key. 180 turnabout to a key too. After that its placing your skills where it feels most natural. If you pve maybe map and inventory would work too
---
I know, Chrono is what I usually play in raids dw :p
---
Mimic can be a bit necessary if you play in dual Chrono with close to no boon duration but if you have a bit of it you're fine indeed.
---
Giving characters themselfes a specific role is something I didnt really think about too much, I like the idea.
---
With my Warrior I acc played Ranked PvP before taking a break and I did have fun. And my Necro who is the only one with any notable Map progression could be the Open World slot.
---
Also I do have a close real life friend and his GF to play with so thats not the problem. Im even trying to get my GF into the game
---
There's nothing hardcore about strike missions so far, it's easier than some dungeons bosses.
---
Also, rather locked behind a hard boss than behind a meta event with a laughable drop rate.
---
Is gliding part of the core game? It's still attached to HoT right? So the reasoning for removal is kinda weird.
---
I don't play any mobile games. I had one installed recently but I never have the time to play games on my phone and it was super annoying getting notifications to login and stuff like that. Seeing you made this post why do you want a mobile version of this game?
---
True, it probably didn't stop but for those who are in it for the legendary armor, it's not the most efficient or fun way to do it. My whole beef is with kiroho suggesting that because afk pip farming CAN be done, therefore those working on Legendary Armor MUST necessarily be doing that and ignoring the reality of the sheer amount of time needed to complete a set within a sane timeframe.
---
Depending on how you look at it this is a self burn

Because they feel your question doesnt add anything useful or interesting to this sub.

---
If this makes you feel uncomfortable, maybe you should post your questions in the official forums from now on because this subreddit doesnt appreciate them too much.
---
It’s more now. Because the community is friendly but no, not nicer than ANY mmo. It’s nicer than WoW, but FFXIV, Warframe, LotRO, ESO, RuneScape are pretty nice too. Personal experience isn’t always representative.

GW2 pathing for teleports and shadowsteps are sometimes a bit weird/inconsistent and you can get a path where you wouldn't think there is and some other time no path when there clearly is (not that rare on weird uneven terrain or when you have structures touching each other).
---
That is unfortunately the the way it is in some cases. Best thing you oculd do is try to use the in-game bug report tool and hope that it get fixed eventually.
---
Yeah, I loved having it on my Weaver for the skill on fall damage. I loved gliding overhead and dropping on someone to make an electric fence around them or between enemies and allies while in Earth to knock down the incoming enemies and letting my allies get some distance. Also great for escaping.
---
Aargh! That’s gonna sting.
---
Strange since there seem to be a shit load of "hardcore" players on this reddit claiming things about the game. Are you telling me they left the game but are still here to shit on it because reasons?
---
Yeah that's what I'm saying, that corrupts and boon uptime have been powercrept to a point where you either have all boons or none of them with very little in between, because aegis and stab are the first to get corrupted and from there it's all downhill. 
---
I'm in favor of reducing corrupts from scourge and also drastically taking down firebrand boons so boons aren't quite as easy to come by and so maybe some other specs can see some time in the support spotlight.
---
And what's Pickleman's?
---
I think what it all comes down to with hobbies is "Am I having fun?". 
---
If the answer is yes, keep on. 
---
If no, then do what is fun instead. That might be something else in the game or another game or even something outside of gaming.
---
I wonder if they'll add some amount of fall damage reduction back as a mastery?
---
Sorry, should have used the other Quiznos logo that said "Quiznos Subs."
---
Hard nerf to Soften the Fall - darn.  I don't know how many times greatsword 3 and fall reduction / muddy terrain have saved my arse in pvp
---
They have done. Such a shame when trying to be helpful backfires like that.
---
Found the communist.
---
Most corrupts do not remove stab and aegis first. Only certain skills have a select corrupt order.
---
Could you link any Fractal CM PoV or log with a soulbeast that uses longbow??

Yes, I did eventually get my account back after 5 days, but the whole experience caused me to just completely drop the issue I initially contacted them about in fear of pushing things further and then losing my account in the process.

B-but let me overhype myself just to have absolutely impossible expectations which will then be crushed! /s
---
For real though, I'm excited for what's to come
---
Are you placing a group in the lfg-tool or are you the 15 people standing outside of a instance waiting for others to make a group and then join?
---
&gt; A-net, seriously get your shit together. These promotions are on worth your time, effort, or resources. You are flushing your marketing dollars down the toilette.
---
Build template money needs to go somewhere...
---
Whats your account name.number?   
---
Don't get torn about it. This giveaway really is pathetic and you'll easily outgrow the bag slot, the XP boost while nice you'll get from black lion bags and is dirt cheap in gem store, mini is honestly a reskinned one that already exists in game. I suppose the nice thing is the $10 off for PoF if you don't have it.
---
To focus on 1 thing add its achivment to watch list. If its legendarny crafting add it to gw2efficiency crafting list and watch progress ;)
---
You have half way through HoT. Which means you have season 3, PoF, season 4 and the beginning of the saga which if i understand you right you have not even touched yet. 
---
What about fractals, Raids, WvW, PvP, Achivements, collections,  Legendary gear, getting all your mounts including those that are on a collection, crafting, jumpingpuzzles, mini dungeons, adventures, bounty missions, well that is what came on top of my head, did you get in to this?
---
https://youtu.be/kHkVOAePTjE this channel has a few, the players he links in his descriptions might have some more themselves
---
Looks confusing. How about a help file that explains categories, filtering, etc?
---
Maybe this time is about trap detection? There are few enemies who place traps in PvE but we could be seeing new ones in the future.
---
Dodging off doesn’t change your speed downward. It just requires less distance to hit the ground. So by physics logic you should take less fall damage from dodging off the edge as you approach the ground with less velocity.
---
Play wvw, you can use testimonies of heroics to unlock elite specs
---
&gt; Those have to be big torment stacks because this trait competes with condition transfer when entering shroud which in pve is combined with blood is power and in pvp used for obvious reasons
---
I can't imagine the stacks are that big for a non-grandmaster trait, but I find myself wondering:
---
1. What the ICD of the trait is. 1-2 seconds could make it an attractive trait, but I'd be surprised if it wasn't 3-8 seconds.
---
2. How it interacts with bosses and CC resistant enemies. The wording suggests that it's just reliant on using a skill with control effects and not on the actual CC interruption of said foe, but it's pretty safe to be pessimistic until it's actually seen in action.
---
If it were in another spec tree it'd probably be a more interesting option to take but as you said; the condition transfer trait is so strong that it's hard to compete with it.
---
Go jump into a WvW match. I randomly did the other night, not knowing what to expect and it was crazy madness fun!
---
It's extremely exaggerated. GW2 is identical to every other MMO I've played. Friendly and helpful in the beginner zones (which it sounds like the OP was in and asked a question, there's always mentors and people hanging out in the 1-15 zones) and YMMV in later parts of the game.
---
I'd rather resources be put into game and leave launcher to rot in hell.
---
Idk if my sht helps but I converted around 800++ gold into gem and bought extra life sht. Its the only time I can actually convert my ingame gold into actual money and help others out of my fun time. And honestly speaking, there's nothing much to buy on GW2 anyway. So I just did it. Hope it actually helped
---
depends on your server I guess, I hate FA, they always go T1 and ALWAYS lose.
---
the big content patches in gw2 are living world but sadly living world is not big, it's pretty tiny and unexciting compared to other mmos, or ffxiv in this case
---
No, I don't want to go to rehab after playing GW2 24/7.
---
Okay I've heard of that one!  But from googling around for these, I'm gonna guess you're somewhere around eastern Nebraska.
---
Maybe you mean like Jimmy John's or Firehouse.
---
I was in the same boat bud, work on a few collections if while you grind for stuff to get the gear, throw in some T3 Fractals when you get bored. find a fun engaging guild (I found one that does dungeons and is kinda into me rambling about lore).  
---
in my situation I was waiting for LW to come while I was waiting I decided I would work on getting mats for legendary weapons.
---
It's ok to take breaks from games, or just stop playing them altogether. Maybe GW2 is not for you anymore even if you still feel a bit attached to it.
---
I haven't played since templates released. Between the template implementation and price, and Anet pairing my server to a French one that makes me not understand most players in WvW now, it just tired me out.
---
Personally I would just limit this in PvP modes then. Allow people to kit swap in certain zones in WvW and while dead in PvP arenas. 
---
I can see how this current system is broken to an extent, but these are fixes that Anet is going to look into and figure out if the public wants specific changes or if they should force a change on us. 
---
For PvM,I would def leave it untouched. Earning multiple ascended gear sets/legendaries is already difficult as it is. 
---
Reward players who do this by allowing them to shit on current bosses with multiple abilities at their disposal. Who knows maybe people using multiple kits will push Anet to create a game mode or add in a new tier of Fractals where having a certain type of rune that gives a certain type of resistance to some element will help or be required to complete. 
---
And the reward for these kinds of missions? Id vote for something really fucking good.
---
Im all about that airship
---
7 hours after the initial post, not 7 hours after the edits that added the codes. People were still redeeming ~20 minutes before I began trying based on other comments.
---
I used GDPR ruling with ANet and all they gave me was a massive list of IP address where I had previously logged in from.
---
&gt; I used to play guild wars alot and I loved it it is in my top 3 games I've ever played
---
This is not the guild wars sub
---
[Just a few examples](https://imgur.com/a/J5y6e6W), but (more than) half of the Firebrand utilities/tomes have more "roleplay" text than actual Skill description.
---
But actual trait descriptions are "over-complicated", okay.
---
I HAVE 400 COOKING, BUT I STILL CAN'T CRAFT A DOUBLE-MEAT, ROAST BEEF &amp; PROVALONE ON WHITE, THAT GIVES +50% MAGIC FIND, +25% GOLD AND +10% EXP FOR :30MIN???
---
I was coming on to say the same thing. It appears that, patch after patch, many of the skills/traits apply negative effects to the necro. I can't, off the top of my head, think of any class that has a similar issue. There are already enough "Cast this and also put vulnerability on yourself" in the necro skillset that doing this change seems like piling on.
---
That's rude towards GW1 which is a good game unlike the "sequel"
---
Well if nobody transferred to your server, you wouldn’t have any players. You must have ended up on that server at some point?
---
Only in areas you own.
---
They should work on EU like the thing with bubble tea and such.  
---
It's more feasible they're all already taken.
---
[deleted]
---
fairly simple to fix with a mastery like many posts here have said.
---
incoming damage resides with aoe and adds, if your able to dodge everything; you dont take ANY dmg at all... your difficulty would be finding enough dps to do it
---
!RemindMe 4 hours
---
It's a toolbelt skill that also removes conditions, and scrappers can stack it with a gyro to get an even faster revive. 
---
There was no need to buff it. If they reduced the recharge, they would have to remove or reduce the revive or condition removal to compensate.
---
Engineers always get this treatment because they have the potential to do many things at the same time. Because of a few possible builds that would be too much, others get restricted way too much.
---
I think you're asking the wrong questions.
---
Ranger in general have very strong weapon swapping skills where 2-5 are all very powerful while 1 is decidedly weaker. This is why if you want to play any kind of ranger well, you cast the biggest hitting 2, 3, 5 skills and then swap to cast quickdraw 2-5 and cast big nuke 2-5 again before swapping back, and repeat.
---
So, ranger is actually a bad fit if you want to use it as a sit back and 'pelt' class. Rifle thief, Sceptre guardian are all way better at 'pelting'. 
---
But then you also want to play something in a way that feels thematic to you? Don't feel bad about playing ranger thematically and not optimally. It's fine to play longbow ranger pelt mode, no one can kick you from pve open world exploration for that haha.
---
Why are you so keen on upvotes when the point is getting answers? Upvotes serve to shove the thread to the top of the subreddit. Does the whole world need to see your question for it to be answered? Probably not, so the downvoting action for questions isn't my style but totally understandable because they're not wrong it's objectively not a "top - must see" thread kinda post.
---
Bad bot.
---
**I don't like being salty**, but actually I unsubscribed from their social networks months ago for things like these. The whole 'freebies to streamers' campaign, while morally not a good thing, **it's reasonable as that actually has a chance of bringing people into the game.**  ԅ(≖‿≖ԅ)   
---
However, these USA-limited (*and somewhat rare eu included*) promotions/partnerships... **as someone who doesn't live in such regions** make me feel like a 3rd rate customer, whose only option is to bite her thumbs in silence. I'm not greedy, I don't want freebies, as a paying customer, **I only want to be treated and have the same opportunities that others have**, it shouldn't be too much to ask... right?  ¯\\(°\_o)/¯ 
---
In a sense it's understandable that they're an USA-based company and of course, as such they have their priorities and legal limitations. **Still, more often than not, they seem to forget that their product, is a digital game that operates on a global scale and their player base ain't solely composed of "legal citizens of the united states of america"**  (︶︹︶)
---
LOL! Good one 😂😂
---
Twisted castle hardest encounter :).
---
ooown! That's a really nice story =3
---
Explain?
---
yes it does, here is a video I made to show you.  You can also go test it yourself and obtain the same results:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7adl9avdXIA&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
You're being willfully obtuse. You read a single hypothetical statement, and you're now happy to lose the functionality you had for a chance to maybe potentially get something else in the future. I guess ANet hasn't made quite enough dumb decisions that impacted you personally yet, if you're still letting them slide on this one.
---
They themselves said in the post that
---
&gt; that bonus functionality eventually became the main reason to take the trait
---
which, let me translate it for you, means players were picking those traits not for the fall damage reduction, but for the other benefits they provided. And I'd wager fall damage reduction wasn't even close to being an important factor in that decisionmaking. As such, nothing will change with players' choice of traits after this change - players who were already running that trait will still be running that trait, because the important part of it hasn't changed. And because of this, ANet has no incentive to buff them in the future: why buff something that's already overly popular anyway. So no, don't except to get something in return for the lost functionality, you lost it because of a completely arbitrary decision to outright nerf something that nobody ever was complaining about. And until they prove me wrong with their actions, this opinion is valid just as much as any other.
---
TIL catching the ball resets the special action.
---
Yes. On particularly niche situations that they had to take into consideration when adjusting the traits, which limited the changes they could make to the traits.
---
Long story short, those effects were in the way of progress. Now that PvE has gliding and mounts where players are supposed to survive falls, there's no need to keep them using up traits.  
---
And they can't just be ignored since they have a weight in balance. 
---
So removing them was the only alternative. 
---
Remember when they fixed leap skills to ignore movement speed boosts? The reason why that had to be done is also one of the reasons fall damage had to be removed from traits.
---
There's other ways to bring the effect back, but they should not be in traits as they should affect combat, not exploration.
---
Yes! Just something to spend Core Tyria Mastery points on. They become almost completely pointless after getting the Fractal ones
---
A what?
---
no, you fall faster after dodging: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7adl9avdXIA&amp;feature=youtu.be
---
I agree. I don't mind them taking out the fall damage reduction but the cc from that trait is extremely useful, if situational, in pvp. Not a fan of this change.
---
Also many (if not most) jumping puzzles.
---
Awwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww.

That's so cute. Give her our best, will you?

But the price of the BLC exclusive isn't that volatile. It got up since the content got updated, not because of scarcity. Also, the actual value of something reflects more value than the average of the low. The changes in price reflect the will to pay for an item, so the value of the item at that time you looked (which is exactly what efficiency does, give the price of our account at the time we look)
---
For open world I like greatsword+axe/horn to have a ranged option.
---
If you don't need the range, go greatsword+sword/axe or greatsword+dagger/axe.
---
For pet go with the gazelle.
---
All this for power build.
---
You can also go condi Soulbeast and use the double shortbow build, it's not the top condi build but it gets the job done while being super easy to play.
---

Well they are a thing and anyone can get them
---
You should not be able to see guild members while they are on the opposite team.
---
The number of people who think this is an old video really showcases how poor-quality the reddit community has gotten.
---
But not as bad as dat quiznos partnership amirite?? Updoots to da left!
---
Isn't that the tunnel you take off-screen when you go to Fahranur? I think I remember hearing that originally the way toward the city was part of the mission but they cut it because it was too long or too boring.
---
Cool! I'd have thought it'd be worse since Anet merged the Asian servers with the EU ones for WvW, right? Thought I remember reading that, might've just imagined it though.
---
It's not weak, it's annoying. 
---
Wards should never be placed overlapped like the Hunter Marks made by Hunter's Ward. 
---
The pulsing area damage should have been the focus of the symbol, with a lower cooldown, and the ward should have been a single circle, not one around each target.
---
They do not really exist, you are under the effects of mass hallucination.
---
Try ff14 for a whirl you might like it better, or try coming back in 6 months
---
.....yeah this partnering with Quiznos is pretty weird. I couldn't care less.
---
Mistlock actually has a hidden awesome thing that isn't really advertised.
---
When you use the scroll to teleport to it, the portal device there will send you back to where you left from. This means you can go back and get items or sell stuff without interrupting what you are doing. In a roundabout way, it includes a bank access, a vendor, and a black lion trader all in one.
---
True, but it is funny to think that he saw that his guild mate gave up and swapped side.
---
Tbh if you don't do Fractals then Mistlock is nothing special. Airship is good for getting the Goggles above Not So Secret (That_Shaman has a video)
---
I'd say this is only confirms it's a mobile game, which isn't what I was disputing. I was disputing that it was Guild Wars 2 on mobile.
---
Perhaps, but for me at least, in a Fractal setting, i was running the Marshal/Shaman variant, and not being able to drop shades impacts DPS (which at times would hit upwards of 12K), and the loss of concentration/expertise also has a greater impact.
---
That was what I loved about Heal Scourge - it didn't play like a healbot, but a DPS build that put out respectable numbers, while also crapping out tons of barrier, heals, with some might and condi clear.
---
Have played my Necro as Reaper ever since the shade rework.  
---
It might not have affected Heal Scourge for Raiding, but I feel it killed it for Fractals, at least for me.
---

---
Ok good. Now can I get some insight for next time?
---
7:09, but if I wasn't watching the buff bar, I wouldn't have seen it. By the time the invul wears off you're already back at full health.
---
Welcome to Tyria.
---
Tip: the first "campaign" is like a Choose Your Own Adventure. You are supposed to play it many times with different characters and see the whole story weave together.
---
Welcome to the party!
---
Of course it wouldn't be a straight port of GW2, that's silly. One can also assume it would have been in the GW2 timeline which would make it a GW2 mobile game. It could have been anything, but we'll never know.
---
Yeah, GW2's only \*real\* lack is a way to enjoy playing the game as a tank. With that said, it sounds like you had some really garbage people. I did fractals daily for a while before Halloween got me focused on the labyrinth farm and I never had people like that. I've also done several raids and found really nice groups. Even when I got kicked for having too low DPS, it wasn't a mean thing. Also IDK people who make 200g an hour aside from the labyrinth farm that just ended with halloween so they're probably bullshitting you.
---
You also seem to have gone about some things really inefficiently which caused those feelings of grind. There's definitely SOME grind for some specific things, but a new player with access to the content can get geared up scarily-fast if they do it smartly. And you can do it even if you're really casual. So, here's some tips if you decide to get back in. I can't really help with the tanking side because yeah, that's a deficiency of GW2 at the moment where chrono can just tank things so much easier that no one really considers anything else for tanking.
---
1. You can get decent exotics for dirt cheap. You get 2g per day for doing dailies. You also get 2g daily if you kill Tequatl in Sparkfly Fen. I would need to check the TP, but I am pretty confident you can get fully-decked out in decent exotics for that price (probably level 78 exotics and not likely the right stat set unless you're pure power DPS, but still something). If yo uwant something in a M E T A stat set, just farm Verdant Brink for a while. You can get stat-selectable exotic 80 gear for like 1 gold and the airship parts. If you have tons of karma, you can also get level 80 exotic armor from the temples in Orr once the Pact has control of them. Again, these are core stat sets, so they'll be suboptimal, but it's a good start and you can do most things comfortably in them. Ascended is only required for high level fractals.
---
2. You can get ascended trinkets and backpieces incredibly easily with the Season 3 maps as well as some Season 4 maps. The easiest means of getting everything (i.e. two unique rings, two unique accessories, an amulet, and a backiece) is Bitterfrost Frontier and Dragonfall. There's SOME "grind" here but it's basically "gather nodes from this map for like a week" or "do events here for a couple hours" at worst and you can spread it out over time. OR use laurels to buy berserker stuff (minus the backpiece) if that's the stat set you need.
---
3. You can get ascended weapons basically for free by doing collections for the elite specs. I think there's a few that you wouldn't be able to get but it's also always good to have as broad a character pool as possible so you can play different roles or even just prepare in case a balance patch makes a class really good at something you enjoy (let's go, tank thief!)
---
4. You can get ascended stuff from fractal dailies. It's rarer from the lower levels you might be doing, but it's still a pretty good source of them.
---
5. You can get ascended stuff pretty easily from PvP. Even if you suck and lose, you can still get up to 3 grandmaster marks per ranked season which means you basically get a piece of ascended armor/weapons for like 5 gold and no investment in anything else. Might not be your thing, but it's an option.
---
6. And lastly there's crafting. Personally, I'd make this a last resort thing because it can be grindy. And really, I think the thing to craft would be chest armor since that has the lowest chance of dropping from fractals, IIRC.
---
Please don't ever do this again.
---
Scrapers are set up for this sort of thing and it drastically lowers the chances of anyone getting a code if it's posted in plaintext.
---
I haven't seen anyone ask. So I'll ask. How did you get so many codes?
---
Not really, it's still used all the time in PvP
---
I agree that would be ideal. I’m also not hating on the GW2 system either, just looking at it through the MMO prism, if they wanted to improve that system it could be a great benefit to the game overall.
---
It won't work unless those allies are next to your foe. You can only cast feedback on foes now, unlike before
---
Can’t wait.  Let’s do this.  Margonites *everywhere*, please!
---
And here I came expecting a crazy expose about how build ~~loadouts~~ templates came to be this way, like the one about how Anthem turned out the way it did, and all I find is a sub par joke.
---
How is that in any way relevant to the issue?
---
Public relies on public commanders. However at the current moment commanding publics isnt fun, isnt rewarding and requires a LOT of effort.
---
While the community takes it for granted and will happily go wherever they need to, to follow people this isnt sustainable.
---
In the end it just ruins the fun for everyone as public comms are literally bullied out of the game by bad apples they cant get rid of. And many of these bad apples dont realise they're doing it, they're simply playing for their own interest.
---
Can someone name a few new comms that are rising up in EU? Can someone name some active comms that have a community? Because most are guild bound, and older remaining comms. 
---
There is a reason fewer and fewer wvw comms exist. And were at a point where many servers are so dead that if you lead actively and friendly on any server, its activity will increase very quickly as people from "dead" servers move.
---
If you want public commanders you need server control so healthy communities can form. Too many leeches trying to get scraps from the few remaining communities isnt good and will just make things worse.
---
January 26, 2016 	
---
    This skill is now ground targeted and no longer requires a target.
---
Unless you talking about future changes I am not aware, its quite opposite.
---
/r/whoosh
---
Yeah, I was considering looking at another class.  I have a mezmer, but afraid its going to have the same type of issues.  Maybe I need to powerlevel a warrior.
---
I finally got fed up with WoW after the Nazjatar patch, and went looking for something different. I'm fine with dailies, I've gotten loads of mounts through dailies. But holy hell it's gotten ridiculous. It feels like I was paying Blizzard $15 a month to WORK for them. It ceased to be fun, doing the SAME quests, a hundred times, just to earn the right to fly in the zone, so I could maybe get to a rare in time to tag it before it's dead since NOBODY waits for anyone anymore, and gods forbid you ask them to, they'll call you names.
---
Guild Wars 2 is like a breath of fresh air. Chat isn't full of trolls constantly trying to outdo each other. People are actually NICE. And you can buy a random mount for a measly $5?! Yes, please! I can actually play the game, instead of grinding the same quests until I'm ready to scream. If I give ArenaNet $15 a month, I'll get all kinds of cool mounts and pets, so I can do what I WANT in the game, instead of paying Blizzard just for the right to do stuff that I'm sick to death of. 
---
And the Asura are ADORABLE. WoW finally got a cute race with the Vulpera, but you have to grind dailies to get exalted with them to play one. Seriously. 
---
My only concern is end game. I'm a bit autistic, and I've never yet found a guild patient enough to keep me around, so I two man old content with the husband. I hope there are things we can do by ourselves. 
---
If not, maybe I'll feel less burned out on WoW by then.
---
Edit: I'm going to presume the downvotes are either from current WoW players, or people who are jealous of my paltry $15 a month game budget.
---
Thanks for the link.  I have been reading through it.  A lot of information there.
---
Thanks...
---
I posted the screenshots =)
---
It can be considered free if you bought the Ultimate edition of Path of Fire for $80. Standard PoF for $30 with $50 worth of gems, plus the deluxe edition items (including the pass).
---
only joke i can see in there is if its referring to OPs image and quiznos happens to sell some kind of breaded object with meats and other objects in the middle.
---
but if that is the reason for the woosh, its a damn good one.
---
Are you just wanting to point out people enjoy the thing?
---
In game =/= Reddit.
---
I learned that later sort of, but I wanted to be as prepared as possible before going into raids. So I was watching videos of the fights, reading, looking at builds/rotations, looking at optimal builds (while also creating my own or seeing if I could put my own twist on it, I really enjoy creating unique combinations and testing their capabilities though not at the detriment of others). So to not be a hinderance I was trying to make sure I had the best gear going to in and got burnt out going that route. 
---
Also, I just couldn’t get into DPS as it isn’t my preferred role. As I tried getting into chrono tank it got changed so much and ended making some of my grind worthless would have to do some more grinding to reset stats on my trinkets and get new pieces for armor. I wasnt vibing the Druid healer aspect. Firebrand was okay but tomes felt clunky to me.
---
It’s not the games fault. It’s mine.  Or every game is for every person. So my conclusion was I wasn’t fit for this game. Thank you for your time and effort for your post.
---
Shill?
---
Legendary bounty farms will net you up to 50 elegy mosaics (rare) per kill.
---
Edit: to find these just go in lfg, usually after reset, in any of the original PoF maps, you’re bound to find something.
---
Wait what? I need a shadowbringers copy
---
Haven't they always been in charge of marketing? I seem to recall the original Guild Wars having an odd launch trailer (granted, not as odd as GW2's live-action commercial) that seemed to have nothing to do with the game beyond having Devona, Aiden, and Cynn in it, which was explained at the time as having been prepared by NCsoft rather than ArenaNet...
---
&gt;Also, best way to get Elegy Mosaics?
---
Make a legendary bounty train for PoF maps. On prime time, it almost always fills after waiting for 5-10 mins and doesn't die for hours afterwards.
---
Then you just waypoint each leg bounty board in each maps and kill whichever is up. Bonus if you can multi instance some maps (like ppl end up in a new map with all bounties up, you can go there to repeat same map.)
---
Elegy mosaics are really easy to get, just takes some time if you don't tell squad to do good deeps :) I made sure we had all boons and 25 might, things die fast.
---
Yep, we're in full backswing atm. Look at the comments in this thread. Whatever, game is dead anyways.
---
My phrasing for this "technique" used by these MMO companies is "They are making it preschooler accessible."  As the simplification and reduction of variation gets to be so excessive, we are just competing with what a bot/macro on loop could do.
---
A year or so ago, WoW reduced the number of skills down from like twenty to six... and that was my "goodbye, so long, auf Wiedersehen, farewell," moment.  Further before that, they made it so you had to max a skill tree before you could point into another.  It took any real creativity away from the users and resulted in "simple" cookie-cutter builds... pick one of three and go play like everyone else.
---
I really do not know if I should be offended that they think the player-base is dumb enough to not handle variation... they do not want it... or the players really are that confused.  It is why I liked Rift for so long... and PoE in turn... and D2 before them.  The complexity and variation of skill trees rather than making everyone the same.  Yes, most people prolly play the games for relaxing after work/school.  I like having the fun of taking my anger out on mobs, a bit of social aspect, and solving a puzzle (not necessarily a jumping puzzle, but in making fun, viable builds) that keeps my mind active and sharp.
---
The current signet is brought on heal scourge not for the LF gen, dagger already provides a ton more than you need, but more so for two reasons. The first is basically because there is nothing better as most necro utilities are super minor for the most part. The second, is that in certain very specific situations, the current signet makes a good "oh crap" button--whole group goes down, shroud 4 to bring them together and drop the signet to potentially save the raid.
---
In GW1, we could make boons and conditions bigger but it was the whole bar that was enlarged. With GW2 and its countless amount of effects, we need to be able to select which boon/condi/effect to display.
---
I do but I kept getting ascended of different armor types. At the time I was needing cloth but kept getting tons of rings which I didn’t need anymore, or leather/heavy armor. So I figured I needed to find a way to get the items I need.
---
I know I don’t need thousands of gold, but I always just felt broke, prolly because I was trying to make my legendary Sunrise and help my wife make her nevermore.
---
I was also trying to get ascended before raids. See other reply above this post for the why.
---
Nice idea. Btw u can do that already....in GW1 :) Servers are still up! :)
---
Then it couldve been split between PvE and PvP. Maybe 3 people is too much in PvP. But in PvE, it actually was nice that it had a distinction. Not all things are homogenous in gw2, just take a look at things like spotter/banners/etc. If it was a stronger res than another signet, they couldve tweeked other numbers besides the entire active of the signet (which is already rarely used).
---
I'd LOVE that.
---
&gt; it would be a hassle to switch to those traits only in the niche cases where it would be useful
---
If only we had a quick effective way to change traits to an infinite variety of different combinations on the fly...
---
I think there used to be something like that. ANet should look into creating that kind of functionality. I bet a lot of people would really like it.
---
We're hoping since 7 years. I mean...
---
Thing is, for every voice that says "We want more random ass niche skills", there's a voice saying "There's only one viable way to play X spec, give us more meaningful options". They're two competing demands, and neither side will get everything they want.
---
You can certainly do that, but it will spoil the story for you, as acquiring a mount requires you to play through the opening of the Path of Fire expansion.  Depending on how you feel, that may or may not be something to be concerned about.  It's also possible to do that without boosting to 80 if you find another player to help, they can run through the mission for you while you hide in a corner and try your best to ignore the dialogue.
---
Getting a single mount might be helpful, but the core Tyria zones are reasonably compact with lots of waypoints, so it's not really necessary to have a mount to explore them and level normally.  But that's your call to make.  When I did my levelling and exploring through core Tyria zones years ago, mounts didn't exist so I didn't have to see lots of other players using them around me, and I guess that might inspire some envy if I did. ;)
---
I think I made it to the high 60s/low 70s for fractal number. The fights weren’t difficult. Some challenge here and there more of an agony check. The stated +9 infusions were pretty expensive. I was trying to get them, but only ever really ended making my own unstated infusions for +7/+9 and such. I noticed that a +16 can be traded for 5 stayed +9s so I working towards that. I don’t remember how much agony I ever ended up getting off the top of my head but I feel like with potions a such maybe 110-120 feels right?
---
The end fractal (25,50,75,100; observatory?) was tons of fun. Nightmare was okay. Deep stone was fun the first couple of times then felt tedious, though the final fight was good. Battleground was very repetitive. Aqua seemed meh but that was probably more the water combat especially as a chrono since I couldn’t use any wells.
---
A new no-mount, no-glide area in the upcoming map that would be made trivial with fall damage reduction? Maybe some part of the new strike mission that they'd rather just nerf everyone than work on the design more?
---
you forgot to copy the 50+ threads that shit on anet and the game last week.
---
Yeah I’m on the fence on that too. I don’t have it set for renewal right now. (Different conversation. I complete respect people’s decision for abstaining and continuing with using some services that have had some recent controversial stances (and some blatantly wrong). There was a good comment somewhere and I’m going to butcher it, but basically it said something like you can still use a product while protesting the company in other ways. Also since I bought the 3 months prior to their incidents, it’s money I already spent and time in game with friends.) I never played ESO. I heard a rumor about classic TBC and Classic WotLK. Ulduar would be fun to revisit it was one of their top raids (Black Temple, Ulduar, ICC, Karazan, MC are all great ones in no particular order.)
---
I've never seen anyone here use the term hardcore to describe themself tho and the reason many of the dedicated raiders/t4 cm's players still stay here and complain when anet did a fuck up is because they actually still care because none of us wanted GW2 to become the joke it is now. The ones that still complain are the ones that want anet to thoughen up, admit they made a lot of mistakes and realize why they did them, communicate with the players and say what they'll do to fix them. And sadly the only way to make any progress towards this is bitching about every mistake they do so they atleast catch some wind what they did was bad instead of them staying in their own bubble where everything they do is perfect and only toxic male cis gamers complain.
---
I think most players’ favourite skins aren’t from the Gem Store, but it’s true that almost everything boils down to a gold sink (which makes sense so that players can just do gems-&gt;gold), but it would be nice if that weren’t the case.
---
that is true, speaking about previous standards.
---
with powercreep and the in general higher skill floor on basic gw combat (see HoT and PoF enemys), releasing a new world boss like tequatle nowadays would be piss easy.
---
Quickbrand likes a word
---
You forgot build templates thread section xD
---
You're basically saying that vets &amp; other players shouldn't give their own opinions or talk about their own experiences... In which case, why bother posting this on the subreddit in the first place? 
---
The point of this forum is to start discussion. Discussion is a 2 way street. We're glad OP is enjoying it, but we're also giving our opinions on why we don't enjoy it as much anymore. 
---
Also i find your quote about "rather bitch about Quiznos than attract new players" ironic... Because the reality is that Anet are the ones utterley failing at attracting new players (since it's ultimately their responsibility, not ours) and we're telling them why they should change their methods.
---
Doing the Path of Fire metas daily will get you both Elegy Mosaics and Amalgamated Gemstones, which are both required for Funerary Incense.  Ideally, you do this for a while before you make your Legendary, so that when it's time to do so you're prepared for it.
---
While the Amalgamated Gemstone is a daily reward from PoF metas, you get Elegy Mosaics each time you do them.  So you can check in each two hours to bash a pinata, or each hour to lead Junundu sieges or kick some metal doggos.  It's more common to find a group of players doing those metas than it is to find Legendary bounty farms.
---
Longbow is bad
---
Hold up, last one was my post and it was a trollpost.
---
Haha yeah..I'm just running around and I see all these people on amazing looking mounts (seriously some of the best I've seen in a mmo) so it got me curious about the idea of doing this. Thanks for the info!
---
Ranger has been BiS in raids since they came out, your guild doesn't know anything
---
I've been playing GW2 for over 7 years and I still love it. Unfortunately there is a lot of negativity in this subreddit, so take everyone's pessimism with a grain of salt.
---
I hope you and your friend have a great time.
---
i'd honestly rather get urinated on than have this game ported to mobile
---
Is it worth getting into the game now?
---
Haha yeah. I'm avoiding throwing out ones that people would actually know lol.
---
Run out of foil?
---
The money involved just buys a sandwich for the homeless, so hopefully they're down with that. XD  DM me and we can work out details.  I've got one code left on me or I can pick up another (or your own Quiznos app order + code) on Tuesday night. :)
---
It definetly is, game is alive, and if youre new, you have shit load of great content available to you.
---
&gt; And don’t get me started on metas and “you must do at least this much dps or kicked”. F that noise.  
---
welcome to gw2, if you want to do fractals or raids, you are in for a suprise. for a big one even, because doing dps in gw2 is not just pressing a macro or 5 buttons, you will have sometimes harder, sometimes easier x step rotations you have to do for x time else your dps will suck. as anet quoted...the average player in gw2 does 10% of the dps compared to a top player. we are talking 30k vs 3k here.  
---
good luck in whatever you want to do. if its just openworld &amp; story, you will be fine...everything else, with that mindset you will have a hard time. especially here were stats on your armor do not matter at all if you can't play the game which can be quite fast paced.  
---
you will definitly not find hit macro x and go afk or heal from time to time in this game. you will have constant action without global cooldowns. its a action combat mmo after all.
---
The other part that I found hilarious with how the Signet of Capture worked was that until you got back to town, you would have multiple elite skills on your bar, which could get some jank interactions with like Star Burst and Searing Flames
---
Exactly.
---
Hmm, perhaps Schlotzky's then?
---
There was concept art released from an artist that looked mobile game esque with areas that were recognisable from guild wars.
---
When a new release comes out it's 1 hour of story content, a new map that has a bunch of press F grindy collections and new gemstore items.  That's not "doing great" which is why people shit on it.  Look at patch notes from ESO, WoW or FFXIV and compare to GW2 and you'll see it's not even close.  I can't speak to ESO but I know FFXIV and WoW get 10x the content of GW2 every 3-4 months.
---
Problem is Anet's development staff is too busy polishing the stone and creating gemstore items instead of actually developing playable content.  GW2 isn't really a game, it's more of just an art piece.  It's very very poorly optimized and designed but looks pretty.  I mean look at the detail in any map and you'll find that mundane objects like a vase or a plant have the same number of polygons as the player character.  That's just nutty and absolutely dumb.
---
GW2 had so much potential for competitive pvp and the community and anet really turned in it in a very surprising way for me. Played for almost 3 years and I still linger on Reddit hoping it might become what it could have been
---
Yepppp...came here to say something similar. +1!
---
what
---
Doesn't every MMO community say this?
---
I am conflicted about sinking time in GW2 again after playing some of ESO. What is better about GW2 over ESO?
---
Oh well thanks a bunch then, I genuineliy didn't know about that !
---
Sure is.  Most complaints on the subreddit are from veteran players who've played for 5+ years and done the majority of content available in the game, and who want there to be even more things added so they can play more.  As a brand new player, someone who hasn't done any of the content available in the game, you'll have a lot to do if you start playing now.
---
Sorry about that. 
---
Of course I meant a hand crafted shaving razor store with three locations across the globe.
---
i Dont remember themmsaying this but that would be awesome
---
Same same. Even when new expacs came out I never felt behind as a lot of people put it. I just did the next content got the gear along the way. Even though you had to roll on gear in WoW in dungeons and such I never felt out if I lost the roll and had to run again or next week. Since a lot of the drops are curated if a piece dropped for your class chances are you could use it. But with GW2 drops even though no one fights over a piece the drops we do get are so random that it feels like you get pieces which have a stat or two that you use and a stat or two you don’t. Or it’s a piece you can’t use at all. I got lucky one time in Teq and got an ascended staff, but none of my characters used staff or at least in any sort of meaningful way. So it sat in my bank because I can’t sell it, and I feel like I can’t salvage it because if things change then id feel without.
---
Always find these threads on the frontpage funny after big meltdowns.
---
It's like some people are desperately looking forward to something positive and then find some random new player's praise and go "oh god yes finally deploy the upvotes!!"
---
... When I'm the one that's trolling our group? LOL.  The only reason I can troll you guys is because you put some effort into the game in the first place &lt;3.  It's a shame there's not a better way to troll everyone at Deimos, but Firebrand was a much better choice for oil-kiting.
---
Damn, that was quick, lol
---
I haven't seen anyone "trying to sink the game". Just people voicing their discontent, much like there are people voicing their enjoyment.
---
Here's the thing with GW2: if you are an extremely hyper casual open world only player that doesn't care at all about fashion and only wants to do story, meta events and world bosses then this game has no grind whatsoever.  If you step out of that then this is the grindiest MMO I have ever played and I've played WoW, FFXIV, Neverwinter, BDO and more.
---
In GW2, the grind is 80% of the time for gold to buy your gear.  Gearing out a single power DPS in full exotics is around 20g or so.  If you ever want to go for ascended you either need to grind through fractals or grind gold since each ascended piece is about 40-50g.  That's just a single character.  If you want to do fashion then the collections for a lot of skins is horribly grindy.  If you want gemstore fashion items each one is at least 400 gems which is a chunk of gold.  And legendary anything is about $2k gold and collections.
---
GW2 boils down to a game where if you want anything you either swipe your credit card to buy gems or you grind braindead easy content for hours on end to get gold.  I never felt burnt out because of a grind in any other MMO besides GW2 but I'm not a hyper casual open world only player.  Those players can get buy buying a single outfit from the gemstore every now again and pressing 1 on content in blue level 50 gear.
---
^^^ cancer
---
Wooden Potatoes has a lot of guides on how to properly play classes in the open world.
---
This video is one of them and there are more to come, and I would highly recommend them to everyone.
---
I'm a 7 year veteran of this game and even I learned quite a few neat things about the game while watching it.
---
Great stuff!
---
the problem is that they're so adamant about the game not being so ui focused or whatever. I forget the exact phrase they used but it was something along the line of "play the game not the ui." it's not a bad concept but they've certainly been doing a very poor job at making things visually distinct (e.g. boons and visual clutter)
---
You know too much, GoodBye.
---
Good to hear OP. I have a friend of mine that was hooked on WoW for years but recently tried GW2. Since then he's been playing almost nothing but GW2 and found himself crushing out Halloween achievements pretty much everyday. Keep having fun!
---
I've played thousands of hours of this game. But WoW, ESO and Gw2 are all very different games for different types of players.
---
WoW and Gw2 both have a special place in my heart.
---
But you can't really compare them on much.
---
Exactly. Someone who hasn't even hit 80 yet isn't going to give a shit about build templates or raid complaints or whatever.
---
I missed out too. I hope He responds to my PM as by the time I get home from work these kinda things are gone :(
---
Happy to hear you're enjoying the game!
---
4 years late to be an introduction imo, and for a "the state of X" series it's spread out too far. also can't really be regarded "tips and tricks" series.
---
overall this feels rather disorganized as a project to me.
---
They're doing a promotion with Quiznos where you can get some small in-game rewards if you get a sandwich there and people are really mad about it for some reason
---
Welcome to the Gw2 family ! 😄
---
I'm a wow vet and left for the same reasons. Wish I had joined in earlier!
---
Templates bans Quiznos! ESO still &gt; GW1 and 2 lul
---
These posts are stupid
---
Their newest marketing deal. Buy sandwich at one of like 3 Quizons that are still open , get 10 slot bag, generic mini and few boosters.
---
anet forgetting gemstore items exist? that's a first.
---
the wvw one does the same
---
&gt;You're basically saying that vets &amp; other players shouldn't give their own opinions or talk about their own experiences... In which case, why bother posting this on the subreddit in the first place? 
---
It's not a matter of don't post your experiences. Post your complaints in one of the other dozen or so threads on the front page dedicated to complaining, don't rain on a new player's fun by making his thread about you. 
---
&gt; The point of this forum is to start discussion. Discussion is a 2 way street. We're glad OP is enjoying it, but we're also giving our opinions on why we don't enjoy it as much anymore. 
---
Not every discussion needs to go to the same spot. There are so many places to talk about the negative, and there are so many positive aspects about the game that go undiscussed. Threads started with positivity should be kept positive. None of the veteran complaints mean anything to a new player, not one. He never had arcdps, so build templates are a straoght upgrade for him. He's never played WvW, so the fact that people are still waiting for alliances won't be a concern for him. Veterans need to remember that their experiences, while valid, are not universal and certainly don't need 100% representation in every thread on the subreddit. 
---
It's like a casual player going into a raid kill thread and complaining that raids are stupid and he'd never play content so elitist. Like, that's his experience, but it's wholly unwelcome in that psrticular thread, and generally it gets downvoted to oblivion. People are entitled to their opinions, but it's common courtesy not to repeat them in places where they're unwelcome with the target audience. We all share this subredsit; have some tact when it comes to sharing your opinion.
---
&gt; Also i find your quote about "rather bitch about Quiznos than attract new players" ironic... Because the reality is that Anet are the ones utterley failing at attracting new players (since it's ultimately their responsibility, not ours) and we're telling them why they should change their methods.
---
A) Nonsense, new players are coming in all the time, and B) this quiznos meme is stupid. They made a beautiful trailer for Season 5, they're doing a fine job of advertising it. Stop focusing on promos as of they represent the only or even the main advertising this game does. It's ridiculous.
---
Because "the community" and the new player experience are the only positive things left to really talk about.
---
Totally on the same boat.
---
Each and every time that the video is posted I think to myself "you don't need to watch the video AGAIN", "you already saw that video tons of times", etc.
---
And yet, every single time I end up watching it again. Shut up Kormir.
---
I could have posted this myself. Exact same story with me. Wow had me hooked on its story and i loved it for the better part of while I played it. And then there came this - BfA... then one day saw a video on GW2 and looked really great and bought the game. The last time I had such fun was the first few months I first played wow and swtor.
---
Definitely putting in lots of hours on this amazing game.
---
Enjoy it, don’t spend money on gems, and make some memories.
---
TBH that was a lot of info and not sure what you were getting at most of the time? From what I understand you were saying... Is that this game isn't about "you better be this meta build or get kicked" but more there are a lot of different builds and as long as you hold your own DPS wise you should be fine? 
---
That may become a bit of a problem later on in the game only because both her and I are not strict hardcore players we want to do the hard fractals however she would deal amazing DPS (in WoW) but because of her age is not great at dodging or rolling out of something when she needs to at the exact time while dpsing (that's just one example). So she gets kicked or not invited in future raids and her feelings get hurt...so I end up playing with her and we do other things because WoW has become "you better be elite tier or get kicked". 
---
You won't have to worry about elitism or bringing any of the attitude that comes from WoW that was one of the main reasons we laughed and we couldn't stand it. actually I was ready to hold all the time because for years I ran a guild full of older people that were just really down-to-earth amazing fun people to play with and talk in discord but not exactly great or talk to you or when it came to raiding or the fast-reflex stuff :) but we don't care! To me relationships are way more important and we will just have a blast crafting our sets and running what we can.
---
And from what I remember guild wars has a lot less at a toxic community and people have generally been amazing this far :)
---
Nice!!! Welcome to gw2. It's an amazing Journey!!!
---
I have some pieces of advice for you:
---
1- using in-game chat you can type /wiki whatever.
---
(Whatever can even be an item link, you do that with shift+click). This will make you a pro player instantly!
---
2- metabattle wiki has builds and guides 
---
(People here will tell you metabattle is Bad and you should check dt/sc, but the builds are the exact same).
---
Dt/Sc has builds for fractals (our dungeons) and raids, while metabattle has all those + open world pve, PVP, WvW.
---
Metabattle also has guides:
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Guides#PvE
---
Check out the gearing and the level 80 guide: how to solo anything.
---
3- Leave this place (Reddit) and never come back
---
 All the  toxic assholes hang out here and 
---
 Boy are they loud!
---
Good luck in your journeys!!!!
---
Of course not :)
---
Like I mentioned before I'm a returning player I have a level 80 in remember fractals....were coming to have a blast and have been doing Just that!
---
The point of the post is that anet only see that what they do is great and that lead to pr disaster again and again. don't be sorry.
---
Welcome to Tyria!
---
Hope you have lots of fun
---
Thanks! Who's Jorney?
---
Hey there! Mind if I ask a question? I'm a bit curious...
---
I've seen and heard a lot of debate and conversation over what constitutes the "personal info" that GDPR refers to in terms of what gets disclosed or deleted at a user request, and I'm curious what your interpretation or understanding of that all is.
---
In my experience from my place of employment and experiences requesting my data, it generally comes down to more surface level and directly identifiable details - names (particularly full names - in a lot of cases, it seems first names alone don't count for enough,) email addresses, IP addresses, billing address, phone numbers, etc.
---
On the next level, though, there are more questionable things that I've seen presented by some and withheld by others - a username specific to that website (like 420PraiseMordremoth for me here on Reddit, or your display name in GW2,) character names, your purchase history (outside of where billing address is concerned - how much money you've spent on an in-game store, or the specific items you've purchased,) chat logs, and stuff like that. It seems like these aren't often disclosed when I've done a data request, though I'm admittedly not sure what (if anything) happens to them when I request a deletion.
---
Beyond that, though, there are other things, like internal notes about your account that I don't think I've ever seen disclosed by a company - maybe a record of bans or other disciplinary actions, a record of changes made to the account, and such. I can't recall ever receiving anything like this when I've made info requests, though I don't think I've had anything that qualifies as a disciplinary action on any of the services I've gone through the process with, nor would I have any way of knowing if such a system exists for them anyway. To me, though, I suppose it makes sense because depending on how the info is stored and recorded, it may not be tied to your personal identity directly, meaning companies can get away with withholding it - if I just have a note on my account saying "Banned for 24 hours for dropping an f bomb," for example, that doesn't identify me as me, and therefore I can understand how it might not be covered by GDPR's protections and regulations.
---
Just curious if you have any experience with defining these categories of data so I can be a bit more informed on what should be given to me when I make a request, and where I might need to be a bit more suspicious.
---
This exactly. People almost exclusively judge builds based on their effectiveness I'm high end group pve content. What's good in open world solo content is very different, and woodenpotatoes build series is specifically aimed at that play style.
---
People will tell you builds like that are subpar or not optimal, but they are making assumptions that you intend to bring that same build to a fractals and raids, which may not be true. What is best in open world is completely different than what is best in fractals and raids.
---
I've heard it from ESO, FF14 and wow classic.
---
Nevertheless, I'm glad you're enjoying yourself!
---
Actually, they have quite the fetish for arbitrarily restricting gem store items.
---
I think at least half of the total appearence items in the gem store are not permanently available.
---
Its pretty stupid.
---
Because one quick google search will tell you that Quiznos is known for predatory franchisee practices. You ever wonder why a Quiznos would spring up and close with a year or two? Or why there aren’t any Quiznos’ anywhere?
---
Or the threads are created by undercover ANet operatives. Dun...dun...dunnnnnnnnnnnnn.
---
I never enjoyed the gameplay in WoW. Tank and spank is just boring. Watching and rotating through a bazillion skill cool-downs just isn't as exciting as when you can focus on what's actually going on with the animations.
---
I mean, I enjoy stuff like D&amp;D, but those also allow you to do a lot more than the predefined scripts of a game.
---
Personally, I would prefer these games be in VR already, where the player affordances allow for a lot more variation beyond predefined animations (ex. crouching at various heights versus pressing a button and always going to a set height; blocking attacks at various angles and counterattacking to hit specific weak spots compared to only having 2-3 angles you can block, etc.).
---
It's much ado about nothing in my opinion. Completionists might be annoyed about missing a mini, but they are also making the assumption that that same mini will never be available again in some other way which may not be true.
---
Is there any significant benefit to using the guild map reward bonus buff for Dragonfall farming? I usually use the guild magic find buff for all open world activities. Dragonfall's map rewards are bonus volatile magic though, so I was wondering if I should change to the map rewards buff.
---
Ugh, I play WvW exclusively and will be sad to see fall damage mitigation disappear.
---
That certain point is literally thousands of hours in for the majority of players. You are only proving the point of the original comment you are responding to.
---
welcome to THE REDDIT COMMUNITY OF ETERNAL RANT. 
---
just so you know
---
If you're only spending 3 hours on the new content when it hits you're not even trying
---
Seriously. Fall damage reduction traits are actually useful in WvW, especially when you're moving around territories you don't own.
---
keep in mind a lot of big publishers pay people to write heart-warming stories and reviews on their products to attempt to dodge criticism
---
I left WoW for this game also, OP.  I agree, this game is very special, and no other game has a mesmer. I didn't go through the entire thread, so I don't know if this was said or not, but in my opinion this is the only mmo, and probably one of the only, if not the only, fantasy games that I felt put so much thought into making Black people a part of their universe. PoF is something very special to me and my little sister for that reason. To give us a whole continent, hairstyles, faces, armor designs, and North African architecture and style, and do it all so beautifully, I don't know if I can fully express how much that meant to us. It may not seem like a big deal to some people, but it's rare. Usually it's just brown complexion plastered over White features, essentially making a dark white person lol. But because of that, I will probably stick with GW2, even tho i'm very critical of the game, especially as of recent.
---
Sadly you really will get less as a support. Anet has tried to mitigate this some so that if you are giving boons and healing it will count towards your enemy tagging, but you still have to land at least a hit on someone to get a tag.
---
Supports are very important in WvW but I don't blame you for getting tired of it. They need to find a better way to reward support play.
---
You absolutely can. This is such a tired and overused comment on this sub. Critical posts aren't downvoted, negative comments aren't buried by "white knights" and it isn't only positive memes and art (it's the opposite for the former).
---
As someone that is frequently critical, and tends only to make new posts that are critical or raise concerns, give it a rest. Let people have a touch of positivity and welcome someone new to the community instead of jumping down their throats with the skewed perspective of someone that's thousands of hours in.
---
Rangers use swords in every high and low fantasy scenario. (Aragorn, John Snow, Drizzt...) Why you wanna play bow for the fantasy aspect?
---
Without any way to get the Knight of the Grove package again, the only way to get it is guaranteed wardrobe unlocks.
---
It's never been sold by BL statuettes, and there's no individual back vouchers, only glider and back+glider combo vouchers. 
---
I can't remember the Knight of the Grove pack ever coming back since the first time it was released.
---
I rarely think about Quiznos at all
---
ok i got to ask i have the base game and thinking of returning but i hear in path of fire 
---
you can get griffin mounts that can "fly" however upon looking into it more it seems they are more akin to enhanced gliders? they cant like fly like say in wow fully but have like limited mechanics? kinda sucks if so....
---
Even one of the "grindiest" things in this game (skyscale), is obtainable in less than a week of casual play/grind (went from 0 to 250 of each mats in 4 days of gathering), have fun in GW2.   
---
But not gonna lie, GW2 is incredible when you're new, awesome when you hit 80 and "meh" when you're a veteran, but you still got a looooong way left to be a veteran, so have fun!
---
!remindme 4h
---
It is a strategy to push real money sales
---
I loled IRL. Literally said, lol. Not L.O.L, but lol. I loled.
---
b2p can't have a sub, or it's not b2p anymore
---
Yeah, the Anet has a lot of goodwill from its community going for it. It's a shame they're burning through it faster than they can replenish it.
---
“Bad” is understatement imo.  It’s almost as there are some people working inside the Anet purposefully trying to destroy it.
---
"This game sucks!" - 10k hours played
---
Is it really easier though?  I find the convenience of on-demand crafting to be worth it over RNG or through currencies.
---
They'd be too incompetent for such a scheme. And too busy eating their sandwiches.
---
This is Not about Not wanting Art and espacially Not from me 
---
All the Art in the sub is one Factor the "Hater" Side uses to discredit the sub and the Playerbase for being to Casual and Not able/ Not wanting disscussion of Problems 
---
While Others use legitimate criticissm regardless of subject as a Factor to call the whole sub toxic and elitist 
---
Both Art(or positive posts in general) and critic Posts should both be here and valued by everyone
---
Its a good casual game. Just don't invest in it.
---
Definitely.
---
that is nothing new and a strategy to influence customers into impulsively buying for fear auf missing out (again). in this case however the item was available a single time. bit of a different caliber.
---
Me: I don't have to watch this for god-knows-which-time 
---
My brain: But you gotta
---
Wiki confirms, the pack was up for 2 days in 2016. That seems to be it.
---
OMFG "investing" time into a video game is a dumb fuck ass thing to think. Anybody who looks at playing a videogame as an investment is already losing. It's just something for fun. Every game has a shelf life. If you go into exepecting it to last then you're an idiot. If you really want to invest in something try investing in furthering your education and making yourself more valuable instead of just being some bitter jackass.
---
It is not that I want niche skills so much as variety (unless that is what you meant and I misread).  I actually never used them, as I had necro rewind for my JP days.  However, I get their purpose it WvW, especially in the desert map with all those cliffs, and having to travel 1000 miles to get back into combat vs a quick heal skill on your way back up the mountain.
---
However, I kinda see fall damage as being just as useful/less as armour damage in PvE.
---
I'm 6000 hours in, raid CMs completed, occasionally mess around in PvP and WvW and this just isn't true if you've actually played WoW or FFXIV to a high level where you absolutely have to keep up with gear.
---
Everything you are describing - fashion, outfits, legendaries - are optional and don't impact on your ability to reach gear power parity, completely unlike WoW or FFXIV where you need to grind (gear, secondary power systems) to keep up with the power level of other players.
---
This would be such an amazing change tbh, would make viewer experience better too
---
Very nice :) I recently modeled my ranger’s [power soulbeast look](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/306856497382555648/636746702950498334/unknown.png) after the Olmakhan too, but opted to go without the shoulders and just got the cool horns.
---
No, there’s just a polarised community of those sick of Anets bullshit and the other side sick of bitching and moaning about quiznos.
---
FFXIV would like to have a word with you
---
Imagine believing all that money is going to the charity.
---
Because when it came out, it was really revolutionary. To have an MMO that vast and that well polished was a revelation. The systems in place were also good at retaining players. Like really good and it's likely one of the reasons why people would keep coming back to the game or stick with it even when they weren't enjoying it. WoW creates a real barrier to getting round the sunk cost feeling.
---
хэй!
---
последние несколько релизов не могу запустить дх12 вместе с arc dps, устанавливаю как _chainload, если ставлю просто как d3d9 то всё ок
---
просто ничего не происходит, даже лаунчер не появляется, запускаю от администратора, год назад всё работало.
---
что можно попробовать сделать?
---
No it isn't. You can have loads of negative discussions and there are lots of posts pointing out critical failings in the game.
---
Instead, it's normally positive posts that get flooded with a bunch of people either saying the game sucks or that they aren't allowed to be critical. When they absolutely are.
---
And honestly, this attitude is really tiring and makes this sub a completely dispiriting and uninteresting place to visit at times.
---
This guy is waiting to hear he can buy up to 10 templates.
---
To each their own, but I never felt like that. In its prime (to me) tanking was a blast as you had to juggle mechanics with off tank, use abilities to cc/mitigate dmg/etc, and generally as the tank you were sort of the fight conductor managing and orchestrating everyone’s roles. 
---
I never looked at my abilities. Just like I’m sure a high end raider or PvP/WvW player doesn’t. You play long enough and you know what/when/how to do anything you need just as if you were typing (without looking down at the keyboard). You had to as well. If you spent your time staring at your abilities you missed out on key bits of information about the arena/fight/mechanic and that could cause a wipe.
---
Don’t get me wrong I love the action oriented style of GW2 and to the same Wildstar. If GW2 had real and honest tanking in group content that would probably have helped a little bit. I’m sure a portion of my burn out was having to spend time grinding for gear for a class I wasn’t truly emotionally invested in.
---
That would be great honestly. Would be nice to have more adjustment options.
---
On the other hand you clearly expect that just because its wp, it should be upvoted
---
Ideally I wouldn't need to be looking at UI bars anywhere :/
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Glad to see some positivity on this sub. Been trying to get into FFXIV (4th attempt...), but I always find myself coming back to GW2. This game really is my virtual home.
---
If I were to just play PvE I'd probably only play in bursts by now, but WvW keeps me here--it just feels different from other games' large scale pvp modes. It's a shame the devs have mostly sidelined wvw.
---
I don't understand why people are so desperate to get some boosters and an unremarkable mini, is it really that big a deal
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again. These items in this release had no business being so ridiculously rare as they are. Especially not if they're needed for these achievements, they don't even look like special armor.
---
Some people love free stuff no matter what and rage when they can't get it  
---
Others collect the mini's .. so this i can understand the displeasure.  
---
and others rage because while they don't care about what they can get.. they do see it as Anet wasting time and resources of shit deals/competitions etc at a time when they could do with really good advertisement
---
*Laughs in merged language servers*
---
Legendary gear could still take stacks of damage to a certain point, but they would have no effect over the item.
---
Agree, never made any sense, specially after they removed repair costs.
---
Fall damage reduction should be a mastery too.
---
This one in particular is nice because it allows you to teleport into Amnoon without having to go through the first story instance, particularly  on new characters. The only other one for PoF has you starting out in Vabbi, so it's a bit of a walk if you haven't unlocked anything yet. (tho it is free lmao) This one came with the ultimate version of PoF, and isn't a bad price for what you get in that pack already.
---
Since Pof I replaced the music with Nightfall's theme, it fits better !
---
They could turn repair canisters into some "instant revive after you're downed" buff similar to the Mistlock Singularities in Fractals of the Mists.
---
If the player does not own either HoT or PoF, he / she will not have access to neither gliding nor mounts. If I remember correctly, there is one particular jumping puzzle that involves a griffon egg. You cannot survive the drop without the falling trait.
---
I hafta say, I preferred them too over Subway.  But the last time I went to one (and by that time 90% had been closed down where I live), it was a sloppy, incorrectly made, mess of a sandwich – which led me to believe I know why they lost all their marketshare and I haven't been back since.
---
Shiny Room for Shiny Bois
---
I left GW2 (after 10k+ combined hours in GW and GW2, and honestly I didn't want to but I didn't like the way ANet took the game) for ESO so this **MUST** be fake. Bye GW2, hi ESO.
---
obvious /s for the last part
---
tldr
---
tl;dr: Yes, seems OP is complaining about double teaming. (even though they probably aren't being double teamed)
---
Judging by the thickness of the outline and the distance between the two groups I would say it's Green and Red both bringing their zurgs there and looking for a fight out front. Green is probably the southern one and probably just came from Dan, and Red is the northern one judging by direction and looks less organised by the spread dots which is further explained by Red SMC and their confidence.
---
Edit: Dropped merch means it's probably just K-train fun for red side, or blue pissed them off somehow and they're going for BM taking t3s or it's just random merch and I'm overthinking it.
---
Game devs do a thing, reddit responds with overwhelming vitriol for a few days, then people get sick of it and start upvoting the saccharin, then other people post about the cycle, and then it gets old and everyone forgets about it. Welcome to reddit.
---
[The top three posts are an example of this.](https://i.imgur.com/yfFwI61.png)
---
I need help with finding a song - I've been running and leveling up an alt on Norn starting areas and I had to stop and listen to the song. It was really slow, building up with violins I think? It gave me big Nier Automata/MONACA vibe and I can't seem to find it (It might've been from GW1 sountrack or something?)  . How do I know which tracks cycle in the starting area?
---
Edit : kinda like this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Z0zO2KqGY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7Z0zO2KqGY)
---
Valid point, and take my upvotes. 👍
---
I agree with you on Stellaris. I stopped playing when they changed it to spreadsheet POPS.
---
Hi everyone, just added sets 8-13 (100 more codes).  Likely the last I have pending further notice.  I'll look for more but no promises.  I will be giving some codes out to GW2 streamers to hand out, so once I contact my friends who stream I'll let you know who will have them on hand for giveaways.  Check the main post for updates.  And sorry if I wasn't able to personally get back to you.  My inbox is completely full.  Thank you!
---
Hate to break it to you, but reddit is **the** place for any game. People like to act otherwise, but there's a reason why searching "Guild Wars 2" brings up the subreddit before the official forum.
---
It's not 2007 anymore and reddit isn't this "super secret club" that only the uber smart elite know about.
---
Something I’ve noticed about this sub is that the self proclaimed hardcore players who do nothing but raid and do fractals, are always calling everybody else casual.
---
I’ve also noticed that there’s a huge disconnect between the vast in game player base and the vocal reddit minority (the complainers in particular.) in game, a vast majority of players are just enjoying the game and they even call the Reddit community as a whole “cancer.” Meanwhile, the very tiny minority of people on this sub that actually post, an even smaller minority of vocal whiners have this inflated ego and think they **are** the community, that they **speak for** the majority and that if they leave, somehow that will destroy the game because supposedly everybody will follow suit. 
---
The reality is, when we say “just quit the game if you don’t like it.” If they actually did leave, nobody would really miss them and the game would be just as fine is it ever was. They try to turn it around and say we’re toxic for saying “just leave and play another game.” But really, we’re just saying that there’s no point in suffering something in life that’s optional and meant to be entertainment if you don’t like it. Like really, just go do something else and let the rest of us enjoy what we have. We won’t miss you, hopefully you won’t miss us so you can go have fun somewhere where you’re not bothering other people by whining non-stop about every minor thing.
---
Tl;dr- the Tiny vocal reddit community kinda sucks and then in game community just wants to have fun and vastly outnumbers the Reddit community.
---
Thank you! found a code in Set 12 (column 3, row 1)
---
I'd say that you should have to admit that you are not going to relate with new players though. The sort of changes that drive veteran players away after years and years (and plenty of time to burn out) may be totally fine or even positive for new players.
---
I would be so happy if Anet marketing dept, marketing the game, has this level of thinking. 
---
Unfortunately.....
---
So no, I tend to believe these may be actual happy users.
---
People arguing about MMOs, like most of the controversial comments in this thread.
---
Thank you so so much! I redeemed one of the codes from 12th set.
---
Well, you're ignoring the target audience of that review: Dedicated players. People who want to spend thousands of hours.
---
A game that might be fine for casuals, might be a waste of time for dedicated players. This is the case for GW2 too, I recommend it to people who just want to play now and then, but heavily discourage it as a "main game", because it doesn't lead anywhere, and you can't compete through achievement points either, due to temporary and daily achievements.
---
Set 12, row 3, code 3 (933B3K) - taken
---
Thank you for these codes :)
---
I agree. I’m a casual player and am constantly overwhelmed by the amount of content this game provides. I could see the hardcore players getting bored and frustrated with enough time spent in the game, but for me it’s by far the best MMO experience I’ve ever had.
---
I daily check for Phalanx armour skin to get back in store... Lol
---
I have one already then took a long break :) the game is all about what you make it and I've learned not to make it a job but to get on and do the enjoyable things I want to do and not do the things that I should be *required* to do. 
---
With this outlook I enjoy an MMO more especially when I don't make it my full-time game and I split it up in between that and single player games.
---
Thank you for saying it. Fuck this sub.
---
yeah, they really need to make a wishlist

Well what I mean is dedicated is a very loose term here. Putting literal thousands of hours into anything puts you on a different level for reviewing. Some people play games like they are a full time job and most games aren't built to be that. I'm talking about people that beat a game forty times and expect it to be different in the forty-first play though. At that point you have more than gotten your money's worth with the game and I don't think it should recieve a negative review because of it.
---
I understand games change, especially mmos. And when they turn to garbage then people have a good reason to negatively review games and tell people they should stay away.
---
Edit: a word because I'm an illiterate
---
Reddit never changes. :) But you are really godsent, this promo was unavailable to so many people. I hope karma pays back to you.
---
This right here. I'm so glad guild wars 2 decided not to have full on flying mounts therefore we get to still enjoy the terrain and everything in the game and he's right they put so much into their mouts and the physics of it it's incredible. 
---
if you are wanting flying mounts this is not the game for you....but if you are wanting to work toward the mastery of each of your mounts and experience the different aspects and abilities each one offers then give it a try :)
---
Your edit was complaining about people downvoting it. Call me crazy here but people who dont care about up or downvotes dont usually edit their posts to voice their concern about it. By that logic no one is forced to comment either when they see a post. Would you have preferred if no one commented at all or are you only looking for positive messages. Also for future reference dont mean you ill will but this sub is a terrible place to ask questions regarding this game as a good chunk of people on this sub dont even know the content outside of living world maps. But that wont stop them from pretending.
---
&gt; Then WoW changed....and kept changing. They literally made the gamean endless grind that unless you’re putting 5+ hours a day in you can’t keep up with those that treat it as a full time job. That’s right, WoW is now a job that you must grind endless hours even in dungeons and mythic+’s just to keep up it have a chance at the gear you need. And don’t get me started on metas and “you must do at least this much dps or kicked”. F that noise.
---
I just wanna preface with this... WoW was always a job. Even in vanilla. Leveling back then was a slog. Quests were a slog. Traveling was a a slog. Tons of grinding. The difference? The scope was smaller and everything was much less accessible. 
---
On another note. WELCOME TO TYRIA! Just avoid this sub Reddit and you'll do fine.
---
Yea, that makes sense. I think Signet of Undeath is a particularly bad case because the life force regen is used to fund the skills that form most of your healing output and having that shut down for such a long time is crippling.
---
"Smile and wave Taimi, smile and wave." - Braham to Taimi after the battle of LA in 2014, foreshadowing community culture 5 years in advance.
---
I'm not black so I haven't gone through and checked that out but that is awesome. To be honest its the little details like that that I'm glad makes this the MMO for you! I'm just glad they aren't giant jiggly titties like every Korean-inspired MMO with horny developers (yes everyone....I know there are horny developers in each MMO and to an extent GW2 is no different ;)  but at least it's not freaking Black Desert characters
---
No thanks. As much as the UI COULD use improvements, placing the boons and condis in places like that would just be more visual noise. And distracting as all hell.
---
Boons and condis need a massive rework in my opinion. Not just a UI problem but a general combat problem since this game tries to be both tab targeting and action combat all in one.
---
Community is great , anet pr on other hand is a joke.
---
haha, post about someone having fun in this game being so controversial speaks volumes about the game.
---
to OP, speaking from someone who played since gw1: enjoy it while you can!
---
Thank you!
---
No one has welcomed me yet.
---
Oh good wanted to give a heads up cause those game modes see little to no development. If thats the case and you have no expectations for any of that then yeah youll prob have fun
---
There's already plenty of events that have you go into an instance and get a small group of players together. Raids, dungeons, fractals, etc. Since launch of Bound by Blood I have never had a problem getting 10 people to show up for a Strike mission. The LFG has made it easy.
---
I never once got the impression that Trahearne got all the credit. Dude didn't even want credit. Or to even be a leader.
---
&gt;  there’s no point in suffering something in life that’s optional and meant to be entertainment if you don’t like it.
---
This is honestly the big point I wish people would understand. They've gone from engaged, to disengaged, to actively hating the game, but they won't leave. Some have even stated they're just here to troll. 
---
I'm at the point of "come back for the content patches," but I still have a fondness for GW2. I figure once other games cool off for me, I'll be ready to jump in again, so I still check forums and reddit.
---
Ply it or don't. It doesn't cost anything.
---
You've come to the wrong assumption about me and people like me. It is not that I do not want to hear criticism. Not at all. I believe criticism is extremely important and necessary. What is not necessary is hijacking every post with criticism, which is exactly what this subreddit does. There's a time and a place. Criticism is necessary in general, but it isn't necessary in a positive post that was not meant to discuss criticism. And just because a positive post mentioned that the positivity came from a place of frustration, that does not open an invitation to bring in the criticism discussion.
---
Yes, you probably paid for those window blinds. I have similar and had to pay for them.
---
You could, although that is a little overkill, and the added toughness will do more to attract stuff to you magnetically than defend you.
---
Wow, I never would've guessed that. That's so weird. But why though?
---
Yeah this sub is a terrible place to ask question when the vast majority of the playerbase unironically do not know how to play the game. Like that is an actual thing if you want genuine questions answer youre best bet would be to ask a friend with an adepquate amount of game knowledge or someone you trust. But if youre asking about LB viability...well honestly Anet made the game so that (no offense) any shitty build can work in open world, and i do mean any shitty build. Now if you want detailed questions answer about whats actually good for end game your best bet is staying away from this sub.
---
edit:  "The challenge is that the skill disparity between average players and hardcore players is extreme. We’re talking about ten times damage output. You can’t necessarily put a DPS check that the average player is going to be able to overcome without making the fight entirely trivialized for the hardcore. " Like thats a direct quote from Mike Z the vast majority of players do not know how the game works after 2k hours.

---
&gt; "play the game not the ui." 
---
What would that mean in pvp though? Throw things at the enemy and see what sticks?! Even in open world, you now need to know how read the UI. The best example was the Eye of Zhaitan in dragonbash. The amount players dying to retal, like moths in winter was not funny.
---
you are a typical guy who will defend his product of choice on the internet because you dont want to feel bad for buying it. This is why you should never trust possitive comments when you are buying anything online. You need to look for comments from people who own both or products you are choosing between. You are blind my friend. You will refuse to acknowledge any flows of mistlock. First you say mistlock dont have long load time.. and right after that you say loading time dont really matter... lol? Dude please.. You are rejecting the reality here. Of course loading time matter. Who like long loading times? So if you can choose quited fast loading convinience place and noisy, long loading convinience place.. why you choose the second one? Oh becasue I know.. because you own it and dont want to look stupid using that over the other one, that is way better. I get you, its ok. But dont force that false way of thinking to new players man. Be honest.

That's called artificial scarcity and it's intentional.

I suppose if you really want a mount you could go through that mission relatively spoiler free if you get someone to join you and ask them to run ahead doing most of the spoilery-stuff. Plus don't watch the cutscenes :D
---
we got a sherlock i seeee
---
&gt;I've a veteran 
---
What does one do to have his own veteran? I want one now.
---
Yet amazingly enough is basically a single player game
---
If you look at time spent with entertainment as an investment then you're looking at it wrong. It's just something you do to feel good while you are doing. For example did you ever play sports as a kid? If you did, did you go pro in any of those sports? If you didn't go pro in any of those do you view your time spent playing sports as a waste of time because it didn't pay off in the end?
---
Seems to be a stray discussion is one of the discord servers I'm on; it might be a way to make the expansion more appealing by taking away a base trait like this so staying F2P is more of a hazard and gliding/mounts are more appealing.
---
Totaly Not thats the Point
---
Reddit ist full of all ppl Casual Hardcore Hater whiteknights call EM what ever you want 
---
if only the by you so called haters would be Here all the Art and Goodwill Posts would not be here aswell
---
Ingame everybody is "Happy" even the "whiners" cause they want to Play and Not waste their time discussing but they are there playing the Game the Same way the "good ppl" are also in this sub
---
There is No tiny Reddit minority this sub is full of everyone 
---
And Just Like in every topic and every Media in the world negatives thrive disscussion more than positives
---
The group claiming you do here is the reason for the harsh Tone in this sub thers fighting against each other instead of discussing the topic 
---
Discussion is important 
---
praise is important 
---
Hateful disscussion is Bad 
---
Praise in the face of clear wrongs is bad
---
nice info but i dont like the idea of always slowly falling. the draw of flying in wow is that you can fly around and look at things from diffrent angles lol
---
Yeah its sad and they should communicate way more 
---
But the reason they do awnser more often in Art is that they cant Go wrong there
---
While on Balance disscussion for example their Word will BE Gospel and quoted If Something doesent Go AS planned in an instant 
---
Definitely a Problem where they and WE have to Work on to make Things better
---
Hi hi hi, my mate tested today your answer and ignoring the fact that he loves longbow he is impressed with the damage from the traits skills and weapon combination, ty a lot 😁😁
---
You have to be mentally handicapped.
---
I'll explain this again and see if you try to understand now.
---
VIP areas selling point isn't "it's faster than towns", it's convenience on a place that's 1 click away.
---
AND they are not slow to load either, at least not for me, so that is not really a problem with them.
---
Yes, I stand by my choice to buy it. Because it's a very good QoL, unlike you, who's trying to justify not buying it because of some deep psychological reason, and saying that "opinions of those who bought it are irrelevant because they are blind! So only those who didn't buy it know!". great logic bro.
---
It's a good buy if you do fractals are like QoL, shouldn't be a priority but it's good down the line.
---
No different from Ascalon Catacombs, but just smaller. There's some light puzzle elements and then a boss at the end.
---
Literally every MMO has a new player say this, yes.
---
Like grats you're having a good time but your experience isn't unique to GW2 lol.

A lot of the tracks in core Tyria are from GW1, so in case this one isn't it, don't be afraid to search the GW1 soundtrack for similar ones.

Not for much longer, I'd imagine.

what's a POPS?
---
I called about a dozen in my area. Most said they had no promotion ongoing and to check the website, one said they had a promotion but didn't know what it was, one knew exactly what I was talking about.
---
Sorry, wanted to write I'm xD
---
Or maybe that i've a veteran pass?
---
LOL
---
Lots of people in that mob have mentor tags up and are patiently guiding newbies through their first riot.
---
Oh it's these little yellow cereal-- I'm kidding, In Stellaris, it's the animated icons that represented the population on a Planet.
---
I bet you're fun at parties.
---
I learned, random people don't always like positive comments on reddit.
---
Changing the look of the launcher won't fix the fact that it's a fucking piece of shit. Why do I have to restart the entire game if I lose connection for a *fraction* of second? Why can't I relog from in-game login screen? This stupid piece of shit client can't even do that? Is the technology not there yet, like with patch test realms other MMO developers use, so their game isn't bugged to hell and back on patch release day?
---
Ah okay, thank you
---
No, I didn’t say that it should be upvoted because it’s WP.  The instant downvotes was my point

Why do that when you can just dip your toes in pvp?

Feel how you want man. I'm having a good time with the game. If it bothers you so much why even say anything
---
Good evening all,
---
After playing BDO and trying AA:Unchained, I've decided that I've had enough of those sort of MMOs and I am returning to GW2.
---
I'm completely looking forward to it and to give people an idea, I left GW2 after HoT was released but way before FireBrand was a thing.
---
I've spent most of the evening looking at builds, mounts and understanding the Meta but I'm completely overwhelmed and would just like some guidance from you all to help get me back on track.
---
A bit about me:-
---
* I was a player who was heavily involved in WvW back in Ferguson's Crossing (NA) but I'm going to move to EU soon.
---
* I'm really only interested in  Guardian builds that are WvW based for both group play (Firebrand?) and roaming (DH?)
---
Looking for community relied upon sources for the following:-
---
* Mounts - These are a completely new thing to me and I've already gotten the raptor. How useful are these for WvW?
---
* Guides similar to MetaBattle - Are there any other guides that people use to help tailor builds specific to weapons etc?
---
* Money - Back in the day, Silverwastes was the GO TO place to earn money but now where are the places to get gold?
---
* How viable is it now for Guardians to use Hammer and/or GS? I have the Juggernaut and Twilight and would LOVE viable WvW builds to continue using my legendaries.
---
* Stats - Have there been more releases of different stats from expansions?
---
I played wow since cata and i agree, wow bfa is a fuck fest. Too grindy with ridiculous systems based on rng (titanforging).
---
Im playing gw2 now and i am happy here. i hope u both r happy playing gw2 too.
---
Have fun and enjoy.
---
You're right, but it takes more time to get rank than getting the tickets required
---
Don't listen the the locker room guys bragging.   
---
Do what's fun, but do try to challenge yourself and grow.
---
maybe all im saying is there are people paid to do that, there was a post either on this sub reddit or the fallout 76 one, basically someone who at one point was paid by companies to make heart felt "i know people bash this game but im having a great time!" posts on reddit and other social media, as well as give positive reviews on amazon, youtube, etc. I spent 5 minutes looking for the post but i dont care enough to look farther. And yes there are a lot of paid shills on reddit just like on every other website
---
All mounts arent usable in WvW, only one, Warclaw, which is a WvW specific mount obtainable by collection which involved wvw activities.
---
Theres  [https://www.vabbi.eu/index.html](https://www.vabbi.eu/index.html)  this site, good for WvW builds.  [https://discretize.eu/builds](https://discretize.eu/builds) Fractals.   [https://snowcrows.com/raids/](https://snowcrows.com/raids/) Raids.  [https://www.godsofpvp.net/](https://www.godsofpvp.net/)  PvP.
---
Best place for gold rn is Dragonfall, which is map you get to in 6th episode of Living World Season 4.
---
You can check this one on the build site.
---
There have been, much arent used, but some are in some builds.
---
Yeah I know we had lots of reasons to think they were working on something but I don't think it was ever confirmed.
---
They may be inferior in dps compared to top tier dps builds, but it's still the dps with highest utility considering that it has strong cleave, very strong aoe cc, aoe cleanse and some aoe heal, which can be utilized on many bosses where those are needed.
---
Considering that many average or below average groups struggle with basic mechanics and lack a lot of those features, having a holo can be pretty beneficial.
---
Honestly they are fine, yes you could get better results with other classes, and/or easiest results but if you enjoy it keep with it. The thing to note as a dps is raid wise you want access to condi and power depending on the boss, so on power fights holo is fine, on condi you would need to be flexible to something akin to core condi engi or similar.
---
GW2 is a pretty good game, second only to WOW, but Anet has one the most totally inept PR departments in the field.  From day one it has been a steady series of colossal fiascos PR wise. They just don't know when and how to spin good news or how to ignore or placate bad news.  They have always had this smarmy PollyAnna condescending attitude towards their player base that pours gasoline on the slightest of PR fires.
---
I don't know what game you are playing but I've been playing for 7 years and am constantly experiencing progression.  There are so many layers to this game.  And beyond lateral progression like in WOW (and other MMO's) you get horizontal/Elite spec progression.  Sounds like sour grapes and a lack of awareness to me.
---
I lold. Take my upvote.
---
I did start working on one legendary, but got burnt out farming wood.
---
What's changed about dragonhunter to warrant a replacement for existing content?
---
Nothing.
---
&gt; It's real easy to be a great community btw when things go smoothly.
---
Exactly. Ofc people are nice in open world where chance of failure is &lt;1%.
---
Even the most toxic PvP player is nice when they are winning.
---
PvE community isn't more friendly, content's just easier and you aren't forced to interact with others for the most part.
---
&gt;caused me to just completely drop the issue I initially contacted them about
---
I guess that's a "*mission accomplished*" on ANets end.
---
HoT HP's aside (bring friends), that expansion is really the only part of the game where enemies can cheese as hard as you can. Most overworld you can just press buttons or kite and be fine, even if downed. But HoT mobs will blind you and then use a barrage attack that does 150% of your HP. The only real solution is to cheese them back. Spam your CC. Use blind fields. Anything you'd do for camp flipping in WvW. Learn which mobs you can deal with and which mobs you just wanna avoid (Smokescales and Bristlebacks come to mind). If they have ranged attacks, look into your projectile reflects/blocks. If they have blocks (Chak) learn to interrupt. HoT is 100% cheese, but so are you.
---
Your later definition of personal data is correct. If it "relates to you" and "can identify you" then it counts as personal data. This includes online usernames, character names, preferences, behaviours like purchase history, and so on. That said. If It can reasonably be anonymised (and the regulator takes a strict view on this as most companies actually fail to truly anonymise data) then it wont count as your perso al data anymore.
---
See here and read the recitals too: https://gdpr-info.eu/art-4-gdpr/
---
In addition, if the data can be combined with other data in the possession of the company, or that could reasonably come into the possession if the company, Then it still counts as personal data. That one is s lot harder to interpret but the guidance released by regulators and the European Data Protection Board make it clear that such co alterations must take place. Most companies simply don't understand this or aren't yet at a point where they are capable of this. 
---
There's a few things to consider here. Firstly, privacy is moving towards a risk management approach rather than a pure compliance approach. This is even encouraged by the board and regulators. Personal data is basically everywhere in an organisation and it's too resource intensive and cumbersome to achieve full compliance (and honestly impossible and ubrealistic). So companies manage it like any other risk and actively choose not to comply in certain circumstances if doing so is too low priority compared to other risks. They have to manage the compliance efforts like any other project and make decisions about how and where to focus their efforts and there will be times when other risks trump this one. That's ok. It's the only way to edge tively manage your organisation and there will occasionally be mistakes. A good risk approach will account for that and tolerate a certain level of issues so long as they don't go over a risk threshold. Those issues that do will be dealt with according to the appropriate risk management procedures. 
---
Then there's the fact that, to be completely honest, most companies still aren't fully understanding the GDPR, let alone all the other privacy laws and other laws and standards that apply to them. And believe me, there are many. I wouldn't at all be surprised if in this instance Arenanet have failed to train the staff well enough, or they have simply misunderstood. They are, after all, a predominantly US based company with global obligations affecting them. 
---
The last thing to consider is your rights aren't absolute. There are times when the company will have rights that trump yours. For example, if they require your datavto satisfy a legal obligation then you might not have the right to request deletion. But there's still more nuance than this which companies should consider when receiving such requests.

Mega props to OP for sharing the codes.  If he's not an employee, and someone is just giving him stacks, Anet should have just done a Reddit sub give-away.
---
"About fucking time my bag is almost bursting with ungiven up votes!"
---
Don't know if the metas of PoF are very played nowadays. They were always stacked when coalescence was released. The rewards for those metas give lots of elegy mosaics, besides the daily chests and the legendary bounties you can kill while waiting for the meta to start.
---
Also, if you have spare crystaline ore from HoT you can craft crystalline Ingots and the stallwart guy allows you to trade 5 every day into funerary incenses.
---
Holosmith in speedclears/recordruns -&gt; useless
---
Holosmith everywhere else -&gt; just as fine as any power dps
---
Holosmith isnt inferior, it just cant bring/utilize the strategies used in recordruns and speedclears. Seeing how only one guild is left actually doing stuff like that, that means 99.99999% of the time holosmith is quite good. It might not be top dps in arcdps if you go against a well played dh or pchrono or dd etc.., but holosmith is a very good allrounder, similar to power reaper. You bring cc, have stab, condi cleanse, aoe and st dps. Power reaper has more defensive utilities, holosmith is the more aggressive of the two.
---
Remember, in gw2 raids player skill counts for quite a lot more than class and gear.
---
300 ping is more than fine to be raiding and fractaling. My Australian friends and I always raid together at around 300 ping great. It’s not any noticeable disadvantage, and raids and fractals aren’t that hard in the first place so don’t require super fast reactions or connections. Just try it out really, it’ll be fine.
---
What’s not fine is if you spoke or dc a lot.
---
Hardcore players are bored and frusrated in every single game.
---
Thanks for the reply and all the details! Much appreciated!
---
I won't even try. They are all probably gone by now. Most people claim more than one when they can :/
---
Look for a guild that specifically does "Raid Training". Pugging is mixed but I actually did have a lot of good experience with it, so I wouldn't write it off just yet.
---
Learn W1 and W4 bosses, they're the most common training runs, especially the first 2 bosses of each.
---
Builds,check out Snowcrows, Warrior will often end up as a Banner build.
---
Ok boomer. Sit down and let's get some facts straight.
---
&gt;you guys are so in denying mode
---
**Mistake #1** \- Stop generalizing. Not all of us are in "denying" (by the way, correct term is **denial**\*).\* We're just laying out simple facts; Mistlock is by far the most QoL pass. Little to no movement requirement and direct access to instanced content are its hallmark features. Sorry if we're being realistic but it's just the obvious truth. And if there are really people who are in "denial", then they're just as dumb as
---
&gt;I know you spend lots of money on this vip area but when other people say its shit, it loads too long, too many anoying people running around.
---
**Mistake #2** \- Don't assume things about the people you're attacking as if you know them on a personal level. You don't know if they spent gold or actual money. I sure didn't use gold, so you're already factually wrong. And by the way, 1k gems is hardly " lots of money". It may be for you but don't push that term onto other people because you clearly don't know the conversion rates of other countries.
---
&gt;Dont just say "hey you can close your eyes, turn off your screen,
---
**Mistake #3 -** Don't put words into my mouth because I clearly didn't say that. Stop over exaggerating, it just makes you look even more like an idiot than you already are.
---
&gt;Dont be stupid please
---
**Mistake #4 -** Don't project.
---
&gt;You have right to love that area and I have right to hate it because of reasons that concern me.
---
**Mistake #5** \-The reasons that you gave are easily addressed but you somehow refused to do anything about it. Of course you're allowed to not like something that other people do, but your reasons have to make sense first, and yours don't.
---
Believe it or not, I too don't like all the sparkly stuff that some people have. But guess what? I've had my character model limit set to lowest, so I never had that problem. And do you see me complain like a child? Nope. I actually used my brain and did something about it.
---
*mic drop*
---
You can convert HoT Crystaline Ingot to Incense. It just 5 piece a day. VB and AB meta is basicly just log in for 2 minute.
---
Then doing dragon stand to get Crystaline Ore.
---
I've still got a bunch of ascended food I need to burn on my Guardian.  Need to take her to do some HoT metas or something and do this.
---
&gt;YOUR mindset is toxic, because you're trying to tell someone else what they should like, dislike, or feel comfortable with.
---
\*Proceeds to tell me how I should think\*
---
You can justify it all you want, being around negative and whiny people is just incredibly annoying. People can do whatever they want lol. I would much rather be around positive people then whiny ones that complain about any sort of change.
---
Did you like actually read my comment btw, because your comment is realllly *stretching* there.
---
That's the issue with almost every game. The easier and faster you get what you want, the less rewarding it will be. I remember playing really bad MMo pay to win long time ago and i was so happy after grinding a few key item and feel more powerful. You just need to find the sweet spot that will fits you
---
This makes me glad I'm always playing games casually.
---
He plays multiple games, not just gw2 anymore.
---
it's content released within a 7 year span not actually 7 years of content
---
it's barely a few months and this is assuming you are one of those that enjoys every detail..which won't apply to most people
---
 https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/
---
This page lists a number of discord servers specializing in raid training. GW2 Raid Academy if you are on NA servers, Crossroads Inn or others if you are in EU. I highly advise these servers over a guild because it’s much more likely you’ll find runs that fit your schedule!
---
Awesome tip, thank you for the reply.
---
If you are a decent player and have the will to remember the best rotation for the class you are trying to play you will be just fine.
---
Everything you read or hear is just the current generation's bullshit stigma. If they haven't seen their favorite Twitch or Youtube superstars do it then it is not viable and won't get any results. This isn't something exclusive to Guild Wars 2 but the community of the game is really high up their asses when it comes to stuff like this.
---
So my suggestion is make your own groups and play the game the way you want.
---
I'm not telling you how to think. I'm not telling you what to enjoy, or dislike. This is the same as the paradox of intollerance. Telling people what they can and can not enjoy is toxic, but if you like it, then your mindset is toxic and you shouldn't like doing it.  
---
You can justify it all you want, being around positive and brownnosing is just incredibly annoying. People can do whatever they want lol. I would much rather be around realistic people than hyperpositive ones that praise every failed attempt made by anet.  
---
Did you like actually read my comment btw, because it realllly explains how it's not *stretching* there.
---
 in GW2 you would be eating off the floor
---
you disturbed the circlejerk, unlucky for you
---
this sub is just for high fiving each other about positive garbage and silence any sort of disagreement

random new player: "i like this" +999999votes sextuple gilded

---
ignore the donkeys around here and keep being honest
---
That gets into the more dicey subject of whether or not ANet was lying ...
---
&gt; I wont comment on ele because frankly I dont think you know ele as well as you think you do or plain disagree. 
---
Oh I KNOW ele. I have the most experience with ele out of any class in any game mode more than quadruple any other class. I have played it many many times in WvW too. I plain disagree because I have seen most people play power staff ele, without knowing what they are doing. 
---
&gt; The meta will shift but both sides have the chance to adapt to a new meta. Having nobody die at all ever will not happen, especially in a game like gw2 where high end play is almost non existent. 
---
Of course there will be people who die, that's the case no matter the meta. Whether people die or not is thus irrelevant. However, whether GvG will simply be boring run around in circles with people slowly dying until one side wins with lots of sustain is something else. Noted that transfusion and revive skills are getting a nerf so maybe that will help balance things.
---
I mean, you can use whatever stats you want, but why can't you craft maurader? Is it just that you haven't levelled tailor high enough? If so that's totally understandable, but just a heads up you can buy stat selectable armor for 1g+500airship parts in Verdant Brink.
---
I definitely wouldn't go full soldier or anything since that will hinder your damage a lot, and I agree with the general idea that you want to prioritize offensive stats over defensive stats. If you want a little vitality boost, mixing in a piece or two of valkyries (assuming maurader isnt an option) might be a better choice than soldiers. Overall I'd go mostly zerker still, with just a one or two pieces of maurader/valkyrie/soldier/whatever you choose IF AND ONLY IF you feel like the extra HP would help you.
---
Here's a [super long video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RImXHc2KLbE) woodenpotatoes did on gearing for open world/story/solo content, if you're interested. It goes super in depth.
---
Like people who try play the "easy dps" class are actually playing it properly though. You should see the pitiful DH DPS numbers everywhere lmao. Back to the play what you're good at as long as it's a viable build.
---
stop! no! make them into a rune(old snowfall), make them a huge sacrifice to take(compete with an important trait), mastery maybe?
---
literally anything but remove them..many of us find great, albeit obviously situational use for them
---
remember when they merged them cuz they were underwhelming? full circle again, ugh
---
Well there's also the toxic casual element.
---
&gt; 10k gold is a lot of gold to earn, yes. It takes a long time to earn that, no doubt. But you need to make up your mind what's "hard" or you're just contradicting yourself.
---
Lol, I never said earning gold is "hard". I just listed how much it costs to buy a legendary armor. I showed how unlikely it is that anybody buy everything **instead** of doing difficult content like raids. 
---
Except from a handfull of people who have enough gold to buy everything and more, *nobody* do it this way. **That's** the point. Sure it's possible, but it's not realistic.
---
And you conplain about "doesn't understand"? LMAO!
---
&gt; For someone who doesn't understand the meaning of the word "disabuse" I'm not surprised at your lack of ability to form a cogent argument.
---
Not understanding my comment and then complaining and insulting because I "don't understand". Do this asshole behavior somewhere else. Insults aren't part of a discussion. Since you still have to learn that easy rule, this discussion is over. Ciao.
---
I doubt they'll give us 5 MP with this episode, but surely with ep 2 :)
---
you can also top the charts without knowing how to play if others know even less
---
it's a stupid stupid argument that makes no sense
---
It is also the way the economy is supposed to work: you are not supposed to farm any material at all, you simply are supposed to play the game, accumulate gold, sell the materials you do not need and buy the ones you need. It is when people don't to this that the economy starts to have a weird behavior.
---
If people simply played the game to get gold and buy the things they need instead of playing to get and sell materials, everything would be much better, both for people and in the game economy.
---
It's lot better than shitpost like 'Anet is banning players who used arc build templates' though.
---
What progression are you experiencing? Getting 1 AP for an achievement after you've unlocked all elite specs, all the legendaries you want and have three sets of ascended gear on all your characters?
---
Skins? Buying gemstore skins? Is that progression?
---
Edit\* In the end, I think it's similar to DPS. You can either take it casual and do 2k DPS, or you could try it efficient and do 40k DPS. I.E you can take it casual and take 7 years with content to still do or you if you played efficiently, finish all the content in a couple of months from the start.
---
Don't get me wrong, the game is still great for a beginner, but after 7 years... yeah... I don't know about that.
---
Be open minded to the whole experience because yes there's a barrier whether it be not knowing to start, being kicked from groups, or people getting upset. But learn to brush off the shoulders and keep going. Also learn the builds and learn them well try to hit at least 80-85% of the benchmark and ask questions and help with your dps.
---
Ah the 2 vocal extremes. Meanwhile there's the quiet middle which just plays the game, helps people once in a while, and keeps their sanity by staying away from Reddit.
---
As a veteran player who has been since beta of GW1 and has done almost all content in the game (many thousands of hours worth), I can tell you that I still love the game and it's still fantastic.  Sure, there are some things I disagree with (like how build templates were done), but overall, I love the game.
---
Some advice I'd give both your friend and you is to take your time and don't rush anything, including getting to level 80.  Explore and just have fun.  Mounts are nice, but for your first time through, it's great to experience things the way they were designed.  
---
Welcome to GW2! :)
---
That is why I am in favor of as many time-gated valuables as possible, to stop the speed-runners from getting what they want on day one and leave.
---
You mean the people that do the jump so the rest can just take their portal? 
---
Don't you mean other people should learn the jump so chronos shouldn't have to portal?
---
I just wish it had a guild tag attached to it.*[COOK]*
---
*pops metabollic primer*
---
No it isn’t
---
I thought I was being insightful, but damn dude. That’s the skinny right there!
---
I wouldnt say ranger is strong in wvw but maybe i need to find one first
---
The key is to ride the line between hardcore and casual.
---
Or, as I like to call it; being a normal player.
---
No, they didn't mix asian servers in.  There were international servers, and language-specific servers (DE, FR, SP).  Previously they were not linked together, but now they can be.
---
Progression in this game has always been very little, it was like that by design, it was planned to be this way during initial development 
---
This game was suppose to be the anti-MMO, as in they took away grindy components or removed/revamped some of it
---
This is why we dont have gear mills and quest mills with mandatory raids for you to get anywhere. Remember the fuss when Ascended rarities were added into the game?
---
**If you came to this game for STAT or gear progression, you messed up 7 years ago.** If you're staying here expecting this game to go the old school traditional MMO, I would say you're wasting your time
---
&gt; But the reason that upsets us so much is that we love this game. If we didn't, we wouldn't care and would just play something else.  
---
Exactly, but people just get frustrated and leave. 
---
My literal playtime right now is: Log on into mistlock sanctuary. Check T4 LFG, Check raid LFG. If I can be bothered, maybe check a dungeon LFG or HoT meta. Ask guild if anyone needs help with anything and either do that or if there's nothing, log off.
