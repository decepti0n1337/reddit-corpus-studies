The game is obviously less populated since launch day, but it's not dead.  It really depends on what you want to do, i.e. leveling, solo, or group content.  If you solo, it will seem more dead since most players are probably doing group content in the expansion zones.
---
Change your dodge from double tapping direction buttons, to a specified button.
---
Personally I'm just disappointed we still don't have a Guild Hall in the mists. WvW guilds need one that has WvW stats for testing builds &amp; small scale GvGs in their arena.
---

---
Then they could finally give us some Tower pieces to craft (Walls, Gates, Bridges, Corners)
---
&gt; I checked on my end and it's not me, is this normal?
---
No, it's indeed not normal to think it's not on your end.
---
Omadd's Machine was scrapped apart to create Taimi's Machien, which was blown up and completely irrepairable after the events of Flashpoint.
---
Taimi repeatedly stated that she couldn't figure out how to recreate Omadd's Machine. And that according to the notes she found, even Omadd wasn't sure how he managed it.
---
It was literally a one-of-a-kind machine. And it no longer exists.
---
if the game was unbearably laggy for everyone else nobody would play it in the first place, friend.
---
Only on T2 right now and just get randoms that just join without knowing anything about the fractal. And yeah i am :)
---
No, we were the ones who destroyed it. To prevent Balthazar from using it to kill two Elder Dragons and a world.
---
Why do people choose games like this, its free, just play it. If you like it, play some more! If you dont then dont
---
&gt; Including Primordus, who ganed the power to manipulate dead
---
By manipulating you mean reviving dead ones as well? If yes then you might be wrong since I don't remember that Primordus revived any dead corpses (not sure if he is able to revive his destroyers though). We only seen his evolved minions in Ember Bay and that is it. Not even one skritt was corrupted or revived as destroyer.
---
I’m guessing you’re talking about the living world seasons.
---
Yes, they are made for level 80 characters.
---
If you are looking for the story, sadly season 1 is unavailable, so you will have to read about it else where. Remember to play the expansion stories as well.
---
everything past the core story is lvl80 content. the order is core story -&gt; season 1 (unavailable) -&gt; season 2 -&gt; HoT -&gt; season 3 -&gt; PoF -&gt; season 4. a singular episode of such a season costs i believe 200-400 gems, and current episodes get unlocked for free by merely logging in.
---
Stacking sigils in particular cannot stack twice. It's a max of 25 stacks no matter what. That said, if you do wvw and use stacking sigils, you'll want to have the same sigil on one of your underwater weapons so that when you "swap weapons" it doesn't say, "They don't have this sigil equipped anymore. Bye  bye stacks!"
---
Sigils with an ongoing passive effect are only in effect while the weapon is wielded. They do not stack.
---
Make sure you've equipped the trait-line. You'll need to equip it in the 3rd traitline slot.
---
Wasn't talking about the karma, and the monetary cost is practically non-existent compared to the usefulness of three empty slots.
---
People are pretty fond of Istan, even with the nerf. Go there, find a train, and ask them what their methods are. I believe they run several metas in a row.
---
Dragon corruption is worse than a cancer. Cancer does not reshape your mind. It does not turn flesh into ice or fire or crystal. That is a poor comparison.
---
Besides, I never said that an icebrood is still a norn and not a dragon minion. I said that icebrood are still mentally changed - and that the example of "a former Svanir" that "is not mentally changed" was incorrect for my argument in two forms: 1) that he is mentally changed, and 2) that he is not an icebrood.

Cool story. Irrelevant, but hopefully it made you feel better.
---
Because in real life we are mind controled by media and goverment! ANet wants you to wake the F up and stop with the "obey and consume"
---
MK Ultra? Symbolism? New world order? 
---
I was browsing conspiracy sub for few hours now so it makes sense to me now more than to others. WAKE UP!
---
While I respect ANet's writers, it is an MMO's story they must tell. I think there are significant weaknesses, like how often conflict is resolved through combat, but I also think they're telling the best story in any MMO. Dragon-age storytelling is too nuanced and will not work in an MMO.
---
First of all, the game is very different from GW2.  Very.  Different.  The game is based around builds of chosen spells.  In general, you must find appropriate mobs, kill them, and steal their abilities.  Like GW2, it is very horizontal.  The difficultly will be finding the appropriate build to counter mobs and work your way through the maps.  The storyline is very good, IMHO.  If you play the game for fun and work towards the goals, getting 30 points is not very difficult, but will take you time.  Trying to get 50 points will take a lot of dedication.  Some things will take many, many hours of effort to grind out.
---
Noice, that would look amazing on my necro..

We got a lyssa?

Use it on your condi thief instead

Still is for thief btw

what do you think qualifies a deity as a spirit of the wild
---
Illidan, you're drunk.... go back to Blizzard. They need you way more
---
You wanna list those? I can always use some more slots
---
Making first legendary after 6 years or a map completion after 20 years will get more upvotes than this.
---
Scarlet really didn't control her followers, though she herself was fighting against being controlled to some degree. All the dragons, of course, are similar. However, the idea of a powerful boss having minions do their bidding is pretty much how you'd populate a world with enemies.
---
I mean we still have bandits, and flame legion and nightmare court and Inquest, all of whom are bad guys who aren't controlled. And if you were Nightmare Court you'd argue that the Pale Tree controls the rest of the Sylvari to their detriment.
---
The thing is, every bad organization of any kind, even in the real world, exerts control on it's followers, usually through fear. Evil regimes from a western point of view rule with an iron fist and exert dominance that way.  That's how "evil" gets people who aren't necessarily evil to do their bidding.  Another tool is propoganda, which convinces people they're doing the right thing but again is another form of control.
---
If you want to fight one big bad guy, it's not going to be as interesting as if you're fighting armies. Those armies have to follow that bad guy. In a world with bad and good guys, that means you're going to have them either mislead, intimated or controlled. Not seeing a whole lot of other options. 
---
Unless we go with the bad guys not being bad guys, but just guys who want something different from one do. Welcome to the world of heroic fantasy.

&gt; Only one map was needed to use a teleport to friend in order to reach without going into other maps to reach the destination
---
Which map? Why?
---
Sauce?
---
&gt; little bird on some twitch stream
---
ah yea, the top source for news
---
So after layoffs, before lw season finale and new lw s5 (which was not heartly welcomed by community and probably ncsoft bcoz money), little birds on some twitch streams are saying anet is working on essentially Skynet 2.0.  All those pugs you wondered how they could be so clueless were alpha and beta versions of ANET's new AI technology to eventually take over the world.  Remember its not official, just rumor.
---
The gods aren't there to allow or not allow anything anymore. Menzies should have the power to seize control of things since he should be the most powerful being in the mists aside from the dragons.
---
ironman dies in endgame
---
It's actually explained, explicitly in game with Awoken. They aren't totally mind controlled(Or, it's not in the typical sense of mind control). They are compelled to follow joko, but almost always have their entire personality and self remain in place. Some Joko purposefully strips away, but most remain fully aware.
---
It's described by the one elder (who tells you about the cave Koss is in during the story) that you are compelled to always obey anything Joko says. Some fight it (almost always unsucessfully, Koss is the only one and he did it by obeying the order's explicit phrasing, but twisting what he actually does to fight joko. He's exiled to the cave by being ordered to Guard it, and they tell everybody to never remove him from the cave for that reason.), but most give in, whether it's willingly because they already revered Joko, or unwillingly. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
You see this with like the Wurmmarshal. She was headed to destroy the Commander's army, but once the compulsion to march south disappeared, she remained where she was. The one we kill right before Joko openly respected the commander, to the point of hailing the Commander's actions as being the best battle she ever was in, and Joko saying he wouldn't bring her back at all.
---
Not an unreasonable thing to assume. Making an expansion takes time.

Because Balthazar is a human god, and it's much easier to harvest a bunch of villagers then go hunting hydras. Plus there calls into a question of whether a hydra "soul" is better then a human one.
---
When legendaries used to be salvageable. They didn't even drop anything unique either, just 3 mithril ore.
---
Inquest, Flame Legion. Iffy on Nightmare court zince they don't outright mind control, but it's more like brainwashing. Same with the Svanir, at first (until they become Icebrood).
---
You get all the different races starter Waypoints when you create your new character. Not many people know this.
---
Here is a great guide for experiencing the story in order:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/
---
scarlet and her coalition of factions consisting of flame legion, dredge, Krait, nightmare court and aether pirates. none were mind controlled.
---
One of the hero points in an early pof zone is an Awakened general that just decided to walk off and go take a literal dirt nap for a while.
---
This game has the best combat system ever in mmos. there are 9 classes but each class has 2 elite specializations which completely changes the playstyle. also there are so many builds you can create in the game for pvp. thats at least 100+ different character builds so you always get to fight something different
---
Necromancer, bro. play necromancer
---
You should easily get to 30 if you play every content and enjoy the game naturally, aside from the first campaign in main tyria being incredibly boring(very shallow story, infinite boring trash packs after trash packs), elona and cantha is INFINITELY better, so don't let that turn you off.
---
Getting to 50 is really an ardous and mindnumbing task, so unless you are the type of person who enjoys clicking trees in runescape all day, you will have a very bad time.
---
As above, you generally won't have much issue with your ping when it comes to build. 300ms ping on average here and I don't feel as though I'm ever falling behind due to latency on any of the builds I run, even those like Mesmer and Elementalist.
---
The agony bubble puzzles on fractals, however, kinda suck. But at least that's not a class-specific thing.
---
yes, all champion bags shall be open currently at lvl 49-53.
---
it says one the site what EV @25% chance means if you hover over the text, but can can explain it here too:
---
EV@25% chance = the expected value if gear is first rolled by  type ( weapon, light, medium, heavy), and then by specefic item
---
You CAN have free will and have an absolute order.
---
Dragon minions have no free will. They are static unless commanded by their dragon to do something. Moreover, when their Dragon dies, they become erratic/insane without their commands. They do not recover with very, very few exceptions (the former Mordrem Guard found alone in the Festival of the Four Winds).
---
Awakened have free will in every aspect other than direct orders from Joko. Many will still say and do things of their own accord even without Joko present. And when Joko is killed, they do not go insane. They each have a different reaction, as seen with the various factions. Some believe/want to believe that Joko will return. Others are glad to be rid of his orders, etc.
---
The issue with the Awakened that ANet needed to touch on more/more consistently, is that there are varying levels of Awakened. Some Joko makes fully conscious (Iberu), some he makes conscious but enthralled; capable of rational thought but unable to resist Joko's will (Koss), and some he makes mindless/almost mindless (the shuffling Awakened/the Awakened merchant in Amnoon).
---
Missing gemstore horns.
---
Oh, believe me, I know :P Many a curse word uttered over discord with a mate. I assumed that was what they were looking for, something that is good for 1v1 combat, no matter how cheesy the build is. Same with Ranger, to be fair with their pew pew longbow skills. 
---
If that kinda 1v1 isn't your cup of tea, look into the Necro builds. I enjoy the Reaper builds, as they have a nice level of CC and Damage output which makes 1v1's pretty fun.
---
In terms of reward, decent gold, ascended drop wirh unique skin, mag shard is also a good way to buy ascended gear easily, especially trinket since raid trinket offer all stat available. But mostly, lots and lots of fun.
---
After doing a raid with a garbage guild, realizing the kind of stress it puts on you and knowing you only did a certain amount of DPS, I'd rather get that legendary armor from WvW
---
&gt;Inquest, Flame Legion. Iffy on Nightmare court
---
These are not major antagonists.
---
How would that work?
---
Flame Legion aren't really antagonists. They are villains. There's a difference.
---
Let's take DBZ for example. The Cell Saga.  Dr. Gero isn't the antagonist of the Cell Saga. He is a villain. Cell is the antagonist of the Cell Saga.
---
I have a ryzen cpu, 16gb of ram and an nvidia videocard

I was having really unstable and bad fps, had to run the game at low.

Your patch basically doubled my FPS. I can run it almost maxed and getting very smooth FPS. 
---
amazing. thanks!

I just got this achievement today by accident with 3 seconds left on the timer.
---
The group was formed in T4. very high dps, everyone knew what they were doing. we missed one crystal but otherwise killed everything very fast
---
Lol, added an extra 0 in there somewhere. Math, how does it work?
---
Holy shit, I'm pretty new to wvw and that was a lot of words I didn't get lol
---
Mouse Child has stopped turning every object into a sex toy, and now is being stalked by a wow veteran with curiously small pauldrons.
---
You don't even need to practice with some classes tbh, play something like mirage or scourge condi, and just spamming all your buttons will do quite decent dps. I'm not saying putting effort is bad, but there are choices for these type of people who don't want. Last time i tried, i was doing like 7~9k dps on golem with mirage just by letting my clones do everything and afking.
---
Are you getting downed and then immediately rallying from your conditions?
---
&gt;Dragon-age storytelling is too nuanced and will not work in an MMO.
---
I don't think this is a storytelling issue as much as it is a world building issue.
---
it is much harder to balance when there are even more stat varieties they have to consider, with even more possibly broken strong builds. As such, your choice of amulets is limited for a reason.
---
If you want a little bit of everything, go celestial. Else you'll have to make some cuts
---
oh nice. I knew the others but not the last one. this will save some time lol
---
I get that they need to make microtransaction money, but I would absolutely spend hours on achievements/crafting for some of these skins.
---
"Bleeding (8s): Inflicts a papercut to enemies which is most unpleasant"
---
Isn’t the whole thing they’ve been pushing expansion like content in LW episodes though? Kind of making it seem like expansions aren’t their way forward
---
Okay, I noticed you saying the same thing to a lot of people, so let me hit your bullet points here.
---
It is absolutely possible to role play in GW1... to a point. There are very few branching paths in the stories, so your role play will be limited to finer details like skill build and what kind of side quests your character will or won't take on. Oh, and whether or not you recruit certain Hero characters in Nightfall and Eye of the North.
---
The difficulty is very much there. As a solo player, you will be facing challenges designed for 2-4 players. Yes, the story is 100% soloable, but you would want to start in Nightfall to get Hero characters. They will be key to actually beating the harder fights, and there are Hero builds circulating around that will let you be the only human in the party and still do fine. I had a hard time beating the second to last mission in Nightfall, but I managed it with Heroes.
---
As for character customization, you have I believe 7-9 profession/classes to choose from depending on what campaign you make the character in. Factions and Nightfall each have 2 classes that can only be picked as a primary profession if the character is made in that campaign. You also get to pick a secondary profession, which is initially limited to the selection from the campaign the character was made in. But you can change your secondary profession later on (I believe you have to do a quest for each new one, but then you can switch between your unlocked secondaries any time), and can access the campaign exclusive ones by visiting that campaign and doing the required activities. Beyond that, you have your build: attributes to assign points to, and skills to acquire and set on your bar. Certain skill values get better as you rank up the associated attribute. And then you have the fashion game and stuff, as always.
---
If you're looking to get free stuff and are willing to put in A LOT of time to get them, go for GW1. $20 is a great deal. But if you're expecting it to look or play like GW2, that is not the case. There is no jumping, map completion is tedious, getting everything you need to hit 30+ HoM points is a lot of luck, tedium, and toil. That being said, the story is fantastic, the difficulty is very much there even in normal mode, and Hard Mode is just that much more intense.
---
I don’t play war but I am pretty sure you are looking at old info, with the beserker changes this patch (last week?) power berserker should be very doable and viable.
---
Thanks for your response. How do when this 25% chance comes into play? Is this why I pick a medium armour class?
---
Funny you say this. I recently returned to the game, and started a new character. I went to Path of Fire first because I'd already seen Heart of Thorns. I've been killing everything easily in PoF, but when I tried heading back into HoT for skill points and pets, I kept getting insta-gibbed by anything with an event.
---
They'll literally take me down in like 3 seconds.
---
Well, there was the Giganticus Lupicus in Arah. And the Great Destroyer. And Glint.

Sadly, we've not had the pleasure of seeing Drakkar yet.

I'm terrible in english so I'm not gonna ask you to argue, I will not be able to correct you. I don't think you're going to be objective or even able to anyway.
---
Hard to get sarcasm in your world right ?
---
Heel, I'd buy gems to get my hands on more armour sets. I have never, and will never, spend a cent on outfits - they're just to one dimensional.
---
while true, all of those examples stemmed from early gw2 and not with any of the new villains they've introduced
---
The plot of the LW Seasons begin after the Personal Story (fighting Zhaitan). Unfortunately, Season 1 was designed as temporary content and ArenaNet leads refuse to put time aside to bring it back beyond a very, very shitty recap in-game. While there is that short cinematic, I would recommend watching [this three hour video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d17gwV4vXOg) when you get there. While not perfect, it does a great job. Season 2 follows that, then Heart of Thorns, Season 3, Path of Fire, then Season 4 (with Season 5 upcoming). You can see the order of plots in the Story Journal.
---
I'm a huge fan of the hidden deep lore of this franchise. I can't get enough of it. Unfortunately, you're right, there isn't much to dive into as we're given surface-level details at best.
---
We don't know much about the gods, and their history only goes back 2,000 years. The last Elder Dragon rising was over 11,000 years ago.
---
&gt; It doesn't necessarily have to be about the current story line
---
That's the big problem. Especially with the current setup for Living World updates, pretty much any inclusion *does* have to be relevant. This is, as far as I understand, because of a few reasons.
---
- Each map and their achievements is pretty self-contained, so feeding information across a few maps would not really work out. Not only is this structured via achievements but also just a part of the Living World pay-to-unlock system. (I sincerely this whole issue goes away with LS5.)
---
- ANet's policy is "it's only canon if it's in-game." And while I have no idea if they have plans for deep lore exploration in the near future (or at all, honestly), I think they may be afraid to make any clues about it in case they want to do something totally different in the future (even though they can chalk it up to unreliable sources).
---
- And honestly, I don't think they have much of ancient Tyrian lore decided on. It's not like it's secretly written somewhere for them to reference (I mean that would be awesome but it's not all that realistic in this case). Someone would have to go out of their way to think of details to feed us that also wouldn't mess with future developments, and that seems to be more effort than lore tidbits are worth for them right now.
---
I hope to see all this change, and to see ANet more willing to have unrelated content included for the sake of world building, but these are the major issues I see for the time being. Again, I'm really hoping the big shake-up coming with LS5 will address a lot of the issues I have with the current LS structure, therefore opening a lot more doors for artistic freedom and cohesion.
---
I'm really rusty on raids, haven't done them for a while (Have 5/6 pi3ces of Envoy). What's good to grt back into it nowadays?
---
[deleted]
---
I like that! Feels like a cool organic way of coming of age that we don't get to fully appreciate in-game.
---
rainy year\*
---
It's really funny to me because the no-jumping barely bothered me. Like once I tried hitting spacebar instinctively and was like "oh right, that's not a thing here" and that was mostly it.
---
I just don't feel the need to jump much in GW1. The maps are based around finding paths and the scenery is mostly just for making a cool environment.
---
This coming from a guy who was teased by friends because I instinctively bunny-hop in Halo for no reason. Idk
---
Ty ! I went for a young Norn, that’s true. But it’s probably a bit hard to read since I tried to incorporate some adult features, I felt like Norn would look more mature at a younger age already. 
---
And thanks, I will ! Loved making this one.
---
So in essence the humans in GW are like Orcs in Warcraft?
---
&gt;the most stupid thing someone ever said on this subreddit
---
... today.
---
Anytime I try and change it to windowed fullscreen or windowed mode it crashes
---
Join deadeye, and watch your enemies health bar drain faster than your dual pistols unload actually finishes. And if that doesn't work than just stealth and do it all again.
---
No, I'm fine with that, I'm not fine with trying to do a mission and the game freezes / desyncs every 30 seconds
---
I originally got into raiding for no other reason than because I wanted the White Mantle Portal Device to make my CM fractal runs cleaner. I joined a few training discords, moved onto pugging after a few weeks, and now a few months later still find the fights so much more engaging and epic than anything I'd done in the game before. Some of the fights (Gorseval, Sabetha, Xera, Dhuum) just feel... huge, for lack of a better term. The only thing better than the bosses are the evocative environments we fight them in.
---
It's different from any fractal fight and different from any World Boss, because every decision you make could start a chain reaction that wipes the group. You have to force yourself to trust other people because there's virtually nothing you can do to singlehandedly carry most fights. And yet, after nearly every sub-10% wipe, I feel like I am improving, even if just infinitesimally so. Failing due to stupid mistakes is frustrating, but I know I've caused just as many pointless wipes as most others have.
---
I know many static groups have many raids basically on farm mode by now, but in my experience, pugging raids has led to some of the best, most frantic, most frustrating experiences I've had in the game. I'm sure I'll get far more cynical and impatient with raiding as time goes on, but I'm still at the point where I find a sense of wonder in raiding that I can't find anywhere else in the game.
---
Raid drops basically consist of exotic/ascended items + liquid gold. A full clear translates into 80-100g including the drops and salvagable items. You also can get exclusive items from vendors with raid currencies and u can go for legendary armor which can change stats and runes at any time. Also having a legendary ring probably coming with new wing.
---
In general raids are worth in terms of raw rewards as its the best source of ascended equipment since fractal ascended drops usually dont have the new expansion stats. They offer the most challenging content in PvE and the loot although not amazing is still good enough for a weekly clear. 
---
Time restraints are tough especially in the beginning as people might fail, training groups explain mechanics and usually have to change players throught the run. It gets better as you progress and become better but static groups usually expect people to stay for the whole duration of the run. In the end if you are interested in raids you will have to commit to some degree and not make excuses. You either want it or [not.](https://not.You) People who are interested usually find the time to fit them in their schedule. 
---
DPS checks are very easy in this game. Also achieving decent dps is easy as well since there are very well explained guides for all builds and you can freely practice at the golem whenever you want. Everyone is hesitant at first for the same reasons you are but that feeling just goes away after 1-2 tries on a boss.
---
That's right, I forgot they did that!
---
One thing in mind in regards to WvW.  I would avoid Blackgate if I were you.  Sure, they may be the best server in WvW, but all they do is zerg stuff to death over and over and over.
---
Enjoy your ban.

---
dont trust the damage on the tooltip for this i guess, go to the golem in the aerodrome and test a big damage single hit skill with/without the sigil, preferably an aoeskill that doesnt require targeting so you dont start autoattacking it and can check the combat log more easily.
---
&gt; keep in mind that the loudest people are not the most.
---
I mean, they provide some pretty solid arguments. GW2 has a decent mix of casual and dedicated players, and it should try to keep that whole array happy if possible.
---
It's not a good look for new players to go to a new map and find it almost completely abandoned, and avoiding that kind of relies on keeping it engaging for dedicated players.
---
Just because this subreddit only represents a portion of the GW2 community, and only a portion of the subreddit actively advocates for better LW implementation, that doesn't mean it isn't important to a lot of people. Just some people have more experience and are able/willing to voice their concerns.
---
I dunno, I just really disagree with the mindset that you presented there. A vocal party being a minority doesn't mean something is inherently a non-issue. I, for one, agree that LW could massively benefit from addressing those issues, far beyond just what appeals to the dedicated playerbase.
---
Yeah I had to do a double-take and well, begrudgingly accept it.
---
Because it works dammit.
---
part of why we don't know is because GW1 exists. it's set 250 years ago; and the entire "previous cycle" of the elder dragons awaking and the ancient races fight against them is so integral to our plot that  the more we know, the more the writers would write themselves into a corner.
---
- when the Gods brought humanity to Tyria; it was a rather young place; the Elder Races were in decline while the current main races hadn't uh; flourished yet; so there wasn't much in terms of civilization.
---
- The Gods did not come from Tyria; so their history from before Tyria cannot be found on Tyria.
---
- Humanity doesn't seem to remember a time before Tyria though; in part most likely due to them arriving nowhere near our part of Tyria (I believe they first landed in Cantha then moved north through Elona to Orr &amp; Kryta) 
---
- Koda (and the Kodan) are perfect material for an expansion or potentially repurposed from content cut early in development. there was only 1 [kodan](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Kodan) in GW1; and he was a Dwarf. There is no explanation for that race existing (and we've been way further [North in the Shiverpeaks](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/guide/?v=4&amp;x=-151.625&amp;y=891.25&amp;z=2) in GW1 than we can go in GW2)
---
- Elder Dragons rising / sleeping is supposedly a cycle; so they may have _always_ been; and they tend to wipe out all while they are active.
---
- the Elder Dragons being on a cycle means they've been around for a _while_ but they hibernate; they procreate (see their champions) and they can apparently be defeated (though honestly; I'm not sure if they are actually _dead_ or if they're just absorbed/disolved until they're _split/reformed_ at a later point; since you can clearly see Kralkatorrik channel Mordremoth; Zhaitan &amp; Balthazar during _that one scene_; so maybe if they're all destroyed Tyria gets _remade_ for the next cycle)
---
- yeah no; we don't know; our races aren't _old_ enough to know; and due to the world having magic; a traditional evolutionary world progression isn't necessary; I kind of like how the origin of the world is not a concern though; it often leads to prophecies and all-encompassing-devouring-bad guys as a result; I like our more abstract, unpredictable forces of Nature. plus we have a [multiverse](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Infinity_Ball) to contend with!
---
Baltazars minions is pretty much the same magic as the foefire ( a spell from one of his relics). Except thos time their souls were put in obsidian armor.
---
Honestly this makes me laughed so hard!

You get better at DPS/mechanics are as learn the encounters. Don't expect to be hitting his numbers you first runs. Raids have their own skins and an alt path to earn ascended gear, that's something to some people. Others get the satisfaction of conquering and then mastering encounters.
---
Thank you!

With the new berserker changes you can probably zerg with GS and arc slice x2 before jumping out of the fight and Rifle bursting. Not efficient but it's a reasonable way to play rifle warrior... Just make sure you're not being reflected, or pop an unblockable.
---
You can probably roam with it too.
---
There are plenty of things that live in the mists that aren't spirits and vice versa. 
---
Kralkatorrik certainly isn't a spirit. WvW isn't composed of spirits. Ghosts are probably spirits, but of a fundamentally different character than spirits of the wild since as far as I know spirits of the wild aren't assumed to be dead or related to death in any way. 
---
It sounds like a "spirit of the wild" is something that lives in the mist that can project its presence into tyria in some way, but it's obviously way more specific than that. The point I'm trying to get to is that what a spirit of the wild is or isn't is almost certainly defined by norn culture first and foremost, and is probably just a way of conceptualizing phenomena associated with forces of nature. if anything, "spirits" as they manifest for norn are likely just animal ghosts unrelated to _the Spirit of X_. In that vein, phenomena associated with jormag would be similar to phenomena associated with minotaurs or wolves or owls or whatever. 
---
The only real pain point for that imo is the existence of Owl, but I take it that it's largely a cultural death and that the norn are ignoring owl-related spiritual phenomena because of their pseudo religious obligation to do so. I seriously doubt a spirit of the wild has any influence on _anything_. 
---
If there were more to go on that'd be one thing, but this is a severely underdeveloped part of gw2 lore. Mostly headcanon.
---
Raiding offers the best combat gameplay and you learn how to make specs synergize.
---
Which is very true, and tbh very sad as well.
---
Yeah, that's not normal. There are some people that have had some issues specifically surrounding cut scenes, but not desyncing every 30 seconds. Definitely not common.

All builds are ok, you just tend to lose damage when the rotation requires dodging and weapon swap, including offhand weapons/kits/conjures/attunements) because it takes awhile for your skill bar to update to the new skills.
---
Some builds hurt more than others but its still possible to get top percentile dps with 300 ping with any build.

---
Not the OP but since we're discussing necros, what's up with the massive amount of fresh necros I've been seeing lately?
---
I decided to hop back on gw2 and try necro from scratch and sort of relearn the game while trying a new (to me) class. Almost every event I dont solo has like at least 50% necro players. I thought it was confirmation bias until it was mentioned in map chat a couple times.

&gt;  no amulets come with condi dmg without a direct dmg based stat
---
Deadshot amulet. Precision is also a condi stat has it helps proc condi traits.
---
&gt; I get that healing doesn't appear with toughness because they are too strong a combination for bunkers, but with the existing amulets to get both stats
---
You basically answered your own question. The reason the selection is limited is because anet explicitly doesn’t want certain play-styles in PVP (i.e. bunker).
---
I am however curious what kind of combinations are you imagining that would result from mixing amulets?
---
I mean after some advices people made here I have to say content is definitely still challenging but nonetheless easier when I was first time there, try to look through some advices people made here it definitely helped me, also vampiric rune is your best friend, easy 50% heal on those pesky raptors
---
The 25% vs even - In short, trust the even EV, as that assumes that you have the same chance of getting a staff as you would a pair of medium gloves, while the 25% is assuming that you have the same shot at getting a piece of medium armor as you would a weapon.
---
What stats do you run for power chrono, if you don't mind me asking?  Every guide I see has something completely different.
---
Go for it, nowadays everything is doable with heroes/henchman.
---
The only thing which could happen is you realizing what a shit show GW2 is after you've spent some time with the original.
---
Heh, also did the jump to Linux recently.
---
I can confirm, GW2 runs pretty well. I'd say my framerate on Windows is relatively similar to Linux. Linux seems to be even more stable in stressful situations (zergfests, etc.). I can not test this in detail, because I don't have a Windows installation anymore.
---
Just one thing, I had constant crashes when the launcher started with the D9VK installation and dumped it after some failed attempts to make it run. Someone pointed out that the default DXVK slider in Lutris bumped his FPS dramatically. And it somehow actually did (did not try before as it made no sense).
---
I have some problems with windowed fullscreen and 144hz, may be a plasma thing, I'm using fullscreen for now.
---
Vsync off also helped with performance.
---
Setting shadows from ultra to high made a big difference in fps stability for me.
---
Besides that, I'm pretty happy with Linux. My favorite game works great, nice! Now on to Adobe CC... a whole different beast.
---
He was both. Before his fall, he was often called god of wisdom. After his fall, he was often called the god of secrets.
---
Just as Kormir is called goddess of knowledge, truth, and secrets at different times. The four words (knowledge, truth, secrets, wisdom) are ultimately referring to the same thing.
---
The position, the role, is ultimately "god of knowledge". How they dress it up differs, but that's what both of them are.
---
As far as I know outfits are specifically made for  the gemstore. Armor sets are made for ingame. At least by todays standarts. If they would not be made for the gemstore, there would be no outfits at all. It is not that you loose skins due to the existance of outfits. You are getting skins on top that otherwise would not exist. So while I can understand the frustration over outfits from a fashionist I gladly take them instead of not getting them at all.
---
Regarding you convertion idea this topic comes up nearly every other week. Short answer is: It seems not possible cause of the underlying systems that determines anchorpoints for different armor pieces within different armor types. At least not without a huge investment of developer time to redesign every single outfit three additional times after redesigning the outfit into different pieces. The effect would be that you would pay for a complete outfit armorset as much as for six different armor piece skins (like the foefire shoulder skins for example). I don't think that more ppl would buy them if they are coming with a cost of 2,5k to 3k gems.
---
No, they do. I just forgot about that step when writing that comment. Caledon, however, remains unnecessary for non-sylvari.
---
You shouldnt. Getting into raids is a very epic jouney that rewards you with unique weapon and armor skins on top of an amazing feeling everytime you manage to beat a new encounter. Just dont do the mistake of going into non training pugs for anything you have not practiced yet. Getting called out for literally being a beginner is nothing you want to hear for a while.
---
&gt;oh wow that´s it guess I renamed it to gw2.exe sometime ago when the 64bit client left beta status
---
de we really have to talk about them again?
---
1) I don't really know what to tell you. You could entirely spend your time doing the PvE/PvP content if you'd like, doing world bosses , dungeons, raids, etc.
---
And yes, exotic gear is largely good enough for most things, but there is another tier, ascended, which you need for specific content (fractals). A large part of doing end game raids are for things like legendary gear, and for cosmetic purposes, but the gear grind isn't really a thing. If that's a major problem for you, then that could be a problem.
---
2) how are you leveling? events are faster than exploring, which in general is also faster than just doing hearts, which are also super boring.
---
3) There are RP guilds, mostly centered around divinity's reach. You can get skins through in game play, but some of the really fancy looking ones are gemstore outfits.
---
HOLD ON! Dungeons contain bits of story, too!!
---
No, you're right. I could have clarified that better.
---
I'm referring to a stance they took up mainly regarding data-mined information and forum posts. So yes, the published books are definitely canon, but scrapped ideas that linger in the code and developer insight is not considered "canon" until it is officially published in-game.
---
I point this out because leaving ancient lore in the nebulous void of "well it never made it into the game" gives them endless opportunity for creative freedom should they ever address it in the future. Otherwise, they may have to dance around previously established ideas similar to [Mursaat Lore Tablets](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mursaat_Lore_Tablet) which contradict details established in Arah explorable, but still follow the same events.
---
I'm a casual WvWvW roamer, and i don't like to be in the middle of the fight...i just help from distance how i can. I will try this build.Thanks
---
Agreed, I made comment on YouTube when they first release the video about this too, 
---
For the running animation, the wing movement and shape (look like some feathers) looks a bit too close to the griffon, it work just could be better.
---
While Sinister and Grieving are both about as good as Viper, they're also just about as hard to acquire. If you just want a cheap, effective set to use while working towards a more expensive crafted set, buy a set of Rabid (Galrath's) or Carrion (Brutus and Sheena's) armor off the Trading Post. It'll work 90% as well as Sinister/Grieving/Viper for a fraction of the cost. Just replace the runes with Superior Rune of Balthazar any time you're using a set without Expertise.
---
9k is like, what a support Chrono should be hitting on the Golem. Definitely not good for a mirage. In an actual raid it'll be even lower.
---
You've basically just provided an example of why people need to be practicing.
---
Took me quite a while to realize it wasn't Duke's expression upon the Mouse Child's realization of his towering presence.
---
this is becoming one hell of a meta ride and it's great
---
To be fair people shit on WoW here just as much especially those who never played it.   
---
Also I'm pretty sure a lot of people here would downvote or simply ignore somebodies cosplay of a no-name character from a game you don't know about.
---
Breaking sequence, I know, but wanted to get this one out of the way before Ep 6 rolls in this month
---
This goddamn season, yall, what more needs to be said?

Oh shit i am getting worse from now on? Just when i started to feel good T_T
---
Actually these outfits really make me sad. They could have been same epic god lore related dungeon to get them. It's a pity it's just outfits
---
See if one of your friends wants to join you on a 1-80 pLvL session, snag some boosters, food/utility that gives some extra exp, and do what you enjoy.
---
If you like PVP start there with a Lv.1 character to see what the gameplay would be like if it was at Lv.80 unlocks, I feel like the solution could be as easy as finding a class you really enjoy playing.
---
Don’t worry too much about your concerns, most of them are either already taken care of or aren’t as bad as you think.

Fashion Wars can be a pain from time to time with all the clipping, but there is a lot of really cool things you can do RP-wise.

If you make a char look good, you’re doing something very right.
---
Really awesome! Great job!
---
Gj TJ!
---
But i agree with mori, back to raids with you!
---
Well, things definitely changed since I played other mmo then. I just remember playing months casually in wow and ending half way from max, or playing half year in linegae2 to end up having one level in week of grind.
---
During levelling, of you don't like just exploring, I recommend: do events, those orange marked open world quests and whole chains of them. Do dungeons, they are opening at lvl 30 and every few levels you get another one. Do personal story. Opens up at 10lv, and then every 10 lvl you get next chapter. This gives a good chunk of exp and decent leveling gear.
---
About stats. When you open hero panel you will see things like power, ferocity, toughness and other. Majority comes from your equipment, some specializations can add or subtract a little more. When you boost, you get average dps/tanking gear for your hero. I believe (but I am not sure) that your thief have "soldier" prefix on equipment, and this gives you some power dps and a bit of defense.
---
If you want to be fully power glass cannon dps then you should get Berserker prefix. If condi, then Viper. Some classes use ultimate healing Magi or support healer Harrier. There are a few more meta min-maxed prefixes but boosted ones are never BIS. So, to see full potential of your build, you will eventually need to swap gear for something better.
---
Unless you don't go for speedrunning, then you can do whatever you want. Mix power, condi and defense and be hybrid everything? Go or it. In open world almost everything works. In endgame team content not really. Versatility is replaced by focused roles.
---
With that statement, i should have said "no amulets come with condi and tanking stats only". Deadshot amulet is still a very offensive stat distribution where the condi build balance issues came from investing in Condi Dmg, Vit and Toughness (maybe a little healing) exclusively to create very tanky, high damage builds. Under the proposed change, you could move Deadshot towards a more tanky version, but you are still limited by the fact that the condi amulets with higher tanking stats like Rabid still dont allow builds to go too far into the tanking stats.
---
I appreciate your curiosity! 
---
To take the above example a little further, I've tried to create a viable condi ele in the past with almost no success. The results were dismal, but even with my lackluster theory crafting abilities I found the issue to be survivability compared to the post nerf d/d Cele builds I tried with reasonable success rates at the time. There were no condi options with similar distributions of healing, toughness and vit that would be useful to even test a more burning and bleeding centered build. With a combination of Deadshot and Rabid amulets, I'd have:
---
\+975 Prec, +280 Vitality, +450 Toughness, +1125 Condi, +280 Expertise
---
This gets armor to about 2300 and HP to about 14400 which is leagues better for an ele than either the +900 toughness alone (11k HP - toilet paper in a fire to condi pressure) or the +560 Vit (17k HP, 1880 armor - getting 2 hit on the reg. with the limited mitigation and healing available to burn ele)
---
I'm pretty confident that i could make a closer to viable condi ele with that stat distribution, let me know what you think!
---
Recently I've been trying to make a symbols guard for brawling, but I want a little bit of concentration without giving up both toughness and vitality. Thinking Seeker's + Valk would make it viable how I've configured it atm.
---
1. Go back to ArcDps website and read the section that is in all caps titled:  **arcdps: gw2 dps meter (and general metrics tool)** 
---
2. Your mouse has a scroll function, so scroll down on the website to the sections :  **its not working** and **reporting crashes, bugs, and suggestions**
---
Well, I mainly play PvP for dailies, i dont plan to play higher ranks ATM. Something like [this](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Guardian_-_Burst_Burning) build for guardian? And [this](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage_-_Power_Shatter)one for mesmer? Seems weird for me that a mesmer is one of those classes  I'm looking for.
---
Hey, can you recommend a class that is similar to Shadow Priest (DoT class that ramps up damage over time and gets stronger and stronger the fight goes?). I know that Thief is the closest to Rogue but that class felt too hard for me tbh.
---
The point some people remember things from books, games or movies they experienced and some don't.
---
And there is nothing wrong with either.
---
I'd personally prefer mounts over waypoint fast travel but I'm sure you understand WP's being a thing how useless basic MMO mounts would have been. Thankfully today we have amazing mounts that are actually useful
---
Is this the real TJ? monkaMega
---
Because gamers are a fickle, and needy bunch. Look no farther than people bitching to Respawn about how Apex Legends has only had one big update in the two months its been out. People are decrying that as a dead game, and there are still millions of players, talkative devs, and a year long detailed road map.
---
Basically, people are dumb.
---
&gt; The forged likely followed Balthazar before they were turned
---
They did not. Maybe some but most weren't forged out of free will. Balthazar stole countless souls from Domain of the Lost and imprisoned them in metal constructs and forced them to fight. 
---
Herald of Balthazar even says this when you put her out of her misery:
---
&gt;Herald of Balthazar: Give in to his will. I too tried to resist, but I failed. And surrender makes the pain more bearable.
---
The rabbit fills that role quite easily, you don't need flying, just a 250g QoL :p
---
Are home instance nodes worth it?  I have never thought of investing in it but it seems like it could yield some easy extra gold
---
I had same problem with chrono. Problem is I just dont understand how to play this class, no matter what build or gear i have, and i just dropped it. I find playing engie and guardian more satisfying, they feel like OP in openworld, and other game modes. Holosmith most comfortable cauze i dont need even switch build while go in pvp or dungeon, they are very similar, and i just love crazy mobility with these boots :D
---
Every race and gender have it's own Voice Acting, also all important NPC. 
---
Story, imo, is great. We get new story chapter along with new open world map for free every ~3 months as long as you log in during that 3 month window. With every new chapter, previous one becomes locked in gemstore (unless unlocked, then it stays open forever). They are like tv series seasons but we call it Living Story. Now we have LS4E5 and E6 (season finale) is airing within next 3 weeks (we hope). This means that LS4E5 is already unlocked for you forever because its current episode.
---
Story goes: 
---
Core game, typical fantasy story from zero to hero. This one have branching chapters, depending on your choices of race, hero creating questions and further choices. Ending is ultimately the same, to get some cannon feeling. Kinda like Dragon Age 1 but with much more beginnings and one ending.
---
LS1 - unavailable because it was more like an experiment. There is movie recap in game instead.
---
LS2 - this will be locked for you in gemstore. Really boring and surprisingly hard in some places. I also play for story but I also recommend to just get a quick recap from another player instead of playing it. It's HoT prequel.
---
Heart of Thrones. Now things become more interesting. Mostly linear, with few branches. Story is much much better, with ascended top tier equipment as a reward after it's done. Gameplay is harder and progression is gated behind mastery system and your knowledge of jungle layout. Really, really my favorite part of whole game when it comes to map design and mastery system. Feels like Legacy of Kain games where you can go in some places but you will see locations hidden behind some kind of exploration mastery like gliding, using jumping mushrooms or wind updrafts. Best if done before mounts because they just break all this system.
---
LS3 - masterpiece and current LS standard. Every episode from now on, gives one new open world map. Lots of easily accessible ascended trinkers and top notch story with some twists. It's PoF prequel.
---
Path of Fire. This one is easier than HoT but have those amazing mounts. They really feel alive. Storytelling is great, and finale is epic with a cliffhanger (well, maybe not for you because you can play following story any time)
---
LS4 - current story. Depending how long you play, more episodes are available to you, definitely EP5. Story is epic, full of heartbreaking moments and twists. Last episode poster teaser is made similar to avenger endgame poster so figure. We all await it, it's gonna be huge! You might want to avoid reading spoilers when it airs, because you are weeks if not months to catch up with the story. So far it's more like PoF continuation than any upcoming content prequel.
---
Yeah those are fun burst builds, the mesmer is probably significantly harder though. If you're playing for dailies, you may have more fun looking at the class you like the most, looking at the build guides that you're interested in and customising it to your liking. This will require a bit of research to understand what the tradeoffs are for the changes you make, but it'll make you a better player and customisation is fun! (for me XD)
---
Another approach is to try builds until one gels with your natural playstyle preferences.
---
I hate you, Monstrum. 
---
I love you, Monstrum. 
---
Why must you hurt me so?
---
he was not prepared for this
---
Elder Dragons are not violent to their own minions though. Similar with gods, if we see humans as their collective minions. Of course in some cases we see a god having more specialized humans and attacking other humans (Abaddon and margonites), but I believe there are some infighting among dragon minions with different dragons (if not props to them for being peaceful). We also never see minions belonging to one dragon fight amongst each other, but we can see that among humans (believers of one god can still fight with each other).
---
When humans came to Tyria they expanded and created conflicts with many other native races. Sounds a bit miniony to me.
---
Some hunter rolled need on it
---
Warrior has decent access to unblockables. Can run Arms for that guaranteed crit on burst and the auto-signet of might trait, and can put Signet of Might on utility bar too.
---
It's not really B+ tier or something it's just a janky build that bursts from 1200 range and bails.
---
Used their services for years, never noticed (and can't even recall) if golem was pink.
---
Oh boy, here we go...
---
Scarlet going from simply "Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy mashed together" to someone that desperately tried to save herself from corruption and not only failed but lost her mind in the process almost redeemed her entire character and it's a pity we only found out this late
---
A lot of classes can use builds that do both Power builds with high upfront damage and also Condition damage which is DoT's that ramp damage up over time.
---
Best Condition damage builds at the moment are Condi Firebrand(Guardian Specialization), Condi Mirage(Mesmer specialization), Condi Renegade(Revanant specialization), Condi Berserker(Warrior Specialization)... Pretty much one exists for every class, the ones I mentioned are just the best in most circumstances.
---
"turning down" cus' of extra step doing it via imgtfy

Or maybe she's going to absorb Kralkatorrik magic and become a God? Since we dont have Aurene anymore and Kasmeer seems to carry the blessings ;)

You won't die if your enemies can't reach or see you.

Deadeye.
---
" I'm not a fan of exploring maps, et cetera "
---
Sounds harsh but than it is not your game. Exploring makes a huge chunk of the game and is the one factor that differs gw2 leveling experience from other mmos where you want to skip over them as fast as possible. The game doesn't change at max level. You will do the same things while leveling only the numvers don't go up anymore. You even need materials and things from low level maps / characters on max level and skipping over this content will simply force you to do it at max level anyways. Because there is a downscaling your skipping to max level will not even net you with a huge boost. You are dishing out a little more damage - for sure - but it is not that big of a deal in the end. The most active ppl are investing a huge chunk of thoughts on how to get those precious materials so yeah ... exploring even rewards you with some of the most valuable things ingame.
---
Like others said already it is not WoW-lite as a game. Wow even starts to implement things from gw2 for quite some time because it is so different than what was there before. Also - if you are solely switching from wow for raids in gw2 - prepare yourself for a long periods of doing the same raids over and over again. Raids are not a major feature for gw2. There is a more hardcore like community but raid releases will most likely occur once or twice a year. Not more. And once you understand the mechanics of gw2 you will even find that raids are by no means the hardest content ingame or even in the genre. That is why the most ambitious players are trying to clear raidbosses / raidwings as fast as possible or with as few ppl as possible.
---
We don't have space for every little question from every person on this planet. That's why we have search engines.
---
It is mostly the second method, but you forget that you can manipulate the "canopy" by using walls and cliff edges, thus effectively shifting the flight cylinder around, and keeping yourself with enough juice and within the allowed radius, even though you travel a lot.
---
&gt; There are RP guilds, mostly centered around divinity's reach
---
Maybe on NA, but as I've heard most RPers on EU are either in Amnoon nowadays, or in things like their guild halls (and I basically always see some in chat when I'm in Rata Sum, so I suppose they're there too)
---
A lot of speed leveling is basically just staying at near level content. go to hearts near your level and always prioritize events and story instances (though there are a couple bad events, they often give progress toward hearts, meaning both rewards for doing an event). You should keep in mind that there are multiple zones for every level range.
---
I also recommended skipping straight to the start of path of fire on your boosted character if you own it. The first mission unlocks a mount for all your characters. You don't have to worry about spoilers if you've also seen the path of fire trailer, and a mount makes a world of difference in the leveling experience.
---
Also i'm of the opinion is that thief is the most uninteresting class in the game due to how initiative works (for pve) and they're aggravating to open world with due to low cleave. So that might be part of it.
---
Yes because youre still alive when you bomb the group... now do that when youre downed yourself?
---
hmm could you give me some of your jui... ear milk, it sure must taste great.
---
To the Greeks it meant more something akin to the personification of emotion, transcendental and eternal. To many other religions, like the Romans gods are more like exemplars of lifestyles.
---
Gods are a bit like stars: a beacon to follow in the darkness.
---
So in a sense that means that gods *are* fiction. But that does not devalue gods, it elevates fiction to being divine.
---
Prob not a good idea to have kept reading.
---
Just small question. Are you holding the weapon in your hands ? It happend many times before that people were testing and forgot that they were not holding the weapon but had it in their secound set.
---
Yeah exactly, even doing solo roaming I can do a gift every 2 evenings of casual play.
---
Doubt there's going to be a minimum hover height because then it would overlap the skimmer behaviour, making skimmer mostly obsolete. So i'm afraid that unfortunately if you move you will eventually have to touch the ground.
---
I use Carrion and Balthazar runes at large events where my computer can't handle everything going on. The extra health makes a huge difference and the damage is not bad.
---
Really nice track!
---
Because you can drag anyone to your side and force them to do everything. Mindcontrolled minions wouldn't disobey their master. Simple trick.
---
what is this? hasn't the boss only been up for like 4 seconds?
---
Dont forget to relearn your rotation almost every balance patch!
---
&gt; So the "BEST" way to win coverage wars on EU is by quitting your job which is plain not feasible for most players; and related to what is considered very unfun gameplay by most of the players. This issue was repeatedly outlined at the start of the game, more than 6 years ago. On top of that, there are zero rewards for winning. 
---
This is only relevant for the top players, who actually want to invest that much time. WHo actually want the full WvW experience.
---
The rest, the "normal people" who can't play that much. They simply can't have that. Because it takes time.
---
The new system now allows the hardcore players to form alliances and match up against each other. And the casual players will end up matching up against each other as well.
---
That's the point of the change.
---
And yes, you expectations are simply ridiculous. You expect a competitive game-mode that is specifically designed around the time you can invest. Either you want to play it comewhat competitively. Then you have to organize with other players and invest time and effort.
---
Or you don't. Which is fine. But then don't expect to be able to play competitively. Or switch to PvP. Which seems to be what you want. Small matches you can play in short periods of time.
---
Anet still cant ban me
---
and more people are joining me for free farm atm
---
You are just a bad player, simply get better, you can make anything work in open world lol
---
Bet you don't even CC blue bars. So you don't know your class and are too lazy to try shit so you fail and will never improve and hope someone does it for you. Get better.
---
First to clarify things, you don't play gw2 to get better gear and be better than others because of gear. You play it because you enjoy the content, want to achieve things and get conviniences.
---
Second i played wow since release for a good 6 or 8 years i don't remember, until the late pandaria exp and from my experience gw2 is so much more fun, iam never going back to wow. I play it since release as well. 
---
Because you come from wow i can tell you 2 things that give you a little edge over other starter players and you can grind them. First one as mentioned is ascended gear. Ascended gear gives like 5% stat boost. Now the second is tied with ascended and is called infusions. It is like gems and you put them into your ascended gear. Each one can give you up to +5 to one stat and you can have 18 slots active( 10 from accesories, 6 from armor, 2 from weapons)
---
Now if you are looking for things to do here are some: 
---
1.Fractals to reach 100 level and then farm t4 dailies. 
---
2.Pvp season to get shards from pip chests and start crafting pvp legendary armor. 
---
3.Map meta events for map currency and loot . 4.Max your mastery level from all expansions to get the extra abbilities, bonuses.
---
5. Wvw. You can either join a blob and have large scale battles (like 50 vs 50 vs 50) or roam alone or with a small Group and gang / have small scale battles.
---
6. Do the adventures in expansion maps Which are fun!
---
7. Check out the activities like South sun survival. It is a battle royal like hunger games!
---
8. You can check the raids but getting in will not be so easy as New player. Dulfy has some good guides you should check for them.
---
9. Start a quest for a legendary weapon, but this is locked behind a mastery in cental tyria.
---
Here are some things i Quickly thought, there are so much more to do. I hope you stay with our community and have fun!
---
Exalted managing an underground cockfight ring spin-off pls

There's the archive I link on all of them :D

The two under Sieran are Faren and Tonn. The bunch on the left are the original warband
---
As for being chosen....if we go by what Odgen said, Joko ending as dragon daughter-food was *foreseen*. The future might have set in stone further than we might know
---
As far as trinkets and armor goes, I've seen a couple guides say to go with 1 armor piece assassin's and either rings or accessories as assassin's.  Does it matter too much which or should I just go for what I can grab?
---
I can get such numbers because i can generate 25 stacks of might due to Phantasmal Swordsman and the trait Phantasmal Force. Beside that like EveningPause0 said there are quite some damage modifiers in the traits and I was using undead slaying sigil and potion (each increases dps by 10%).
---
By automated crafting I meant to have ability to craft item without manually refining required materials. Scribing is especially painful right now. Also, maybe it could allow us to make automated mystic forge. Crafting lodestones or clovers is what I hate most.
---
That's interesting. How would a native executable compare? I'm asking since the performance difference might be smaller than previously assumed, which might allow Arenanet to just use this as their official Linux client. I wonder how many GW2 players still have a windows partition exclusively for this game.
---
This is what i was using for this solo:

---
Night sigils are undead slaying sigil, utility food is the undead slaying potion﻿
---
Note that this is a build made for solo gameplay and is a lot worse in group content compared to builds on SC website for example.
---
Does that mean we'll get craven commander tags?
---
Thanks for the info, I appreciate it.
---
I would sell 50, to keep "deposit all" relative, and spend the gold on whatever, or keep it (gold is ideal way to store extra materials), maybe expand storage more (depending on daily play time might be useful)
---
Basically sell everything above virtual cap, to keep "deposit all" working for everything that could be filled in within a week.
---
We are getting more masteries we are literally getting 3 next episode.
---
People say this, but it only goes so far, and only really in w1-4. Carry scourge isnt going to help a group who cant do cannons on Sab, not going to help a group chucking out 5k total DPS on KC, wont stop people from stepping on crap in Deimos or CC Saul, etc. (Though I will admit it is pretty ridiculous on w2...but even there wont stop people who dont know how to shroom.) Its a meme, it has a lot of power in bad groups, but raids have enough one shot(ish) mechanics that it doesnt really matter too much.
---
Thank you for reading my post and your contribution.
---
Clovers are % chance to get and crafting is always 100% that you will craft that item. Those I would leave in the MF. But I do hope to be able to craft lodestones with the 500 Jeweler update wich they are planing to do one day. That would make me so happy. Recipe would be the same as in MF just now we would have the option to do 250 at one go. Also the scribe yeah I know your pain. Especialy when you are doing lvl 400 decoration and you need all those little ones under it. So not automated crafting but more of a completionist crafting. So when you click on a decoration to craft it would immediately craft planks into paper and so on without you serching for it. That would be awesome to have just dont know how they would add it into the game on the "story" side. Only way would be a magical way to enchant your crafting tools to craft for you what you desire.
---
Use the rez-trait before it‘s explode? Teapot did it at Deimos.
---
&gt; Why she would want to help stopping mordy?
---
Not getting eaten for her magic reserves seems like a priority, to be honest. That's why they left, right? If they stayed, it was inevitable they'd eventually be drawn into conflict with the dragons because they're enormous glowing dragon-snacks and Kralkatorrik has now figured out how to get into the Mists.
---
I'm too afraid to read that. Seriously. Can someone take the bullet for me and report back?
---
Core Tyria mastery are not really story related so those could fit in there. Once a while they are making those reworks, like upcoming cooking so new enhancements cam just air any time.
---
And about bestiary there could be whole side story related to it like an arrival or some kind of archivist or maybe hunting guild.

Largos are a culture of Assassins, and read a little bit like some kind of underwater version of D&amp;D's Drow.  Not necessarily hostile to us or evil, though certainly not warm and cuddly either.  
---
Pirates and bandits are a rather large portion of the enemies we run into, especially in Krytan zones.  While they may be somewhat of a moot point to this discussion, the fact is that they are hostile for reasons other than being mind controlled or magically corrupted.  
---
Ascalonian Ghosts are magically corrupted but not necessarily being mind controlled.  The curse placed on them forces them to seemingly relive their last moments before death while blinding them with anger.  Their base personalities to seem to remain, and some in AC even seem like they could have been reasoned with in spite of the curse.  
---
All I got for now.
---
Ahhhh, okay. Does that mean it gets faster the higher you get since it sticks to a steady XP bar or does it take the same time per level?
---
We're done...

If you're bound by fate, then you souldn't fret about suffering because it will happen regardless. You just gotta keep pushing forward.
---
Yes it is there like 5 years now. It is called southsun survival, iam not sure how to access it now days, one sure way is if it is daily activity where you can access it in Lion's arch. Iam not sure if you can access it from southsun cove. In wvw you can join empty maps and just roam for battles if you like small scale.
---
Good idea if open world wasn’t face roll already
---
Astralaria was a very fun and interesting journey focused on star charting the night sky all over tyria.  Pretty cool idea.
---
I would say to do whatever the hell you want because only the mods can stop you, and they don't seem to be interested in that.
---
I won't say I look forward to each new release, but that's only because I really don't think about it. It's always interesting to discover there's a new one though, and when I do discover it, it's the first thing I click on, so yeah there's that.
---
1. I know it is, most people said it already. I disagree with exploring the map and role-playing having that big of a connection. Yes, I need to know the places where I wanna RP but as long as I know the lore of the places (Which I usually read about or do the questline while leveling) I won't -need- to explore the whole place... Expect it is needed for the RP or something.
---
2.What does horizontal progression mean? 
---
3. Yes, I know how the fashion looks, I think that's very interesting. Again to the RP, a friend of mine on ArgentDawn (Biggest RP Realm on WoW) told me he tried to RP in GW2 but couldn't really find anything. Do you have any suggestions to find it in-game without externally looking for it?
---
Mouse child :D never gets old

Asshat is commonly-used, yes.

Deimos is extremely telegraphed. If you do dhuum with some dumbass pugs that decides to run in an attack, face tank cracks, pops it on accident etc etc you are not going to res the entire party

22 is fairly subpar. People who actually practice and do well do 30k or above on Largos.

They had layoffs but they said it barely if at all affected their GW2 team size. Other projects were canceled though.

I don't see the playerbase dwindling anytime soon. I'd say 5 years minimum but even that remains to be seen.

I don't think GW2 comes even close to FFXIV in terms of story telling. GW2 has the cool aspect of having fully voice acted dialogue and interesting maps to play for the first time.
---
The reason why we have so many mind controlled enemies is also probably because they can pretty easily make a branded/corrupted/whatever version of an existing enemy instead of making new animations.

A person ON a mount jumping around in Vale in the circle and whilst he is ON the mount we are not getting the camp. It litterally takes us minutes to get him off the mount because it is Vale and Vale have a lot of los spots to play around with. We get him off the mount, we instant kill him and now we get the camp all whilst people making fun about was it not suppose to be impossible to contest with a mount. Another example. North Camp a few days ago same thing. Now 3 people had to get the player off the mount whilst swearing again over what went wrong with the patch.

Yeah I know... I've been playing since BETA. I'm just saying that they can sell individual pieces, its not impossible, obviously they would need to adjust the price, but i doubt the player base would be happy spending 2000+ gems on an armor set.
---
I'm not upset. But you're being deceptive . You're not really saying "I prefer regular skins"  , you're saying " I don't like outfits , so stop making what I don't like and only make what I DO like." . It's the same as people who demand a raid every 3 months , when only 10% of the population raids. You can like whatever you like, but quit being an entitled baby who demands the game conform to YOUR idea of what is appropriate. They still introduce in-game skins at a decent rate , so outfits aren't fucking up your preference. We recently got the defiant glass weapon set , the orchestral weapon set , and the new LW is bringing a new armor set in all 3 weights.
---
Outfits for me is not fashion wars. It is what anyone and their goldfish can put on and you now look like 10.000 other players. 
---
How is that even fun? 
---
The fun for me is to find my personal look in the wardrobe system. And if i don't find what i look for at that point i throw an outfit on until i either do find the right look or wait for future drops.

What in the Eternal Alchemy did you just say about u/Portrait_Prophecies, you little glitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the College of Dynamics, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on the  Inquest, and I have over 300 approved essays. I am trained in skritt warfare and I'm the top elementalist in the entire Metrica Province militia-krewe. You are nothing to me but just another test subject. I will wipe you the snaff out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on Tyria, mark my rusty words. You think you can get away with uttering that pseudoscience to me over the leylines? Think  again, quack. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of revenants across Tyria and your frequency is being traced right now, so you  better prepare for the EMP, underachiever. The bolt that wipes out the  pathetic little thing you call your golem. Your career is over, progeny.  I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can zap you in over seven hundred  ways, and that's just with a Snafftek remote. Not only am I extensively  trained in organic combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of  the Rata Sum Peacekeeping Krewe, and I will use it to its full extent to  wipe your miserable research off the face of Tyria, you little amateur.  If only you could have known what unalchemical retribution your little  "clever" comment would bring down upon you, maybe you would have held  your tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the  price, you academic failure. I will excrete scathing critique all over  you and you will cry in it. Your career is over, bookah.
---
And then when you take in to account there were only three individuals at Balthazars defeat (Kralk, Aurene and the Commander) wouldnt that mean that each of them were that vessel? Since Aurene is gone that only leaves Kralk and the Commander and Kralk absorbed most of Balths magic. Is Kralk the vessel for a god?
---
This bring up another question though. In the past, the dragons absorbed the magic of the races of Tyria, before the human gods appeared on Tyria. What happens when a dragon from one world absorbs the magic of a being from another world? Kormir said a battle of the gods and dragons would destroy Tyria, but we have no idea what happens if a dragon absorbs an other-worldly gods power.

Do you even know how why of this works? ...lol.

solo builds aren't usually raid builds and often use different stat- / rune- /sigilsetups to be more selfish / effective in solo play.  
---
the general statement is true tho, you can copy a build from there and work with it to be more effective in solo play. for example using more assassins gear pieces to reach the critcap without buffs like spotter and banners.

This is actually caused by gw2 itself when two instances are launched in fullscreen mode at tge same time. Each game wants to "grab" the mouse for its own which results in a unpredictable behavior. Try using the window management under "advanced settings" or check the "windowed" box under argument settings. Please report back if the error still consists

Legit my question to them first time seeing them in close

Autmated crafting - check other posts. I meant being able to craft an item without refining lower tier materials one by one.

Or using repeatable mystic forge recipes just saying for example that I want to repeat clover forge 100 times.
---
Potions don't give me any feeling of accomplishment. Also, we have fractal potions BUT THEN SOMEONE DECIDE D TO ADD FRACTAL UPGRADES YEY. Do you see pattern here? Or should I use bigger font. It's not about bonuses but about getting something to do, and be proud if it.

The pips that you earn every 5 minutes are increase based on your rank, and those big chest contain instant reward tracks with each giving you 25 point to the track.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skirmish_reward_track

I was not prepared for this.

Your first sentence “I don’t think GW2 gets a new expac”. Your theory: GW2 gets one more xpac... super consistent.
---
It’s a joke
---
If you decide to take sides with all 3 sides (1 for each character) during "Blazing the Trail" and complete the POF story with those characters, you can work towards the collections for 3 ascended backpieces and a global achievement (https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Raise_the_Banners:_Amnoon_Arbitrator). You could also try to get the story achievements as you go.
---
There are 3 different ascended backpieces (the banners), that you can only get one per character of.
---
Otherwise, not really any more rewards.
---
Eyes + horns. Patch it! Ship it!
---
That's a very odd giraffe
---
Fair enough. Personally, my playtime and server situation is so that I'm better off chasing the Outnumbered debuff for 5 extra pips, than trying to rank up thousands of ranks to get those 5 pips.
---
My biggest issue is that I have little faith by this point in their ability to make deep, older lore meaningful, valuable or good when transferring/fitting it over for GW2.
---
When they pull out a lot of GW1 lore, they lacked the finesse to make it be meaningful or actually have great impact (Mursaat being almost entirely confined to raids, the whole White Mantle-Caudecus plot being thrown aside in favor for Surprise-Its-Balthazar, the Scepter of Orr/Livia/Real-Lazarus being just discarded plot points).
---
If the story can't do much with those, then what on earth could happen to the ancient history that we -do- know? They've already changed the lore behind Bloodstones drastically, and never addressed what existing discrepancies exist besides 'oh that was then, this is now'; which is fine on paper but really unsatisfying as a player/person invested in the lore that such a thing was mostly in an interview.
---
ouch.
---
I only play on weekends for a couple of hours and do my dailies there. I do pick the box from WvW supplies from the karmic converter, ley matter converter and guild merchant so I can rank up faster since those boxes can give from 250xp to 5 levels each.

---
Concept: MOAR ferocity plus guaranteed crit on burst skills.
---
Leverages the vitality to ferocity conversion of Wurm runes by stacking vitality via Valkyrie gear and a few traits (10% power to vit in Strength) to create huge numbers from quick-recharging burst skills that always crit thanks to Burst Mastery trait. Uses axes and rifle to take advantage of the hardest hitting bursts as well as rapid adrenaline generation from the traits in Discipline (plus even more ferocity from traited axe). Signet of fury lets you fill adrenaline bar on demand and grants more ferocity. Signet mastery trait stacks still more ferocity when signets are used. Has a physical skill (either bolas or bull rush) to activate Peak Performance for damage bonus just before launching the burst. 33k health to shrug off most stuff. Can be modified by swapping OH axe to shield and changing Strength to Defense for a troll-y oneshot skirmisher style pvp build.
---
If you look closely  you see that the cat in that hat has a bat. Which he is going to give Thanos a really hard pat with that bat and make his head go splat.
---
yeah most skills don't say "all" so they should just remove that word
---
It depends on the class and of course on the build you are using. Not all classes have good self buffing like chrono does, as a chrono you can give yourself quickness 25 might fury, some vulnerablility which allows you to do massive damage. Also my gear is fully offensive, best tier of gear in the game. Apart from that I am also using sigil of undead slaying and undead slaying potion which each increase my damage by 10%.
---
It's like anyone with a sane mind wouldn't follow a crazy, destructive leader bent on death and destruction, unless the leader corrupted, threatened or controlled them into doing so! So glad this doesn't happen irl hahaha :crying:
---
At least one Salvage-o-matic (copper-fed and/or Runecrafter's are both very useful but slightly more optimal for different things), any Living Story episodes you don't have yet, and your preference of any combination of account inventory slots, bank tabs, and storage upgrades. Character slots and bag slots are options too, depending on how alt-heavy you like to play (bag slots aren't great if you jump around characters instead of focusing hard on one main)
---
only when hovering over water if i'm nos mistaken, but people would still prefer this dragon over the skimmer due to the extra functions.
---
In any case there's no real point to discuss this. It's pretty obvious from watching the video that you would end up touching the ground. In other words, the new mount is not going to make skimmer obsolete because it will not be able to hover forever.
---
You don't just explore maps in this game for taking in the view.  You get rewards for exploring (map completion, hidden jumping puzzles).
---
If you want to PVP, you can start right away. You don't gear up for it, nearly everything is available for you for free.
---
For RPing, go to /r/guildrecruitment and there are dozens of dedicated guilds recruiting there.
---
My level's too low and the weapon type is unusable by my profession. Straight into the Basic Salvage Kit it goes!!
---
commit die lol
---
I remember and am sort of proud that I never set foot in Ascalon for the first year I played the game. (Asura beginner).
---
Hey guys! My favorite part of this game is making new characters but I always dread gearing them because most of the stats now are crafted only. I know it's easy and WAY easier than other games, but I just don't enjoy crafting or bringing up a material list at all, I understand this is sub-optimal and dumb.
---
But for my question... are there alternative ways to obtain stats like Harriers? So far I only know of switching ascended stats with the mystic forge, but I've only found like 1 ascended drop in my whole time playing. Is there any content I can focus on to avoid crafting / get the newer stats?
---
Copper salvage-o-matic is usually agreed upon as the best bang-for-your-buck item, making salvaging of rares and masterwork items only cost 3 copper per salvage, forever. The other two salvage-o-matic have their niches, but if you're only getting one, copper is going to save you a ton of time, money, and most importantly a ton of inventory slots.
---
Next on the list is material storage space.  Getting one doubled your max storage from 250 to 500 per material.  You can get more, up to 2000 per mat, but that first upgrade is very high value.
---
Third a set of unlimited gathering tools.  The Volatile Tool Pack isare currently some of the best tools available so I'd highly recommend picking them up before they rotate back out.  You might also look at the Consortium Harvesting Sickle and Molten Alliance Sickle, as both of these have a 50% faster gathering animation that really speeds up harvesting.
---
For convenience, bank space.  You have a fee options for storage, whether that's bag slots, larger bags, or bank space, but only the last one helps *all* your characters at once, so it's the most efficient option.  How many you get depends on how much you keep in your bank.
---
Permanent Mistlock Sanctuary Pass is another great convenience item, not currently available but it'll be back.  It's like a condensed Lion's Arch thst brings everything together into one place. The other passes may suit your interests more, but Mistlock is the most popular.

If all you want is big damage go berserker but...
---
I actually use it on my spell breaker! Rifle skills are so much more fun for warrior than de and engie so I wanted to keep it around. 
---
What we have right now in wvw is the "pirate ship" meta so having a fast ranged projectile weapon on warrior is really nice for my play style. 
---
Zergs set up their charge with probing ranged attacks until ready to actually charge. As a warrior is nice to actually have something to do then and I hate longbow skills. 
---
I use the typical sb build for winds of disenchantment: berserker gear, superior rune of 
---
Durability from wvw vendor (or hot vendors). Runes make you a bit hardier and add a bit more time to resistance from buff and others from two critical skills: balanced stance and feather foot grace. 
---
So basically you use rifle to stay at range and tag and be annoying (bonus points if you can use rifle #5 to knock people off any his to their death), then when it's time to push pop your feather foot Grace or balanced stance, bulls charge into the enemy, pop winds of disenchantment (grab the trait for damage from wod) strip their boons and then either switch to gs and start hacking or -/shield for shield #5 and whichever defensive you didn't use bug out back to zerg midline and back to rifle. 
---
I find it's a nice compromise with other builds. Survivability and ranged tagging ability with something to do whilst wod is on cd. You can be  a pug and still add something to the group. And despite the fact commanders ask for other classes in map chat I've never been kicked for using this build.
---
Is Boars still there chatting all day long?  If so, is he also pulling the keep/smc tacts all the time?  If not, then its some other version of Mag.

Tbh, a good part of my block list came from the cancer in chat from Mag.  Also, I will admit I gave up after a few months of T4 rock-bottom and left.  Mag needed a reset.  I was wondering before this last re-link whether they were possibly going to be a host server again

I'm lazy to translate my (basic) knowledge of the Warcraft lore so here is a copy paste from [wowwiki.fandom.com](https://wowwiki.fandom.com)
---
 The green-skinned **orcs**, or Greenskins[\[2\]](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Orc#cite_note-1) are one of the most prolific races of [Azeroth](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Azeroth_(world)). Born on the world of [Draenor](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Draenor), the orcs were brought to Azeroth through the dimensional gateway known as the [Dark Portal](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Portal) and waged war on the [humans](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Human) while under the influence of the [Burning Legion](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Legion).

You can also just buy code for gems, just avoid sites like g2a where users sell keys, use legit reseller lile humble store or cdkeys.

I did that once by accident and still feel awful - sorry, person who followed me to their death, I forgot about gravity
---
Thank you! This was exactly the kind of info I wanted. I've been wanting to give WvW a try, so this is a great excuse. PvP seems a little too difficult for me, but it's nice to know that's also an option.
---
I dabbled in fractals on my main who has full ascended, maybe I'll get more pieces if I go deeper in. This is mostly for alts I don't play a ton but just want specific stats to make my build work... so even stat selectable exotics is perfect.
---
Thanks again!
---
You made me realize the Korean word for clothing looks like a person옷.

It is not advisable to buy from key-reseller sites like G2A:

Giraffe? I thought it was brown cow! Stunning!
---
I agree with all of those suggestions, but I'd like to add that I feel the Unbound Magic Tools are slightly better (but both are extremely good.)
---
Unbound magic can be exchanged for ascended jewelry, which helps very much for gearing up characters quickly.
---
It's also used for unlocking map bonuses.
---
Volatile magic is also useful for unlocking map bonuses, but can also be used to buy shipments of T6 materials (which can be used or sold.)
---
I've always found Unbound tools to be slightly better because I can better spend the time gathering UM elsewhere.
---
That and the amount of VM you get isn't as good as UM.
---
Either way, choose depending upon your needs!
---
check out gw2style.com to see some player creations.
---
Came back after a break and had the same problem.  Sent in a ticket and about 8 hours later with a response saying that I was good to go.
---
Yeah, Fractals drop a *lot* more ascended gear at t4 than they do early on. It's hardly a reliable source, since you can get some very long dry spells and getting the pieces you're after is a crapshoot at best, but it's a good source to supplement other methods of getting armor if you do it regularly.
---
As for reward track exotics, just do a bit of wiki searching to find out which ones are stat-selectable (I believe the Crystal Desert, Triumphant Armor, and Legacy Armor reward tracks all have stat-selectable versions of the armor, at minimum), make sure to turn it on repeat so you keep getting progress when the track is complete, and grab anything that boosts reward track gains (Birthday Booster and the consumables from the guild hall bartender are good, long-lasting bonuses you should try to never be without in WvW).
---
Also, just as a final thought: you can often buy the components for crafted armor directly off the TP to avoid having to dive deep into the crafting chain. For instance, while a [Harrier's breastplate](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Harrier%27s_Bounty_Hunter%27s_Breastplate) is account-bound, all the *direct* components are tradeable, as well as the recipe. It may not be a good solution for you for a number of reasons: either because you don't want to get your crafting high enough to craft them in the first place, because the recipes are just too expensive, or because even that much crafting just isn't worth it for you. But it's still worth knowing about.
---
?
---
Haha, I like to think Ogden just waits to tell us stuff when it's actually relevant. He's not exactly the talkative type these days.
---
I mean, sure he could tell us a bit that's deeper than what we already know, but he's still only a dwarf. We don't really know how old he was in GW1. I highly doubt he's old enough to tell us much about the last Elder Dragon rising.

Raiding gives the easiest access to PoF trinkets imo (minus backpack). It's fun content and I enjoy how all wings are relevant due to the horizontal progression.

Good job. But to me the track seems very unintuitive and it’s not obvious where you’re supposed to go next. It’s funny because that’s just like how Gw2 main objective is.

I haven't had much issue for many releases. At most it was the error message from arc about being unable to find an attachment point or something along that line.
---
To me one of the best parts of the runescape plot is how long the payoffs took. Think about the distance in time between Desert Treasure and Fate of the Gods. It took us forever to get to While Guthix Sleeps, but now we can actually carry around a shard of the Stone of Jas to use as a skilling offhand. I'm not actually sure if discovering all this RS lore would be as fun if I started playing now, because not having to wait means there's a lot less mystery.
---
I would rather have Anet release more skins in the gemstore rather than waste resources on this.  more masteries means we need to go out and complete stuff to get more vertical progression This goes against the nature of gw2.
---
Living Story 1 and 2 I had no issues. I can’t remember if I did for the other updates.
---
If you are below 30k dps you will be kicked from most groups. I find it absolutly disgusting that you guys can't hit 30k after this game being out for 7 years... I will kick anyone who is below 30k instantly and make sure they are blacklisted from the lfg by the well known groups.

It’s like that for the first six months
---
I find it fairly trivial to get to 28-30k, in fact I feel bad if I don't hit 30k (highest I've had was 34k), but that was beside my point. Getting to an average level and thinking yup, that's as good as it gets, is a trap many people fall into. You can do way higher than that for sure and saying "it's better than most pugs" means very little. I am not in SC (and have no intention of joining even though I have a few friends there), and neither are many friends I have who do better. Being above pugs shouldn't be your end goal, that shouldn't even come into question.

Yeah, some countries are pretty limited.  The good news is there really isn't a region lock (except China), so you can buy expansions from any official retailer and apply it to any account.

I just got a response to this question from a ticket I sent in. "Currently, there is no end-date for the LW season 2 and 3 sale..." So for the time being, I think this sale is permanent.
---
Tybalt, introduction.
---
I realize it isn't an MMO, but the ever-climbing vertical progression system of Diablo 3 gear, coupled with random drops, eventually felt really boring. Enemies were scaling with higher health and damage output as I climbed tiers, but my gear wasn't making encounters any easier. It was just a constant, uphill battle and stopped feeling rewarding. And most of the time I wasn't unlocking some new cosmetic or ability or anything that might feel worthwhile, just constantly scaling to meet the ever-growing scaling content. My progression felt stagnated anyway.
---
Meanwhile in games like GW2, now that I have several sets of Ascended gear, I can go into most any mode and do most anything I'd like to do, or take a break and not "lose progress" to an ever-mounting climb upward. The challenge isn't infinitely scaling health and damage numbers on enemies, but mechanics. My progression upward has mostly stagnated, but that affords me the time to work on new cosmetics I might want, go achievement hunting, start into a new mode, or re-explore the personal story/living story/dungeons with fresh eyes as someone with much better gear than my first romp through (all ~40 rare gear my first time in Ascalonian Catacombs my first time compared with full 80 Ascended in the correct stats more recently).
---
Of course at some point any and every game will get dull, but whereas ever-present vertical progression feels like a repetitive addiction, I feel like horizontal models have more room to branch out and more avenues to explore because of it. You hit the top of the tree trunk? Good, now go explore the ever-broadening branches.
---
If it has purpose or I have a reason to do it then I'm fine with it. Randomly wandering around killing and collecting shit having no idea if it's worth my time is what I didn't want to do. But thanks :)
---

&gt; I'm sorry then. Yeah, I always forget that, because I see it as a conversation.
---
No worries. It happens.
---
&gt; Draconis Mons... But I think it's unavoidable that some maps are way less popular
---
That's what I find problematic, though. Draconis Mons, at its launch, was praised for how interesting and unique it was. People were blown away by the scale and execution it had. It even had a ton of large-scale achievements giving players reasons to keep coming back. So why is *that map* of all of them so unpopular? Something must have gone wrong somewhere along the line.
---
&gt; Silverwastes and Dry Top
---
Oh, absolutely. Silverwastes tends to be regarded as the best LW map we've ever gotten. It's not exactly my favorite but its design, from the variety and scale of its many features to the array of achievements giving players a unique set of armor they feel like they truly earned... I mean, wow. That's incredible.
---
&gt; Anet said that they would think about doing this in the future (maybe)
---
Yeah, I'm really intrigued to see what their version of "shaking things up" for LS5 is going to look like. They've heard our pleas for making episodes less formulaic, and I'm definitely ready to try something new.
---
Now if only Episode 6 will get here so we can start to see what's around the corner!
---
Yup, wasn't ready for this on a monday morning at the office.  I'm just going to go think about the world boss train this week and pretend none of this happened.
---
Kinda bit of role playing and just savoring the game. "I've never been beyond the Shiverpeaks." is a decent conversation starter. Still has value today 3 years later here in reddit.
---
I'm happy I did it since it's a great reminder on how HUGE Central Tyria is. The playerbase has sort of forgotten that GW2 doesn't have "end game content". You do what you want, when you want it, whever you want it. Sure there is lots of stuff for lvl 80, but you don't need to be to have fun: explore, craft, do events, dungeons, bosses, gather, socialize, races, etc.
---
Thanks for the reply :) 
---
Sorry I wasn't totally clear, I think I level'd to somewhere in the 30's before I decided to boost, I didn't want to buy the expansions instantly in case I didn't enjoy the game. 
---
I remember completing some fractals before I stopped playing and doing some world stuff in a desert before I quit, but that's about it.
---
I agree. I got into a leveling lull these past few weeks on my first character, and found i could average about 5 levels over 5 hours if i used my time right. I prioritized World bosses, then events, then hearts.
---
&gt; You're still a clueless monkey
---
Yes, now it really feels like the WvW community we all know.
---
Thanks for the help! I'll look into these :)
---
So, not sure what you are thinking with role playing.  If you mean being to role play with other players, the game isn't going to be too suited for that.  First, the player base is pretty small now.  Second, GW1 is a "multi-player solo game."  Outside of cites, everything is instanced to the party.  You may find some people to play with, but you're going to likely spend a lot of time solo.  You'll have two things you'll need to start doing, leveling to 20 (which will be roughly the same effort to getting  your first character to 80).  Next, you'll need to play the story line to get heroes to fill out your party.  Standard NPCs will work, but heroes are far more powerful.  This will let you get into more dangerous instances.  Trust me, a lack of difficulty will not be an issue.  Some NPCs will totally trash you unless you're prepared.  
---
Character customization was one of the grand features of GW1.  You have the ability to create a main profession (necromancer, mesmer, etc) that is permanent.  From there, you can unlock other professions switch in a secondary.  I often ran as Necromancer/Priest.  I had a ton of minions to do the dirty work and kept them and the party healed.  I miss being able to find and try out new combinations of skills (there are hundreds).  But, it's understandable that got dropped with GW2: just too many combinations to balance in WvW/PvP.
---
As for a waste of $20?  I'd be surprised.  That's two tickets going to a bad movie.  I think it's a neat game with unique character.  I'm not sure you're going to ultimately want to eek out 30 points, but I think experiencing the game is good idea.  Hopefully, it turns into fun and you happen to get the rewards.  I have fond memories playing out Eye of the North.
---
This is my  [HoM Path to 30 points](https://hom.guildwars2.com/en/#page=details&amp;details=AIZBAAAwPnAAiAAAAggEAIAAEgAAAAAAQGEIQAAAAAA).
---
People still do HoT meta map farms mixed in with other metas too. (Since they'll occasionally time really well) It's far less boring than running SW for 4 hours.
---
"Release a shock wave that bleeds and immobilizes your foe." This seems plausible.
---
that's not true, an autistic person would've caught that
---
I love GW but 
---
&gt; GW2 is notorious for having the best combat system ever in any mmo
---
What? I don't see what it offers in term of combat compared to a lot of MMO, and I don't see how it's better than something like TERA for exemple.
---
I'm one of the guy who loves Vertical Progression in games because I have a lot of time currently, but not having it doesn't really bother me, and I understand why it's good for the game and for people who can't play as much as I can.
---
Put it in the bank
---
Please tell me more. Who are the native tyrian then? And how did they came to tyria?
---
All jokes aside. I'm really hoping for a Fellbeast type skin.
---
Put on a Reapers hood and boom. You're a Nazgul now.
---
WoW doesn't need grind for leveling? I respectfully disagree - compared to the absolute nightmare that is levelling in the current iteratation of WoW (which, for a new player takes more than 100 hours), GW2 is a breeze. The shortcut you mention (using the boost you get with an expansion) is available in GW2 as well, FWIW.
---
I believe so, I remember an event going on at the time and at the end you defend some dudes burning away the thorns blocking the path into a cave with a boss.
---
Yeah for any of us gaming in the 90s or early 2k Warcraft was definitely a major thing. And wow was pretty great when it came out. I mean the Warcraft world coming alive, and before it most MMO like ever quest were really, clunky to play.
---
[removed]
---
the real question is why would you want to?
---
you can get gems with gold
---
The transition was due to the need for new subject matter in order to have fresh ideas, as the subject matter has drastically shifted every couple iterations since. The lewdness is still subtly present from time to time though.
---
I don't agree. Even if GW2 had vertical progression, it's still a VERY different game in almost every aspect. GW2 literally does everything better than WoW, except GW2 lacks content. Oh, if only GW2 had as many content releases as WoW...
---
Yeah that was Silverwastes. It's actually a worthwhile map to spend a few hours on, but I agree it can become repetitive after a time.
---
Some other areas you might consider include going into the Heart of Thorn's zones and (carefully) engaging with the metas throughout those maps instead. They're considered some of the best metas in the game, each map has a very different feel and meta mechanic, and the daily loot you can get is fairly rewarding.
---
Thanks for the replies :)
---
I've no idea what a Mesmer is or how they work, I only have my necro at the moment :p
---
I'll check out what you suggested and I definitely think I'll start looking for a guild first as pretty much everyone suggested that.
---
Don't bother. the game is totally dead. half the company got fired and there isn't even going to be a new expack. barely any new content, no new engame. It's not worth your time go play something else
---
i thought they have just moved it away.. I remember though that the LA was very laggy as a map and devs mentioned that this Lion was also a reason of the heavy loading
---
&gt; So why is that map of all of them so unpopular? Something must have gone wrong somewhere along the line.
---
It's the meta event I think. Achievements are fine and keep player for a while, but at some point you have done them all or at least all you want/need and then you need a reason to come back. 
---
And that's the meta events. Even if you get the (good) reward only once daylie, it's a reason to play the map. So the meta event have to be good and/or rewarding. 
---
Draconis Mons's meta seems to lack of both. The rewards aren't that good and the meta itself is confusing (my experience). The meta doesn't start at a certain time (iIrc), which is bad in general. For example all HoT metas start every 2 hours at a certain time, so players can look at the time/plan and join easily. Without a timer it's more complicated. 
---
Then you have a quite long event chain where you have to run all over the map, but it's pretty hard to find the next event (if you don't know where it is). And the two bosses's scaling is a bit odd, since you are faster with 4-5 ppl than you are with a whole zerg. Also I think the fight is pretty hard for some players, if you compare it to other LS meta events.
---
(love your flair) i haven't seen anything about elf being troll but since orc come from the dark portal it was obvious for me they were some kind of alien for Azeroth. WoW lore is so "nice" and gigantic (almost like warhammer)!
---
At first I felt bitter that Skyscale makes Springer feel obsolete. Then, I remember Jackal is already a slightly modified Raptor by having tighter turns and more accuracy in movement than a Raptor. So Springer climbs faster, but Skyscale call sling to vertical surfaces (but is limited by the height of lift off).
---
The bigger concern is that Skyscale makes glider obsolete except for wind bursts. At first we would go from Griffon to glider because glider is more accurate at landing. But, now Skyscale will be the most accurate flier at landing.
---
Ok? What are you trying to achieve, here?
---
Raids honestly have some of the most fun mechanics the game has to offer -- and beyond that, shakeups in meta compositions have made for some really nice alternative playstyles. There's so many options for healers and supports these days and it's a blast covering different roles. For me it's getting to learn a different way to play and slowly hone in my skills.
---
And beyond the actual mechanics there's a ton of different skins, free ascended armor/trinket/weapon drops, and a steady stream of liquid gold each week I use for working on legendaries.
---
just giving feedback...
---
"notorious" usually carries a negative connotation. Are you suggesting that games are better off if they have a shitty combat system?
---
&gt; Recently, I’ve heard some streamers and big gamers say they just couldn’t stick with Gw2
---
I hope this is not another thread about the asshole who behaves like a jackass in order to satisfy his audience. I hope not because people need to stop giving attention to attention whores.
---
&gt; Which got me thinking, “Would the game be more popular if there wasn’t a split and greater vertical progression?”
---
You mean being more like every other game that was around in order to have greater mass appeal? That only applies to existing players in the same genre and then you have the challenge of trying to be better than whatever they are already playing. Alternatively you can try something different in order to attract an audience that wouldn't normally play games in that genre or do not like the existing games around. GW2 went with the second option.
---
Another way to put that question is "would GW2 have been more successful as a WoW clone?" and the answer is probably no given the number of clone corpses littering the ground.
---
Me too! I have a meeting in less than 15 minutes and my eyes are red af from crying.
---
I have legit never cried at a comic strip, but from the very beginning this one got me. I've been having existential crises a lot more as I get older... Old... and this strip just stabbed me right where it lives. By the time I reached the panel with Aurenes silhouette on the shards, I was just completely broken.
---
Damn you, Monstrum, damn you. TOO MANY FEELINGS
---
Lol. I very much remember things. Don't try to insult me. I have never ever seen this character before except on the box art of wow legion.
---
Even to some people the mounts are subjectively better. Some like that they can pick any cosmetic look for a mount and they all mostly function the same in other MMOs. Here you can absolutely love the Hummingbird skin for Skimmer but get next to no use for it.
---
Atrocious. Shameful. Embarassing.
---
Inventory management is the best its ever been today. You can put a copperfed salvage o matic into a shared slot and never have to worry about buying basic salvaging kits on any of your characters. Most level 80 gear now comes in the from of unidentified gear that stacks in your inventory in 3 different rarities instead of getting your bags filled with 50 different items and you can easily just sell them directly on the trading post, salvage them directly, or open and manage them the old way. And things like those moldy bags have materials in them, you can either open and deposit all the materials in your bag into your bank from anywhere, or just sell the bags/materials on the trading post. You can look items up from in game if you type "/wiki " and then hold shift and click the item to link it into the chat and hit enter, "/wiki [Moldy Bag]" for example to see what an item is.
---
As for the fps problem, the game is notoriously not optimized because of its dated engine and directx 9, if you have windows 10 then try out the directx 12 plugin. And plenty of solutions can be found by searching for them, most common is lowering the character model limit and quality.
---
On the NA servers how is evilswarm 72-8 ...

I was about to written laugh at OP too, what the hell is he smoking?
---
I approve of this message.
---
&gt; GW2 is notorious for having the best combat system ever in any mmo 
---
Said no one ever lmao. All GW2 did was have tab targeting without a GCD. Which many games have already done. Ontopic though if you where to have 2 version of GW2 one with horizontal and the other with vertical there probably be an audience for both. One is not necessarily better than the other.
---
Make it the Lowest. Even better!
---
All hail lord flame ram
---
Illidan and every demon hunter gouge out their own eyes due to the vision that Illidan saw and then shared. They then absorb the energy from a demon.
---
The horns, hooves, etc, are just mutations of the fel energy. 
---
The green eyes are way more important if you have to choose.
---
1: turn your visual settings down. Character limit usually makes the single biggest difference. GW2 uses an old engine that didn't scale well with modern computing.  
---
I think basically they expected single core computing to get more powerful, but multi-core tool off and this impacts the frame rate due to some engine design decisions.
---
 There's also a fan-made add-on that allows the engine to use some features of directx12 which helps some people get higher FPS. Accept that you won't get 100fps and, seriously, turn your settings down.
---
2: are you mashing skills? I think you can basically only have one current skill and one queued skill, so you might be cancelling your own skills by trying to fire too many off at once. The game is a hybrid of tab targeting and action combat. See skills have a short channel time and can be cancelled by not paying attention. 
---
Alternatively, it sounds like you may be losing packets. This seems to be specifically impacting you, rather than a widespread problem. 
---
3: bags are made to be opened. Open them, sell or salvage the gear and move on. Open bags, salvage all, deposit materials, sell junk. 
---
If those are the only things you're not enjoying, I think they're all easy to work around. It sounds like your setting are too high for your rig (remembering it's an old engine that scales differently), you're leaving bags unopened instead of salvaging and depositing (click the cog menu and materials are sent to the back automatically). Sell crap you don't need. Yeah, Inventory Wars is a thing, but also it shouldn't be *that* bad. 
---
But if you're not enjoying the game, fair enough, but if you not wanting to turn your settings down or let go of your hoarding tendencies is killing the game for you... have fun with something else, I guess.
---
And that is your opinion.
---
As far as we know all the other races are native Tyrians, the humans were brought there by the gods.
---
It would be helpful if OP provided their specs. "4x the power" is a ridiculous statement in this situation.
---
Which reward tracks give you exotics with full stat-selection (vipers and harriers)?
---
Almost every owner of a expensive rig complains on every game's forum. Seems like investing in excess is only a non profitable decision.
---
Why does it need it? Care to explain?
---
It really would just be such a better armor set if we could dye the most important parts.
---
Imho one of GW2's main features *is* the lack of vertical progression. Even if it was more popular that way, it would lose some of its unique feel &amp; identity. If I wanted to play some grindfest I would go play Wow or any of the dozens of copypaste asian MMOs.
---
To give the game replay value. Right now you log in once every 3 months for an hour of story then log off. Raids are fun but no incentive after legendary armor, needs progression to keep people playing.
---
I know people are hyped about the Skyscale but in all honesty it's the most stupidly designed mount to date, If they did not want flying in GW 2 like in other MMO's they should have just left Griffon as the only "flight" capable mount and that's that, why create Skyscale when they obviously do not want it to have actual full flight on a meaningful timer and instead we get a slower griffon that can flap its wings 4 times then run out of stamina and start descending and a much slower speed and have a mechanic where he can cling to walls but then you make him that he cant regenerate said stamina for flying while he is clinged to a wall to reduce gaining altitude? What's the point of the mount apart from hovering indefinitely for hours in LA or DR 1 feet above the ground? Either go all out on a 7 year old game and let us fully fly or give it triple the stamina bar to make it meaningful or just don't create something like this at all just to sell mount skins. And please don't tell me how flying mounts trivialize content, GW 2 is 7 years old exploring maps has been trivialized long time ago especially with the existing mounts.
---
Box was datamined over a week ago. You're LTP.
---
Agreed! I love the “heavy” look of the light zodiac armor, but I’ve never actually used it much due to the blue :(
---
Ram Rod, classic.
---
It is my firm belief that any player should be able to take an extended break from the game, come back years later, and be able to play the same level of content they were playing when they left with few or no adjustments needed. Vertical progression, as I've most often heard it described, runs counter to this philosophy.
---
Vertical is cancer to me
---
is there no event merchant?
---
Not everyone wants to read datamined posts to avoid spoilers so there are many people who haven't seen this yet.
---
... Were you in Lion's Arch 8 days ago? In that case, you witnessed its creation.
---
WIth how the story is evolving, I don't think we can expect anything good lore wise. Anyone praising this childish writing is at fault. It's all about epicness and quips. Nothing we do, nothing our foes do will have any consequence anywhere. It's all pointless fighting. Showing Kormir or Balthazar without even making it strange was stupid. Why would we meet gods? And why are they just big humans with shit powers? It's obvious that the gods are just humans with above average power but it doesn't seem to affect anyone's faith. The strength of GW1 writing is that the world we played in had an history and as a player, we could only do so much. Our achievement were a team effort and they weren't "unrealistic". In GW2, our character single-handedly create a new lore, a new history, alone and against all odds and we're not even the main character! I think reviving elder dragons was the biggest mistake they made because none of our victory make sense. If only we lost...
---
what does that even mean
---
is this box affected by magic find ? thanks
---
Oh right ... forgot to write the rest of my post. XD
---
I think it is possible to have vertical progression if it was something like what Path of Exile does with its temporary leagues. Mechanics introduced by the leagues helps to reduce the repetitiveness.
---
Yeah, I wasn't. Mistlock pass and all that.
---
What is your current story objective?
---
You should be able to use a waypoint to get out of it.
---
oh didn't even think of waypoints. That fixed it.
---
Thanks!
---
RIP TP prices of the rare stuff.  Last time this happened was when Scarlet was dropping Monocles and Jetpacks.
---
As a lawyer in Brazil, I can safely say that notorious doesn´t carry a negative connotation. Notorious is a fact which is so well-known that it doesn't even need proof to be accepted as the truth in court.
---
I agree, without bra would be perfect!
---
What exactly should I be hoping for from these chests?
---
ugh wonder with it come back to the store lol
---
Vessel needed? Prince Rurik. He even wielded Balthazar's power in the form of the Fiery Dragon Sword that Rytlock now owns.

Some weapons like the awakened axe, spire of samarog or renegades shortbow could be loosely interpretted as stone. Also the dark asuran and the glyph weapon skins are also practically stone.
---
The above skins are the ones I found in my own wardrobe there are probably a few more I guess.
---
The blades won't hurt you but the body is solid and can throw you off if you run into them. :D
---
You also see them get corrupted in dynamic events (ones where you have break people out of ice) and see corrupted minions all the time. I somehow doubt there is large Jormag worshiping quaggan cult. It's the same as every other dragon.
---
I believe arcdps is the one that provides the health percentage.
---
Are you sure:
---
&gt;**[The No Daily Cap for the Meta-Event Rush will not make the first release](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/904839/#Comment_904839)**
---
&gt;Unfortunately, we will not be able to make this change for this run of the event. This is planned as a bonus &gt;for potential future runs of this event.
---
Exactly.
---
The containers from PvP and WvW reward tracks meant to imitate enemy drops that almost always have the word "Loot box" or "Cache" in their name will be affected by MF, but they do not say so.
---
But just in case that would be too consistent within its inconsitency, loot boxes and caches dropped by enemies and events in PvE that have the same exact icons and names as those dropped by reward tracks do say they are affected by MF.
---
Look at this, for example:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion_Mordrem_Guard_Cache
---
3 items, the very same exact name, only the exotic one from PvE says it's affected by MF, ALL are affected by MF.
---
While I like GW2's story telling, FFXIV does a much better job. While it does have mind control in the form of the "tempered" (those that get mind controlled by a Primal), the majority of the people you fight are people. You fight Garlemald which is very obviously modelled on Rome, you fight Ascians who worship their own god in Zodiark, you fight heretics (who fight against Ishgard) and dragons who follow Nidhogg (who is angry and wants Ishgard to suffer). Even the Illuminati goblins are basically like GW2's Inquest. They do actions against others for their own selfish reasons. They wake up Alexander because they want a portable home, basically.
---
Even the beast tribes that summon Primals we're shown pretty clearly that they're doing it because of they're trying to protect themselves. It's made extremely clear in the Titan story that Limsa Lominsa broke their agreement with the Kobolds and so they summoned Titan. Similarly, the Slyphs summon Ramuh to protect themselves from Garlemald coming into the forest.
---
Funny how they remembered there should be a daily cap after it was too late to change it
---
Just a reminder we still can't buy armor sets as seperate pieces.
---
Just a reminder we still can't dye flame legion flames.
---
etc.
---
I mean that's almost the description of Shockwave (Staff #5). Some of these are naturally going to be very close to *actual* descriptions of skills (they should be; that's how the app works).
---
Same for the flames in Flame legion armor, the glow and metallic parts in Radiant armor, and Hellfire armor too. 
---
And of course, back items and weapons. 
---
The more you can dye, the happier you are.
---
Quite important point, given how many people complain about legy armor accessibility.
---
First, you probably will unless you make no alts at all. And second, even if you don't, you'll wanna save it for when you have access to the full Trading Post (assuming that you'll wanna leave free-to-play one day). Because again, as per above comments, they're extremely valuable and people will pay HUGE sums to take them off your hands.
---
I believe it's one chest per day per character
---
This only happens in CM Challenge mode runs and elite guilds 30k dps only happens after you know a raid like the inside of your boots.
---
First step for newer players is training runs to learn a raid, then you work on getting kill loot which you can use to show other people how many times you've done a boss/raid. 
---
Only then can you easily focus on dps, You can't DPS when your dead right?
---
Yeah. I'd be better to add a leather-like or metal-like portion covering the area like stringless bras or a tube top, and giving males briefs instead boxers, rather than altering the design of the cups or elongating parts of the armor.
---
You can't really compare a number achieved in a group where you deal way more dps than everyone else to something like SC  benchmark numbers. If everyone deals high dps then fazes are shorter and the portions of the fight where you can actually dmg are shorter relative to the rest of the fight plus you get shorter condi ramp up. So while you get 30k+ with pugs you wouldn't get that number if you ran with SC I guess.
---
I would love to have a soft trinity, though!
---
We can. In PvE. These are gemstore items. They go in a set, like glider/back combos or mount sets.
---
This happened with the festival of the four winds.
---
Well mounts can’t be used in combat so gliders still have that going for them
---
If you stay out of red circles, have AR, and save your two dodges for when it matters then it’s fairly easy to do without heals.
---
meta event rush and world boss rush are two complete different events :)
---
This is true. Niche, but occasionally useful.
---
you are right. But there is a layer on top of that, where you make decision which mount to use now to get somewhere at maximum speed and that is what i love. Every single time i mount up it is a conscious decision which mount exactly i want to use now and not just auto pressing of mount button.
---
You may suggest them, but unfortunately the sword is completely mismatched from my armour, and would require me to actually be capable of dealing with human opponents in some way, which so far has worked in exactly one game I've ever played (and it's not this one). I genuinely like Mark of the Unnamed but I absolutely can't afford to make any of the precursors, mainly because the last time I had money and materials was before I started working on HOPE for my Engineer and I'm still only halfway through that. 
---
I do have a Leyline Scepter, but it's the only weapon in the set that I actually like enough to deal with it and I still only use it when being in melee is more dangerous than I'm prepared to put up with. The Shifting Sands skins would be flawless *if they didn't have the weird swirly energy stuff in there for no reason*. Their aesthetic is clearly meant to match the Jackal mount, which doesn't have that. If the glowy bits had been put in the actual stone where the runes are on the mount, they'd be exactly what I want and I would have bought the focus months ago.
---
I mean, I don’t really do them and I haven’t really reached the peak, I just finish them because they mostly can be finished while doing what I normally do
---
Honestly XD
---
i am sure :)
---
the real question is: does the guild spawned karka queen cont for this event?
---
1300g
---
Give me your email and password and I'll put one in your account! 100% free no scam trust me.

https://wiki-en-dev.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unwelcome_Visitors#Trivia
---
"Hacked!"
---
Really, *more* expensive than NA? That surprises me! Used to be cheaper than NA!
---
Is this surprising? Lol
---
every one would dye their armor in skin color with it ...
---
Exactly. This is so sad, Alexa play despacito 2.
---
Yeah who wants to support the developers of good games
---
This reminds me of RuneScape chat on The Great Exchange:
---
  
---
*Did you know the game automatically censures your password? /*/*/*/*/*/*/*!*
---
Hoping for? Cosmetic infusions.  What to expect? T5 and T6 mats.
---
Except the limit lift didn't make it into the release, they said it somewhere. There's a limit this time.
---
Default screenshot keys in game are PrntScr &amp; F6 - or you can change them if those don’t work for you.
---
For what?
---
It's just an extra loot box from world bosses, with a special loot table.
---
You can have both. You do it by creating new gear slots or systems to increase in power, without nullifying any of the previous work. The mastery system is an example of this, especially with the mounts. Also the living story added a 5th skill and leech to downed state.
---
How can i tell if its working? I followed the instruction for if im using GW2Radial &amp; Arc, but i cant tell if my frames are better or not
---
https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2008/04/jackie.jpg
---
Ah yes, also make sure to buy more lootboxes because those support them even more.
---
Hey be nice to Tc they special snowflakes
---
Different kind if limits. Since this is given via an repeatable achievement rather than from the boss-chest itself it should be possible to get quite many of them per day.
---
I love the idea of thousands of micro-gods warring in WvW
---
&gt;the legendary ice elemental is "hard".
---
Dont stand in the ice slam attack and dodge/walk out of the red aoe, you got this fam we believe in you. You could also run it to the buckets in the rear and swap between the 2 at the back before breaking the bar a second time, this is aimed at pugs since you got the dps "4: 1 bucket 1 burn you are done with the fractal :)"
---
welcome to what wvw has been suffering from on a daily basis for years.
---
You can jump. Type   /jump   in mapchat
---
Would explain away why it happens in the mists on top of existing reasons
---
&gt; I don't see how it's better than something like TERA for exemple
---
#HAHAHAHA
---
As someone who played TERA for 2 years during its glory days, I can confirm that TERA's combat is crap, ESPECIALLY in PvP.
---
PvP in TERA is nothing but stun lock -&gt; burst 100% of their health in two seconds. Gear is everything in that game. Gear &gt;&gt;&gt; skill. 
---
Outside of the crap PvP, nearly every ranged attack in TERA, particularly auto attacks, are secretly lock on. Yes, you have to aim it, but if you click your mouse when the crosshair is over the hitbox of the enemy, it will hone in on the target and ignore all distance moved during the missile's travel time. Melee attacks are nice, but the game also suffers from extreme desync, causing player hitboxes to not allign with melee attack animations, causing you to miss potentially crucial skills because they were playing a race with a buggy hitbox.
---
&gt; people don't interrupt its heal when it is kneeling.
---
moving them before breaking the bar a second time eliminates this as a concern as the debuff(prevents it from healing) last long enough to move it between buckets if you move a bit after the first break. Trying to double break and do a 1burn with out enough dps drags things out more than just moving between the 2 buckets at the back of the room.
---
Working a couple extra hours is *WAY* better for gold than the same time farming ... well, anything in-game.
---
Fundamentally, everything boils down to time.  Trading time for work vs. trading time for farming.
---
&gt;  it should be possible to get quite many of them per day.
---
You can and that is pretty horrifying. I just finished Fire Ele and did some map hopping abuse and got 3 from that event. When there isn't a cap all players will priortize these events and ignoring everything else. Sure, you'll see a ton of players at these events but everything else in the game will suffer(including your time).
---
No we came back because Grenth allowed it, we didn't absorb any of Balthazars magic it was split between Aurene and Kralky, we are the champion of Aurene or were she chose us but she also chose Caithe.

---
Using more than skill one on the world boss is so 2012 :-P
---
The funny thing about that is my password used to actually get censored by that. It triggered one of the false positives in the swear filter.
---
I never directly fell for that trick, but I did try it out randomly out of context.
---
Recipe: Chaos of Lyssa is best I can do.
---
Obviously, not to be taken seriously.
---
With two decimal points it's the number from arc, but you can activate one without decimal point in the ingame options too.
---
I don't think world bosses are worth doing still, this is like 4 rares an hour, I can get more gold/hour farming POF tbh.
---
You get experience towards masteries by doing random shit. It definitely does require a different mindset than a traditional MMO but it does reward you.
---
Enjoy - make sure to join the roaming discord if your interested in roaming :) ! Im rly hyped that we manage to organize that kind of event for the community !
---
When I came back I finished leveling my mesmer and started working on map completion before buying the expansions. Completed PoF story first after messing about with HoT until about halfway through to unlocking gliding. HoT is a lot less frustrating to play with the mounts mostly unlocked. You can run past a lot of things that would otherwise wreck your day on a raptor with canyon jumping, the same with getting a rabbit with level 3 jump. This game is a lot more zelda than warcraft, you're unlocking new abilities as you go that open up new areas. This is especially true with both expansions. I would also suggest looking at getting a set of non-defensive exotic gear from the trading company, switching it on the thief I boosted made a world of difference. It was hitting like a wet noodle compared to the properly geared mesmer.
---
Accessability is NEVER a good thing in MMORPGs.
---
Only if the Commander is wearing at least 6 infusions.
---
Which is exactly why they won't do it.
---
You could make it look very NSFW with a few of the pieces if one put enough effort into it.
---

It's mostly for the super rare rewards that you can get now. People like to roll the RNG for them.
---
Someone's gonna get an expensive drop out of this, is it gonna be you? Statistically probably not, people still hope and run the bosses tho.
---
Hey everyone im finally coming back.
---
I started to play when the game came out maybe a littlest after. I then stopped du to school and other things.
---
Right now I'm coming back from wow, can't seem to bee motivated to play that gzme anymore. I discovered all the new things that got implemented in the game and I gotta say I'm impressed. For me what I'm looking forwards the most to are the mounts man they look amazing compared to boring wow mounts.
---
Here is the thing however I forgot my password of course its been so long. the recover password option require me to remember one of my characters name, again no chance I'm remembering that lol. So I opened a ticket yesterday I don't know how long they take usually but I can't wait to get on and play with you guys!
---
anyone have gone thought this before and know how long these things takes to get resoleved? Also I of course bought the original game but not the expansion is my account going to be under the '' free account '' cathegorie? or sinxe I bought the original game that is now free it is different?
---
Thank you guys
---
P. S. soory for my bad English it is my second language :)
---
I do not agree with you.
---
Great moment for [World Boss Portal Device] to bug out.
---
I could believe it depending on the old vs new specs. The OP could have upgraded from a single 4gz core to a 4gz quad core and still little improvement because of how the game is not optimized. Or upgrading gfx cards for gw2 often see very little improvement since its a cpu bound game.
---
Aaaaannnddddd world boss map chats become total toxic waste dumps in 3.....2.....1.....

FYI: Bonus Boxes of Goods (from World Boss Rush) has no daily limit,  i.e. you can repeat world bosses for more boxes.
---
It's a bonus chest with various drops. The rare drops include cosmetic infusions and invisible footwear worth hundreds of gold. However, odds are most of your drops will be t5 and t6 mats. Still, could be fun to do a big boss train while the event is running.
---
Aw shit, here we go again.
---
*Picture of like button being pressed*
---
For example Chak Infusion, Invisible shoes and some others as super rare, and tier 3-6mats as common and uncommon. 
---
Super rare's prices goes from hundreds to thousands.
---
yeah all I'm seeing is *******
---
Oh, I'm going to be taking this very seriously, Noxxi.

Big smack XD

winter is coming :p

*"Playing as a Mirage requires fine skills, reflexes, and timing. Thus it is extremely hard to play it, especially in PvP"*
---
That’s nice of you but mentor is free at 80 fam! Right click that shadow man on the top left and enable mentor
---
They probably think the game is over since they layoffs and will die.
---
I am also commenting I jest 🙃
---
I despise vertical progression, so gw2 is perfect for me :)
---
its underwhelming.
---
only the bonus chest when you kill a boss the 2nd time a day.
---
In that chest are for example 1 ore, 1 leather and 1 cloth.
---
Its a joke.
---
I do it hoping you win the lottery and we all know oh stupid drop chances are in this game.
---
That's kind of the issue I'm having with running these events. if you don't find it fun, you're kinda screwed because it's all anyone is doing, and other people see it's all anyone is doing so it's just a domino effect of "nothing else is being done".
---
Bonus events are bad for MMORPGs.
---
Your two examples are mistaken. It's as simple as that. In an argument there isn't a great way to disprove anecdotal evidence as it isn't reliable evidence in the first place. Your little stories mean nothing when you can verify this issue in 5 minutes.
---
Anyone remembers the poor raptors near Rata Sum in GW1...?
---
GW2 Bosses feel like that now.
---
I reeeally want to see what Zodiac armour looks like with all the poly-luminescent infusion colours, because that's as close as we can get to changing it :o
---
You know the thing Darwin said "You learn or you burn, my boy."
---
Gw2 doesn't utilize multiple cores very well, but that was just an example, we have no idea what the op meant by 4x as powerful.
---
Now I’m curious... what’s the NA price?
---
Got into the zone once the event was over. Meta was up and been done, but Ulgoth vanished from the list, so I didn't stick around to test it out but went straight to Shadow Behemoth and now Golem Mark Whatever. Good God, so many people...
---
Which you'll never get the whole event. Only to see some loser link his .00000001% drop item in Chat.
---
Right? It's a fucking blobsplosion out there. Haven't seen so many people hammering zone servers since L1.
---
we didn't need another warclaw salt thread
---
Traditional MMOs are not my cup of tea. I think a lot of folks are sick of the entire genre, and this grind for new gear is partly responsible. GW2 appeals to me because it goes against this philosophy.
---
At the end of the day, I find fashion Wars and skill progression more appealing than gear progression.
---
ooof
---
Now someone make Prince Arthas, the paladin.
---
With the new legendary great sword coming a lot of people have been buying up mats in preparation to make it day one. Nerfs to Istan as well as a minor nerf to gear overall with the unidentified gear change are driving up prices.
---
Prices might go down a lot this week thanks to the world boss bonus chests giving out all the usual materials, but they don't give that many so too early to tell it if will have any major effect yet.
---
They nerfed istan and that's about it
---
Quote me right.
---
Just autoattack like people have been doing for years ...
---
I feel like this is a better version of what we saw on the livestream
---
Still not at reset anomaly level of skill lag.
---
Feel free to try and bring any of the other mounts into wvw. Im sure that the springer will be great there.
---
i have about 22k and i dont use it either too lazy
---
Yes, don't play scepter at all. It's worse on almost any other boss, just don't play it. Aside from that just make sure that all your shatters and utilit s are on cool down when the boss starts flying around, that's about it. Largos are a very straight forward fight really
---
It was just a knee jerk reaction of "omg arenanet is firing people, the game is dead" where they really just seemed to fire people not essential to gw2 and pulled everyone in from the other projects to make gw2 the main focus which probably means that they are doubling down on living world.
---
Just use the preview function in game and scroll down to see all the super rare loot that will not drop for you
---
Halloween infusions, they come in amulets so you need to salvage them
---
Dogs? In *my* GW2?
---
:D #sadbuttrue
---
Lawl, why just that backpack in the rare section? *shakes head*
---
Dragon absorbing Magic of a god?
---
Now he can travel to the mists like the gods, thats what happened.
---
I got cancer from skill lag, fps drops and seeing hundreds of necro minions.
---
Came back a month ago, had the same issue.  Ticket fixed it.
---
So you never tried the Warclaw and now you are hating on it? Nice logic there.
---
it's very clunky and inefficient though.
---
Almost every map is filled up and bosses die at roughly the same time. 
---
Unlike Tarir, where you'd get time after the kill to get the loot.
---
Haha I guess so. I expect them to be as bad as the Zephyrite crates...
---
That was a joy to watch. But you should probably have reduced the repetition of "yes yes yes " at the beginning by 1-2, they were getting awkward very quickly and could have deterred other people from continuing to watch. Otherwise, nice editing, pretty funny.
---
No. Balthazar had no divinity in him during the course of GW2. He was stripped of his power and godhood before the events of Season 3, before Rytlock freed him. The vessel would have to had become a new god when Balthazar was imprisoned.
---
What Aurene and Kralkatorrik consumed was not Balthazar's divinity, but power he stole from the Bloodstone, Primordus, and Jormag and converted to his "flavor" of magic.
---
&gt; In the past, the dragons absorbed the magic of the races of Tyria, before the human gods appeared on Tyria. What happens when a dragon from one world absorbs the magic of a being from another world?
---
Balthazar is the first time any of them have been able to. Forgotten and divine magic has shown to be either immune or outright countering to corruption. Divine Fire feared mordrem away in S2, Forgotten magic was immune to the risen in Arah dungeon, Exalted are immune to mordrem corruption in HoT, Abaddon's magic in the sand that makes jackals is what gives djinn protection in PoF/S4, and Sun's Refuge is protected from Kralkatorrik's rifts and branding by Kormir's protective spell.
---
Balthazar was similarly untouched by destroyers despite wading through an army of them to reach Primordus before turning on Taimi's Machine in S3.
---
It seems that the only way for them to consume that magic is by unleashing it wildly first, and once they get a taste, they become able to consume it more readily (djinn losing their protection; the branded being attracted to Balthazar's sword).
---
We already got a tag for cat herding, it's only natural to have tag for pug leading. And then after that, we'll make our way down the animal kingdom starting with the letter A.
---
Honestly, that would be amazing - don't you think?
---
&gt; If you are below 30k dps you will be kicked from most groups
---
This statement is completely false. People won't even kick guys under 20k in burn phase, and really you can complete most encounters with everyone hitting those numbers (i.e [Cairn can be killed in 8 minutes with 4.2k per player](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/98s7za/cairn_minimum_dps/), that's druids' numbers). Not that I don't want people to practice their rotations and hit those &gt;30k, but *demanding* it and "blacklisting people for not reaching 30k" sounds way too unrealistic for pug standards.
---
800g/900g depending on which guild you get the quote from.
---
ITAMFJJR?
---
They sometimes contain datamined descriptions of story-specific abilities, locations, items, and such.
---
I agree to some things you have mentioned. I have designer stuff myself, like bags etc and I deliberately chose a brand that not just one I liked, but one I knew wasn't copied so easily. 
---
I also have some expensive infusions, but I had to work for them, I wasn't lucky enough to have them drop.
---
See the thing is the market isn't going to be suddenly flooded with chack eggs, but some of the cheaper infusions might temporarily come down a little making them more reachable to some players. 
---
I agree that games need really rare items, it keeps the hunt going and I love the hunt.
---
nice try there. Unfortunately adding the "bra" part only works fine with "those" kind of skin colors. With others like the originals it would look bad so a rework would have to be done to hide better the breasts. Not gonna happen.
---
lol rare and half of the super rare are jokes shoudlnt event be on there.
---
What you actually get: Green wood logs.
---
I really don't understand what they were hoping to achieve with this event. The rewards from these boxes are just hilariously bad unless you get a super rare drop which won't happen for the vast majority of the people.
---
All in all I'd guess that most world bosses still drop less than 1 gold in average which is just... terrible. If you are creating such an event why not make it as profitable as Silverwastes for its duration?
---
Because 150 people are pressing each button 300 times because it is lagging wich makes it even more laggy. 
---
Now you know what WvW players been complaining about for years :)
---
Hopefully not the celestial infusion texture, it is low resolution and horrible.
---
I am a cat person myself (oops, the cat is outta the bag now), I welcome our eventual feline rulers (and I didn't mean charr, or did I?). Don't forget we also got the giant kitty mount for wvw.
---
Fair point, It still would make sense for hi to change after such a defeat. The point still stands that he was indeed considered omnipotent and somehow found himself defeated  by the elder dragons and then imprisoned. All that couldve changed him. As u said he wasnt without Flaw and he is far from being the first god to fall from grace one way or another. I feel the change was to somehow show how the gods are closer to all other beings and subject to the same corruptions of character
---
That zerker Minionmancer is more useful than that Shaman's rifle Engineer.
---
It just ocurred to me that we definitely should have "race-maders", so I could just lead an army with a Charrmander...
---
Nice concept!
---
/r/TrahearneJokes
---
\*happy processing noises*
---
&gt; I am the commander and I am not yet done.
---
Well, based on Rytlock's Requiem, the Commander canonically has given up - for a time. Just not as vocally as Snargle.
---
&gt; People of Tyria need people like the Commander in this war, not people like the Master. Doesn't take legendary draconic wisdom to realize that.
---
The Master of Peace, despite his name, was not defenseless. And it wasn't the People of Tyria who decided anything here.
---
&gt; While there might be some grain of truth to it, that still does not undermine the fact that commander was a good choice.
---
Nor did I imply such.
---
&gt; Let's face it, the commander as written in game is fairly OP and probably the strongest choice of a champion around. There are many other notable heroes in lore but what they all lack is universal recognition and connections in international organizations like the orders.
---
Trahearne. Literally every member of Destiny's Edge. Literally every member of would-be Dragon's Watch (minus Canach at the time).
---
That there, gives us 10 people other than the Commander that were viable candidates (I am discounting Taimi).
---
If Trahearne was chosen, then the Pact's fate would have been drastically different and might have just survived.
---
Well, it's a pretty significant gold sink.  Try to break legendaries down into bite sized chunks.  Don't let them become an an encompassing hurricane that consumes your every waking in-game moment.  Work on what you can work on, be patient and take your time.  I've gone through the whole farming phase as a player and it's not a satisfying way to play the game long-term.  
---
I'm working on Astralaria too, and it'll likely be one of my last legendaries.  According to GW2Efficiency I have about ~ 1500g to go which is about 5-6 months depending on my normal gameplay habits.  If I push it I can shave off about 2-3 months, but not without compromising my enjoyment of the game.  You really have to find a balance with 2nd generation legendaries that keeps the game fun.  
---
I mostly spend my time inside GW2 inside Fractals &amp; Dungeons, but you can make progression on a Gen II legendary doing just about anything in-game; PvP/WvW (reward tracks + Clovers/Loot); VB/AB/TD, Istan, Silverwastes/RIBA + casual LS3/LS4 play for unbound and volatile magic (trophy shipments).  I would just play the game for about 2-3 months and amass a material sink as you casually invest in buy-orders on things like gemstones or mystic coins. 
---
Each Gift of Totems/Blood (etc) is only between about 50-65g.  I'd compartmentalize a bit and work on them one by one.  Probably starting with the most expensive like the Gift of Totems/Blood and working downwards.  Later on you'll be shocked that you're sitting on a condensed amount of like 300-400g, and you'll keep adding to your collection.   
---
Basically, don't let Astralaria be your only goal.  It's fine for it to be your "primary," goal but you should have other, less gold intensive goals that help structure your gameplay.  It tends to lead to a greater sense of satisfaction in my opinion.  Whether these are collections, achievements, your skill level on a certain elite specialization or just different builds.
---
They cannot do that because if they did, then everyone would buy it. Oh wait...
---
Interesting
---
Multiboxing is allowed if it's 1 key for 1 action on 1 account. You are fine.
---
I should probably have looked a pug face before making those icons, it's too late now :x
---
All I can say is *"Look at the eyes. Tilt your head a little.*"
---
Don't get why you got downvoted,pve dailies are complete trash, like why should i spend time doing 4 events in some low lvl map? Really unfunny, at least let us choose the map idk
---
This is just a quick Photoshop to see what the Zodiac Armour would look like without the blue. 
---
I didn't feel like editing the existing armour too much beyond removing the blue, but removing it would leave the female character way too nude to remain PG rated.
---
So I was left with two options, either start photoshopping boobs or armour or keep the underwear, and keeping the underwear was the least amount of work. So while in my opinion it looks fine with the bra, I never meant to say it was supposed to part of the design if it was ever removing the blue.
---
Crazy ~~Charr~~ cat person!
---
Been doing 6 account multiboxing for about 3 hours now, allllllll these bonus boxes :D
---
As previously mentioned, they have been slowly rising over time since the Domain of Istan Nerf, but there are a few events that happen regularly that decrease the prices.
---
One event being the world boss event that is happening right now (there will likely be a small dip in price due to boxes dropping T6). Second being Queens Jubilee event in July. Many boxes come into the game and there will likely be a fairly significant drop in price. Also, Halloween tends to see a dip as well because ToT bags drop a fair amount of T6.
---
no thank you
---
All of those are cosmetic though and you can still do high-end content without any of those. What would suck is if they increased the level cap beyond 80, or introduced gear with better stats than Ascended, or added another barrier in front of end-game content that you'd need to grind through. Stuff like that is what makes other MMOs so unfun.
---
Sounds good!  Let me know when you do and Ill Paypal you XD
---
They would be glorious, and taller than the rest, but not as tall as the giraffmander.
---
We get it, you hate mirage.
---
The bladed box always drops after a successful T4 night, it's just one of the floating chest rewards
---
As for the bosses, the meta lasts for a total 45 minutes, where you're meant to be capturing, holding, and building up camps with supply for the entire night. When there's only 20 minutes left, choppers come down at every captured camp, and each chopper takes you to one of the designated bosses (based on location)
---
To get T4, you need to kill all 5 bosses and maintain the camps on the ground level as well, so some people will need to stay down on the ground to prevent camps from being recaptured
---
The hero we don't deserve
---
Yeah that's works too, but I've never run into problems with skills till this event, even in wvw, but let's be honest with 100-150 ppl on one boss it will die quickly even with just autoattacks xD
---
Look on snowcrows and discretize, those should have more information on raid and fractal builds
---
They're world bosses.  They were on the old world boss event timers before the schedule for world bosses was created with Megaservers.  They drop a Glorious Chest with loot once per character per day.  They have an extra wiggle chest popup with a rare or better item once per account per day.  The ones I listed above are all champion class enemies, except for Eye of Zhaitan which is legendary.
---
Where did you brought your key? It might be that
---
Bones and logs, my life is complete.
---
I was pretty that watching this video could help me to finally go into the jail or not. That weapons part is the one I'll followed step by step. ;-)
---
Ps: perfect, just like all your crappy guides.
---
Psst, pm me the female version &gt;.&gt;
---
anyone got any infusions yet? :D
---
it was a gift from my friend 3 or 4 month old
---
&gt; From 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on May 6 to 10:00 a.m. Pacific Time on **May 13** (UTC-7) 
---
No? It has started today, ends on Monday.
---
anyone got an infusion yet? :D
---
So radical! :O
---
I got the toxic spore skin, but I already had it, so...
---
I'm not impressed and won't be doing more this week.
---
Economy? Current black market situation is not healthy economy... However I hate infusions and everybody who overuse them.
---
Honestly claim tickets like S1 cogs and statuettes would be the better for this event.
---
So(sorry for being so ignorant) are you saying that I literally can't miss the chest which would cobtain what I'm looking for?
---
Lol i don’t even know when it started
---
Well as I said, and as you've quoted me saying; GW2 does not use any new ISA(instruction set architecture) that newer CPUs offer.  
---
So you really can't throw out a super modern single core benchmarking test and expect GW2 from 2012 to behave the same.
---
I like the extra loot, damage and AR. All the AR granting augmentations help gearing alts. There's probably a breakdown of how long it would take to recoup the costs, I just enjoy tangible upgrades.
---
before you do anything, make sure your motherboard can support CPU multiplier overclocking. if it doesn't have a Z87 or Z97 chipset, then you can't overclock, even if you use a K variant CPU.
---
otherwise, going to a i5 4670K at 4.6 Ghz SHOULD give you a noticeable performance jump from what you have. if you can get that CPU at a reasonable cost, then it's worthwhile. but seeing that the CPU is discontinued, you might have trouble finding one.
---
As sad as it is I am having the exact same problem. How does one reconfigure this to stawp this from happening?
---
&gt; but Fashion Wars 2 is actually a game dominated by felines that will eventually take over all of Tyria.
---
Still waiting for that Cat Tail Backpack Skin.
---
It lasts until May 13th
---
most recent dev comments regarding multiboxing using launchbuddy while gaining rewards:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b52yt4/launchbuddy_bad/
---
[Single Thread Performance](https://www.cpubenchmark.net/singleThread.html) is the best benchmark I've found for GW2.
---
If you don't have much experience overclocking/cooling then you might be better off just buying a slightly more expensive CPU from higher up on that list.
---
Is mouse child name taken?
---
Don't let it get to your hea...
---
.
---
Nevermind
---
The commander is not a god, just a really skilled mortal.
---
We don't hit harder or more powerful then our fellow heroes we work alongside, besides our connection to Aurene (Infact, that connection is explicitly the reason we can do some powerful stuff)
---
As others have said, we came back due to taking a huge risk and it working, we did not absorb Balthazar's magic when he died (And hell, the whole absorbing volatile/unbound magic I consider more gameplay since we use it as a currency, and it's show that large amounts of that stuff drive people utterly insane.). The unbound magic actually did start driving the commander crazy, which is why we saw the anomaly, and had to forge the shadowstone to fix us. The Volatile magic we got through the bond with Aurene.
---
So in the end my stance is, no the commander is not a god, and thank god for that. We are powerful and skilled, but not leagues above everybody else. Look at how WoW is dealing with the player character, and other heroes being basically gods, and the story is going downhill :P.
---
I didn't know any of these existed. Damn son!
---
NSFW cause that asura is naked.
---
Please don't let this be the thing they listen to, instead of adding 4th dye channel to legendary armor...
---
I think an important element to the event is slowly and systematically decreasing the price on high end infusions. Chak eggs got up to about 23-24k a piece at their peak and this is event being repeated along with Queens Jubilee will likely settle the prices a bit.
---
I'd invest the time and money into these.
---
You are right. 
---
However, to be able to gather unbound magic we need(ed) an artefact/device. Either we get that ancient artefact by playing the Out of the Shadow story or we buy an ancient Mursaat artefact in Ember Bay or we buy an infinite magic gatherer from a vendor. 
---
No matter which way, we used an artefact/device, nothing god like. :)
---
Is it true Mesmers aren't unique anymore? I just boosted one and I liked the idea of being unique. lol.
---
In that case, we're also missing backpieces for Balthasar and Melandru.
---
but but mirage actually takes skill
---
Isn't the lore behind WvW literally world vs world in the mists where we are fighting in point of multiverse convergence to gain the resources for our own world and fight against the dragons? Or did they hand wave that away at some point. So it could very well be god and dragon slayers fighting each other.
---
Volatile way better in terms of profit (24c per hit for unbound vs 158c+ for volatile). If your only goal is unbound magic and getting gear with it berry farming is way faster anyways. I've geared up many characters now with UM and never had an issue farming more if needed (sitting on 100k+ magic now..) while I'm always looking for more volatile (even just to [get more shipments](http://gw2lunchbox.com/IstanShipments.html)). So from a long term stance I'd say volatile beats all others no question (and has better options for use than most other glyphs). If you happen to have both you can also skin the volatile pick with the unbound skin and get more magic.
---
"Just a heads up, you can multi loot this **like** old school Auric Basin meta".  The AB meta isn't being multi-looted again.
---
feels bad man. I saw it as a reward and i am hoping i dont get a dupe like you did.
---
&gt; But in the most cases they obey their orders, right? So do they give up their free will at this point?
---
Soldiers are choosing to obey orders. They can defy orders at any given time. They are **always** physically and mentally capable of this.
---
Awakened, however, cannot disobey orders. They are incapable of disobeying orders because of magical control over their minds. They do not have that choice to disobey order. Joko orders, they WILL follow. Even Koss had to follow orders he was given.
---
The only Awakened to have the choice was Tahlkora, and she's an anomaly presumably caused by Kormir's protection.
---
And Koss doesn't say that - I just checked. The only thing he says about Joko's orders is this:
---
Awakened Koss Dejarin: Compelled to obey his every order! I banished myself here to evade them. Can't obey what you can't hear.
---
He doesn't fight Joko's orders. He cannot. He is compelled to obey his every order.
---
90% waiting around, 10% fireworks show with severe skill lag.  
---
Not fun or engaging content in the slightest, and only highlights some of the weakest parts of the game.
---
dont think Ive ever seen a pug get above 30k on MO
---
That is absolutely the case, with lots of hardware, not just CPUs.  
---
Sometimes we make sacrifices with technology to gain something else.  
---
For example the old 56k modems having a lower latency than their faster counterparts (due to compression).
---
Anyways, I feel like I've said mine.  
---
And OP; I'm not here to talk about " layman terms" or "IPC" or anything like that.  
---
If you're going to upgrade just know that higher GHz = higher FPS in GW2.  
---
I'm out. o/
---
I have PoF, but not HoT.
---
I could understand not getting flame legion dyed flames because the legion only had actual color flames, but yeah radiant needs at least one more dye channel for such a prestige set
---
Having both is great (I've never been a fan of swapping them around) and you can use the better UM skin for pick on both then (try it if you haven't already).
---
It probably came from G2A or something similar and is fraudulent.
---
Isn't that just a Charr?
---
Anet, pls.
---
Doesn't it just reset back to 50% HP for the 2nd phase or something?
---
People percieved to be heroic have a way of attracting fucktards who think killing them is their own ticket to immortality.  
---
Standing near someone like the Commander without also being unusually strong is basically akin to actively trying to get yourself killed.  
---
Or worse.  Some major interest of the commander gets themselves in trouble and then the Commander will be forced to make a decision to let the mission fail, or the not-so-strong friend/lover die.  
---
Easier to live with cats.
---
honestly i love this aspect of the game. I was getting frustrated while soloing HOT content so I could get my holosmith elite spec. Was just about to log off and say fuck it for the night, and I happened across a hero point train and the commander added me to the group. I got my elite unlocked in less than 45 min. This is all new to me, so it was pretty cool
---
I think they're all on the wiki
---
Would you say that it was handled with xbirdtieszen?
---
I like this tho I'd like it too if it was simply being able to dye the celestial parts. Perfect world we'd have both.
---
Oh then you have a lot of good options, I'd always suggest taking mirage (or chrono) over base mesmer for PvP since they give you a lot of great options. Even looking at metabattle's top recommended builds 3/5 are from PoF and 8/10 (+1 being base spec) in the great section. If you wanna stick with mesmer maybe take a look at the [more defensive condition](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Mirage_-_Condition_Sage) option?
---
Because who wants their headstone to read "Here lies The Commander, savior of Tyria and beloved friend. Bested both dragons and gods. Even death itself couldn't stop them from saving Elona. Died of Plague 1333 AE after visiting home."
---
I'm almost certain they use the same texture. Zodiac is just as lowres unfortunately.
---
Cute little weasels jumping on woodpeckers to try to eat them?
---
Earlier beta screenshots showed they were once dyeable.
---
Oh no ! All my Internet points!
---
Was it for legendary survivor? I remember you grinded.. ground? them for some reason too
---
The concept of bare feet is too powerful and are super rare.
---
Didn't realize you were being serious about a joke video. :\
---
No more than 450MC and sometimes you get guilds offering it for way way cheaper in the LFG at random times if they are in a good mood.
---
9k is pretty low for support Chrono. 15-16k is benchmark right now.
---
You're literally saying the opposite of what Koss himself says. Koss outright states that he had to obey Joko's orders. He was compelled to fulfill those orders.
---
Besides that, like Tahlkora, Koss is an anomaly - an outlier. Not the standard for Awakened. He had no free will when it came to Joko's orders, but he still had a free mind unlike most Awakened. Most Awakened, such as Lonai, do not have the luxury of being able to monkey's paw their orders. It's probably no coincidence that the only two Awakened that journeyed with Kormir to the heart of the Realm of Torment are the only Awakened to have some anomalous reaction to Joko's control.
---
And he did isolate himself - by tricking others to order him to guard the cave. He was compelled to follow the order to guard the cave, that he got them to order him to do.
---
&gt; ...Foefire cleansing ritual.
---
Totally not relevant to anything in anyway, so feel free to ignore it and move along.
---
ya know what would have been a cool legendary sword/gs Magdaer, double cool because part of crafting it could be a quest to 1.find it in AC 2. power it the fuck up with dragon magic (hot last mission or something)  then 3. actually do the cleansing ritual and have it say okay now all the ghost dispersed by w/e means dont come back so eventually the land is cleared of ghosts and perhaps opens up more avenues for story telling because the ghosts try to cling to the miserable existence they have or there are long buried/forgotten places underground that we previously couldnt reach because the ghosts reformed to fast (like the quest to retrieve the golems eye thing inthe books).
---
Camp attacks stop happening when the choppers land. There's no need to stay on the ground. However, once you've killed a boss (and you should, a lot of rewards including a Hero's Choice chest are in the chest dropped by your first boss kill of the night) you should focus on ground events like escorts and veteran hunting unless another boss doesn't have the numbers to kill.
---
That explains the chat rants
